5,Swing the Clubhead!!!,"I have tried a lot of things and read dozens of books but nothing has been as productive as the three words-Swing the Clubhead. The more clearly I was able to feel the swinging of the clubhead, the better my shots."
3,Does not curve upwards like MS Natural Keyboard,"I looked at this keyboard in a store and discoverd that while it is called ""ergonomic"", it is flat. It doesn't curve up in the middle like ergonomic keyboards from Microsoft and Logitech. You can't tell this from the pictures on Amazon. However, the Belkin Ergoboard Pro does curve, but as I write this it is not for sale on Amazon."
1,"Get the paper version, NOT the Kindle version","I'm giving the paperback copy a 5 star rating, but the Kindle version a 1 star rating. Why?The Kindle version is virtually worthless as a divination scroll. Why? The author chose to use IMAGES for the hexagrams, instead of SEARCHABLE TEXT. So, if you are looking for hexagram 17, you cannot find it, not in the table of contents or by search. You must peruse the book much more slowly than you can the paperback copy.Why am I not returning the book within seven days to get my money back? I plan to copy each page of the book, and make my own personal copy in PDF format which is fully searchable.Honestly, in this digital age, I am surprised the publisher did not have the foresight to make this Kindle version even more useful than the paperback copy. It would have been so easy to accomplish.If this inexcusable oversight is ever corrected, I will change the 1 star rating to a 5 star rating."
2,"Good start, maybe","This book is too simple and glosses over much of the insight and depth that other commentaries do. I bought this out of a bargain box at Media Play and insofar as it introduced me to the I Ching and spurred me to buy more editions and get into studying the oracle, I guess I can give it that much thanks, but you would be better off getting Brian Browne Walker's I Ching for a starter and going from there.They also use that nasty word fortune telling on the cover. As anyone knows, the I Ching IS NOT fortune telling. It is advice and direction and choices at confusing turning points when logic cannot answer. This book tries to be too much of a fortune telling tome.There are simply better versions to start your education with."
1,Disappointing,"I tried this pair after my first pair of Mechanix Wear gloves wore out. These gloves didn't have nearly the fit and finish of the Mechanix Wear gloves. I could feel things with my fingers, but the rest of the palm didn't fit that well. Look into the Mechanix Wear Womens or 1.7 glove for better fit. Even the Mechanix Original fits just as well."
5,"Best fit, at a price.","These are the best fitting garden glove on the market. The price.....? With regular weekly use, a pair will last a season before small holes appear in the fingertips, so we buy new each year> Still love them."
2,Bionic gardening gloves,"Gloves were comfortable as claimed, but in less than 2-hours of garden work holes had broken thru in three fingers."
2,Don't even try at 16x,"I bought a 16x compatible spindle, have to burn at 8x or even 4x on 2 different PCs/burners. Next time I will stick with Memorex and TDK."
1,Perhaps the worst blank DVD+R out there,So far I'm having 60% coaster rate with these Sony discs.Even the no brand name discs from Fry's or Office Depot have been better (100% reliability in the past). Never again I will make the mistake of buying a Sony DVD +R.
4,Perfect camera for me!,I would have given it 5 stars but I hate that the video has no sound and it eats up batteries so fast. I probably should have invested in some rechargeable batteries and would be better off.
5,Classic aggressive thrash!,"This is a must have for any thrash head. This is East Coast style which brings in more hints of NYC hardcore, etc... more angry. Very raw recording but it gets its message across! I saw these guys play a tiny warehouse back in 1990 and i remember the pit for ""New Song"". That riff right after the solo it made everyone in the audience SNAP. Big time washing machine spin cycle pit! Ah the good ol days! If you like your thrash aggressive and pissed off then get this. I'd say this is the best NA album! Game Over was classic as well but get this one!"
4,A Jill Haglund follower...,"I first saw Jill's work in SOMERSET STUDIOS and loved her style. This book is along the same lines as her cards in SOMERSET, but my only wish is that Jill Haglund had included just a few more photos of her vintage cards. Still, considering the limited space that Jill had in this book, I think she did a nice job.PS: (this is an addition, after review was already given:).... I have used a few of Jill's ideas from this book, as of September 2007. The cards turned out so nice and the recipient loved receiving the card."
3,Chipping Paint problem,"I have been collecting this pattern for 30 years and I have many of the plates and cups with the chipped paint as well.Old ones, new ones.....drives me crazy. I have too much invested in them to not use anymore.Very frustrating."
1,Not Your Mother's Spode Christmas Tree,"I started collecting this pattern about 3 years ago because several of my family members have had it and I have always loved it because it is such a Christmas classic. I love the pieces I purchased a few years ago. But BEWARE, this pattern is no longer made in England, but now made in Malaysia. I just returned from Macy's where I was planning on purchasing many more pieces. I picked up a plate today at Macy's and noted that it seemed cheap, so I turned it over and it read ""Made in Malaysia"". Every single plate, mug, bowl at Macy's was marked ""Made in Malaysia."" The prices have stayed the same, but the quality has plummeted big time on this. I'm very sad and plan on getting rid of my entire collection and starting over with something made of better quality."
3,Disappointing chop job on the best scene.,"The nude catfight is the main reason anyone would want this movie, but that scene has had a full minute chopped off at the end, in my opinion the most sensual minute of the whole film. Whoever censored it has seriously reduced the desirability of this DVD. A full, uncensored print of this film would be so welcome, but this is not it."
1,Useless cable,The cable does the promised job... only at an annoying slow speed. A 4 bit transfer rate feels like time trip back to the old DOS days. A crossover cable can do a better job however both your machines have to be on the same workgroup. Never tried it with a domain. So if you have to Sync/transfer file to/from your home computer with your work computer you may have to switch back and forth between domain and workgroup.
5,Ladies edition,man how do i start reviewing this album this is another masterpiece from h-town that was release in 97 it's dediCATED TO BATTERED WOMAN OF SPOUSE ABUSE I JUST SIMPLY LOVE THIS RECORD MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSEY / JULIE RAIN A SONG DINO WROTE/WOMANS ANTHEM/ NATURAL WOMAN/SHOOT EM UP DONT SLEEP ON THE FEMALE/.DONT HOLD BACK THEV RAIN WAYS TO TREAT A WOMANS BUT ALL SINGLE 19 TRACKS ARE MASTERPIECES. I WOULD GIVE 10-20 STARS IF I COULD. IF YOU DONT OWN IT GO GET YOU WILL ENJOY IT. TRUST ME.
5,A Phat Group,H-town is the bomb the first time i heard them sang man i felt all weak there the best group their is there the #1 stunners. Man H-town is a legend they'll always be number 1 i don't no what happen to them but i wish they make some more albums.
1,Stay away from this product and Fuji,"This was my 3 Fujifilm camera that I bought. I wish I never did.The camera is heavy when loaded with the batteries. It is also big and awkward in shape.In my experience it is unreliable as well. I bought mine brand new. To my chagrin, the zoom unit failed only 5 days and some 30 pictures after I started using it on my long-awaited European vacation.I sent the unit for repairs on October 3, 2005, and I was just told that I can expect to get it back in two weeks (45 days later). To make the story complete, the customer service guy hang up the phone on me.My loyalty to Fuji is gone. Moreover, I will never touch their products again.I realize that my case is probably extreme and unfortunate, but I will strongly encourage you to stay away from this product. There are better companies and products!"
3,Thrash fest,"Rare live tracks recorded in 1988 from Forbidden, Faith or Fear, Death, Dark Angel and Raven. Two tracks from each band except Faith or Fear who get three. The two tracks from Forbidden are from their first album Forbidden Evil. The two tracks from Dark Angel are from their first two albums. Thrash Attack!!"
3,Big fan... not their best.,"A--->B Life was really ground-breaking... this album retreads a little too close to the first for my tastes. They really start picking up on ""Brother/Sister"" and ""Everything Is..."" is probably going to be their best (just my assumption). On the other hand, these guys are slow-growers for me, so this one might grow on me considerably."
2,Dated and tired,"This book starts off strong but wanders far into the woods of analysis, starting at the time of independence. Worse, the analysis is tinged with a very outdated Marxist perspective, common to the region itself at the time it was written. Much of the ill befallen Central America is attributed to the landed elite and gringo involvement with a blameless proletariate suffering endless petty power struggles. The role of the church is basically ignored, as are Panama and British Honduras/Belize. Fascinating anecdotes like the American who tried to set himself up as king are glossed over. By the end, the analysis supplants the history and becomes dull and repetitive. This book is a worthy example of the kind of thinking that has perpetuated itself for years to hold Central America back. There may be a meaty read of Central American history out there, one that is equally critical of American involvement, but this isn't it."
3,"Solid Parts, but no Instruction Manual","Good solid parts, but this came with no instruction manual whatsoever. Had to google around for a good hour or two, until I found decent instructions on installing this. If you know what you're doing, I recommend getting this. If you don't, find one with a manual included."
4,"""We Should Have Gone To The Beach Like I Wanted!""","This was so much fun. A gory, funny wild ride through the snow. With Nazi Zombies. All of the necessary elements for bad sci fi Friday night. Just add popcorn."
1,"You're ""Dead Snow"" to me","The only A+ in this film is the blood & gore but the rest stinks like a TNA wrestling pay-per-view. The english dub is silly and no good. The acting is bland & forgettable. The cast themselfs are bland,stupid and even weird. The evil zombies don't really do anything until the 3rd act. The zombie fight scenes while good,don't last very long. It's very unfunny like Grown-Ups. The plot is dumb and takes forever to finish. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
5,Funny and Scary,"This movie is like the ultimate movie for the people who hate Nazis. x) And there are some parts that were ""lol funny"". But it was also scary how there's an infinite amount of the Nazi zombies and being out in the middle of nowhere like that, my God."
3,Late night rating scale!,"This movie starts with the familiar plot of tweenies going to an old cabin in winter. A stranger arrives with an eerie story and the fun begins. Along the same line in humor and acting as the Evil Dead movies. Entertaining but not taken seriously. Humor, gore and unexpected bravery! Just enjoy it with lower expectations and everyone will have fun! Good night! Ace"
2,deadsnow,"Aside from the gore ,and the zombies this b movie was very borning.during the whole movie, these college students are being attack from these german nazis zombies from ww2.And for what ,treasure that has been buried for 50 years and not even belong to the nazis.I wasted and 1 and 30 min."
3,Choppers field guide,"This is primarily a picture booklet on ""old school"" style choppers. I use the term booklet, because it is a very small book, smaller than a cd, 5 1/4"" wide, by 4 1/4"" high with over 400 pages. I didn't check the size of the book, so I was surprised when I received it.There are a few pictures on each bike and they well done, but it's a little short on detailed information. If you are looking for info on parts and manufacturers of the parts, then I would look elsewhere."
5,funk-punk reggae-rock style,"Now that I've got a few dollars, I can go back and get the CDs that i couldn't afford in my college days.14 tracks... 6 brilliant, 6 good, and 2 throwaway. track 7 (a throwaway) is not a song as much as a credit list set to offkey piano riffs. when i ripped this into my treo, i left that one on the CD.the first 3 tracks are crushers not all brilliant but excellent mastering by whoever put together the 'setlist'. the next few are ok, with the afformentioned track 7 being the low point. unlike some CD's were the first few tracks are the best and only good work, this CD picks back up at track 8 and smokes through the rest of the set with only track #11 racism, the obligatory rap-rock track, not quite reaching the eyes closed, head nodding, testifying heights of the surrounding tracks.ps., the spyz were singing about 'culo' long before reggaeton artists like pitbull came along with buk-nekid booty shakin' girls in the video."
3,Nice Pictures,"Beautiful shots of the kids and pros surfing. But be prepared to be, more or less, constantly preached at about Christianity. This is basically a travel log. Sort of what we did on our trip, and how we love Christ. i would have given it another star if it weren't for the preaching."
1,Waste of my money,"Needed an extra power cord for one of my 3 TV's. Did not work with any of them. Tried it on all of the TV's with what it supposed to be the same plug on the back. Does not properly fit/wobbles and does not power on any of the TV's. Does not properly fit into the socket. Meanwhile I have another ""identical"" cord that was included from the manufacturer with one of the Samsung TV's - works perfect on all of them!Would not recommend this product!"
4,Entertaining if you're a true crime buff,"One of my guilty pleasures is reading and watching true crime stories. A lot of the cases on ""Deadly Women"" will already be familiar to crime buffs but it's still pretty diverting. What I don't care for are the ""expert"" commentators, particularly the ""former FBI profiler"" who basically says the same thing about each of the perpetrators (i.e., ""This speaks to the evil at the core of..."") -- it gets repetitive. The production values are mediocre and some of the directing is pretty cheesy (i.e., each murderess ends her segment by staring with cruel, cold defiance into the camera) but, overall, it's entertaining and a great way to ""kill"" a couple of hours."
5,KB AT to PS/2 adapter,The package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape. The adapter is exactly what I wanted and makes the connection I needed.
1,Can't use it,"I used this plug to connect an old IBM keyboard into my keyboard, but when I did, it froze the whole computer. I tried several times and it was the same thing every time. Maybe I'm just doing something wrong. Regardless, it's hard to complain. The product was inexpensive and it was sort of crazy to think a keyboard as old as the one I tried using would work. If you're absolutely desperate to use an old keyboard or don't mind spending a few bucks to experiment, you might as well try. There wasn't any permanent damage to my computer as far as I can tell so why not?"
3,revelation?,"In looking for support for one of the four primary types of interpretation of Revelation, I actually found Ladd's arguements for Pre Mill a little distracting and found myself going more to Idealist view. It is a good read but if you are looking for strong Pre mill support, I did not find it."
5,Outstanding Commentary on a Difficult Book,"George Eldon Ladd's commentary on Revelation is insightful and the single best commentary on the book of Revelation I have on the shelf. If you appreciate Ladd, you will love this commentary."
3,Love & competition --- Love wins!,"Hindi movies have a lot of music and dancing (Hindi style & Pop Rock mix). I enjoyed this movie. Seemed just a little more lengthy than it needed to be, but worth the extra time. I enjoyed it. It's a romantic comedy. Shahrukh Khan is my favorite romantic actor because of his unique way of demonstrating romance ... and romantic characters whether they are serious or comical or insane, you can't help loving them. I play this DVD just about every week. No problems.I received this DVD in very good condition and everything works as it should. I recommend the movie and the seller of the DVD to everyone. I will continue ordering from this seller."
3,"Fine wiper, but where do you get refills?","I bought two sets of these wiper blades over a year ago and they worked great. However, I'm having difficulty finding Bosch refills for these blades."
4,Worth It,"I got this book from the library, sent it back and ordered it from Amazon. If you are into wire work, its worth the price. It has some really fun ideas."
3,Not really for people who work with wire.,"Book tries to do too many things. If you work with fiber, you might like it. I work with wire and I did not."
3,"Fabulous Woven Jewelry: Plaiting, Coiling, Knotting, Looping & Twining with Fiber & Metal",Nice book but very simplistic. More for the beginner.
5,Outrageously funny!,The Bluths are hilarious! I find the program so entertaining. Perfect small doses of reprieve from winter doldrums. Glad I'm not in that family but enjoy their dysfunction.
5,Great Writing!,"Every time I watch this series, I pick up something new. Some of the writing is so cleverly subtle, it's hard to pick it up in the quick pace of the story. This is TV that just gets better and better the more you watch it! I can't wait for the new episodes on Netflix!"
5,Perfect Size!,"This bean bag was a great buy! No weird smell, perfect size for my eighteen year old brother (I am uploading a product picture of him in it). I got sick on Christmas and spent the whole weekend curled up in his chair with my blanket. I bought another one for my house the next day. Totally worth the price! My couch and arm chair have not been sat in a week! My brother just carries his from his game room to the den refusing to sit in anything else. This has been going on since Christmas Eve. He still loves it and his friends fight over it when they come over. It can be mushed into any shape so you can sit straight up or just lounge on it. For people that weigh more, like me and my brother, we took a few scoops of the beans out to make it more conforming."
2,Only one voice actor???,"This DVD gets an ""A"" for effort, but a ""D"" for using only one voice actor with an off-putting accent. The animation is nice."
3,Be warned- Digital Copy for PC Only,"I agree with the majority of the reviewers here, the motion comic is a really cool concept based on an outstanding graphic novel, that probably could have used at least ONE female voice. However, my big purpose for posting this review is that the Blu Ray copy DOES NOT contain a digital copy for the Mac, and is for the PC only in the Window Media format, a fact which I did not know until trying to put the Digital Copy disc into my Mac. Why Warner Bros. did this (especially considering that The Dark Knight, distributed by WB, contained a digital copy for both Macs and PCs) is vexing and very disappointing."
3,This goes beyond the standard comics audio adaptations,"This is a OK view. It does take you back to the late 1960s animated comics (which they were) MARVEL SUPER HEROES produced by Grant-Ray-Lawrence. I only wish the producers to a cue from them to not only have a full voice cast instead of animating not only the artwork by Dave Gibbons, but leave out the voice balloons. It's awkward enough with one narrator doing the female parts.Other than that, for the die hard WATCHMEN fans, it's a good fit for their collection.Now if this same studio will rectify the situation with animating THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, that would be perfect."
3,"Its bearable, but taken in small doses",I've watched this awhile back because i dont have the patience to sit down and actually read a comic book (thats when you know you have a bad case of ADD).Anyway.. For the most part i found this to be bearable. It captures the exact mood i expect in Watchmen. the one thing that REALLY gets to me is the fact that the females should have a female actor...Other than that.. Its fine. The one comic where Dr Manhatten is talking on Mar is awfully annoying.
5,Best Pens Out There,"I absolutely love these pens and love that I was able to get the best price through Amazon. The only thing was that the bottom of the box it came in was torn. All of the pens appeared to be there, though. Overall, great product!"
5,G-2 EXCELLENT PEN,Ink flows well and pen is comfortable to use. Refills do not economically make sense. Good pen...have used for years.
1,Disappointing Fluff,"If you want a serious Windows XP book, don't waste your time with this one. At fewer than 400 pages, I didn't expect much, but considering what was included, I'm not sure how the author filled the pages he did include. Most of the information seems as though it was just culled from the Microsoft Knowledge Base and other websites; there doesn't appear to be anything original in this volume.I will give Stenek (and Microsoft, the publisher) credit for marketing. And I suppose there will be a few new users who might learn something from this book. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for good documentation on this complex operating system. I'd compare it to a Dummies book."
3,original but bias,"Reviewer: fjord from Portland, OR United StatesWhen I was in China, I read a review on this book, sayingC. T. Hsia was funded by C.I.A when writting this book.""the book is bias and full of hatry to Communist China"" thereviewer said, ""that is why this book is banned in China"".I was so curious that the first book I checked out from a U.S.Alibrary was this one. I am disappointed since Hsia is reallybias and sometimes paranoia.He really did not understand the huge difficulty all Chinesewriters faced in the past 100 years. And sometimes I reallydoubt whether he is a Chinese at all? When he sat there laughingat Communist writers, did he realize those were of the sameorigin of his parents and himself?In this sense, this book is just common, not great, since itis lack of love and forgiveness, the basic elements of all greatworks."
2,Not What I Expected,"I ordered these gauchos as I enjoyed the thought of convenience and comfort and style for office attire. When I tried these on, they looked like stove pipes below my shins. I decided that as I am only 5' 2"", the only way I can buy gauchos is to physically try on each and every pair as they are made so diffently with no consistantcy in length or width. These were just not for me, I returned them immediately."
4,USB extenders,"This product is very useful to extend existing cables (to a printer, etc.) It's just what I needed to move my printer across the office."
5,great accessory for webcan,"This is a great accessory to use with a webcam on a Laptop computer. My webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that I use. Because of this I had to position it on a nearby flat surface, but the cord was too short for my needs. With this Extension Cable I an place cam on suitable site and use the laptop without worrying about the cam falling off, or having to constantly be repositioned. The cable can also be utilized with other peripheral devices that hook into USB connectors. Very useful device!"
5,Good Picks,these were good picks. i had been using one through out the year and got some more from amazon.
3,The Experiment,Wasn't sure about this film; but I always like Forrest Whitaker. It was a good film and I am happy that I purchased it.
3,Happy to have it,"I have put in alot of effort to find Kim Possible merchandise online. I was happy that Amazon had a few in its website. It may not be much and I am still trying carefully to remove the poster, I am happy to add it to my collection of memorabillia"
5,A great help to any Latin student!!,"I've owned this book for a while now, and I find it very helpful for a number of things, including practicing grammar and developing a broader vocabulary. I think that it's very well written and organized, so it's quite easy to use. This really is the simplest way to perfect your studies in Latin. I highly recommend this book to anyone, even beginners! A+++!"
4,Gooey Gum for your Tune Brain,"I too bought the tape when it came out in '87 after reading a review in a local skate 'zine. I wouldn't call it punk, but it doesn't matter what you call it. It rocks. The melodies and riffs have stuck in my mind after 13 years, and I haven't even listened to much of it for the past ten years. Great, memorable songs and rhythms. I don't like their later stuff much, but I love this album."
2,Disappointing; short of Citadel's usual standard,"This is a disappointing entry in the Citadel ""Films of"" series, particularly for one of Hollywood's more revered movie stars. The book follows the same format as most of the others in the series, providing a cast list, credits, plot outline and photos of each movie in Bogart's catalogue. Where this book falls down significantly is a lack of any critical evaluation or discussion found in most of the other Citadel books. Only a few films, such as ""Casablanca"" and ""The African Queen"", have an additional brief paragraph of background information. Bogart was more fortunate in his career than many of his contemporaries in appearing in movies enjoying a generally high standard and critical success, particularly from 1940. Unfortunately those not very familiar with Bogart's work will not get any impression of that from this book. At only 192 pages the book is otherwise acceptable if all you're looking is a cast list, plot summary and some photos."
2,POOR VALUE.,"I'm amazed this DVD has been rated so highly by all reviewers & feel the balance needs to be redressed.Firstly, let me make it clear I am a big Dottie West fan, regarding her as one of the all-time Country greats. However, do the previous reviewers seriously believe this brief (18 minutes) lacklustre appearance at the age of 54 to sing half a dozen not-so-great (apart, perhaps, from Here comes my baby) songs represents the 'best' of the lady? I think not. And, just to emphasise the point, I recently purchased 'Strangers', a DVD featuring British group Keane - at the peak of their powers, nearly three & a half hours in length - and all for under 10 dollars! Now, that's value for money!"
3,not too shabby...,"yes, although you can find on the internet most of the information in this book, the organization and pictures really help out in a tight spot.I've seen way too many FAQ's with atrocious grammar and run-on sentences that span two pages per game level! But then again, if you're tight on cash you can skip this book."
4,Exceeded My Expectations,"I fully expected to hate the FM Voyager Car Audio Adapter and have to return it. I've had terrible experiences with FM transmitters and held little hope for it, but this one solved my problem. It holds a signal better than anything I've tried before and the sound quality is pretty good. It beats the tape adapter for sure. I live in a big city where a lot of frequencies are occupied by radio stations, but the signals never cross! I gave it a rating of 4 stars because the retractable winding cord doesn't work that well, but it's hardly a reason not to get it."
1,A terrible saw,"Dovetails saw? If you can handcut a dovetail with this saw, you probably already have your own woodworking show (that's not a typo, I mean you are probably paid to make a show about woodworking). Independently, the blade and the rest of the saw both are terrible. Your force is always at an angle to the blade edge because of the ""flush cut"" feature. The ""reversible"" feature makes the blade come out when you get caught on something. The teeth on my new saw were so dull, I literally checked with a magnifying glass to see if they had rusted in the store or something. Take the word ""dovetail"" off of the title of this product, put a decent grind on the teeth, and make the locking mechanism more secure. If you do those 3 things, only then would this be a tool ready for market. Otherwise, this is one of the worst things I've ever bought, and that is a completely honest statement."
4,A courageous exposition about life origins,"It is an interesting and courageous exposition about the origins of life. In the beginning it seems to contain a religious focus but if you read it until the end you will see a frank scientific point of view. This book also shows that the Neo-Darwinian vision of the biogenesis is at the real religious side, forcing and pushing pseudo-scientific arguments and des-considering so many facts that deny this theory. This book really challenges our established world views. Read it with an opened mind."
2,More of the same,"Ignore the first movie, they've changed the rules and brought the dead to life to compete in another installment. This one owes even more to Porky's than the last one did. People go missing, few care, the witnesses from the last movie are conveniently forgotten, just the lone crackpot (miraculously alive) remains to tie them together (plus a clone, a last minute explanation to explain another holdover from the first movie). Ridiculous. It also ends with a threat...""THE END, maybe.""Just what the world doesn't need, Decoys 3.Not a keeper."
4,Can Paul save the day?,"It's just another ordinary night at home. Mom and Dad are busily preparing dinner, Paul and Lydia are working on projects, and Jimmy is upstairs playing in his bedroom. Suddenly, the family hears a loud thump and Paul is sent to investigate and ensure that Jimmy is okay. Paul is very surprised to find Jimmy being chased around the room by an alligator. Unfortunately, the rest of the family think that Paul is making up an incredible story and ignores his pleads for help. Once Paul goes back up to help Jimmy he realizes the alligator has eaten him and attempts to rescue him by jumping on the alligator's stomach. Paul may be able to save his brother, but will he be able to save the rest of his unbelieving family? Watercolor illustrations accompany this story."
5,Great Daily Flatware,"I really like this set of stainless and this purchase was to replace some of the forks and spoons that have ""disappeared"" over the last 4 years. This flatware is very well made and still looks great after 4 years of daily use. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Oneida flatware,"The purpose of getting this was to replace lost pieces from our previous set. Although the design was the same the pieces themselves were not of the same density. It was especially noticeable on the butter knife. The base of the knife was thinner. Overall, I am still happy that I was able to find additional matching pieces at least in design."
4,Excellent,"Very good for someone who knows nothing, It does challenge the learner. I thought the CD was very handy, however I was unable to install the program so I just made use of the audio tracks."
4,Good for Eye candy,"The book was very short on information. It delves into the origins for the design but falls short of giving proper context to the photographs. With many photos of the crash of aircraft 2, it should also have included a few pages of history on the test program. The book fails if it intends to tell the story merely with pictures and curt captions. There are, however, some really impressive photographs and they, alone, are worth the cost. This is one fantastically beautiful aircraft. No wonder the Russians were worried."
5,Best picks for strumming!,These are the best picks for strumming ever! Dunlop delivers big time with these picks. Try one of them and you'll know how awesome they are!
3,Economical..But?,"I live in the Caribbean and purchased this to carry two bikes so I can accompany my son riding on an afternoon. We both have Mountain Bikes and strapping them both on is a bit of a trick as the cradle seems a little too short for two mountain bikes. Added to this the bike holder on the cradle slides down with the weight of the mountain bike so the peddle of the first bike may press against the trunk of the vehicle.Other than this it works fine, even for long trips on very uneven surfaces, no banging on the car and no worries about the bikes coming loose. I would've purchased the three bike rack by Bell however to carry the two bikes comfortably and reduce the mental gymnastics necessary to get both bikes loaded."
5,Does the Trick,This bike rack is inexpensive and sturdy. I have a legacy and the rack fits snugly on the trunk. I drove about 2000 miles this summer with one bike and no problems. Do make sure to snug the straps.
2,Not for long car rides,"I was taking my bike back to school with me and the bike rack came unlatched and my bike was flying behind the car only attached to the trunk on one side. the rack isn't as secure as I would have liked but it definitely works for short drives, not necessarily the interstate."
2,I got what I paid for,"Considering this rack only cost just over $30, I guess I can't complain. It works great for one adult bike, but doesn't fit two safely. I was able to fit my mountian bike and my child's bike on together. Keeping the rack attached all the time is nice feature, I like the way it fits on my trunk."
2,Watch out!,"The product is good, just dont use it on a Scion TC Hatchback. On this car, the roof is all glass. It has a moon roof and sun roof. Well I hooked up this bike rack and when I opened my hatchback, the hinges shattered my moon-roof causing almost $2000 in damages. I have used bike racks like this one before and they work great, just dont use them on Scion TC's. Needless to say, I was pissed!"
4,Velcro is great... for kids shoes.,"I'm fairly pleased with my new bike rack. i can fit two cruiser styles on it (no easy feat), and it will fit on any car i ever own, presumably.Unfortunately, I take issue with the velcro straps. I just don't trust them to stay on. Also, how easy is it to steal my bike held on by velcro straps!I'm pleased with it, I gave it 4 stars for a reason. I just wish I could have more faith in it. I really don't want to take it on the freeway..."
4,Works Pretty Well,This works pretty well - I recommend. It took me about 30 minutes to an hour to set up - about 2 weeks later it cam loose a little and I re-set it up again. It has worked well for 2 months now and i use it every weekday.
3,"Good value, moderate quality","This is about the cheapest bike rack you can buy at around $30. For that price, it has done a decent job, as my bikes have not fallen off the back of my car yet. If I had more to spend, I would have liked to buy a sturdier rack, but this one gets the job done for now."
1,Instructions don't match item,"I should have read the reviewer who said shred the instruction book. I made the mistake of trying to follow the instructions. The book contains drawings of an item with a different number of straps so I was confused at best. I tried to attach it in what seemed an intuitive way. I thought things were fine, put two bikes on it and started on a trip. I was fine the first mile then got on the highway. I fortunately was not far from the next exit because by the time I got off the highway a half mile later The rack was in a very different position. I fortunately can get the bikes in the back of my SUV and had to put everything inside to get it home.I am reasonably literate, I have a PhD so you would think I could attach a bike rack. It suggests to me that the thing was not well designed."
1,A serious disappointment..,"I really wish I would have just paid an extra $20 or $30 and gotten something better. This is a tight fit for 2 bikes, unless you want them right up against your car scratching your paint off. The directions were OK (the bars are almost all the same size - they should have labeled them with a number to refer to them when learning to set this up easier). Even when I have the straps pulled really tight, my bike still bounces around quite a bit, but it hasn't come too loose while driving yet. The plastic coating the hooks came off on one of them after the FIRST use(I only drove 75 miles!), and ended up scratching my trunk up A LOT.I'm definately returning this and getting a better quality bike rack. Think about it - if you spend hundreds of dollars on a bike, why skimp on a rack that is the only thing seperating your bike from being destroyed from hitting the pavement going 60 mph? Just save the hassle and disappointment and get a better quality rack."
1,cheaply made - broke during first use,"One of the plastic pieces on the straps broke the first time we used this, making the whole setup much less secure. We've tried to find another way to make this work for us, but it just isn't. I would like to return it, but we'd have to pay for return shipping and on top of that, we'd only get a partial refund. We are very disappointed."
4,Bell Double Back Two-Bike Trunk Rack,I knew nothing about bike racks. I purchased this bike rack only because it was as much or LESS expensive than used ones I found here in Austin.I was pleasantly surprised when I got home from work and found it had been delivered only 3 days after I had ordered it.This item has exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend this rack for the cost conscience rider!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AAYBSW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,THIS BOOK IS A WONDERFUL LITTLE RAY OF LIGHT,"Sidney Perkowitz has blended the arts and the sciences in a wonderful little book. His explanations on the current state of knowledge about the nature of light are extremely simple .. for a very difficult and still not understood subject.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the wonderful world of the photon (or is it wave ?) , and how we perceive it"
4,A cool and creative book,"SPOILER ALERTThis book is cool because it shows a cat's point of view. There's a new baby in the house and it makes it harder for Socks to get the Bricker's attention. When Socks bites Mrs. Bricker's leg, he wasn't trying to hurt her but Mr. Bricker threw him out the front door. You feel bad for Socks because you know he only wanted someone to feed him. When Mrs. Risley comes over she gives him lots of attention and lets him on her lap. Finally, Socks sleeps with the baby in his playpen and he is happy."
3,Comprehensive Book,"I only gave this book 3 stars because of the cost/benefit ratio. It's an excellent, comprehensive book with lots of very useful color photos and great information, but the $80 or so I spent on it wasn't worth it to me. I found out later I could've bought it on the University of Nebraska at Lincoln campus for $20, so if you're anywhere near Lincoln, just pick one up. It's a reference book I'll consult forever, but it's not going to change my life to have it. I think it's intended for the horticultural student or extremely avid/professional gardener. That said, it's an outstanding book, just overpriced."
3,Works! - but what a pain to clean!,"I purchased this when looking for a compact mini chopper to be able to chop up meals for my little one while out and about. I like that it is easy (&fun;) to use, that it's small enough to stash in my diaper bag, and that it has a built in bowl w/ lid - how clever! Unfortunately, the 'lid' doesn't stay on. Boo. :( :(In addition, as others have mentioned, it has several little parts (including the very sharp blade) to clean - which really isn't in the spirit of the quick-n-easy appeal of its target audience. If only the clean up was as simple as the use..."
2,"Really small, as in REALLY small","This is a typical chopper; however, I can't emphasize how small it is -- about two inches at the opening. Fine if you've already chopped your veggie item into 1-inch bits or smaller. Otherwise, buy the regular size unless you have a specific use for this device."
1,Useless (or at least near-useless),"This clunky mini chopper seems pretty useless to me. If someone finds something that chops well using this device I'd be interested to know what it is. Everything in mine either a) jams the device up or b) ""bruises"" whatever I'm chopping so bad the result is completely unappetizing.I thought this might work well for, say, cilantro or basil and the like, but the result isn't pretty...you basically get dark-green mushy stuff when you're finished.Did I mention it's *impossible* to clean? Things get trapped *behind* the blades and go up into the handle. Good luck really flushing this thing out.OK--well, I have to admit this chopper is decent for peanuts--those don't get caught in the mechanism. For a small amount of nuts to be chopped to go on ice cream or something this makes a decent tool. So perhaps that's one use.Not a big expense here, and maybe the bigger chopper jams less--I don't know. Don't waste your money on this device though."
1,mini chopper,"I didn't use it often, but I am not happy with it. The grape tomatoes didn't chop, they smashed. I had to do one almond at a time to get it chopped, if I put more in the blades stuck."
5,Must-Have for Learning!,"This is an engineer's bible! Circuitry, terms, physics, it's got it all! The handbook comes with illustrations, road maps, and much more to help the engineer become the best he can be in a situation that calls for expertise. I love Yamaha, and I trust every word they put here. You should, too!"
5,Great,This blade is great for frozen fruit. I use it everyday and my smoothies come out chunk-free! Great product. I'd buy it again.
1,Deplorable,You don't let us choose zero stars. It looked like it was made in a third world sweat shop. I threw it out.
4,Oster Beehive Blender Blade,Fits my older blender (have had it at least 18 yrs ) and works well so far.O ring is a bit thinner than OEM one but still does the job.
1,looks worn,"the item i received looks like used. it's dirty and has scratches all over on it. i thought they're gonna send me a new one. it also have a very strong rubber smell which is disgusting, the smell leave on my hand sometimes !"
4,Good replacement blade!,"Work as new, or at least much much better than the one we replaced it with. Would recommend to anyone, if your oster blender is not working as well as before. However, I can't give it 5 stars as it looked like it had been used (may be it was refurbished/resharpened, I don't know). But, I'm not complaining; it's working great!"
4,Works,"I'm not sure what the difference is between this and the original blades, but it does work well. Can't tell if it does ice any better."
3,OK Analog Scale,I have owned this scale for ten years. It was accurate for most of that time but now rotating the bowl changes the weight reading (don't know why). My next scale will be digital. The washable bowl is a big plus. Easy cleanup. The only major downside is you have to practically get on your knees to read the dial.
3,I was expecting something else..!,"I pre-ordered this 3D blu-ray movie thinking about the 3D effects, but those are not what I thought..! It last just 39 minutes and is a little boring because there are not too many dinosours..! If you buy this blu-ray in order to see 3D effects, it's not a good idea..! The amazing 3D effects are on amusement parks like UNIVERSAL STUDIOS not on this blu-ray..!"
2,Dinosaurs Alive! [Blu-ray 3D],"I WAS so excited to have this purchased before I start playing it with my new purchased Blu-ray player.It just broken my dream that all I saw was a film introduction and poor computer edited effects.I can not say it worth nothing but my kid live it a little bit.My kid asked to play the disk twice since last month.But no more demand from him so far, I guess he is not really like it, either.This will not be a recommanded disk to play from me."
5,"Knit Ponchos, Wraps & Scarves","As an experienced ""beginner"" this book is full of delightful patterns. There are certainly advanced patterns also. The color of the photographed work is exceptional. Love the close-ups. Our knitting/crocheting club refer to the patterns by color. Many great scarf patterns for gift giving. Quick, inexpensive, using only 1 or 2 skeins of yarn, and best of all, perfectly beautiful finished product. This book would be one for anyone who enjoys a fun new twist on scarves, wraps or ponchos. Check finished length on the scarves. I have found a few to be too short...I just add to the middle rows of the pattern when working in horizontal or cast on more stitches when working in vertical. (allow accordingly when purchasing yarn)"
4,small for sizing,"As soon as I recieved these shoes, I opened the box and they were beautiful. However I have to agree with the other reviews that said they were too small for sizing. They were too small by at least 1 size. I always wear a size 9 in every other shoe I own and have tried on. I had to send back and pay for return shipping. Disappointing! I would recommend ordering in one size bigger than you wear. Not sure if they had the shoes in a size 10, but I could not bring myself to order a bigger size (I'm not a size ten)."
4,Good company to do business with,When we opened the unit the battery charger did not work but they were quick to ship us a free replacement. Everything was then fine. Good people to do business with.
1,Piece of junk - do not buy,"I should have paid attention to the many 1 and 2-star reviews on this boat. It is poorly constructed and we were unable to even get the props spinning. The motor worked, but the props would only spin if we held some pieces together by hand... all in all, a huge disappointment for my 6 year old grandson who loved the look of the boat. We had to ship it back. Amazon makes that part easy."
4,Fast and Fun,"For Christmas I bought four boats so my family and I could race them in the pond. This one, that I randomly chose for myself was the fastest and has the best turning radius, though it does not have a reverse (darn weeds). I would highly recommend this boat, especially if you are trying to pull one over on your little brother."
5,Fast boat and good value,"The boat is almost as fast as a smaller engine gas power boat. It is the fastest for a electric boat. Only problem is that it cannot go straight without keep pushing the left and right button. It does't has a rudder and no fine directional adjustment. For the price, it cannot be beat. The battery is odd shape and you have to buy their special shape battery for $11 on Amazon. You can probably modify it to fit the standard 7.2 V battery pack. Be careful, if the battery is loose, it can move to break the internal fan blades next to the motors."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,I bought this as a birthday gift. It does not work AT ALL. The battery charges but the remote does not work. Was also missing antenna tube. Totally worthless!!! Do not buy!!!! I'd demand my $ back but it is 10 days past limit. It was a gift so didn't know it was broken until they tried to use it :( VERY disappointed!!!!
2,worst service ever,"i bought this product for my birthday thinking it would be a fun,fast little boat and it was very fast very tight turns charges in an hour 15-25 minutes battery life my complaints are the engines over heat really fast and you have to let them cool down lots of cracks in the boat so lts of water gets in and you have to keep dumping it out and my biggest problem was the adapter chord got ran over by a vacuum and we contacted the supplier and they never responded and we contacted multiple other people and they never responded either and we never did get another one it even stated in the manual all the part numbers the adapter part number it also said in the manual that you can purchase them from us or local retailers it was a waist of 40 bucks dont recommend it especially bacause its a Chinese company and thay dont respond"
2,dont buy!,seems like a great toy but after the firs run the boat runs sideways dont know what the problem is yet but im not loosing my time in fixing it. remember that this happen to me only so good luck to other buyers
3,Elevator grunge.,"What I expected this to be was a girl with a guitar, giving us softer folk versions of our favorite songs. Had it been that I would have liked it alot more, but what we get here is vocal-free keyboard covers, some almost unrecognizable. Truly elevator music. It sounds like it was done in her living room, when in fact it actually says it was done in her dining room. Easy to believe. However, once I opened my mind I almost really liked it. It's a case of being so bad that it's good. Some tracks like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Even Flow"" are easy to recognize. Others like ""Hunger Strike"" and ""Rusty Cage"" are hard to catch. The rest is decent, and there are two bonus tracks as well. I'd say this is worth it for the major fans of grunge or elevator music, or those few people that really love both."
5,Epic is all one can say!,"A Game of ThronesAs a big fan of fantasy I can't belive I never heard of ""A Game of Thrones"" or the ""A Song of Ice and Fire series"" . I see it coming on to HBO and thought I would watch this new show never knowing about the book. After I had seen the first episodes of the TV show I found it was a book. I loved the show so I thought I would get the book. WoW it didn't let me down one bit. I found the book deeper, richer, and more fun to read. I would highly recommend it to any one a fan of Epic Fantasy novels. I can't wait till I start book 2, ""A Clash of Kings""."
2,"Great book, Kindle edition is a disaster",The Kindle edition of this book reads like it's been run through OCR software. It's full of ridiculous typos. Get the dead tree edition instead.
2,Kindle Edition Review,"First of all, I love these books. The characters are rich and well thought out, and the world they live in has not been matched by anyone, save Robert Jordan. With that said, this e-book is atrocious.If I have to stop every other page and try to figure out what word goes in place of the disjointed letters on the page, it completely pulls me out of the story. In one instance you just see ""200"" in the middle of a sentence that is important to the plot, leaving you to have to figure out what was meant.Especially in a book so complex as this, every spoken word, turn of phrase, or setting description may be important, it seems foolish to so poorly proofread it.TLDR: Great book, crappy e-book translation."
5,Brilliant,"I started reading George Martin books after searching the Amazon recommendation list. Boy was I got mesmerize by his work of art. I had a great pleasure reading Raymond Feist and Robert Jordan works but comparing to George twisted, intrigue and fascinating stories plot, it's remarkable the story is only in it's 4th Edition. I believe the challenge in writting a good book is not telling the story over voluminous amount of series and chapters but tying all the plots necessary to keep the reader at the edge of it's seat. From what i know, volume does not sell anymore. George has shown what it takes to make the reader hungers for more with micro story plotting and significant smooth storyline to interest the reader. I could never stop wanting for more after ending a chapter... it's just so highly addictive."
2,Great story but full of typos in the Kindle edition,"The story is great. I read it in paperback awhile back. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is so full of typos and other errors that it distracts from the story. For example, instead of 'hand of the king', it says 'hand of the ring'; 'longs words' instead of 'long swords'; 'torn' instead of 'tom'; 'righting someone else' instead of 'fighting someone else'; just to name a few. There are many more, and I'm not even one third through the book. Also punctuation errors.I contacted Amazon about this problem, and got a reply stating that they were working on getting it fixed. I hope they do, as a book as good as this deserves a better translation."
4,Pretty good.,A pretty good book. I think that I will like the next one even more. I wouldn't compare him to Tolkien quite yet but still a very good read.
4,Storytelling trumps all,"A number of the criticisms of this series may have some truth, but lets give credit where its due, the man can really tell a story. Yes, there is some corniness and cliched writing, but this author has accomplished something few can pull off, transforming a complex vision complete with centuries of invented historical background into an immense tale people actually want to read. The more outre elements here aren't really out of place, almost a time honored tradition (anyone remember the perverse imperials of Dune?). I'm about halfway through the first book, and I say -lead on Mr. Martin, grand dungeon master extraordinaire."
4,Much better than the TV show,"Despite my mixed feelings about the HBO series, I really enjoyed this book. I felt as though everything that was good about the series was even better in the book, and the negative aspects were played down or non-existent.I recommend this book especially if you were irked by the show, but appreciated the setting or story. The first season follows the book almost to the letter, but the book fills in all the holes and makes sense of some of the more confusing aspects of the TV show."
5,Fantastic book,One of the best books I've read in many years. I can't wait to get started on the second book.
3,Direwolves? Weirwood?,I just noticed these as I started to read the book and it had me wondering: Is there any chance this guy is a Grateful Dead fan?
5,Excellent Work of Fantasty!,"This is an amazing novel by Martin, with an engrossing plot and unique characters. Once you pick it up, you will not be able to put it down! Highly recommended for all lovers of fantasy!"
2,Great Novel- Kindle Edition RIDDLED with typos,"This is a review of the KINDLE edition of Game of Thrones, which is a wonderful fantasy novel, a sort of brutal, medieval soap opera.The Kindle Edition, however, has so many typos as to detract from the experience. It is clear from the nature of the typos that they are the result of an innacurate OCR process. (In many cases ""m""s were mistaken for ""rn""s, etc.)Game of Thrones is a 5-star novel which has been given a 2-star Kindle treatment."
1,Six hours I'll never get back.,"Terrifically bad. As in nothing of worth. Reminiscent of Top-40 music, where any originality and substance is eschewed in favor of exploiting recognizeable cliches ad nauseum.The characters are caricatures. Not a single one has embarked on ""The Hero's Journey"". I had zero empathy for any of them. The protagonists and antagonists are indistinquishable, like the clowns on WWF, not the characters in Catch-22. The violence is without purpose. The conflicts are predictable. The mythos derivative. The language is crude, the writing ponderous.I can think of no greater insult to Tolkien's LOTR than to be compared with this tripe."
5,Prayin for a Great book...found it!,"I was in the library and I saw the cover for the book a Feast for crows. I had never heard of George R.R. Martin, let alone his Song of Ice and Fires Books. I didn't want to read this one until I had read the others. So So glad I did, Great books as soon as I finished this one I had to have the other in hand and ready to go. Reading this way better than watching TV however it is similar to watching TV because of the characters and the things that are happening. Loved this book!"
4,disjointed,"Found it difficult to follow all the different narrator's at first, but once I got used to that it was very good. Wanted to know what would happen next and found myself reading it at all hours in all places."
3,Epic but too convoluted for consuption.,"Its not a bad book, its just completely over-rated. The good news, it has some really fleshed out interesting characters, but the plot is really schizophrenic in a way. The plot is very convoluted and it takes forever to get anywhere. Is George R.R. Martin the American Tolkien? He's more like the American Stephen King who seems determined to fill his epic novels with page after page of filler (One wonders if he is getting paid by the page, perhaps?) Too many characters, too many sub-plots, it quickly becomes too tedious too read. It has its good moments but by end of the Clash of Kings I was wondered the payoff was worth devoting all this time and effort to continue reading. Despite that, I intend to finish the series, but not right away. I might come back to it if I can find the time."
5,Enthralling,Bought the book on accident then couldn't put it down! Extremely well-written. Great characters and unpredictable story line. Can't wait to read the rest of the series
2,AudioBook,"I am so disappointed in the audio version of this book. The narrator does a terrible job reading it and its hard to understand him and follow along. He slurs words, speaks real fast in some areas and normal in others. But the worst part is he uses the character voices when he says the 'he said' or 'he said with a shudder' or whatever. So as you listen, its hard to make any sense of it!Very disappointing. Guess ill have to just read it myself."
5,spellbinding,"If you liked tokein then hold on to your bootstraps because we have found a rival!! Twisting,turning and a cativating page tuner,no joke. I cannot wait to start the next in the series!!! Well done!"
2,A book for the inexperienced fantasy reader,"Not that anyone will ever find this review in the amazingly long list of reviews, but I feel I must write it anyway. This book is what I consider as junior fantasy. It ranks on par with David Eddings and all of the Dragonlance books. Decent story, decent writing, but the depth just isn't there. There is very little character development, the plot is more or less predictable, and there's little original about the themes. One of my rules of thumb is that if I ever hear an adult raving about this book or any of Eddings' or Weiss/Hickman's works, I can be pretty sure that they really aren't that experienced in the world of fantasy fiction. 1000+ cheering reviews for this book shouldn't fool anyone but junior high kids."
5,book one,once you pick it up forget about everything else...it is just to hard to put down. My family is a bit irritated with me.
5,Great read!,Couldn't put my kindle fire down!!! I really enjoyed the story being told through the various characters! Breath of fresh air!
5,Jaw dropping!,"An amazing world of fantasy, suspense, humor, intrigue, and deceit! I was continually eager to find out what was going to happen next. I love the way each chapter is named for the point of view of the person in that chapter, and I loved how the author sometimes ended each chapter with a cliffhanger that made you want to skip ahead to the next chapter told by that character!! I fully appreciate stories where things don't always work out, and aren't as they'd seem. It was nice to see those risks being taken in Game of Thrones. The ending had my jaw dropping for sure. I can't wait to read the rest of this series!"
3,Game of Thrones not historically accurate,I was disappointed that it is not historically accurate and I am still trying to figure out what planet these characters are on. It isn't earth.
5,Those *#@% Lannisters!,"Them Lannisters really burn my hide! Sneaking, rotten, greedy, plotting, bastards! The Neverborn approach! Tyrion is the most enduring character in this novel. Anytime you combine a hunchback-cripple with a sardonic, bitter attitude, you've got a winning combination. The novel is so good, the last line makes you want to dash outside into the cold and snow and cry defiance to the frigid northern winds, THE KING IN THE NORTH! Read it today."
3,it's not bad,"This book was very well-written and worth reading. However I was very disapointed with some of the things that were referenced and scenes that were very detailed having to do with sex, which is quite unnecessary. I personally do not think that these scenes needed to be in there, but for people it may be a plus. I wasn't overly impressed with the plot itself and for me it was really hard for me to stay focused. This took me a week and half to finish, but then you also have to understand I just read a 518 pg. book in a day and a half. If those scenes were not in there I'd give the book a better rating. The book is very well- written just not a book I would not go out and buy."
4,TYPOS!,"Great story, and great writing. Too bad the digital edition is riddled with spelling errors and typos. It is very distracting."
3,Left me wanting more,"A Game of Thrones recreates a complex Britannic feudal society subjugated by the vain ambitions of its squabbling lords and ladies. The chapters alternate between eight key characters without jumping around chronologically. The story that unfolds is light on both supernatural invention and adrenaline pumping action. Instead we are spun a tale of political intrigue with an insight into the motivations of some of the key players. The manifold characters are well drawn and the plot is well crafted. However, in a book that focuses on the trials and tribulations of its characters I came away caring too little about any of them to find out what fates await them in the sequel. An admirable work that left me wanting more - but not of this story."
5,Excellent great,"This book kept me going from cover to cover. Had to read it twice, excellent I would recommend it to anyone"
5,One of the best...,"Being a novice to writer George R.R. Martin, I approached this book somewhat cautiously. Even though it had been highly recommended by my son, the immensity of the thing was intimidating. However, once I began reading I became lost in the world of Mr. Martin's fantasy. His style of writing is so lyrical it was captivating. The plot and characters, though many in number, were presented in such a fashion that I found myself wishing I could speed read! This was the first book I read on my new Kindle. Once I realized how simple it was to retrieve a definition of an unknown word, I was even more enthralled.In summary, it is a great story written in a beautiful way...enough said."
3,My first fantasy book. My first fantasy review.,"First off, I am no expert on fantasy books. This was my first fantasy book I read from cover to cover so I cannot compare this to other fantasy books. However, since I did read it from cover to cover, it can only mean that it didn't suck. I would have liked little less detail and more action. If all other fantasy books are this much detailed, I think this will be my last one.One good thing about this book was that all the characters are flawed in someway. I do not care for the ""hero can do no wrong"" stories and this isn't it.I will not be purchasing Clash of the Kings. Instead, I will borrow it from the library as I find this series interesting but not exciting enough to spend even $7 for a paperback."
5,A work for the ages.,"I read this book with only the expectation that it keep me from boredom at work. I was seriously shocked when I found that I could not out it down even hours after I came home. It is simply incredible. the character development, especially of Jon Snow and Daeneryes, was superb. The book was well thought out,strongly written, and at no time did I lose interest. The background for the story is deftly woven into the narrative so that no excess time is taken, and confusion over the past of the characters never rears it's ugly head. Fans of sword and sorcery or high fantasy novels should give this book a serious try."
5,Awesome beyond belief,Anyone who has watched the series must read this book. Slight differences here and there but overall more intriguing then the series itself. Cant wait to finish this book and the next book so i see more into the story then the series entails
2,A Game of Thrones,"THE STYLE OF HAVING EACH CHAPTER ABOUT A PARTICULAR CHARACTER SEEMED TO BREAK THE STORY LINE UP, IT WAS NOT A SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM CHAPTER TO CHAPTER."
1,A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One,I decided not to finish the book. I am all about dark fantasy and science fiction but was unprepared for the death of small children in this book. I have children of my own and found this quit dissatisfying. Therefore I stopped reading the book and moved on to a different author. I am sure the book is quit good if you are into that kind of violence. It was just not for me.
3,Good if you like fantasy,"Well written with good description and character development, but in the end, not my cup of tea. I'm not sure if Martin writes in other genres, but if so, I would definitely give him another look."
5,Epic,"I watched the first 2 seasons before reading the book but I am determined to finish at least up to the third book before Season 3 comes out. Normally, when books are made into movies or series, they are not done to justice. This is an exception. It is a fantastic, easy-to-read book and I am wasting no time in buying the second book (even though I know what happens) as well as the rest of the series. I do not read as often as I like and I often start books and never get to finishing them, but I could hardly put this one down. It is an epic I'd put in the same category as Lord of the Rings."
2,I think this guy is over-rated,"I don't see the why there is such a buzz about this book. I've read most of the fantasy/sci-fi authors that you can think of off the top of your head. I don't think Martin is in the same league with Tolkien, Jordan, Tad Williams, or Feist. I thought the book was well writen, but lacked novelty, wit, and most of all creativity. It read more like a romance novel. This book now holds up my window. I suggest raeding Fritz Lieber, Micheal Stackpole, Gene Wolf, and Tad Williams."
1,Disgusted,I got about 50 pages into the book before concluding that George R. R. Martin was writing about a disgusting Pedophile - Khal Drogo. I can't see how an author can write about that sort of thing without imagining the acts themselves in his own mind. No matter how richly the book is written this is unnecessary.
4,"Complex, intriguing fantasy world","A good, but long read. This is a complex fantasy with many characters and is the first in a series in what looks to be a long and complicated history. Each chapter is told from a different character's perspective and I was grateful for the summary of characters in the back as there are many. However, it did not take long to get them straight. This style is intriguing as you are kept in suspense until the next appearance of the character to find out what is going on in one of the many plots/subplots. The Stark family is quite interesting and I look forward to seeing what role the direwolf pups will take. The author has created a unique world and he is not afraid to kill off characters when necessary. This book has lots of action and intrigue. It took me a while to get into and a while to read (835 pages!) and the next one looks just as long. However, it is worth working through and I look forward to delving into the next book to see how this world develops."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"My biases: I love Goodkind, I like WOT but downhill seriously lately. I loved Eddings, Donaldson, Tolkien. I love magic, action, battles.I always read any new fantasy series I start at least a hundred pages before tossing it out. As other reviewers have commented the book has little magic and action and is very political. A soap opera fantasy is probably a good way to describe it. Perhaps comparing Star Trek Deep Space Nine to the other Treks is helpful. I like all the other Treks but found DS9 to be a space soap opera and tossed it. This is what Game of Thrones is like.I am very disappointed since, after reading other reviews, I was expecting great things from Game of Thrones. Starting the book is rather difficult also since the character you are reading about is constantly changing.So I am out my 7 bucks.If you haven't tried Terry Goodkind yet, I highly recommend his work. It blows WOT out of the water and continues to be extremely interesting and very moving."
5,Outstanding,"Outstanding character development! Few of the characters are what we assume, one minute you loath them and the next you wish to champion their cause. The only other author that does this succesfully is Guy Kay. A truly epic fantasy! Expect the unexpected! You don't need to read far into the book before you realize that you can't anticipate the story, you must read on and let Martin tell his tale. A Game of Thrones is an outstanding book! Aftrer finishing the book I only hope that Martin continues to write, and fast!"
2,Not a good read,"I heard wonderful things about this book from many people. However, I couldn't get past the way it was written. Each chapter is titled with the character it is written about. There was only one character I really liked, I found myself skipping to those chapters about 3/4 through the book. If you are looking for an action packed adventurous book, I don't suggest this one. Poor format and lack of character development will keep me from reading any more. I will watch the series on HBO though, I am hopeful they can make this something enjoyable."
5,What was that?!,"And I have thought I've read everything. From the Lord of the rings to The wheel of time, and that no-ont, but no-one can enlighten me. Well... Mr. Martin succeeded beyond my wildest imagination. Well done!! RJ wrote on the cover that this work is unbelievable, maybe he can learn a trick or two."
5,The best High Fantasy I've read since Tolkien,"Martin's world and his characters and his storyline are fantastic - and plausible. Everything happens for a reason, and nothing is simple. I think Martin has found an excellent balance between the elegant but plodding Lord of the Rings and Robert Jordan's joyful but childish Wheel of Time. A touch of magic and monsters give this world color but the drama is very very human; for awhile I wondered whether this was even a fantasy book or if the characters' references to the paranormal were simply their own superstition. Game of Thrones is not a complete work in and of itself and all the major plot lines are left unresolved, some in a state of supreme tension. But at least so far the story unfolds at a determined clip and there isn't much filler. Many of the characters are very deep and I'm told that over the course of the series they change and evolve and force the reader to reevaluate."
5,Excellent,Picked up this book long ago. Put it down twice. Third time a charm. Perhaps one of my three favorite fantasy series of all time. Glad I tried again.
2,Seires will never be completed,"If you are thinking about purchasing this book, you should know two things. First, as the first book of a series, it is spectacular. Second, it's the first book of a series that is unlikely to be finished. For the past ten years, Martin has been writing about a five year period of the story he never intended to write about. Originally the series had a five year time gap between books three and four. In that time he has published one book, containing half the characters and covering about two years of the gap. Five years later we are waiting for the other half of the characters contained in ADWD, a book that was half complete five years ago.If you don't mind unfinished stories, by all means read this book. However, I recommend keeping this on the to read list until the series is finished."
1,This book is crap!,I wish I could give this book lower than one star. I don't know when fantasy became swords and rape. I wish I had read the reviews of this book before I picked it up.
5,No words,Simply magical and amazing. Read the book in two days. I was hooked from the prologue. Indescribable and highly recommended
5,couldn't put it down,Even though I had already watched the HBO series I loved this book. I was able to follow the story line.
4,Good read,I didn't think I would be able to read this book to begin with as I found it very hard to get into; however after about 5 chapters and hard concentration I was loving it. I am looking forward to reading the second book in the series now.
4,Plots Galore!,"Slow starting and with at least six plots at any one time, the urge to put the book down and start something else was a constant desire. But then as the writing style grows on you and the characters become more human and real, you find that you can't put the book down... and then it just stops leaving you to yearn for the next in the series. Great fiction, good storytelling, a bit slow to start but tough it out and enjoy!"
4,A good book with flaws,"First off this is a very good book. The characters are well written and there are some intresting plot twists. I like every thing about the book and would have given it a higher review if it wasn't for its two flaws. First I think the book needs some editing. Not much but a bit. Secondly I think it does somewhat of a poor job helping you keep track of all the players through out the story. The problem is only there in the start, after a while you just pick up on who's, who. But a great book should be easly accessable from the start to finish. Really those are my only beefs I recomend it to a fantasy buff (not a person looking for a lot of wizards). Over all though the 2 flaws shouldnt be enough to keep anyone from reading it, so enjoy"
1,What is the deal with the love for this book?,"I started reading this book based on some fairly serious recommendations from good friends of mine. I have been reading fantasy all my life. There's a TV show that has gotten rave reviews, and it looked interesting. I would hate to watch this series without reading the books.Plus, this book seems to be the Lord of the Rings for the generation ten years younger than me. I figured I really should read it if only to say I had read it.Man, what a task. This book left me quite frustrated at the end. Nothing happens of any consequence. The characters are completely cliched people who are cardboard cutouts. I still finished the book, and I would say it is enjoyable only slightly, because his writing can be quite descriptive. But game of thrones is to High Fantasy what Pirates of the Caribbean is to the golden age of pirates. It's just a shell. This book bored me to tears."
2,Dark and complicated but not in a good way,"Wanted to like it. Great cover nice premise. But the created world is overly complex, the writing was hard to follow (he jumps from character to character to character and not even in a way you can easily skip the characters you don't like) and a lot of unlikeable characters.If you are looking for fiction which validates the view that the world is an awful place, full of awful things that happen, and good people are doomed to horrible fates, you would probably like this very much."
5,I'm Hooked,"I'm hooked. Didn't see the HBO production, but saw the books marketed in the bookstore during its run on cable. Picked it up a few times and decided on something else. Finally took a chance with my Kindle and couldn't put it down. The character development is great and I immediately formed strong opinions of them. A wonderful mix of historical fiction and fantasy. Off to download book two."
1,Don't start reading until Martin finishes the series!!!!!,"I'm rating this a one as a service to people who have not yet read it.I've been reading this series since the original publication in 1997, impatiently awaiting its completion with the third novel in the planned trilogy, which turned out to be book 3 of a series of at least 6 books (book 5 is not the end!!!). Book 2 didn't appear until 2002, book 3 in 2003, book 4 in 2007, and book 5 in 2011.Is it unreasonable to expect an author to have a plan for a book and follow it? Martin has clearly gotten lost somewhere in the land of imagination and can't get out.Don't get started, you'll regret it if you do.On the other hand, it's a great story, great characters, and I can't wait until the next in the series. But since I'm 66 years old, I'll probably be dead before he finishes."
5,A good read,"Like many people, after seeing the first few episodes on HBO I had to get the book. I'm glad I did because this book is full of detail that the TV series leaves out. Definitely worth reading before watching.This world Martin has created seems to be magic-less at least for the time being. Dragons have died off or have been slain, the children are gone, and what lurks beyond the wall seems to stay put. This book is focused on characters and you really get to know them as a reader. You see the world through their eyes and you understand the choices they make (even though they may be foolish or wrong). There is a lot of history behind these major Houses and families with marriages and relationships making everything deliciously more complicated as the story plays out.This book will end with you digging through your pants pocket for that credit card so you can order Clash of Kings."
5,Fantastic,"Caution: as mentioned previously in nearly every other comment, it's a very intense, graphic, and somewhat sad novel. But all that aside (if that's possible heh) it's incredibly well written...content as well as structure. Worth every moment I woke up two hours early and stayed up two hours late every night just to burn through it's riveting plotlines."
5,Breath-taking-one-of-the-best-books-I-ever-read,"After reading Robert Jordan's Wheels of Time I found it hard to concentrate on another book. Well, that changed when I saw George Martin's A Game of Thrones in the bookstore. At first it was Jordan's comment on the book that lured me into reading it. But then it got to me, it shook me out of this I-am-still-to-deep-into-the-WoT-feeling. What a grant story! It picked me up and swept me through it, leaving me wanting to go further reading about the characters I came to love and hate. The waiting is almost done."
1,I should have read more reviews before purchasing this book,"Having just completed the 12th book in R.Jordan's ""Eye of the World"" series, and being new to the genre, I have been searching for a new series author that I can dig into and enjoy. This is definitely not it for me.Without getting into too much detail, I was put off quickly by the incessant use of foul language, sordid sex/incest scenarios, and generally disgusting behavior in the first pages I could get through. I was not intrugued by this, I was really put off by it and subsequently stopped reading.In retrospect I should have read a few more reviews of this book. In doing so I may have come to the conclusion that this is not the book/series/author for me."
3,I just didn't care...,"The first time I read this was after I read the Lord of the Rings. (Yes, I've just gotten into Tolkien.) I love LotR so much that I wanted another story to be just like it. This was not. So I put the book away for a while until I realized that there can only be one Tolkien. So, I read a few more fantasy books, enjoyed them (Thomas Covenant Series was excellent) and then came back to Game of Thrones. Again, I just couldn't get into the story. I just didn't care what happened. The author didn't make me care about what happens. He is a good writer and he will appeal to many readers, just not this one."
3,game of thrones,If you have forever this is a great series. Loved the first book and watching theseries on tv. Will read the second to the end eventualy
1,Author doesn't care if series is ever finished,On his website he has answered all those asking why the next installment is a year overdue. After whining about missing several conventions in order to work on the book he refers to his readers as trolls. I guess only those who worship him are worthy. It seems the man is too in love with himself to bother with the trolls who have made him rich.Think twice before investing your time and money with this egotistical jerk. He obviously has no idea what to do with his story. I have serious doubts as to his ability to finish this series as he seems to be more interested in other projects than finishing what he started.
1,horrible surprise,From all the hype I had expected an exciting new fantasy series. What I found was a fifties throwback to the all-powerful he-men and their pitiful subordinate women. Really? In 2011? About as cutting edge as L. Ron Hubbard. Worse than a waste of $10 and an hour - don't bother.
5,Game of Thrones,"I enjoyed Game of Thrones so much. It was difficult for the first 50 pages or so to get into the language all of the characters. My advice: go to the very back of the book as reference where they have all of the kingdoms listed with all of the relationships of the characters. It will definitely put it in order for you! Then, ENJOY!!!"
1,Do not buy this product!,"I live in a major summer vacation area and was extermely excited when I noticed these convienient bike carriers everywhere last year. I asked a woman where she found hers and she said that she loved it for transporting her one bicycle around the area. This Christmas I added this to my list thinking it would be great to take our three children riding more often. I followed the instructions implicitly and was not at all put off by the difficulty I had getting the bikes fitted and tightly secured. Come on- I wasn't expecting cheap, convient, and easy to all come together perfectly, but I was extremely infuriated when the day after our first trip, my husband noticed a 4 inch pressure dent in the rear of our vehicle. I will be contacting BELL when they open on Monday."
4,Great for the price!,"I've had this bike rack since last summer and have had no problems with it. It states clearly in the directions to make sure the area where you place the padded bars is clean. If there is any debris between the pad and car, it will scratch your paint. This has nothing to do with the rack itself. I have driven my car 300 miles in each direction with 2 bikes on the rack. I have no complaints. I found it easy to use and it gets the job done."
2,Works but will dent cars,"Both my friend and I bought the rack and was planning on hauling 6 bikes about 200 miles. When we got to our destination, we noticed that there were several major dents on both our cars. This rack will get you to the place you want, but will also leave noticeable dents in your car."
2,Bell Bike Carrier,I bought this rack because it didn't require a hitch but it was somewhat unstable - I had to keep stopping to re-tighten the bikes.I stopped using the carrier completely when one of the plastic braces broke in transit causing bike to get dragged behind the car until I could pull over.This is probably only good for hauling children's bikes.
1,No activity,Worst thing I have ever seen. I struggled to stay awake in the middle of the morning. I was doing the math after 15 minutes to figure out when it would end. I was laughing out loud the last 10 minutes. If I could I would rate it -5 stars. I can't believe this ever got a distributor.
1,Entertainment for low-brows,"I can see how a movie like this can become popular in today's (American) society, where a high percentage of movie-paying teens have the mental compacity of an eight-year-old (anyone who takes even a little time to read about the current state of education in this country and how mentally stumped teenagers are today compared to teens from only twenty years ago will back me up). Eight-year-olds are easy to scare, so, by extension, today's teens would be, too. As for the rest of us who sat through this dreck, it was an insult to our intelligence. I found myself laughing at things that weren't intentionally funny. But what made me laugh even more was knowing that so many teenagers and young adults (at least the ones who actually stopped long enough from texting to watch the movie) were actually scared by this superficial tripe. That was the real entertainment."
3,decent plot,"This was actually pretty good. Decent plot.In 86 minutes, there's about 80 minutes of plot/cheap tricks. And maybe a combined total of 6 minutes of totally scary stuff."
3,mmm... needed more,It wasn't that scary... It could have had more. can't wait for the second though.
1,We Just Don't Get The Hype,"This movie has made a lot of money for the producers, it is not scary nor tense. It may or may not be based on any fact or ""really"" happened. We've seen this before with ""Blair Witch"", a DVD that now can be found in any bargain bin, an over hyped POC that will waste about 90 min. of your life. We had no sleepless nights, no bumps in the night, no spirits creeping around us ... nothing as a result of watching this movie.. but judge for yourself! .. This is not a 'hate' we've seen 100's of far, far better horror movies."
2,BWP had a kid and its just like her parents,"This is pitiful.Better than BWP but thats like saying falling from a 50 story building is better than falling from a 53 story building.Women will absolutely love this.Effemmine guys will love it.Guys will let their girlfriends tell them they loved it.i went for free (except for gas money) and still left angry. sure, there was plenty of the above-mentioned shrieking in anticipation. i was waiting....waiting....still waiting....nada !glancing over the legnth of some reviews is scarier than the movie. how on earth did paranormal borebom illicit not only ratings above 2 stars but 25000 word essays ?!?!?!?!?ghosts, imho, are the equivalent of the mummy circa 1950; plodding slowly reaching at victim with 1 arm. you can easily avoid but youre just too stupid. you might as well choke yourself.other than cloverfield, cam movies are all hype and no pay-off. if this learned ANYTHING from BWP, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SEQUEL !"
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I'll be a man and admit it... This movie made me jump quite a few times and left me thinking about it long after it was over. I have been a Horror fan for a long time and that's a very unusual reaction for me. Some people didn't like how it was filmed on camcorders or how it started out slowly, but not me, I thought this was a great movie and new territory for the genre. This is one they'll be talking about for a while."
4,Paranormal Activity the movie,Movie was like a documentary or a home movie. Reminds me of Blair Witch project only more interesting. Its definately something to see. My husband and I watched it at Halloween time which made it more fun.
1,Not scary,"This movie was hyped up to be incredibly scary so when I watched it with my girlfriend I kept saying ""wait for it. It'll get scary soon"" I kept saying that then next thing I knew the credits were rolling and I wasn't scared at all."
3,Worth the rental with a few good scares.,"Okay, they should have gotten out of the house way before they did, but all in all it was a movie that was kind of creepy and made you jump a few times. I recommend it knowing it is a low budget thriller, no better or worse than lots of other high budget ""scary"" movies. I enjoyed it and actually thought about it afterwards which most movies I don't. It seems it is one that you will love or hate. I loved ""The Blair Witch Project."" If you didn't like it, you probably won't like this. Considering it was made on an $11,000 budget, not bad at all. Worth a rental."
1,would be only good if it were independent film,"I would rate 3 stars if it were independent. since they made up all this hype that it was going to be good , I HATED it. why did a major studio buy this few years OLD movie??? it should have stayed independent and maybe only then, would it have been an interesting movie. I cannot believe I paid 12 dollars to watch a movie that was made before 2009??? why oh why???? IT WAS LAMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! and I'm a person who is easily amused"
3,Pretty Lame!,"These movies never meet my expectations. I want them to be good so badly! This one has its moments, but mostly I just can't stand the characters!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I love ghost and other types of scary movies. I like the Blair Witch Project a lot, but this movie has too many flaws and just does not cut the mustard. The main fault is the male character just does not act how a normal human would act and it destroys the illusion of the movie world. The movie is worth a quick rent, but don't expect much."
3,"Overhyped, But It Gets Better As It Goes","I knew before I watched this not to expect much. Once I finally watched it, everything I had heard was pretty much confirmed. This movie was WAY overhyped and so slow through the first half, it's amazing so many people finished watching it. The second half of the movie, when things more noticable start happening and the womans attitude gets worse, the movie becomes more tolerable and even interesting. Just too bad that the second half wasn't the entire movie. It might have made it worth more than a rental."
1,Bedroom Witch Project,"I liked Blair Witch. This was not as good and is kind of a cross between that and The Ring (which I also liked). After the initial plotline is set up, the middle just sags and drags on through."
3,I like this one better than the trilogy,"I liked this version of Activity, but part two was awful. The third part is pretty good too, but the original is the best like all films with sequels and remakes."
1,This movie stunk!,"I heard this was supposed to be scary, So I had to see it. The first thing that came to my mind while watching it was ""Blair Witch Project""! That too was a movie that was hyped up to be ""So Scary"" but stunk! I wanted my money and the time wasted on that movie back!If I could give it negative stars, I would!! Don't waste your money on this movie!"
3,Get this movie for free!,"Sign up for a free VUDU account, and you'll receive 10 free movies (this being one of them). When you link your account to an Xbox, Playstation 3, Roku, Blu-Ray player or HDTV, you'll receive a $5.99 credit to use towards a rental or purchase."
5,Paranormal Activity,"This movie scared me, but I love it, watched it a few times, but it is so scary I dont watch it often. The shipping was fast and the seller wrapped it very good. The movie plays great and to this day it works great, it came in its original casing and the price was great. I recommend this seller and would buy from again."
1,Worst Movie I Ever Saw For All The Hype,"All I've heard about this movie was that it was the scariest movie ever made, so my wife just had to have it. What a waste of money. Scariest movie ever? Are you kidding me? The only scary part was when Kate was dragged out of bed and down the hall. The rest of the movie actually sucked!!! The first half was so boring I almost fell asleep. We kept waiting to be really scared, but it never happened! Wost movie I ever saw. Don't even waste your money renting it. It's that bad !!!"
4,It did the trick for me,"Sure, the boyfriend is a little irritating at times, but if he didn't start obsessively filming everything there'd be nothing to see. Lots of nice, subtle little touches -- things we the viewers see but the characters miss. It builds up and is worth the build-up. Becomes extraordinarily creepy after a while."
1,Junk.,"Even the Chinese ought to be embarassed by this.The plastic that holds the pins melts when you solder the wires to the pins. The parts are held together by the thin, flimsy plastic sleeve. They're not held in the right positions, just together. Temporarily. I'm not using this. I cut it off and tossed it and I'll buy another one from Rean, even if I have to pay the shipping. This isn't worth the cost of returning.Pretty sleazy of Amazon to sell stuff of this quality.John V."
2,Self-Absorbtion,"Typical promiscuous Hollywood Hippie who seeks to satisfy her own desires first and foremost. Peggy dumped her husband Quincy because she was done with the ""marriage thing"" and felt the need to restart her career. Fulfillment, you see. Damage your children, destroy your husband, it's all worth it for Peggy to once more become a stellar star! Peggy, ever hear of the word ""self-sacrifice?"""
2,Has-beens on the comeback,"These has-beens keep trying to make a comeback...but what have they to offer....It's like a TV show that's repeated and repeated and repeated...and has long grown stale...Along with reading some of the book...when I got bored...I skipped numerous parts....and seeing her on Barbara Walter's interview...cooing..I know there's another adventure for me....Get real!....Me and my girlfirends' lives have been every bit as interesting as Ms. Lipton's if not more so..---what attractive normal woman hasn't slept with at least a hundred guys..She must need the money; when every thing else fails, have-beens write a book. It's embarrassing. And the facelift or whatever happened to her...Yuk..."
1,Not what I ordered,"I did not receive the markers I ordered! I ordered the Boone markers pictured, but received Quartet markers- much lower quality; very faint & impossible to see from across the room (actually nearly impossible to see when you're nearby). I'm very disappointed as I really like my old set of Boone markers. I was trying to replace them as the orange marker is finally dying. Don't waste your money on these!"
2,The S5000 is better,I had an S5000 but it dropped it and broke. So I decided to buy this model since I loved the S5000 so much. They took away so many of the great options and quality that the S5000 had...so now I just use a small Fuji pocket digital camera and this one sits on the shelf. It is very blurry in low light and has very little shake control. I would suggest going with the S5000 even with lower Megapixels it is much better quality.
2,Not nearly as good as I expected,I received this camera for my birthday to replace my Sony Mavica (RIP). I really don't care for it. The picture quality is average considering the price and Fuji has still not sent me my $50 rebate ( 12 weeks out...) I'm just not very pleased overall.
4,Good sequel,"The follow on to the Note managed to be different enough but familiar, so as to be an enjoyable film"
3,It's OK,"This sequel, like so many before it, does not live up to the first movie. The story is OK but doesn't have the punch of the first one. It doesn't draw you in like The Note did."
3,No Child Dancers,"This is a perfectly fine performance of the Nutcracker but the choreography is all adult performers. If you are looking for a performance with children in some of the roles (Clara, party scene, Mother Buffoon, etc.) this is not the version you want. The Clara is excellent, however."
4,"If You are Female and over 35, Please Read This Book!","This book explains in layman's terms the hows and whys of female hormones. It provides information that is very much lacking through your ""mainstream"" medical doctor. Keep an open mind and read the entire book. Remember that the advertising industry along with the A.M.A. push women to take synthetic hormones and needless drugs. There are safe, healthy alternatives for women, and this book reveals that to you."
1,The mystery is where are chapters 16-18!!!,"While we are loving the story, tonight we discovered that the book we received is missing 3 of the chapters! What a disappointment! Buyer beware!"
1,Not For This Family,"I knew it was bad when, upon reading this book aloud to my family one Christmas, I looked around to find every last one of them asleep -- and snoring! We'd tried valiantly to give this book a serious go, as it came to us warmly recommended with the instructions to read it aloud each night before Christmas. Not only could we not follow the story, certain elements were downright irritating (dialogue, names) and it presented a mish mash of complicated little plots while at the same time seeming to go nowhere. On about night 5 of this, that's when I found everyone asleep, from my grade school daughter all the way up to my husband. That was certainly the best thing about this book -- the funny memories it gave us from that night. But, alas, we had to abandon ship and read something else much more interesting, entertaining and Christmassy. Sorry!"
4,Good Video,"I like this video and this video series. Though it is VHS, it was in good condition and easy to use."
4,Great buy!,I bought two of these. They are a great shade of denim and have transformed my shabby old sofas. Great too as they are machine washable. Very nice casual and practical look.
2,"no stickey, just oil","To be honest I didn't recieve the stickey product. I recieved solar oil instead of the stickey product. I thought it would be more trouble and hassle to try and return it, so I am stuck with the oil. I did try the oil but I am not to crazy about it. Pam T."
4,Great Little Video Camera,"We are having so much fun with this simple-to-use video camera! For its price, it takes great pics and videos...we haven't even tried the softward provided yet."
3,Vidster Video Camera for 5 year old,"We really thought that our 5 year old would be thrilled with this camera. Turns out that she still wants to use our video camera because it has a bigger, clearer and colored screen. The software was easy to load onto the computer and the camera is easy to use, but it just didn't keep her attention. We will try again in a year to see if it interests her more then."
3,"boring chains, great artist's gallery samples","Some of the chains presented as ""Artist's gallery samples"" are fantastic. Lots of inspirational designs and great techniques. I got several very good ideas for projects.On the other hand, the book's actual project chains are mostly generic and uninteresting. I saw this book befor I bought it, and bought it for the non-project samples. I've seen several of the book's chains made up by friends, and they were not more interesting than they looked in the book.There are tons of free chain instructions available on the internet. It is worth the time to seek them out instead."
2,mostly soldering,I do not solder so this book was not very helpful. If you can solder this book is excellent. I do wirework but with soldering required for most of the chains I have to return the book.
5,Aptly titled gem,"The aspect of this book I most appreciated was the author's theme that handmade chains can be ""lifelong expressions of your soul"". This book emphasizes creative design in silver wire, not repetition of classic chain styles or chainmail weaves. I appreciated the tool suggestions and information on creating a soldering station. In addition,there is a very good discussion of the stick soldering technique in this book. Other reviewers have complained about the projects but I feel they teach skills in a fine progression to allow the beginner to tackle more difficult designs with confidence. After the first project, chains are liberated from requiring standard round links to include a variety of shapes and connections. Each project gives precise lists of necessary supplies, down to the number of inches of silver wire needed. After reading this book I don't think I will be bored by chains ever again."
3,Don't buy it for the rituals.,"For a book called ""Ritual"" the least compelling part of the book were the rituals. While I thought the book was overlong and perhaps a bit too poetic for my taste, what I liked about it was that it made me think about the rituals I was putting together. I was disappointed that Orr's rituals were not very interesting but she did give me a lot to think about, especially in the beginning chapters. I would suggest reading the first few chapters and then stopping before the rituals (which tends to be the opposite thing to do for most magic books!). Not a must-buy but is worth a read."
4,ECSTATIC,WONDERFUL INFO AND TEACHING .A REAL GIFT. The meditations explained clearly and very valuable for me. A must read for every meditator
2,Italian Soup,I make soup every week and was looking for inspiration. I didn't find it in this book. So many recipes are the same- just a different bean used.or some such thing.
5,Good Book from a Great Professor,I guess I am biased because the author of this book taught the class at the University of Central Florida. The course was very thorough and other material/resources were used. As far as another Professor having negative views of the book just reflects his lack of research in the text. A very lazy professor and as a student of his/her class I would be ticked off that I purchased a book he never researched before the start of the semester.
5,Very beautiful voice,I love italian signorita the best.! this music is very nice. She sings beautifully! You can listen to samples before you buy which is why i like shopping on amazon.com
2,This product really stinks really,The Trap N Toss contains a solution that you mix with water and then place in the bottom of the trap. I did not realize that this really stinks so we could not keep it in the house or even just outside the door. It may work great in a barn but not if you have to live with it.
5,This is the best shoe I ever owned.,This is by far the best shoe I ever wore. I'm on my third pair with each of the first lasting no less then three years of constant ware. I will continue to buy this model. It is exceptionally well made and is pretty water resistant. PS all my footwear is by ECCO.
1,Toy in picture is not what is included,"Bought this specifically for the gold thomas, but apparently toy varies then what is pictured. I am sending it back."
2,Video Wrong,"I purchased this after previewing the video on the product page. It also says it is from 2009. Neither of these are true. This video is from 2003 before CGI was used in Thomas and Friends. The video is fine, but not what we were expecting to get and did not hold the attention of my toddlers."
3,Typical Thomas,"The actual Thomas videos are standard fare, but the video extras are not very exciting. There's one sing-a-long, which is ""Winter Wonderland."" Our copy came with a cute frozen Percy and Christmas Caboose.We have found that with the Carlin/Baldwin/Starr (this one is Carlin/Baldwin), our son is not as interested as with the British narrator. Our son (two and a half) is used to watching Thomas on Saturday mornings on PBS. This is our first video. It has taken him a while to get used to the different narrators. Actually, the first few times, he lost interest almost immediately. As he has become used to the different narrator, he's gained interest, but if this is your first entry into the different narrators, just keep this in mind!Overall, I'm just glad to finally have Thomas on demand!"
4,Better than the average femdom material.,"This is an erotica book, not a porn book so if you are looking for lots of measurements, non-stop sex, and vulgar words, don't buy this book. But if you like a hstorical setting, that does appear to be fairly well researched, the imagined ""true story"", with a femdom leaning then you might like this. I found the writing top notch and the plot well thought out -- however, only three or so months seemed to be covered in what was a three year relationship in much detail. And I want to know why all these femdom tales have sad endings, where the man returns to his world and spends the rest of his life yearning for the powerful female or she dies or she is brought around to the reality that she just needs a strong man. At least this was a romantic tale by the end and for that and the research I give it four stars."
3,Could use some instructions,"Looks great and works just like it's suppose to but I had some trouble trying to figure out how to install it, Kind've just guessed as I went but eventually got it right."
1,Do not purchase this book under any circumstances,"There are massive errors within the text of this book and not the ""scanning"" errors described above; it cannot display accent marked letters, swaps numbers for random letters, places chapter headings in body text, and many other issues. Much of the book is in French terminology of cooking and these coding errors make it useless for the purposes of learning the recipes and methods described. I have sent request to amazon for a fix or a refund, as I have been sold a broken product."
4,it does work,"The steth does work if you realize you have to turn the head on it around til it clicks. The drum wont amplify sound very well until you do, then it works great. I bought it just to have around the house and I'm pleased with its result. Had to assemble it myself out of the box, took me about 2 minutes total time from opening it to using it. I'm satisfied with the quality for the price. Once you get it, spin the drum head around a few times and you'll see that it does in fact work fine."
4,good staff,"It's pretty good staff according to its price, I used it routinely and personally, it's light and easy to use."
4,frugal shopper,This is a good place to get these kind of supplies. They have good prices and ship fast.i was suprised when i received my stuff it was just what i expected
2,A Scope of a Different Color,"I was excited when my stethoscope arrived! I mean really, look at that color! Well when I pulled it out of the package I was SO disappointed. The color of the scope is NO WHERE NEAR the color in the picture. It is actually an ugly dark blue. I turned the switch to make it work and only one of the ear pieces works - LAME. Returning for an exchange since I purchased it with an Amazon gift card..."
2,Nice toy.,"I was told to purchase a ""cheap"" steth for my CNA class. So I did. Somehow, I don't think they meant- ""this cheap"".... Bought another one... There is a combo pack, prestige steth/blood pressure cuff for around $26 or an Omron steth, that you can pick up for about $10.Worth 2 stars, though, because my kids love it. But, unless you intend to buy a child's toy, I would pass on this."
3,Good for kids,I bought this for a handicapped child that stays in a Nursing Home where I was at recently for rehab. The nurses there would always let him listen to his heartbeat with their stethoscope's and he got a big kick out of it so I bought him this for Christmas. It's nothing compared to the ones the nurses use but at least you can hear your heartbeat though it is faint compared to the nurses. Alright for listening to your own heart to see if your still alive but would not recommend for a professional.
3,Man in Tow,"I only read the second & third stories. I skipped the first story by Karen Rose as I was not keen to read her works.Annie Solomon - 1 star. Annie Solomon has written some stellar works and I have read two of them. But this short story fell very short of her trademark let me shock you crime stories. Its simply a story about a girl having a crush on an undercover detective who betrayed her family a couple of years ago. The dialogue & action were dull and rather tepid. In short, a disappointment.Carla Cassidy - 5 stars. Carla did a fantastic job with the short story. The strong mystery pull was there in the form of a blind date who took the protagonist lady character on a whirlwind car chase that kept getting out of control as the story progresses. Carla tends to portray domesticated women who may seem rather docile on first impression but turn out to have intelligence & strength of character. Great read."
3,"A not-bad book, but overly simple","Soul Calibur is the hottest fighting game on the market today, and it's also one of the hardest to master. You need a strategy guide! Fortunately, the ubiquitous Prima guides are out and about, and they've released one for Soul Calibur.As far as guides go, it's not bad. There are many pictures, and all of the moves are displayed, but the emphasis here seems to be on style over substance. The book is pretty to look at, sure, but the strategies sound like they are coming from an amateur and, quite frankly, could have been better. Sure, they're great for players just starting the game, but experts want more. Overall, though, a worthy purchase for improving your game."
3,MAXX FACTOR,"I hadn't read MAXION 1, so I was a little lost when I picked this one up, but ultimately my brief confusion didn't really matter.MAXION 2 has enough action, explosions and busty babes in it that I just plowed right ahead. This is a pretty fast-paced volume with an extended fight scene in which the heroine's clothes are reduced to shreds when she uses her explosive telekinetic powers...OOOPS!Things calm down a bit once our heroes return home to Japan, and it's mostly set-up for the next series of erotic adventures which feature a busty new professor who takes a shine to our lead character.All in all, MAXION is light-hearted and fun, with plenty of hot chicks to keep you turning the pages."
4,A Solid Product,"The only beef I have with this cable is the one I have will all PS/2 extension cables - the ends become separated too easily. Other than that it's a great product, certainly as good as or better than its competitors."
3,I like the side with the stripes but...,"The side of the shoe with the stripes looks killer, but the other side looks rather undone, and kind of cheap (there are no stripes, reminds me of the LA Looks shoes from 1989....)"
1,Terrible Craftsmanship,"The shorts are comfortable, but when I work out, I want a tight fit. The second time I ever tried to tie the drawstring, it broke from the seams. I wasn't using an overt amount of strength to tie them together, yet it popped apart like it was made to do it. I guess I get what I pay for, nothing more, nothing less."
4,Good Value Easy to Wear,"I bought these shorts for my husband and couldn't be happier. It is always challenging to find shorts that fit him being a bit of a bigger guy and these really do fit comfortably and wear well. Most of his shorts end up getting distorted because he carries so much in his pockets and wears them non-stop, but these hold up well. He really likes the way they fit and wears them to do everything from jogging to mowing the grass."
2,EDIT: After extended use,"I needed a pair of workout shorts with pockets, found these on Amazon, bought 3 pairs, and have no regrets. They breathe well are just the right length (right above the knee). Really an all around nice pair of shorts at a decent price.EDIT:After using these shorts for a few months one terrible thing I realized is that they hold smell tremendously!! I am not the kind of person that sweats and/or stinks a lot after a workout but the shorts have collected a stench that is just awful and washing does not remove the smell. If I used an athletic detergent I'm sure I could get the smell removed but that really shouldn't be a must for shorts. I would highly recommend finding something with a different material."
5,Great Shorts,"These shorts are great for the price - they are the perfect length, and they have pockets as well. According to the size chart, i was supposed to be a medium, but i had to go a size up because they were tight around my nuts."
4,Good shorts for the price.,Can't really beat the price on these. Material is really light but quality is still there. Pockets seem to hang a little too low when you have a few things in them (wallet and phone).
2,cheap,"cheap feeling shorts with drawstrings that break very easily.the shorts are also very loose, so order a size smaller than you normally would"
5,nice shorts,"I bought these shorts to use at the gymn when I work out, and they seem to very comfy and good for excercising in."
4,Not Bad,"Decent quality especially for the price. A little long for what I like them for (running) but that is clear on the photo. One noticeable con is the length (and depth, I guess) of the pockets. They are oddly all the way down to the end of the shorts."
3,good for the price,"when you wear it you will feel it's not that good , but it's good for the price. I personally don't like it very much but I can say , Overall it's okay"
5,"Bottom line: Great Price, Great Comfort","I've bought Champion brand before and have been satisfied, this isn't any different. Light weight, breathable, comfortable fit and feel. If you carry somewhat heavy things in your pockets then you'll need to use the draw string, I carried a full 20oz bottle of water in mine (and no it didn't hang out of the shorts like someone else complained about). Pockets are perfect length, about 4 inches from the bottom hem on each leg, and a little bigger than I expected which is nice. For reference I'm 5'10"" and 230 lbs and ordered Black, Large, and they fit perfect. I plan on ordering 2 more pairs, thanks!Bottom line: Great Price, Great ComfortOn a side note, I wear these for my job that requires a lot of walking, 10 hour shifts 5 days a week."
1,Hazard,"This product is a camping hazard. It is made of glass. Mine broke into many, many pieces creating a health hazard for an entire 19 day wilderness trip."
4,A fine contemporary R&B album from The Dramatics.,"Although plagued by many of the excesses which typified most post-1986 R&B, I found the ""Stone Cold"" CD quite satisfying--especially when compared to the ""music"" being put out by most major labels at the time. ""Let's Make Love 4-ever"" is a great tune that shows how hard The Dramatics tried to keep their sound contemporary. Not as powerful as their classic Stax releases but still a nice CD that could have done better."
3,Noisy,"I read a review that trashed Jive for chopping this album. I see Why now I have tryed to make this thing sound better, but it still sound bad. Hey ,but it is UGK so."
3,read koran,is this book written by muslim nowestern writers do not know islamlies told upon islam everywhere in bookswe do not murder jihad only in defense of islam onlyread koran and not this bookwe work like you and loveread koran please for truth
4,Just about anything Sandy did is worth having,"Sandy Denny had one of the finest voices in music. The recent reissue program that includes the solo albums, the Fairport Convention albums and the two Fotheringay projects will certainly provide most fans with enough top-notch material. But, if you are inspired to dig deeper, you'll want the box sets AND this album. ""Where the Time Goes"" fills in a few gaps from Sandy's early projects and provides more proof that she was among the best in Pop, Rock, Folk; anything she tried."
3,Reader from the south-east US,"HiI'd be interested to know which typos, grammar errors and careless proofreading you found in Queens' Jewels."
2,A real oddball,Three episodes are stitched together with the common theme of hypodermic needles. This is not for the squeamish. The first tale concerns tainted blood. The second one is about AIDS. And I couldn't finish watching the third. Don't see if you don't like the sight of needles sticking into peoples' bodies. I'll give them credit for making something pretty creative here. I just didn't find it too compelling. The middle yarn about a mother who gives herself AIDS to die with her son is the best of the bunch.
4,Better Than Clearsil or Proactiv in my mind,"The only thing that has worked for me in the last three years. I switched to a cream-based Clearsil with the same strength of benzoyl peroxide (the store was out of this type), and it made my skin drier AND didn't work. I think the quality of face soap solely depends on the skin type. This Oxy works miracles for my skin type."
5,Spectacular reinvention of the tale of Athena,"Falling more into the realm of a well-plotted fantasy novel than the ""historical romance"" category that it lists on its cover, ""All's Fair in Love and War"" is a wonderful reimagining of many of the myths of Athena and other Greek figures. It blends a human-based reinterpretation of various Greek myths (including Medusa and Arachne) with a bit of the magic from whence they came. Though not a classic romance novel (and certainly not a historical romance by the way of others in the genre), this book is heart-warming and thought-provoking, altogether one of the best books I have ever read."
3,Not bad.,I kept wondering how long it would take Savage to find out Tony was a woman. It certainly took him long enough when all the facts were staring him in the face. It was not a bad book overall.
5,Just Lovely,"Whimsical, humorous, romantic, and lusty! Seduced should be the template for all romance novels. I truly enjoyed this one."
5,Well kiss my aspidistra. . . this is a good book,"Not only is this book sexy and interesting but funny to boot. I really love the supporting characters they offer so much comedic releif. I always find myself laughing out loud whenever I read it (wich is quite often.) After rereading it, for what I think is the 5th time, I came to the conclusion that this novel is tied for all time favorite with the Pirate and the Pagan (another wonderful book) I never want to put this book down when I read it. However, all good things must come to an end.Anyway, buy this book no matter what other horrible reviews you read. I swear on my life Adam and Antonia are worth the wait!!"
4,Definitely Worth Buying,"Although Wolfgang Puck has become one of America's best known chefs, I have not been overlly impressed with either his restaurants, nor his prior cookbooks. This cookbook was in fact for me, a very nice surprise. Mr Puck shares with us his secrets for his famous pizza and pasta recipes, and every recipe I have tried from this book so far has been great. One favorite is his Savory Squash Soup, and another his Herbed Artichoke Pizza. The recipes are easy enough for a novice cook to follow, and the food photos are truly inspiring. It is difficult not to run to the kitchen after browsing through this book. This cookbook has definitely given me a more favorable opinion of Mr. Puck."
1,Total POS,This thing simply doesn't work well. D-Link is right up there with Linksys in my book of absolutely worthless wireless networking equipment providers.
5,Home Staging 101,"Lise has hit a home run with her new DVD on Home Staging. Its the perfect marketing tool to help both Realtor and Home Owner understand the value of the home staging service. Filled with facts and great tips, this DVD answers every question the Seller might have on ""Why Stage."" I recommend it highly and hope to use the ""Why Stage"" portion to help educate the Realtor market I work with. Congratulations, Lise! This is a winner.Jannis VannInnovations in StagingWoodstock,GA"
2,Not Impressive,This book is strictly for beginners. I already knew most of the information before I read the Book. I was hoping this book would give be an advanced understanding of Windows Xp. It hasn't. It wasn't worth 30 bucks.
4,Best Rack I've ever purchased for home use.,"I have purchased many racks over the years from Bed Bath & Beyond, Target and online vendors.This rack is extremely sturdy and I love the fold away feature. I'm certain I'll purchase another one when I purchase my new home for extra hanging space for company because I'm currently using it in my laundry room."
5,Just what I needed!,This clothing rack is perfect. The last two I bought started leaning right after i put my clothes on them. This one is really sturdy and looks presentable. A nice metal shine and also easy to move around. I would totes recommend this to a friend.
4,A Modern take,"This book is about the spirit and ideas of Dante and not the literal text. I think the references to modern people and concepts make it more accessible to new readers. The drawings are a fun take on Dore. If you are looking for a literal translation, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a well written and thought out interpretation of Dante, I can recommend this book. I have read many translations of the Inferno but few that I have enjoyed as much. I look forward to Birk and Sanders' Purgatorio and Paradiso."
3,Helpful,"I've been taking a rather in depth study of Dante's Divine Comedy given in 6 semesters and just completed my 5th and next spring I will finish the entire series. I started with Purgatory and then Paradise. I have two other study books to go with the first translation I bought through Amazon and only wish that all three sections were done in such a light fashion as this book. Little raw in the language but it has been helpful. But you really need to read a better translation to get Dante's genious of writing the comedy that pops up everywhere, even hundreds of years later."
3,Product is OK,This would be a good product for new Catholics. For existing Catholics it is somewhat tedious. I would be nice to be able to get Roman Catholic Catechism on CD.
4,Catechism for Adults Review,This is a good explanation of the content of the official Catholic Catechism for a self-study program. Plenty of cited examples are used as to reference the outlined materials included within the official document. The end of each chapter offers questions for group discussion or personal reflection. The meditation included at the end of each chapter is also a tremendous aid in understanding the subject.I had no expectations as to what would be included. My purchase was made by a personal inquiry to address the faith to another individual. I was looking to prepare myself properly for that endeavor. I would recommend this book to anyone studying the Catholic faith.
4,A good book for reference.,"This is an excellent book but it is begging for something to go with it. That something is a newer copy of the New American Bible, Revised version of the Bible and a copy of the Vatican II documents. All these documents get to the bottom of what we believe. They form the foundation for our religious library.Deacon Pat"
4,Adults need Catechism too!,"We are using this book for our Adult Catechism class. Since most of the classes are an hour, I suggest that you don't just read it in class. It really is more important to get what you can from this book and not just rush through it. If you read it in class, only read part and then discuss what you have read. It can get quite deep and complicated. It is a wonderful part of the experience to share with others and in turn reap the benefits of enlightenment."
5,Better than the First - for a Change!,"It's rare when a sequel outdoes its original, but with Steve Alten's ""The Trench,"" he proves it can get better the second time around. This is a much more inventive and exciting story than the first book, ""Meg."" We get to know the characters a lot better around this time, and Alten has given us two really despicable villains - Benedict Singer and the absolutely sociopathic Celeste. There are so many times in the book I want to punch her lights out, that it gets to be real fun just waiting to find out how she will get her demise! And she does. Jonas is a human character with fears and flaws, and he carries the book nicely. All in all, it's a refreshingly entertaining book and hard to put down in one sitting!Michael Butts"
4,A good sequel to MEG,"Meg is back in this sequel, which picks up right where the last novel left off. Angel, the female offspring of the Meg, is being held in captivity and displayed by Jonas Taylor and aquarium-owner Masao Tanaka. What many don't realize is that Angel is smart and thus escapes her captivity. Again the horror starts with Angel rampaging everything in her path. Now, Jonas must go back to the Marianas Trench and try to eliminate this prehistoric giant, but once there he finds that there are other prehistoric monsters still alive. Not as good as MEG, but full of action, horror and lots of fun to read."
5,A Nail-biter of a book,"This was a fun book to read. I am a huge fan of ocean stories and ocean fiction, and the idea of a megalodon shark showing up just sounded like more fun than a Jaws marathon. Steve Alten does not disappoint. (How did this guy slip under my radar for so long?) Unfortunately, despite the fact that my 9-year old also loves shark fiction, he will have to wait a few years to read this book - there is also more than a ""hint"" of sex. It's fairly explicit in some scenes. (If you are reading this, Steve, I need a G-rated copy for my son.) All in all a really great book!"
4,the trench,I feel that the book is full of suspense. I also feel that the side plot about Terry Taylor was equally as suspensefull. I really would like to see this book as a movie. Could you let the meg lovers of the world know if this becomes a plan to make one?
3,The Trouble with Two's,"I was so taken with Steve Alten's ""Meg"", even though he annoyed me by writing one of the recent books I wished I had, that I was so desperate to obtain his latest that I even paid for the express delivery price despite the high price of the pound. I took it to bed and read it straight through which is a mark of the sheer story-telling power of this latest; a real page-turner, must- know what next. I am very fond of Megs and wish there had been more about his heroine, which she obviously is, but why it was only a 3 this time round was that the central plot was too similar ""Boy meets fish, boy loses fish, etc."" The subplot will be interesting to those who do not know of undersea mining and the cover up of Howard Hughes and the ""Glomar Explorer "". All in all, it is well worth the read and the ending leaves it open, hopefully, for more to come. I for one have logged it for advance information."
4,More than fantastic.,The trench was just as exciting as Meg. It really kept you on edge and constantly thinking to where you couldn't put the book down. Steve Alten has yet to disappoint me with his clever twist and turns in the meg series. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun and generally fast read.
5,The Trench,"I loved The Trench. I thought it wouldn't be as good as Meg but I thought that both works were wonderful! Thank you Steve Alten for writting two wonderful, suspenseful novel."
1,Dreadful,"This is a cartoon of a book...wait, that's an insult to cartoons. It's contrived and badly written, and should give hope to aspiring writers everywhere, that if this can make it into print, then so can they."
4,Steve's next best,"Angel is back but there is more to the story then just that. I was excited to read this book by Steve and was happy with the results. I recommend this to any fan of Steve's or ""Jaws"" type fan."
5,Love to see a movie from the book,"I loved the book!! It took me awhile to read because I have two small children, but once I started I couldn't put it down. I love sharks, especially great whites and when I saw your book in the store I had to get it. I had only heard about the megladon just recently on the discovery channel. They had found a tooth. I would love to see the book be turned into a movie!! I think it would be a hit! I read you were waiting for the right script, but I think it should be taken straight out of the book word for word. I mean if the book was a great hit then if you took the movie straight from that why wouldn't the movie be a hit? You have a great talent, keep on writing!!"
3,A reasonable study of the British navy,"Its a repeat of his earlier theories instead here he links British economics to its naval history. It makes sense as much more then land powers, a naval force depends on technology and economics.Overall this book is a fair study of the British navy from the period of 1600 to modern times."
5,LOVED IT!!,"I must say that CASTLE FREAK is a very good horror movie. The FREAK is definately a FREAK and the box does his pretty face justice. It is a very creepy movie and has some shocking parts that you really wouldn't expect. The acting was pretty good for the type of movie and the man who plays the FREAK did a fantastic job bringing the FREAK to life, the way he walked and the fact that he ran around with his nasty naked body showing through most of the movie only added to the horror and disgust. I loved this movie and would say that if you enjoy horror then you will probably love this movie to. Add it to your collection it is worth the money."
3,This is the sort of movie you have to get into to enjoy.,"I truly enjoy Full Moon movies because they are all B-Movies, no matter how much they try to make them good. But I will have to say for this one that you have to have patience. I say that because it is a well done movie, but the speed at which it goes combined with the quality of film and the lighting of the movie make it drag out. But after several viewings, if you look at it with an un-biased view against bad movies you will enjoy it.The story line is pretty good, and I think all you b-movie lovers will enjoy it. If you watch it again after the first time. (Shamefull as it is too admit, I fell asleep the first time.)"
2,WHIP ME BEAT ME HURT ME,"Ten minutes into the film I was bored with the formulaic writing. Monster child chained in castle. Owner dies. New owner comes in with a blind daughter. Monster child takes a shine to the blind daughter, although the ""Beauty and the Beast"" aspect doesn't blossom. Toss in a few sidetracks and you have a very boring film. I prefer the American version of this type of film.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, sex, nudity. Available on an 8 pack of Horror films at Wal-Mart for $5.00"
1,What what what???!!!,"I have to wonder what world, what physical plane, what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on? Or maybe they are Full Moon employees LOL...First of all, the movie, especially one of the earlier scenes, was identical to the 80's flick ""The Unnamable"", which is also and HP Lovecraft based flick. The castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit. When he breaks out his cell, well this was just hilarious, it reminded me of the incredible hulk. Yes, Jeffrey Combs is in it. But his acting is cheesy as it can be. Hunt down The Unnamable instead, a much better movie."
4,A basic acoustic introduction,This book is easy to read with many practical examples described in simple basic acoustical or structural terms. It is a very good place to start for those who are just beginning but for those with experience or previous training it offers little technical or detailed information nor acoustical equations. As a basic overview it is fine and the resource section is very useful.
1,"Boxers are for old men, get a thong instead",My girlfriends and I call Boxers Grandpa pants. My grandfather used them. Men in boxers look awful and geeky.Thongs are the new fashion and women love to see their man in a thong. (specially fit young women)Also think about this: it is a medical fact that your intimate parts will stretch and hang if not properly supported.
2,"Lots of 2D detailing, little 3D anatomy, too much Poser.","I would have to say that I am quite disappointed in what this book has to offer. I had hoped to see more tutorials on how to ""perfect"" a 3D female form, or human form in general, using applications like: Lightwave, Max, Maya and Softimage etc. with a heavy focus on anatomy. Instead, the bulk on this book is filled with Photoshop detailing techniques used to create a single STILL!!! image/scene and a gallery with many images that were obviously done in Poser and not very original. There are, in my opinion, better 3D anatomy tutorials around the web than in this book if you are interested in perfecting the art of building a realistic human figure. Thank god it wasn't expensive."
3,"Great picture book, short on rhymes","I had a Mother Goose book when I was young and remember my mom reading it to me all the time, so when my sister gave this book to me as a gift for my infant daughter, I was very excited to share it with her. If you are looking for a picture book, this is for you. The illustrations are great and even though my daughter is only 5 months old, she seems to enjoy looking at the pictures in the book. The nursery rhymes are lacking, however. Some of the nursery rhymes are shortened while some of the ""classics"" are not included (Old Mother Hubbard, Simple Simon, This Is The House That Jack Built, London Bridge, Georgie Porgie, The Queen of Hearts, Sing A Song of Sixpence, Starlight Starbright, This Little Piggy, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, etc...)Great to look at, subpar for reading."
2,A few good ideas... but an overall bad book,"This book offers nothing that other ""millionaire guide"" books don't. Anybody who is familiar with this somewhat unconventional genre, can tell that Colt's book is among the worst of the lot.The book is simply written badly - from grammer to layout to the logical flow of the text. The book does discuss many important concepts (such as the importance of ""Dream Time"" or planning), but there are countless better books which discuss the same ideas.2 stars for getting the basic ideas right. If Colt wants more then that, he'll have to actually learn how to write..."
1,The Worst,"this is the worst book i have ever read!do not buy it.this guy is a phony,the book is full of simplistic nonsence.(if you want to be a millionare,buy something for a million dollars and sell it for 2 million.it really says this!) it also says issue a million shares of stock,sell one share for a dollar,now you are a millionare.this guy should be arrested.it is also full of typos and gramatical errors.a worthless waste of time.(i give it zero stars,but one is the minimum amazon allows.)"
2,A Concept Straight Out Of Earl Nightinglae,"If anyone heard Earl Nightingale's...The Strangest secret, they will know that it was his original idea.I own an online marketing business and I see this deception all the time. Poor the man who spends $15 thinking he will be a millionaire in a year.The author may have meant well, but the title is purely a ploy into making sales.Chris"
5,Im optimistic,I read this book and I thought that the different ideas presented here had some merit. I look forward to using them.
3,Item Pictured is NOT the Item Received,These picks were purchased for my daughter and the item picture lead me to believe that I would get 'girly' colors but instead ended up with a 12-pack of brownish-colored picks. I have no doubt that the picks are high quality and will be good for playing but please be warned that you are not getting a multi-pack here and the item description does NOT give any hint of this.
1,this is not the dc version!,Stay away from this game! It is not the same beautiful fun game that came out on the Dreamcast. It suffers from a bloched rush job syndrome. The beautiful graphics are now gone. The really cool looking spell animations are also missing from this version. Also slowdown is a majior problem. Get this for DC.
5,Get any other mp3 player and you will regret it,"I bought mine a little less than a year ago and it has been great since day one. It is compact, can be used as an emergency startup disk for Macintosh computers, and the controls makes navigation a piece of cake. I also have a Nomad Jukebox and a friend at work has the Archos Jukebox...I can't believe how archaic those things are, if you want to navigate to a certain song it will take you minutes. WIth my iPod and the scroll wheel, it takes no time to find what you want. The sound is crystal, the battery usage is amazing, it still cranks out 8-10 hours after all this time. My biggest gripe was that there were no battery replacements offered, but now for $ you can get a new battery...so all in all I have yet to find a flaw on this puppy. The firewire transfer of songs is simply mindblowing. Buy any other mp3 player and you will regret it even more now that you have just read this :)"
2,Another serving of cold hash that just doesn't feed the mind,"Even vampires know when something has turned from meal to corpse, for Stanley it seems the sucking won't stop even if the meal has turned to ash. The Millionaire Next Door was the best by this author, but stealing a page from Hollywood the sequels just don't measure up to the ""promise"". Kudos for the author for trying to extend his oil well even though it is a dry well."
1,Total and complete waste of money,"Here's the bottom line... There are no secrets to marketing to the affluent, they are used to people begging them for money, don't waste your time. Unless you're planning on joining the country clubs that they belong to and networking, you don't have a prayer. Just remember, Walmart is the largest corporation in the world and they don't sell to the affluent. There's an old adage in sales that says ""sell to the classes, live with the masses. Sell to the masses, be among the classes."" You make a lot more money prospecting 10 moderate clients than looking for one whale."
2,"Here's to you Brett, Editor, Publisher, Everyman, Today . .","I know Brett so I will choose my words very carefully here . The bottom line, and he already knows this, is that I didnt like it. So sue me. I found it . . .well the idea behind the book is a good one, but other than that, I will say no more. FOr me to sit here an anatomize all that I didnt like about it would not be nice to my friend. I will say, if you are interested in this book, check it out at the local library of flip through it first before purchasing it."
5,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would be more outdoors type like ""Into the Wild"". I was pleasantly surprised to find it was much more similar to ""The Alchemist"". I though it was great and read straight though in one sitting. If you'd like a fresh perspective on life I recommend this book."
2,Highly Unmemorable...,"Irish comic O'Hanlon has written a largely unmemorable coming of age novel starring the entirely unsympathetic and creepy 18-year-old Patrick. He works as a security guard in Dublin and periodically takes the bus to his home hamlet on weekends, allowing the reader a glimpse into both city and small town life in early 80s Ireland. While certain set pieces and milieus are descriptively evoked, the overall story of the ethically confused boy and his relationship with college student Francesca doesn't really hold together. The novel is more effective when it breaks off into excerpts from Franceca's diary, detailing her side of their relationship. However, this too, is problematic, as you know that eventually Patrick will be reading it, and only bad things can result. All in all, it lacks the humor I had expected, and is very bleak. Elements of it are highly reminiscent of The Butcher Boy."
5,Does what it needs to! Easy to Refill,Love it!!! It's heavy enough to stay put when you're pulling post-it's out. Very understated sleek design. Very easy to refill. What more could you ask for!
4,the crimes of love . very good book,read the book in highschool after i watched the movie quills. very good book actually very entertaining .
5,Excellent product,"I got my new (used) fob and had it programmed and working within 5 minutes of opening the package. I'm very pleased with the detailed, easy to follow instructions that came with the fob. The fob itself, though used, shows very little signs of previous use. Excellent product."
1,Made cheap,This light set is made very cheaply. I had to solder the main headlight center post where they forgot to. It is made from cheap plastic and very hard to open to put the batteries in.Not worth the money.
1,Don't bother,"The lights seem to perform well, but the plastic housing and brackets used for attachment to the bike are very cheap. The L-shaped bracket which articulates the rear tail light up and down has broken...even before I rode with it. The wind blew my bike over, and the entire impact was absorbed by the handle bar, seat, & pedal. The tail light escaped direct impact with the ground, but the bracket still broke. The batteries were not even installed, which would make it break even easier with greater mass! Choose a more robust bike light!!"
4,"An entertaining, good book","Even though I do not share Carolina's passion for locomotives or math and Latin, I found this book to be very interesting and informative. I had just been reading about Andrew Jackson in my history book, so that made the historical aspect of ""Distant Dreams"" more interesting to me. I liked the suspense in the first two books. (I'm still reading the third book.) It was hard to put down once I got into the book, which didn't take long."
5,"A well researched, insightful book","At first I dismissed this book based on several reviews I had seen that seemed to elude to a poorly compiled, misleading story. It is not that at all.While this book does discuss Skorzeny's role in the Gran Sasso raid, it takes a well researched view of the variety of players involved in the decision, planning and execution of Operation Oak from the times just before Mussolini's downfall up to the end of the war. I found this book to be well researched, with plenty of facts, insights and details presented. I thought the writing style was very comfortable, especially given the sensitivity of World War 2 writing and the shear volume of facts (and speculation) involved.I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those interested in this famous raid, Fallschirmjagers, Skorzeny, War on the Italian Front, late war politics, and those who like a good factual, adventure story!"
1,a suckers book,"this book was to aid me in getting my wifes immigration papers done. it only covered one form in that area. there are about 8 forms to deal with. I can not recomend this book to anyone, need help get a immigration lawyer. lol, the one form in book i needed, i didn't need help with, so for me this book was a 100 % loss of my money."
1,Revolting,"Parents beware! This message of fear of the unknown can be given in infinitely better ways. The writing style is for a very young child. However, before you find out the main character is having a dream, children in his class have been beheaded, half eaten, turned to ashes, entirely eaten and ""is digesting"", or had a head shrunk to the size of a pin (picture given of small head on girl's body). At naptime the teacher says ""Everyone who still has one, put your head on your desk.""I do not find this flight of fantasy amusing. Where, one might wonder, did this boy become exposed to such violent images? This book is more likely to create new fears for your children, than to calm their fears.I also reacted a little to the teacher ending up as a blond with, if not blue eyes (they are just black dots), then blue eye shadow.Violence and stereotyping. Worst children's book I have read in a long time."
5,I have been searching for this for years!!!!!,I had the album years ago and literally wore it out. Tried for a while to find it again with no luck. I was THRILLED when I saw it today. One of the MOST ROMANTIC recordings ever!
2,Not up to OXO standards,The bowl is too small and will only chop very small amounts at a time ( 1/4 onion etc.)Not what I was expecting.
3,Not as great as we expected,"We got this as a gift and had seen many ads for these type of chopper type contraptions. I feel like you have to cut your veggies into smaller pieces before being able to use this effectively, because large chunks will get stuck in between the blade and then it gets stuck. We made salsa with it, which worked out ok, since it basically juiced the tomato in the process so the pico de gallo was a nice consistency. Chopping the onion and peppers was a little more difficult. An onion is basically already individual layers, but this chopper kept getting jammed with onions in between the blade. And any long strand that got caught in the corner just didnt get chopped. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be able to chop any carrots, so I'd probably still end up dicing some things by hand. Maybe because this is an imitation of the slap chop on tv, so it doesn't work as well? The guy in that ad makes it look so easy. The concept of this is good, but I wished it worked better."
4,Great belts... but may not be the belt you need.,"Gatorbacks are excellent belts; however this belt in particular may not be the belt you need if you have a GM 3.8 Supercharged engine. This is the accessory belt, not the supercharger belt. I ordered this one and when we went to put it on realized my supercharger belt is Gatorback #4060663. Gatorbacks are awesome belts and worth the extra couple bucks, but I would recommend buying both the #4060905 and #4060663... when you go to replace one just replace both. Please keep in mind I am speaking of the 3.8 supercharged, if you have another motor which uses #4060905 you may not need a second belt."
2,dollar store quality.,"The Progressive Housewares GT-3091 cheese slicer looked good on line and in the package. It's rounded metal on the top and hollow on the bottom. The guide and wire weren't parallel and couldn't be aligned. Adjustment, tensioning of the wire is done with a simple set screw, pull it tight with pliers, wrap around the screw and tighten. The guide adjustment is clumsy at best. It's what you expect to find at the dollar store. I returned this item."
3,Decent,"This item is only of ""okay"" quality - as other reviewers have mentioned, the setups for adjusting the slice thickness and wire tension don't work too well.But... the thing is only 10 bucks (currently on sale for 5) and at that price I think it's a good value. If I'd paid the ""list price"" of $75.00, I would not be a happy camper!"
1,Progressive Cheese Slicer,"Critical piece missing...unusable as received.The ""set screw"", which also holds the two halves of this item together was missing.Nothing I have will fit it. Looking for an RMA."
4,Excellent coverage of strategy,"Elk Tactics provides a verbally, but not pictorally graphic discussion of Elk hunting strategy. The authors focus on strategy and gloss over discussions of gear. You can find many references on gear and nobody agrees anyway so this is not a serious shortcomming of the work. I found the section on where to hunt very useful as a starting point for some serious pre-season scouting and map work. The descriptions of elk habitat and how to hunt it was very clear and logical. You will need more than this book to get the full spectrum of all that you need to know, but at the modest price it is highly recommended. I appreciated the author's contribution to the field of elk hunting literature and am confident that you will also."
4,Ripping Yarns!,Peter Hopkirk relates the story of archaeological plunder in Central Asia with skill and verve. Great stuff for those who enjoy adventure stories.
5,Cause for Alarm is just as good...,"This is a hardcore classic that any fan of hardcore has toown. There are no two ways about it this album is brilliant. The chronlogy on this album is reversed starting with 'Cause for alarm' which came AFTER 'Victim in Pain'. A lot of people for some reason are not too king about Cause... This is a great album which kick started the crossover and later the metalcore genre. It has speed-metal drums, with S.O.D./M.O.D. Carnivore, style double kick drums. Admittedly Roger Miret's vocals aren't the greatest on this album but the music more than makes up for it. Tracks 11-21 are 'victim in Pain' which has been rightly hailed as an all-time classic though personally I prefer the 'United Blood' EP. This is a good package of two classic albums which hardcore fans should be picking up. Buy it now."
5,amazing,The images floor me. If a picture is worth a thousand words.... then this collection speaks incalculable volumes.
5,Lined Post-its; great thinking!,"The Post-it version of a lined index card. My son's English teacher requires them to use sticky notes for various reading assignments. His handwriting is tough to read at best. The lined notes are a great tool for him. Recommended, especially for a child."
1,Unsatisfied,This product did not work at all. I have used other products that were cheaper that gave my hair some body and actually minimized the thinning hair. This gave me no body and did not work adequately.
1,"cabello pegajoso, imposible de manejar",El producto me pareció horrible. Trate de usarlo varias veces. Definitivamente malo. Hay otros productos en el mercado que cumplen mucho mejor esta función sin arruinar el efecto final.
2,Head Full of Grease,"I was so hopeful about this product. I tried it both on dry and wet hair, and either way, it just made my hair feel greasy. By the end of the day I looked like I hadn't washed my hair all week. I used varying amounts, pea to nickel-sized. Didn't matter. I give it 2 stars because it did make hair feel fuller (which is weird, since greasy hair is usually flat). I have very fine hair, and an oily scalp that needs to be washed daily. This just didn't work for my chemistry."
2,meh- don't bother,this product is like a gel it really doesn't do much for my hair i read some good reviews of it however it might not be for everybody so I am giving this a no I would not purchase again however the shipping was on point
3,More specific than it seems.,"I found the cover blurb of this book a little misleading. Chapters do end with bullet point style summaries, but this is not a book I'd recommend for anyone who isn't already familiar with the dabates it engages with - not an introductory text, in other words.Campbell's project is quite specific - she re-reads spectatorship theory, psychoanalytic film theory, and so on through her concept of ""phenomenological mimesis"". This is, in effect, a phenomenology which centres on the film text rather than the embodied spectator, and Campbell retains a strong investment in psychoanalytic theory with her concept of the spectator as bound up in hysterical mimesis. Her approach is an interesting one."
3,For the price...not very durable,"For the amount of money paid, the product was not very durable. Especially the armour pieces. These were easily torn when undoing the velcro strips. We ended up having two of these tear before the costume was even worn."
3,Pricey for what it does...,"Tool is quite expensive for what it does. In addition, like the other reviewer said, it was about 1 or 2mm too big! That really sucks... Now I have to improvise on a tool that should have done it's job correctly. Instead of adding the pin to the other side, WHY NOT ANOTHER HOLE? LIKE...34mm HOLE??? SOMETIMES...I think they (Park company) are confused..."
5,Awesome,I bought this for my brother who has been an aggressive lifter for 10 years and who provides me with amazing weight-lifting advice. He loved the book.
5,An impressively annotated translation,"The collaborative academic effort of Christopher M. McDonough, Richard E. Prior and Mark Stansbury, Servius' Commentary On Book Four Of Virgil's Aeneid is an impressively annotated translation that presents the classic and widely read book four of Aeneid (the story of Dido and Aeneas) in English translation along with a translation of Servius' own detailed and renowned commentary. On the facing pages are the original Latin text and commentary. Notes further illuminate this excellent presentation for both classical literature and Latin language students."
2,"Wow, what a smell!","We've used Stage 1 refills for the last year even though we have a toddler eating solids, and basically everything else too! The Stage 1s were great. Very good at keeping odors in - not much on the smelly side. Unfortunately it seems that the Stage 1s are being discontinued and we are left with these refills that we have tried, but we couldn't have the Diaper Genie in the same room with us because of the very strong odor of these refills! Now I definately don't like the smell of dirty diapers, the only thing worse is the smell of the refills! Please Playtex, could you go with about 10% of the odor you add to these?"
4,Lots and Lots of Planes DVD,The package was not damaged. We have not watched the video yet because it is for my son at Christmas.
3,Big mix,"This is a collection (mix) of dancehall reggae of late 1994. There are 22 great tracks! - including: Beenie Man, Merciless, Admiral Bailey, Silvercat, Honorable Apache, Frisco Kid, Jigsy King, Louie Culture, Terry Ganzie, Burro Banton, Future Troubles, General Degree, Snagga Puss, Squidly Ranks, Chuckleberry... I would give this mix 5 stars without no hesitation if not the MC Jabba that keeps shouting all the time through the whole album (which is very annoying for me, but some people might like it)."
5,Refute of facts in another reviewer's review...,"If you're a fan of Disfarmer's work or of portraits in particular, you will love this book; the Heber Spring portraits are a slice of rural American life and are historically and culturally interesting to me. But also, in response to the previous reviewer I thought it was important for readers to know that Mike Disfarmer did not grow up in the town where he took the photos that made him famous, nor did he ever, to my knowledge, wake up with amnesia! He did change his name from Meyer (farmer in German) to DisFarmer, to dissociate himself from his family. He was a reclusive, distant man that wasn't necessarily remembered fondly. He is famous for the photographs he took of the small town folk of Heber Springs, Arkansas, but he did not move there until he was around 30 years of age. Many of his years before moving to Heber Springs remain a mystery. You can learn more about him on [...]"
1,Don't Buy This CD.,"I'm a die-hard punk fan, and trust me: The only way this music would sound punk is if you sandwiched it between George Winston and Raffi. I agree with Bugbread and the Subway comment below. These songs are dumb, dumb, dumb; and this CD belongs in the trash, trash, trash."
3,Old Fashioned bundt pan.,"This bundt pan is fine. However it is very light (not heavy). I thought that I was buying one like I already have which is a heavy pan. I guess that I assumed that it was heavy, and I was buying it for a gift. I didn't give this one as a gift."
1,NordicWare 51122 Bundt Pan,"I was very disappointed when I recieved the Bundt pan. I purchased it for a gift and was too embarrassed to give it. I went to Wal-Mart and bought a much better quality pan for 1 dollar more and that is not considering the shipping cost. I would have sent it back but for $13.50 it wasn't worth the time, packaging and postage to return it. Go to Wal-Mart on this one."
3,Good Value,The rack does work for two bicycles. The construction is light weight but it seems to do the job.
4,Bell Bike Rack,This is a fairly good solution to carrying our bikes with our pickup and SUV. The only problem we encountered is putting a girl's bike on. It needs another bar which we purchased from the bike store. The price is right and it holds the bikes just fine. My son says to take it off when not in use as the plastic heats in summer and cracks.
5,No disappointment for 12 year old,Item was reasonably priced and arrived quickly. My son has installed it on his Traxxes truck and is very happy with it.
2,not up to par with other travel video series,"We enjoy travel/music videos of places we have been. I bought this to try this series. It is totally disjointed - one moment the history of Knossos, History Channel-style recreations of life in antiquity, then a visit to a modern olive grove - and on and on. There are a few nice scenes of villages and beaches on the islands but for me much of the video does not fit well together, and the History Channel insertsdetract and devalue. I won't buy any more of this series. The Shepherd series and Naxos series are great."
3,disappointing,"The first edition of this book painted a glowing picture of money to be made in the art print market. This second edition (and especially the author's website) give a much less positive view. Change and problems in the industry are the real problem, not the author, who obviously knows his stuff. Read about the art print market on the web, it may change again, and if it does Davey's next book will be the one to get."
1,This book is a complete waste of time.,"Unfortunately, for all the book provides, there are enough problems with it that I have to wonder if it missed out on some much-needed editing. The author's describtive ability is extremly limited. Overall the book was very poor. Try something else and save your time and money."
4,Great book!,"""Garfield goes to waist"" was a great book that me and my family enjoyed. It was funny, made us laugh, and most importanly, overall was a great book."
2,Must read for students and new managers.,"Change at Work is a must read for high-school students, college students, and those seeking careers in management. Cappelli has a no nonsense approach with detailing those issues impacting our careers, the work environment, and the future. For those wondering if a technical or college education is worthwhile, Cappelli gives you good reasons for furthering your education. Cappelli and his co-authors do an outstanding job detailing those issues and circumstances faced by today's workers and managers of all business, i.e., corporate America, government agencies and other nonprofit entities, and the smallest of ma-and-pa companies. Cappelli does not offer good solutions for any of the issues he raises in this work. Unfortunately for professionals and management already in the work force, Change at Work offers no new knowledge."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I purchased this DVD since my son was going to do a sememster abroad in Australia. We watched it together and all I could say afterwards is,""Is that it!"" Not really worth the purchase. I went to the library afterwards and watched many more interesting DVDs for free."
4,Nice Present for a Traveler,"I gave this DVD as a birthday present to a friend who was planning a trip to Australia within a couple of months. I have not seen the documentary and can only comment on my friend's reaction to watching it frequently before her trip. She was pleased with the information, scenery, and especially the animals on the film. She has a hectic schedule and little time for TV and films. However, she commented several times how much she was enjoying this DVD. She's in Australia now, so I'll have to wait until she returns to find out if it helped her during the trip."
3,"Ok, not as good as expected",I expected more video of some of the scenic areas in Australia. This DVD focuses on the animals in Australia and the terrain. I was hoping it would include something on the Great Barrier Reef but it didn't. The video was good quality and the narration was informative.
5,"Great stories, very nice photos",The book has the stores of the life and death of several famous as well as relatively unknown warships of WWII.Every ship profiled has some claim to fame and the text explored it nicely but not exhaustively. The pictures are excellent in quality and quantity. Many of the pictures are not found elsewhere. I really enjoy this book and reread the stories often. Its not a deep historical research book but more of a good coffee table book of the lives and ends of several ships.
5,Sam Blumenfeld's Own Words about his book,"Length:: 1:59 MinsI found this video of Sam Bluemfeld himself, the author of NEA: Trojan Horse in American Education and thought it would probably be of interest to anyone considering buying the book. It's short and to the point.NEA: Trojan Horse in American Education"
1,Piece of garbage,I have had this piece of garbage for over a year...shame on me for keeping it...you get what you pay for....noisiest! Clanking and banging back and forth....I have used more ink just resetting this so called consumer best buy. Just try and print out an envelope... I have tried to allign after each new cartridge and I get error cartridge stuck...or page did not finish printing...I hope this machine is outdated and would NOT recommend this to anyone! Save the money!Frustrated in Jersey
3,Cannot network print,"I like the all in one design, but the software is abnxious compared to my previous lexmark. Not nearly as user friendly. And it CANNOT be set up to print wireless over a network. Big downfall for me."
4,Fills the need,"Past inkjet printer died, and I needed a new one fast and at a low price. This fit the bill. Plus I could get rid of my old scanner to boot. It seems to be printing and scaning fine and quility is good. Haven't had it long enough to use all the options yet. I have had it long enough to find so far the only draw back ink. The cost of cartridges are a little steep."
3,Good for low usage,"I have used this printer consistently for over to years now. As a graphic designer I have put it through a lot of work in these two years and it show. I can't print anything that uses a lot of ink anymore because it can't handle it. However, it did work well under heavy usage for over two years, I have no problems with paper not pulling, but it does eat A LOT of ink. On or two full page images is enough to eat a cartridge unless you let it sit overnight."
3,Incredibly slow software install/uninstal process,"I only tried the HP 1410 (only the scanner) for a few days before returning it, therefore, I do not know much about its strongpoints. What I can say is that it has had by far the slowest software install I have ever seen (on my computer or elsewhere) - some 300 MBs (how much the installed show as occupying) took about 100 minutes !!! (I'm not kidding) to install and about 30 (!!) to uninstall (not to mention it wanted a restart after uninstall). I know I have a slow computer, but I've installed and uninstalled larger programes in considerably less than that.As for the scanner, I'm no expert, but I found it slow and of rather poor quality (scans of books seemed a little blury and did not have much of a contrast)."
2,uses too much ink,I've had the printer for two weeks. I'm in the process of printing invitations and have gone through two ink cartriges of both color and black. I am priting only about 40 cards (on both sides) yet i used up the ink cartridges in one sitting. I didn't even finish rinting them. At over twenty dollar each. It's not a cheap printer to use. The low price of the printer does not make up for the high cost of running it.
1,Going Broke,"The psc 1410 is simple and easy to use, but ...it has the smallest capacity ( 5 ml ) print cartridges I've ever seen. Be prepared to buy new ink cartridges every week!"
1,The Worst Printer Imaginable,"Everything is designed to be an inconvenience. Every time you turn it on, a full page test print is done and wastes ink. It prints horribly, fails consistently, and is awkward to use in every respect. It jams and doesn't feed correctly, print processes will hang endlessly. Stay away no matter what."
1,a title for your review,"This printer stinks. It comes cheap and has all sorts of cool features, but I can never get it to come on. I have spent hour after hour working on it, and I can never get it to print. I really need to buy a new one."
3,A cute read,"Relies a little bit too much on biology for my liking, but it has some cute anecdotes and scenarios along with some practical advice. A fun read if not taken too seriously."
2,Same old story,I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for a book that would give me an unbiased discussion about these two women and their relationship. Instead I found it was really just another of many many books that put Elizabeth on a pedestal and Mary somewhere very much lower.
3,A mostly-charming treat...just one trick.,"I awaited the release of this book with keen anticipation, and overall, find it a delightful retrospective of Halloween celebrations of days gone by. The excerpts from vintage magazines and party guides are charming. My chief complaint lies with the design and treatment of the visuals in the book - they are painfully small. At such a reduced size, they don't allow the reader to fully appreciate the charm of the vintage advertisements, postcards, invitations and photos of costumed revelers."
4,Charming little book,"There are a lot of bright spots in this book: the reader's Elvis impersonation is one of them. You also get a feel for Elvis's childlike enthusiasm and charm: I particularly liked the part where Elvis gets a horse and then decides that all his friends should have horses. He then goes out and buys a stable full of horses. Several little stories like that make this book worth reading. On the critical side, this book may not be well suited for audio format: the narrative overall is very choppy. But that isn't reason enough not to read it: thumbs up for this one!"
3,Not as good as it should be.,"I have reviewed this book and must say that although Peter is a fantastic researcher the work comes up very short and has sunken to the level of Alana Nash. I am at the point where it is almost better to only read from people that were actually around Elvis like Joe Esposito or Jerry Schilling. Read what they write and you cannot go wrong. From Joe Esposito Remember Elvis, Elvis Straight Up and the Celebrate Elvis series with Daniel Lombardy. Jerry Schilling his book Me and a guy. If you want a great Guralnick book aquire Elvis Day by Day pound for pound the best in terms of an Elvis dictionary."
4,Only sent 11 picks.,"I bought these picks as part of my cousin's Christmas present. There was meant to be 12 picks per pack, but there were only 11 in the package.On the other hand if you order these picks you might get lucky and get 13.The picks themselves are good, just what I was expecting, I'm sure she'll like them."
3,OK PICKS,"I purchased these because I have difficulty holding on to my pick when doing fast strumming. For me, these are no easier to hold onto than any other regular pick."
3,"Looks pink, but actually purple","I bought these picks for my daughter and she loves everything pink, unfortunately these are more on the purple side even though the picture looks like they are pink."
3,I'VE SEEN BETTER GAMES,"Well, there are some good effects on the game but you can just count them with your finger because there are not that much. The gameplay is pretty cool but there's no point on a good gameplay if the graphics won't help at all. The game is not difficult and actually is always the same...There are monsters in some village controled by a bigger monster and you've to beat the crap out of the big one in order for the little ones to die. It's always the same, the only thing that changes is the village. And what this thing 'bout upgrading weapons?...What's the point? It's very expensive and is so much better to buy a better one than to upgrade the one you already have. Well you can definetively buy the game and see for yourself but I'd rather spend my money in a good and fancy dinner."
5,mosher from way back,i will put it simple if you are interested in this style of music(thrash) this cd has to be in your collection.this album belongs in the top 2 of all time.i could'nt tell you how many times i have bloodied my knuckles in the pit to this album.and to the guy in one of the other reviews who was putting slayer down obviously does not respect the 80's thrash movement.slayer is still kicking after more than 20 years of keeping to their roots.mosh it.
3,"Nice but,",Purchased this album with high expectations. I was disappointed.Song selections and singing were modestly exciting. Just wasn't my kind of music.
5,"Best book available on the subject, bar none!","This is an outstanding work. Lots of variations, values, rare types, all branches, etc. I have never found another like this. The information made available is wonderful and in many instances, the author reveals facts that are little-known, or in some cases, rights erroneous, generally accepted information. Gorgeous color plates, all original patches, etc. Many, I've never seen before. The most helpful is the info on how to determine authenticity. That alone is worth the read! Excellent, excellent book!"
5,Nice Suspenders,The leather suspenders work well. They hold up heavy loads. Suspenders come with belt loops. They are ready to go out of the package........
3,"Worth getting if only for ""Tread Softly Stranger"" with Diana Dors","These obscure British films have never been on DVD in US before and - to my knowledge at least most were not on VHS. I chanced on to this one to see the 1958 film ""Tread Softly Stranger"" with Diana Dors - which received excellent reviews when released in the UK as a PAL DVD. I'm glad I spent the time on this film. Not only is Dors - a combo Jayne Mansfield (but with a slimmer figure) and Marilyn Monroe actress - both sexy and erotic, but the tale of a robbery gone wrong has some great twists and turns. The other films on this set aren't quite as good in my opinion.The prints are not sharp but apparently the best that can be hoped for until someone takes the time - and money - to restore them. But at least they are out there for all the word to see. The other improvement that could be made with this set is a series of film notes about the actors, directors and the British film industry.Steve Ramm""anything Phonographic"""
3,Interesting stories,"Incorruptibles, published by TAN Books, documents 102 cases of saints and beatified who have been shown to have bodies that have not decayed. Some of these saints (like in the case of St. Francis Xavier) literally were placed in extreme conditions, very conducive to decay and bodily destruction, but remained intact. Each case is carefully researched (which is a very strong suit of this book) and well-documented (102 cases in 310 pages). Each case is presented with a short review of the saints life (where applicable) and the case for ""incorruption"" (i.e.: conditions of burial, etc). The downside of this book however is that there are very few pictures of the bodies. I think that with all the research done in this book, that a few more pictures, and more close-up shots of the ones that were taken would have made this book an even better resource. As it stands, the lack of pictures and close-ups is what knocks this book down to 3 stars."
3,Inspirational,"The photos and stories of these precious canonized Saints are wonderful. Their bodies, in some cases mostly free of corruption and some not so well preserved probably due to display and contact with the public and candles. It's very provocative and well worth buying."
3,COULD BE BETTER,"I LIKE THE FACT THAT I FEEL RELAX EVEYTHING TIME I HEAR THE CD THAT I FALL AS SLEEP, BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT DOESN'T HELP ME MUCH AS ADVERTISED. I HAD A BETTER SUBLIMINAL CASSETTE I WISH I CAN FIND IT TO RE-SELL THIS ONE ..."
2,"Entertaining, but lost it's focus at the end","I'm a fan of books about the Arthurian legend and similar themes, such as The Mysts Of Avalon and DaggerSpell. The idea of Arthur reappearing in modern times to complete unfinished business was intriguing, and for a while The Third Magic really held my attention. Unfortunately, in the last third I felt the book started losing focus. To much attention was given to all the interrelationships of the character's past lives and in the end the whole thing just melted down. Still, I appreciated being reminded of the ""old magic"" and give the book two stars. If you're new to the Arthurian Legend I would not recommend this book as an introduction, but for old hands it can be a pleasant diversion."
1,I can't believe my disappointment,"I have read The Forever King many times and always loved it and shoved it at everyone I knew. The second book in this series' The Broken Sword was...well, not awful, but had some plot problems and certainly didn't compare favorably with the first novel. Well, I just completed the debacle that is The Third Magic and can't believe how many problems there are. Inconsistencies abound, sometimes within the same paragraph. I honestly have to wonder if Ms. Cochran even reread her first two books in the series before she sat down to pen this one. She doesn't seem to remember accurately most of what had gone before. I had waited on this novel for so long and my disappointment is huge. If you have to know what happens in this book because you have read the first two, borrow it, don't buy it"
3,Derivative,"As a practicing English teacher, I believe strongly in the value of SSR. I read this book hoping to hear new research supporting SSR, or at least innovative methods for its implementation. That said, Mr. Gardiner's book is a disappointment. If a teacher is starting completely from scratch with SSR, this book might be worth a read. I didn't find much information that I hadn't already come across in books by Atwell, Krashen, or Pilgreen. In our district, ASCD books are well received by administrators, and if this holds true around the country, perhaps this text will extend SSR into more classrooms."
4,It's OK,"I know that Morris had trouble getting into the subject and had to invent a world populated with among other characters a fictionalized self. Once you get past the fact that what your reading is a kind of ""faction"" its OK.I learned a lot about Reagan and even developed a degree of respect for him as person (not as a president).One thing I must say is that if you enjoy a well turned phrase and creative use of vocabulary you will love the way Morris writes this tale."
1,Hugely disappointed,"This was a hugely disappointing book. I looked for a professional, objective statement of the Reagan presidency. Instead we got cheap shots of a personal nature before the book even began to tell its ""story"", as well as inflated personal assessments of the Reagan presidency. It would be an improvement if Mrs Reagan or one of their children gathered up his letters and memos and did a book like George Bush's. It would certainly be more entertaining and enlightening (even though there are problemns with that method). It beats this authors so-called method."
3,Set aside plenty of time to read this book,"I read the reviews before I bought the book. I understood that the author had introduced himself as a narrator of sorts. I had no idea how intrusive this tactic would be. I normally read books at a pretty fast clip and retain the information pretty well. In this case, I had to keep checking to make sure I understood whether the author was talking about Reagan or about himself, which isn't even quite himself, but a person similar to himself that might have lived when and where Reagan lived. I found the book very informative, but I thought gaining information was relatively painful."
2,Disappointing Morris Work,"The trouble with this book is that I expected so much more from a historian of Morris' talents. He had 14 years..writers with half his talent would have come up with something better than this. Morris' interjection of himself into the book is distracting, which is such a shame becasue he didn't have to do that. As I read, I kept asking myself, ""Where were the friends and editors of Edmund Morris when he began to pursue this insane tanget?"" Why didn't someone wave him off and say, ""Hey man, you're trashing your reputation.""Morris is a excellent writer and the bulk of this book is good stuff. Unfortunately, the fictionalized parts are so disturbing that I would recommend people save their money and wait until someone else takes a shot at the definitive Reagan biography. No doubt, whoever does write that book will be quoting generously from Morris' work...but only the real parts."
4,Just relax and enjoy.,"Please ignore all the media and polital hype about the style of Edmund Morris' incredibly facinating ""memoir."" Instead of taking the bait and moving back and forth between the text and the footnotes, simply read the book as pure and simple entertainment -- not a epic historical biography. I'm sure the book will sell like hotcakes (and it should), but it should be for its merit as an excellent read rather than a political/social issue. As Dutch would say, ""There you go again..."""
1,A missed chance for a biography of a true Americcan,"The author's ego got in the way of his mission. It should be titled ""Edmund Morris and Other Stories about Ronald Reagan"". He continually talked down to Reagan as an intelletual superior. All I can say is that I thank my lucky stars that Ronald Reagan and not Edmund Morris was my president for eight years. He just blew his chance to write a good book"
1,Does Edmund Morris really exist?,"Enthralled by Morris' Rise Of Theodore Roosevelt, I waited for another magnificent window on history to open. Unfortunately, the window provided only a few insightful views and a vast amount of cynicism. EM's unprecedented access should have sought more than a one-line explanation of Ronald Reagan. While appearing to be thoroughly researched the book disappointed me with the spin applied to events and substantial inaccuracies reported in the two events of which I have firsthand knowledge. Makes me wonder if Teddy really did....Please leave the fictional characters at home."
3,Great President; Poor Book,"How in the world could Edmund Morris have dropped the ball on this? I ignored the press and gave this book a fair chance. But the author's ""method"" of inserting himself into the book makes it unclear when he is talking about fact or fiction throughout the book.If he had simply written a straight forward biography he would have been much better served. That's why he was commissioned for the job and many of us Americans who lived through the '80s have been waiting for this book for a long time. Morris let us all down with this rambling scrapbook."
1,A hugely disappointing piece of junk,"Morris' book is an insult to all of us who waited for years to read the authorized Reagan biography. Instead, we got a historical novel which tells nothing about Reagan beyond the fact that he was difficult to get to know. Well, lots of people are like that, but the job of a biographer is to work at explaining what a person is like despite the difficulty of doing so. Morris instead gives up on this task and gives us a pretentious, quasi-literary/poetic evocation of Reagan, which I could have written myself using already-available sources. Where is the evidence of the hundreds of hours of first-hand observation that Morris had of the Reagan White House? Not in this book. I tried to give Dutch no stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me, so the one I gave to it is more than it deserves. Read McCullough's Truman for an example of a well-researched and well-written biography, and don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk."
1,innacurate and hard to read,"I dont care that the authors technique was unusual, but I do care that the book is a torture to read. The story jumps around from situation to situation, and from person to person so much that it sometimes doesnt make sense. Also, the style is so overly flowery, almost like a poorly written poem, that it becomes quite tedious.The author is more concerned with his own viewpoints and feelings that he forgets that the book is supposed to be about someone else.All in all a very disappointing tome."
1,Where's the Reagan?,"I have been laboring through this book and I don't know if I can finish it. I didn't want an autobiography of Edmund Morris, but that's what I got. And in it, I learned about this hoity toity fuddy-duddy old fart who hates the fact that he never got to know Ronald Reagan. Perhaps Reagan sensed that this weirdo couldn't be trusted. I understand that the review must stick to the contents of the book, and since Edmund Morris decided to write his own memoir and trick people into reading it by disguising it as a Reagan memoir, I feel perfectly justified in criticizing this writer. I'm dismayed that this man spent so much time with Reagan and failed to see what made him great. Morris couldn't even refrain from condescension and jealosy in relaying the most innocuous information. If you were looking for a Reagan Memoir, keep looking."
2,*Not* a history of a president,"This is not, in itself, a bad book. The fictional narratortakes himself far too seriously -- and putting his made up 'diary' inthe footnotes is ludicrous. But my main complaint is that it covers much less of Ronald Reagan's political life than we have a right to expect. There's almost nothing on the 1980 or 1984 campaigns, and pretty close to that on 8 years worth of domestic policy making. There are very interesting pieces on RR's relations with the USSR, and Morris writes well, even brilliantly at times, when he's not writing about himself. Somewhere in here is 40 pages of a fantastic ""summing up Reagan"" article trying to get out. But for anyone doing research on Reagan the president, this is not the place to go -- and it should have been."
1,"Should be called Edmund Morris, I love to write about myself","As a person who voted in my first election in 1980 for RonaldReagan, and as a person who had many a disagreement with his policiesduring the eight years he served, I anticipated reading a well written, in depth look at the man and his times. Unfortunately, Mr. Morris' book is not any of those things. Aside from the almost unreadable prose, the poorly orgainized material, and the lack of any sort of thoughtful analysis of what drove Reagan to be Reagan, the book is simply first and formost about Edmund Morris. Do you remember the SNL character Al Frankin? His famous line was ""What does this mean for me, Al Frankin?"" Well, Edmund Morris is the Al Frankin of Reagan biographers. Do Not Buy This Book. I am going to do my best to get my money back. I can only say as a student of history with a degree in the field, this book is plain awful. Shame on you Edmund Morris."
1,"Stupid Concept, Bad Novel","Edmund Morris tossed away his reputation as a biographer on the par with the biggest names in the business, indulged himself in an unrealized ambition and made his book on President Reagan into a work of fiction. What was he thinking? And what were his editors thinking? It was hard to get past the slightly goofy/creepy concept of a non-fiction novel where the author intrudes so often into the story, but the secondary and damning fact here is that this is also not a good book at all. Morris says inexplicable things about his subject like when he mentions the clarity of our fortieth President's saliva. What was THAT about? Morris might recover from this, who knows, but my advice to anyone, Reagan fan, history student, lover of fiction, is don't pick up this book because it's not even slightly worth your time."
1,How can you be so close and fumble the ball????,"All of the press on this book is the only reason I read it. I already have my opinion of President Reagan and his Presidency. I have read several other books about Reagan, liberally and conservatively biased, and Dutch was by far the most ignorant of them all. I repect what Reagan did for America. But the whole purpose of this book is to smear Reagan and leave a lasting black-mark on his legacy. Who paid off Mr. Morris? I am not a biographer. However, if I had all of the access and time that Mr. Morris had, I could have written everyone a 10 thousand page encyclopedia set. What an absolute waste!"
4,i like the new format in biographical writing,"i have to say right off i am not a fan of ronald reagan. the book provided a welcomed behind the scenes look at the countries most distinguished citizen. the book makes a compelling statement that reagan always believed that everything he did was for the good of the american people. no matter what your idealogy or your fair recollection of events, the book is interesting and well writen in a style which for me is a relief from dull boring biographical accounts that have predominated in the industry as of late. i like him as a man more than i did before reading the book, but not alot."
1,Fiasco,"Page for page, Dutch is the single daffiest book I have ever read from a widely respected author. Edmund Morris, author of celebrated works about Theodore Roosevelt, was given extensive access to Ronald Reagan and the workings of his administration. Even Reagan's admirers admit the man had a downright spooky lack of affect in his dealings with others, and the strain of dealing with this sphynx apparently unmanned Morris, who elected to blend biography and fiction by writing himself into Reagan's life, showing himself present at all kinds of crucial events -- even being rescued from drowning by Reagan as a young lifeguard. A bizarre performance that has left me unwilling to read anything else by Edmund Morris, even though his Roosevelt books would normally be right up my alley."
2,Still waiting,"We waited for this, wanted it, needed it, and got such a disapointment. Morris glosses over important events, using the space to try to show that he is an intellectual. Am I the only one that will say I object to a writer assuming that we all know French?"
3,Interesting...But Confusing,"Mr. Morris' book was extremely well-written and readable. I was able to rush through it and understand all of it. Unfortunately, Mr. Morris' literary device in portraying Dutch's life was confusing at best. Often, it is exceedingly difficult to say whether what is being read actually happened or simply comes from Morris' mind. He should have been able to write the book without using the literary device. Finally, the book had the worst ending that could possibly be imagined. Mr. Morris should not have finished the book using his fake characters. I would recommend this book. However, read it carefully!"
3,Enormous intrusion of Morris' ego into this biography,"I have to agree with one of Reagon's kids who said that Morris had blown an invaluable opportunity.This could have been a great book. It is certainly well researched, with many fascinating insights. However, the author's inability to keep his ego out of it made for enormously difficult reading. I felt that I was constantly fighting an almost palpable presence that was coming between me and the subject, Ronald Reagon. Between the author's intrusion of himself as a character, and all sorts of stylistic peculiarities, this book is a major problem to track. I just skipped over big hunks of pages because I wasn't willing to put forth the effort."
4,Fiction/Nonfiction concept not so bad,"As a die hard nonfiction reader the idea of having an author insert himself as a fictional character in a biography of such importance sounded pretty disgusting to me at first thought. Surprisingly I have found it to not be as disruptive as I was expecting. There are tons of notes to verify comments that were made to the author about Mr.Reagan from a very impressive list of past and present friends, family, enemies, etc. The author has covered Mr. Reagans' life to the smallest detail and I found it to be an enjoyable read. If you are a true Reaganite I believe you will also enjoy this book."
1,Dutch:A Memior of Ronald Reagan,"Totally disappointing. Continually tried to grasp the author's intend. Convened entirely too much to author and many, many others not remotely related to memoirs of Ronald Reagan. Too many paraphases, acronyms, abbreviation and meaningless paradoxes. Failed to convey any sustantial contributions to Ronald Reagan. Would not recommend reading to anyone. I purchased copies for myself and a friend. Have decided not to give to friend."
1,I had to put this book down...,"So who is Ronald Reagan? a brilliant, humble, discreet diplomat, or an actor all the way? I Could'nt get an answer this time!"
3,Ken'l-Lan 128 8oz,This is a good disenfectant for animal quarters and kills most of the common nasties and a few not so common. Ken'l-Lan 128 doesn't have a strong odor or perfume smell which is a big plus in my book. The only major drawback is the pink color which can stain clothes or table tops when diluting. If you do get the concentrate on clothing it can be permanent if allowed to dry.
5,Just loved this book,"Jimmy buffett is so talanted, and this is every bit as good as his music and other books. Any child is captured by this and I really love playing Joly Mon song before and after I read it. Another Buffet 5 star!"
5,A Must Have For Any 2nd Generation Parrotheads!,"We all remember our favorite books from our childhood years. Just the title brings back a warm fuzzy feeling to our now stressed bodies. That is how this book affects me now. I was 9 years old when I was given this book by my Dad, a devoted parrothead. It instantly became my favorite book of all time. I would read it and invision myself off sailing in tropical places, fishing with sticks and fighting off pirates with my bare hands. I also loved that this book was co-written by Buffett and his young daughter Savannah. I believe that this is the reason the book truly captures the imagination that only a child can radiate. THIS IS A MUST HAVE! PUT IT IN YOUR SHOPPING CART RIGHT NOW!"
5,Excellent Story,"This book is an excellent story that will be read to my grandson since before birth. He ""dances"" to the Jimmy Buffet song ""Jolly Mon Sings"" in womb so I just know he'll love it after he's born. A true Buffet fan since ""before"" birth."
5,Survival Kit Review,Excellent book. Well written. Great information. Lots of great ideas & websites & other books the Author refers to. Easy to follow pictures too so you can build YOUR OWN Survival Kit instead of buying a Pre-Made one.
3,Gadgetry vs survival,If you like gizmos..you'll love this book it is full of cool gear stuffed into all kinds of containers. If you like a kit based on practical survival philosophy and outdoor experience.... Look elsewhere.I suggest the 32 page 2 Kilogram Survival Kit by Mors Kochanski and published by Karamat Wilderness Ways.
5,Two Words-Sandy Duncan,"This DVD is killer...I can't wait for the future seasons. It brings you back to a time when everything was simple and Jim Henson was on top of the world. As far as this installment goes...SANDY DUNCAN...You have got to see her skit about, ""a nice girl hanging in a bar that never closes."" Honestly, you couldn't see something this provacative on today's prime time TV. Get this DVD and watch Sandy and you tell me, I bet you'll be binge drinking your way to fun just like her :-)"
2,US version is NOT complete,"Due to Disney's aquisition of the Muppets franchise these episodes are missing key elements originally broadcast. Song licensing problems from Disney has meant that many classic moments have been cut.The Cuts Include-""You've Got A Friend"" Sung by Vincent Price""Old Fashioned Way"" Sung by Charles Aznavour""All Of Me"" (Paul Williams Episode) Sung by Two Monsters""The Danceros"" (Jim Nabors Episode) Sung by The Danceros""Gone with the Wind"" Sung by Jim Nabors""Stormy Weather"" Sung by Wayne and WandaThere are also cuts in the intro sequences and backstage chit chat preceding the songs. Also two Muppet News sketches and a balcony scene featuring Statler and Waldorf are missing.If you want the FULL UNCUT episodes I sugest buying the UK Region 2 version instead of this butchered so called ""Special Edition"""
2,Dated,"I love the Muppets and really enjoyed them with my daughters in the 80's. Based on reviews, I decided to purchase Season One first. I have only seen several episodes and am already disappointed. The stars include Ruth Buzzi, Connie Stevens, Joel Grey, Juliette Prowse. Ok, they may have been stars back then, but for the life of me, I don't know why. They are definitely the weak link in each episode. In fact, they are a distraction. I was just very disappointed and have no intention of buying any more seasons."
5,Classic.,"What else is there to be said? It's The Muppet Show!I could go on and on about what features are on what disk, and what the special features are, and how good it all looks on DVD, but most of the other reviewers have already done that -- some in excruciating detail. They're all completely right, of course, but that's not the point.If you remember watching this as a kid, you'll love it. You'll see episodes and be able to sing along like you'd just seen it yesterday. You'll laugh at the gags like you've just seen it for the first time. Your kids will love it just as much as you did (and still do). And THAT'S what makes this a five-star, must-have set.You'll thank yourself when you pick this up."
5,What great memories for me and the kids love it too,I remember watching the Muppet Show as a kid.Now it is fun to watch them again.It is also fun to hear my boys laughing at several of the skits.Jim Henson's Muppetts have humor for both Adults and ChildrenA Classic TV Show. Wonderful guest stars. So much fun.
2,A CHOPPED UP MESS!!!!!!,"A-lot of the episodes are re-edited and some of the parts that made the episodes most memorable are gone or have different replacement scenes. I don't know why they bothered. I don't recommend this to any die hard fan they have ruined the magic. Jim Henson would not have approved of the way these were butchered. This is sad, I'm tired of buying the box sets of old TV shows and they're being butchered for politically correctness, or for copyright reasons."
2,spread,"Not a movie type I would purchase again. Strong sexual content, but story well done. The result of lead's actions ring true. What is fun now doesn't carry over as fun in the full light of day.vidman426"
4,VERY GOOD MOVIE,"I AM A FAN OF ASTON KUTCHER'S, THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE HIS VOICE IN IT, LOVE ANNE HECHE'S PARTS, VERY GOOD MOVIE"
3,snoochi woochi,"it works but the damb thing broke after 6 days, wehne i droped it. what a poopshoot. yeahhhhhhhhh"
1,Avoid this printer,"I have had this printer for a year. I don't print very often. Of all the pages I have printed on this printer, I would say that 40% were ""alignment"" sheets. It prints this page every time I turn the damn thing on. There is no way to turn this printing off - and of course these sheets are printed in color! The cartridges are expensive ($45 for a color and Black combo with only 5ml of ink) I have spent way too much on the ink. It would have been more cost effective to print at kinkos. The software that came with this was too bloated and was rarely used.This was my first experience with an HP product and surely my last."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I am a college student and use my printer- alot. As soon as I had a big paper due, the printer DIED, non-responsive, unplugged and replugged cords. A few days later is magically turned itself back on. In the month that I've had it, I have changed the black ink cartridge 4 times and the color cartridge 3 times. Frequently the paper jams and prints out blank pages among what I'm printing. Unreliable and high maintenence compared to past printers I have had-I do NOT recommend this product.*update*This printer, which I bought not even three months ago, has died. It has been safely on my desk without exposure to excessive heat, cold, or moisture. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,The most frustrating printer ever,"This printer absolutely refuses to operate with any consistency. It either pulls a dozen sheets of paper from the tray and clogs itself up, or only one sheet about halfway, clogging itself again. Even babying it, trying to feed it one sheet at a time proves to be an exercise in frustration.I have never seen such a shoddy piece of equipment, and regret having purchased it. Other than that, it makes a great paperweight."
3,I purchased this about 6 months ago but rarely use it.,"-As you've probably figured out by now, this printer goes through ink quicky.-I haven't been able to figure out how to scan, or it's just not working.-The photo's I've printed have been of average quality.-My biggest gripe is everytime I turn it 'off' to 'on' it prints a test page; a waste of ink and annoying."
2,Don't let the price fool you - it's expensive!,"This printer eats ink like crazy! I occassionally print pages off the web, and I'm changing the cartridges more than once a month. I would guess I'm getting 50-70 pages per cartridge. It's very disappointing. I can't afford to print anything! I'm going to try something I never thought I would - refilled ink cartridges!Otherwise, I would be satisfied with the printer. It scans well, prints well. I've had no trouble with compatibility (Win XP) as others here report. I'll count my blessings on that! But next time, I'll buy another brand."
1,i wish i had the money to get a new printer,"What a piece of crap. It wants to allign your cartridges every time you turn the computer on, you have to hand feed the paper, endless paper jams...my current problem is that it won't recognize it's own ink cartridges so I can't print anything. I don't know what I'm going to do when I start having to print MA papers & my master's thesis b/c even w/hand feeding paper, it will only print a 10 page document.I didn't realize it installed another user onto my computer until I started having problems w/my virus software & it started to kill the running time on my computer.The customer service stinks too.I will never buy anything from HP again."
2,has a few very annoying flaws,"when it works it's pretty good, but the paper is constantly getting jammed, and the scanner frequently only scans part of the page. After a few months of using it, I found it helpful to load the paper one page at a time, I know it sounds like that would be a pain to do, but actually it's easier to put the paper in one page at a time, than to deal with the constant paper jams or the printer not being able to reconize that it has paper already loaded"
3,missing some features,had the 1315 before that. had more options in terms of format of saved scans. could have been nice to have an SD. CF reader built-in as well as a faster loading software.
1,great for about one cartridge,"It does not empty cartridges, and it starts developing feed problems after a while. would not buy it again"
1,Waste of money and time,"If you still want to go with HP, at least get the smaller deskjet version where you'll save a lot of time and money.I have so many problems with this model.a) I can't print when I want to, because there's always some software issue.b) The ink spills out, and if the software can't read my ink level, I can't print at all.c) Even after putting in a new ink-cartridge, the printer would print couple of pages thereafter, and returning back to the ""no ink cartridge problem"".d) If you trying to fix the ink level, the printer will keep printing align pages automatically, thus wasting your ink and papers.Seriously, don't buy this junk.Save yourself the agony and time by looking for other reliable all-in-one printers--preferably not an HP model."
2,10 minutes of service for 10 hours of effort,The title says it all.I own it for 2 years or more. A year ago I got a replacement. Both items together printed max 20 pages. So what will that be 10 or so minutes.But I think I wasted more than 10 hours on this piece of junk and the hp support people to get it working.I am giving it 2 stars because the scanner part of it worked okay for me.
1,Don't waste your time..,"More high starch dieting, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary It will just screw with your insulin metabolism..."
4,"""Must"" reading for health-conscious women.","The McDougall Plan has been around for at least 16 years, and the value of a starch-based diet has been proved again and again. This book zeroes in on the special needs of women. The McDougalls' advice is well researched: they again give many scientific and medical references for their statements. I've followed the general lifestyle for many years, with good results."
1,Very disabled and clunky,"I had exactly the same problem as the viewer before me. Many of the items in the catalog are disabled for some reason, with no warning. I found that while trying to place a cabinet. There were other problems as well. Skip this product and look for another. I haven't found one yet that won't cost me hundreds of dollars."
3,Very Good,"This book is excellent, but I gave it only 4 stars because it has some very boring moments, describing the lives, for example, of Phil Jackson's parents. Otherwise, it is great reading."
2,End of the road,"I really liked the beginning books in this series but with this one I've had enough; I can't take it anymore - hearing about Flinx's headaches, his problems using his talent, his passivity, it just drives me nuts. And if you get to the end of this book, you will feel cheated, just like I did, when you realize the whole build-up throughout the book gets wiped out in one page.Seriously?I feel like this was a season finale of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or some crap sitcom where a main character gets shot and no resolution, so you feel artificially inspired to watch the next season.After reading the reviews for the following books, I think I am going to stop here and not continue with the series. If you don't mind not having the plot advance for another 4 novels though, please feel free to read this book and the rest after it."
3,Smelly Box?,"Came quickly and the onion saver is ok. Small bubbles in the glass so it is not a fine piece of glass, but will do just fine for keeping onion remains on the kitchen counter. The box, inside a Priority Mail box, was rank with mold. I opened it in my office and I had to leave the room and let the space air out for a couple hours. I mean really, eye watering bad. I immediatly took the box ontside and layed it in the driveway for the day to let the sun do it's thing before putting in recycling."
5,Dazzle your friends,"I suppose that the only true test of a cookbook is whether or not the recipes work -- and whether or not you want to make them again. On both points this book succeeds brilliantly. Herme and Greenspan have somehow managed to make this master dessert maker's recipes accessible and -- more importantly -- workable for the home baker. The lemon tart in particular is a gem. If you're not afraid of recipes that sometimes call for a lot of steps, and you want to dazzle your friends or family with something extra-special, by all means get this book. The recipes are both fantastic and fool-proof -- and when was the last time you could say that about a dessert book?"
4,Good small tool,I like this tool except for one thing. There is no chain tool included. Having broke a chain last week and no tool to fix it I wasn't too happy. Luckily there was a guy right behind me who had one. It was the exact same thing as this tool but with a chain tool also. Something to think about.
1,Is this about American or French vegetable gardens?,"I was hoping this book would celebrate beautiful homegrown American vegetable gardens...like the kind you find by chance in a neighbor's backyard. Instead this book focused on the gardens of the rich and famous, which were mainly designed by landscape professionals, and highly influenced by the French. The pictures in this book failed to show me one vegetable garden that was truly breathtaking. Worst of all, most of the gardeners had professional assistants to maintain their gardens. This book is a waste of time and money- I absolutely hated it. Please don't waste your time or money on this book. Instead buy the House Beautiful Garden design book (on sale)...granted these gardens were also professionally designed by wealthy homeowners- they are beautiful to look at, and you can find some inspiration for your own home- plus it's much less patronizing than the Vegetable book."
2,Not too impressed,"I received this book as a gift as I am a great bargin hunter and garage sale person. I'm afraid this book was a disappointment as it showed arty photos of shabby old houses with shabby old furniture. Most people buy old things to preserve them and blend them in with their everyday life, not to accumulate a houseful of tatty old ""stuff"" and hope it is interpreted as the popular ""shabby chic"". The photography in the book is very good however."
1,Last <2 Hours,This by far wasnt' going to be my primary light but as a backup/secondary light I thought it would be great.Had it all setup and went for a short ride with my wife after work and decided to run it. We didn't make it much futher then 20 miles when she said the light wasn't on at all and when I checked on it had actually melted by top where it mounts to the tire and pushed through the side.I guess if you are going to go really slowly and not very far this might work. If you plan on going at a good clip for >1 hour it probably can't take it.
3,light set,"easy install,lights work well, a little noisy, hope it lasts as i ride every day in the predawn hours."
1,Not reliable,"Generator lights are a great idea, of course. The reasons are obvious - mostly because they don't use batteries, but also because at 6v, they put out more light than most battery lights.Unfortunately, this Bell unit is simply made too cheaply. Probably for 50 cents more, they could have made a much better product, but it is what it is. The wires are ridiculously thin and fragile. The unit itself is puny by any standards. I think some of the folks who praised this unit are impressed with the light when they first used it, but usually within one or two weeks, something shakes loose, and the unit no longer works.Nice try with a low-cost generator light, but unfortunately, this one is a dud."
1,Doesn't work and parts missing,Bought this light and found parts were missing. Went to the hardware store and bought the needed hardware and installed the light. Problem is the headlight doesn't work - called Bell and they haven't made this light since 2006 and they told me to contact Amazon for help. Now if I have to send it back I have to take it all apart and package it up and stand in line at the shipping store. What a pain for a $15 light. Not worth the trouble.
1,Lights don't last,"I've blown out 6 lights already in the SAME night, there obviously is NO voltage regulator so that is why, im really surprized because usually Bell has a decent quality product, not this time, im NOT happy with it at all."
1,Horrible Product,Stay away from this prodcut. Manual sucks...and the product is horrible....there is no way this thing is going to work.
5,Excellent map,Excellent map from Streetwise. Used maps from Streetwise in the past. Detailed information. Nicely packed into a single map. Easy to find. Easy to understand.
3,Replacement grass bags for John Deere #131405,"Bought these for my G110 lawn tractor & they don't fit properly. Had to mount them sideways to get openings to line up with the metal frame -- doesn't look too pretty, but they are working -- somewhat. Cutting & drilling out all the rivets to put these on was a royal PITA. Had to re-align everything to keep grass from blowing out of the top ( I have the optional JD power bagger, which blasts the grass in there ). These are overpriced too. Next time I'll save myself the stress & order genuine John Deere bags!!"
4,Cheaper than ordering elsewhere,"I gave them 4 stars because I think they are expensive but they are a big help so worth buying. The big chain stores were starting charge more than I could stand and I was comtemplating colored paper clips as a replacement. Amazon to the rescue. These are a big help making sure I don't miss anything when my assistant gives me paperwork or when I give it back with items marked that need her attention. They make good bookmarks, too."
5,One of the finest rock albums ever...,"Hoi Polloi's Happy Ever After truly pushed the envelope for Christian Altenative bands of their time. In the span of two years this band evolved from a mostly pop group to a formidable grunge band. Tracks like Tip Toe and Boat showed a band full of intensity, blaring guitars and tight vocals while Big Fat Happy Day was more upbeat, a track on which Jenny Gullen's vocals come across as a harder edged Gwen Stefani. Overall this is one of the best Christian grunge-alternative albums of all time"
3,An early Maigret - not his best,"This book was published in 1942 along with six other books written that year by Georges Simenon; two Maigrets and four novels. Simenon was living in Fontenay le Compte, a locale which figures in this book. It is an early Maigret novel showing the author still testing the Chief Superintendent's character, moods, his dream like analytical trances and the psychology of murderers. The confusing plot weakens in the middle and at the end when the reader is adrift to speculate on the suspect Charles Dandurand's fate. He relishes the twisted sex life of the wealthy dead spinster and her lover; much like his own. Simenon's real life distractions can be presumed; he was living in a castle in the Vendee, the Germans chopping at the fence posts, and his multi tiered personal life in temporary disarray. He, however, followed up this book with one of his strongest Maigret's roman policier, ""Maigret and the Majestic Hotel."
4,The Gooodyear Gatorback Eliminates Sound & Nice Design,"If you are looking for a belt that makes no sound and built to last, I recommend the Gooodyear Gatorback"
3,Medocre Value,"While there are undoubtedly some nice loops and one shot pieces on this disc, it's definitely overpriced compared to other material currently available. One CD (containing only 342 Mb of audio) for almost $50 is not good value."
1,Generic Junk,"Generic Junk... Can't add panniers, doesn't hold much weight & tends to shift or turn on the seatpost. Stay away from this & invest in a good bolt on rear rack. Is there a way to give zero stars?"
2,Hold out for something better!,"I bought this thinking it would be a decent cheap bike rack, which it is. My problem is the bungee cord broke and it won't hold One gallon of water without problems. It won't tighten to the seat post as much as I would like and swivels around turns.I am now going to try the Wald steel bike rack which mounts to the wheel studs and the frame. Hopefully that will be more sturdy!"
2,disappointed,"I bought this item yesterday so I could take my work/school items on my bike with me. It took over an hour to even get the thing mounted to my bike, as the hole that the seat mount goes on is too small and doesn't bend easily. I then tried to attach a bookbag to the rack if you have anything hanging over the edges the bungies won't stay hooked. The grooves need to be more of a ""hook"" type for the bungy to stay. I think this is a great idea but has some major desigm flaws. You definitely need another cargo net with SMALL hooks to attach to the metal on the rack. Next time I will splurge for a more expensive model in hopes that it is a little more user friendly."
2,Did I miss something??,"I was so enjoying yet another Stapleton/ Montgomery mystery and enjoy it I did. However, I was very disappointed that Robin Cook did not explore the end of the relationship Laurie had with Paul Sutherland. It just petered out without an ending (ergo.. Did I miss something).I haven't felt this in your other novels.. What's up DOC?"
4,Bravo,"I think that Jack and Laurie are two of Mr. Cook's best created characters. When I found yet another book featuring them, I was ecstatic, and I wasn't disappointed. I can't wait for another with them included."
3,coincedences galore,"This novel is a good quick read. It was amazing though, in the big city of New York, how often when something major happened to a character, that person just happened to be related to a good friend of the main character Jack. If that was not the case, this story collapses. I find that just a little to hard to swallow to make this a great book. The story doesn't flow but feels 'set up' because of all the coincedences involved in the unraveling of the plot line."
3,Parallel between Cook/Preston,"Just a quick comment. I've just finished reading ""Cobra Event"" by Richard Preston. When reading the synopsis for ""Vector,"" I thought I was reading the description of ""Cobra Event."" The storylines are basically identical (psychotic disgruntled foreign doctor threatens NYCity and the rest of the world with a genetically altered virus). I enjoy reading both authors novels, but please, I don't enjoy reading the same book twice."
3,Interesting read but a little far fetched,"This is the first time I read a Robin Cook thriller and must admit I was glued to it for the most part. It's amazing that his bio-weapon attack scenario is not as bizarre, post 9-11 and this book was conceived much before that.But the situations are sometimes too far-fetched that you cannot help thinking, ""C'mon, gimme a break!"". Filled with too many cliches and the plot and caharcters appear too ""Nancy Drewish"" to be taken seriously :)But nevertheless it's worth a read and the ending has a ""twist"" that would surely add to the experience..."
1,"Pure, unadulterated CRAP!!","Hard to believe this was written by Robin Cook. Protagonists are nothing but politically-correct nitwits, villians are one-dimensional, and plot is completely unbelievable. Entire novel is suffused with politically-correct mantras. Continues the decline in the quality of Cook's literary work. Very dissappointing!"
2,"OK, but not great.","I was expecting to get a lot more out of this book then I did due to the author's background at NeXT. I found it to read very easily and explain things clearly but not things that I really wanted to know. This book should of been the first 3 chapters of a cocoa book in my opinon, and about 150 pages shorter. The author went overly into basic details, and did not provide enough tech details. Well I guess that's what I get for not buying oreilly though."
1,Skimps on details,"If I could I would have given this book zero stars, but at least the publisher used recycled paper. The author briefly covers Objective-C, but doesn't delve very well into the differences between Objective-C and C/C++, Java or for that matter SmallTalk (on whose syntax Objective-C is based). That is my biggest gripe. Objective-C is C in name only. There was no discussion of the pitfalls of Objective-C. I had to dig on the net to find out you can't create Objective-C objects on the stack. I would be reading the book and be thinking about how I would solve a particular problem in a different language, and there would be no discussion along those lines. You can program in Java to create a Cocoa app, and Apple provides its tutorial to get a programmer going, but the author actually tries to dissuage his readers from using Java. It doesn't even serve as any sort of proper Cocoa API reference. I guess I'll just stick with Apple's documentation."
5,Fabulous for anyone with less-than-recent experience,"I came into this book from the standpoint of a long time ago having done some degree of programming in Java and a larger degree in C and other languages, carrying a basic understanding of object oriented programming, never having done Mac development. I'm 1/3 through this book and am finding it just about perfect. From little things like a quick reminder of what @ means in C (yes, it has been a while), to very good work-through examples and effective textbook-style 'challenges' at the end of each chapter. This book is far superior to 'Learning Cocoa'. Buy it."
3,not what I pictured it to be,small and hard to use but this was my fault- to small to put notes on it for employees .
5,What More to Say?,"Perfect accessory for any desk, great starter item for my son's converted man cave desk, really cannot be beaten and serves purpose well"
1,TERRIBLE PRICE FROM AMAZON,Needed something to get to $25 for free shipping. Description did not say how many sheets in a pad. I would have guessed 100 or more per pad. Turns out there are only 50 per pad. Interesting the the picture also blanks out the description on the bottom of the pack that gave this information. DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON AT THE $3.99 PRICE. You can get two or three times the number of sheets for half the price elsewhere.
4,"Great movie, even better soundtrack!","This is still a great CD, fifteen years hasn't done anything to age it. Do NOT play this CD in your car as it will probably get you a speeding ticket. I can't decide which WANG album is better: Mosaic, Warmer side, or this one."
5,The music drives the movie,"To Live and Die in LA is one of those little sleeper movies that never fail to impress on repeated viewings. In no small way, the music of Wang Chung drives the mood, the excitement, the corruption, the ethos of LA. Particularly impressive is the City of the Angels track- which propels the action in high octane moments, with its simple driving beat and appealing riff. Pity Wang Chung never did anything else of interest, but this soundtrack is their little gem."
1,not what i thought but hey,"i bought this under the assumption that i was getting a device that would allow me to extend my monitor so that i could work on two different projects on two different screens not the same thing on both, but that was not the case. i guess i should have did my homework better rather than wasting the money i spent on it, but its fine ill just have to take my bussiness elsewhere."
3,SAME GRIP PICK,"Is very infact slippery,has the same amount of grip as my S&B; Pick even while my hands are a little sweaty.I was very disappointed with these picks as i thought it would give me more of a grip, but in fact turned out to be the same as my other picks with no grip.The are only scratches on the pick which would only help ifyou held the pick with your fore fingers, but the pick is not held that way.It is held with the side of your fore finger (or whatever your comfortable with, this is just the way i hold it), and the thumb on the side for support.Overall,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT."
3,Japanese manga inspiration??,"First of all, I want to say that I haven't watched the series yet. But what really surprised me it's the premise: two people helping each other from both sides of the law... It's exactly the same that ""Sanctuary"" a japanese manga (comic book) from author Ryoichi Ikegami (story by Sho Fumimura). It was a bestseller in Japan and some real action and anime films were made. It was about two friends that had shared a harsh infancy, and decide to gain control of the country's powers and then help each other: one will join the yakuza to become the national mob boss and the other will get into politics to became Japan's president. Shhiver!! I just wanted to point out these similarities. Does anybody know if this series is in fact based in ""Sanctuary""?"
3,ON DEMAND,"I found this series to be mildly interesting. Not really great tv. Can't understand the motivation for some of the characters. Does not compare to The Wire, Sopranos, Luther or Boardwalk Empire. But it is better than House of Borgia. It's something to click 'on demand' when you're having a boring day and there is nothing else to watch."
2,Not Worth Watching,"I watched 3 episodes, trying to find a reason for watching at least the first season. I couldn't find one. I usually like some type of interesting tension: the criminals with a loving family life, the rogue cop trying to maintain a semblance of justice, elected officials caught between the needs for election versus service.This series had nothing I could get interested in. There was absolutely no moral compass. There was nothing to tie the events together. There was no real story line. There was no question or dilemma to think about. In a word, the series was simply boring, uninteresting, and unenlightening."
2,Get it as a curiosity piece or if you speak fluent French,"If you are curious what exactly ""les Mis"" sounded like in the original language of Victor Hugo, and how the lyrics & score changed so much when it went to London & beyond, then get this. Otherwise, the voices are not very good, and the fluent French sounds very harsh to our ears. The orchestrations are quite good, but you're much better off vocally by getting the OLC or the TAC."
5,incisive; fascinating,I picked this book up as a lark but stayed with it -- it's meaty enough to intrigue but serious enough to inform. an excellent and fair job by another great woman
4,Biography or Novel?,"This book reads like a novel! I found it interesting and hard to put down. I enjoyed it and learned alot more about Hillary Clinton. I admire her for her intellect, determination, skill, and her presence and power as an American woman. She truly inspires me, although I am not sure that I can trust her. I question her ethics and whether her mission is for the good of the people of NY or the good for HER. This book has helped me to think more about her and whether or not I want to elect her to be my next senator.An overall good book that gets you thinking."
1,This is old stuff,Save your money. This is just more I love Hillary talk. I am not a Hillary fan but I read this hoping to gain some insight into her character. Nothing new here. Nothing insightfull
2,"Based on hearsay, opinion, and ""psycho-analysis""","This book lacked depth and seemed to be based largely on hearsay and opinion of key people interviewed by the author. At several points, the author even asked some interviewees to comment on what they thought Hillary and/or Bill Clinton were ""feeling."" There are several attempts at a ""psychoanalysis"" of the Clintons, which would have been fine if this was a psychology book written by a psychologist, but doesn't work here at all. With any biography, I question the level of accuracy and also realize that much needs to be based on judgement or interpretation of fact; this book did not seem to present much information based on fact but rather more on unexamined opinion. Overall, a disappointing book."
5,Fantastic Sweeper Magnet,"This product is much better than wheeled models.it picks up nails from the ground, gravel, and grass yards in cases you would not believe.Magnet is powerful and the product is very durably constructed and almost indestructable.After a roofing job, this sweeper removed about three pounds of nails left by the roofing crew, who did sweep with a wheeled sweep."
2,Disorganized and disappointing,"The problem with Mr. Di Salvatore's book is that it never seems to decide what it wants to be. At times, it attempts to study Ward in the context of his time--and, indeed, it spends more time on his youth in Bellefonte and his brief time at Penn State than it does with his involvement in the players' movement and his marriage to Helen Dauvray--while at other times it seems to want to break into a full-fledged novel. The chronology is equally inconsistent, and he varies between giving too little detail (e.g., the Players' League) in some areas and unconscionable amounts--there is a full section on the history of baseball that adds little or nothing to the book as a whole--in others. By failing to establish some central theme or organizing principle for the book, Mr. Di Salvatore comes perilously close to writing about nothing at all."
5,More than just a biography for baseball history buffs,"A Clever Base-Ballist: The Life And Times Of John Montgomery Ward is the riveting tale of John Montgomery Ward's life and historical baseball career, from his expulsion from Penn State University for stealing chickens, to pitching baseball's second perfect game in 1880, to becoming a member of the New York Giants. More than just a biography for baseball history buffs, A Clever Base-Ballist also paints a bright, engaging picture of American life at the turn of the century. For baseball enthusiasts and millennium enthusiasts alike, A Clever Base-Ballist does not disappoint!"
4,Fun Beach Book,"Pagan Babies is a great beach book. It's short, tongue-in-cheek and always entertaining. It presents us with an off-the-wall plot that never stops taking twists and turns in every which way.What I like about Leonard is the skill with which he writes dialogue. His novels are usually 90% dialogue; he is a master at giving each character a distinct voice and feel. And his dialogue is always very sarcastic. I found myself laughing more than once at the way the characters talked and acted.A scam plot like this one needs to be believable in order to work. Here, you have a pretend priest and a woman who wants to scam a quarter million out of a rich mob boaa. The plot is highly entertaining and very funny. The novel is very straight to the point. It is genuine Leonard and it would make a great movie! It seems to me that Leonard keeps getting better with time. I, for one, awaits his next book with great anticipation!"
2,Never got on track,"This is the perfect example of a good writer taking a serious misstep, but because he is so good the story still occasionally works. I am not going to review the story, that has been done here many times, but I will give my opinion of the novel.I think the story was forced and contrived, but the humor and sheer ridiculousness of the story keeps the reader reading. Also, the story is so strange but decently written you keep thinking that it will get better eventually. Well, it doesn't. This is not to say that it is a terrible book, not at all, but it is not a great book. Hell, it is barely a good book, but it does have its moments. I would suggest anything else, unless you have read everything else."
1,Do not recommend,"This book started out well, and the story became engrossing by the middle of the book, but all went down hill from there--I did not care for the ending on this book at all. I was very disappointed."
4,The Ugly American with a conscience?,"This novel is my fourth by Elmore Leonard: I have a great admiration for his style and ability as a writer. This one in characterizations resembles""Get Shorty"". He sort of has the decadence of modern America where priests, lawyers, Gangsters and police seem to leave ordinary people very littleof the pie. The anti-hero is a man who pretends to be a priest, but is actually a small time hood. He runs into the rule that you sometimes become what you are pretending to be, while falling for a female stand-up comedian who is also a tough semi-hood who works for lawyers.Money for the orphans comes between them..."
3,Uncomfortably enjoyable,"Let me first say that I love Elmore Leonard on principle. I enjoy the pacing and the humanization of his characters, regardless of where they fall in the moral spectrum. That said, I was intrigued by the plot involving the genocidal activity in Rwanda. Leonard was careful to keep the genocidal activity comedy free, although you couldn't help but feel undomfortable from page one through the end. It is a well crafted book, with several engrossing passages, and the typical Elmore Leonard dialogue, rife with witticisms, but the utterly depressing backdrop is a bit much to deal with. Read with caution"
4,An Entertaining Romp,"""Pagan Babies"" is the first novel I've read by Elmore Leonard, but it is probably one of the better books I've read this year. I am frequently disappointed by modern fiction, and I am glad to say that while this book didn't challenge me or make me say ""wow"", it was in no way disappointing. It was a smooth, easy read that accentuated what I gather to be Leonard's trademark writing style. It's true that the story was predictable and in some ways overworked, but Leonard's treatment makes it worth the read, especially if you've been spending a lot of time lately (as I have) reading novels by authors who try far too hard to make their work appear profound or smart. I agree a bit with some of the prior reviews that this might make a better movie than it did a book."
2,Not a Bust but Not Great,"Elmore Leonard has come to attract a certain audience and to create certain expectation. In Pagan Babies, Leonard has fallen from the lofty expectations that have established him as an icon of the action read. In this work, Leonard appears to have lost his way and seems to be operating on fumes rather than the racy and substantiative material in past works. I mean, I love novels with big breasts and sex scenes but do we need a piece of fiction that would cause a corpse to to do push-ups on a December day in Fargo? And what does that have to do with the storyline? Lamentably, Leonard has reverted to easy sleaze and the result is sex, sex, sex.For those still interested, it's a busty book with testosterone oozing from its pages, while every woman has an implant and the men seem to have no interest in moving the plot forward. In short, I think its shallow but worth a little steam. Leonard, however, seems to have little steam left."
5,brave women,I like this story on brave women at a time when women were considered weak. Also the reverse roles of the men and women.
3,Experimental rock from Brazil,"This is the third album from Brazilian rock musician Oswaldo Montenegro. Released in 1980, it features a mix of regional Brazilian styles, rock and avant garde experimentalism. Fans of Milton nascimento or Lo Borges might also like this record, though the average listener might find it difficult to get into..."
5,Great Read. a little biased,"AN excellent book to read, I really enjoyed reading what the Russian sailors had to tolerate and I am glad that part of our history is over.This book does a reasonably good job, in revisiting the Cuban crisis.Most definitely not a Tom Clancy book, but a good read never the less.It would have been a lot better had it also described what the enlisted personnel went through o both sides, as officers in both navies tend to think they actually run the ships. They pass the orders yes, run the ships how??.No doubt though this book is a great read especially for its historical revelations."
4,Pointy Headed Baseball Musings,Gould was a great baseball fan. His writings about what it was like to grow up in New York City during the 50's are wonderful. The true gem of gems in this collection of essays deals with the history and rules of stickball.He describes himself as a pointy-headed intellectual and it's clear from this book he is. The writings are often tainted by politics and it's not easy reading for the average joe. However I would recommend this book to any hardcore baseball fan.
2,Expired Film,"We weren't told that the film we ordered was about to expire. While we know this type of film is not in demand, and therefore not produced anymore, we still would have appreciated some indication on the site that the film was about to expire, and/or how long the film is good for after expiration. Smarmy."
3,Poloroid 600 film,We were happy to find the film through AMAZON and in our haste to order it failed to consider that it might be old.So the pictures are fuzzy. I will say that it was packaged excellantly and got here quickly. It is not the sellers fault that it is old and we have no difficulty there. The difficulty is with the planned obsolescence of our cameras and rendering them nearly useless and throw away-able.
1,answers,I could not get a response from customer service after four days. I was very interested in the printer but no one can seem to answer my simple question.
4,Very worthwhile read!,Sons and Brothers was an outstanding read. This was a very non-bias account of Jack and Bobby Kennedy's whirlwind ride through arguably the most turbulent times in our nations History.
2,I heard better things,"I was overall really disappointed in this product from multiple viewpoints. First, and this may just be me, I found the volume to be very low even at the highest setting. Maybe I listened to way to much Judas Priest as a youth, but even when pressing it into my ear, I was not able to hear well. Second, the fit was very hard to get right. Even with the multiple ear clips and ear pieces, it always felt that the Jawbone was falling out. I passed it along to another person I work with and will see if he likes it any better."
2,hard to get good transmit sound,"The unit looks good, but is hard to operate. It's very sensitive to placement on the user's face. Unless you get it just so, the transmit sound is squawky and edgy. Bluetooth compatibility with Palm Treo 680 only so-so. On balance, a disappointment."
3,Not too bad.,the sound quality in noises area was not as expected and the way they advertised to it.
2,"Great outgoing sound, poor fit","Outgoing sound quality is great -- people thought I wasn't on my cell phone. Incoming sound quality is poor -- I never could turn the volume up enough (on headset and phone) to hear properly. Fit was very bad -- no matter what I tried, I could not get it to stay on my ear -- it kept falling off. Technologically, this unit is almost dangerous -- one time when I pushed the volume button, my phone (Moto Pebl) crashed (I wouldn't have believed it could happen, except I was there). After getting my phone restarted, I packed up the Jawbone, and I'm now looking for another option."
1,Unreliable product,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my son. He charged and sync'd it with his IPhone and for about an hour it worked. For the next two days, he would be in the middle of a conversation and it would drop. We would be talking and then there would just be nothing until he could switch his phone off of the bluetooth setting. The headset looks high-tech but just would not work. I also could not find any troubleshooting tips on the web. He called Aliph and got no help what-so-ever. This has been returned to Amazon."
2,Don't waste your money,"Promised a lot -- just didn't deliver! Yea, it looks great on your ear, but the sound coming into your ear is more like a tin can. There are much better choices that are much cheaper!"
4,Very good headset,"I think this is the best bluetooth headset I've owned, but I still won't give it 5 stars. Here's my overall impressions of it:- Best sound quality for headsets out there, bar none.- Some power pin problems when connector power plug. I've had to get an RMA unit for this reason- I understand why there isnt two power on/off buttons, but I wish there was a volume up/down button. Bluetooth allows my to hide my cell phone in my pocket. The one touch volume adjustment the Jawbone has isnt enough for me, so another small beef.That being said, I'm sure they will continue to improve this product and make it better and then maybe I will give it 5 stars."
1,Decent. But Doesnt Live up to its hype.,"Bought this thing on amazon after hearing the great reviews on Noise canceling.I found that while it does a great job at canceling noise, and the person on the other end can hear clearly, I have been having a hard time hearing at my end of the conversation with even a moderate level of noise.Hope this is helpful."
4,Cuts out background noise,"My husband is a truck driver so it is important to use a hands free device that cuts out background noise. This is his second Jawbone and it works great. Thank you Amazon, for making it so easy and quick to buy something that actually works great, at a good price!"
4,Very good headset for loud situations,"Purchased for my father, it was simple to pair with his LG phone. Good noise reduction in a loud engine situations. Had used two other headsets before this which were not satisfactory for the truck driving environment, he has even said that it is lighter on the ear than the other two. Comes with customizable ear buds and ear hooks to provide a better fit. No real negatives about this product so far. Purchased during Amazon's after Thanksgiving sale so the price was quite good."
2,Jawbone review,"I really wanted to like this bluetooth device as I need a good one for all of my calls, particularly while driving. I have never been able to get it to fit my ear (either side). I have tried all of the ear pieces and loops but none will stay in my ear. The noise reduction works well but if the earpiece won't stay in your ear it is pretty useless as there is too much noise getting in to hear your call. The charging connection has broken and was very sensitive to positioning. This was a waste of good money as I bought it when it was new and paid dearly for it."
1,sucks,"HUGE disappointment. This was a very expensive bluetooth, and it sucked. The ear loop broke, the rubber ear inserts never stayed on. Just flat out SUCKED!"
2,Jawbone Poor Sound Quality,"I ordered several of the top rated bluetooth headsets to find the best. I also ordered some Jabra ear gels as someone had written that they can help the fit on some headset. It looks good and I really wanted to like the Jawbone. Unfortunately, it did not work out that way. I found the earloop wasn't snug enough. The ear insert was somewhat comfortable, but not my favorite. The sound quality on my end was good, but those on the other end of the line complained of terrible crackling. So, this one went back."
1,No volume,I am very disappointed with the jawbone -- very difficult to hear even when set to the highest volume on the phone and the headset. Very uncomfortable and difficult to wear. An extremely awkward and expensive device.
3,Static and Problems,"For the money you pay for this headset you would assume the sound quality would be clear. However, many consumers including myself have problems with hearing static. The static comes and goes, but the static exists more often then not. I fell into the hype behind this headset and though they are not horrible, they are certainly disappointing. If you haven't purchased this headset yet, then save your money."
2,doesn't sit well,"Doesn't sit comformably on the ear. It does a ok job of blocking background noise, but the rest of the design is lacking. The ear cover doesn't stay on the headpiece."
2,"OK Earpiece... WAAAY Overpriced, not Durable!","When I got this earpiece, I was in my IKEA, APPLE, gotta be trendy phase, that I should have had a brain, but hey, I only human! LOL.... Just kidding, but seriously, this earpiece sounded okay. the noise reduction was no better than any other noise reduction on a 40 or 50 dolar bluetooth earpiece. At the time I purchased it for around 80 or 90 bucks, I cant remember. The ear loops that hold it on you ear kept breaking and they are expensive in my opinion. You really had to bend them to get a good grip on your ear. This brings me to my next point, when it does fall off, your ear, which it will the ear bud piece comes off alot, so much in fact that I eventually had to use super glue to fix it. All thins considered, these complaints could happen with any other earpiece as well, only thing is other ear pieces are cheaper in price that do these things. It does LOOK COOL though!!"
3,Beautiful design...average at best otherwise.,"Lot of reviews so I am not going to go into the detail...but in a nutshell,--loses connection with iPhone 3G--loudest volume is lower that sometimes wanted--the person you are talking to often gets frustrated by the quality...if the ""sensor"" is not touching your cheek, the microphone is not on....--pretty comfortable--pretty good battery life"
2,Noise Quality,People I call complain about background noises and hearing echos of their own voice. I end up either taking the headset off or turning it off to improve call quality and to not annoy the person I am calling. I'm not sure what the noise shield mentioned in the name of the unit is really suppose to do but my last earpiece was much clearer and I had less complaints from the people I was talking to. I'm not satisfied with this item.
1,Defective and didn't fit,"Positives: Good sound quality both coming in and going out, AttractiveNegatives: The device arrived with a defective casing that kept falling off. Even with all of the options given, I was unable to find a comfortable fit in my ear canal. I think this was in part due tho the relatively (to other competitive units) bulky and heavy design of the Jawbone. I returned the device, got my money back and bought a Motorola H2 with a smaller size and better fit that work well for me."
3,"Good, but fails where it should shine","This headset is without a doubt partly a piece of jewelry. It looks great, feels great, and works, well, just ok. You see, I suppose it depends what you want from a headset.Now, some people complain about the quality of the item, saying that this and that are plastic and such. This is a headset, it should without a doubt, be made of plastic for weight purposes.The headset sounds great, works well, is VERY comfortable, range is just so-so, but here is the simple problem with the product:It doesn't work well (basically, it doesn't work at all) with wind. Even tiny gusts of wind make my voice almost inaudible to the other caller. I can hear them very well, but this is just unacceptable for one of the most expensive on the market.I am going to test the plantronics 510 next, hopefully with better results. If I don't get what I am looking for, Samsung WEP 200, here I come. If I want mediocre performance, I will go with the smallest of the bunch."
1,Terrible sound quality for transmitting,"Sound quality was fine on my end, but terrible on the other side (from my iPhone - and when I switched back and forth to the phone itself, quality problems went away, so it's definitely the headset). I rate this headset as ""useless junk,"" unfortunately."
2,Tried for almost an hour but could not get it to fit,"After trying for close to an hour to make it fit comfortably over the ear, I gave up and returned the unit without even turning it on."
3,Nice Bluetooth,"This was a gift, it seems to work well, but it arrived late and with no instruction manual. I helped the gift recipient download instructions for the pairing on the web. After the initial embarrassment it does seem to work well."
1,"Poor product, worse customer support","I bought the Jawbone a couple of months ago and paired it to a Blackberry Curve 8300. The noise reduction does work well, though listeners complain that the DSP introduces a mechanical quality to the call.A worse problem is that when you tell the Blackberry to take the call at the handset via the menu choice ""Activate Handset"" when receiving the call, about 10-15 seconds later the Jawbone grabs the call again. If its in your pocket, that's a problem.I contacted support twice and they told me to reset and re-pair the units, which I did. No fix. Then they told me it doesn't happen. I've talked to several other Curve and 8800 owners who have the same problem. I've put mine away and gone back to the Plantronics ... it works correctly and its much easier to put on anyway."
3,fact or hype?,"Saw the product reviews on the site, I was definitely expecting a little more. I've tried making calls in crowded places, open windows while driving, radio on etc... Its not that the technology does not work, but not as stated on the site.Also, there is a small piece of plastic that is protuding out that has to be in contact with your face for the noise cancellation to work. Its sometimes rather tough to get the angle(contact) right.Overall, I'll rate is 7/10."
1,I like Plantronics much better!,"I decided to try the competition after my Plantronics blue tooth got wet and stopped working. The Jaw Bone noise cancelling model I bought performed its basic function (it was pretty good in wind), but execution is awful. None of the ear pieces fit my ear (it kept falling out), and when I received a call, the process of placing it in my ear ended the call no matter how careful I was (the only way to push it into your ear pushes the button that ends the call). My experience causes me to be a very loyal Plantronics customer."
1,Marginal at best,"This thing has two pretty major flaws. First, it only cancels some noises, but it seems to amplify wind noise. Second, the charging method is poorly designed. Not only does it take a special charge adapter (vs. the mini-USB plug used by most devices), the charge adaptor actually broke the housing about the fourth time I used it. So now I have an expensive device that is glued back together and doesn't perform to my expectations. I actually prefer the bottom end Motorola blue-tooth device that came in the package deal with my phone."
3,Technology-based product; not fashionable but very effective,"While this product uses military technology in background noise elimination, it has cons. It is solely invented for what is advertised as, clarity. It is big, unfashionable, not trendy, fragile, and what annoyed me the most was how it would often fall off my ear. Not really worth the money. But it will silence the background. However I found it difficult to hear what the person on the other end of the phone (or bluetooth) was saying. In my mind that is a lot of money to have a huge, unfashionable, cheaply constructed plastic bluetooth. I lost it but I got some other type of bluetooth. It fits in my ear much better. No more holding my ear like an agent in the matrix to make sure it stays in...But overall it has good battery life so I had to give it 3 stars instead of 2..."
2,Poor Sound Level,"I spent many hours researching the latest and greatest of blue tooth headsets and chose this one based on perceived quality. Price was not a big issue. It is very lightweight which was great. Easy to use as well. The biggest problem was the sound level. You can hear the caller if you are in a quiet place. However, as soon as the level of noise increased in the area you are calling it becomes very difficult to hear. I think the problem is the ear piece. It does not go into the ear, but rather sits on the outside. I have a Plantronics 510 and it worked with my older phone very well. it has an earpiece that goes into the ear and you can set the volume much higher. I only switched because I was getting a lot of static in the headset with the new phone (3G technology may be the issue...I dont know). I would not recommend this headset to anyone working in a potentially noisy environement (driving with the windows open, walking outside, etc)"
4,"Great sound, could have a tighter fit","I have been using the Jawbone for several weeks now and love it. The sound quality is fantastic, most people can't tell I'm on my cell phone. When the car window is down, it doesn't do as good a job with wind noise, but otherwise it is great, I can even talk very softly and have it pick it up perfectly."
1,"filters out voice, not noise","I am sure it works wonders for most ppl, but apparently if you have sideburns, this headset is not for you. it has to sit right against your cheekbone and touch it to sense the vibrations. if something gets between, say sideburns, this headset is worse than anything i have ever heard. always try before you buy."
3,Bluetootrh Headset,"The Jawbone Bluetooth headset is a very good headset to have when driving the sound come out very clear, but i don't no what the purchaseof the noise shield I've tried it but it makes the volume low.I think they should have made the part that goes around you ear plastic and I say that because when I'm not using it I put in my pocket, and I bend it sometimes that has cause me to buy extra hear part from Jawbone, that I would not have to do if it was plastic and that is something they should look into and Jawbone should also (ANSWER) your emails when you send them. But on a scale of 1 to10 I would give it a 8"
2,Good product but over-hyped,"I purchased the Jawbone to replace a couple of older Motorola headsets for a Moto phone. I thought the headset might perform better in a noisy environment like being in my moving convertible. It does a better job but only for noise that has a steady pattern, like the lawn mower in Aliph's videos. If you are listening to your radio and a loud song is playing, the Jawbone is only a little better than the others. Other reviewers complain about how it fits the ear and the ""tinny"" sound...all true. What I found is that my phone has a harder time understanding my voice commands with the Jawbone than with the Motorola headset or any other Bluetooth headset for that matter. I might be too fussy, but for 2 times the price of a comparable headset I'd at least like to to perform as well."
4,Making it fit your ear,I out it on and try calling from outdoors on a very windy day. The person on the other end couldn't hear me. I was very down thinking I bought another piece of garbage. I read the directions and found out that there is a white knob on the end that has to be in contact with your face. So after 4 trys and finally bending one of the supplied ear loops to fit my ear properly i got it perfect. I then made a call again from a noisy place and it was amazing. The noise reduction was awesome and I had no problem hearing even in a crowded noisy environment. And on the other end my friend was so impressed he bought one to. So the moral to the story is it's worth the fight to get it to fit the end result justifies the struggle.
3,not bad,The sound quality is much better than my first bluetooth however the one annoying thing is that it has trouble linking up with the phone sometimes and I have to turn the phone off and then on again to get it to connect. I should just need to tap the bluetooth button. This is a very annoying drawback that would make me think twice about getting this item. It may just be an issue with compatibility to my phone....an LG EnV.
1,Total Junk,"The charger cable wouldn't stay put right out of the box .. it kept popping out of the end of the unit. I have to wrap an elastic band around it to keep it in place. I filled in the on-line request for customer service 3 times before finally getting a response. They promised to send me a new charger 4 weeks ago, and it still hasn't arrived (I'm sure it never will). At one week old, the earpiece totally detached from the unit ... so I glued it back on. Given the lousy construction and quality control, as well as the horrid customer support ... I would NEVER buy anything from this company again.Lastly .. the unit is very tinny sounding compared to the dozen or so BT units I've used over the years. Since I rarely talk on the phone while using a chainsaw or leaf blower, I care what the unit sounds like on MY end as well as the other party."
5,Alliph Jawbone Bluetooh Headset,This is a great product...the noise cancelling is superb...the sound quality is excellent at both ends. I use it with the Jabra Clear Ear Gels and get a secure fit that allows me to use the Jawbone without the ear loops.
4,Good sound quality. Poor fit.,"The Jawbone does have very good sound. It captures my voice well and also plays incoming voices well. Absolutely no sounds problems. I never did get it to fit. I lost it once because it fell off. I've tried adjusting it. I may try giving it to a guy friend or family member as their ears are larger. I use the BlueAnt Z9, it fits, also perfect sound, and half the size."
1,Aliph Jawbone Not a Good Option,"I bought the Aliph Jaywone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset, because on all the stores and reviews told it was the best.Sound quality sucks and if you are in a place where there is a lot of people, like and airport or office, you won't be able to hear anything.I regret I spent money on this."
1,Big bluetooth,"the item is not like the picture, it's to big... i was trying to return it but i have a question before I do that... I used $35.00 gift card...if I return the item am I getting my gift card back?????"
2,Poor design...great audio though!,"This is not designed to be worn by anyone who has ""feeling"" in the ear! If you have a wooded ear just glue it to ear or just glue it to the side of your head.....I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but more troubles fitting it. The electronics are all good but I cannot wear it for more than 1 hour a day. This item has been re-designed, for said reasons, why are they still selling this ""original"" design with constant complaints? They will keep your money and refuse to refund, I know this from experience...welcome to China."
5,One of the half-dozen best cd's of the 80's,"The measure of how good this disc is, is in how disappointing Maria McKee's output has been since its release. At various times, she seemed to have decided to ""be"" Bruce Springsteen, U2 or to have adopted similarly ill-advised musical role models. The irony is that, with ""Lone Justice"" she broke on the scene with a fully-developed musical identity of her own, based on great songwriting, top-flight production and a voice like a Force of Nature. This album screamed out ""Maria McKee has ARRIVED"". In a perfect world, every song here would have been a #1 single. Years later, none of that original power is diminished. It's a shame that none of the discs she's made since have retained this kind of focus."
3,Intriguing insight into this age-old Bible story,"Although not nearly as in-depth as a similar program produced by National Geographic (""Cain and Abel: Brothers At War""), nevertheless, the interviewees present some sound, intriguing insights into this brief yet far-reaching story of the first murder, between brothers. My preference (and thus only 3 stars) is for the National Geographic program, though, as relevant texts (including apocryphal and traditional)from Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are brought into the discussion to shed light on the subject in the NG approach. However, the NG program is not yet available on video or DVD, and can only be seen on NG's broadcast channel; it's well worth the trouble."
4,"A fascinating, complex story","Although Summer Queen lacks the mythic structure which lent such power to Vinge's Snow Queen, it is an expertly written ""social science fiction"" exploration of colonialism, as well as an appealing story about characters worth caring about.The characters who were young and simple in Snow Queen have grown up, and grown more complex in their view of the world. Vinge also develops the political situation on Tiamaat in more complexity. The world she develops is believable. Her best characters struggle heroically to do the right thing, but are often hampered by the need to compromise with more powerful military, cultural, or economic forces--just like real revolutionaries, visionaries, and leaders. I'm impressed by the depth of political consciousness Vinge brings to this story."
3,Easy Listening,"I had intended on remastering this myself as I have both Easy Street and Under the Glass by Easy Street. I thought that they would never release this on CD so the LP has been sitting next to my computer for about 4 months. Then one day I did a search on Amazon and presto, there they were. They never made it commercially. Despite there being some very interesting music on these two releases. It's not a remaster but Renaissance did a good job of re-issuing the product. My only quibble is that there are only 20 tracks and not 21 as the liner notes show. I gave this only 3 stars because most people have no clue to whom Easy Street was. This is excellent material to just sit down and relax to. Especially Easy Street itself. There are some strong lyrics too."
2,kinda nice but dissappointed,this was the first cd i bought. i once had a friend who would work iwth me with guided meditation. she had a pleasent voice. but there was no music through out. it started with music but then it stopped. but it was calming. but then when it go into the second part there was LOUD music and it startled me and woke me out of the calm i was in and then it was dull. i like music in the background.
3,Pentax K100D with 18-55mm lens,"I am disappointed with this camera, but most of it is my fault for not adequately researching it. First, the 18-55 lens is not a good choice. One should have some wide angle (the 18) for indoor close shots. However, having no telephoto (the 55) borders on stupid. I understood that I could use my older Pentax lens, a 35-70 and a 50-200, but I did not understand that they would not work with the auto focus feature. I most likely will have to buy a 18-200 auto focus Tamron lens to be satisfied with my needs, because Pentax does not have an equivalent. I think the camera, itself, is o.k. llb"
4,Bcube,"I got this machine just before the holidays and it is just great. I've had a Pentax MX and all my old lenses, extender and filters fit just fine. You just have to use it in manual or apperture priority mode. It got tested quite extensively during this new year's firework displays and returned stunning shots. Imagine seeing your shots right after you take them instead of hoping for the best with film slrs. The only problem is the long time it takes to load a night shot like the time exposure for the fireworks. I guess I lost roughly 30% of shots I would have taken with film. But over all it performs very well. Next on my wish list is a dedicated flash for this unit."
3,A Great Read!!,"On the verge of 30, married, and childless (for now), I thought this book would be something I would like. My instinct was correct!! This is a great book both for women who don't yet have any children (but are considering it) and for women who are just starting a family. (You will know what I mean once you start reading it!) I laughed and laughed. This read goes fast and is guaranteed to keep you guessing and smiling all the way through."
2,Don't Fit Can't Adjust Terrible,"This product lasted for about 3 seconds before it was back in its box. I can't even comment on the quality of sound, to me if it doesn't wear well then nothing else matters one bit. I have a rather large melon as it is and these suckers were so wide they almost appeared to be defective. However, many many reviews have confirmed my thoughts. The entire top 1/4 diameter were gaping off of my ears and head. Why they would make these without adjustments is what I couldn't wrap my head around, literally. I love the concept but they just don't cut mustard. I highly recommend trying to find a place where you can demo these before you purchase. Fees to return them are just not worth the gamble. AND I hate waiting on another pair. Grrrrrr"
2,Extremely large...,"I purchased these headphones around Feb. of 2007. I would rate them much higher, except I really didn't get to use them very much due to their extreme size. I'm not certain if I received a defective pair, but when I opened the product and attempted to put them on my head, they were SO big that they fell off my head every time I would put them on. Since there is no manual adjustment to make the headphones fit snug to your head, they don't fit comfortably at all.The sound quality on the headphones is excellent, but the headphones themselves are poorly designed. If you like comfort, don't buy these headphones. They're NOT comfortable due to the size.However, if you're a teenager and you like listening to music with a friend while both of you have your heads side-by-side, the headphones are plenty large enough to accomidate you. Or if you're a zookeeper and you like to let your elephants or hippos listen to music, these headphones will fit them nicely."
1,You need a really big head,"Have these and immediately noticed that there was no way these would ever fit properly on my head. All of the positive reviewers can't possibly have heads that are big enough to fit these - can they? Someone mentioned ""pumpkin head"" and I believe that would be right, they do fit properly on a pumpkin for Halloween. Unfortunately I can't comment on sound quality because headphones really need to fit properly before they can be reviewed."
5,Amazing! No more sweaty ears!,"I have a set of Audio Technica ATH-M40fs studio headphones that sound amazing, but I can't wear them for too long because my ears ... start sweating.I got these open air headphones and they are awesome. They are huge, but fit very comfortably and no more sweaty ears!Some reviews complained that they are too big. I fixed that by bending the two wires on top. It was very easy to adjust and now I have the perfect work headphones.These are open air headphones so there is some sound spillage (you can hear what I'm listening to), which is not an issue because I have my own office. If you work with other people next to you, this might not be appropriate.It's also nice that you can hear if someone starts talking to you because the headphones let some sounds in, but are isolated enough to fully enjoy the music.I go as far as saying that these are the best set of headphones made for people working on computers."
3,Beware of the size of this item,"the headsets are known to be big, and non-adjustable. hence, if your head is not big enough, the earphones will come down with the bottom ear cup pressing against your head more than the top, which makes this whole headset uncomfortable. i bent the metal wires on the top to adjust the width of the headset, which helped a lot. however doing that would destroy the looks of it. the reason i got it was for comfort, and was pretty disappointed."
1,pumpkin head? basketball head?,"I tried these on for about 30 seconds before deciding to return them. There is no adjustment possible, and if your head is any smaller than a basketball (an epic gourd, or a watermelon, maybe) you should reconsider this purchase. They sound fine, and the cord is nice and long, with great flexibility. But other than that, they are laughably unusable."
5,THE one book to read on the Middle East,"""How wide is Israel? Forty miles. How wide is Irael without the West Bank? Ten miles wide"". This is what Netanyahu gives you in this book. FACTS!Netanyahu does a brilliant job of stating his case (for Israel...obviously) and then...backing it up with FACTS!! He has done his research on UN, U. S., British and Palestinian documents and has INCLUDED them as appendices in the book. Hence, you are not reading opinion...but finally...facts about this tiny nation surrounded by a sea of enemies. One point here is that the PLO was formed in 1964, THREE years before Israel took the West Bank. This is just one of the many nuggets to be found in this book.If you're going to read ONE book on the Middle East...read this one. It's full of good facts about the Middle East thoroughly researched by Netanyahu whose writing style is convincing and EASY to READ!!"
5,After 3 HPs in 6 years.... I buy Brothers.,"For cost/benefit, I've been impressed with all the Brothers I've bought, both those for home (5050 B&W Laser and the multifunction 420CN). I also own 2 additional 5050s at my office and have had no problem with them. Suffice it to say that I've had precisely the opposite experience with HPs, with major, irreparable breakdowns in within 6 months of warranty expiration on each one. Plus, Brother has a neat philosophy of common sense cartridge replacement - if your color HP cartridge runs out, you have to replace the whole thing for $50 or so right then. Brother, on the other hand, allows you to replace individual color cartridges (black, cyan, yellow, red) as they run out, for $10 to $15 apiece. Lots of savings. My Brother B&W lasers were cheaper than equivalent quality competing brands, so I wasn't expecting much, but they've been basically flawless for 2+ years now and exceeded the rating on the toner cartridge by hundreds of pages."
5,Uniquely Texan. Lansdale's best.,"Joe R. Lansdale is a writer of unique qualities. His stories are set in Texas, his native home, and his style evokes a wonderful sense of place flavoring each of his short stories and novels. The people and events he writes about are always singular, standing out in one's imagination long after the pages are closed and the story over.With ""The Bottoms,"" Lansdale has written a haunting story, a complex mystery clothed in Lansdale's Depression-era Texas, a beautiful coming-of-age story. It is a book of lasting importance, the best so far for Joe R. Lansdale.So as not to give away the plot, I will just say if you enjoyed ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Huckleberry Finn,"" or ""Stand By Me,"" you will enjoy ""The Bottoms.""It's a worth addition to anyone's library."
3,A split decision.,"The story drew me in, and Lansdale very skillfully develops characters in as few words as any writer I know. Dialog is entertaining and telling, and sounds very Southern. Only one problem - you'll have no difficulty identifying the murderer once you're in about one third of the book. So the climactic ending is quite anticlimatic, and consequently is a good bit of a letdown."
4,Good Book! But thank Harper Lee too...,"This was the first I have read of Joe Lansdale's books and I'd now like to read others. The plot moves very quickly (I read it in 2 nights), the characters are believable, the setting is vividly described, the dialogue some of the more realistic I have seen in books about the South. Lansdale does not gloss over any of the more disturbing aspects of race relations.At times I thought 'The Bottoms' borrowed a little too heavily from 'To Kill A Mockingbird.' If you want to see Atticus Finch fall off the wagon and lose his temper or Boo Radley in his creepiest role yet, you should check this one out.Highly recommended...I'll definitely read more by this writer."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book on the basis of its award and the rave reviews I read about it here. The plot is used largely as a vehicle for making points and describing characters, who are mainly stereotypes associated with the points being made. There's little real suspense. The ending is not surprising because of the too obvious clues that precede it. The real surprises are the strange ways people behave throughout the book. I didn't think they acted in ways I could accept as believable. I tried to understand what others liked about this novel but ultimately couldn't."
3,To Kill a Mockingbird,"Joe Lansdale, I know ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""The Bottoms is NO "" Mockingbird."" I will grant you that it is a good read--but it is not a great read. I knew who ""The Goatman"" was fairly early in the game, although the identity of the ""real killer"" was not clear to me until the end. The book has its moments--most notably the run and chase ending--but it also has too much of the feel of pulp fiction trying to be something more. The fathrer's quick recovery from drinking and the early insight of a black physician into the work of Kraft-Ebbing is a little too much to believe. But it does have its moments and it is not to be ignored."
4,A Good Overlook on Modern Martial Arts,"Kieth Yates has written a fine book on the martial arts and the various systems involved. This is the book a beginner should get as he or she can shift through the many differnt styles and systems to determine what might be right for them.He does a good job in presenting the history accuaretly, yet concisely. A must for people jsut being introduced to the subject. A quickly touches the ""physical and mental"" aspects of the arts and then divides the chapters into Modern Karate, Judo, Kung Fu, etc. The last part of the book deals with training.The profiles of certian martial artist is also nice. Less known, but highly regarded martail artist are written about in this section.The drawbacks are the books price (... is steep for a small book) and traditional karate is not represented. Even though I had points of disagreement i certain sections, it does not negate the overall excellence of this work."
1,Never Again!,"I will NEVER purchase an Intuit product again. I use computer products to make my life easier, not more difficult. I have used TurboTax every year it has been produced except one. (I used TaxCut one year but switched back to TurboTax when Kiplinger screwed me out of the rebate.). I do my taxes on one computer and print the forms on another because my printer does not function properly. TurboTax will not let you do this. Once you activate the software, it is locked to that computer for printing and electronic filing. I'm sorry, I don't have the time to fight with Intuit. Note, that you must be able to connect the computer on which the software is installed to Intuit. You cannot install it on one computer and connect to Intuit via another computer or telephone line. In addition, if the computer that contains the modem in networked, you may not get the software properly activated. Never, never, never again! I'd rather switch than fight!"
1,NEVER EVER BUY THIS!!!!,"Do not buy this product. This product contains a program to send information and God knows what back to Intuit and who knows who else. The C_dilla/Safecast program installs on your computer and can, among other things disable your CD burner. There is an uninstaller for this but then your TurboTax will not work or will not print your return. The installer does NOT completely remove all traces of this program so it stays on your computer even if you uninstall TurboTax and the C_dilla/Safecast software. Also, if TurboTax is not allowed to contact Intuit via the internt (without your knowledge) it disables itself and requires you to get a new activation code to open the software. I have been a loyal user since 1995 but will NEVER EVER BUY a piece of software from Intuit again."
1,Spywhere everywhere on my pristine machine :(,"In the past I've used and enjoyed Inuit's products - good user interface, useful features, but lately I've grown wary of their marketing masquerades. After installing TurboTax2002 I am finally fed up. I hate spyware. Good bye Intuit. I'll be using Microsoft Money (instead of Quicken) and the associated online tax preparation software next year."
1,No Ability to Store,I have been using this product for 7-8 years and have always kept my old copies to help with subsequent years. To do that you need to be able to run the software on multiple machines. I certainly have changed computers several times over that period. The new product can only be housed on one computer and cannot be copied to other machines. I simply can not use it under those circumstances and will have to use H&R software this year.
2,Turbo Tax,"I don't understand how you can resell this. This year it seems that you can only get full use of this software on only one computer. Full use meaning, once you load it onto one computer you can get full use, but if you load it on any other computer you can use it, but you cannot print the finished product. In order to print you would have to purchase and additional license.Am I missing something?"
5,excellent program,"I have used turbo tax products for over 5 years. I found it very easy to use - no problems whatsoever. Everything was clear. They provide you with all the tax info you need to prepare your return. I'm not too happy by the security they imposed this year, yet it is a good program and you can uninstall the security device after you are done with your taxes."
1,Crash City,"I used Turbo Tax Business and Turbo Tax Basic this year. The business version repeated crashed my computer and I had to re-install and start my return over twice. The Basic version repeatedly performed ""illegal procedures"". I re-installed once and had to completely redo my return. I finally got my tax returns completed but not without an extraordinary amount of effort. I would have been better served with a pencil and paper forms.In addition the software does not ask the appropriate questions for 2% shareholders of an S-Corp that have fringe benefits included on their W-2's. If you don't know the tax law you will overpay taxes."
1,Goodbuy Intuit,No Turbotax for me anymore. This intrusion by Intuit makes me also worry about the next version of Quicken! I think I'll pass that one too; just in case...
1,Unacceptable,"The inclusion of an unremovable spyware program (c-dilla) is insulting, and enough to ensure I never buy another Intuit program."
1,Couldn't Even Install it,"My Cd sleeve didn't contain the product key necessary to install the software. Intuit's answer was to mail it back to them and they'd replace. That does me no good because I have time to work on taxes now, not in 2 weeks. Add that to the spyware controversy--I'm going to buy TaxCut. Turbo Tax has lost me, a many year customer, probably forever."
1,Do not buy this program!!!,I installed the program and suddenly my computer started crashing. The program appears to install some spyware that was probably the source of the conflicts. I uninstalled the program but my computer continued to have problems. It's been a horror. I will probably have to reformat the hard drive and reinstall the operating system because of the program. I should never have agreed to the terms. I just wish I could have returned the program but it was too late because I had opened the box. It's not worth it. In the future I will use TaxCut by H&R Block.
1,Overpriced junk made even worse this year!,"This software, which is already overpriced junk ... historically, now leads the pack for the 2003 award for Most Obnoxious Software with the addition of ""mother-may-I"" copy protection (can't use it without Intuit's express permission on a single machine) and installation of admitted spyware (""C-Dilla"" aka, ""SafeCast"") that stays even when TurboTax is uninstalled! ..."
1,horrible,I could not install this software on my computer though I have used it for over 5 years previously without problems. I spent hours online getting bad advice and finally a free telephone conference(I had to pay for the phone line) with an expert. You cannot use this software if you use a firewall. The TurboTAx experts will stonewall you on this--they know there is a problem but will not come clean.Do not purchase this software.
3,Mediocre at best...,"Forbidden was one of a kazillion thrash metal bands making the rounds in the 80's and early 90's. This is considered by many Thrash metal fans as Forbidden at its finest, well if this is so, then Forbidden was never such a great band. I mean, there were 100 other groups playing the same music, with better riffs, cooler lyrics and just an all around better sound. Proof of this is how they never really became as sucessful as ""MONSTER"" thrash bands like Slayer, Sodom, Anthrax, and even Metallica...All in all, this is just like another kazillion thrash metal albums, dont waste your money on this band, if you want quality thrash, check out bands like Dark Angel, Kreator, or Testament. (The review below is also mine, I had done it anonymous first)"
3,Classic 80's Metal,"Forbidden Evil, from the classic 80's Metal band Forbidden, exemplifies the sound and intensity of metal's early heyday peak. Vocals in the style of Power Metal (ala Iron Maiden or Dio) combine with driving riffs and rhythms that approach modern day ""jackhammer"" speed and fierceness. There are no death growls here, nor complex musical thoughts. It is straightup party Metal that was so typical of the day.This album has some throw away, trite tracks on it. However, it gains momentum and finishes fully: leaving a sense of satisfaction.For fans of 80's Metal but not for those who are connoisseurs of Metal born in the Twenty-First Century."
3,"NOT COMPLETE, LOTS OF INFO THOUGH","Has a lot of information, but very few really detailed or inside information about jobs."
3,It is what it is,"If You happen to be a Gavid Gilmour or Pink Floyd "" Nut "" like Me then this is a must for You colection. If not, DON't waste Your Cash. There is only 3 song's on it and 2 of them are Arnold Layne. That's about all I can say about this one....."
1,"Horrid, Simply Horrid","David Gilmour has made a living off of singing songs written by Roger Waters and pretending that he had a hand in the song. Now, to leverage off of the death of Roger's former bandmate, Syd Barrett, Gilmour actually has the nerve to sing and release a cover of Arnold Layne.When this song was written, recorded, and released by Pink Floyd, Gilmour wasnt even in the band. But that wont stop Gilmour from tring to make a buck or two off of someone else's talent...he has done it for 30 years off of Roger Water's talent.However, I suppose it beats singing songs written by his hilariously embarrassing untalented wife, Polly Samson, which he has done in his last two terrible efforts (Division Bell and On An Island).Some people simply have no shame."
3,It's just okay,"I read the reviews and thought this would be wonderful. And maybe you'll like it, but I wanted to note the downsides because I'm really not impressed:1) It's hard to get it rolling since garlic cloves aren't totally round. It gets easier after there's some sticky garlic residue inside the tube, but it can be frustrating and except for the miraculous clove that zips out the side peeled every now and then, it's not consistently easy.2) If you have arthritis or weak hands this is not for you. My hands got really sore having to roll this back and forth while pushing down.3) It makes a mess. Most of the peels from your cloves don't stay inside the tube. Instead a lot of them come out onto your countertop.I am going back to the drawing board to find something a bit more user friendly even if it does cost more."
3,Still Working With This,"I recently received this and tried it following the directions that came with it. I discovered that this garlic peeler is a bit of a challenge, especially if the garlic clove is larger than expected. I had some struggle getting the garlic clove in and then getting it out. Rinsing it out took longer than I expected in trying to get the ""paper"" out as it stayed stuck inside. From the look of things, I will have to continue practicing with it. One other thing to consider...if you have any chronic difficulty with your hands, i.e. tendinitis, arthritis, or any condition causing pain in your hands, using this product can be complicated."
2,"Waste of time, effort and money","If you never use more than a clove or two of garlic and really hate to get your hands dirty, this might be the gadget for you. It does work well until the interior gets messy. After 2-3 cloves get peeled, the juices cause the skins to stick to the interior walls, each other and the garlic, creating a bigger mess and preventing the peeler from working properly until it is cleaned out.I've peeled plenty of cloves of garlic before this gadget came along, and I can do it faster and with less clean-up using nothing but my hands. I don't use it anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
4,"Good product, good value","Works as good as any other garlic peeler (i've had 3, all lost eventually). This one comes with a storage case, which will not only keep it in better shape longer, but also help keep track of it better."
1,Illustrations very poor,The illustrations for this book are all out of focus or very fuzzy. They look like copies of copies. I would suggest looking for another book if looking for good photos of painting by Jean Francois Millet.
1,Worst book ever,"This book is completely biased and the research published inside of it as false. This is because the author studied only girls in private schools who were mostly white and from very affluent backgrounds. From there he extrapolated that girls everywhere are doing perfectly and all getting 4.0's. Obviously from the standpoint of being a girl myself, I know that this is false. Don't waste your time with this book!"
1,psychic pop-culture,"I study the forces of pop-culture from John Gray to Van Praagh and find the same recipe in each of them..""I have the answer"" ""I know what society is looking for"" and they attempt to offer society what it wants to hear rather than what it should know about itself to clean up its act,grow up and live in reality."
1,Beautifully written,"This is a clearly written work on grief and loss coupled with a message of hope that JVP is uniquely qualified to deliver. Once again, he delivers the good news to those that need it."
3,ink smears,Does anyone have a suggestion for what type of pen to use to avoid smeared ink? I tried a regular ballpoint and a felt tip. Can't read what I wrote!
4,dig those drums,"bah! da da da da dish bah...art blakey made the tune a night in tunisia his own, his solo opening the selection is so spectacular i wanted the drumming to go on. but then i would had missed the straight out tenor playing of wayne shorter, followed by lee morgan.to call something a waltz outside of european based concert music is risky, the ear wants to make comparisons to hear if what is called a waltz is really a waltz or just someone saying something is a waltz. fortunately, for jazz there's fats waller's jitterbug waltz as the first jazz waltz. lee morgan's koko's waltz is in the tradition of the jazz waltz.blakey's a night in tunisia is a filler in your jazz collection. you can't claim to like jazz or talk about jazz unless you've at least heard tunisia. and for the ridiculously low price it's being offered, less than eight dollars, at this writing, you really shouldn't pass it up."
4,Horseshoe Bowl is great for holding your bets during game night,When we first received the bowl we thought it was a bit small but once we determined that it could be used to hold bets as well as hold double duty as our trophy we were pleasantly surprised.
3,Selenas secret book,I got the book today and I'm bit confussed to why on the first 30 pages it is all about golf? Is this in anyone else book please? Thanks
1,Disappointed in Cambridge Spies,"Being a fan of many British series and shows, I thought I would enjoy Cambridge Spies. Alas, I find very little, well actually nothing, positive to say of this movie. I didn't even finish watching it which has only happened to me twice in my lifetime. The plot did not flow well, the movie focused more on the sexual exploits of the characters than their spying activities. The motivation and other world events that were going on at the time were not mentioned or aligned with the events of the spies. Disappointed in this movie, and I do not recommend it. Rielly Ace of Spies was so much better than this movie."
1,no spare lenses,"Well I am very disapointed I bought this classes,since I have been Adidas fan since I was kid,I wanted shades with name Adidas on it,but after 10 days glases broke up in the midle after no really so strong hit(my Oakleys would never break up like fhat),and you do not ofer spare lanses so I replace it,so 130 dolars I paid for nothing.I stil like this shades,look good,protection is fine,make me very hapy when I veare them,so if you had replacement lanses,please let me no I want it desperately, Sincerely yours"
5,YUMMMM,Has alot of awesome info in this book and yummy recipes. highly recommemended. I am definitly going to be whipping up a lot of these recipes.
4,DELICIOUS & SOFT SONGS FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOWS,"ONE OF THE BEST RELEASE OF CAMILO, YOU MUST KNOW OF MUSIC, VOICE AND LETTER TO HEAR THIS CD."
2,Dries out with time,"Vizenor cleverly describes the world of animalia while preserving Native American culture, but it's not enough. Several parts were amusing, others deeply philosophical. Towards the end, however, the abstract nature of the text kills the creative voice and makes it more post-modern than literature."
5,Classic Playstation game guide,"I recently re-bought this game and needed the guide to figure out what to do, very helpful and informative. Older games were much more difficult than I remember."
4,"Funny, dark, quirky character comedy.","Two sisters in a backwoods Austrailian town fight over the affectionsand sexual attentions of a radio host who has moved to town from the'big city' of Brisbane.Has it's slow and repetitive moments, but George Shevtsov iswonderfully low key and idiosyncratic as the DJ, and there are somereally delightfully weird moments and plot twists."
4,So enjoyed it!,"Dark comedy at its finest. Loved the slow build up, never quite got the fishy references -maybe reptilian would have fitted the DJ better, but whatever the case, the movie is fun and quirky. The pic on the front of the CD case does not fit the movie type. Think Napoleon Dynamite - that's the type this movie is. Loved that one too."
2,These pads have half as many post its as the usual pads,"The description is misleading. It says ""Four pads"" but these pads are really thin and have about half the number of post its as the usual size pads. Nowhere in the description does it state how many sheets are in each so I just assumed these were the standard size pads you get everywhere. These are really equivalent to 2 pads you buy in the store."
5,Post-it Notes Canary Yellow 3 x 3,I have found there will alway be a need for Post-it Notes! Love these! The only one I will buy!
5,Great precise fast pick,"This 3.0 pick is the the stiffest pick of the Stubby series by Dunlop. Doesn't flex in any bit. It's thicker than most picks - about 2x thicker then the Dunlop Jazz III (black and red) in the middle, then tapers off towards the edges. I like the thicker feel because you have something to ""grab"" onto.This pick is precise and fast. It also provides a good attack on the strings. This is a very small teardrop size that almost completely hides under the thumb. The bigger version of this is the Big Stubby which can be used for bass. If you don't like the feel and thickness of this but prefer a precise rigid unbendable pick try the Dunlop Jazz III (red or black) or its bigger version, the Dunlop Jazz III XL."
3,Too big,"I actually bought this item by mistake, I was looking for the stubby picks, not the big stubby ones. When you have tried the small stubby picks you realize that the size is perfect, they never slip from your fingers and don't have that hole in the center of the pick which doesn't properly fit in my fingers like the little stubby. It certainly works but I prefer another kind of pick."
3,"Nice heavy picks. Not really for me, though.","These picks are a little difficult to use because they are so thick; this means that the point is not a point on a flat surface but a slanted one. If you don't pick at exactly the right point the pick will sort of slide off and not produce the right tone.Granted that because it is so heavy, it will sound more like finger picking anyway. Ultimately I stopped using these picks because I prefer bigger bass picks because they are easier to hold."
4,Basically a Sabbath Greatest Hits album,"There should be a whole album and not just three songs. On the other hand, this is better than nothing. The three new songs are not masterpieces but are much better and heavier than the new material with Ozzy's Sabbath. Ear in the Wall is the best of the new songs, followed by The Devil Cried. Get this disc and the Hammersmith one.I hope there will be a live DVD from the Radio City concert.By the way, is there going to be a Black Sabbath Tony Martin Years album? He should get credit for being in Sabbath 10 years."
5,DIO/SABBATH JUST KILLS,"This album is the one that all the fans have wanted for a long time. Although this could have easily been a double or triple set, it at least has REMASTERS of the best old songs. Then to see this current tour and see them all performed LIVE is a wish come true. Well worth getting especially with the 3 new songs included."
4,Very Nice,"Functional and Fancy, and all around good buy. For a three bowl set the graduated sizes are just right for most of your baking needs."
3,Does Not Fit Older Model Saws,"The case was large and appeared to be durable; but my older model Milwaukee circular saw (7-1/4inch, 13 Amps) was too tall for the case; so I was not able to close the case. I determined from a review of the Milwaukee Power Tools website that the handles of their newer model circular saws (7-1/4 inch, 15 Amps) fold down to fit into this case. My older model saw handle does not fold down. So, I had to return the case.I bought the plastic case rather than the steel case due to the lower cost, but I think that I will need to buy the steel case now. I believe that the steel case was available when I bought my saw so it is likely that my saw would fit in it."
2,Thin plastic case.,"I guess that you have to expect it since they were bought out by a Chinese group, but the quality on Milwaukee items just keeps getting worse and worse with every passing few months.I had my last USA made metal Milwaukee saw case stolen, and after much research, determined that this case would fit my saw. It does fit my saw, but the metal latches on this plastic molded case are less than a third of the quality of the old latches on my stolen metal case, and the molded plastic used in the case itself is only about 1/2 as thick, or less, as two Dewalt plastic saw cases that I own.This case will keep my saw protected from most dirt and dust, but not water nor a weight of any kind. I have Langers cranberry juice jugs that are about the same thickness as this new case from Milwaukee. The two stars are only because it is better than a cardboard box, and it holds the circular saw and two extra blades fairly secure."
5,Good,Very good starting lens i got this lens for my first DSLR the nikon D60 I reccomend you buy this lens.
5,Fantastic clips,These clips are great. The have a nice strong magnet that grips tightly to the refrigerator. You can hang several sheets of paper with just one magnet and it won't slide down. They are also handy for hanging up notes or papers on metal bookcases at work. I plan to purchase additional sets.
2,I expected much more!,"After reading ""The White Rhino Hotel"", I was looking forward to this book. I truly enjoyed the cast of characters I knew would be inhabiting it from Bull's other novel set in Africa. I was disappointed. The people of the story are still well-written and the texture of the settings is first-rate. But the story left me cold. I know that ""coincidences"" and ""contrivances"" are necessary to any plot, this one was almost nothing but. If you like a rather brutish tale set during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and don't mind one set-up after another, you'll really like this adventure book. You will care about the characters. However, if you can get a copy of ""The White Rhino Hotel"", I'd think you'd spend your reading time with a much better story."
2,Not as pictured,"The rack is not as pictured. I bought it because my bike did not have the brackets to screw a rack to the frame. Although the picture shows clamps for attaching both the top and the bottom of the rack to the bike frame, the rack only has clamps for the top of the rack. I had to fashion my own clamps out of insulated p-clamps (in the electrical department at the hardware store). Also the rack is screwed together rather than welded which makes it less sturdy than most racks. Get a welded rack at Performance bikes for about the same price ($15 when they are on sale)."
3,Decent rack. Gets the job done.,"This rack is fine for anyone going on short commutes. The design is sound. I would not fit pannier bags to it given that it seems to not support much weight. It will easily handle a basket with some groceries or books, but that is it. Fitting to the rear of the seat post area may create an angle problem for some bikes. Most should not have a problem. You can get better quality, but it will cost you."
2,missing parts,"The rack works fine, but the instructions are illegible and insufficient. If you buy this, be ready to get additional parts and figure it out onyour own."
3,Bell CarGo Rear Bicycle Rack,"The rack is OK. The instructions are nonexistant so you must have a little knowledge to complete the installation. I needed two more bolts, lock washers and nuts to get it on my bike. After it is on it is strong and does what Bell says it will and looks good to."
3,Not built for all bikes.,"Nice rack, except for the fact that the front brackets that keep the rack from flopping back and forth are not long enough to attach to my bike. Fortunately my husband is handy in metal working and is building new brackets."
2,Poor exterior finish,"Even though I am very careful with how I use and store my pots and pans the exterior of this set scratches very easity due to normal use. I store my set in a deep drawer in my new kitchen and removing and replacing these causes the scratches. I am very disappointed in the poor exterior finish and how badly this set looks. I would not buy this set again. I sent a pot back to Meyer for their inspection and am waiting to hear from them. I will probably replace this set very soon, but not with another Anolon product."
5,good and basic,"Very nicely made. The pots heat evenly and quickly. Although the lid handles get quite hot, so I actually give 4.5 stars."
2,WAY too technical for anyone but bodybuilders!,"While this book handles some issues that Atkins doesn't address - such as AMOUNTS of food and calories ultimately mattering - it's too demanding of the non-bodybuilding dieter, who may not be measuring each gram of fat, protein and carb with such detail. The tone of this book assumes the dieter has complete self-control and no emotional issues when it comes to food - and can make shifts in carb/fat/protein balance in his or her diet with no difficulties or resistance! This may be helpful to athletes who want to develop a certain physique - in my opinion, it's pretty useless information to those of us who are just trying to eat healthier and lose some weight! Better to stick with Atkins - a lot better written, and much less expensive!"
5,I Love Estee Lauder!,"Estee Lauder has the greatest smelling perfume ever. My husband actually found this deal. I've been wanting Pleasures for quite a while now. We got a 3.4 oz bottle for $54.99 and no shipping cost. That is how much you would pay for a 1.7 oz with a small bottle of lotion at a department store. We jumped on this deal. It got here in a quick manner; smelled great, no box damage, and the bottle was full. It smelled so great, my husband wouldn't leave me alone. The light floral fragrance stays with you all day and you don't have to constantly reapply. I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Estee Lauder's perfumes and the company that I purchased it from and sold it to me at such a great price."
2,NOT THE 189min. VERSION-ONLY 161mins.,This movie of Hawaii on DVD is listed as 189mins. This is NOT TRUE!! This movie of HAWII is only 161mins.--This is NOT the FULL Movie!!! This must be corrected by Amazon!! No one is going to pay the outragous price you are asking for one- movie. Hopefuly soon they will release the full 189mins on Blu-ray and stop all this ridiculous priceing!!!
2,It is NOT the roadshow version--it is the edited version,"Once again MGM/UA proves they have no respect for their potential audience. Despite what is written below, the DVD release of ""Hawaii"" is NOT the uncut roadshow version, but the edited version. There is no excuse for this atrocity--both the laserdisc and the most recent VHS release were the uncut versions, and there is no noticeable quality difference in the elements, so MGM/UA just doesn't care. I recommend boycotting this release until someone at MGM/UA gets the message. Not that I'm holding my breath."
1,A waste of a great story,"This movie sucks. It's miscast, skin-crawlingly overacted, and just damned boring. I fell asleep 2 or 3 times trying to get through it. The only reason I didn't give up was because of how much I enjoyed the Michener book. Max Von Sydow was a disaster as Reverend Abner Hale, as was Richard Harris in the role of Captain Hoxworth. They're both great actors and I've liked them very much in other roles. But these guys ruined ""Hawaii"".A waste of a great story. A waste of time and money. Don't buy this."
3,good,charaters were somewhat strange about their choices and relationships. but i guess that's what makes it dating.
2,Catherine Keener is funny but the movie is bland.,"Walking and Talking is not as funny or engaging as Friends with Money and Lovely and Amazing. Those two movies had depth and soul.Walking and Talking involves a small group of friends and their silly but mundane problems. This movie is like watching a very long episode of the TV show ""Friends"". Catherine Keener plays a character very similar to Phoebe. The other friends are superficial, uninteresting, and immature. Anne Heche is especially annoying as the incompetent therapist. Grade: D+"
1,Avoid this one,"Sloppy playing, bad sounds and the solos are all alike - nothing compared to his work on albums. Get LIve!! instead"
4,Good deal - just as advertised,Bought this used book to replace lost library book. Worked out fine. Shipping could have been a little faster though.
3,mini version of kosmic consciousness,"I found some new tidbits in this format that were very helpful, but in general, I had heard most of this on Kosmic Consciousness.IOS is probably best suited for those who don't want to sit through 12 hours of interview. If you like a lot of material, Kosmic Consciousness might be better. It's probably a matter of personal preference.I'm really looking forward to the Integral Life Practice Starter Kit to be published in Dec 2005. I think that the more extensive format is my preferred way to access to Ken Wilber and I imagine that the depth of coverage I'm looking for to follow up Kosmic Consciousness is going to be on ILPSK.Good stuff on here, but if you have KC you probably don't need this. This could be a good intro to KW for those never exposed. Start w/ the DVD's and skip around until you find a topic you're interested in. Do the DVD's first and then follow up w/ the written material. That's my suggestion at least."
3,Its a cookbook,It is a book i got what I ordered. I have not read it completely yet so I can't recommend it as of yet. but so far its good.
1,Not Scholary Attempt,"This needs to be updated. Michael Sprinker is deceased and there is no mention of that. Also a bibliography would be nice, as the man was a scholar and wrote so much."
1,I really wanted to say something nice...,"Ok, I have had TWO sets of these outdoor lights sent to me. one, as the original purchase, the second as a replacement. BOTH arrived with the glass shades shattered. I will no longer purchase anything fragile made by this company. Amazon did attempt to pack the manufacturers boxes well, but Angelo Bros. products are loose in their own packaging. I have sent both back and will look for alternatives in my local area.Amazon makes it easy to return items and I have no trouble with Amazon...."
2,Lame,"Even if you are a crazy big fan of Felicia Day, don't expect to like this movie. While the premise is interesting, the CGI reasonable, and Felicia is pretty, everything else really stinks... writing, acting, and directing. Skip this one."
3,Not Really A Bad Werewolf Movie,"A descendant of Little Red Riding Hood, Virginia 'Red' Sullivan, played by Felicia Day brings her fiancé home to meet her family and to also reveal their occupation as werewolfhunters, but after he is bitten by a werewolf, she must then protect him from her own family. Pretty much end of story. I am not so much a purist when it comes to movies,but more of a person who buys and watches movies for the story or who is in that particular movie. In this case, I really got it because Felicia Day was the star and I happento like her. The movie had some good moments and I like Stephen McHattie (Gabriel) as well. After all it is an 88 minute TV movie. I enjoyed it and am happy to haveit in my collection."
2,Don't buy this book,I think this book would have been useful several years ago but this edition is almost 10 years old and the information contained is out of date. The elevation profiles provided for the roads in Alaska are also misleading and not detailed enough to be reliable.I wouldn't recommend that you buy this book if you intend to tour Alaska. Buy a general guide book (Lonely Planet or Rough Guide) and get some decent maps instead.
4,The quintessential ramen movie,"This movie is just like good ramen - a perfectly homely base with lots of goodies thrown in for good measure. This was the first Japanese movie I'd seen besides the whole Godzilla thing. It is so delightful at times and so confusing at other times that it provided me a good starting point for seeing other Japanese movies. The story is so familiar and yet handled so differently that you can't wait to see what comes next. I actually loved the gangster scenes just because they seemed so out of left field and yet so appropriate to the tone of the movie. If you love Japanese dramas like Kurosawa, this movie may not be for you, but if you liked 'Shall We Dance', you'll probably like this one too. But be prepared for strangeness!"
4,An utterly charming film....,"It has everything... a sort of love story with a subplot, a lot of truly amusing scenes and lines, interesting asides, a little sex, nice camera work and cleanly developed characters. OK, a few little things don't make sense, but so what? Doesn't stop the film's enjoyability (is that a word?) in any way, shape or form. WELL worth renting or even owning. BUt afterward, you really crave some of those noodles!!"
4,Good not great,"the pros of this lens are:1.it is light about 237g (8.4oz)2.it's rubber body makes it easy to focus or focal length.3.focusing is very smooth4.28-80 focal lengthThe cons of this lens are:1.switching between 50mm to 28mm seems to be stiff(this could be just mine)2.Minimum Aperture is only F/223.Minimum Focus Distance is 27.5 inoverall a good lens not great, great for the price great, brand (in my opinion) don't pay more than 60.00 yes i know it has a msrp of 133.95 but relay who pays msrp. hop my review helps you in your decision."
4,Auto Clipboard,This is a great accessory for anyone who takes business calls on their cell phone in their auto. The only suggestion I have is that it should include information regarding ordering refills for the pad of paper included.
3,"Started off beautifully, but after 1 month....","Bought this TV at BestBuy. We loved the features, picture quality and the overall design of the TV. Everything was great until about day #29 when the screen was all white when we turned it on. After several tries we got it to work. After 3 days of phone tag we fiunally get to talk to our sales person, manager of the department, and he tells us we are 2 days over the 30 days and he won't do anything for us. Long story short we point out that it was 30 days from the day it was delivered and they agreed to take care of it. After another week we finally get a repair man out and he says we need a new circuit board. So now 4 days later, we can barely get the tv on now and no word on when we are going to get the part. By the way it is discontinued. Buy another TV! I wish we would have bought the Panasonic and will if we end up having to replace this one. Also, it is BS that you have to buy a warranty, but I will buy one to just to protect my $5000 investment."
1,An extended Owner's Manual,"This book seems to be an expanded version of the owner's manual for the D70. It could be that my expectations for this book were unrealistic; however, I found little in this book that was not already covered in the owner's manual that comes with the camera. The book is relatively devoid of examples as well as photos. For someone who is a novice, there are very few step by step instructions. The explanations of the technical workings of the camera are good; however, for those who are looking for tips and insight into how to take photos in specific circumstances with the D70, this book seems to fall short. If you are someone who has lost their owner's manual and want a good (or better) replacement, this is the book to get."
3,Plenty of action and realistic character generation.,"Although the story is reminiscent of Moby Dick, it was entertaining. The CG of the dragons and flying sequences were done well and believable."
3,They Obviously Had Enough Time To Think Up A Name For It!!,"When this album first came out I thought it was great. Maybe it was. Some of it still is. When it's ""immediate"" successor (immediate at least in the group's 1980's sense of time) ""Invisible Touch"" came out I thought THAT was [garbage]. It's weird what almost two decades can do to your sense of music appreciation. There's a reason that almost every track on ""Touch"" became a radio hit (Hey - it's NOT a sin!) and virtually nothing on this disc is remembered. But then, if you want to know where my Genesis perspective is focused, gimme that band on ""Second's Out"". . ."
4,one of the best,"to start off the only reason I bought the cd was because of the song ""mama"".When I hear that song,I also hear ""in the air tonight"" by Phil Collins.I think it's a great album but I like these songs more when they're live because you can feel more energy through the muzik and words.Phil Collins reigns supreme"
2,Not a great product for many reasons,"This guitar pick, when held properly, is slippery, does not fit your fingers correctly, and is easily nicked by guitar strings. The worst part about this is the nicking, because once it is nicked your stings can get caught in it and break. Don't worry, this was not some freak accident, it happened with almost every pick that came in this package.I understand that the pick is designed to be easier to hold, but ""stubby"" is not that great. ""Textured"" would have been much better.I would say that one pro is how solid it ""feels"", but because the guitar pick is easily blemished by electric and acoustic strings, it would be inappropriate to call this product ""solid""."
2,"good for fast picking, but dull sound","Picks are a personal thing, and no one pick suits every situation. The big stubby is a very comfortable pick that will stay firmly in place in your hand. The fact that it's not flat but slightly rounded makes it great for fast picking. But it's sound is duller than a flat pick and less percussive, and for me that's a deal breaker. (I'm talking about acoustic picking. Maybe it's fine for electric.) And I don't like it at all for strumming, both because of the dullness and the lack of feel. So I bought a pack of these, which I almost never use and will give away to curious friends."
5,Big business,"This was a replacement movie the old one had become entangled, very badly snarled and unusable so I reordered it."
5,"My God, it's me with a bad haircut!","This is a true modern classic. A defining moment in ""the golden age of Touchstone."" A movie that can be watched over and over again and be just as hysterical each time."
3,"3 Stars, which should be 5. But disney is apparently cheap!","No extras on a DVD. Especially a film so loved with a countless cult following. I would like to ask that people not buy this and write or e-mail disney as to why that decision was made, I already have. Maybe some good will come of it. As for the movie, well I of course love it. Isn't that obvious?"
5,Razorback Scrub Cap,"This is a quality scrub cap. Looks really classy. It was shipped even faster than I expected, considering the Christmas rush. Thank you!"
3,Quick read,"Light, entertaining, and fun. The characters are fun to get to know. The plot is predictable, but entertaining to watch unfold."
4,My opinion of Clip-on/earbud Hybrid Headphones,"Sound great, a little tricky to get around my ears and in place. These headphones really need a carrying case of some kind."
5,A must! Foundational,This is a foundational text for those interested in the history of Latin America. Should be in every bibliography.
2,"Outdated, Dry, and Disorganized","This book provides an overview of Latin American History with an emphasis on economic and political trends. There is absolutely no reason for anyone today to read this book as its style and focus are completely outdated. The author also yields to the temptation with Latin American history to cluster all countries into a chronological account. The result here is disorganization and an unfocused text. Most texts written more recently realize the importance of clear organization and outlined topics as key components of an educational text. Unless you would like to intentionally make the learning process difficult for yourself, do yourself a favor and find an author who actually knows how to hold a students interest and convey history in a more informative and educational way."
1,Horrible,"This was one of the most unlikable films I've seen in a long, long time.The mood is set right at the beginning, when the main character just can't keep his hairy armpits from being spotlighted in the camera. It's gross, it's relentless, and apparently the director liked it that way.Then there's the overuse of the F word, again, setting the I'm-not-going-to-like-this-film mood. F this, F that. It's not even mildly realistic; it's gratuitous.The film goes from strange to stranger. Pointless. Ugly people. Ugly language. Ugly...I was going to say ""ugly story"" but there doesn't seem to be a story.I didn't pay a lot for this DVD, and it's now on its way to the city landfill, where it should feel at home.Garbage."
3,CloseÉ but not quite.,"Too many cooks tend to spoil the broth. A hackneyed phrase? Not as hackneyed as some of the moments in this glacially paced dramatic comedy. Anyone who has seen The Player, The Big Picture and The Big Chill can easily spot some of the overused cliches in this look at dysfunctional Hollywood relationships. At least we were spared the inclusion of Woody Allen in this surprisingly unfunny ensemble film.Aside from Jennifer Jason Leigh, Alan Cummings and Kevin Klein, wellÉ playing Kevin Klein, the audience is treated to a succession of bland and ultimately forgettable characters.For a film chock-full of great character actors, they are left high and dry by a lackluster script that hints at David Mamet but just doesn't captivate as Mamet's ""State and Main"" did last year."
2,Dvd Beaches,I'm sorry but I had a problem with the Dvd it stops in the middle of the movie I miss a big part of it.
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,This movie is one of the best ever. I didn't think I would like it but it turns out I love it. I have seen it over ten times and it never gets old.
4,"Super affordable, less stick than hoped for","They get the job done for sure, but they do not have much re-stick power, and lose their stick after a while compared to other brands. Might not be an issue for some people, but I have a sticky system on my desk, so when they don't stick well it's bothersome.4 stars because it's super affordable, and you normally get what you pay for."
2,Not what was described,"I was expecting 1200 original notes on 3 x 3.Instead, all are yellow and blank.How am i supposed to be inspired or learn my word of a day from blank pages."
1,Junk,The Datamax II was a big disappointment. The first one we ordered for our son's 8th birthday showed up with the display not working. We exchanged it for another and the display on the replacement went bad after 2 days. We won't be ordering another.
1,data max,Was not working when i bought it the battery was gone out so sent it backmy 10 year old didnot want it any way!!didnot see how it functioned might have been a good buy if it worked.
5,Great Lightweight Trainer,"I'm a 6-foot-1, 155lbs marathoner, and I've been using these shoes for 2 months. At first these shoes felt more like slippers, and weighed next to nothing. Great responsiveness. The only downer is that for a tall and (relatively) heavy runner, these shoes are not for 100% weekly training. I developed a pain in the ball of my foot, and it immediately went away after switching to a more cushioned stability shoe. I give the shoe 5 stars because as a lightweight trainer, it has surpassed all of my expectations. A dream to run in. Just make sure to alternate with more cushioned shoes or stability shoes for your long runs and recovery runs (where blazing speed is not a must), so that your fore foot is getting the support it needs, especially if you're a tall runner like me."
1,Failed after light use,"Bought this saw to tile a small entry way. The saw cut well enough, but the motor stopped working after about 20 cuts in twelve inch tiles. I tried it again the next day, and at first it did not work. After fiddling with the on/off switch it came back on. Worked for a few cuts, and then shut down again, and never worked again. There is no reset button, or any way to get inside the saw. It ultimately ended up in the trash."
4,Liked it better on the Monterey Peninsula,"The book was different than your standard mystery, but once I got into it I refused to put it down. It's very well written, well edited, and it's even got a nice cover. I've bought all Mr. Snyder's books so far, and I'll buy the next one, too.I'd rate it five stars, but I want to leave the author and editor a little breathing room. These characters grow on you, even Waldo.Pretentious? Nah! You have to think a little, but that never hurt anybody.Thanks for another collection of words worth every penny I spent to read them."
2,Overwritten & pretentious,"I liked his first book and thought I'd look him up and see what else he'd written, but this book needs serious help. Conversations that are too pretentious and not related to real people, parts that beg for a good editor to cut them down, and overall just a mediocre story. A writer with potential, but I'm disappointed to see the direction he's gone in without an apparent guiding editorial hand."
3,"Highly recommended by GM, but is in old notation","According to some Grand Masters, this is the definitive book on Alekhine's brilliant chess play. Unfortunately, it is in the old English notation, which is enough to deter me from studying it seriously so far. A translation into the modern algebraic notation will do readers a great favor."
5,Excellent Party Music,"The lyrics can be dumb or annoying, but who cares! When they're backed up with foot-stomping base and insanely catchy music, it doesn't matter that you're trying desperately to understand the words to something that you only catch the occasional obscenity from. ""Asleep at the Wheel"" has been demonstrated to be *the* song *guaranteed* to get everybody with two functioning legs onto the dance floor, ""Lift Your Head Up High"" gets everybody bouncing and grinning, and the pseudo-Homer Simpson cameo is usually good for some giggles. ""Fire Water Burn,"" the only single I've heard played on the radio, is unfortunately the lamest. Don't judge the album by the single--it's very fun stuff!"
1,HA!,"THIS REALLY WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. IF YOU HAVE TO READ THIS TO FIND OUT WETHER OR NOT TO BUY IT...THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO BLOW THE MONEY. BELIEVE ME, I DID!!!"
4,A practical reference to add to your library...,"I have a number of books on Feng Shui, and while I'll admit this is not the most comprehensive, it certainly is full of practical information which I refer to. The author goes into a lot of detail with regard to the various room shapes and house shapes which I found helpfull. There are lots of illustrations which show the flow of chi and its effects.But the most interesting thing about this book is, when I followed her instructions regarding the placement of furniture in my husband's home office, the effect was almost immediate, and profound! My husband was looking for a job at that time, and had been through several interviews, but nothing definate had happened. I had just gotten this book, and after reading it, completely re-arranged the office. Within an hour of doing so, my husband got not one, but two job offers over the phone! I don't believe in coincidences, and think this made a definite difference. My advice is, try it, you might like it."
2,Not a beginning...,"As a neophyte to Feng Shui, this book appealed to me because it contained many examples of how to apply Feng Shui to everyday situations. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly organized - extracting information that could be useful in my everyday life wasn't intuitive. Feng Shui is an ancient and complex art - and it seems the only message that I got out of this book is I need to pay a consultant to apply Feng Shui to my environment."
4,A lifesaver!,I'm always creating and inventing things and it's so nice to be able to find parts and accessories that allow you to do this. I needed a threaded spindle to put on my rose engine lathe and this worked perfectly.
5,Smell Good!,This product is not sold in our stores anymore. It is the best smelling oil and it is light. Just follow the directions. The price was great.
5,great body oil,"it is a water soluble subtly scented and it really helps to keep your skin smooth and moist, it is a must especially in the winter time"
3,I Like It,"Neutrogena Body Oil is an added extra....something good especially through this exceptionally brutal winter. However, for me, it doesn't work as well in the shower as I expected it to. I love Neutrogena products and decided to try this. It works just OK during the shower. I even do as instructed...use on damp skin w/o rubbing off. I must say though, I find it works much better when I use it in the bath. Maybe it's the fact that it has more time to penetrate into the skin.I have sensitive skin & therefore I'm really comfortable w/Neutrogena's light products. I may have to get something a little stronger for the shower but for my baths...it's good!"
5,wife,great skin softner especially in winter-avilable locally but much more expensive.I have no idea why any more words are required
3,I hate the fragrance,"I use body lotion at least once a day. In the winter my skin gets extremely dry. I usually buy extra thick lotion to compensatefor the dry weather. I saw this online and thought I would give it a try since the reviews seem to be pretty good.I dislike the smell the moment I open the bottle. I'm not allergic to any fragrance. In fact, most of my face and body moisturizers have fragrance in them. This oil has a very strong chemical fragrance.I use the oil after my shower and it seems to work well. It absorbs quickly and my skin feels smooth and no dryness. I like its functionality, just not the smell. Next time I'll try the fragrance-free one if it's available."
5,Great Product,"Can't live without this~ greatest moisturizer for my sensitive skin. Wish they had it in PUMP form and have the unscented closer to the same price as the sesame scented..Regardless, I have been using this for YEARS!"
4,Trojan Rarities Box Set,"Three discs. 44,48,52 min. each approximately. Sound is good. This particular box set was chosen by the fans of Trojan Records. As such there are a lot of surprises for both the long-time reggae lover and the uninitiated. It's hard to believe that this is the 50th box set from Trojan. Made up of songs from the late sixties to the late seventies,there is a broad spectrum of artists. Fifty tracks by fifty artists means many different musical styles. Songs like Suffer Me Not to Rose Garden to It's Your Thing to Ain't That Peculiar are just some of the things you'll hear. The arrangements range from typical small groups to highly arranged horn backing. Should this be your first purchase? Probably not. This is aimed a bit toward long-time Trojan/reggae listeners. That said,there is still a lot to recommend here. The overall feel of this set is one of generalities,not one area of reggae music that other box sets fulfill."
1,Shipping sucked! Does Amazon allow reviews of their service? Where!,"I love the equipment. Easy to use, portable, easy to store at home, I adjust the tension with my bike gears as a ride, quiet enough for me, recommend buying it from a different shipper then Amazon to protect your investment.I was totally ticked (pi**'d) off at the condition of the box when it arrived. The post office said it was Amazon's fault 'cause there was too much air space in the box when it was shipped meaning it was ripped, crushed, and destroyed. I refused to accept the shipment, so the postman said he'd take it outta the box for inspection to make sure it wasn't damaged. Sigh! Get it together ppl!"
4,Good but a bit noisy,"This is great for rainy days and all but it's quite loud. You have to turn up the TV or headphones really loud to drown out the noise. It isn't bad if you live in a house but if you live in an apartment, your neighbors might not appreciate the volume of your television if you watch while training. Aside from that, it's great"
5,Great product,I really like this product. I don't have a lot of room for large exercise equipment so this fits perfectly in my house. I will be changing the back tire to reduce some of the noise but I am able to ride my bike and watch TV without waking my young child sleeping in the next room.
2,Noisy and clunky Taiwanese junk,"Not a quality item. I do not recommend this trainer unless you are, as I was, just looking for a cheap stationary trainer to try out the idea of riding a bike inside. If you are sure you want to train indoors, go ahead and buy a decent one that produces less noise and vibration. You could also buy this Bell unit from a local store, try it out, then return it since that would be easier than shipping back to Amazon. If you buy this one, you will just be buying a decent one soon anyhow."
2,fragile some parts.,"I just opened the box,the trainer is broken,I send back to replacement,but the second one is broken to and I cancel my purshase...I don't know is a shipping problem or the trainer is fragile......."
4,As advertised,"There is a little bit of a noise issue, but that's more a factor of my tires than anything else. Other than that its exactly what I wanted/expected."
3,Wrecks Tires,I used this for a while and my tire delaminated it completely came apart at the seam on my road bike. I thought perhaps my tire was a bit warn out so i replaced the tire and now a couple months later i'm encountering the same problem. Seems the pressure on the small area the tire meets the metal drum is too much stress for it to take.
1,"Too noisy, too little resistance","I returned this item and was unfortunately charge a large s&h; fee to return it.Problems:1) Even on the highest gear with ha mountain bike, there was way too little resistance to get a workout. If I use street bike tires, it's as if I'm just moving my feet (practically no workout). I might as well just lift the bike in the air and put weights on my feet.2) With mountain bike tires, it's unbearably noisy. It's worse than putting an index card near the tire (like kids to to make a motorcycle noise). The noise is so unbearable, I can't peddle faster (not because of the resistance), peddling faster causes pain to the ears.For the cost of one of these trainers, you should really just pay a bit more for an exercise bike. Unless you're a hardcore biker that *needs* to train on the bike s/he will be racing in. Unfortunately exercise bikes tend to have a smaller radius than a normal bike, which is why I thought this would be a good idea--I was wrong."
4,So excited!,"This product was so easy to set up which I loved. Other reviewers commented that it was a noisy model, so I was expecting it to be very loud and possibly upset my neighbors. I wasn't bad at all, and i could hear the tv clearly over it.i"
5,Great Simple Product,I have been looking into bicycle trainers for awhile now. My grandma had knee and ankle surgery and I wanted to get her something to help with rehabilitating them and getting exercise and movement.The product was simple to setup and easy to use which was great. It did not make her feel intimidated and allowed her to just hop on and worry about doing what she needed to.
4,Loud but does trick.,My first trainer. Set up was easy. It is loud as others have noted but it does the trick for what I wanted - working on cadence and spinning in the dark winter to come.
5,"As always, just Ernest","Always funny, but stupid. So if you like Jim Varney, add this to your collection. Always good for a great laugh."
3,More Innocent Than Stupid (Which Is A Good Thing),"This was the first ""Ernest"" movie, I think, that I watched and I was surprised that it wasn't as stupid as I thought it was or the title convinced me it would be. Well, the last 20 minutes was, but a lot of movies get really dumb in the last half hour.Most of it was nice, lighthearted fun that - cliché aside - is fun for the ""whole family."" There is nary a bad one word in this movie and it's old-fashioned slapstick and about as innocent as it gets.In the last 30 years, how many comedies do you see without a tons of sex and profanity? Almost none......so give ""Ernest""his due."
4,its ernest...,one of my favorite ones... doesnt have to be on blu ray... but when someone sees it on your shelf... their amazement is nice :)
5,Great Movie,I'm just now watching this in 2007 but this is still a wonderful movie for the family especially during Christmas time. This is a wonderful movie to always keep in your library of movies.
4,Great holiday movie,Loved this holiday movie and was happy to add it to the collection. It was a creative story cleverly told and well...can't beat the stars!
1,waste of money,This DVD doesn't work in my US DVD player!!! I'm disappointed and was really looking forward to watching this movie.
4,Whitney,Love anything Whitney is in the movie was grat will add it to my Whitney collection.Have to let my grandchildren watch
5,Improved product,Purchased this set to supplement a set we had purchased a few years ago. The pattern is the same but there are subtle differences in design that will make the new set more durable: more metal in the narrow areas of the spoons. Very happy with this.
5,I love this set and it's held up very well.,"I bought this set of Oneida Colonial Boston flatware a year ago. I was hesitant to leave a review too soon because my biggest concern was the metal itself and complaints about it not being the higher grade. It is the only set my family and I use and these pieces have been run through the dishwasher nearly every day in that year and they look as good as the day I took them out of the box. Not a speck of rust.The pieces themselves feel solid and look beautiful. After reading reviews on here I contemplated getting the upgraded Paul Revere pattern but it's much more expensive. Now, I'm glad I chose this set. Absolutely wonderful for the price and what you are getting. Highly recommend as a great everyday set for the family."
1,Clapton at his worst!,"A very dissapointing lack lustre performance from Mr Clapton, who decided to dress like a beach bum, and plays equally badly. Ommissions like Jeff Beck, from the concert are not acceptable. Larry Carlton did a good job but one short song, is far too short. Buddy Guy and Hubert Sumlin showed what real blues players can do (take note Eric you have so much to learn). The inclusion of obscure unknown artists, inplace of major players is a waste of time and money.I suggest saving your money on this DVD, and getting something else. Eric and his new multicoloured strat guitar are sounding tired and boring. He is poor to average in his playing ability, and is now living on a former reputation, he can not replicate these days."
1,sad,"Very sad with minimal McLaughlin, no Jeff Beck for heavens sake. BBKing either. Need I say more."
5,I Was There!,"This is a really good representation of the shows. They don't tell you that the Robert Cray cut was the first song of his set and was the best modern blues song of the day. Eric Johnson doing ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is one of the biggest missing moments. There were so many moments I'm sure it was daunting to pick them, but when John Mayer wailed his solo with Eric,BB,& Buddy watching then laid his guitar at the feet of Buddy Guy bowed to him and walked off the stage, there was more electricity in the air than the lightning that forced an early end to the show. Wish that one made it.The reality though is after you stand them all side by side for two days, Eric was still the best we heard all weekend. To bad the encore of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and ZZ Top doing ""I'm Going Down"" never happened. We heard them rehearsing it Saturday night outside the bowl on the way home from the promenade concerts, and it was over the top."
5,Region 1 only,"Very nice DVD set - but Amazon is right: this is a region 1 DVD only, so only viewable in the US. Alternatively, if you are outside the US, you can have your DVD player ""operated"", and remove the region thingy..."
4,Crossroads Guitar,If you like Eric Clapton you will love this DvD I first saw it on Public television and knew I had to have it. And was not disappointed.
5,20 Stars...At Least!,Buy itBuy itBuy itBuy itBuy itSteal it if you can't afford to buy it!Pros: Every guitar player worth his salt is on the DVD.Cons: You needed to read a review before you buy it? Shame on you!
2,Wouldn't buy again !,"They sent the wrong type bags, after being used- they were to long, wouldn't refund my purchase price or replace, TERRIBLE PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH."
2,Man. These are fine for the price--but lame compared to another set I own bought elsewhere.,"They are cheap, light and not terribly able to handle even tunes like Magic Bus from The Who.I had higher hopes for this product.They are not what we best expected, they have little reverb, don't feel like the weight of the rosewood set we owned previously--and they don't have the timber/vibration that proper Rhythm Sticks seem to.... I'm saddened by having to write this review. I wish they were better."
5,Only OEM cartridges for me....,"And this is an OEM cartridge. I have had my share of bad experiences with refill kits, after market and 3rd party cartridges. No more. Only OEM for me. This one is and works perfectly."
5,Printer Ink,"Not much to say about an ink cartridge except it arrived promptly, the price was good, and it worked."
4,Ink cartridge,"The outside package cover of the cartridge was stained with ink. When I open the box I thought they could not be used. The first thing I printed was all stained, but the following printigs came out fine and it is working.Thanks.Frances"
1,Utterly Useless,"I have to agree with anybody who has a negative review about this book. The author clearly wanted only to portray his ""artwork"" and make money off it by writing this useless book. Even a novice photographer like myself could get nothing worth while out of it. I am extremely disappointed in my purchase and I wasted a lot of money considering I have not even a handful of new knowledge to show for it. If you want to ""learn"" and get your moneys worth than I suggest spending your dollar on any of the Amherst Media books."
2,not much real substance,"I was disappointed that the book, although having some interesting but not excellent pictures, does not really give more guidance than to say, ""go out at dusk and shoot some pictures."" I was hoping for more empirical starting points to assure a higher likelihood of success in night shooting. The details of light conditions, equipment and film used in specific scenes is often incomplete, making it difficult to really use the info."
2,Same Same....,"The book itself is really not too bad. The writing is good and he explains himself ok, but if you've allready read one guide book on photography and you're looking for more in dept information, you're not going to find it here. The book starts out with general info on different cameras and equiptment, then moves on to telling a bit about light and exposure and finnishing of with a lot of exampels, though the pictures are ok, it dosen't inform you about what kind of films, filters, exposure etc. that has been used for each picture. Bottom line; A general GUIDE book like the others."
5,The best cookware I've ever used,"Since I purchased my set I've sworn off all other cookware. These pots and pans are simply amazing. Non- stick, easy to clean and a delight to cook with. I can fry in just a teaspoon of oil since the grooves prevent meats from sticking. I don't even mind washing pots and pans anymore since cleanup is a breeze. I don't need any abrasive sponges or cleansers. A regular yellow sponge and some dtergent will get rid of the greasiest, messiest grime you could cook up. I have never been happier in my kitchen."
2,no kidding,"but of course.women's rape torture mutilation equals men's suffering.what a great excuse:""we cant help it"".it wasn't the millions of people persecuted for being nothing but themselves and forced to physical labor until they died that suffered,it was the nazi leaders who couldnt help feeling that little guilty tug of conscience when they ordered that screaming human beings be shoved into ovens.all im saying is that excuses on behalf of an oppressive group do nothing but condone their behaviour.i know some people dont see it that away but other people learn from these types of propagated conclusions.helpful history lesson."
4,A Must See Comedy,"It has been some time since I saw this flick, but it is a must see for anyone who has not seen it."
1,This book needs feng shui.,"Aphoristic, not grounded in any theory, and unhelpful for my purposes. I was looking for something more than a statement or two about a topic per page. Written to showcase the illustrations, not the content."
2,Bag did not fit.,"Bag looked like it was reasonably well made, but it was an inch too small and would not fit on the frame. I sent it back to the vendor and asked for a replacement or a refund, and have heard nothing. $35 down the drain."
5,"Honda 21"" 214-series Steel Deck replacement grass bag","This bag was made from a lighter material than the original bag thus, allowing you to see the bag fill height before the grass started to spill out. The bag was nicely priced and also a perfect fit."
3,Mildly Entertaining / Teaches Some Good Morals,"This is about a young girl and her tragic experiences with drugs. It teaches some helpful morals. The 'editor' claims that this a real life diary, but both internal and external evidence shows this is more likely a fabrication. I'm sure, though, that it wouldn't be too hard to find a real life situation that turned out just as tragic. Judged as a work of fiction, this book contains a rather weak ending (the conclusion depends too much on inference). It is also rather ""graphic"" for typical moralistic fiction."
2,This is not a true story,"This is a work of fiction by a woman hell-bent on keeping teenagers from having sex, doing drugs, and worshipping Satan. I read it when I was in middle school (10 years ago) because I was a precocious child fascinated by sleazy books about sex and drugs and this is pretty much the only reason anyone should read this book. It's badly written, incredibly unbelievable, and seriously misinformed but kind of entertaining. I am horrified that anyone believes this to be non-fiction and that it is marketed as such."
5,A Real Diary... A Real Journey,"This book was absolutely amazing. To think that such a young girl, who was around my own age, experienced such pain and such a long journey of life is almost unfathomable. This young woman experienced so much in such a short span and until the end struggles to over come it. Anyone can respect her strength for that. I saw her as a hypocrite but the times of effort and strength made me fall in love and identify with her. Also, the the parents devotion amazed me and I was taken by surprise with this book. Everyone should read this, just to enjoy a good struggle or to gain perspective on their problems whether they be acid, pot, heroin, sex or just something mundane as everyday life."
5,a wonderful book,This book is about a teenager name Alice. She and her family move to a different city. She started school off great and had good grades until she met the wrong crowd. She began using drugs.I think this book teaches you about life and drugs and why you should not use drugs.
5,Go Ask Alice-A Review,"This amazing story about a teenage girl on drugs is one that anyone and everyone who has ever thought about doing or is currently doing drugs must absolutely read. The diary form of the book makes it even more real and down to earth. Overall, I would give this book a 10 out of 10, and would reccommend it to everyone!"
4,About a girl who was trippedon acid without her knowing,"I girl, Alice attends a party where LSD is put in her coca-Cola. From then on she tries everthing from weed to heroine. she basically ruins her life, runa away from home, etc..."
5,Will change your viewpoints,"I loved this book when I read it. I am 13 and in 8th grade. I read this book on my own free will when a couple friends told me how good it was. After finishing it in less than three days, I felt changed forever. It really shows you what people going thorugh drugs are feeling, and how many try so hard to get off, but they just can't. Reading this book also lets you relate to ""Alice"" and all her situations because of all the heart put into this book. I love this book and would recommend it to anyone, especially tennagers."
5,Just great!,"This book was the bomb!! But ""Anonymous"" was not!! She was stupid in what she did, never kept her promises, and made bad choices. I thought it was kind of gross at the end, with the worms eating her, but that stuff happens. I still don't completely understand how she got the worms. All I know is, this is a good book and shows lots about what you shouldn't do so you aren't a fool like ""Anonymous"". If you like this book, read ""Jay's Journal""."
4,As compelling as it was thirty years ago,"This book first came out thirty years ago and twenty years ago was when I first read it. Though three decades have passed, the book is still as relevant and compelling as it was then. It's a book that you won't be able to put down and one you will never forget. I give it a very high recommendation!"
5,The Best ever,"I have just finished this book and I found it totally insperational. Once I picked it up I never put it down, even though I had nightmares with myself in Alice's position. This is a must read book! ENJOY!"
2,Go Ask Alice,"This book is about a 15 year old girl who gets involved with drugs and she leaves her house to use more drugs. Then she comes back home but she leaves again and well she kind of tries to quit but she can't beacause she is addicted.I rate this book a 4 star because I think it tells you a lot of bad things that happen to you when you get invloved with drugs.Another thing is that I really recommend this book because it is a really good book even though the end is sad. Well, if you want to know more about this book read it and you will find out!"
5,Really Great Book,"I gave this book five stars because it was an awesome book. If you have read it, you have to like it. This book is mainly for a mature audience because of the drug usage. I would recommend this for kids ages twelve and up because of its explicit content. When I heard my classmates talking about this book, it made me want to read it, so I grabbed a copy. I read the back and it sounded really good so I read it. This book gives kids good information on how drugs can ruin your life. READ IT!!!!"
2,She deserved it.,"Ok, so when I first heard about the book I thought it would be very interesting. So I bought the book and started reading it. I was quite caught up in it at first, then it all when downhill just like Alice. Yes she was tricked her first time, but she was ready and willing her second and third and fourth. I felt no sorrow for her at all, she knew what she was getting into when she resorted back to her old ways. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I literally threw the book down in disgust right when I finished it. But if you're looking to teach you're kid not to do drugs, this book is easy to read and it'll probably scare the kid."
1,wow,"This book is simply horrible. Do not waste your money. Not only does this book openly state that one can develop an addiction to lsd and marijuana, it was perhaps the biggest waste of time I have ever encountered. Unless you are a conservative joke who wants to brainwash young people, do not buy this book. This book does not even deserve the one star that I gave it."
1,"Depressing, Boring, Bad in General","This book was extremely boring and depressing. It made drugs seem like a good thing to do in the beginning, which is bad, and then completely depresses you at the end when it tells you she died. I did not enjoy this book at all. And why don't they have a 0-star rating. 1 star implies that you may have found it slightly interesting."
5,No other book could ever compare!,"Go Aks Alice is a powerful and heart touching story of a 15 year old struggling to survive. This is my favorite book ever and I have spent the past 4 years trying to find a book that would intrigue me in the same manor. Unfortunately, I've yet to find it and have read this book over and over again. I recomend this to any one who ever has to deal with the human race and the hardships of growing up."
2,Go ask Tom or Sam or Mike....anybody !!!,This is a phenomenal book for keeping one off of drugs if they have already decided not to use them. Reccommended for ages twelve to sixteen. Anyone older should try Burroughs or Welsh.
5,The women spoke,"The story Go Ask Alise is kind of a depressing story. It's about a girl who does drugs and always wishes she were dead. She went to a new school and had no friends she walked around all day with no one to talk to; I could just imagine how she felt. Alise was a main character in the book she was the girl they always talked about. And her friend was a main character too, but I forgot her name. This book is really interesting I would recommend it to all my friend and I know some people at this school who can relate to her life I'm not using any names, but this one girl here sliced her wrist because she did not like her life. I think most teenage boys and girl would really like this book. I know I did"
5,Extraordianary Book,I cant begin to tell you how many books i have bought of this story... i read it over and over and the one i have now is so beat up its not funny i have it held together with a rubberband so i dont lose any of its pages... thanks for the job well done... it helped me through a lot and i understand alot now how do deal with my life...
5,Truth in Her Eyes,"Alice is a confused, mixed up, ordinary teenager. All she ever wanted to do was to fit in, whether it took losing weight, growing her hair and going to drugged out parties, or turning her hair up and hanging out with the squares. She travels randomly to distant cities with her friend and drug of the moment searching for her future. From utopia to hell, Alice explores the dark world of drug users, until, after time and again, she gives up drugs is threatened by her very friends from her hippy days. Joel is her saving grace, making the end sad but sweet."
3,Go Ask Alice,"Go Ask Alice is a book that captivates the life of a teenage drug user. It is a book I recommend all parents to read! It will help you, as parents understand the different situations children go through. Situations children have been faced with for years now. This book is a great mind opener, it gives great insight in to the minds of drug users, at least in to the mind of one of the many who abuse drugs. Go Ask Alice is not only a book parents should read but teenagers should also read this book. It will touch in so many levels, it will also allow you to relate to some of the conflicts brought up by the author. I, as a teenager was very shocked by some of the things the author talked about. I was able to understand why kids are so droned to use drugs. It is a real life story that will seem fiction to you even though you are aware of it being real. Once you read this book you will never forget it, you will never forget her!"
4,Still Thinking About it,"I am now 24 years old and I read this book when I was 18 or 19. I still think about it and how in such a short time things change in someone's life. I was sincerely shocked at the ending, which I believe I have never fully recovered."
4,whoa!,"Go ask alice was a great book. The teenager was normal in the beginning and then she gets introduced to drugs...it makes you think what if she never ran into the girl at the store who invited her to that one party? We see the girls transformation throughout the book from being innocent, to full out drugged, and back to seemingly innocent. The epilouge leaves room for ample imagination to the reader...one thing that suprised me was that it was written in the 70's- and yet it still has the same impact on teens. And one more thing- Alice. the book was written by anonymous. not Alice. Nowhere does it say that her name is Alice. An explanation about her name (anonymous, Alice?) would be nice, Thanks."
2,Unrealistic,"I enjoyed reading this book, just as I enjoy reading a lot of other books but it was completely unrealistic. I mean, what kind of stoners would torment and pick on someone like that? It's absurd. Seriously, have you ever met a mean stoner??? Tell the truth. They're not bad people. I know this from first hand experience. All of the stoners I've met are really nice, sharing, loving, and caring. And that's kind of dumb that the author said it was based on a real diary when that was a lie! Oh yea, I'll just make up this story about a girl who does drugs then realizes drugs are bad - then all the kids will stop doing drugs, right? I think not. Liar."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"When I began this book, I thought that it was going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread because I'm fascinated by the world of drugs. There was A LOT of drug use which was exciting, and I know I shouldn't be saying this because this was actually a real person, but it was also kinda boring. Also, the epilogue KILLED this book! I would have given this book 4 stars had I not read the last few paragraphs..."
3,Mehn...,"Did not like this read as much as I had expected to. This was not my type of book, and was expecting something different."
5,This book helps understand what path not to go down.,"This book is an excellent source for teens and I'm just stating the book in my Advanced Language Arts class. I really enjoy this book so far. I am slowy leraning the tradgedy of drugs and what they can do to you. I hope that you guys can request for that, for people to write or FIND more books based on this. Thank you, Baby Girl, Texas"
5,let's listen what Alice has to say,"Alice represents a hole generation of young lost kids that are trying to find themselves in this world that just cannot listen to them, listen to all the truths they have to tell. In this book, try to see the world as Alice had seen, and you'll probally understand her"
5,Review,"when i first heard of this book it caught my eye and captured my attention. i quickly became engaged in the book and felt as though i was sitting their along side the characters, i did not want to put it down. being a teen, the diary being a true story opened my eyes to the world and its consequences. You can't ignore whats going on in the world, and the reality is the truth. i recommend this book to anyone willing to see the truth in a world full of pain, confusion, and abandonment"
1,An obvious fabrication,"Ok, so I read this as a young teen in the mid 70s. At the time, I remember thinking it was such a frightening and realistic account of a young teen's descent into drugs. Albiet, by the time I was a young teen myself and read this for the first time, the 60s tumultuous LSD phase wasn't nearly as prevalent. Nonetheless, I was riveted. I recently found this book in my old stash of books and thought I'd re-read it. At age 44, my take on it is completely different. It doesn't take one long into the book to realize this is most definitely not written by a teenaged girl. The language isn't realistic and the diary seems so fabricated...to the point where I couldn't believe I had actually fallen for it way back when. The book seems silly to me now."
5,Go Ask Alice,I loved this book. The emotion that the protagonist conveys throughout the book is clearly relatable from generation to generation. I recommend this book for every teenager out there.
4,harsh,It seems insane to me that this is a real life diary. the fact that this girl changed so fast is frightening.
1,Totally unrealistic,"I first read this book when I was 11 or 12. At that time, I would have rated it five stars. And it did have an effect on me. It made me feel that drugs were evil.But now, I've spent some time in the real world. And upon re-examining the book I find holes big enough to drive a truck through, blatant lies and propaganda, and a central message that I simply don't agree with.So drugs are bad. Fair enough. But I don't think anyone deserves to be lied to by a diary that is clearly not a diary and supposedly true events that never could have happened. Teach your children not to abuse drugs. But don't rely on this extremist falsification to do your job for you!"
5,Great book,"AS A CHILD IN 7TH GRADE , I READ THIS BOOK . I FOUND IT SO COMPELLING AND SAD . I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT , AND I STILL DO . DRUGS ARE NOT OK AND IN MOST CASES USING HEAVY DRUGS SUCH AS METH , HERION ETC WILL LEAD TO MOST THINGS THAT THIS GIRL WENT THROUGH IN HER LIFE . I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE WITH MY OWN EYES . THIS BOOK MADE ME NEVER WANT TO DRUGS , AND I RECOMMEND IT TO TEENS TO READ"
5,A Classic,"Everyone can relate to Alice's story. Even if you've never tried a drug in your life, you will be able to relate to her anguish and pain. You will find your self in the story some how. If you like this book I suggest you buy ""The Perks Of Being A Wallflower""."
5,Think about life for a min.....,(...) I just think it is an amazing book that everyone should read. It puts the message out there on how drugs are not a thing that some people can just drop and you have to get help! You learn just because someone has everything going for them does not mean that they are not depressed or need help.This story is a diary of a teenager named Alice. How she gets into drugs. I cant say anything else though..cuz you have to read the book!
3,good...but...,"Back when this book was first published, there was alot of debates on the content, and whether or not that youth society should read it or not. Parents automatically assumed that because of sexual references and language that this isn't a books for their children, whether or not they took the time to read it. What Alice went through I think is a lesson to all of us, and I think that now days this book helps us all cope with the natural problems about teen sex, drugs, violence. We should all thank Alice, whoever she was for this book. ~Olivia~"
4,Life with or without DRUGS!,"Go Ask Alice is a real diary of a teenage drug abuser. This book shows readers how becoming addicted to drugs can turn a person's whole life into a big mess. Alice is a young girl who becomes involved with the wrong group of people. Drugs take a huge toll on her future actions. When she feels like she has nothing left in the world that matters, her grandparents are the ones she can trust and turn to. Seeing Alice live through a life of drugs is a lesson to all teens what can really happen once you are trapped in the world of wrong decisions. This book is a fast and easy read, once you start it is hard to put down. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to all readers."
5,How can you not love it?,"I can't imagine how anyone could read this book and not love it. I think it could only be a man who wouldn't like this book. I still have my mom's copy of this book from when she was a teenager. It has been passed from one girl to another through two generations and when my daughter is old enough, she'll read it too. The book is wonderful insight on how a young woman of the time could feel inside. How drugs could take over a girl from the right side of the tracks and how the parents never even really noticed. This book used to be required reading in most high schools and I think it still should be."
5,emotional and gut wrenching true story,"Go Ask Alice, is a touching and revealing true story of a teenage girl's battle with drug addiction. This is a diary of a 15 year old girl struggling to fit it with her peers, and succumbing to the pressure. The diary spans the last two years of Alice's life and allows you to take the journey of life with her, right up to the heartbreaking and tragic end."
3,Umm...Yeah,"Wow...So I was forced to read this book for a mother daughter book club and besides the fact that I was scared out of my wits, I think that it was a pretty good book. It isn't anything that I would ever pick up on my own, but there are definitely people out there that would like it. If you enjoy books like Perfect, or Drowning Anna, I would recommend it. If you are the sort of person who would rather read about things that are happy, or can't read creapy things before going to sleep, then this is NOT the book for you!I would say that overall it an ok book, especially if you are in a group so you can discuss the contents. Also, don't read the epilogue!! It is completely depressing, I don't know why the author added it."
4,Teenage life in the 1960's,"This book was a good representation of teenage life in the 1960's. The story was told with the point of view of a teenager living in that time; therefore giving a first person powerful point of veiw. It was the type of book that brought you to the time, it makes you feel as if you are there and you can understand what is going on. I feel that it describes how a teenager deals with life in this time, including: love, friends, school and drugs. It is a fast pase, interesting book that allows your mind to explore the mind of Alice. It keeps you reading and gives you a taste of her life and her time. It is the closest you can get to actually living in that time and having those experiences. I would recomend any teenager to read this, it will give them the understanding of life in the sixties and the problems of a young person of that time."
3,Unfortunately...,"I loved this book when I first read it... and the second time.. and the third time.. etc. etc.What everyone should know is that this is not an ACTUAL teenage diary. It is a work of fiction, written by Beatrice Sparks.The girl in the book did not exist, but that should not hinder anyone from reading it."
5,Frightening view of the inside life of Alice,"I read this book a couple years ago, yet I still remember the graphic details in my mind of this book. I remember how well it portrayed the pathetic and drug-filled life of Alice. During the entire story I had to keep telling myself that this was all real and this was an actual true story.Although this book did leave me with many strange expressions on my face. I felt sadness, relief, and confusion. This is an excellent book for teens and adults."
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie to be very disappointing. I thought at one time that Phillip Seymore Hoffman could not make a bad movie or have a bad performance. This movie just did nothing for me and I found it boring as hell. Ethan Hawke has not grown as all as an actor and I think he is pretty poor. Marisa Tomei was naked in the movie, that is the best I can say for it and I find her to be a poor actress as well. How she ever won and Academy Award is beyond me but hey, they gave one to Cuba Gooding too so that says alot."
4,Almost,"Except for the final 30 seconds, it was a great movie. And it makes you feel good too, because most families are somewhat dysfunctional and this one lowers the bar so much that you might feel good about your own. The acting was great, and the plot mindtwisting, convoluted and what more could you ask. Watch it, but shut it off before the last 30 seconds."
2,Sorry I wasted my time,"This movie jumped around too much without a good transition. Dont get me wrong, I love movies that do flash backs, but this movie did not transition well. It was very depressing and the way it ended was BULL SH**!!! It was a waste of the $1 I spend to see it and a waste of my two hours I could have spent watching something better."
5,A Good Combination,"This CD is great. we have a good combination between Classic Gregorian Chant and Modern orchestration of modern musics.Simply, Great!"
1,Full of half-truths and distortions about American education,"Blumenfeld's books is full of half-truths and distrotions about American education. Readers are better off with Berliner & Biddle's The Manufactured Crisis if they want an accurate, research-supported view of American schools."
2,Reliability Problems,"Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to use substandard Chinese capacitors which last just slightly longer than the warranty period, and this creates wild flickering problems followed by complete monitor failure. There is a fix if you are mechanically inclined, and it is well documented online, but it involves sourcing seven higher quality electolytic capacitors (total cost about $6) and soldering them in place and being careful about the high voltages inside.It's too bad Samsung chose to cut this corner. They probably saved all of two dollars."
2,Nice monitor... if you never turn it off.,"I'm on my second Samsung SyncMaster 204B and experiencing the same problems as the first. Whenever you put your computer into sleep mode or switch off the monitor, a problem develops: When you switch it back on, the picture becomes gradually dimmer with a noticeable flicker over time. My first one eventually died altogether within warranty, and Samsung sent me a replacement. It's been maybe six months and the same thing is happening. I'm not going to bother with another replacement, or with Samsung monitors again for that matter."
4,Pretty interesting!,"I have not had a chance to fully read this (besides, it is intended as a birthday gift for someone else). But what I did peek at looks intriguing."
4,EP Into An Album,"A welcome sight, the original EP with added bonus tracks that some ended up as ""B"" sides on 12"" singles. You just can't beat ""Ring Of Fire"" & ""Can't Make Love"". So buy this one & if you like this album, you'll want to get their first album ""Dark Continent"" which is a expensive one right now but worth the money & ""Call Of The West"". As long as Stan Ridgeway was the lead vocalist, this band was great."
5,The Index Masters-Wall Of Voodoo,Stan Ridgway at his best!!! Puts a entire new sound to the classic Johnny Cash Ring of fire (Or old sound being the CD from Wall Of Voodoo is 27 years old)!
5,Romantic pop tunes with a rustic spanish flavour,"Have the Vinyl version of the "" XXX "" album and I`m happy to see it`s now available in this 3 CD disc set . I look forward to receive my order . I`ll listen to it on a summer night with a glass of wine in my garden .5 stars ..."
5,Captain Ron Rules !!!,My family and I love the caribbean...so Captain Ron was a big hit with us !!!We want it on DVD !!!!!Come on producers....lets get in geer !!!
5,Hey i have a question for all the captain ron fans!,This is the greatest movie ever and i am so mad they never made a soundtrack but i was wondering if anyone knew the name of the song that first plays during the opening credits?? Please anyone!!!!
2,"Don't bother - If you've seen one Kurt Russell, etc.","This was a disappointment. Amazing that it was compared favorably with Master and Commander. Hoped it would be to sailing what Caddy Shack is to golfing; didn't happen. Weak plot, pathetic script, ""me-centered"" teens expecting the world to revolve around them while struggling to become reprobate, improbable (impossible) plot shifts. The 2 stars are for sailing in beautiful waters. I almost purchased it, glad I only rented it and saved $4."
2,Funny Failure,"I bought this movie as a gift, and was disappointed at the (very inapporiate) sexual content. This movie wasn't funny enough for me to want to watch it again, nor was it not a family movie. I would not watch this movie again because the laughs weren't enough to make it worth my while."
5,Funny And Sunny,"I Agree With Everybody,This Is A Feel Good Movie!Great Comedy And Sunny Surroundings,What More Do You Want."
3,Comedy Romp or Unauthorized Documentary?,"Down in the Sausalito docks, there are charter boat captains who will swear that Captain Ron is based on this guy they knew in Lahaina or Key West or Newport or wherever. If you've scrubbed a junky boatdeck or heard a load of martime malarky from some ""seasoned"" salt, then you'll find something to love in Captain Ron. Caught it again from the middle last night on TV and noticed for the first time the great Spanish rock-n-roll version of ""Who Put the Bomp"" playing on the radio of the old Chevy Ron boosts in Cuba. So grab a blended rum drink and kick off the summer with a fine tale of men...and the sea."
5,Peak of the Nash-era albums,"This is final full LP by the Graham Nash lineup. Although it has its flaws, it is fair to call this album a masterpiece. The title track is probably Graham Nash's greatest; certainly nothing he did with the Americans ever bettered it. This is a big production psychedelic album, as can be seen with the likes of ""Charlie & Fred,"" the ersatz Eastern ""Maker"" and giant Joe Meek-esque balladry of ""Would You Believe?"" However, there is also great Hollies pop rock with ""Dear Eloise,"" ""Step Inside"" (which should have been a single)and ""Postcard."" Gripes? I wish there was a bit more electric guitar. The two silly tracks are ""Try It"" and ""Elevated Observations,"" where they blather about ""the astral plane"" and promise that ""you'll find your head."" It is amusing how Bernie Calvert imitates the bass guitar style of the Byrds' Chris Hillman on ""Observations."" If you like ""King Midas in Reverse,"" buy this album."
3,Listen to it twice,"Some of the better tracks come later on the album. You have to already be a Hollies fan before listening to this, otherwise get the greatest hits first...and if you're not a Hollies fan at least be a fan of the albums that came out in 67-68. This is probably their best album, which is saying something as they were not much an album group. This is more of a Graham Nash vehicle. I liked it better on the second listen. Don't let Dear Eloise scare you, while its ""the hit"" it is not the best thing on here. And yes, I am a huge Hollies fan, no one could sing like that."
4,Great Album by a Great Artist,"If you don't know Callahan, ""Sometimes I Wish I Were An Eagle"" might be a better place to start. It's a less dense and more fully realized album. Eagle has a straightforward, mature clarity where this album is cased in a darker atmosphere. Callahan is a master songwriter, and exerts his mastery with control and nuance. Admittedly, the deadpan, baritone vocals can make for a tough entry point; as Scott Walker once complained, ""baritone singing just puts people to sleep."" But again, he knows how to use his vocals to both guide and serve the songs."
4,Science Fiction vs. Vegas,"Science Fiction vs. Vegas. The story follows a ruined gambler on his belated quest to save himself and his family. The writing is solid and the plot exciting. The characters were a little stilted, but it's sci-fi. The story turns on the arcane power of a mythic set of Tarot cards, used to play Poker in a life-and-death game on Lake Mead. Fun stuff for Tarot enthusiasts. Not the most gripping read, but worth the journey."
2,A Let Down,"I loved Anubis Gates and several other Tim Powers novels. This book seemed to be a perfect combination for me: Powers + mystique of cards + seedy underbelly of Las Vegas... but unfortunately it failed to impress.I bought this book when it first came out. The first time I read it I felt it dragged on and didn't deliver to my expectations. Because I wanted to dive into the other 2 books of the loosely connected trilogy (Expiration date & Earthquake weather), I thought I'd give it another chance. I'm sorry to say, that it still left me wanting more. Not much really happens, especially compared to the brilliant plots of other Powers novels.Some reviewers commented about needing a sense of humor to read this. The truth is you just need to have the patience to endure really corny humor (lots of puns!). Disappointed to say the least."
4,"No Francis the Mute, but really good...",This was the first Coheed & Cambria experience I've ever had. I was pretty impressed. I've heard about them a lot but never picked anything up. I thought they would be too soft. I like harder more angry music. If you are a fan of The Mars Volta or Rush I would suggest this CD...
2,Good bad.....horrible singer,Why do they ruin decent music with such girly sounding singing? Just don't get it.
1,"Sing about whatever you want, but dont bore me!","After their last CD, I was expecting much, but end up being majorly disapointed. I have to mention the story everyone loves to gush about. Its retarded. I mean, really stupid, Claudio writes himself into the story with a different last name (how dumb is that?), and then goes on and on about killing everyone. This kid needed some love when he was younger. Anyway, I really dont care about the stupid story, I care about the music, you can sing about the muppets for all I care as long as it sounds good. The last CD sounded original and rocked hard. this CD is boring, each song sounds the same, none of them really get going. Skip this one and hope the band quits writing lyrics and starts writing songs again."
3,3.5 Actually,"This is a pretty good album. I'd have to say that this is my favorite from this band and the production is top notch, allowing every element their space within the mix. I still find the lead singer's voice a tad annoying. It's got that munchkin meets a warbling bird (tons of vibrato to his voice). I like the overall super-geek concept of the band and the songs. I also like the little touches of sound design used throughout the album that give it more of an epic feel.However, these guys are no Mars Volta (especially ""De Loused""), and yet they somehow make a nice companion, more rockish type quality. Definitely something you need to spin a few time to begin to appreciate it's overall artistic merit."
4,Great toy - not enough trax,We just bought this toy for our son's 2nd birthday. We thought that since he loves cars he would like having a track to play with them on. He also loves Mega Blocks so what a great idea when I found the Fast Trax toy. My son LOVES it and plays with it alot but just like all the other reviews it needs more trax. We also got him the garage but my husband took the trax from it and added it to the Fast Trax. Mega Blocks really needs to sell more trax to this toy. But overall it is very sturdy and my son loves it. The cars are really cool too!!
3,Quick and Easy,"I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read and I like that, although it's set in the present, it deals with Shakespeare. I agree with what other reviewers have said, that other recent mysteries written for this age group are more engaging. Still, an enjoyable read."
4,An Engrossing Mystery,This is from my 10 year old who read this: The author did a great job writing this; the mystery kept me guessing until the end. I highly recommend it!
4,Shakespeare's Secret,"My daughter, age 10, and I both enjoyed reading this book. It gets off to a bit of a slow start, but it is an excellent story once one gets into it. This is a good choice for a ""non-scary"" mystery book report."
3,Can't Buy Me Love,"I think Can't Buy Me Love is just one of the cutest movies. I think the move should be re-released. I have been looking to buy a copy, and can't find one anywhere. Please re-release this wonderfully cute movie!"
5,Can't Buy Me Love movie,"This movie was for my fiance's sister, she loved the movie but never owned it. So I bought this for her for Christmas. She loved it!! Shipment on this movie was quick, and the price was great!!"
5,No Ronald McDonald scams here,"This movie reminds J-Abs of high school. You may be saying J-Abs were you picked on like this in high school. Did someone throw flaming bags of poo at your door. Heck no loser. J-Abs was ten times cooler than the cool jocks in this movie. Heck J-Abs invented delivering pizza to hot women and making them want extra anchovies. To even think J-Abs was Ronald McDonald should be grounds for an immediate butt kicking, but J-abs is feeling nice today so he will let you read the rest of this review. So anyway Ronald Miller is this ultra cool guy who likes this nerdy chick and decides that out of the goodness of his heart he will make her cool by hanging out with her. You know what, this movie was based on J-Abs life story. I have seen no royalities on this. This review is done until I gets paid. J-Abs out!"
4,Live and learn,"A fun, funny, and learning about life & love. Definitely one to keep around.Recommended for those romantics and near romantics alike. I still enjoy this movie!"
2,Why no widescreen?,I agree with all those who disaprove of the pan and scan DVD that has been released. I love this movie but will not buy it until it is available in widescreen.
5,Highly recommended,"Be my guest and watch this emotional film. The old man is the directors father, who is a director of famous films, too. Be prepared for the scene when the little boy phones his grandmother. That one scene is still strong in my memory. I rented the film first, then bought it. This is not one you would find at the local rental store. You have to use Netflix.com and the like. Again, do not let the sub titles scare you away. The film is so well acted that you may not need to read them."
5,Too adorable,"This movie was very touching. I loved the suspense of not knowing what will happen to the man or the boy. Very well acted, especially by the little boy. You just want to pinch his cheeks. And I love his nickname, ""Kolya."" I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a good movie with a happy ending. Its also a good movie for anyone just venturing into foreign films. This one is very easy to swallow."
2,A Colossal Disappointment,"After 35 minutes, I told my wife that, except for the scenery and the music, this could be a Hollywood movie. It tries to evolve beyond that, and it's watchable enough, but it never reaches the ranks of being memorable, much less literature. Once it reaches the requisite length, it introduces a political event that I guess we can't call ""deus ex machina"" because it actually happened. But that's how they end the story and go home. But in the end, we've got crusty codger, cute kid, bonding, blah blah blah. I know the Czechs have better movies. Why aren't we seeing them? It's a sad day when any European nation neglects its rich cultural heritage to try copying the literary equivalent of Big Macs."
5,Kolya-Comedy,"Really funny movie about a Czech who marries a Russian. She marries the Czech to get ""status"" in his country (familiar story?)Complications ensue. Things go haywire from there.It's really good. We enjoyed it."
2,"Poorly designed box... 1/2"" from being prefect","I purchased this case for my Milwaukee grinder. I was thrilled when I found it because most of Milwaukee's cases today are the plastic style which don't give you much room for extras. When I got it, it looked perfect. Its dimensions are 14-1/2 x 12 x 4-3/4"". The grinder fits in angled, and slightly offset in order to accommodate the side handle, and there's plenty of extra storage space for anything you have. I put my grinder and accessories in the case, everything looked perfect... that is, until I tried to close the cover. The edge of the side handle sticks up about 1/2"" too high and there's no way to close it with the handle attached. I contacted Milwaukee who told me that I would have to remove the handle to store the tool, which is not very practical, especially since the case looks to be offset in order to accommodate the side handle. If the case was 1/2"" taller, it would fit perfectly. Doesn't make any sense to me."
2,rewriting history,"While Mars on Earth does provide an overview of the accomplishments of the Mars Society, a word of caution about the details provided is in order. Having only made it to page 40, I've already discovered quite a few inaccuracies in Dr. Zubrin's version of events. Some are clearly just a case of his not remembering but many of them seem to be designed to rewrite how events transpired in an effort to improve his own image."
5,Just do it,Hemmed and hawed over the price. Finally had to buy one for a class that didn't want me to use the General I got at Home Depot for a about 1/5 the price. The Starrett is finally worth the money. The quality difference is huge. It will be the last one you buy.
4,Way too small,"This jersey is of excellent quality - good fabric and nice bright colors. I read the reviews and sized up one size accordingly (ordered an XL), and it is still too tight and too short. I wear a size 12 and order either a medium or large; I'm used to cycling clothes being fitted, but this is uncomfortable for me. I would recommend it to someone no larger than a size 10 - and to order the XL."
3,bicycle riding shirt,i love the colors and design of this shirt.however i usually wear a medium and i ordered a large for room to wear a long sleeve under it and it is still to snug.overall its a nice shirt
1,Utter Trash,"I was required (really!) to read this book for a graduate class. This book is full of nothing but jealous ramblings. Lady Campbell seems to be dredging the bottom of the proverbial lake to find the nastiest details possible about Diana. Her personal comments dispersed throughout the book are not only unprofessional in the writing sense but also unnecessary. The storyline gets very confusing at times, jumping from one subject to another - a hard read. True, Diana was a spoiled brat, but let the woman rest in peace! Lady Campbell is no lady!"
4,A different view of the Princess,I am enjoying this book and appreciate that it is more about the younger Diana than other books I haveread. And it reveals more about the Prince and Princess life together in ways I haven't read in otherbooks.
4,A real page turner!,"Purity is the second installment of the Dangerous Virtue series. While searching for her orphaned sisters she falls for Pale Wolf; a mysterious half breed Indian who has bushwhacked her trail drive. Together they face an adventurous jouney of events that bond them for life.This was my first Elaine Barbieri book and it was wonderful. I feared it would be another Cassie book, too much mush. But, I was wrong. This was a very interesting book and had plenty of action. Purity is not just a little white virgin beauty, you can actually relate to her. Nor does the Indian drool after her, like in most white-Indian relationship books. This was more realistic. Alot of steamy scenes. I have in turn purchased all of Ms. Barbieri books, she is a very creative and passionate writer."
3,Short factual account,"I enjoyed this short, factual account of Cleveland's life and presidency, but found it a little lacking in details. While it is an easy read and covers all of the key points, it fails to really describe Cleveland as a person or to articulate his political philosophy. Interesting personal tidbits such as his close relationship with his Quaker mom, his Christian faith, marriage to the much younger Frances, and an out-of-wedlock child are mentioned in passing with little explanation or speculation. Similarly, Graff mentions Cleveland's strong support of the gold standard, his anti-imperialism, his opposition to the tariff, and belief in limited government, but he fails to connect the dots and explain how these views connect. Given that the modern libertarian movement has adopted Cleveland as a model president, it would have been interesting to know whether Graff shares their view of Cleveland as a classical laissez faire liberal."
4,Good Read,These Schlesinger books are good reads on the presidents. This one was no exception. I think it covered everything one would want to know about President Cleveland. I felt it was the right length and it did not drag on and on. I would recommend one to read it.
3,Not for me . . . .,The only problem I have with books by this author is with her diagrams. Usually too many and often very confusing. Would prefer to see fewer but definitely clearer diagrams without swirls and whizzy bits that mean I have to spend too much time trying to work out what she wants me to do.
4,EPISODE 1 CLARENET REWIEW,"I HIGHLY RECOMEND THE EPISODE 1 CLARANET SONG BOOK FOR 2 REASONS . 1 - IT HAS GREAT ,EASY-TO-READ MUSIC THAT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO PLAY, PLUS A CD THAT REALY HELPS ON THOSE TRICKY SONGS.2 - IT FIANALLY BRINGS THOSE SONGS WE KNOW AND LOVE TO LIFE. THIS BOOK IS SO GREAT, YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF HUMMING ALL DAY THOSE GREAT SONGS YOU NOW CAN PLAY ON YOUR CLARANET:] !"
4,Worked for only 3 years!,I bought this product back when I had a house and had A huge mouse problem! I spent so much on mouse traps but I hated having to throw them little creatures away! I finally decided enough is enough and gave it a shot. within a couple of DAYS my husband said he could literally hear the mice running away and when we moved out a few months later did not see anymore at all! I used it at my next place where i lived for 2 years and never saw or heard a mouse and I loved it! I just moved to a different apt and I just saw a mouse in my pantry. So I guess it stops working after so long. I'm considering getting a new one cause I cant stand to know there is one in my apt!! THEY WORK BRAND NEW THOUGH! ILL PAY FOR 1 EVERY YEAR IF I HAVE TO JUST TO NOT DEAL WITH THEM!!
4,Great for the money,This table is great for the money! The quality and size are perfect. I only gave it 4 stars thought because it wobbles a tiny bit.
5,A first-class thriller,"This book has everything. Great characters, whom I would love to hang out with, especially Alice, Michael, Vera and Brother Rose. Great scenery in Nepal, Norway and back in the States and a great, twisting and everchanging plot. Love all the science too.When's the next book coming!"
5,Perfect tap shoes for tiny student,Shoes are exactly what is required to keep a little girl interested and comfortable with a budding dance career.
4,Brazilian pop-disco vocals,"Eva""Eva""(EMI-Odeon, 1974) (Brazil)-----------------------------------------Brazilian disco-era pop vocals, with a light touch of soul. The song ""Vinte Leguas"" has a fairly funky feel to it, but the rest of the record is pretty mainstream. Includes an English-language disco remake of Henri Mancini's ""Moon River,"" for extra kitsch value. She had a pretty voice, though: for Brazilian ""brega"" (cheesy) pop, this is pretty good. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
1,Didn't work,Non-OEM parts sometimes just don't work. This almost ruined the engine on my car. Beware! As in reveiws of replacement parts ordered online you should expect them toot be of the quality as OEM parts.
2,Poor blade,"The voice recorder is a neat idea, but to be useful to carpenters the blade has to be of a much better quality. About a week or less after I received the Repeater the blade would'nt completely retract.There was a slight tear in the blade about an inch or so up the blade. I have stanley tapes that lasted 1 or 2 years before the blade tore."
1,This is a piece of junk,"I thought this would be a great idea, but it is a piece of junk. The tape is flimsy and uncoated, so the markings on the first few feet have rubbed off. I tried to continue using it just as a voice recorder, but it soon stopped working; the replay was too faint to hear. So, I spent 8 bucks (!) to replace the four watch batteries it uses. It still didn't work. As for replacing the blade, I don't even know where I could get a replacement from. So, I am out about thirty bucks, and I am very disappointed. Thirty bucks is a lot to pay for an archery target..."
3,It's not bad,"I like the light with it, I like the 9x mirror. I just thought it would be a little flatter and lighter (as in weigh less). But it's not bad."
1,Just OK- Mirror Distorted,"Bought this as a Christmas gift because of the reviews. Everything is as described, but the magnifying mirror is distorted, and you have to get very close to the mirror and close one eye to see clearly. I was disappointed, but Amazon did return and refund without any problem!"
5,Good product!,"Interactive language tool in a 2-CD ROM set, that really helps you conquer the basics of French! It included dozens of exercises and games, 14 integrated in-depth lessons, plus a dictionary, travel resources, and much more."
3,B-,"picked up a few things but all in all was looking for licks that could be used in diff situations, as opposed more rigid structures..."
2,"Excellent View of Venice, Lousy Plot","I love books by Pears, Swan, Reverte, and Hill, and wanted to add Dibdin to my list. But somehow this book did not quite live up to those expectations. I thought Dibdin did a fine job of recreating Venice for the reader (although one more reference to Zen having some type of coffee and grappa...). However, I never found myself caring one way or the other about the so-called mystery. At one point he solves the ""ghost"" story, only to be told to forget it by the offended party. The various plot lines were as various and meandering as the canals of Venice, which were all wound up into what amounts to too neat an ending. I may read another Zen mystery but not for awhile, and not until I'm at a loss for another book."
2,Dead Lagoon -- Dead Book,"This is the first Dibdin/Zen book I've tried and I found it wanting. I didn't feel I got to know Zen like I got to know Brunetti in Donna Leon's supberb Venice books. Maybe he's just not as likeable as Brunetti. And I found the plot someone artificial. And, as another reviewer noted, Dibdin's Venice must be awfully small because Zen keeps running into people he knows. I guess, in a nutshell, the plot didn't reach out and grab me. All in all, a disappointment."
2,miniature print,The print in this book is so small that it is impossible to read without getting a headache. Try another way of getting this book.
2,"Great Headphones, if you dont mind replacing them in 6 months","So as others have said, these are great sounding headphones but they are prone to breaking due to poor design. The speaker section of mine broke off of at the point where they connect to the headband. There also seems to be something rattling around inside one of the speakers."
4,The love of a cowboy,I enjoyed this book. It isn't one that I could not put down but it was good. A little predictable.
4,The Love of a Cowboy,This was the first ebook i have ever purchased. My Kindel was very new and i needed a light read to get me from reading a book to reading a book on the kindel.This was a perfect choice it was a really light read and a really enjoyable romance.
4,Good read.,"A number of editing issues throughout the text, but still a good read and, as written by at least one other reviewer, non-formulaic in a good way."
4,B10,The Buffet B10 is a much better clarinet than the student name gives to it. This is a clarinet that could easily take you through the learning process and into high school level music. I would recommend an E11 for the more advanced player and for college level players. I find the E10 plays almost as good as an E11 but is more durable and a bit brighter in sound.
3,the old Irish believe in fairies,"While I love Katherine Mary's own story, ""Mrs. Mike"" this book was just so sad and depressing. The author says in the beginning that this is a true story based upon her Aunt, around 1870, in Ireland. Mrs. Kelleen's son, Rory, is sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit. He is her only living relative, and the story goes down from there. She does everything she can to get her son released, but ends up dying. However, that is not the end of her trying - she 'haunts' the judge, the murderer, her son, and others involved - but not in a bad way because she was a good and kind person. While the story has a 'happy' ending, and I loved reading about the Old Emerald Isle, the book didn't make me feel good at all."
4,Took me by surprise,"Music: 8/10 Vocals: 4/5 Lyrics: 4/5 Production: 4/5Total: 20/25: BApples in Stereo have been around since at least 1995. I'm surprised I haven't heard of them sooner. They are a very eclectic powerpop band. On this album, they tend to morph and emulate various styles. I don't know if this is their trademark or not. But, they move from straight ahead guitar pop rock, to Elvis, to the Beatles, to 70s hippie jams, and everything else. It takes a bit to get used to moving in and out of styles, but most of the songs are very good with only one or two that could have been left off the album.For me the two standouts are ""7 Stars"" and ""Radiation"" which kind of are similar to the poppier side of Smashing Pumpkins like ""1979"" and ""Rocket"". But there plenty of other solid tracks on this one. It won't blow you away, but it's extremely solid and worth a listen."
2,Bad (But I Bought It Anyway),"I'm a completist at heart, and I only bought this because I needed the entire discography of the Apples in Stereo to fill up my music collection. I love the Apples in Stereo, but this is definitely not one of their best albums. If you're only a casual listener to their music, this album is not for you. Even if you already have two or three of their other albums, this one probably is not for you. Only buy it if you absolutely, positively, must have every song the ever performed. (That described me and that's the only real reason I bought it.) Otherwise, you wouldn't be missing much if you skipped this and went for some of their other CDs, such as Fun Trick Noisemaker or Her Wallpaper Reverie."
4,"Great Calculator,But !","I have been using my inchmate calculator for 10 years extensivly in my job as a mechanical designer. It is a great calculator and very fast. It helps me in adding and subtracting dimensions for layout of construction documents. The one I have does not have the rise, run, and slope features but square and square root keys acheive the same results just a little slower. The only improvement that the manufacturer could enhance for this calculator is the incorporation of sine, cosine, and tangent keys for trigonometric calculations. These features would win a five plus star rating for this already great calculator."
3,Works until it breaks,"This is a good variable grip clamp, you just slide the grip up the shaft for larger clamping. However, mine broke after a dozen or so uses, the handles should be reinforced with metal to handle the pressure of squeezing them to open the clamp. I can still use it but have to grip the handle up higher. I tried to glue the dangling part of the handle but it didn't stay. I will next reinfoce with a piece of metal and tape it inside the handle. If it hadn't broken I would have given it more stars."
2,I wasn't looking for a professional guitar but....,I was looking for a toy guitar for my two and a half year old. I did not want something expensive as well....he's two and a half. I did want something that was real looking as he was very into having his own guitar. I saw reviews for this and similarly priced guitars stating the sound quality was bad. I did not care too much about that as (again) he's two and a half. Ordered it and am incredibly disappointed. One string was completely off the guitar on arrival and could not be tightened. I removed it before giving it to my son. Within 1 hour of playing with it (not rough just happy strumming) two more strings had slipped off to the point of having to be removed. I guess you get what you pay for -- I did not expect a concert ready guitar but I would have liked it if the strings stayed on for more than 1 day....
2,Overrated...don't get fooled by the National Book Award,"Considerable hype on this book particularly after it won the National Book award. Save your time and money and pass on it. Book is choppy. Story line is somewhat disjointed. Writing is superb in areas and thin and transparent in others. Strongly suggest you move to Marianne Wiggins book...Evidence of Things Unseen, which was a National Book Award finalist in the same year."
3,Over-rated,"This is an ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful novel. The theme is the effort to recapture life after the chaos and destruction of WWII. The answer appears to be love, particularly a sort of very romanticized, relatively selfless form of romantic love. The primary character is a British writer in love with a teenage girl. His character is contrasted with a friend who is also searching for some authenticity in his life. The theme is certainly worthwhile.Unfortunately, while Hazzard is certainly a skillful writer, her skills are deployed in a way that makes this book unattractive. Her highly allusive prose has a generally flat quality and becomes monotonous despite her attempts to engage a variety of characters and situations. Her characters and not particularly engaging, a major defect in a novel with a large psychological component."
4,Good Book To Get You in the Reality,"If you're a good expert behind the scenes whether it be music editing, producing, mixing, directing, composing and arranging. This book will give you all the ins and outs you need to do what it takes. Jeff Rona does a remarkable job staying in real depth what goes down. I finally got real familiar what what I learn off this book.For people who like to learn more, check Roger McGuinn's DVD on Home Recording, e.g.Roger McGuinn's Guide To Home Recording on a Computer,Billboard Guide to Home Recording,How to Be a Working Musician: A Practical Guide to Earning Money in the Music Business, andStudio Basics: What You Should Know Before Going Into the Recording Studio"
2,Poor quality even for the low price,There are many cons to this product.1. poor quality in every components2. very poor assemble instructions3. ridability is poor not smooth at allspend a little more money and buy something better
1,terrible delivery condition,1000 sheets of paper put in a bag twice the size of the paper. All 1000 sheets loose. Delivered all bent up and damp. Can't believe it.
2,There are better deals,"First, the positive.I like the one piece molded steel.Now for the negative.Eleven inches and 14.5 oz. That is smaller than most hammers. Even the handle is a little hard to get a grip on. It's also impossible to tell how slim the head is from the pics. It looks like a bulky hatchet, but it is actually VERY thin. I didn't realize it would be so small. If space or weight is a concern, this is a nice hatchet. If you need something to put out a little work, try something else. I'm still a little upset at how small it is, but the weight is in the description, so I guess it's my own fault for not noticing. This axe should be called the ""Kershaw Jr. camp axe.""Overall, it was a bust. There are better deals (and tools) for the money out there. This will be the last tool I order from the internet without first holding it in my hand at a store."
5,"5 stars for Elvira, negative 10 for greedy dvd producers!","As a person who has paid full price for all the titles listed in this set, i wonder why not be original and add something new to this set?Wonder if they are gonna fix the sound issues on I Eat Your Skin? Knowing that eventually this set will be less than $20.00 and thinking about what i paid really leaves a bad taste in my mouth, love Elvira, as my bank account can attest to, but this makes me NOT wanna buy the titles as they come out and just wait for them to be sold in bulk like this set, at a HUGE discount.So good news for new buyers and big screw you to loyal customers."
5,My favorite,"I've been using only these even since trying them, wonderful picks for speed and precision, you won't go back for sure."
4,Good Value,"I ordered the item with 2-day shipping selected, but the item was delivered within 24 hours so that was a nice surprise. The mount itself looks good and seems well-built. The only downside is that the installation was a bit confusing. There are no written instructions provided, only engineering-type diagrams. Took me a while to decipher all of the pictures (and find the stud in my ceiling), but I was able to install it myself in one afternoon. It swivels, tilts, and rotates to virtually any position. It does not have an up/down telescoping movement, but I have low ceilings and a 32"" panel so I like it where it is. Ultimately, a flat-panel ceiling mount (+ free DIY installation) for $100 seems like a bargain to me."
3,dog shampoo,"Works ok but since you have to leave it on for 10 minutes or longer, I don't use that often since my dog gets antsy."
2,Coolaroo 11 Foot Umbrella,"The umbrella's mesh-like material neither totally blocks the sun nor fully stops rainfall. It's utility as an umbrella is therefor limited, especially living in a place like Arizona. It does seem to be made very well though but I wish I had known about the material."
5,Love this umbrella,"I love this umbrella. Infact, I bought 2! Combined, it gives wonderful shade to my backyard, but does not black out the sun. Makes the outside at least 10 degrees cooler. It is perfect for me. I also like the wind section at the top. The other day, we had winds up to 25mph, and the umbrellas withstood without any problems. The fabric is very good, and the item is well made. I expect this to last for years to come. I would buy more of these."
1,Cheap parts!,I brought this umbrella a month ago and it already broke. The metal piston on the 3 position tilt broke. the Umbrella is now worthless after a short use. I should have bought it in Costco!
3,"For product managers, not marketers","This book would be more accurately titled, ""Product Management for Technical Companies"" because it addresses actual marketing only in small portions. If you are an engineer who is moving to a product management role, the content seems adequate. You will also like the extensive use of management flow charts, data graphs, spreadsheets that illustrate key concepts."
5,The Textbook for Product Marketing -- from a PMM,"A good tactical primer on the relatively new field of Product Marketing. I would consider the first 4 chapters more of an overview of Product Management. This is useful because PMMs typically work VERY closely with PMs, and it's crucial to understand what they do and how they do it. But if you're a PMM, you should start with Chapters 5 & 6, and then go back to read the rest.Keep in mind that this is very dry reading. Again, it's a textbook, not ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" or ""The Goal."" But it will tell you succinctly what you need to know to get started on the road to success as a PMM. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,Good Overview...too short?,"I enjoyed this quick read about one of my favorite presidents. The book is interesting and Brands is a fine historian. This book is a solid introduction, but left me wanting more depth about this great man. But then again, that may be the point of this series."
4,Vintage Biddu,"The first hearing made me fall in love with it. There are not too many artists in Indian pop music inddustry who can grab my attention this way. From his early disco music of late 70's to producing one of India's successful pop artist, he has certainly given a new meaning to Indian pop music. Coming back to the album itself, it has a Biddu stamp on it. This is by no means his best album. But miles ahead of the modern pop that is being played on radio and TV today. If you have not heard this artist before, I strongly urge you to. His music is certainly classified as fusion. But unlike other fusion albums, his music is simple, pure, and soulful. This album will make you tap your feet and take you through a mystic journey. If you want to know what I mean here, buy and listen to the album. You will understand why."
3,"Awesome toy, but for older toddlers","We love this ride-on toy but hoped our 13 month old would like it better. She's just started walking and not sure what to do with it. She seems to really find it intriguing, but due to the handle not being higher, she can't really roll it around much.The toy isn't really intended as a push toy, but would love it to be so.. I'm sure she'll have fun with it in a few months when she can ride on it.. can't wait to see her on it!"
5,Love love love it!,Got this for my son for his 1st birthday. He is really small but is still able to use it. The biggest surprise was my 4 years old who has problems with gross motor skills loves it too! He still can't ride a tricycle and has trouble with other ride on toys but he has no problem with this one. I really love it (my kids do too) and they are even cuter than they look in the pictures.
4,"Very cute, not as large as I expected.","I have very tall children. My 9 month old baby is wearing 2T clothes and they fit...so I purchased the large size. His feet don't hit the ground, but he has to bend over to hold the handle bars, and especially when he stands to push it, he practically has to bend in half. I can't imagine how small the small size must be. Everything about this toy is just about perfect except for the height of the handlebars. I would like them to be about 4 inches higher. I think they would still be comfortable for most babies, I've noticed in most of the pictures, the babies hands are reaching pretty far down to grab the bar, so I don't think it's just because my baby is tall. I LOVE that the wheels turn so easily. They toy is much lighter weight than I expected, which is nice. It's still heavy enough to keep baby from getting ahead of himself. All in all, I love this and would recommend it. It's attractive and fun. Four stars only for handlebar height."
3,no interest: size problem?,"Unforunately, although I believe the design is nice and it rolls well, this toy did not catch the interest of my son. As many previous reviews commented on, there seems to be a size problem. So my son's data: he is 15 months old, and 31in tall, and the small bug is appaently too small for him: when I put him on it, hejust steps off. But perhaps he is not that much into sit-on wheeling toys; a plastic toy is a bit more popular with him, but he does not get really enthusiastic either."
5,WE Love Wheely Bug!,"This toy is like another member of the family. Our son rides him at least several times a day. He can't get enough of him. We have the large one, and he got it for his 2nd bday--it fits fine! He loves how fast he can go, and how it spins around at will. We highly recommend this toy, and have been complemented so much on it."
3,THE SMALL WAS TOO SMALL,"I ORDERED THE SMALL WHEELY BUG, BUT I SHOULD OF PAID ATTENTION TO OTHERS WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS TOO SMALL. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY ONE YEAR OLD GRANDSON, AND EVEN THOUGH HE STILL COULDN'T REACH THE GROUND IT WAS STILL TOO SMALL. THE REASON HE COULDN'T REACH THE GROUND WAS BECAUSE THE BODY OF THE TOY IS SO WIDE, THAT HE STRUGGLED EVEN TO SIT ON TOP OF IT, IT KEPT THROWING HIM TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. I ENDED UP SENDING IT BACK."
3,"Wheely Bug, Tiger","It was as presented. Cute and sturdy enough for a first birthday gift. A little smaller than I expected ,and while it was seemingly enjoyed, I would advise the larger size for a child to get more use out of going forward."
5,"Unlikely, but effective","Rarely has a performer been able to sing so effectively through his nose.Seriously, much as I love Arlo, his voice definitely did not ""make"" him. Nevertheless, I grew up with this album (seriously; our LP is older than I am) and it's great. The fun songs are fun, and the serious songs are sincere."
5,Excellent,"With Vol. 3, the best of the series. This volume has some awesome individual tracks like Rain and Rise Above The Storm. However, I wish the album flowed better as a whole. Overall, a highly recommended purchase."
5,Wonderful classic long past time for it to have been released,"So much good music on one CD. This is the first ""Galveston"" and the best. ""Love Hurts"", ""Hurt Me Well"", ""Campo Del Encino"" are all classic Webb. Is it at his best? I'm really hoping the best is yet to come. Really wish this had been re-mastered, but the sound is still very good on this CD."
1,quiet crystal radio kit!,"I've assembled, disassembled, and reassembled the crystal radio kit from Go Labs. Sadly, I've not heard a sound from the radio!I second the comment already made that the instructions are not well written. There is an instruction to remove the insulation off of a wire that is already bare, and another to insert a wire into two different slots in the base of the radio. There is no troubleshooting section."
5,A Night in Terror Tower.,"The main characters are eddie and sue. they whet to London,England on a bus.Than got Lase in the terror tower.eddie and sne runer from the caped man.He grip Them and Lock Them up in the dungeon.The king sorceror come in There to Talk to The kid .The guards came in and said The kid were to be Beharded. I Like The book because it was very serry."
3,"Play with it one minute, bored the next","I got this because it was new to me, and I was pretty sure that I was going to play with it. But two days later, it was sitting on my shelf, getting dusty. My 8 year old sister is getting the whole set, but now she does not really want it anymore. So, the point is, I don't like it very much, and it is BORING!"
5,Classic design - useful size,These little bowls nest perfectly. They hold 2/3 cup liquid in the bowl portion (up to the edge). I'm using them for fruit (of course) and for ice cream. Two average scoops look quite generous.
4,Awesome product - dog may try to chew it,"Other reviewers have summed it up very nicely. Great price and design, sturdy and nice grip - it feels like I'm bringing my dog a breakfast in bed every time. I decided to go with a feeder because it's been said that it's good for dog's posture and makes him eat more slowly, which it does.I caught my puppy (who is still teething) chewing the corner and the plastic exterior suffers a bit. Thankfully the almost black color hides the defect. Now I only leave him with it during meal times. Other times, I use ceramic bowl for his water, which he doesn't dare to trip because the noise scares him."
3,China Cheap,Nice looking food and water server but cheaply made. The particle board surround was put on with the rough side up and the painted side down. The bowls look great but metal is thin enough bend easily with bare hands. It will serve the pupose but I wouldn't do it again and don't recommend it.
4,the Kitties love it,"Nice way to contain the food and water in one spot. My cats would push their old bowls all over the kitchen. They seem to like the height of the platform. I like the height also as it is easier for me, a wheelchair user, to reach and remove the water dish for cleaning and refilling. It is a decent looking addition to the kitchen."
4,Nice!,"Good quality and product is as described.Seems a bit pricy, that's what kept it frombeing 5 stars. Would recommend."
2,Bowls too small,We wanted a tall feeding system because we have a very large dog. Having a large dog means he eats a lot. The bowls that came with this were half the size of the ones we were using. It is just not what we needed.
2,Needed to be proof-read!!,"While the ideas, instructions and general content is very good, the actual recipes are full of errors.While I was reading the instructions for one of the sabbat soaps I noticed an ingredient not mentioned in the recipe. I flipped back to the list of ingredients and sure enough, the ingredient was not listed. It's as if the author forgot an ingredient in the recipe and decided to add it in during the soap making instructions. After encountering this problem twice I decided to quit reading.I have decided to return my copy."
4,A Delightful Little Book,"I'm a real fan of Alicia's books....they're my soaping ""bibles"" so to speak. If I am unsure of how to proceed on a recipe, I open this book, or the ""Everything Soapmaking Book"" first. I haven't been let down yet.This book is an interesting departure, and a unique approach to soapmaking. I find it very spiritual, and wonderful.Alicia's writing is unpretentious, her directions and safety guidelines are good, and the recipes produce nice soap. Her charts on essential oils and additives are worth the small price of this book with nothing else!Another plus is that it gives a great introduction to the spiritual aspect of soapmaking. There's nothing bad here, just an earthy, loving approach to a craft that deserves a lot of respect. A fun variaton of the art of soaping, and a very worthy read!"
3,No hocus pocus for me,"No hocus pocus for me. Could of done with out the jibberish. Has some good recipes, will see how they come out I would not recommend this book as a favorite."
1,A Misjudgement of the Mojahedin,The Mojahedin-e-khalgh have been recognised as the most supported opposition group to the present Regime and the old Monarchy Regime. hat does this imply? It implies that this book has unjust motives. It has been purely written to wrongly downgrade the Mojahedin. Its a complete waste of time to read.
2,Needs glasses,"It works! The only problem is that it needs glasses because in an open wall test we found that it found the stud sometimes one inch before it started and stopped seeing it one inch after it stopped. In the case of metal, it saw even wider (cross-eyed maybe) and saw a 3/4 copper pipe as 4 inches wide. My old Zircon was more precise and so was the newer Pro SL."
1,Tends to be inaccurate...,"I have tried using this unit for almost a yearbut I have finally given-up. It is usually off by around 4 inches. If I had known that I could get more accuracy with a cheapo no-name brand, I would not have bought this unit from this professional-wanna-be manufacturer."
2,This Book is Mis-titled,"This book was given to me as a gift by a well-meaning family member who knew I was getting into the sleeker side of paddling after being passed by too many kayaks while paddling a canoe.The title would lead any sane person to believe that this book is indeed a good beginners book for general kayaking.It is not.It is, in fact, a highly specialized book for white water kayaking. It's also fairly terse, the bulk of it being made up of photographs.For someone like me who is more interested in flat water, slow rivers, protected marine waterways, and coastal swamps this book is nearly useless. Keep looking.The title and subtitle of this book are incredibly deceiving and are a disservice to readers who might not know better until they get a few pages into the book and realize what they got stuck with."
1,Basic Kayaking,"The title, sub-title, cover, and table of contents are all absolutely misleading. This is about white-water kayaking, but it isn't stated as such. A fine example of how one can't judge a book by its cover. I'll never buy any book from this publishing house again."
2,Good timing but POOR film!,I purchased the film to use at my wedding. Although I received it quickly and have no complaints on timing or shipment.The photos came out horribly. All the photos are yellowish and have no definition. I tried a different package hoping to get better results with no luck.I am very disappointed considering this was purchased for such a special event.
4,"Good buy, but expensive",We bought these to create a picture curtain of all of our incoming employees for the season. The film works great...kind of pricey...about a $1-$1.50 per employee...so it adds up with a lot of employees.
2,The Plot??,"I just finished reading The Hours and I found it very depressing.Also, What was the PLOT?? Women are depressed and they sometimes commit suicide? I am sorry but I did not like this book.I admit it is beautifully written, but it fails to entertain. A really gook book, not as well written, but one I liked more was ""Sing Me A Bawdy Song."""
1,Coffee House Blues,"When I read, I hear the voice of the narrator in my mind. As I read ""The Hours"", the voice I heard was that of a ""pretentious offbeat hippie"", putting on airs in a coffee house of the 60's. My impressions may have been intended by the author, since much of his tale describes characters of the period, who populated the coffee houses of New York's Greenwich Village and the Near North side of Chicago of my own youth. That the author was a Pulitzer Prize winner surprised me. The book dragged initially, and I found myself wondering how one could make a movie of it. It is definitely not my cup of tea."
3,Over the top,"The writing is great to the point that it is just too much. You have long flowing paragraphs filled with description after description. None of it's really necessary. The story was intriguing, and the last 40 pages or so kept me reading until the end. But take away the fluff, and what you have is a completely mediocre book."
5,amazing,"The Hours is an amazing piece of work. Some reviewer down below stated that this was bold but not original because it was a copy of Woolf. I think, if anything, this book is original. It is a tribute to Woolf's genius, yes, but the story itself is all Cunningham's. The writing style, the themes, the portrayal of characters, while being similar to those in Woolf's works, are very much Cunningham's own.This book is really something-- I strongly recommend it to anyone who's got a few hours on his hands. :)"
3,Not my cup of tea,"I have great respect for the fact that this book was probably brilliant, but for whatever reason, I could never get into it. It probably has something to do with the fact that there wasn't a whole lot going on. The book is primarily about relationships, and the nature of these relationships is revealed through a look inside the heads of the three protaganists, not through any action, or even much dialogue. Fortunately, it is short, so I was able to read the entire thing, despite my lack of enthusiasm. I did regret my half-hearted effort at the end, when a neat twist revealed itself. It probably didn't help that I haven't read the Virginia Wolff book ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Apparently, more brilliance would have been apparent to me if I had had some familiarity with that work as well."
3,A whole new way of writing,"When I first picked up this Pulitzer prize winner, I was impressed by its rotating chapter titles. The stories of three women from three different decades were told in an intertwined fashion. The style is noval, but the complication, as a result, is sometimes beyond my comprehension. Therefore I'm rolling out a 3 stars for this book."
3,A good imitation...,"This book is beautifully written and is a very good homage or imitation of Virginia Woolf's language and style. I found the portions about her life to be the most complex and interesting; the prologue was especially moving. However, I couldn't help but notice that Cunningham wasn't as good at writing like Virginia Woolf as Virginia Woolf was. It made me want to just reach for ""The Waves"" or ""To the Lighthouse"" instead."
5,A GREAT BOOK,"I recently read this book, and I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I got really engrossed in the characters, and I felt sorry for the mother and the son. I felt like I knew them. It is definitely a great read and I loved the movie as well. I would recommend it to anyone. A GREAT READ and A MUST READ."
2,Didn't Like This Book,I really didn't think this book deserved a Pulitzer. I have read many more richer and more satisfying novels. In fact I hated the book and wish I hadn't invested the time reading it. I'm sorry
2,ick,One of the worst books I have read all year. This novel never picked up and was extremely contrived and moved at the speed of sludge. You would be much better off purchasing Mrs. Dalloway.
1,Huh?,"Did I completely miss the boat on this? UGH. What a load of drek. I got half way through, realized I didn't care about any of the characters, didn't enjoy reading a ridiculous unnecessary cluster of words over and over when it should have been written just freaking straightforwardly. I am in the minority in saying this, I know, but s-k-i-p this book!"
3,Depressing but very well written,"This is a very depressing story. I knew it was going to be when I started it, but I kept going because Michael Cunningham's prose had me hooked. He is an amazingly gifted writer, and he has created a very unique and gloomy story here.I was a bit confused with the chapters going back and forth between the three women's stories at first. After awhile I started to get to know each character and see the way he'd written it to all come out together as one.Instead of going into detail about each, I will simply say this. These are lives that are not happy, they all seem to be walking zombie-like through life and not really living it. It is very dreary.Even though this is going to have the sensitive emotional wrecks like me out there bawling, You will get an eyeful of beautiful writing as well."
3,"Good, but read the real thing too...","I liked this book but don't feel that he really brought the story, or characters together at the end, he didn't manage to finish the book off well.What I appreciate this book for, is leading me on the read 'the original' Mrs Dalloway by Woolf, which is a far superior read."
5,excellent,"he captures the moments in time, changing from one era to another and back again, simply. you can see the challenges facing these characters, who are so vividly drawn with so few words. I hope it can become a stage play sometime."
2,a long rainy day,"I have gone through it,not without prodding myself to forge ahead despite quiet boredom setting in gradually.I started reading it and thought it was well written and we might be heading into something interesting,then i just could not help feeling i did not care much for the characters. What can i say? It was a disapointing read and the ending twist was not much of a surprise. Sorry Mr. Cunningham your talent for writing and the telling of the story did not happen for me in this book."
2,Depressing story,"I read this book, based on its Pulitzer prize status and it being a feminist story, however, I was disappointed. It was very well written and had a few lovely and poetic parts, but mostly it was full of unhappy, depressed, hopeless gay people who I could not sympathize with in any way. They were either unable to accept and live with being gay or couldn't figure out how to get help or antidepressant meds. I couldn't understand what was the point of all the angst and misery. The theme seemed to be ""life is hopeless and terrible, and if you are lucky, you may get a few good hours in a lifetime"". Very big downer. I won't see the movie."
4,Better than the book it is based on,"This is the story of three women - Virginia Woolf; Mrs Brown, and 1950s housewife; and Clarissa, a book editor in the 1990s. The story is told in alternating vignettes, the connecting thread being the book 'Mrs Dalloway'. It builds slowly, carefully building the ties that bind these three very different women.In places the writing is *very* self-conciously trying and pretentious, almost unbearably so. It redeems itself, however, with some beautiful stand alone sentences, and especially the wonderfully captured sense of despair and futility felt by Laura Brown.The obvious literary style is infuriating at times, but there are some passages of true beauty, and the three seperate lives work well. This book is worth reading if well written prose is what you are after."
3,A gift for language lovers.,"THE HOURS is beautifully written. Its seamless prose is a gift for language lovers. I read several passages over and over for the sheer joy of the taste of the words. It's really three tales of the joy and sadness of the timeless human condition, about finding out how wonderful life can be, and it offers an amazing insight into the thoughts and feelings of women.--M.L. Playfair"
3,Strangely... the movie's better,"Now, there's nothing ""wrong"" with the book. Amazon's definition for 3-stars perfectly describes my opinion of the book-- it's okay. But, somehow, the movie's better... which shocks me given that I'd always been told with so many movies ""read the book, it's better."" Not the case here.I can't recall any major difference between the book and the movie. Essentially the same. Three parallel stories: Virginia Woolf writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway [a book I highly recommend, although it can be difficult], Laura Brown reading Mrs. Dalloway, and Clarissa who's ""being"" a modern day Mrs. Dalloway giving a party. And as makes perfect sense, Cunningham gives each their own chapters and goes back and forth among the three.But that movement among the three ladies works so much better visually on screen than it does verbally on paper.Again, nothing wrong with the book. I thought it was okay. But the film is overwhelmingly fantastic. Maybe not a fair comparison, but there it is."
1,Skip The Hours; read Mrs. Dalloway again,"Having thoroughly read and re-read The Hours in search of an original novel, I am beside myself with awe that the Pulitzer committee has seen fit to endorse a self-indulgent exercise in literary ventriloquism. Since he has been such an faithful imitator of her style, Mr. Cunningham might do well to remember that Woolf would not accept awards or honorary degrees for her fiction."
1,don't buy it!!,"If you like getting what see, then don't purchase this tape. I ordered one and received a cheap plastic imitation that was nothing like the picture or the description of the product. You would be much happier with the 100' version of this tape ,which I truly like, and is exactly what you get when you purchase that product."
2,"Good book, problems with Kindle version","I have owned the hard-cover version of this title for many years, and find that it is a true classic. When I recently purchased a Kindle-compatible device, this was one of the short-list of books I wanted to buy for it.After purchasing and downloading the book, I thought it was strange that the words LOOK like old ink type scanned from the pages of an old book. Testing showed that this must be some type of effect, because the words can be selected and dictionary definitions looked up. Interesting, but I'm not sure what the point of it would be.My problems started when I tried to ""Go To... Location"" to find the table of contents or other front matter of the book. For some reason EVERY time I try this, the book crashes, and the Kindle app opens another book in my library.Without the ability to navigate the book, it's worthless to me."
3,More Storybook than Coloring Book,"I bought this for my daughter who is almost three. It is a wonderful abridged version of the original story. While most kids, and adults, know only the movie version of The Wizard of Oz, this takes it's text and illustrations from the original...which is often quite different from the movie. It is a LONG read for small kids. I was hoping for more of a coloring book. This isn't it. The illustrations are pretty detailed and are more of an enhancement to the story rather than the main focus of the book. The pages do not look like an average coloring book. I could tell my daughter was slightly confused. After an entire life of me saying to her ""We don't color in books"" it would seem that with this, I was actively encouraging it. My eight year old son enjoyed shading in some pictures and enjoyed hearing the original version of the story. I'd say this is just okay as a coloring book. Even for older kids, it is much more text heavy than it is coloring friendly."
3,Made for older toddlers,"I did not realize this coloring book would have as much written text in it as it did. I bought it for my nephew's 3rd birthday, and it was somewhat advanced for him."
2,Sounds mostly like a bunch of 60s TV Classical Gas best item,"I've always liked Classical Gas, it was the reason I bought this CD, most of the rest of the album is a disappointment. 12 selections are on this thing and ten of them sound like something from a 60's TV soundtrack, not very interesting in my opinion even if they did seem to be well handled. The only other selection I cared for was #3 Dylan Thomas, 30 seconds long starting out with some good banjo playing then finished (spoiled)by someone singing a few words.There's a note on the back of the CD about the album being recorded on analog equipment with the CD preserving that sound as closely as possible which might reveal the original limitations. I thought it all sounded very clear, Classical Gas was the only selection I'm familiar with and I heard unfamiliar detail, no static."
2,It Could Be Much Better,"I have enjoyed Classical Gas for years in two versions, both as a solo and with orchestral background and now with Manheim Steamroller I'll be able to have three excellent pieces of music.Sunflower is another piece better done with the Steamroller.Longtime Blues was well done by the Kingston Trio many years ago. The rest of the album is more or less a waste of time unless you happen to be happy with second rate stuff.Sorry, Mason but thats my feeling."
3,"Nice pictures, but nothing new here...","I'm an old-time Hollywood death hag, so the stories in the book were interesting to me. The photos are excellent and the writing is nice, but unfortunately, other than some obscure L.A. area family murders, the celebrity death stories have all been done, and in an address format too. And ""Hollywood Death Scenes"" is a little too close to ""Hollywood Death and Scandal Sites,"" which came out a year before this one. Surprising that the earlier book wasn't credited in the bibliography here."
1,expensive,why should one pay over four dollars for the chip from you when they are less than 50 cents everywhere else?Jim
5,Got item ok,Got item ok I make starships and jewelry and my wife makes quiltsWe work for the family jewelsThe flashing lights I call my starship motor and sells for about 20 bucksWhen the lights flash toward the center from each side make a patternReplaced with the proper set of magnets they should produce motion in space
3,fast shipment - happy camper,"good price, seems to be good quality, intend to use it to extend my satellite connection to my porch on a temporary basis, have not had a chance to try it out yet. GE products are usually good quality and if there is a problem they usually respond to warranty claims as does Amazon."
3,Under fill in the blank skies,"Not bad for a live album, the audience was nice enough to not whistle, etc. while she was singing, but acoustics are only average. Great to hear that her voice still sounds great. The title track song is forgettable, written just for the concert but doesn't really saying thing about Brazil. I've been to Rio and think that would provide plenty of material for a song. Just substitiute Brazil in the lyric with your favorite country next to the sea with mountains. Otherwise nice selection of music from her various recording efforts."
5,The Greatest Gift,"I have been a huge fan of this Diva since her Renaissance days. Sadly, I lost track of Annie over the years but continued to fill my collection with Renaissance gems that have appeared on CD. (King Biscuit Live at Albert Hall, etc.) Brazilian Skies is a beautiful live effort by an angel of a singer who sounds just as good as ever if not better. The choice of material is excellent and allows the listener to be introduced to new songs while remembering those beautiful ballads from the past. But more than anything it is her Voice that sends emotion done from your soul throughout your body. I can not give this CD any higher marks. She is a gift from God to those that her sing."
4,Inexpensive Intro to a Great Band,"Fans of Roxy Music, Sparks, Mott the Hoople and Roy Wood take note. I usually don't approve of 'hits' compilations, but in this case it's justified. The original albums are only available in the u.s. as pricey imports."
2,Anvil - 'Hard & Heavy' (Unidisc),"Originally released in 1981,this was the Canadian metal band's first album.Not that impressive,I'm afraid.I've heard other CD's of theirs and I know they can do better.It's been noted they're like Canada's reply to Motorhead.I don't THINK so!Whenever I listen to this disc,I need to remember there are only five of the ten tracks here that I even want to the take the time to listen to,which are ""School Love"",""Bedroom Game"",their so-so cover of the Stone's ""Paint It Black""(too many bands cover this tune,anyway),""Oh,Jane"" and ""Hot Child"".Might possibly appeal to some fans of Exodus,early Slayer,Testament and Heathen."
5,My Camera Guide,"This book goes beyond the instruction book that comes with the camera. This book explains all the whys and wherefors of each control button and features. It is well written and easy to understand, even by this amateur. Where ever the camera goes the the book goes with it. I am now getting much more satisfaction from my EOS 1Ds Mark II."
1,DISSAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT,"I read the previous ML books on the Digital Rebel that was reasonalbly infomative...THIS ONE IS NOT. If you have ever used an SLR camera before you will find yourself promptly throwing this book away. I have tried several times to look up functions in the ML book only to find myself looking it up in the owners manual.This book makes the owners manual look like a work of art...and if you have a 1DM2 you know the owners manual is anything but.Bottomline: Do not waste your money. Unfortunately, the best souce of info on the details of this camera can be found on the internet at http://photoworkshop.com/canon/. I really wish there was a good manual out there that explained the functions of the 1DM2 camera and when/where they are most useful (especially the custom functions but it just doesn't exist yet and this book doesn't even come close."
4,Chava Alberstein's Yiddish Song Collection,"This is a WONDERFUL CD. The only reason I have given it 4 rather than a 5 star rating is that her later recording of most of the same songs is more mature, with more feeling. However, there are songs on this CD that there on not on the later one.I read and understand Yiddish fluently, and have been trying to get friends to love Alberstein's Yiddish songs as I do; however, her recording companies have not been including lyrics, transliteration or translation, with the exception of The Well, which she did with the Klezmatics, another great CD.Don't pass this one up; get both and compare for yourself.Esther Chanah"
4,Well-prepared historical documentary,Don't be misled by the review that Amazon.com insists on attaching to this video. This is NOT the low-budget cult film described in that review; this is a fascinating 6-tape documentary from the History Channel. The politics and personalities are so well described that it almost seems contemporary.
2,Don't order it from this seller.,I order this ring size 9 the one I received was size 11! I already paid $5 for shipping it to my mailbox in the states then it was shipped to me in the Middle East for $8 so it isn't worth returning it back because ill have to pay for the shipping from the Middle East to the seller.
1,Disappointed,This is a great movie but product is falsely marketed by Amazon. Product is described as supplying both widescreen as well as fullscreen. Both sides are just fullscreen.
2,Always an ingredient thats not right,"I'm an accomplished ""home"" cook. First I made ""St Johns' Eve Pasta"" which had easily a half cup more breadcrumbs that needed in the recipe.It made the recipe. ""Way too Dry""Secondly, we spent an hour making Malloreddus with Fennel Seeds and Tomatoes with the saffron semolina pasta. The pasta is terrific, but once again 1 TB of red pepper flakes made me choke.DIANE FRIEDMAN"
2,Skip it,"I've tried 4 recipies out of this book and each one was either a total flop (christmas honey fritters, which were basically honey-coated balls of cracker) or expensive to cook and mediocre at best (braised short ribs in barolo). I'm not a noob cook but i'm 0-4 with this one and am about to bookmooch it in favor of the new Splendid Table cookbook. more work but i'm 4-4 out of that one!"
4,Excellent,"These shoes are great. Everyone at work complimented me on them. Not hard when they've all taken to wearing flip-flops, but they look great for sure. My only slight against them is when you first start wearing them the sole of the shoe is VERY slippery. I had trouble pushing back from my desk for the first few days until they got roughed up a little."
5,Excelent introduction to group theory,The book is very detailed and very well done. What fascinates me is its readability and the profoundness of the ideas it presents. It is well suited for those looking for the right balance between history and science. Mario Livio does a great job as a science promoter.
1,Where's the real math?,"The problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well. The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation. Why could the equation not be solved? There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book. Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general. The reason is the subject of Galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one."
1,came a month after ordering,"Ibought this for my bf,he liked the book,but it came a month late.If it was'nt for that it would get four stars"
4,Good starter set,"I purchased this set to go some special mugs for St. Patrics Day this year, they work better than I expected for the price. Selection of bit styles is nice, and comes with a good variety. The case they come in is nice and compact but easy to use, wish more sets came packed like this. Arrived on time and in great condition. I was able to use the set right away. Really enjoy this set.Update -Sept. 8th, 2012: So I have been using these for about 6 months now, have managed to develop my skills with carving glass mugs and glasses. All the bits work just fine still, and I have only purchased more sets to try different styles. Still happy with this purchase."
2,"Good price, really small though","It is as described, inexpensive and fits most small rotary tools. I bought these to help with some glass cutting that I was doing, but in the end they were just too small for that project. They would be good for hand etching or other decorative works."
1,Diamond abrasive wears off in < 30 sec,I used these bits at less than 2500 rpm in water on soft quartz. They no longer had abrasive material left on them within 30 seconds.You get what you pay for!
1,Accuracy could be better,"When using a tape measure, you want the best possible accuracy. With this electronic tape, you don't always have it. If you pull the tape out too fast, the reading will be off. You must pull the tape out very slowly for the electronic reading to be accurate. I would not recommend buying this tape until the accuracy issue can be solved."
5,Corelle Divided Dish,I have been a user of Corelle for 50 years and was just delighted to to find divided plates to eat my lunch. I often times eat at my desk and this way while I am pushing my plate around the foods do not mix. I have told many others about them.
2,Is this scary or what?,"When the leader of the free world speaks as if English was his second language? Yeah, I would call that scary."
5,"No matter what others say, especially this guy earlier","It is still a stompin' album. If you're a reef fan, then yes you'd notice it sounds a weee bit different to the earlier stuff, but so what? This guy above obviously doesn't have a clue. If you like rock 'n roll, the album is a must for ya. It blends all sorts of rock and the album varies in the tones of songs, as they have managed earlier, which makes it unrepetetive and never dull. Buy it!"
4,Very Accurate Easy to Use,"Very Accurate and fairly easy to use.Tiny print hard to see, and very thin metal.But over all Very nice product."
3,Some Modification Required,"I use the pelican cooler along with the Nyko ""cooler of death"" The pelican wouldnt fit with the nyko cooler intstalled so i had to get my dremel out and cut off the lip in the back and smooth it out so I could use them both. My one complaint like many other is when you lay the xbox on its side the cooler tends to come off. Right now I have mine situated so the xbox is laying flat and the cooler is hanging over the edge of my entertainment center. Another complaint is the LED is annoying. Its so bright that it can light a room and if playing in the dark its distracting. I'll eventually disconnect it."
4,Good cooling system for Xbox 360 but bad power LED,"Cools the unit good, but after a week of use the LED power indicator light behind the switch died."
5,"never to forget ""six million paper clips""",Very proud of these school children and what they accomplished. A must view book.
5,Inspiring!,This book shows what a group of people can do when they work together! This inspiring story comes to us from rural Tennessee and I'm so thankful for teachers who go above and beyond the call of their profession to lead our children into understanding and campassion. When possible I want to visit the memorial that they have built! Thank you to all who were a part of this project! I highly recommend this book!
4,Good pick - from a beginner's viewpoint,"These really feel good, grippy so they don't rotate. Bright color makes theme easy to spot. Cheap enough to be disposable."
3,misleading photo,"bought these for my daughter, so I can't really say if the picks are great or not, but the photo shows 5 colors of picks and we got a pack of 12 green... not quite what I was after"
1,People Magazine Bio,"An extremely shallow book that offers no insight how Greenspan thinks or makes his decisions. The reason Greenspan is such an interesting character is how he has managed to constantly adapt to changing market conditions. The real story would be why and how he came to the decisions he did, but this book just reports his actions. There is almost no economic anlysis or justification. Anyone looking to gain some understanding of Greenspan's thought process will be left wanting and extremely disappointed with this book."
3,Which song is which?,"Now this is where Bloodsimple's sound was born. I decided to get this album from Vision of Disorder because it seemed to be the only one where the lead singer isn't just screaming all the time, and it appeared to have a similar sound to Bloodsimple. Upon listening to From Bliss To Devastation, I found these assumptions to be true. However, this album has one big downfall, and that is that it's EXTREMELY REPETITIVE! I could listen to any song from this and go ""I guess that was pretty good."" And then I'd go on to the next song and go ""Huh, what's the difference here?"" On to the one after that and go ""Huh, what's the difference here?"" On to the song after that and go...well, you get the picture. Despite that the whole album, in general, sounds pretty good, I decided to take only four songs from it. It doesn't matter how great a song is, if I keep listening to different variations of the same song over and over, I'm going to get bored of it."
3,enjoyable read,"I enjoyed most of this book, though at times I am a bit confused and lost on his discussion of energy of love..etc. The alchemist is definitely easier to follow.I have read two of his other books - the Alchemist, which i think is over rated, and 11 Minutes. I agree with the last two reviewers that he is in some way ""proud"" of himself. I felt at times in the Zahir that he is talking about himself - a successful writer who writes about love, life...etc."
4,Unable to put the book down,"Paulo Coelho writing never makes you disappointed. I haven't completed this book yet (so I rated 4 stars), but the story is much better than his last book 11 minutes.He's an excellent writer, what a shame that not much people in Hong Kong knows his name."
3,"Look great, but break down quickly","After only a few months of very light use, the soles have begun to separate at the heel from the rest of the shoe. It's not bad, but you feel absolutely any moisture at all immediately."
2,Too Predictable,"I adore writer Johansen, but this time she's off the mark. A macho guy for hire teams up with an equally macho, but beautiful, jungle fighter to rescue her adorable son and an ex-priest from an evil Columbian drug lord. It's all very predictable action, and I found myself skipping over pages at the end just to get through it. Save this for paperback and a long airplane ride."
1,Walk Away!,"I enjoy reading Ms. Johansen but No One to Trust left me wanting...a. To toss it out... fast!B. To SCREAM!!!C. To say,""What the... hay!""D. To make sure Iris did in fact write this book???E. To use it as tissue to wipe the tears of hysteria from forcing myself to read just one more page.F. To lQQk for the VISINE.G.To run naked through the countryside to detoxify my system.No One to Trust lacked significance. For me, there was no nitty-gritty.Elena Kyler did nothing to make me care about her life or her situation. Bor~ing!I continued reading hoping it would get better. It didn't.I just wasted good reading time on babble. I found myself wanting to do other things instead of reading Ms. Johansen's novel. I thought it was more fun to pour honey on myself & sit under a bee's nest.Reading is all about perception, so many may enjoy this bunk book, but I enjoyed my time w/ the bees. Buzz~Buzz!"
2,What a disappointment!,"This book was boring, predictable, ...like a dimestore romance, it was worth about 10 cents! The worst I've read by her and I'm a fan. I'm glad I didn't buy this book, but read it from the Library. Even there ...my tax dollars were wasted!"
2,Not well written,"I was very excited to read this book, being a longtime Red Sox fan.But I finished the book being disappointed. Bryant's writing isn't very good, in my opinion. There are many times when he repeats the same thing he had just written, sometimes on the very next page. It reads like he wrote the chapters in non-sequential fashion, and forgot he had written the same thing earlier.One thing that irritated me especially was the continued repetition of a person's first and last name. He'll say, ""Jim Rice"" in one paragraph, and ""Jim Rice"" two or three paragraphs later. ""Rice"" would have been sufficient!There are a couple of decent chapters, especially the one about Jackie Robinson. But overall I found this book not very insightful.He makes too many assertions without any empirical research behind it. A more thorough history of the city of Boston and its racial divides would have made the reader understand more why it has treated its black athletes differently."
4,"The Sox were cursed, but not by Babe Ruth.","This book is a marvel of reporting. A tightly written exposure of eth Yawkey traditions and how the cronyism of the Sox ownership was teh real ""curse"" of the Sox. Sheds a whole new light on many Sox ball players such as Teddy, Joe Cronin, Pumpsie Green, Reggie Smith, Jim Rice, Yaz, Fisk, Ellis Burks, and Mo Vaughn. Bryant does a great job of weaving teh Red Sox pight witrh that of the Boston news media (Globe was a rag apparently not all too long ago) and teh city itself. As a new resident to the Boston area, I can still see the deep racial segregation that Bryant speaks of today. The odd thing as that the ""economics of winning"", meaning you pay for teh top player regardless of race, may be the end of racism in baseball. Capitalism trumps racism. Whooda thunk?"
1,Fatal flaw,The magnetic clasp affects the keyboard causing the phone to redial the last number when you shut the case.
4,Good case but front flap a little short so it doesnt easily snap,Have had 2 of these cases.Both of them eventually broke the seat for the on the case when I got on my car door reaching into the back seat. The belt blips stretch so they dont stay on the belt as they should and I have 2 out of the 5 I have had allow the plastic that clicks onto the phone turn on its spring so it doesn't keep the tension to allow it to firmly click onto the back of the case - gets knocked off your belt. Also the flap that covers the phone has a magnetic snap that doesn't quit align with the hole (flap an cover slightly to short - so flap pops open periodically.I have gotten used to this - put up with it although sometimes annoying.
2,Not so heavy duty,Wilson thinks that because the D Rings are designed to accomodate heavy use that this makes the binder heavy duty. Fail. The D rings are sweet but the jacket is that same as any other standard 3 ring binder. In less than two weeks of heavy use (a communication log for 25 staff) the jacket plastic began to fail which required duct tape augmentation. Only if Wilson can match the jacket to the D rings then this would be a sweet 3 ring.
1,A waste of money,"I used this sponge 8 days and it totally fell apart into shreds. I was replacing a sponge I had purchased in Greece 4 years ago, used everyday, and only replaced it because it wearing out from the usage and cleaning. This was a waste of money. DON'T BUY!"
2,The New Age Ouija Board,"Unfortunately, and despite the author's acknowledged heroic and tireless efforts on behalf of world peace, the 'Bible Code II: The Countdown' may in fact hasten the results the author seeks to prevent if those in power actually use the book as some sort of new age ouija board. For instance, why nothing on the start of WWIV on the 20th of March 2003, an event that will surely hasten The End of Days. Or even the Columbia Shuttle tragedy on the 1st of February 2003, an ominous harbinger for some?"
1,Countdown to disappointment,"This book is almost entirely written to provide ""examples"" of how the 'Bible code' predicted events that have occurred. Each of those predictions has a graphic 'showing' how it is portrayed in the Bible. The graphs are all in ancient Hebrew and nothing is really explained. This appears to me to be a case of a false prophet... the author is proud that he isn't religious and doesn't believe in God, but he does beleive that somehow ""in code"" the Bible warns us of what is to come. If you want to know what is to come, trying reading the Bible and having faith in the one true God! If you still want to waste your money on this book, I'll sell my copy CHEAP!"
2,I should have seen it coming it was in the code....,"The Bible Code II is the reason I will probably never buy the Bible Code III. If only we had known what the bible code was telling us we could have prevented [fill in Blank] including 9/11. Seriously, Apocalypse in the Bible. There is a whole book of the Bible dedicated to the end of the world, and several prophets scattering info on it throughout the Old Testament. The Bible discusses the rise and fall of Kings, the conquests of lands, destruction of Temples, Murders, Plagues and all sorts of bad happenings. There is a good chance if you play word jumble with it, you can find some matching subject matter to destruction of the world.I was disappointed in this book, I don't know what I was expecting, but this was a rant instead of a book. It felt more like a scifi novel... if we can only decode the last piece we could save the world..."
1,Sigh... This again??,"You've gotta be kidding me. After anyone and everyone with but one skeptical bone in their body debunked Drosnin's last offering, he has the nerve (or lust for money) to send this second pile of dreck our way. Ridiculous.Look, people - pick up any lengthy text and start scanning the letters at regular intervals and, lo and behold, you'll find 'prophetic' messages encrypted within.- ..."
2,Difficult to release the clamp.,"I am a big fan of Bessey clamps. However, I am disappointed in this clamp because the release button is very difficult to engage. For about the same money, I am much more satisfied with Sears Craftsman Bar Clamps/Spreaders. The Craftsman Clamp clamps harder and releases more easily."
1,Should not be labelled Bessy,"Have a wide range of Bessy clamps which, with this exception, are excellent. This, after very little light usage no longer clamps firmly: the problem seems to be in the disengage or reversing mechanisms. It is going to the scrap heap. Have standardized on Irwin for single hand clamps."
1,poor clamp,"I love Bessy clamps, but am disappointed in the DuoKlamps. I had to return 2 300x65 clamps because they slip when putting clamping pressure on them. I now have a problem with a 300x85 clamp that slips and doesn't clamp any longer. My other Dupklamps have problems in that the reversing switch sometimes disengages and needs to be reset.I think Bessy has a design or manufacturing problem with these clamps. Does Bessy have a recall on these clamps? If not, they should.Marty"
4,"Not Belle and Sebastian, but still good.","I'll admit it. I got this expecting an 80's version of Belle and Sebastian. That, is not what I got, but I don't regret buying it. It's defiantly got an 80's sound. To me it sounds like a mix between the Smiths and the Cure, with a dash of the Fall. Not a bad combanation. But Belle and Sebastian fans beware, there's not a bit of twee in Felt. Just because they're Stuat Murdoch's favorite band doesn't me they'll be your favorite. But I must admit that they're growing on me, there are some brilliant songs on here like 'Penolope Tree' and 'Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow'."
3,Ok but.....,I didn't purchase this one from Amazon though I did download it directly from the games web site. Even getting it that way I got the proper installation key but with a limit of five installations. The game itself is very interesting especially if you play through the Quest part of the game. It does have plenty of replay-ability. If it didn't matter how many times you could reinstall it then it would have a higher rating from me. For now it's just an entertaining way to pass some time.
2,Interesting but dated,"Not very helpful in making plans, because it is very out of date. But it had some interesting history and geographical information. Can't remember if the publish date was given, but that is certainly something I will look for in future purchases."
5,Wonderful Victorian era story ..,"A small book, but very well done with an interesting and believable character, and a great surprise ending. Gilman makes you believe that this woman really lived - and that you'd like to know her."
4,Only one complaint about this fantastic novel.,"Melissa Good's new version of ""Hurricane Watch"" is wonderful except for one item: this version did not contain Dar's birthday party and Jack arriving with Chino. Did I miss something? These events were in the first edition of the book. Other than that, this new version was even better than version one. Great job of revising a book and making it even better (Stephen King also did this with his book, ""The Stand"").Four and one half stars.Kudos, Ms. Good"
5,Don't see Pelican live....,"Because they are so amazing, I just saw them in Denver, they will just detract from how profoundly powerful this album is. This album is one of my top five from last year. You have to buy and listen to it very loud and preferrably with headphones. They are intricate and clever and if ""Autumn into Summer"" doesn't drive you crazy, in a good way, you're wrong and you don't deserve them. They remind me of so many other great bands that are avoiding lyrics and concentrating on their instrumentation. Only they are much heavier. If you like Mogwai, before they got mediocre; if you like Constellation Records' bands without any electronics and much fiercer; you will love this band. Oh, and if you do see them, don't say I didn't warn you."
3,For those that are not fanatics,"If you can get passed the Alan Douglas conundrum and listen to these tracks as simply pieces of music in which Hendrix participated, I don't think that most people who really appreciate Hendrix would hate this album.Granted, studio musicians were brought in to complete this album, but the spirit is still there. The first and second tracks, to me, are enough make this album worth a listen.Trash Man, an instrumental, is both explosive and intricate with moments of triumph and spaciness. Trash Man segues into Midnight Lightening which is bluesy and somewhat similar in stucture to Machine Gun.The rest of the songs are a little more common and somewhat forgettable."
4,my only complaint,"My only complaint is that Amazon's description says ""Made in USA."" However, the bottom of the bowl says ""Made in China."""
4,A Fine Weather Station,"This weather station is a very good one to own, aside from the cost, it is generally low maintenence, and is a wonderfully fun thing to own."
3,"A good start for Emmylou, but not her best.","I purchased this CD based on the reviews on Amazon but I am somewhat disappointed. Tracks 1 and 3 are some of the best country/rock ever recorded but some of the slower songs drag, even those that were hits. The GP songs are done well but GPs versions are still far superior."
5,Her best recording bar none,"I've been a fan for 30 years and this was it as far as I'm concerned. Start to finish this plays like a great roadhouse jukebox pumped full of quarters in the mid-70's. She was never so twangy or more tender. The Hot Band was never hotter. Combine this with Bob Dylan's ""Desire"" where she sings harmony on five tracks and Linda Ronstadt's ""Heart Like A Wheel"" with a great duet on ""I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You"" and you have what I consider classic Emmylou."
4,No sticking jerky,"Easy clean up. I don't know why you won't accept just a few words., I read short revieww's first. One does not have to rave about a product to lket people he is happy with it."
5,PREVIN AND THE PITTSBURGH,"This is fine example of the good things that went on with Previn when he was Musical Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The orchestra which has been one of the ""Big Six"" for many years, sounds wonderful. The sound on the disc is very good. The Water Music features the French Horn section and they were never better than on this album."
3,Herzl's Zionism in Brief,"A document of historical interest and significance, Herzl's Jewish State argues that Jews will never be fully accepted as a minority in any country, and that therefore they must form a separate state. He proceeds to outline in bold, imaginative terms, just how that might be possible. His assumptions are that there will be a great deal more cooperation and solidarity with the Jewish State than was actually the case. Though he calls on religious themes of the ""Promised Land"", he assures that there will be a secular state. If you are interested in the genesis of Zionism, then you must read this at some point. This particular copy was laden with sloppy typos, and had just the bare bones text; no introduction or context is provided. You may wish to find a better publisher, though this text itself is workable at least."
2,"Quite flimsy, but sorta works","Well, it's inexpensive, but is verrrry flimsy, uses thin materials and may not hang on too well with with thick sun visors, or if you have much more than a single document to include inside. The concept of having an item to do this job is good tho!"
4,Almost perfect,Product performance only as good as availability of FM stations with sufficiently weak signals. You might have to move from one station to another for optimum results.My next automobile will have 'plug-in' for my ipod!
1,Waste of Money,"This product is worthless. I have to constantly try to find a station that works without static, that's not something I want to be doing while driving (SF Bay area). Do not buy this unless you know someone with the same model that works in your area."
2,doesn't fit all IPod nanos,I purchased this for a new IPod nano and it did not fit. I had to break off part of the case the nano fits into to make it fit. I would caution you not to buy this if your nano is the newest version.
1,Think Before You Buy,"If you can't abide an ever-present low hiss in the background, and louder interference in the presence of power lines, don't buy this product. I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before I bought. A number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance.The manufacturer replaced the first unit after I complained, but it was no improvement. This may be the best product of its type out there, but it still comes up short."
5,Works great.,"This is the best fm tuner i've had yet. Yes its not perfect but no FM tuner will ever be. The only way to get perfect reception is to plug your iPod directly into your radio. I've read other reviews that say it falls apart instantly and it sucks blah blah blah but if you are careful you WON'T have that problem. It is a really tight fit into my cigarette lighter but I take care when inserting and taking out the tuner and I've never had a problem. Laso, even though it doesnt say that it is compatible with a 4th Gen nano it has a insert for it but it doesnt charge it."
3,Belkin TuneBase FM for Ipods,"This item works well when you aren't in the city, but it gets bad reception when you have to fight for a frequency to transmit on. It gets static and sometimes loses the station. It has a strong adjustable Ipod holder, so you can try to get a better angle on it. (Which sometimes works). I also found that when it gets static, if you keep a finger on it, the static goes away, like being grounded."
