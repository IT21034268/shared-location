3,underwhelming,"I had previously tried just plain l-Tyrosine, taking 500mg two to three times per day to treat ADHD. I wasn't sure it was working, but I noticed that I had an easier time without meds. I then switched to this acetylated version, thinking that I could do with less. I haven't noticed it being as effectively, which is strange because it's supposed to be more bioavailable. The instructions say to only take this product once per day, but that's done nothing for me. I am going to go back to vanilla l-Tyrosine supplements."
1,Penobscot Point of View,"As a member of the Penobscot Tribe who has lived on Indian Island for 37 years, and a teacher as well, I would recomend this book only if you are teaching sterotypes and non-native perception. One must keep in mind that this book is ""Fiction"". Unfortunatly, it's perceived and seems to be taught as ""Non-fiction"" - too bad."
4,Current and worthwhile.,This book had the sort of writing I was looking for. I teach art appreciation and needed to read up on this theme so I could present some ideas for the students to write and research about.
4,Joan and David,"Do you remember the day when Joan & David used to mean superb quality and the prices to match√â Well, those days have gone. These boots are comfy and well-priced but certainly not the excellent quality from days of yore... Good for mucking about in the snow and slushy city streets but not for most fashionable of excursions."
5,Just great!,"exactly the time of delivery and the product I was waiting for, the colour exactly the one I want, came here undamaged, I recommend to get it this way"
2,Not as described. :(,"These arrived quickly; however I was disappointed when I opened the package. The photo clearly shows that the cleaners have nice, rounded eyelets at each end. (Which I had planned on using to ""tag"" each cleaner with a name, so we don't get them mixed up.) The ones I received had flattened ends and not all the same size/shape. It was a bit of a disappointment..."
4,tongue cleaner set,good product.. make it easy to get that nasty stuff off of the tongue....people should really try this tool...ones mouth is much fresher using the tongue cleaner
3,OK for the super low price,Hand em out to friends and clients. Everyone loves the cleaners when they try em out. OK for the super low price.
2,Average,"There's a reason pop music doesn't cross the Atlantic to the United States anymore. One, we learned our lesson from the Spice Girls. Two, it is sappy and overly packaged. These probably aren't even real people. It sounds incredibly generic and simple minded. The lyrics aren't great either. The album is a bunch of love songs for 12 year-olds. Anyways, I don't recommend this album. Ethically speaking, don't support this. They'll stop putting out this trash if we don't buy it."
4,"Real love, unbreakable...","DO YOU BELIEVE IN real love? If you do, you need to hear West Life's Unbreakable album.For the past years, Wets Life becomes the great dad in the music world after their platinum albums.And the WestLife boys return with Unbreakable feelings.You will not be disapointed!1.Swear It Again (Radio Edit)2.

1,"""supergroup"" (snigger)","Pop music nowadays is really known for being simple minded, but this band take that to a whole new level. A supposed ""supergroup"", because 11 of their singles got to number one, DONT be fooled, they only got there because of young kids who know no better. obviously i didnt waste my hard earned cash on this [stuff], unfortunately one of my friends did. After listening to some of it, i soon realised that track 1, sounds exactly like track 5, which sounds just like track 12, which has the same vibe to it as track 7 etc etc. Westlife are just another boy band, nothing special, just following in the footsteps of nonces like boyzone etc. If you are from the usa, consider yopurself lucky that you don't have to put up with this ""band"" as they for some unknown reason, failed to break america, wonder why......? If you want to listen to some real music try early metallica or the foo fighters, or anything really but this."
5,LOVE THEM,I LOVE THEIR MUSIC! IT'S VERY REFRESHING TO HEAR A NEW SOUND THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER BOY BANDS HERE IN THE US. WESTLIFE HAS BY FAR BEEN TOGETHER LONGER THAN MOST GROUPS AND DID I MENTION THAT THEY SOUND AWSOME!!!!YOU WILL LOVE THEM AND THIS CD
5,One of the best books on Health!,"This book was translated into German and published in 1986. I read it several times over the past 25 years and thanks to this book I gave up drinking soda in my early thirties and at the same time stopped eating pommes frites aka French fries realizing that if one small pommes frites has 20 calories, the amount that people usually have, easily adds up to 400 calories or more. Insane!The photos are stunning and the health advice is so much better than in many of the new books on health which are rather confusing. This one is very understandable and at the same time a great read.Now I will enjoy reading ""Prime Time"" and then Jane Fonda's autobiography ""My Life So Far"".I hope she will write more books.A keeper and definitely 10 stars!!!"
2,Very Disappointing,I have been looking for a history and filmography of Hammer Studios films for awhile now. This book turned out to be very disappointing. Half the movie stills didn't have captions and the plot summaries had glaring errors.
1,Item received is different than pictured and not as good,"This puzzle is adorable and my son (at least from age 18 months - 2yrs) absolutely loves it - the one pictured that is, with the monkey, squirrel, and ""Nemo"" among others. He loves it so much I ordered one for a gift. Problem is the item is wrong, it's an Infantino puzzle that says ""Heads or Tails"" and has strange cartoon animals. Very disappointing. I contacted Amazon customer service and they apologized and sent a replacement which just arrived - again it's wrong. Be careful if you order sometime around the date of this review, you might get the same, lame version of this puzzle. -- Otherwise, the pieces are strong, it's well made for what it is, and my toddler loves it."
2,Loose Firewire Port Connectors,This drive worked great until the FW400 ports came loose. I took it apart as it was past the 1 year warranty and there is little to almost NO solder holding the port to the circuit board. Buy something that will last longer.
2,Loud.,"I purchased this hard drive because of its space-saving design, tasteful casing, and storage capacity. Unfortunately, however, after I got it out of the box, attached, and working (which, as it's Apple-friendly, was as easy and simple as all the other reviews say it is) its operating noise was so piercing and annoying I eventually unplugged it, packed it back up and ate my $17.49 restocking fee. Not that everyone might be bothered by such a minor technical issue as this, but paired with a virtually silent 20"" iMac, the run noise of this hard drive made me feel like I was using a 7500 all over again."
3,"Great drive, but early crash","This is a very good drive for the money, if only it would last a bit longer. While it was working (it crashed after just five months of very light usage), it copied files very fast, gave great access to video and was always available without a glitch. Even though any hard drive can crash at any point in time, I expect better from LaCie. They are currently working on getting a replacement, but of course I lost all the backup data, something I had the drive for in the first place."
4,Great little treat !,"great little treat for any occasion, really like this bag of tootsie rolls.although I thought bag was going to be bigger. but it was still a good buy (;"
2,This Osprey doesn't hold the measure!,"This Osprey doesen't have the quality as former Osprey books i have read.The author don't have the right sources to write a book upon the subject.Theres are lots of remarkable errors in the book.For example no companion cavalryman in the platesfights with armour on, and no pictures showing infantry with sarrisas(5m long spears) the weapon the Macedonians whas become famous with.The worst errors in the plates are soldiers hunting nude.Personally i like Angus McBride but this is not one of his better illustations.And for the writer, Nick Sekunda, his writng is terrible.I am very disappointed about this book.I had such high expections on this book becuse it is a so important subject.Alexander was that important subject, and im sad to now that we now so little about him, and espcially his fighting forces.Gustav Fils"
5,Creating Characters with Personality,"this is a great book, quite a few of my animation teachers said that it would be a great choice to put into my collection. and it is fill with some great stuff. thanks"
2,Not What I Hoped For,"I have read several books on how to draw characters. With this books title including the word ""personality"" I was expecting more in the details of of character development and less focus on the drawing style. Maybe this was a fault of my own perception but ultimately this book did not inspire me the way I anticipated it might."
5,Very helpful...,"This is a great resource for school administrators and families. It's definitely the type of book you want to keep handy to use as a guide for children with ADHD. It's very practical, useful, and easy to understand."
1,This is not what it claims to be.,"This is not Season One, Part One. It is The Best of Laredo, Season One. If you want to have the entire season, you have to order the 3 DVD set, entitled ""Laredo, Season One, Part One."" Unfortuneately the title of the 3 DVD set contains ""Best of..."", which isn't correct either. However the production is excellent. You just have to be sure you're ordering the right product."
5,Good overview and useful case studies of CRM,This book outlines key areas of focus for successfully implementing a Customer Relationship Management strategy. Examples help explain successful strategies used by specific companies to develop greater intimacy and loyalty with their best customers. This is key to adapting to changing customer expectations and new communication channels like the web and email. This book will help businesses prepare for the future with the Internet intertwined in the nexus of relationships between businesses and their customers.
5,Easy care luxury,"I first used this throw in a luxury spa and loved it incredibly. Looks and feels just like cashmere, but so easy to care for (machine washable and dryable). It was a wonderful gift for someone who was recuperating from surgery."
2,Now Using Duct Tape to Hold Stereo In...,"i bought this product thinking it would be great, being the only mount i could find for a 2001 taurus. It was horrible, parts broke during installation and the mount falls out when i drive fast from a stop... Would recommend some other mounts even if it cost more. this isnt worth the headaches of almost crashing trying to catch your falling radio... thanks for a crap product monopoly...."
3,Great idea,"This was a great idea. I am running a salon out of my home and needed a better way for clients to wash their hair rather then sticking their head in my bath tub. If you have a SHORT sink with a sprayer, this is great. if you have a normal hight kitchen sink clients will complain and not like it. ( uncomfortable...) I have seen this same product with a spray nozzle and am curious to how it works..."
1,Product not as it appears,"The software is intended to run on Win95 or Win3.1 which is not clearly stated in its description. You can get it to run on WinXP but you'll have to jump through some hoops to get there. It needs Quicktime for Win95 which is included on the CD. Uninstall any existing Quicktime first. You'll need to copy the entire CD contents so it appears in your root drive. Then you have to right-click on the Quicktime installer, the setup.exe installer and possibly the Autorun.exe file and change the compatibility property settings to tell XP to run it as a Win95 application. I was able to use 1024x768 and 32bit color. When you're all done, reboot and try installing the software.I hope this is useful so that you know what you are buying. I didn't but the price was right for this older software."
2,undersized slippers,Someone in this company should review American foot sizes. When a customer requests size 12 wide he should not get size 11D.
3,Slippers ok,Slippers are ok could be more comfortable. Slippers looks nice and feel good to my feet. Add and half size more when ordering slippers.
4,Pretty Good,"These slippers aren't that bad. Their sure as heck more comfortable than walking around barefoot in the morning. The inside is pretty comfy, but they don't retain heat that well. Considering the fact that I go to a school in Michigan and it's the middle of winter, that could have something to do with the heat issue. I'm thinking that these would make better spring, summer, and fall slippers. In any case, these are pretty nice slippers and I recommend them for anyone who's looking to buy."
5,"Two years of daily use, I am coming back for another pair.","I go outside up and down the drive, inside I wear them like flops, I mean I've really mistreated them and they are just starting to look shabby after two years! I think a more frugal person could easily get another year out of them. They fit well and are comfortable and warm."
3,All right for the low price but not that good for the conten,"This book is good for introducing people into programming. It introduces them to different programming languages and the advantages and disadvantages of some of them. The book also teaches the basics of Qbasic. It doesn't teach you that much about Qbasic but hey, its only 128 pages. I wouldn't recommend it that much but if you learned qbasic a while ago and forgot about it then you might want to get it."
5,A Treasure for FitzGerald Genealogist,"I found this book in the library and I HAD to have it for my own, and I found it on Amazon! If you are trying to trace the Geraldine line, this book is great! It has charts of all of the main lines: The Earls of Desmond, Earls of Kildare, etc. Written by Brian Geraldine, it does have a certain bias toward the Celtic and Norman Irish, especially the Geraldine line. But, it is full of information and provides a bibliography. I would especially recommend this book to those genealogist just getting started on the Geraldine line. In addition, it is full of Irish history for those interested. It is told in the form of an entertaining story, so be prepared to dig out the facts. It appears to be well researched and it is a fascinating account of the ""Invasion of Ireland"" - not by the English, but by the Welsh-Normans. I highly recommend it."
4,Jazzy,"Seven Heads has a winner with this one. Asheru and Blue Black are conscious MC's, but they don't get overly preachy in their lyrics. The backing, done largely by Asheru and DJ Bolex is awesome, jazzy stuff reminiscent of a lot of the Native Tongues stuff of the nineties or some newer underground stuff, especially Five Deez' Fat Jon or Lone Catalysts' J. Rawls (not too surprising, since he actually helps out on a couple tracks). Favorite tracks: Soul, This Is Me, Dear You (with a really cool Chill Will freestyle), Truly Unique, and the title track. All in all, a solid effort throughout. Check it out if you dig jazz-centric hip hop."
4,I agree!,"This album is very reminissent of De La and the native tongue movement in the late 80's and early 90's with a new twist. Asheru and Blue Black have put together an album that incorporates hiphop, soul, and jaz with just the right proportions! Shout outs to the mid atlantic for gettin on. And its good to see that the mid atlantic is gonna be known for innovative music, rather than coookie cutter groups that are so abundant nowadays! Peace to sevenheads entertainment. Keep bringin that soulful, innovative hip hop and we can balance the industry out! This is a definite buy for any real hip hop head!"
3,a little disappointed but a pretty book,I purchased this for my Grandma for her upcoming 80th birthday; I received today and flipped through just to see what the book was about and I was a little disappointed to see that the book revolves around British culture. I didn't see anywhere in the description this was the case. Only when I go back and read some of the reviews do I see this is called out. The other point would be that the font used to provide descriptions is very hard to read. I can imagine my grandma will have difficulty reading.Overall the book is beautiful but I wish I would have know it was more on British culture.
4,Great for air guns,"I've been using these on my Tanfoglio Witness 1911 blowback pistol and an air rifle and haven't experienced any problems at all. The cardboard container the cylinders arrived had split a bit inside the shipping box, but that didn't cause any damage other cosmetic. This is exactly what I expect for a CO2 cylinder."
5,A tome of information for the close up magician...,"This book is one of the classic evergreen books that every magician worth his name has a personal copy of, and has read cover to cover...The book details not only the most complex of coin magic, but also the simplest of tricks. Also covered is coin manipulations and flourishes to amaze your spectators...With this book and a little practice, you will be able to produce coins out of thin air, vanish coins into nothingness, multiply one coin into four, and much much more...Bobo's Coin Magic is the ultimate reference point for anybody who is interested in the genre of coin and pocket magic... be it for research, or for improving your performance value."
5,Get it got it good,Only the bible of coin books ever written. I have learned so much from this book I will never be able to repay the magic given to me from this book.
5,Absolutely necessary for coin magic enthusiasts,"If you're looking for a start in coin magic this is THE book! The extended version is even better, however this will give you a great start!"
5,This book is terrific!!!,Bobo's collection of sleights and tricks is excellent. There are 510 illustrations! The text is usually easy to follow and the diagrams are clear. The book is sequenced appropriatly. This is a must for those who wish to work with coins.
4,Incredible resource,"This book contains page after page of techniques and tricks. As the other reviews have pointed out, it is outstanding and sets the standard for books on coin magic. The only negatives are the quaint chapters on sleeving and cuffing, which date the book. However, I have found gem after gem while combing through the pages. The price definitely makes this essential."
2,"Cute flip-flops, but won't hold up","I got these flip-flops less than a month ago and they're already coming apart! I know, they were on the cheap side, but still...."
3,ONE OF WORST STAR WARS BOOKS EVER,"I am a Star Wars freak who likes almost anything that has to do with Star Wars but not this. Bad plot, bad characters, and low actionas were all the books in the Jedi Academy Serises. Kevin J. Anderson if you want to write Star Wars novels they better be better. And my final word NO ONE READ THIS"
2,A pretty awful read,All a bit far-fetched and unbelievable. Why would Daala wait hidden in the maw for 10 years if she had heard no news from Tarkin? You would have thought she would have become a bit curious after a year or so and sent out some scouts to find out what was going on - I mean 10 years with no contact from the outside world!!! And an indestructible ship with quantum armour plating?! Not very realistic. Some redeeming parts but few and far between.
3,Not the best Star Wars book out there but..,"Fortunately, I have yet to read any other Star Wars Book that's on the market; so I found the book pleasant enough. But background info on the events from the other SW books provided by peers gave me a seamless transition from SW movie to SW novel. One thing i had against the book after reading it is ""Jedi Search"" is too predictable plotwise. A presented dilemma in a chapter is easily solved with different solutions in that same chapter (i mean how lucky can the characters get , they even have a chance to choose from those solutions) so there isn't really enough time to build up the suspense and you just go reading on what else has to happen next.It isn't overly original either. The superweapon bit is getting old. But regardless , it does have its moments and it sets a nice base for the next two Jedi Academy books in store. Let's just hope it gets better."
2,Read The Other Two in The Trilogy First!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"With a two star rating you can tell that this book is a rip. Another Superweapon? In the other two in KJA's Trilogy There is a little action. I mean the whole story practicaly takes place in the spice mines of Kessel. What could be more boring. I you want good steady reading try ""Dark Apprentice"" or ""Champions of the force."""
4,This is AWESOME!,"When i read this book I was hooked. I read this like mad! I found out Luke went to the Darkside, and how he escaped. They acted just like they did in the movie. Those who say this is bad [stink]. My only problem is the Sun Crusher. And he based some of this on his comic book series! C'mon, something original!"
4,Great Book,"Not quite as good as the thrawn trilogy , but still pretty good. I like and recommend this book to any starwars fan"
1,"Yeah, it sucks","This is some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen in any novel. Not to mention that the plot formula is EXACTLY the same as the movies. Take a death star; only this time make it smaller and indestructable. Instead of blowing up planets, why not have it wipe out entire systems, (so much for originality) and you get the Suncrusher. And its up to none other than Han Solo to save us (once again) from the (defeated?) empire. My bottom line here is that the plot is VERY predictable and the corny dialogue is an atrocity."
4,My view,This book is one of the best books I have read. This book was non stop action from start to finish.I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy. Andrew Cox age 11
4,Cute but not one of your tougher lift the flap books...,"This is an attractive book that combines lift-the-flaps with textures. The combination is appealing to my young toddlers, but I have to say that it is not the sort of book I leave out for them to play with unsupervised. I've had others constructed like it and the flaps just don't stay attached (if you know what I mean).The story begins when an adorable baby mouse in diapers starts to seek his friends: a pink salamander behind a bowl of smooth cherries; a brown mole behind a pot filled with scratchy sand; a butterfly behind silky flowers; and a black skunk behind a watering can of shiny water. The story ends when his friends seek him and find him behind a rough basket.These are all elements that small people can relate to and I would say that if you are looking for a sweet non-Barney, non-commercial kind of gift that it would be a good choice."
5,blake's inn fantastic!,"An entirely enjoyable tale with the same attention to whimsical detail as Blake himself would have used. The illustrations by the Provensens are perfectly compatible with the material, as well as Blake's original material and illustrations. A masterpiece to be enjoyed by all ages - Bravo!"
2,Can be DANGEROUS on gas stove,"We've had this kettle over a year. We love the look of it and the fact that it heats water quickly and retains the heat a long time. However, it can be DANGEROUS on a gas stove. If you look at the design, you'll see why this happens -- if you put too much water in it, it won't whistle, it will instead boil over without warning; the water will boil out through the spout, run down the side, then under the kettle and douse the flame underneath. So the FLAME IS OUT but the GAS IS ON. This has happened several times. If you don't overfill it (above the spout), it's perfectly fine, but it's hard to keep reminding other people like guests and family. We've decided to replace it with a kettle that has a higher spout and a flat bottom."
5,Not risky,A great read! I loved Liz with her enhanced fingernails and smart mouth. The backchat with her teen-aged sister is right on target. Well paced; plot follows through nicely. Mixes search for killer with new-technology religion with dysfunctional family with realistic romance. First in a new series and I can't wait for the next one.
3,funny but not for newbies,"I enjoyed the DVD very much, as I grew up with Carol Burnett and her crew. I loved seeing them all together again, hearing the tarzan yell, watching Tim Conway shuffle. But when I sat down to watch this with my kids, we were disappointed. If you don't know the jokes, the innuendos, the history, the laughs are lost. If you know Carol and are familiar with her show, then you will love this. If not, choose something else."
2,Disappointing,"Although there are great moments of course, this is just too short to do justice to the 11 year run of the program. (42 min) Some of the clips are also missing enough setup and introduction to see where the blooper was or what was intended or to just set the mood."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed, as I expected to see complete shows instead of partial skits, and a lot of talking by the actors. I wanted to see the shows thats why I purchsed the tape. Wasted my money."
1,Carol Burnett Promotion Series,"I was so disappointed with the quality of the videos. The volume had to be constantly adjusted and there were skips in the audio that eliminated two or three words about every 15 seconds. I was embarrassed to have sent two videos as gifts. When I viewed the other 6 videos with friends for the first time it was very irritating, and not funny, to view such poor quality taping. I am shocked that Ms Burnett would promote these tapes produced by your company. Your offers will not be recommended in the future."
1,Warning - very little of the CB Show,This was quite a let-down. Minimal snippets from the original show. (Though there are a few bawdy moments that are good for a laugh.) Most of it was question/answer with the audience and some tribute song/dance routines. If you are a hard-core fan you might enjoy this walk down memory lane. I would have preferred to see more of the original show.
2,disappointed,"I LOVED the Carol Burnett show but I was disappointed in this DVD. It was not the show itself, it wasn't what I was looking for."
2,The Carol Show Stoppers Show,"This was a big disappointment. It was short, only 42 minutes long, and did not contain any of the funniest skits that I remember watching when they originally aired. In fact, there were no complete skits on the DVD at all, just a few seconds from about 10 different skits. Not worth the money."
4,Dreamweaver MX 2004 Accelerated,"I like the examples in this book very much, they are professional in nature and gradually increase in complexity. However, this book has some basic procedural errors in almost every chapter. These are not substantial errors but they make for a bit of a challenge in a classroom when your students get confused. Sometimes the wrong supporting image will be displayed and referred to by an unrelated step. Other errors include an incorrect procedure, or a missing but important procedure. Also, be aware, some copies out there are missing pages. By now this problem has probably been corrected and I hope that a new edition comes forward soon with the errors fixed. Otherwise, I agree with the other comments, this is a fantastic resource with top notch examples. When new concepts are introduced by example, a thorough and detailed description of what is being introduced preceeds the example. I still recommend this book for my classes."
3,The Ominous Reality of the Totalitarian Delusion,"This is a fascinating story about an Albanian Dictator (the Guide) and his Successor's controversial death. The story has been summarized already in numerous reviews so I'll refrain from that.What is interesting is to see how well the author has captured the omnipresence of a totalitarian regime's oppression and the lingering threat of ""relegation"" for those who fail to follow ""the Doctrine"" of the Party. It is mind control, the rationalization of illogical ideas and/or motives and the destruction of the human being. It is analogous to the fanatical or misguided wing of a religion or corporation or group of people. An illuminating book worth consideration.While I liked the book, I found it did not thoroughly engage me. Perhaps that is the result of it having been translated into English, through French from Albanian. Did the words capture the intention of the author or were they the technical language of the translator?"
2,Only One Good Song,"This disappointing CD has one good song, ""Latin Quarter"", which still receives lots of airplay. None of this CD's other songs have the infectious, up-tempo beat of ""Latin Quarter"" and some are very slow. The final track, ""Storytime"" is okay however it is puzzling why most of this CD is overly mellow."
1,Not Usable,"I purchased this product, but never could get it to close the door properly. When calling customer service I could tell that they were just reading things to try and really didn't know the product. I even tried a second unit, thinking that I had just gotten a bad one. This unit might work well on inside door units, but the outside doors it definately didn't work for me."
5,Music,"The CD was a great present for my newphew. He is mayoring in classical guitar in the university of Costa Rica and he plays the guitar in the university guitar group. They have done lots and lots of concerts around the world, so, the music of this CD was perfect present for him.He also speaks Spanish ( of course ), English and French!!!!Thank you for a great present."
3,"Great that it matches the book, but, no answer key to know if the worksheet is correct.","The title pretty much says it all. It's one page per section, for each section in the chapter. Not a lot of practice, but, does make a good study guide. The only problem, unless there is a tutor or Geometry teach handy, it's sometimes difficult to know if the answers to the problems on the worksheet are correct."
3,The band was named after the book ...,"... not the other way around. Fans of Hunter, Watts & Co. should see this as perhaps an insight into the band's early influences. It is *not* a biography of the band (which didn't even exist yet)."
2,Steel not aluminum - still,"The picture of the box shows aluminum, the description says aluminum, but they're not aluminum. They're steel.Plenty strong, just heavier than I expected. There are aluminum ones available on Amazon for practically the same price (within a few cents)."
3,Picture better than actual stand...,"I have two katanas that I wanted to display in my living room. They used to hang on the wall, but I wanted to put them on top of an entertainment center instead. I didn't want to spend more than $20. I found a few stands cheaper than this one, but they were simple click and lock types with no hardware. I wanted a little more quality and durability, and the picture on this one looks great. However, it really isn't that much better.The stand does have screws, but the construction is cheap. After putting it together, it is not level, wobbles, and the wood isn't glossy finished as shown. It feels as if a stiff breath could knock it over. Thankfully, my swords sit so high, the stand can barely be seen. However, if you are looking for one to use at eye level, or where someone can see closely, I recommend spending more and buying one from a weapon store like BudK."
2,Rickety Racks,"Not to bad for the price however, this stand had to be modified just a bit as it was cut just a bit wrong and would not stay together without a little modification."
2,Very Mediocre Romantic/Relaxing Sax!!,"This CD has only two or three tracks that I would categorize as ""relaxing"" or ""romantic."" On some tracks, the sax is really loud and irritating or has too fast of a tempo, and ruins your mood if you are already in a relaxed and romantic mood. I just can't see how this CD got 4- or 5-star reviews.If you really want to hear some romantic/relaxing sax, try the two great CDs by Ben Webster titled Quiet Now: Until Tonight and Ben Webster for Lovers, and also At Ease with Coleman Hawkins, all at a much lower price. Then decide for yourself what romantic/relaxing sax really sounds like. When I play these three CDs, friends ask me where they can get a copy, but when I played this CD by Houston Person, two friends at a weekend dinner asked me to change it because it was ruining the mood of the occasion. So it is not only my individual opinion."
5,"Gorgeous, natural color!!!!","I've been using this color for about five years now and get some of the most amazing compliments! It's a deep, rich brown with almost prismatic reddish and gold highlights. People stop me on the street to compliment me on my hair.It also provides incredible gray coverage, just be sure to use a 10 volume or 20 volume developer. I have very thick, coarse hair and leave it on for a full hour for maximum gray coverage that lasts weeks. If you have finer hair, 30-45 minutes is fine."
2,"Lazy, noisy, pencil sharpener","You would think it is doing something because it is sending out some powerful sounds but it is just noisy. I waited for almost two minutes for it to sharpen a pencil......slow. At times it would not sharpen the pencil but it sounds like it is sharpening. Looks beautiful, but needs a little more work to make it work properly. Maybe someone else will have better luck with it, I did not. I added a few more dollars and ordered a Panosonic. I will tell you about it when I receive it."
1,Great for the first 10 pencils,"This unit worked great for a day or two, but I guess the blade gets dull very quickly, then just tears the pencil apart and breaks off the lead. I agree with some of the other reviewers, that it's a cheap 'manual' little sharpener with a motor and shaft. Very poor!"
1,I can't believe they still sell these,"I bought a set more than a year ago on 'clearance', and I see they're back. I read the reviews and complaints about sturdiness, and bought them anyway since they were cheap. I sat on one chair about 5 times before it literally exploded under my weight. I'm 170 lbs. I still have the second chair and I'm afraid to let anyone use it...the design is just flawed to distribute too much weight to a small piece of hardware and cheap wood...so if you would like to tell your friends the story of how you were almost killed by a chair, this is a fine way to go about it. A more accurate product description would be 'Make your own kindling wood quickly and easily...just sit, wait, and POW! you're ready to pick the wood (and yourself) off the ground. Great fun at parties!'"
2,TRIBUTE?...DON'T TELL ZZ TOP THAT!,"I'VE BEEN REVIEWING THE BEST OF MY BLUES COLLECTION LATELY....AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE WORST. AND THIS CD IS ONE OF THEM. ""TRIBUTE..."" SOUNDS MORE LIKE A MOVIE SOUNDTRACK OR A BACKGROUND FOR A COMMERCIAL THAN A ZZ TOP TRIBUTE. OF THE NINE TRACKS, EIGHT OF THEM ARE MEDIOCRE INSTRUMENTALS. ONLY ONE IS A VOCAL. IT'S TITLED ""RED DRESS"" (AN ORIGINAL COMPOSITION). ACTUALLY, IT'S ""THE SAME THING"", BY WILLIE DIXON. SO MUCH FOR THIS BAND'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE BLUES. SO, SAVE YOUR EARS AND MONEY. YOU'LL HEAR THE SAME MUSIC ON ANY CAR COMMERCIAL....AND MAYBE YOU'LL GET TO SEE SOME NICE CARS TOO. OH, YEAH...IF YOU SEE ZZ TOP....PLEASE...DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT THIS CD. JERSEY SLIM"
4,"Good book , a little to much on powder loads , but still OK","Ok Book To much info on powder loads for me but still OK, OK OK OK OK OK OK OK"
3,Chairs,"The chairs look pretty - not the most comfortable. Since we don't sit in them for long periods of time, they work OK for us."
3,Far from definitive,"McMahon's book comes out of the Keith Baker stable of historiography with its stress on ""political culture"" rather than on sociopolitical ideas. In that vein, it achieves something useful by offering a synthetic overview of the Counter-Revolutionary culture in late l8c. France. However price of this approach is a rather superficial analysis of many of the thinkers/writers/ideologists it only mentions in passing or intermittently. It is strange, for example, that the author does little with the quite extensive scholarship devoted in recent decades to such major theorists of the Right as Maistre and Bonald. In short, this study is far from definitive and should be supplemented by reading the often deeper exegeses of these Rightists that can be found in the academic periodical literature and in the older studies of Godechot, Gengembre, and Beik, among others."
4,reviews,Choppa cool the choppa style song is off the shznle fo wizzle the beat is tight and the lyrics is cool and new to no limit records. He good so far i want to herre mo. Choppa overall is a good rap artist.
2,Disappointing,"Judith Jamison is an amazing woman and an amazing dancer. I have learned more about her through her performances than I did through this book. I found it to be very focused on outward events in her life, rather than what was going on inside. She seems to take great care to omit information about her own personal life, leaving gaps in her life story and ultimately, a disappointed reader. It's another arts-celebrity biography full of tales about premieres, events, honors, hard work, but no real window into her innermost self."
5,Awesome Book,"As someone who is planning to have a family soon, I really appreciated the advice of a parent without all the technical mumbo jumbo. I particularly appreciated the fact that it took a holistic approach to raising children and did not just focus on one particular stage of development. In addition, it was an easy reader and I recommend it to any parent or parent-to-be."
3,Poor recording.,"The music and singing would be lovely if this were not such a poorly-recorded CD. Grating at times, blurred spots, and an echo that varies, but is always annoying."
1,puppet is made in China and looks like an ugly princess...,"This is the the 5th puppet I got from the series. First we got the CHEF and the COWGIRL, then the PIRATE and I just received the KNIGHT and the PRINCESS... Although I was happy with my previous orders I am not with this one. The crown s not properly on her head and the mouth has so much material at the lower jaw making the princess to look like an ugly fat old queen... I am very disappointed ...but that's what you get when the toy is made in China.... So buyer be aware."
3,not as cute as other princess puppets,"I like it a lot, but I don't like the stick attached to the arm. I bought this for my 3 year old Granddaughter and I don't think she can master the arm. I'm sure she'll have fun with it."
3,PG-13?!,"Troma is my favorite movie studio. Sure most of there movies really suck but alot of them are entertaining and worth at least a look at. I was looking at this movie for awhile and during a Troma movie buying binge, I got this movie. Its PG-13 but does still have some decent gore. I hate bugs so that is probably why it was creepy for me. It was alright and one of the better Troma movies ive seen."
2,Mediocre,"Yawn.... okay, it was an ""okay"" movie, but not the ""highly-acclaimed"" film I was expecting. Great acting on all parts... but too long and not very credible. The only realism was the fact that an innocent black man was found guilty for a crime he did not commit. I guess it was ""okay"" for a Steven King story, but... Oh - and the academy award goes to the mouse, Mr. Jingles. :)Glad I waited til this was out on video. I would have regretted paying theater prices for a so-so film."
3,Eh...,"I found this book to be interesting in its thoroughness of the different contexts of symbols but unfortunately, poor editing and fact checking have resulted in numerous mislabeled symbols and misinterpretations. The illustrations were high-quality and sharp. I tend to use this book to trace symbols for which I already know the meanings. Also, I think the author's attempt to illustrate some abstract symbols could be confusing for the reader attempting to grasp a beginner's level knowledge of symbolism."
3,Less about Adams than the first English trading company,"This books covers well the history of the first English and Dutch attempts to trade in the far east including Japan and less about Adams himself. Samurai William Adams comes and goes thoughout the book but I never felt I got to know Adams well; this is in contrast with Cocks, the leader of the English factory in Japan, whom I came to understand very well.The author was likely handicapped from access to authentic Japanese accounts of the period."
4,Pretty Basic Information,Like all books you have to read it. This one can't be skimmed over very easily. Possibly because it is a law book. This book too was bought for college courses. Some things were confusing because I don't really follow laws or agree with them all the time. Was a good book to have and work through. The exercise questions help a lot.
4,Encaixe perfeito,"Um produto bastante interessante, encaixou perfeitamente na minha pickup (Dodge RAM 1995). O unico porem, √© que ele no fica 100% fixo (talvez por eu ter usado um modelo universal), voce prende a carga perfeitamente, mas ele sai um pouco do lugar."
3,"Workable, but not perfect","I bought four of these for my pickup. I broke one of them during the installation. I like the idea of a close to flush mount tie down. I used another brand in the back and these in the front.This is better than nothing, but not perfect by a long shot. Probably worth what you pay though."
4,"Quality product, instructions poor","We love the scale, but it was a little difficult to get set to US weights instead of Metric or British ""stones"""
2,Fangs of the Undead,"Super-model Anita Ekberg inherits a castle, breaks off her engagement, and falls under the spell of her cold and strange uncle as she learns more of her inheritance and her heritage.Or something like that. FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka Bloody Girl, Malenka the Vampire, The Niece of the Vampire and The Vampire's Niece) is hard to follow and probably not worth the trouble. I think Ekberg's grandmother Malenka (also played by Ekberg) was a dabbler in the black arts, outed and burned at the stake by irate villagers just after she'd brought Uncle Max to life, or undeath. Anyway, she's burning while he's fluttering his eyelids and wiggling his fingers. You figure it out.In any event, there's a spooky castle, a creepy vampire uncle, busty barmaids, a gallant fianc√© and trusty sidekick, and bunches of garlic hanging in every innocent window and doorway. This may well have been a satire that will appeal to fans of the genre. I just found it unpleasantly confusing."
3,Great idea with one Major Flaw,"We love the Bearatrooper and have had a lot of fun with it. The kids run around the field waiting for it to drop and we always put something in the backpack for them. Usually $1-$2.Our problem. The timer is very sensitive. If barely turned, it will still last a long time. The numbers don't seem to mean anything. Also, we've used it 3-4 times and now the timer claws won't close, no matter how long we set the timer for. It's a cheap timer gadget. Now, we've put a rubber band around one claw, put the bear hook over the rubber band, so it just balances there. Carefully let out the line and then shake the line to get it to fall.Does ANYONE know where to get a better timer device? Maybe in the Remote Control Plane world? A magnetic release? a radio-controlled realease?We LOVE the bear and want to continue the game, but we're frustrated with the lame timer."
2,Keeps shutting off - in the middle of pouring ingredients!,"This scale would be great if it didn't shut off in the middle of pouring ingredients. I have followed recommendations of other reviewers and poured more quickly, didn't pause, etc. and it just doesn't matter. The scale shuts off as flour is hitting the bowl, so if I need to measure 7 oz, I'll get to 3 oz and then it will shut off. It is VERY frustrating and the help number on the manual is now going to AT&T;, not Salter.If you use 2 bowls to measure everything & constantly start over, it works. But it makes twice the mess and is four times as frustrating. I can't recommend this product, and wish there was a solution to the shut-off problem."
3,This scale is a blessing and a curse!,"This scale is a blessing and a curse for me. I love it but like the other reviewers have noted - it's shuts off too quickly. I also have accepted the fact that the scale measures in increments of 5, so it is not exacting. The methodology behind this scale is very cool and I can work with it despite its annoying limitations. That said, for folks looking for a recommendation - I would look for an alternative scale with more positive reviews."
5,10 slices of cheese please!,"This is one of the best cheese movies ever! I don't care if anyone else craps on this movie with their reviews...it's meant to be stupid, dumb, bad, etc., etc. It is exactly what you would expect from a movie titled ""Chopper Chicks in Zombietown"""
4,Zombietown - in my favorite getaway.,"OK. So the story is a stretch. But since I've stayed many times in the town of 80 people where it was filmed it is special to me. The general store, only bar, and the front of the hotel where I stay are major scenes. Besides, a girl motorcycle gang (""Cycle Sluts""), zombies, and a school bus full of blind orphans. All in a nearly ghost town. What more do you need for an innovative story line?"
4,You've got to own this movie,"I went to a private showing of this film with Oakland's Harley Owners Group years ago at the Pizza Hut after a Berkeley theater decided to cancel the showing.This film brings new meaning to the designation ""low budget"". The ""Cycle Sluts"" are a pack of tantalizing beauties who ride hard across the desert on shiny new hogs by day and sleep around a campfire each night. However, in every scene the girls appear as though they have just stepped out of the beauty salon.When the biker women come across a small town and find that the dead are coming back to life,... Sound familiar? This flick doesn't try to hide the fact that it's ""The Wild One"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead"". The only way to kill a zombie is by burning it, and just before they burst into flames, the zombies turn to motionless manikins. The plot and the actors get dumber by the minute.You've got to own this movie. Only one thing -- just don't want to watch it sober."
4,"Good product, Questionable Customer Service","I have had this unit for over a year and when it works, it has been perfect to keep my garage above freezing.I am having a real problem with customer service. When I first installed it, I was having a problem. So I used the ""Contact Us"" web form. Never heard back. I fixed the issue my self, and then used the unit for a year. This winter, I cranked the unit back up, and had another problem. Once the pilot light was lit, the main burner would come on and stay on, no matter what the thermostat was set to. It stayed on even if I disconnected the thermostat!! Tried to contact Mr. Heater vie their web form. No response after 2 weeks. Today I waited on hold with technical service for over an hour, no response. Now the technical service line is just ringing. Has been ringing for 15 minutes straight. Decent product, but can't get any help from the company in any fashion."
1,Don't buy it,DVD player stopped working after 6 months of fairly light use. Cleaning disk didn't help.
4,Pretty good,This has served me well for the past three months no problems to speak of even hooked up to a televisoion from the 80's! works great!
3,Doesn't come with a universal remote.,"I would have expected the remote to allow me to also control my TV. Nope, remote is only good for the player.I didn't check but frankly, in this day and age I assumed it would. I've returned it and never even plugged it in so no idea how it works besides that."
1,can't get my shipment,"I was suppose to get my vcr/dvd combo by October 8 - 9, Today is the 17th, and still haven't gotton shipment. I have or ""had a customer"" waiting for this order. He's not happy!!!"
1,DO NOT GET THIS,"The VCR is dreadful when it works. I have hundreds of hours of tape that this VCR has problems playing. It always skips and you can never get the tracking down just right. There is no visial display in tracking.Also, APEX customer support is factually non-existant. Their website answeres nothing and you can't contact them via email. Also, their tech-support hotline is open 8 hours and the signal is busy during those times.You'll have to end up spending $30 to send the piece of crap back because buying electronic online is like playing Russian Roulette."
2,"It worked, but display didn't","After reading not-so-good reviews on most dvd/vcr combos on this and other external sites, I decided to try my luck with the Apex 3800. My luck was not so good with this model, as I found when I hooked it up to our tv. The front LED display did not display anything--no clock or counter display, making us believe at first that the machine was not powered at all. After figuring out that the machine was working but dysfunctionally, we put in a DVD to try it out. Every 10 minutes or so, a loud popping sound would come out out of our tv speakers. This never happened before we had the machine. This may have been just a faulty machine..but I'm returning this one and looking for other brands that are out there."
3,"""Right the First Time"" Gamma's High Watermark","Guitarist Ronnie Montrose formed Gamma after the 1976 breakup of Montrose, whose original line-up included drummer Denny Carmassi, bassist Bill Church, and, of course, singer Sammy Hagar. Hagar and Church left the band in 1975, while Carmassi continued with Montrose and Gamma until 1983, when he joined the revamped Heart. (Carmassi and Hagar reunited to write two songs for Heart's 1990 album Brigade.) The familiar voice on ""Right the First Time"" belongs to Davey Pattison, a respected vocalist who has worked with countless rock artists, most notably Robin Trower."
5,A great source of information & entertainment!,"Short blurbs, anecdotes, lessons, and stories about writing from the literary likes of Frank Conroy, Arthur Miller, Donald Westlake, David Mamet, Ann Beattie, Elmore Leonard, Margaret Atwood, Stephen Fry, Ann Patchett, Amy Tan, P.J. O'Rourke, and about 35 others.If you like reading, this book is filled with many a gem. My favorite was Donald Westlake discussing his somewhat complicated relationship Richard Stark, the pseudonym under which he wrote his ""Parker"" series of novels. Interesting, intriguing, funny, and thought-provoking.Having read this, I'll be going to my local public library and looking for Volume 1, as well as the Paris Review Interviews."
1,Not Worth The Time.,"""Muse"" is right. Muse is all they do in this book. And the musing isnt interesting or helpful. What it reminds me of is a group hug with strangers. As in...what's the point?"
1,KRZRK1 Cosmic Blue Phone (unlocked) DOA,"The product arrived in a sealed box which I was unable to get to for a couple of weeks, three to be exact post acceptance of delivery. Upon attempting to charge and power up, discovered it was dead on arrival.Now I must return and somehow get this resolved."
3,Could of been happier...,"I ordered this phone thinking it was the real deal but then to find out it's an european phone and can not receive downloads or pictures. What is the sense of having a camera phone you cannot share pictures, download ringtones or games of your choice.I suggest if you want this phone with all the features you get it directly from the manufacturer or a cell phone store. This was a gift for my husband and was emabarresed when I found out all of this by taking it to a Cingular store, yes I paid cheaper but was not given the full description of what I was getting."
1,KRAZR can't take the Micro SD Card,"The KRAZR is a disappointment. I just received this phone yesterday from Amazon.com, only to find out that it cannot take the 1GB MicroSD Card from my Motorola V360. It just keeps blinking !Removed Memory Card! when the MicroSD Card is in there. It blinks so much that it is nearly impossible to maneuver the buttons through the phone book or other menu options. My V360 accepted the MicroSD Card just fine when I checked to see if the problem was just my MicroSD Card. The KRAZR won't even recognize that there is a card when you check the Storage option in the phone settings menu. It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device. If it wasn't for the MicroSD Card issue, I would not have any problem with it. If you are intending to have this phone, wait until Motorola comes up with a fix or a recall."
2,terrible speaker phone,"The speaker phone option was really important to me, and it is virtually useless on this phone. Most people complained that they couldn't hear anything I was saying over the speaker, I'm on Verizon Wireless, and my wife's LG speakerphone is crystal clear. Definitely would not recommend."
1,Huge Misrepresentation and Fraud,"The seller indicated that the phone was a high quality phone that was compatible with AT&T GSM phones. Nothing could be further from the truth. the back of the phone will not stay on, making it useless! It is the worst purchase I have ever made through Amazon!"
5,Works well,Item works as advertised. It is a little short but that is my fault for not ordering a longer one. I would recommend this to a friend.
4,Wonderful Beginners Guide to Hamsters!,"I would have to say that this book wook be a good buy for anyone looking to find out what can be good, or bad, for their little hamster friend!It has usefull hints, tips, tricks, and must-does that will insure your time spent with your hammie is time well spent indeed.Hamsters are enjoyable pets, and this excellent book gives you insight on how to create the perfect environment for both you and your hamster to enjoy one another, as well as offer some lessons on Hamster Handling, and even the neater Hamster Potty Training!"
4,"Mr. Heater 22,000 BTU Propane Radiant Heater #F272100","i really like this unit, and it works really well.although i think the pilot flame could be smaller even when adjusted all the way down. just seems like a big waste of fuel. but still a great unit..."
2,Bench Vise,"The vise that I received worked fine until I use it to hold an axe head while I drilled out the old handle which broke. After that the vise jaws will not close completely. It seemed to be a very sturdy vise when I first got it, but, it appears, as though I've found a weakness."
2,And it was downhill from there... (possible spoiler),"I picked this book up at the library at the recommendation of my mother and sister. I started this book anticipating a lot, but once I got to the graphic scene with Daisy and Duncan (who creeped me out), it was downhill from there. I did not appreciate the very graphic imagery. I understood that the point of view was from the third person, but I wasn't sure if a certain emphasis was supposed to be on Daisy. I was just confused throughout the majority of the book. I think that the death of John could have been some great rich material, but the best this book could evolve to would be a Lifetime movie. I didn't even finish it, I was so disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first Sue Miller book I have read and not sure if I'll try any more of her other books. When one gets used to literary geniuses like Jodi Picoult and Chris Bohjalian, Sue Miller's writing style is a let down and leaves a lot of room for improvement. She does not achieve a smooth clear cut narration of each character. One moment you think she is referring to one character only to realize the next line she is already referring to another. There are parts when her style of writing almost reminded me of elementary beginner books, ex. Eva did this, Daisy did that, Eva said this, Daisy thought that...And what's with those frequent bold-faced words? I don't get it. I skipped through a lot of pages as it was getting boring and I hate not finishing a book once I've start reading it."
2,Disappointing!,Just an OK read. A major disappointment given the reviews and previous Sue Miller novels. I wouldn't bother.
3,fair,Lost in the Forest is not one of Sue Miller's better books.I agree that the ending was kind of a disappointment. You would think Daisy's Father would have been outraged by the thought of Duncan and his young daugher's affair.I didn't really see the point of this story. I felt bad for Daisy in that she was so mixed up after her stepfather died and Duncan took advantage of her.
3,Slodier of the Legion,"A good book but the writing style i found a little disjointed,the book is like a cross between Halo and Starship Troopers.The legion is made up of soldiers taken as teenagers and made immortal with armoured fighting suits to combat slavers and aliens i would definitely be buying the rest of the books in the series."
5,GREAT BOOK,"It's interesting, well written and children love it. My son could not put this book down and remembered most of the information he learned from reading it. His favorite chapter was the Archer Fish, with the lung fish being a close second. After reading this book, visit Youtube and look up each fish to make each more memorable for your child. Well worth the price!!"
2,A dreadful way to capture a ballet,"I love Wheeldon's work but this DVD is a disappointment. The video editing is dreadful, often giving us choppy cuts between medium shots and close ups, when we should be seeing the entire stage or at least the entire bodies of the dancers. It's viscerally annoying and completely spoils the flow and rhythm of the dance. Joby Talbot's score is also dreadful - filled with tinkley effects rather than memorable melodies and recurring themes. The only redeeming aspects--and they aren't redeeming enough--are the sets, stagecraft, and special effects. If you love dance, you won't love this. This critique, by the way, is meant as a review of the DVD, not the ballet, which can't be properly appreciated as presented."
4,Better shows from this era exist...,"I mean, let's make no mistake, any Sonic Youth record is better than most everything else on the racks. But when comparing this to other bootlegs from the ""Sister"" tour, you wonder why they chose this one to release. The sound is SO thin, and it really kills some of the songs. I would recommend tracking down ""Be My Sister in Death"", as it has almost all the same songs but a MUCH better sound.Let's be honest, though: you are going to buy this for the enchore where they do Ramones covers. I will grant that this is one of my favorite Sonic Youth moments, as they really put their all into these covers, having fun but still treating them with the reverance they are due. This is the Sonic Youth that everyone forgets about when they talk about them being too arty - these folks also have their feet planted firmly in punk rock and can also display a wild sense of humor."
4,"They work great, but not stainless type like picture shown","These work great on our stern hatch on our sea ray 290 sundancer. However, the picture on here shows them as being stainless. These are not the stainless ones, fyi....."
3,"Well, at least the stereo isn't in the glove box.","Installed it in a 1995 Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla. Brass tacks, the screw holes don't match up. The unit is too short by a full centimeter to use the two bottom screw holes, and the top is too narrow by about 5mm to hang properly. Lopsided and crooked, and the cup holder assembly pops apart on a whim now. And this is according to the manual's assembly instructions for that specific model of Toyotalet.It'd be much better if it came with epoxy and blank plastic panels to fix the spacing issues, but whatever."
4,Gift for son's baseball coach,"We gave this screen to my son's baseball coach for a christmas gift. We set the screen up for him when we gave it to him....he was very pleased. Only time will tell how well it holds up to a nightly beating by baseballs, but it looks really nice for now! We only have ONE PROBLEM that kept me from giving it 5 STARS - one of the legs was missing the end cap on both sides....obviously we have already destroyed the box and given it to the coach so he is stuck with it that way. Maybe someone will read this and send me a few extra! :)"
1,Do not use,"Do not use this product. I used it on my cat and it caused blisters on her skin, then her hair fell out in those places. And it did not kill the fleas."
1,This is a dangerous product!,"My parents used this product on their cat and she got sick and died shortly afterward. The cat stopped eating and became lethargic right after receiving the medication and rapidly deteriorated. The vet couldn't tell what was wrong with her but assumed it was old age, since she was 16 years old. However, the timing of her sudden illness right after being treated with this medication seems very consistent with the negative experiences being reported by other reviewers here. I recommend that people avoid this product and use something like Advantage or Frontline that is known to be safe!"
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting more from this kindle edition based on the sample I read before purchasing the book. The author seemed to be just repeating himself over and over, and appeared to be basing too much on his own personal experience. The seven steps he outlined did review what I have been taught effectively. He was just a bit condescending many times in the book. Everyones experiences are not the same and there is nothing to say that everyone is supposed to receive the holy ghost the way the author did."
5,"THEE DEFINATIVE ""Trail of the Century"" book !!","Mark Fuhrmans vast expeirence shines thru as he breaks down the whole crime and circumstance.This book should be used in all police academys and law schools on how to solve a case.His words are captivating and let you in on what was missing from the trial,THE COLD HARD TRUTH !!!! he isn't just an author he was there from the beginning.Its unfortunate they used Mark,but he has proven to be a warrior and come out clean and shiny.Look for Marks other book Murder in Greenwich and his upcoming book for true,gritty crime stories....LONG LIVE MARK FUHRMAN!!!! Im glad he's out here in Idaho.Don't miss this book for what the lawyers and judge ITO couldn't get..THE TRUTH!!!!! ."
4,Chilling!,"Like many people who followed the trial, I watched in morbid curiosity while the media and the court set out to influence public opinion about O.J and the ""Trial of the Century"". I never appreciated Mark Fuhrman's position or knowledge of the case until I read this book. To be honest, I expected it to be an attempt to apologize to the country for contributing to this apparent miscarriage of justice. Instead, what I found was a facinating, professional account of the facts of the case. I have also gone on to read his book, Murder in Greenwich, and one thing is certain. Mr. Fuhrman is the man I'd want on the case."
5,"A great refreshing sound,, keeps the great sounds of the 50'","THis is a wonderfull cd,, filled with refreshing clean 50's music ,,rockabilly style,, a great voice that fits just right with the musci.. I love it."
1,Nothing Deluxe about it,"This is the worst layout for a DM screen ever, in my opinion. They set it up sideways, so the screen is shorter in height and longer in width. It's 2 full 8.5"" x 10.75"" sheets, plus 2 8.5"" x 8.25"" sheets, one on each end. So, total size is about 38"" wide and 8.5"" high, with 3 folds. It has some different tables than you will find on the free screen that came with Dragon Magazine when 3.5 was released, but it's also missing info found on that screen. I was hoping for a 5 or 6 panel screen to really wrap around. I usually have 8.5"" x 11"" sheets I clip to the screen for adventure specific reference, but with this screen I cannot do that easily either. They included a D20 Modern screen setup the same way, which I have even less use for. Save your $ and make your own."
1,Deluxe?? Not quite.,"This is the worst screen I've ever seen for any game, it's even worse than those old Judge's Guild screens you'd have to tape together yourself.The single biggest problem is that it's laid out wrong. Instead of the typicsl ""portrait"" layout (meaning the screen is 11"" tall) these are ""landscape"" and only about 8"" tall. Apparently someone forgot the part where the goal is to screen some of the information from the view of players. As one of my players (a noted peeker) pointed out, ""I could see over those screens from the other end of the table"".Don't buy them. Maybe if enough people don't they'll get a clue about what deluxe would mean. I was hoping for something more like the Forgotten Realms screens or the Kenzer & Co screens for Hackmaster. This is a step backwards."
3,Erotic?,"The first half of the book is a page turner and you want to know what would be in the next page, but as many writers, in the second half the only thing they want is to fill pages with letters that doesn't have to do anything with the real story.Neal knew all the time what happened to his father and how, he didn't have to do every thing he did just for revenge, and the epilogue doesn't say anything, you just can skip it and you won`t miss anything..."
1,"If you are getting your ""life secrets"" from a talk show host",Then you really do have no clue. Mr Williams has had hardshipin his life. So have other people. That is not a reason towrite books.
4,Motivating,I am always confused as to what to do at the gym---this book lays it out in a simple format with the clearest pictures ever. Montel writes his personal story--but it is his trainer that explains the exercises and the inspiring details about being a strong woman. I brought this book to the gym with me and it helped me more than the free training session I had gotten. I went to a book signing in Dallas and they were gracious and Wini was happy to answer the questions i had about a specific exercsie. She actually got up and showed me and made sure I understood. I would definitely recommned this book to anyone that wants to start working out!
1,What a waste! heard it all before but this book have less details.,"Heard it all before.. matter of fact the ""fit for life"" book have more detail and that book came out in the early 90's"
4,Continues the great story of the first book.,This book is even more exciting than the first one in the series was. Luke starts the actual training of his students and meets some problems. Admiral Daala comes out of the Maw installation and causes damage to the New Republic. The Sun Crusher is also introduced and is very exciting to read about in action. Just a great book.
5,Fish In A Barrel,"If you enjoy 'indie-films', this is a good one. A new twist on the old plot ""crime gone FUBAR"". It's a movie about friendship too, in a way. From whatever point you choose to view this film, it's got some funny moments that make you think about friends and family .... and strangers you may run into .... hard to describe, but recommended for a good time."
1,Tauzin is a master boondoggler,"Billy Tauzin is another republican with some good ideas. The problem is that his party stands for nothing in particular. Yes, they have their tendencies, but they don't have principles.We have a republican majority, but we don't have republican agreement on anything important. Nothing's more significant that our income tax problem. Having a graduated income tax was not an idea ever promoted by our founders. It came from Karl Marx. It punishes achievement. It was invented to crush ambition.So Tauzin will go in and argue for this NRST, but he'll leave out the step of first repealing the 16th amendment, so then we'll get the worst of all possible scenarios: an NRST and income tax running at the same time-total slavery."
2,Warrior : The Legend of Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen,"When I ordered this book I looking forward to reading about this great man, However the author's constant interuption of the story with his (the author's)innane snippets of life in some of the same places in Africa, almost total spoilt this book for me, If I wanted a book about Mr Chapstick thats what I would have ordered, what I wanted though was a book about Richard Meinhertzhagen. Having vented my wrath, the book does cover his life in some detail, I only wish it had been written by a better author."
2,Tastes like plastic,"While I don't drink much Goji juice, I do eat dried Goji berries regularly. This juice has a very strong plastic taste. I actually looked for juice in glass bottles, but amazon prime pushed me over the edge and I tried this. I wouldn't buy this again."
1,IT's spoiled,"Like other reviews stated, I also received this item spoiled. It tasted more like vinegar than anything else. Find another source with proper storage conditions for food products."
5,A Real Page Turner!!!,"If you haven't bought and read this book yet, then hurry to get it!!! The main characters are great! From the begining of the story I knew Patricia and Evan were meant for each other. They are totally opposites, but that's what makes an interesting relationship. Patricia learns fast when she thinks about having a normal relationship with her childhood crush Rider. I just wanted to jump in the book and shake her! But again, it was all worth the wait, I didn't want to put it down! This book is definitly 2 Thumbs up/5 STARS ALL AROUND!!! Congatualtions to Kieran Scott for writing such a Great Romance for Teens!"
4,Pet Necessities,"I love this pen! Its big enough that my little fur baby has room to play, but it can also be folded in so that it takes up less space while in use. It can be used indoor and out and its tall enought she cant jump over."
3,Pretty Good,"This album is pretty good. As a U.S. hip-hop fan, I thought that there were some good beats that had an unusual sound. Kano is a decent MC, but he has a ways to go. Kano is a mix of grime and US hip hop, so if you're looking to get into grime and just want to stick your toe in the water instead of diving right into the really grimey stuff, this would be the album."
1,garbage.,this movie blows...lara flynn boyle has a tiny little role as a cancer patient in a barrage of cheese-ball scene's that will make you puke out your eyes. AvOiD!
2,"""Complete"" and ""Mastering""??? Nope.","This book is a long way from what its title leads you to believe. Sure its a great book for new divers but I've been diving for ~15 years in a recreational capacity and spent lots of the time diving wrecks all over. I've recently wanted to learn more technical diving and real penetration skills. I thought this book would describe ""in detail"" the gear needed and the proper configuration. Its an overview book to be sure and was written in 1991 so the material is definately dated when it comes to equipment. If your new to wreck diving.. good book. If you looking for preparation prior to a technical wreck class.... save your money."
5,Great - Top Notch Information,What a great book! I could not put it down and this wonderful author even provides a date rape coaster in each book for others to protect themselves and promote awareness. BRAVO!!
1,WORTHLESS!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"This book is worthless, if you study it by itself you will not pass!!"
2,"Who cares, self-indulgent celebrities",Kier is cool. This is not a shred video. This is a documentary on the professional careers of 5 of snowboardings biggest stars. If you give a hoot about thier opinions on snowboarding then you will be interested. It was well edited.
2,It's 2011! This Book Is Now Ancient!,"They need to make a new edition. About half the book is made up of articles that talk about how illustration used to be, how illustration should be and how illustration is now dead (back in 2001). A lot of the articles are redundant I felt. And it wasn't constructive about how to become a successful illustrator in the new digital age. Mostly this book is too old, a little over ten years old, they mainly talk about how the computer and the web destroyed the illustration world, but the kinds of things they were saying were developments of the late 90s and early 2000s. Technology back then and now is vastly different and I'm sure the illustration industry has completely changed again.Only reason this is 2 stars and not a 1 is because I liked looking through the sample syllabi. Gave me some homework examples to try and got a list of several texts/references to read as well."
2,Sucked.,"the book was terrible. the story line catches your attention when u read the back of the book,but when you begin reading it its really bad. i was very disappointed,i was hoping it would be better.i want my money back. at times the author picks you up,but then he drops you back down.i guess he got bored."
4,Under the spell of Yemaya,"Another very good Omar Sosa CD, blending traditional cuban drums and santeria influences to contemporary jazz and hip hop. Rythmically sophisticated and melodically spirited. Afro-cuban jazz is alive and thriving."
1,Not what I was looking for!,"I was so excited when I saw this title thinking it was the original compilation from the 70's, but as someone else already noted, it's not even close. I have been looking high and low for the original for YEARS with no luck. I guess this search is not over..."
2,NO NO YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!,The Diary of Anne Frank is a very informative story i must say. Even thogh I knew what was going to happen it felt like I was reading it for the first time.Though it was very dry during the fighting parts.It started to get better towards the end of the play.If you like adventure or get bored easily I advise you not to buy this book EVER!
4,Ann Frank and the people in hiding,This play was very interesting and I think more people should read it. Also it relates to the movie alote.
2,warning of reading the diary of anne frank,"I am writing this to warn you not to read the book, diary of Anne Frank.I dissuade you to this book.I feel that this book is very boring because it doesn't have up to date words and acts. i believe that this book is also very boring because it's just to long and not interesting, as my opinion.I only like act 2 of the play a little because it adds a little more action to it.The auther could improve this play by putting today's words in to it. It also could be improved by making the story shorter. I think that this play is to long, and boring at the same time for someone to be interested in this story. o' and 1 more thing the author should also put more action in it, and leave out some of the directors notes. Well this is what I think about the book and I dissuade you to read it as my opinion."
3,Lilly the Ladybuy,I bought this ladybug for my son. He loves ladybugs. From the picture I figured she'd be much smaller and wasn't sure of the fabric. I was surprised! She is large and quite an armful when my son is hugging her. And very soft and fuzzy. Great buy! I may buy another...this one may get worn out.
4,Great DVD set for a great price!,Three great Newman movies together for a great price! Great to own if you enjoy Paul Newman's movies.
3,not very conditioning,"This conditioner may be working to make my hair look thicker (my boyfriend thinks it does), but it doesn't seem to actually condition my hair. It smells really weird/unpleasant - almost dusty - and it leaves my hair glued to my head. My normally curly hair doesn't curl as well with this conditioner and is kind of stuck together like a helmet.It also seems to burn my scalp. I use it with the Murad shampoo, so maybe it's the combination of this conditioner with the shampoo, but wherever it touches my skin (face, neck) it leaves it feeling irritated and pink. It hurts less now (~3 month in) than when I started, but it's still not a pleasant experience.So why give it 3 stars? It seems to make my hair look thicker. I don't see it, but others said they do and so far I haven't found any better options for my super fine/thin hair."
3,Whew!!! This is how they do it in the Dirty,"J.M. Benjamin really laid it down in ""Down in the Dirty"". Authors first novel. he takes on a tale letting you know how four friends did their thing ""in the Dirty"". You will get so caught up in the ways of Keisha, Desiree, Tasha, and Pam. These ladies really show these womanizing men who travel to the south to make money and get another notch on their belt(smile) the error of their ways. Read how these four use their sexual pleasures to entice and trap these men to robb or even murder. The story is written so well that you feel the pain that each of these women felt to make them turn into the scheming,robbing, and manupulators that they each become.And in the mist of all of this there is even a fairy tale love story that will have you rooting for love.Well done J.M."
3,down in the dirty,"this book was such a wonderful piece to read, I picked it up and didn't put it down til I got to the end.It was a book that thought me about love and loyalty. It's a fact that you can get good out of bad and what you do to others expect it to come back to you. JM did his thing and I can't wait to get my hands on his next novel, plus he is a wonderful person I met him at the Harlem Book Fair 2006. So bring it on JM."
5,Intensely Personal,"Setting this book in the strange form of exile which eradicates whatever benefits Gombrowicz might have enjoyed from his own greatness in Poland, this outrageous examination of Polish insecurities is better than his strange submission to the greatness of the heroic poets in Ferdydurk, or to the frank realization that he, himself, is best described as ""Up pops a clown"" in his diary. He is not just any writer, but the great Gombrowicz here, because he is filled with a terror that is obviously being cooked up for the world to see. And therefore, what a vividly realized world we see. The difficulties involved in reading this book succeed in making it what it is."
4,Between the Times,Good book; I read it more than ten years ago. It gives a good picture of American mainstream Protestantism in the first half of the 20th century
2,Bad packaging. Should have shipped differently. The wood was broke upon opening on Christmas. Looked cool.,My son opened this for Christmas and it was broken inside. I thought it might be when I saw how it was shipped.It looks like a great kit.
4,fun toy but hair problem,This toy is really fun but his hair is a problem they put gel to make it stay but it stops stiking and then it will go all over the place. I got a prince Daniel and his hair had gel in it to and now he is destroy his hair is a dig mess. I wish they would make Kens hair plastic. But he is a fun toy.
2,Who couldn't see THIS coming...,"As soon as I heard the strings in the opening track I knew what had happened, and I remembered what I said in my Amazon review of ""The Remote Part"". For once I'm not happy about being right. Sorry boys, it's been nice knowing you. Have fun on Top 40 radio..."
4,"A simple, but complete, how-to softcover for beginners.",Ms. Morris has simplified the seemingly daunting process of searching for family roots. The fact that the book is soft-covered and small (easy to carry) makes it inviting for note-taking and record-keeping.
3,Meh...Maybe its Me,I had done a lot of research on this item and really didnt do much I ended up throwing the out because they had no effect at all or did what they were listed to do.
3,Best Show Ever,"DVD came on time. I have baught about 30 DVDs from amazon and i have been happy with the service. But Disc 1 of this DVD was scrached and i could not view the last episode on disc 1, But nothing a little disc cleaner cant fix. And as i say at the end of every review, I will definatley be shopping with amazon again!"
5,Where is the 2nd season?,"I'm sure that the other reviewers have probably done a wonderful job reviewing this set.I just wanted to add that I bought it as a Christmas gift for my family December 2003, not knowing how much they would love it. I e-mailed Fox shortly after my family watched one episode after the other...because I knew my family was addicted. I didn't get a response from Fox, but I hoped that my voice, along with other consumers, would get the ball rolling. When Christmas 2004 came and went, there was disappointment when season number two wasn't under the tree. I had to tell them that I did the best I could. It was sad.Fox, if you're out there...make a family of three happy. Give us the second season!"
5,Awesome DVD for a Awesome Show,"Though seemingly copying The Simpsons but with live people, this show is refreshinly original. Almost all of the shows' ideas are new, especially in the first season. One especially great thing is the absence of a laugh track which really annoys me on most shows and is really nice on this one.All of the episodes on all of the disks are just hilarious, especially:PilotRed DressHome Alone 4Malcolm BabysitsKrelboyn PicnicFuneralCheerleaderRollerskatesSmundayWater ParkI enjoyed every single one of these and could watch them lots of times without getty bored.The Special Features are generally pretty good. The commentary is very insightful and enlightening and the others are fairly entertaining.Overall, with a Hilarious show and good special features, how could you not get this?!"
2,malcolm in the middle,"dvd freezes throughout, a pain to watch. doesnt look scratched. but still skips. not impressed. thanks and have a good day"
2,Good Television Show - Poor Quality Discs,"I pre-ordered this title as soon as I became aware that it was to be released - Malcolm in the Middle is a great show and always provides laughs.Unfortunatley I, like others who have reviewed this title before me, have encountered problems with the quality of this title. The discs arrived loose inside the case and I found when playing them the episodes tended to jump and skip chapters. Also I found the picture quality poor - very grainy and the pciture itself tends to shake and flicker.Great show - shame about the quality of the discs."
2,OVERPRICED!!!!!!!,"This show is a good show, dont get me wrong, but 30 BUCKEROOS FOR 16 EPISODES!!! You can get other great shows, like The Golden Girls, Maude and Magnum P.I., for 11-17 dollars.P.S. Realese more seasons and the price will be a little more worth it."
4,cheech n chong fan,"Its a good show ,its not a movie.But if you like there other movies youll like this .It takes some of there old skits and they revise them to a newer up to date version.not shomething youll watch a hunderd times but still funny."
3,it was ok!,Not at all what I thought it was going to be.... Just a bunch of clips on stage of them doing parts from there older movies... It was ok if you really like them... But if I had to do it over again I would not have bought it...
4,Almost too real,"This movie finds Ernest as a ball retriever at a driving range with aspirations of driving army trucks like real army people. His buddy assures him that if he joins the reserves, he can party every weekend while driving the big green trucks. So Ernest joins up. But coincidentally, his unit suddenly gets called up and sent to the Persian Gulf as peace keepers monitoring a border dispute. The border dispute goes rapidly out of control, and Ernest winds up on the front lines. The fate of the civilized world is in his hands!Given the theme, it's not surprising that this movie is a bit more violent than Ernest's standard kids' fare. Guns actually get fired (but not by Ernest) and people fall down. If you are familiar with the Middle East or the army, you will find lots to laugh at in this movie. However, the overall plot almost comes across as too real these days to be as preposterous as it was originally intended."
2,Browser compatibility is an issue for me too,"Like the other reviewer, I'm disgusted that this product requires Internet Explorer 6 (version 7 doesn't either, you're out of luck if you've upgraded).This problem has been there for ages and Linksys have done nothing to correct it."
3,"not great, but not horrible","I had to update firmware to get SNMP to function. My current versions:Hardware Version 00.00.03Software Version 1.0.0.86Firefox 2.0.0.4 and IE 7 work fine for me on Windows.No problems with uptime or reliability. Seems fast.Documentation spotty and it is hard to get advanced features to work. Support by email equally spotty. If mission critical, shop Procurve."
5,Pleased,"I agree with others that the cards are a bit large and hard to work with. I find the pictures easy to connect with. Compared to other decks I own this one makes for an interesting 'picture' for the client/person you are reading for. There is hidden detail in each card that helps to tie the story of the reading together. It has been a wonderful purchase, I just can't shuffle them as I normally do."
1,underinformed; no conclusions,"I am no difinative writer on the subject of hydroponics, but after reading the material and seeing the sources used in the book, the authors he frequently quotes are very well informed themselves but he doesn't even quote their best concepts. I knew of, and had read some of the authors quoted, and in seeing what the author of this book transposed, there was very little that was clearly defined. Also, the images meant to instruct and help could have been much better in my opinion. This was not a great investment in my opinion. I am not an ill intentioned person, but this book did not help me much in my curiosity about the science of the subject or the practical application. Very wordy, and unconclusive."
3,before watching... dont make any commitments for seconds.,"i dont like that it wasnt rated. does that mean its too inappropriate to be even a rated r? its from bet so it should be rated r. it doesnt say the running time so it makes you feel like it never ends. and it doesnt say if its widescreen or full screen. of course that gets you to pop it in the dvd player and obviously its full screen. full screen is better but thats just dumb. so was it a good movie? sure, but i dont think i will keep it."
4,Good-but not great!,"I honestly thought this book was going to be part of another Princess Diaries series. But to my dismay, it wasn't.This book teaches you how to be a ""princess"", or learn about makeup, good posture, and dining in public. It's funny, but after a while you're saying, ""How much more can I take?""At the end of the book there is a small, funny, make-believe interview, but I felt like I wish the whole book could have been more like that.I would reccomend this book to girls 12+, because it has things like makeup and so on that younger girls might find quite irrelevant and boring!But, if you're looking for a quick read and how to brush up on your style/manners, this is the book for you!"
2,Utterly Pointless,"I would not recommend this book to anyone, even if they love the Princess Diaries.This book is mini lessons from characters in Mia's story (Grandmere, her many personal groomers, Lilly, Lars etc.) about how to be a good princess. Boooring. It's stuff we already know from the story, but presented without the usual wit and humour that we've come to love Mia for. There's the occasional ""funny"" tidbit stuck at the bottom of the page, but the attempted jokes all fell flat.I am not interested in hearing about how to do makeup or which forks to use. To me, that is not light, fun reading material.I view this book in the same way I look at ""Quidditch Through The Ages"" and the Harry Potter spinoffs. Why couldn't the author have spent valuable time writing another good book in the series instead of wasting it with this?"
3,Good Guide Book,"It's a good guide book, like how to be a princess. It has funny commentary from Paolo, Grandmere, Lilly, Tina, etc. But the Princess Diaries books themselves are a better read than ""Lessons."""
1,Very Bad- Can't give any rating,I bought this item for 30GB Zune player. But after connecting it with my Zune player nothing is happening. Zune player is not getting charge with this. Very bad product. worthless.
1,Dept 56 Anywhere Lighting,"This is a very confusing item. And very little is written anywhere on the use of this product, including the Dept 56 website. Apparently it works with houses that have the Display Anywhere connector.....and I haven't found any of those either.I contacted several dealers of Dept 56 merchandise and got very little information.Again, a great idea.....I would willing purchase additional receivers for all my houses if this only worked like I thought it would.It would have been very helpful if Dept 56 had clear descriptions of what the item is used for and how to use it.For now it is packed away hoping it will be useful down the road if Dept 56 items can use it."
4,good,i got the game... tho i was stupid and wrote the wrong address (neighbor's address) i got the game a little late... completely my fault... when i looked online i actualy got the game earlier than the actual delivery time... only thing thats bad... i made a character in special forces so i can get 2x unlock per rank and i love strike at karkand which is on regular bf2... so i played on regular bf2 and i switched back to special forces cuz i wanted to play there and i got a message that said like.... im using a fake serial key so i couldnt play in special forces.... i made a new character to see if i can play on special forces again... and i can however once i switch to regular bf2 i cant go back... i dont really mind cuz i usually only play on stike at karkand so for me it wasnt 2 bad.overall like my ratings say5/5 funi would actualy give it a 9/10 so about 4.5/5 for overall rating... cuz only 1 small mistake and i dont really mind it... tho others might
2,Disappointed,"The recording is professional. However, the ensemble had consistent problems with being together and individual voices often stood out. This is a very average performance, and I was hoping for more."
1,Don't Buy Cycleaware Viewpoint,"Ater multiple tries at adjustment, the mirror lost its tension and fell off the base. Don't waste your mpney. Huge disappointment."
1,Laughable,"Nice idea, but really, this product is a joke. If it ever works, maybe the glasses must have lens that stick down and out like the picture (no normal lenses that are framed and close to the face), but I doubt that is the case. I was never really able to see what was coming behind me. The adhesive also gave out as well, as adhesive generally does. Considering how small it is, I lost it at some point a LOOONG time again."
2,Be Careful!,"I bought this for my husband who just started street riding in our rural CT area and while it works well with his prescription glasses, it does not work at all with his cycling glasses. All he can see is the side of his face and ear. It's a good idea but make certain it works well with your protective eyewear before you purchase this item."
3,nice thought,"It is a nice book of little essays, poems and general thoughts. It doesn't really provide any direction or substance just nice sentiments. If you want some inspirational thoughts it is a good book but if you want practical advice try another book."
5,Beautiful Bride Family :-),"I got the Beautiful Bride Barbie for Grading Day. I printed off three pictures of the Beautiful Bride Barbie to be the babies. I got the Handsome Groom Doll too! Buy her!!!!!! I did, and I don't regret it!!!!!!!!!P.S. She is the most beautiful doll and the Handsome Groom is the most handsome. :-D"
5,CENTURIAN! THE LAW OV BURNING!,"After hearing some samples from this mCD, I have to say that their latest opus 'Chronozonic Chaos Gods' is aLOT BETTER! The vokills are the best I've heard in DM, pure anger, very human anger! No demonic gurgling! Just AngeR & lots of it! NOt too many vocalists can pull that off! The production is a bit raw in some areas, which is great! The guitars, bass, everything is GREAT! ALL 9 tracks are killer! Especially 1-6! This definitely blows aways bands like Nile, Caniple Corpse, Boretician, Cryptopsy (new), Only to be rivaled by Krisiun, Hate Eternal, Immolation, Incantation, Necrophagia, Sarcophagus! Pick up this monsterous piece of devastating DM, NOW! CHAOS IS THE WAY!"
1,Anne of the Thousand Days,"This book was not what I was expecting, nor was it worth the money. It is a thick as one of the children's Golden Books.Would not recommend."
1,Flash and Trash,"Note who has contributed the other reviews: politicians, journalists, hack writers. Lee Cullum offers glib, shallow, journalistic analysis. Every cliche you tune out when it appears on The Evening News or Charlie Rose is trooped out here. A litmus test of what the middlebrow thinks. Or rather what passes for thought with such a middlebrow. It's really a truimph of recycling. Cullum makes noises about the decline of civilization with the rise of postmodernism, and then fulfills her own prediction. Only in our era can the journalist actually pass for a thinker--with other journalists that is, who will make sure this book gets a royal sendoff. Change the channel."
2,Antiquated ideas,"Pauline Hager writes a very concise report of her stay as an Expat in Japan. As a fellow expat that lived as an Expat, I could relate to Ms.Hager's experiences. However what struck me was her consistent faintly condesending way of describing her interactions with her friends, specifically her 'dear' Japanese friends. Here is one of her many dispariging remarks: 'If you have a chance, ask a Japanese to pronounce Mark McGuire'', writes Ms. Hager, after hearing one of her dear friends excitedly describing her sighting of this famous baseball player. I have many more examples, but will leave it at that. Enough said. What could have been a rather interesting memoir, instead, turned this New England reader OFF. Shame on you."
3,Leaky Umbrella,"I've used the umbrella maybe 5 times since i purchased it and it has already started leaking. I'm pretty disappointed because otherwise, it has been great: small size, easy to open and close."
4,Loved this,"Found the first book at the used bookstore, and got this on Amazon. Stayed up last night to read it. It's a great combination of characters, suspense and plot twists. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent Thai cookbook,"I own several Thai cookbooks, but this one is my favorite hands down. Like any Thai cookbook, the recipes require some advance preparation to make the sauces and curry pastes, but once you set aside a few hours to prepare the basic recipes the meals are quick, easy, and delicious. The author's love of Thai food really comes through. I whole heartedly recommend it."
5,One of my faves!,This is perhaps the only cookbook I have where every recipe is a winner. The recipe for mushroom mince is worth the price alone.
4,The First in a Great Series,"This is the first in the Daisy Dalrymple Mysteries. The Honourable Daisy Dalrymple has recently entered the journalism world as a light reporter on the various estates for Town and Country. When she arrives at Wentwater Court, the atmosphere is charged with deceit and deception. Then, when Lord Stephen Astwick is found dead on the frozen pond, her pictures show an interesting twist. Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher is brought in to figure out what happened.This book sets the stage for future novels involving Daisy and Alec. It's light, frothy and fun. The book uniquely captures the post WWI feelings in England, that American readers will find very interesting."
3,Lemon Oil Review,"Enjoyed the oil, although I don't think it's therapeutic grade since it's for aromatherapy use only. Burns well for the house."
4,One of the finest voices in today's music scene,"With her beautiful and soulful voice, Valerie Carter has produced another fine record. Only her third album since she emerged as one of Rolling Stone's best new artists of 1977, ""The Way It Is"" possesses some truly shining moments. The title track demonstrates clearly the wonderful vocal instrument she possesses. She tears up ""Who Is She?"" and shows her range on ""Sea Of Stars"". Despite the lack of a big production she might have received at a major label, Valerie makes the most of it with her unique and emotive delivery. A hidden track at the end, a cover of EWF's ""Hearts On Fire"", easily demonstrates the masterpiece of Carter's fine voice pairing her against an all-star ensemble and dueling vocals with Phoebe Snow. Major labels would be wise to sign the lady and give her the production and promotion she clearly deserves."
5,Excellent compilation,"Rumi is an intruiging writer, and this compilation gives the reader an in depth look and variety of Rumi's work. Highly recommended for the cultured reader."
4,Great Value,"This is a nice product for the cost and is very easy to assemble. It shipped in about a week and I didn't even have to be home to receive the shipment (that is a positive for me). Vision Decor's customer service is great also. I had two small holes in the fabric of the ottoman upon receipt, but after a quick email explaining this they shipped a replacement piece right away, no hassle."
4,Art from the Ashes,This is an amazing piece of work. Some of these poems and stories just grab you and move you.
1,Pathetic,"These two low-lifes are just a bunch of misfits without fathers. The two clowns are angry is their songs since mom never hugged them. ""OooH I'm gonna kill people while rapping"" Their whole approach sucks and doesn't make any sense. ICP should go back to the circus and maybe play for the Carneys (which are probably their long lost fathers)"
1,tears...,"Insane clown posse has become Intimate Christ posse. Im sorry, but i have to tell you how bad this is. I was an ICP fan for a long time. still am really but slayer and venom just takes over. I listened to ICP because of one reason. it was riddicule, crass and comedy. talking about getting hit by a mack truck, thrown around the block and still looking for crack are pretty funny topics. same with digging up dead girlfriends, and carnivals that defy all hell. problem with wraith, is that it is none of these things.The wraith is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard. Why? because ICP decied that what they were doing was morally wrong, and dedicated there live to Jesus Christ. bringing there off the wall ""insane"" dialog to a complete halt.this is what happend. this is this cd. this is NOT insane clown posse. I dont know WHAT this is. it aint what i heard before, thats for sure. if you don't believe me fine. buy it and regret it. i gave my copy to the Good Will. yes i did buy it unfortunatly."
4,Wicked,"I wasen't really sure when I was about to buy this album,... I wanted to buy something different for a change so I picked this up.So,how is the album?Its actually some pretty good stuff!Its wicked rap with a little rock mixed in there,too.It features many great wicked songs and the album is a great length,too(over an hour of music).Plus,theres a free DVD included in every copy of this album."
3,What a way to go....,"This cd is dissapointing. ICP basiclly sold out, especially with the single ""Homies"". There is not enough rap on hear and if anything ide label this a pop album. With only a few good tracks and whack beats, this is ICPs worst ever."
3,Decent book,"I bought this as a reference for a college course, and it seems to be a decent reference for data modeling."
3,Good Book with Good Contents,"This is my first book for the data modeling.1. This book has the wonderful format as it has no much concept reading. Most are dealing directly with how to do and why. 2. This has wonderful example, although it is simple. 3. It does not give me much experienced info about the denormalization."
4,Good coverage of the topic in an easy to read style.,"I must have read at least a dozen books on data modeling and database design in the past few years, and this one sits right near the top for ease of understanding and presentation. The author goes through the material in a logical manner, and writes in a clear way that many other authors on this topic can't even come close to. I'd recommend this book especially to those new to the field, but there is still useful material for those who have been working/dabbling here for some time."
3,solar charge controller (sg-4) from Amazon,"Installed in automobile.the connector wires were stripped,it was ready to install.Don't know if it works but I'll test it out.The unit I had in it would charge during the day but discharge the battery at night,I'll see what happens with this item.One thing the shipping was fast and the box was the right size."
1,reminds me of a porn movie,"This video is very dated and has all the production values of your lower grade porn movie: cheesy music, poor sound, inarticulate monologues---and incest! [one of the dancers is--surprise!--the daughter of the instructor]. Half the time the camera is just focussed on the wall. It does give some instruction, but is painful to watch. It's barely worth $6.99, much less $23.99."
2,wrong dimensions,The dimensions given were for the outside and don't help in determining if it will fit over my thermostat.The product itself would have been fine if it fit correctly. Maybe there should be a size in between the two given so you wouldn't have a monster size box to cover the thermostat.
5,mom,It was a pleasure buying from this seller. The glasses are beautiful. Great purchase and the price was extremely reasonable.
3,mediocrity from a near genius,"this album was created during the artist's period of heavy acid abuse, he said so himself, and unfortunately it gets in the way of his genius. this album is way dark, just listening to it will make you want to cut off all contact with the populous and join a cult. so be careful! i'm serious, there's a disclamer on the cd cover that protects the record company from litigation from upset friends and family of the listener. this album is an interesting side note if you are a fan of T power but it is not for the faint of heart. for a better idea of his talent, check out his album and LPs out on S.O.U.R. records or, if you can find them, the LPs in the 1998 Alphabet collection labeled ""C"" and ""D"""
5,Neon Gumballs,Being an event planner you like to see items before you purchase them. I wanted the colors to match my party decor and be a great addition to the candy bar.The color of the gumballs were so vibrant. They matched the color scheme of my party perfectly! Shipping was pretty quick. I contacted the shipper to let them know I didn't ask for expedited shipping.but I needed them pretty quickly. I was very pleased with the quality of the product and plan to order from them again soon!!!
2,An unruly self-important novel,"Whence all the 5 star reviews? One of the great political thrillers? Seriously? A cross between Malcolm Lowry and Dostoyevsky? I must have missed something. Stone is capable of some very fine writing, for sure. He's also capable of some very incoherent writing. And if the incoherence was meant to serve as a metaphor for the incoherence of history or of American foreign policy or of anything else, then it's a metaphor that fell flat early on in this very very over-long novel. I've read many a so-called great novel that was richly deserving of the moniker. This one struck me, after the first 200 pretty compelling pages or so (hence my second star), as a bore from then on. A long, painfully slow, and highly pretentious bore. I couldn't wait to be done with it."
1,I'd rather eat dirt than listen to this album.,"While these guys might have some inkling of talent, you wouldn't be able to tell from their loud, overused sounds. They are an imitation of an imitation of a rock band. The only saving grace in this band is the drummer.P.S. Get a new lead singer."
3,Portable Companion,"Some positives:* The type is large and easy to read. The quality of the pages, typeset and binding are very nice.* The color paintings are beautiful and supplement the text wonderfully. The format, layout, and size are great, especially if you happen to be in less-than-optimal reading conditions (e.g. low light.)Some negatives:* Originally published in 1973, this prayer book doesn't contain the Luminous Mysteries, and the instructions for praying the rosary are outdated.* There are some typos, misprints, and missing headings.* The caption on the painting of the Annunciation has the Jerusalem Bible translation, ""Rejoice, Oh highly favored"" instead of ""Hail Mary, full of grace."" I would have liked a prayer book that used the traditional wording to show the biblical roots of the prayer.* Many of these prayers are very old, and Latin translations for some of the more ancient ones would have been welcomed.All in all, a nice prayer book."
2,Small,"Not at all what I expected, nor was it properly represented. Not what I was needing at all. I don't like it."
5,Love this Pocket sized Prayer Book,"I love this prayer book which is the perfect size to carry in my pocketbook. It includes morning, afternoon and evening prayers and I especially like the prayers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. I think this would be an excellent gift for confirmation or a newly confirmed convert, as it has the basics like Major Parts of Holy Mass included, and some of the basics of the Catholic faith like the Seven Sacraments. Of course there are all types of prayers, including the rosary, prayers to the Saints, pretty much all the basic prayers plus some."
2,Disappointing documentary,"I do not think it really explains what an Embassy does and what and Ambassador is and represents. It is a rather confusing presentation of different situations and experiences. Unfortunately there are very few films or videos on diplomacy, that is why this DVD can still be a useful tool for those interested in diplomatic activity."
1,not the same songs as listed at Amazon,"I needed a particular arrangement of a particular song (Don't Cry for Me, Argentina). When the CD arrived, it has the same title and cover picture, but ten totally different songs on it than Amazon lists: 1. Where or When, 2. Brazil, 3. Fascination, 4.Besame Mucho, 5. Blue Tango, 6. Opus No.1, 7. The Theme from A Sukmmer Place, 8. Night and Day, 9. Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White, 10. I'll Be Seeing You."
1,Just bad recipes,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is bad and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains some wasted recipes such as white rice, tea, a very basic fried rice and egg drop soup. The rest of the recipes are just very average to bad.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
1,Poser!,"This is just like the song ""no scrub""! If they keep on copieng then nobody will like them! Please make up something original!And i would have given it o stars but the lowest is 1!"
4,cute movie,"This is a cute movie. Ellen desided to surprise her newly wed son & the bride has never met her & she is trying to throw a dinner party & has hired a maid to help her & when Ellen comes to the door before she can say who she is, the bride thinks she is the maid & drag's her into the house. When her son arrives home she tells him not to say who she is & just keeps helping to get ready for the dinner party. She wants everything to go right for her new daughter-in-law."
3,"I hate to, but","I bought this on the strength of the band, and yes they are great musicians all. But this record just doesn't work for me. Shawn's voice sounds a little to pushed, the keyboard solo's seem to wander and what makes the guitar sounds so great electric, just isn't there for me. I mean no disrespect to the band, but I just can't get into this record. In some ways I agree with the much maligned evolu10484. The new feat is great in ways that the old feat were not, and vice versa. I have Waiting for Columbus in my player now........"
5,a good cd,"Ive seen them live; they are very good. The CD is good, track 8 especially. Also, know that Joe Johnson strums his own bass and plays the gut bucket with hairy palms."
5,Some of the Republik's most daring fashion experiments,"For a short time the bureaucrats who ran East Germany decided to bring some style into their lives, hiring professional photographers and models to represent fashion and socialist achievements. OFF THE WALL: FASHION FROM EAST GERMANY 1964 TO 1980 documents these daring images, adding a set of intriguing color photos rarely seen in the West to the chronicles of world fashion history. Some of the Republik's most daring fashion experiments come to life under the hand of photographer Gunter Rubitzsch, who hired local models and chose socialist-inspiring backgrounds to display fashion."
4,Dream Walk,"On a keiko Matsui album, you'll find a wide veriety of styles.Dreamwalk, for me, is the closest to one style. It's thestrongest melodically of all her albums.She's a strange artist, dfferent songs will appeal to differentpeople. Some works sound totally differnt on one album to another,so i'd listen carefully before making you personal selection.There's no doubting the talent."
2,"GRIMEY,GRIMEY",I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WHEN I GOT THIS BOOK THAT IT WOULD GIVE A BANGING ENDING TO BLINDED.THE CHARACTER KAMERON WAS NOT AS ILL HEARTED LIKE HE WAS IN BLINDED. THEN YOU ONLY HEAR OF PRINCE AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE BOOK. IT JUST DIDNT GIVE YOU WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
2,It's a waste of ya money,For one i have to say that Blinded was da bomb. But trust me you can do without Grimey. Grimey was less than good. She didn't do a good by following up Blinded and it's kind of hard to write a book when the main character is dead. to me she could have just did an epilogue to tell what happened to Cam and how everyone else turned out. It's just a waste of your money and time
4,Still got love for th BAD guy,OK OK I know Cam was a bad guy but I couldnt help but feel sorry for him. I gave this book 4 stars because though it was good it's no sister souljah it lacked something I cant put my finger on exactly what it was lacking but it didnt have the same effect on me as blinded
5,skills to look within,"An absolute must,for those who seek to understand oneself and the world we must make sence and live in. I'm having ball reading it."
1,I received what I ordered and it is not compatible with my car,"Article received 5.81250K Eibach Pro-Alignment Performance Alignment Kit (This product does not fit your 2006 Ford Focus ),my car needs is the item Eibach Pro-Alignment Performance 5.81310K Alignment Kitthis is not what I ordered and is not compatible"
1,mostly bad,"this is a terrible tribute album with songs done mostly in one take without much care. easily my favorite song on here is ""holiday"" by the fizzy bangers. you can tell they really like =w= & didn't just learn the song in one day & spend 15 minutes in the studio. i suggest ""rock music: a tribute to weezer"" for a tribute album where the bands put much more care into the songs they were covering."
5,A wonderful walk,"This truly is an awesome overview of the metanarrative of the Bible and how humankind fits into that narrative. Even better, it can be read in a single sitting. Highly recommended to all new to the Christian faith and for those curious about the reason Christians claim a unique perspective on faith and life."
5,Wonderful voice.,"I heard one of her songs, Gravity, by chance but immediately i wanted to hear more. So i looked up her up and got a chance to see some videos where she played a piano and sang. Now of course that is not rare at all but the thing is, her music was able to bring our emotions in me. Its beautiful, sometimes cheery, sometimes sad, bittersweet, longing, somehow freeing and light. I greatly look up to her.This Cd can be a great gift to anyone who likes great music and female vocals. I never wanted the songs, or cd, to end, its just so powerful and moving.5 stars! (would have given more if it was possible)"
5,A Worthy Talent and Musical Wake Up,"This is an outstanding album without any unlistenable tracks. Vienna Teng is a rare talent whose words are poetry for all ages and her music is polished and provocative. She has serious challenges as an artist: her art does not fit neatly into any of the recording industries narrow little niches. She transcends several of them and makes her own beautiful place. Her songs are beautiful, smart, lyrical and listenable. Buy the CD. You will not regret it."
3,(sorry in advance) Gal singers are 'A Dime A Dozen',"There's a horrendous degree of competition in today's market, isn't there? Vienna's voice is more 'whiny' than smooth, as compared to say, Dido's (My current fav). But I'm sure that Vienna Teng will carve out a place for herself; taste is, after all, a very individual, private matter."
5,praise from a fellow musician,"as a musician, i pay close attention the excellent arrangements on ""waking hour"" - the instrumentation, layering, and mixing is superb. add to that talent: the depth of thought in vienna's lyrics match the music. her voice and playing has a combination of softness and a power that remind me of tori."
5,A true masterpiece,"What do you call this music? Sophisticated, intelligent pop? How about brilliant? Expect to get chills the first time through some of the songs, particularly the first few. The Tower features masterful instrumentation and arrangements, while Momentum is stripped down to just piano and Vienna's lovely voice. Both types of songs work extremely well on this album. Also, check out Gravity, Between, and Drought. Vienna's meaningful lyrics and the album's first-rate production stand out. Oh, and did I mention her voice?"
2,Ouch!!!,"If you love Meredith Brooks music like I do, you do not want this album.If you actually enjoyed the 80's MTV pop era, you might."
5,spectacular rice dishes!!,"I think this is a great book my rice was not mushy at all and my vegetables and meat came out nice and tender. I got this book last week and yesterday the spanish rice I ordered online arrived and I made the chicken and eggplant paella. It was deeeeeeelicious!! I can't wait to make the other recipes. They are very easy to make and the hardest part is actually getting all the ingredients ready and cut to make the paella. After that, your home free!! I would definitely recommend this book!!!"
2,Disappointed,"This product does not stay in your ear w/o the ear hook as it claims. Kind of flops around. The buttons are difficult to manage. You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not. It goes into sleep mode after a short amount of time but doesn't reconnect to the phone unless you request it to do so, sending calls to voice mail. The ear pieces are difficult to change out to smaller or larger. The part of the ear piece that goes into the device breaks easily.Not going to buy another bluetooth product that goes in my ear. They don't fit small ears well and they're not comfortable with glasses."
3,Replacement,"I bought this as a replacement to the 655e model that I lost the first day I wore it. The clarity is good but the ear hook easily comes off, so it can (and will) fall out of your ear. Neither Amazon nor Plantronics offer a replacement headset, so you have to purchase the whole kit again :("
4,Good headset for the money,"I have tried a lot of headsets with various results and this is one of the best in terms of sound quality. It may not have noise canceling but it sounds better than my Samsung which does. You get used to in it your ear. Like others have said, the buttons are hard to push but I find that this allows me to keep it in my pocket without accidentally pushing buttons. I really like the little battery charger. It can really save you on the road."
3,Not what I expected...,"Pros: nice design, unobtrusive, decent voice quality and volume. Portable pen type charger very clever and convenient. Very light.Cons: when wearing headset on ear buttons are difficult to find and hard to press (you have to press so hard it can actually be painful). The removable ear piece (even the smallest one) is too hard and uncomfortable. It causes discomfort and even pain after 15-20 minutes."
5,RICHMOND ROULETTE,"MUST HAVE-STR8 OUTTA RICHMOND,CALI- C.I.N. DROPS THEIR 2ND ALBUM & ITS HARDCORE W/THAT K-LOU FUNK-RIP J.JONAH(TROUBLEMAKER ON 94 MOBSTAS)-PEEP GAME-LOOK 4 C.I.N.'s 1ST 2 TRACK MAXI-SINGLE EP ON CASSETTE ""CRIMINAL IMAGE""-1990"
5,Must have for a SG-1 fan!,This collection has some excellent and funny special features. And buying this as a set saves you a great deal of money. I highly recommend this dvd collection.
4,Some favoritism for Jackson,"The author is best known as the biographer of Jackson, so understandably he shows some favoritism for Jackson.He covers the essentials of JQA's life but very briefly as intended. The book serves its purpose as a concise biography of a president whose life was intimately connected with the history of the first six decades of the United States."
5,John Who? Adams,"John Quincy Adams was the sixth President of the United States, but much less well known than his father John Adams, the second President of the USA.In this splendid biography, Robert Remini has provided us with a concise volume detailing the life of John Quincy Adams. Within this book, it is easily seen why JQA is rated as ""below average"" as a President, but highly regarded as an international diplomat.Remini has done a spectactular job in describing the whole life of John Quincy Adams, and helps us to understand why Adams' life is being reclassified as more successful than previously recognized, despite the fact that his Presidency was a failure.I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a basic understanding of Adams the man, not just as the President."
4,Theragear Memory Foam Pillow,"I had no experienced with this item, I brought this pillow since 2009 for my friend as a gift. I saw his painful & suffering from hurt his neck! I am not a doctor; just a good caring friend, I just tried to helping in his case. I asked him if he likes it or this pillow helping any? He said, ""Yes, thanks""!"
4,"Very Good, but .......","The book continues the adventure, but lacks the thrill of the other books and the serious quest that it tries to be. It is however very well written and entertaining. Left looking for more than a quick happy ending and a deeper sense of purpose. Too much time spent on describing places in chapters and not enough in others. Good reading."
4,A Feel Good Film,"I stumbled on this film while looking for something ""up"" to watch. It also doesn't hurt that I love dogs and have one that rescued me. That's what happens in this film, Cooper the dog, rescues Jake, a man who has lost his family. The film goes through Jake's grieving process while you learn what Cooper's real mission is. If there is one thing I didn't like it was the ending; that's the only reason I rated it 4 stars rather than five. In addition, I live in the area in which this film was made; kind of like seeing home through someone else's eyes."
5,COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY !!!!,"WORLD'S WILDEST COLLEGE PARTIES is everything it claims to be -- and then some!It just doesn't get any better than this guys -- YOU WILL LOVE EVERY SEX-CRAZED MINUTE!! These young, gorgeous, hard-bodied college girls get OUT-OF-CONTROL! Each of these sexy co-eds are HOT HOT HOT, totally REAL -- not models or actresses faking it! -- and caught on tape taking it ALL off & doing things you always WISH the girl next door would show you.I'm never getting suckered into buying another boring Girls Gone Wild video ever again!!!It was non-stop in your face heaven from start to finish -- This is a video you will watch OVER & OVER again!My only complaint: Why can't there more videos out there like this one!?!?!?! 5 out of 5 stars"
1,"If you're looking for ARNOLD VOSLOO, he's hard to see ...","Okay, okay, I like many other people on Amazon fell in love with the Mummy Man. So I ventured into the cheesy world of Red Shoe Diaries hoping do some drooling. After watching the first two stupid stories, finally Vosloo appeared in the third ... from the point of view of a woman in the next building. Most of the story shows Arnold at this distace until he finally confronts the woman and we get to hear his lovely voice for a few seconds. He is briefly involved intimately, but once again, it's seen from the other building. Oh well. Someone write a good role for this man fast!"
2,A gimmick SACD,"If you want to listen these CCR SACD in a multichannel sound, forget it!!! I bought these SACD but the sound is in Stereo. A hybrid stereo SACD. A true gimmick!!!"
3,Camp rock 2,"I watched this movie on the Disney channel and I dont think Id buy it on dvd simply because I thought it had way to many songs in it and not enough movie,it had like 13 songs or so in it and I bet if you took the songs out of the movie it would only be like a 1 hour movie or less. Bassicly I would have liked to see more movie and less songs but thats just me."
2,Doesnt fit convertible car seats!,"After a lot of searching for a car seat shade for my toddler who hates having the sun in his eyes, this shade appeared to be the best pick. Turns out, the fit is way to small for our convertible car seat. The description on the packaging clearly says that it fits all infant/toddler car seats. My husband had to struggle for an hour to get it on. It does not sit right and bows up and blocks the drivers view through the rear window. We currently use it because we have no choice until I find an alternative. I only gave it two stars insead of one because it does actually work to block the sun. If you are thinking of purchasing this shade, be sure you have a small enough car seat to fit it."
2,Reasonable But Not Great,"Terra Kettles Cut Blend Potato Chips, Sea Salt, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)While these chips are crisp, they feel and taste too oily for me. The per serving fat listed online is 6g while the bag lists it at 10g. Since the bag contains 2 servings, that would be 20g per 2 oz bag. They are packaged in stronger material than other chips I have tried."
2,vague.,"Breaking a little ground but steps into too many things without finishing them. Also, too short of a book for the subject."
4,Spirit of Snoopy,"I saw the musical during its short run in the West End and think the album captured the spirit of the musical-short, sweet and witty. The music is catchy, the lyrics are fun and the whole album is entertaining for children and children-at-heart. My favourites are ""I know now"" (how true) and the motivating ""Don't be Anything Less..."" You don't have to be a fan of Peanuts to enjoy the album but if you are, will understand the reasoning behind a couple of the songs."
4,THE recording of this musical,"This is the definite recording of the semi-sequel to You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. Energetic orchestrations, fun vocals (even if the interpretations aren't the strongest they could be). The (now) classic Just One Person is done very well on here, as are the majority of the songs. No, it's not You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown, but it's still a lot of fun."
4,Great hairdryer,"This hairdryer works exceptionally well, and dries my hair in about half the time (10 minutes). The only downside is that it is noticeably heavier than a regular dryer."
4,GREAT purchase,It's a little heavier than I thought and louder. But it works great. Happy with the product. Would recommend it.
1,Smoke,"I got this blower dryer for Christmas after I had picked it out and had it on my wish list. I decided to make sure it worked before I threw away all the packaging. As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell. I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel. I waited about five minutes and tried it again, same thing happened."
1,Fire Hazard,"I've owned this dryer for around a month. I was excited as it's a fairly light dryer with multiple settings. My first hint of a problem was having difficulty getting the attachments to stay on the nozzle. And then one day I put an attachment on when the nozzle was already hot - well, didn't that create a big dent in the shiny plastic! It was totally melted! I decided I could live with that because it was merely cosmetic, BUT over the past 10 days or so, the handle has become unbearably hot to hold if drying my hair or my daughter's hair for more than 5 minutes! I don't know what is going on, but I'm sending it back before it sparks or simply melts in my hand. I would stay away from this dryer!"
4,"quick drying, easy on the ears","This is a very good hair dryer, especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers. If you like myself have been buying Conair or Revlon dryers since you were a teenager then you'll appreciate a step up from those. This dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat. Better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers. A solid purchase."
3,Only Jackson Browne DVD available,"I recently attended a live performance of Jackson Browne and was impressed that he looks and sounds the same as years ago. So I bought the only available DVD concert of his work. It is good but fluffed up with various interviews and retrospectives. They also used the technique of splicing several performances of the same song which I find distracting, quite the opposite of a live performance. At the end he has a unique voice, nice body of work, and worth the listen."
3,Gone Home,I feel the music was interupted to much for the story line and history. For me it took away from what could have been a great music DVD.
1,never arrived,"The book never arrived at 3 weeks, so canceled the order and hope the charge is reversed on my card. Woody's books was nice about the problem and sent me a $5 check to aid in buying the book at a higher cost in a local book store."
4,Good read!,Racina's Snow Angel gave me an enjoyable day of reading. Found it very difficult to put this book down. Most definitely one of his better reads.
4,Hobbit for the classroom,Not a bad supplemental material book for The Hobbit...I got some great ideas! The only thing I would like would be more high level activities for high school.
5,A breath taking adventure!,Just reading this book set my eyes to tears it was so compelling! The hobbit was an awesome book and the author has many a talent. I hope you read this therefore feeling the moving story of The hobbit. It's the best book I have ever read.
5,ENJOYED EVERY WORD,"A wonderful read here. Not only do we get a very interesting plot, but a lot of good trivia also. Very good character developement along with a very smooth syntax makes the entire book a joy to read. I am not a big mystry fan, but this certainly could turn me into one. I was also quite impressed with the research which apprently went into this book. Being a gatherer of facts, I found the information in the book to be quite factual and as I said, informative. Thank you Ms Albert!"
3,"Almost, but not quite...","I've read most of Wittig-Albert's books,and I've liked them. This one, though, attempts a stronger thematic element: relationships between mothers and daughters. And in an effort to let the reader know that this is NOT just plot, but an examination and a message, she over-does it. There are several sets of mothers and daughters whose stories are woven here, to the point that we want to cry out, ""Ok, ok. Enough! I get the point."" Now, who killed Wylie? Add to that some gratuitous recipes and a ghost who conveniently leaves old diaries around and trails lillies of the valley scent throughout the house, and you have one long and slightly boring experience."
3,Say Good Night to Insomnia,"The product was priced reasonably, shipped promptly, and received in good condition. It provided a substantial amount of helpful information and was definitely a worthwhile purchase."
2,Nothing New in This Book.,"This is information that I've heard before. Nothing new. There are only 10 pages in the book that are actually useful. You're better off buying the book ""No More Sleepless Nights."" It's much more informative, comprehensive, well-written and useful than this book."
2,All Looks No Substance,This headset was defective because I could hear other people but they could not hear me! What is the point of that? Also-the plastic had a sticky feel and smelled strongly like chemicals. Pretty purple color and that's about all folks!
3,"Bad Phone, Great PDA","I have been using this MDA for over a month now. It is a great PDA considering the price. With the newest Windows Mobile 5.0 which comes with all the bells and whistles, this PDA is definitely a bargain considering it's price. However, I am not using the MDA as a phone. The reception is very poor especially when you are indoor (in a building or even in a little hut). It takes about 5 minutes to find service signal after you left the building. The speaker volume is too soft and same for the ringer, so you will have a hard time using it as a phone when you are in a noisier environment (like when you are outdoor). Then if you go search for a quieter place to talk (i.e. indoor) and you loose the signal. In conclusion, if you want a great PDA, get this MDA, but dont expect it to work well as a phone."
1,Read before you buy,"I have had this phone for just about a year. Just before the one year contract was about to be over, the stylus started slipping out of the phone. I lost 2 quick stylus's in quick succession. I called T-mobile to report this problem, and I was told that the warranty period is over and that I should call HTC( the manufacturer of this phone) to get the phone fixed.I later researched on the Web and found out that HTC's design is pretty poor.A lot of people had problems with the stylus holder in the MDA.Cons- Clumsy to hold in the hands(Quite slippery)- No easy way to dial without a stylus- Difficult to navigate contacts( A wheel scroll would have been helpful)- Phone is very delicate and cannot be handled roughly, like a phone.- Poor warranty, when you are spending a fortune for this devicePros- one less device to carry, if you use a PDA and phone"
3,Good PDA Phone,"I have had this phone for almost a year now. I have not had any major issues. Though a little slippery to hold. The bad part about the keyboard is that you have to use two hands for it. I have been reading about people losing their stylus', I haven't had that problem so far. I have added a 2GB mini SD card for my tunes. Although this phone does not like Macs, it is a good windows device which requires occasional reset. A built-in task manager would help."
4,A Real Pleasure,"I'm in love with this gizmo. It does so many things right. Form factor is great, screen is great, keyboard is great, works flawlessly with Goodlink, and my reception in LA is awesome. I can't believe how fast I'm browsing just using EDGE service. Plus, I'm surrounded by wi-fi options.One caveat it that I use this strictly as a data device, and not a phone, so I may be avoiding phone reception problems that are driving others mad. I really have no complaints. Wish it had more memory and better native application management, but there are apps out there that apparently improve these aspects.Great device. Highly recommended."
4,discontinued product - wait for the Atlas,"T-Mobile has discontinued the MDA. A newer better smaller version is supposed to come soon - maybe the end of May 2007.A number of small imporvements - more speed, better camera, smaller size.See HowardForums dotcom for more information and rumor"
5,What an Experience!,"The Lord of the Rings was the very first Fantasy series I read as a kid, and I always wished someone would make it into a movie. This was well worth the wait! I don't think they could have chosen a better group of actors to portray these characters if they tried! I saw the movie 11 times, and would have gone more if it hadn't been removed from the theatres. Until it came out, Star Wars (the original) had been my all-time favorite. Well, guess what? It's been replaced. To anyone who has not seen it, please do! I don't think you'll be disappointed. I took a friend who had no clue about Tolkien, or fantasy, and she came out of the theatre practically panting for the next one! This is a movie not to be missed."
3,flimsy packaging?,"I bought this for $7.99, seemed like a great deal - but the packaging is very cheap and flimsy. Not sure if they had two versions of the packaging - one they sold for $7.99 and a better quality one for the normal price. Have yet to watch the movie."
5,Theatrical Version of the first installment: brillant.,"The Fellowship of the Ring, theatrical version, is in my opinion, the best movie of 2001. Therefore, of course you need to own it on DVD. The amount of special footage that Peter Jackson and his crew have stuffed on these DVDs is unmatched these days.However, if you have to decide between the extended version and this version, I would go for the extended version. Unless you're an obsessive fan and need both anyhow. After seeing the quality of the ""cut"" stuff from the Fellowhship EE, I realized the main reasons for their editing was either time or some sort of minor pacing issue Peter Jackson had. Neither of which are a problem on DVD and I would by all means, rather have the extended version."
4,Good Movie but bad DVD,This movie was great but why do you need two DVDs for just a 3 hour movie? The widescreen version is too small unless you ahev a 40 inch televesion. The added scenes that were directly put into the movie was a kool effect.
2,Bored of the rings,"Over long, run of the mill fantasy tale that just drags. Just because this is one of the original fantasy books doesnt necessarily mean its any good. It may have influenced plenty of stories but most have far surpassed it. Some of the SFX in this film are downright embarrassing. It was ok to watch once on the big screen, I couldnt make it through a second viewing. Give me Krull anyday."
4,Arrived promptly exactly as described.,"Pleased to receive Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings DVD Special Edition in quality condition. It arrived promptly, exactly as described, and met my high expectations."
1,It could have been awesome,"but instead its merely boring hollywood crap dressed up in ""magical"" special effects. The acting is subpar for the most part and many of the characters are really non-existant. The book is ten times better. If your idea of a good movie is the Matrix than you'll love this. This is my own opinion so dont freak out because I dont fall for hollywood garbage."
2,One Bad Movie,"The first half of this movie is very good. I love to listen to story and there are people telling the story... physically... in the first half of the movie. It really draws me into the plot. However, story telling disappears very quickly in the second half of the movie. The second half of the movie is filled with cheap special effects that don't do anything to the movie in my opinion. You see people running around smashing this and that mindlessly. There is virtually no dialog... no story telling... The second half is so bad that I actually want to leave the movie theater. If I have to compare this movie with another movie, I will say that the movie Princess Bride is a much better 5-star original. I have never read Lord of the Rings. So, I will go see the rest of the movie when it comes out just to see how it ends. If the second movie is bad again, I will skip the third and go buy the book and read it instead."
5,Taking movie to a whole new level.,I think this movie is a really great movie.The special effects are so asome.I think all the actors looked so cool.The fight seens are so cool.It's so cool how they make all the actors so differnt than what they're really like.I think the whole movie made very well like all the props are so cool.I like the end because that's when the effects were really cool because they had to fight the monsters are really well made.My favorite part is in the begining when both army's are fighting.I think the effects are really cool at that part.
3,this movie is long and boring,this movie is to long and to boring it is a good movie in parts of it I haven't seen the second movie yet i bet its better because the first one was an introduction to the people and the land so hopefully I'm right about the Two Towers being better
2,I did not think people should really get this.,"I think the way that this movie was made. The widescreen in this title was not very good. You can not see the whole screen from a widescreen tv. You would think that the people have televisions sets that are full screen. So, I am hoping you are trying to make this a fullscreen in the box sets."
3,Change for the sake of change,"OK, it's a good movie. I've seen it three times. But I'm still disappointed with how far it strays from the book. Both FOTR and The Two Towers contain countless deviations, with many of them appearing to be changes just for the sake of change. Some are minor, some are huge. Don't worry, I'm not going to list them.Also, in the movie Frodo looks about 12 years old. In the book he was 50 when he left the Shire. I know ring bearers don't age much, but c'mon! Couldn't he at least look 33, which was how old he was when Bilbo gave him the ring?"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best movie ever made. I loved it. When I saw the movie I had to read the books. Now I can't wait for the next one to come out. It's all about this ring that was created by this dark lord. In a battle the ring gets cut off of his hand and he dies. Then the ring gets lost for a while and a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins finds it. Later he has to give it up. His nephew Frodo gets the ring. He finds out the dark lord is bound to it and that the ring is evil. So he goes on this big jouney to destroy it. It was a fantastic outstanding movie and I recommend buying it. If I could I would give it ten stars. So go out and buy it.""three rings for the elven kings under the sky,seven for the dwarfs in their halls of stone,nine for the mortal men doomed to die,one for the dark lord on his dark throne,in Mordor where the shadows lie,one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them,one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them,in Mordor where the shadows lie."""
3,The book ends break too easily,The bookends break in to a million pieces and are hard to put back in place. Don't use them as bookends. Place them down low and towards toward the back of a shelf. The paint chips too. I love the DVD.
2,very good movie but ?,"lord of the rings is a very good movie the colors are nice and smooth the action and effects are very good but as you get deep into the movie and to the end , the drama just runs out of gas and poof movie is over just like that i think the movie in its self is ok but at least they could of gave you a better ending than what they left you with which put a sour taste in folks mouth after buying this movie."
4,Kids liked it also,My second view but first for the kids. They really enjoyed as I also did even for the second time. Just viewed The Hobbit in the theatre very disappointed :( Many changes from the book.
4,CG Artists,"Not sure if any focus group work will be done with the Amazon reviews, but if anyone who's working on LOTR is peeking at these, *Would you please use walk cycles on the CG characters that are at least a little dissimilar? Even if you just have 2 and alternate them between characters, it should be enough to fool anyone's eye.It's so hard to go back and watch the Moria scenes -- Crossing the bridge, Descending the staircase, running through the great hall... You all know what I'm talking about and I'd like to see a little variation.Thanks!"
5,Extended Version Definitely Worth Seeing,"In the interests of keeping the movie to a certain length, the director was forced to cut scenes that fill out the story and make it a far richer experience. To put it simply, this extended version has material that makes the story work. When I saw the movie in the theater I was disappointed that the rhythm of Tolkien's story seemed lost - but clearly the director had it all in mind as he was making the film. This is the movie everyone should have seen. Superb."
2,I fail to see it ........,"Despite it's accuracy to the original story, I fail to see why this movie is such a big deal. Yes it has a lot of good special effects, and yes it has a pretty decent cast. But it's nothing spectacular by any means. Some people I know are going nuts over this film like it's the greatest film ever, again sorry - I don't see it. I don't recall Frodo being such a weiner in the book."
2,read the fine print,"Although I have yet to receive mine (pre-ordered), I will be returning them...I assumed that one disc would have the theatrical release and the other the extended edition.The only reason I wanted them was to save the trouble of switching the discs...So I will be sending mine back for a refund.I should have read the specs before buying, so it is my fault. I am a ""collector"", but not that big of a collector."
2,Cut in Half?! Disappointing.,"The movie is a masterpiece, and the extra scenes greatly enhance the movie, but the fact that it is cut in half annoys me to no end. It would have been a simple matter to keep the movie as a whole. It would have easily fit onto one dvd. Hopefully they will put out another version that has the extra scenes without splitting the movie in half."
5,Lost in the Rings of Fantasy,"The movie was excellent. I had read the book (3) times and whatever the movie could not fit in length of time I remembered and filled the details in myself. The characters were captivating and you were drawn to them. Each had their own individual strengths that pulled you through the movie and left you with the need for more.Within the ""Relm of Man"" .. we are allowed to escape for a little while through movies and the magic of the Lord of the Rings allows this happen."
5,Wow is all I can Say,You will be blown away by the extra sence you get to view in this collection . As well as the Masterpeice of the movie itself .. As a collector I have never seen anther set like this it goes beyond all ratings that could ever be bestowed upon it !
1,"Theatrical Versions ONLY, NOT EXTENDED","This product is not actually the extended edition as Amazon lists it as in its own review of the product...the information in the ""WHAT YOU GET.."" section of the review is not correct, this is a 1 sided blu ray of the THEATRICAL cut of the film. This is still an excellent film...just not the product advertised. I'm having to return all 3 of these movies now for the correct products...FIX THIS AMAZON!!! ((in all fairness, this specific disc is not mislisted, but the other 2 from the same set release are, just make sure you want the THEATRICAL version only before purchase))"
5,My Favorite,"I love it,I love it,I love it,Nothing like this Extended Edition,WELL DONE WORK ,Mr Peter Jackson rocks :P"
5,FANTASTIC,I saw this movie and its the only one I want to see againand again! The characters were cast perfectly. OrlandoBloom as Legolas is wonderful. His beauty portrays the elfI had in my mind. Aragorn was also fantatic! I highlyrecommend this one!
5,Big bonus w/ extra footage,"I love The Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Ring. MY sister bought the extended version and lent it to me. When I sat down and watched it I couldn't watch my regular DVD after that and had to get the extended version for my self. It explains so much to people who have certin questions about the regular DVD (movie version). It makes it about a half an hour longer which is pushing 3 1/2 hours, But WOW it is so worth it!!!"
4,Grandly Entertaining,"The first entry in Peter Jackson's epic Tolkein trilogy is a grand visual extravaganza, not only technically amazing but also an emotional exercise in storytelling. On its own, it is impressive; if all else goes well, the trio should be even more remarkable as a complete whole. If anything, the film is worth seeing for the way it looks and sounds. The entire picture has the authenticity of a fairy-tale illustration, and Jackson's whipping direction is as exhilarating as it was in his previous film, the masterful, disturbing Heavenly Creatures. While it feels a little uneven--the long, long middle feels like one damned thing after another--it's a thrilling first act, and the satisfaction will come when and if the sequels manage to be even better."
1,BORING,"This film, and it's sequel, were a nice reminder never to beleive any hype in the media when it comes to movies, no matter how pompous. This film is was mass-comsumption, like a Big Mac. The characters were so simple and undeveloped, that the film quickly becomes boringly, annoyingly predictable, no matter what fight, fantasy 'people', or any other situation turns up."
2,Beautiful and boring,"I guess we live in a different universe. My wife, my daughter, my son, my daughter's boyfriend, all of us could hardly wait for this dim witted movie to end. It starts beautifully. I'd love to live in Hobitland or whatever its called. Gandalf is pretty cool looking, but he isn't a very good wizard. he doesn't seem to have much power. From that point on the plot goes meet one bad guy, vanquish the bad guy, meet the next bad guy, vanquish that bad guy. It seemed endless. No plot twists. No surprises. The villains are all conventional looking monsters. The orchs look like they were cobbled together from a half dozen horror movies. From the ecstatic reviews I was hoping for some of the magic of the first Star Wars, but alas, this movie seems to me to be the latest case of the emperor wearing no clothes."
5,Lord of the rings-The Fellowship of the Ring,Peter jackson..told another greatest fantacy like South Indians... 'Chandamama Kadha' He remembers 60's southindians Greatest director B.Vithalacharya .
1,Whats With All The Hype?,"I seriously do not see what the hype about this movie is.It is horrible.When I saw it at the movies,I had to leave within the first hour.It's that bad.And what's with the time this movie lasts.3 hours!! Movies like this are not supposed to last 3 hours.It's okay for biography movies and stuff to last for 3 hours,but with these types of movies,it is just ridiculous.This movie is a very boring one.There is not even one interesting moment about this movie.Do not see it.It does nothing for you except take away 3 hours of your life.Peace Out."
3,Only just a 3 too...,"Well, I thought this was very disappointing.My wife and I found it so slow going that we ended up watching it in two sittings and even then she fell asleep in the second half.Amazingly, she found she had missed nothing when she awoke 20 minutes later!The effects and scenery were very nice, but a film needs so much more than that for me.To sum this film up I would say it was just very very slow."
5,I was at this one too. It's still not how it happened.,"""It wasn't just like the book. Peter Jackson wasn't close enough to the mark. Where's Tom Bombadil? THE BOOKS WERE BETTER!"" BLA! BLA! BLA! BLA! BLA! I've had enough of the ""fan boys"" complaining about the fact that the films are not ""like the books"". That's because these are what people living in the present like to call ""films, or movies"". Give peter Jackson credit where it's due. Nobody makes truly epic films like this anymore. The man's discovered a lost art. As much as I like George Lucas, he can create a universe from nothing and transfer it to film. Peter Jackson used the real world and made sure that a great deal of time, effort, and care went into presenting this ADAPTATION. If it were just like the books, people would have fallen asleep or walked out after the first 100 page narrative. GROW UP! ENJOY LIFE! WATCH MORE TV! DRINK SOME ALE AND SMOKE A HOBBIT PIPE WHILE YOU'RE AT IT!Sincerely,Bilbo Baggins"
5,The Fellowship of the Ring,"Brilliant! Peter Jackson made a perfect choice of actors and actresses.Very sad when Gandalf the Grey fell down the hole and when Boromir of Gondor was killed by the Urak-Hai leader.I was in tears!Very emotional ending when Sam and Frodo started for Mordor on their own.Also a perfect beginning of a perfectly amazing movie.I liked the hobbit holes in Hobbiton.They were very realistic indeed.The special effects were fantastic aswell,especially the Rivendells and Lothloriens Elves' ears.All in all,a brilliant movie altogether!I compliment Peter Jackson,the cast and crew and not forgetting the Author,JRR Tolkien!Truly magical."
5,LOVE IT A MUST SEEEEEEEE Seriously,"I really did not want to see this movie, I was like no it's stupid and I would never want to watch it ever. But my sister finally got me to watch it, and IT WAS AMAZING. I wanted to watch it again and again. I then saw the second one and Loved it even more. I now own both of them and I have watched it at least 100 times. I can't wait for the Return Of The King to come out on dvd. May 25th. I AM HUGE FAN. I wanna have a second breakfast too:)"
3,WAY OVER-RATED,"I know I'm gonna catch flack for this but come on, i could have read all three books and the hobbit before the movie ended. It was poorly done, and Wood's performance was less then entertaining. However, not the worst movie i've seen, but not nearly deserving of being called a masterpiecce. I give it three stars because of how the plot changes speed to frequntly, the ... acting, and Elijah woods poor job. Good effects though and sendoff of the characters. also good job with bringing the mosters to life (make-up/costumes). Overall very disappointing."
5,"THE MOST ""ORIGINAL"" EPIC EVER!","THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masteriece! It is, without a doubt, the best film ever made, or the best film made in the last ten years at least! Even with awesome visual effects and intense action and adventure, the film never loses the novel's emotional depth or scope. Captures the essence of the novel in spades! It has great characters that are played to perfection, and has a wonderful score that deserved it's Oscar. ... This film is DEFINITELY worth the time! All 178 Minutes of it! If you haven't seen it, then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Grade: A+"
4,"Very Long, But Very Much Worth It","I was very exicted as was my area when this movie came out. Everyone was so excited in fact, that my whole section ignored the [person] behind me that was cussing at everything he didn't like. That was the intense effect on people from the movie.It was a great adaption to the Fellowship of the Ring (the book version). The battle scenes were so intense and the special effect swept you off your feet. My favorite part was when the Felloship was fighting the hordes of orcs in the forest near the end of the movie. IT was great! And you were warped into the story deeply (everyone jumped so high when Bilbo lunged at Frodo). I gave it 4 stars because it dragged on a fast-paced story into a long, LONG movie. But it's a got-to-see movie and I recommend it to veiwers who love the Lord of the Ring series, mystical movies and Harry Potter."
1,an awful movie,"LOTR was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Don't waste your time or your money on it. Too long, too boring- I almost fell asleep. What a waste of a perfectly good 3 hours!! Usually, I really like movies that I see in the theater, but I hated this. I don't even want to see the other two. I feel bad for the hundreds of millions of dollars people have wasted on this movie."
2,Nice Try!...,"Hay you cant fool me, I know a ""flamer pride"" movie when I see one. It all came together when Frodo starts to float away in a boat, and his ""partner"" Sam expresses his true love, by choosing to drownd, rather then leave Frodo all by his lonesome. But when Frodo comes to his rescue, tears are jearked between them. And lets be honest, when (Liv Tyler) the elf princess confronts him in the woods by the little bird bath in her underwear, What would you have done? I dont think my point needs much more explaining. The fairies and hairy men in loin cloths should have gave it away; but if you still need more proof, explain to me what thoughs four young hobbits were up to, when they rented a single bedroom away from town, next to a dark saloon?"
1,unhappy,i got this movie but all i got is case and no movie will not buy from doolicty inc. again u lost customer
1,Unable Now To Take it Back ;(,"This one I received sits here in the shipping box. Sits here now for one month because it DOES NOT HAVE THE DISC TWO of the 'Extended Version Discs. INSTEAD it has Disc ONE and then followed by TWO of the DISC ONE of the 'The Appendices' and then followed by Disc two of 'The Appendices'.It WAS AN AMAZING SCREW UP AND MISINFORTUNATE EVENT THAT I DID NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE !!!IT NOW SITS HERE AND I SEE THAT TIME HAS RUN OUT TO TAKE IT BACK !!!I TRIED ONLINE AT TARGET ( your sister company, I see,..) AND BOUGHT IT THERE AND GOD BLESS THEM AS MY LUCK MEANT THAT ONE OUT OF TWO OF THEM, IS ALL COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MISHAP AND FINE AND ALL IS READY FOR MY VIEWING !~K. What do I expect from the extended movie itself?,..Only the very Greatest of Epic Proportions ! How do I feel about the packaging of this product and it's contents?,....Super Let Down and a HUGE RISK To take when ordering multi-disc DVDs !!!~ K."
3,Not Better than Harry Potter but still worth a look,"This is a pretty good movie although I felt Elijah Wood was not the best actor for the role. At times the movie was a bit slow moving. I plan to buy it for my collection but I still think that Harry Potter was a MUCH, MUCH better film."
3,Lord of the Ring,"The first hour and a half went fast and was very interesting, however the next hour and a half went very slowly because the many battles were repetitious and unbelievable that four adults and three children can beat full armies of tyrants. Also I notice that some scenes showed the horse and some scenes forgot the horse, even in the aerial shots when the group set out over the mountain to reach Mordo."
2,Its pish,"What is most vexing about this filming of LOTR, as an action movie, is that this, and at least the next, generation will, in the main, be robbed of their initial personal interpretation of one of the greatest stories ever told. The films is fast, loud and garish, leaving it for those intimate with the novel to add space, hue and texture as we watch. The mysticism, morality and horror of the story are reduced to a string of action pieces loosely strung together by abrupt nods to the original storyline. Those who don't benefit from familiarity with the book are experiencing an exciting film, perhaps, but one which, in its narrow focus, leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of telling the story it purports to.I would implore everyone to read the books before viewing, as you will lose forever the chance to experience it anew."
1,RIP OFF,"This edition is a ripoff, pure and simple. For those who already have the DVDs, do NOT buy this! There is very little extra footage on the second disc, and some of that was already included in the behind the scenes portions of earlier releases. Costa Botes is great and filmed LOTS of footage that I would love to see. Unfortunately, very little of it is included here."
4,ok,"Yeah, all criticisms of the changes made to the book in this movie aside, it was pretty good. Most of the actors were well chosen (except maybe Elrond) and I would have liked to have seen Glorfindel, but all in all I was satisfied (my brother, who has read the books about a million times, hated it but watched it several times anyway) In particular i liked Liv Tyler as Arwen, and the CG and costumes are all very well done. Some of the scenes could have been done better (in particular the council of Elrond) but like I said I did enjoy this and its about as good as you could do with condensing the book into 3 hours. But Gimli didnt kick enough ... in Moria and Legolas didnt fire arrows nearly fast enough"
3,"Fun and Geeky, but LONG","Before every swords & sorcery geek in all of Middle Earth cast a spell on me and turn me into a chicken or something...let me just say that I ADMIT that I'm in the strange minority that didn't really enjoy this film. I don't know what it is...it just does nothing for me (except induce deep sleep and cause my buttocks to go numb after prolonged exposure to the seat I've been in for the last 20394830 hours watching this thing).It was fun and even interesting in some varied parts. The visual style of the film is quite impressive. The digital effects are seamless. Elija Wood plays a heroic hobbit, and the rest of the actors are also extreemly well-cast. It was fun and entertaining and I'm not such a cynic that I can't say I enjoyed some of it.I just find this type of stuff to be boring and pretentious. This film tries too hard to be epic and important. In the immortal words of David Spade (who I actually [don't like]), ""It's called an editor...HIRE ONE!"""
3,"Great DVD set, but why is there no Full Screen Version",Great DVD. Loved the extra scenes. However a full screen version would have made people with smaller TV sets a lot happier.
4,Curt's review,I thought this movie was very good. Although it would be better if they hadn't skipped so much of the book. That is why I gave it a four star rating.If you are debating seeing the movie I say !GO!It is very action packed and I would not recomend it for young children. ....
5,Great DVD to your collection,"Great movie alltogether! The hobbits,dwarves,elves ect. look so strange and different! Absolutely a great part to your collection"
4,Beautiful cinema...,"This is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone. Slightly higher to anyone that has never read the book. While the movie is true to the story it tells, it overlooks quite abit of the hobbit characterization that is found in the book. However during the movie this is an easy thing to forgive, and it's impossible not to be swept up in this epic story. I eagerly await the next installments."
5,our expanding view of the world tolkien created,it is only the begining to something impossible to fully understand and that is the ever changing lord of the rings series evn today we are only starting to understand tolkiens master piece. this motion picture involves the contents of the first lord of the rings book. this is a must see for all even if you are not a fan of the lord of the rings. i have much praise for peter jackson the director of this movie.
1,I don't like these types of movies even if they're good,"I love sci-fi or intellectual movies, whatever that means. However, I don't like three hour boring movies. I never read the books, which I'd probably enjoy, but this movie was bad. I saw it a long time ago, during it's cinemtic release, not on DVD, so I have forgotten, thankfully, what the lord of the ring is about. I think if you where it you're invisible for three boring hours and than everybody sees you, gets angry that they looked for three hours when they had not a chance of finding you in the first place and than you escape your impending death by putting credits up so you get a a one year head start on a bunch of guys with swords and shields."
3,Lord of What???????The Movies??????,"Okay,Lord of the Rings was mediocre,It wasn't SO bad that I would walk out,but it wasn't THAT great!Okay,the movie had great special effects,obviosly it had a great story,but it was still Terrible...well,maybe I'm Being to harsh,just I personally didn't like some parts of it....So I'll mark the good and the Bad of it....GOOD THINGS:1.Great scenery...2.Speicial Effects....3.The Make-up,it was Really realistic........4.Actors,Most were awesome......5.Story......BAD THINGS:1.The monsters,I'm 12 and it still freaked me out!2.The Battles,why does everything have to be so gruesome?????3.Did I metion the Monsters,demons,devillike things,goblins,and everything else????Another thing I did not like was the fact that they portrayed this film as a family film,it should definetly be PG-13,But I would've waited 'till I was about 20 to watch this if I knew what really went on in it!Hope this review was helpful to You...."
1,The Lord of of the Dingleberries,"What is this movie but a bunch of elves, dwarfs and fairys running around and killing each other over a wedding ring? It's all bad acting from the word go, and the music can't hype up what the story lacks. I have a theory on why people love these movies; they feel that because the directors and actors and writers try so hard to make an ""Epic Saga of Biblical Proportions,"" that they (the movie-goers), must give the film makers positive reviews just for the effort. I am different. I will not give good reviews to a movie just because it's ten billion hours long. Good is good, fairyish is fairyish and my time is too important, as is yours, to be wasted on this midevil drivle. And now I will cast a spell. I call it the ""I'm to influenced by movie advertising and special effects to think for myself spell."" See, it's already working. Now go out and see the whole trilogy, fairy."
4,Wait for the Director's Cut,"I've been waiting for a movie version of Tolkien's masterpiece ever since I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 25 years ago.My initial reaction was happy but a little unsatisfied, wanting to see a book that was truer to Tolkien's story, but repeated watchings have changed my view for the positive.There is too much about this movie that is excellent to list it all here. The soundtrack, the scenery, the actors, the special effects and Peter Jackson's vision for a movie. Its all just fantasic. But I'm going to force myself to wait for the Director's Cut which will be released sometime in October/November. With an extra 30 minutes plus extra DVD's it will represent a real seven course movie feast."
2,Over-rated,"After all the Oscar hype, and all the good reviews from ""normal people,"" I am inclined to believe that perhaps my view is just jaded.I will give the movie credit... it does a good job of sticking to Tolkien's original book. However, the action scenes are not spectacular. There are sporadic impressive action scenes, but nothing on a grand scale like you would expect from a Tolkien based movie....P>I was NOT impressed."
2,This won academy awards?,"I watched the movie, with avid Tolken fans as my guide. I was just as disappointed as they were.The hype of the movie really failed to bring it to light. It spends a lot of time mired in long scenes where nothing expansive of plot driving really takes place.While the actors were well picked, the much talked about special effects left a lot to be desired. Some of the digital backgrounds felt detached, and if there was human style movement, the figures were robotic.A lot of the plot and dialogue is easy to determine just due to the events that need to take place before they could be allowed to die. The dialogue sometimes just goes on and on when a few sentences are needed.A few of us even laughed with the whole opening flashback involving Sauron.Overall. Not really worth the three hours spent. We hope the Two Towers will be more compelling."
3,Some technical difficulties,"The film, over course, was phenomenal. We twice lost our connection but once that was fixed, it was fine. The picture quality was fine too."
2,Long and boring,"Being a big fan of sword and sorcery movies I eagerly anticipated the release of this film. Unfortunately this film is so long and boring it has difficulty keeping the viewers interest. The film has high production standards and is well shot, but unless you are into the book series its a waste of time."
3,Over rated,"Jackson's version of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is somewhat disappointing. Although the cinematography and cast was of great quality, his inconsistency to detail, diversion from the book and jagged scene to scene jumping has left me utterly disappointed and dumbfounded of what all the hype is about. There were a few sub-plots that Jackson chose not to investigate to the fullest (eg. the broken sword) and yet he chose to add to a few plots of his own. I can only hope that the next two movies are an improvement on the first one."
1,Horrible!!!!!!,"I havent read the books, and this movie was totally confusing. I guess its only good for people who have read the books... IN my opinion, it stunk!! You could not get into the movie, like you could in Harry Potter. I personally think that they should have made a movie on the Hobbit (i read the Hobbit)instead of the Lord of The Rings, because it would have been much more easier to understand by people who havent read the books... This was a major disapointment, and a waste of 3 hours..."
3,Not bad,I know everybody is raving about it but I think you have to be a child(or a child at heart) to enjoy it. I liked this sort of stories when i was seven but that was a long time ago.
2,a rare find . . .,and what i mean by that is this . . . i fell asleep on the movie THREE times. THREE!! and that being the case i suggest watching this movie at your own risk. what i really am most disappointed about in this movie is that it was really long . . . and i wasn't expecting that. i just wish i was warned about that. and i haven't seen the sequel and and don't know when i will . . . only after it comes on cable a couple of times . . . because the sequel is longer than this one
5,Wow!,"First of all, if you are looking to work out your home theater system, this will certainly do that! I really enjoyed this movie and can't wait to see what happens next. As a child, I used to devour books with this theme. This movie was everything I every imagined and more. I thought the special effects were fantastic. Also, it is a good movie that you can enjoy with your children or grandchildren. Mine certainly enjoyed it!"
3,The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum,"While the visual effects were very good, the screenplay left something to be desired. I enjoyed the movie greatly, however I regret having read the book before I saw the movie. I do realize you could never cover the book in its entirety in a three hour movie. However, the director took some sharp turns from the book, I suppose to make the movie watchable by people who havent read the book. There are several parts of the book that are left out, which in my opinion are pivotal to the overall theme of the story. Also, there are situations added in that were never in the book.The worst part is the way some of the characters were written. Gandalf is written (in the movie) as a doddering old man with underlying power. Gandalf in the book was never goofy like this.If you plan on watching this movie, be sure to read the books AFTER you have seen it. You will enjoy the movie much more."
1,Not impressed,I would not recommend this item. It is hard to explain. Someone just plucked a bird or two and stuffed a feather or two in the fabric.
4,It's a wiffle ball and bat,"It's the one you remember playing with when you were a kid. Great for breaking open a pinata, and fun for just playing around at a picnic."
5,Classic game for cheap,Arrived soon and still provides me with the enjoyment of watching my son swing like a rusty gate at the ball.
4,nice coin,Good looking coin. The string part was a little short and a little too soft material. I may switch it to a longer leather strap
3,Not that easy to clean,"I purchased this item after reading other reviews about how easy it is to clean. While it is nice that it all comes apart, it is NOT that easy to clean. It is too large to soak which is what it needs to get it clean. Its too large to put in the dishwasher as the spinning parts of the dishwasher would hit it. I have learned to spray it down with Grilling Pam and that helps with the clean up.It cooks food wonderfully though. One of my favorites on this is fish. Its much better the say a George Foreman because it doesn't dry out the food like the Foreman does."
1,Heating Element fails,"DON'T BUY THIS GRILL. I've had this electric grill for a little over a year. It hasn't seen heavy use at all. I had family over yesterday and tried grilling sausage - the kind that are already cooked and just need heating.....the grill just couldn't get hot enough to even warm them up! Later, I tested the grill with an oven thermometer (with the lid on) and it did get up to 300 after 10 minutes. Just not hot enough to grill ANYTHING, especially with the lid off."
5,Electric In-door Grill,"I bought this grill to replace one I had recieved years ago. This grill is awesome and is used on a weekly basis. It is easy to use and clean and has grilled everything I have thrown at it to perfection.It is very easy to clean,heats very quickly and works very good for a grill in and apartment where grills on the patio are forbidden due to fire safety.I would recommend this too anyone wanting to grill anything their hearts desire."
4,-1 Because of MTV,"This is the definative Dashboard Confessional experience at home. If you have never been to a DC show, this is what it is like. The number one complaint people seem to have with this CD/DVD is that the audience sings too much. Guess what, that is a DC show! Chris Carraba, the lead singer, has always said that he wanted the audience to be a part of the band. Singing along to every song is how they are a part of the band. If you want to just hear Chris, go buy any of the other CDs. However, if you want the real experience without the sweat and standing in line, get this DVD/CD. Can't beat the price, especially for something MTV has their hands on, which is why it didn't get 5 out of 5 stars."
1,13 Year-Old Campfire Sing-along,"If you enjoy the prepubescent sounds of a junior high school girl sing-along, like at a YWCA summer camp or Brownie convention, this is the album for you. These preteens sing all the words to their favorite Dashboard Confessional songs, complete with the raw passion and frustration that pimples, algebra exams, and unrequited love for Justin Timberlake bring. Somewhere in attendance is Chris Carrabba, singer for Dashboard; you can hear him at times in the background when the girls choke back a tear or take a sip from their juicepacks."
2,Just a lot of little things...,ok well1. Dashboard Confessional has always been unplugged with a few exceptions2. Screaming girlies kinda takes away the moody part of it3. some extra bass and drums and stuff4. ...you should protest [MTV's] stuff until they go back to how they had been with ONLY music videos and no reality shtuff :-PSo it's 2 stars cuz of the 2nd reason is one star and so is the 3rd and the 1st and 4th together are like half each (probably a little more by my standards but my standards are weird) so it gets back that little extra bit cuz it has all the good songs.Everything else by DC though is awesome (The Places You Have Come to Fear Most is I think the only full length album but I'm not sure. It's got a lot of good songs though without all those other little annoyances.)
4,nostalgic santa claus european style,"Captured in a side view, Santa Claus is adorned in a golden frame outlined in Christmas Ivy and berries. The style is reminiscent of european Christmas pasts."
1,incompatible with windows media center 2002,"I'm really disappointed with what appears to be misleading promotional material and packaging language which indicates that the Zune is compatible with Windows XP. However, it is NOT compatible with Windows Media Player XP with 2002 or 2004 versions. This should be made very clear. While my temptation is to return the Zune for a refund, I've ordered a 2005 version of windows media player xp and hope that it works. Wish me luck!"
1,Never received item The business cancelled the order because the could not provide it.,"I ordered 2 Zune's on Black Friday and the Company that Amazon contracts with did not let me know that they could not deliver the Zune's.Not only could they not provide the Zune's at a resonable price, did not let me know that I was not getting them until the day they were supposed to be delivered.I did get the Zune's locally (With Out Amazon's Help)3 weeks later and before Christmas and I am sure my children will enjoy them."
3,Can't play MSN Music!,"Outstanding, gorgeous, powerful, easy to use.... BUT, I'm shocked to learn that any music I ever downloaded from MSN Music (that is currently in my Windows Media Player library) in the past will NOT transfer to my ZUNE (doesn't matter that MSN owns both) because of the new digital coding that ZUNE requires. You either have to rip, burn to CD, and create MP3's of your prior downloads before the ZUNE will accept them, or buy the music again from ZUNE! This is the device to buy if you are starting a downloadable music library today, but if you already have a downloaded library, good luck!"
2,30 GB Zune,"Upon opening package on Christmas day, the USB cable was found to be defective and it will take a week or so to get it replaced. This put a damper on what should have been a great gift for my son since he can't really use it."
2,Zune,"I wanted to like the Zune but after having to deal with a ton of software and hardware issues from 3 of them, I've given up on it. I have an iPhone now and the iPod that comes with it is all I need. I love my iPhone/iPod with iTunes because IT WORKS."
4,Zune 30 GB,"It's a great device, lot's of memory and features. The price of 80$ was the cat's meow! I like it."
5,very nice player,"i bought this item as a gift to my girlfriend and she absolutly loves it, it is very easy to navigate through it. the software that came with it is easy to use and is helpful. but the only thing is that i had to buy an additional software to convert video and dvds so that i could put it on there. but besides that i love it."
5,30 GB Zune,"Actually, I bought the brown one, but I have to say, the iPod killer is real. So much more for the money and every bit as easy to use. Not a single crash so far, unlike my previous iPod. Apple may control this product market, but it's not based on quality or value - just being first to market and having no real competition early on. Microsoft got it right with Zune in every way but the stupid name!"
1,not so good,"Most mac users probably won't be buying a Zune, but I thought the price was good and I wanted to try something new. Of course I knew it didn't play well with mac os, but I had Vista installed on my mac, so I figured it would work fine with that. It did work, but it took me a long time to get it working and get my music on it. Once I had my music transfered, it did a fine job of playing music, but the interface was not the best I have seen. I would prefer the sansa one over the zune interface. The wireless transfer thing turned out to be a flop for me since I only know one person with a zune, and we couldn't get it to work anyways. Pretty much, I felt like I was stuck with a huge 30gb mp3 player. Yea, music worked fine, but I was expecting more. I'm trying to return it, and now I'm gonna get a sansa. If that thing flops I will go back to an iPod."
2,Get a zune,"If you can't tell the difference in design, features and quality between a zune and the iPod-you should definitely get a zune. Afterwards, drive home in your Yugo, take off your leisure suit, put up your feet on that crack-a-lacken Naugahyde couch and crank up those bontempi slow-jams.Yes, get yourself a zune-I insist."
4,Satisfied!,This is my second one. The Market Place is a lot more user friendly than it used to be and it doesn't take forever to sync anymore. Great!
5,Love it so far,"I've only had this for a few days, but I am loving it. I must say I ordered this from Amazon the day before Black Friday for $89., and if it hadn't been so cheap, I wouldn't have bought it. I have a 1GB Creative Zen Nano that I also love.The unit is very substanial. It has a solid feel. The picture is great, as is the sound. I love that they just upgraded the software to allow wireless synching. I wish it came with an AC adapter.I listen to a lot of podcasts from NPR: Wait, Wait, Car Talk, Story of the Day, as well as music. I used to have to be careful to erase the podcasts so I wouldn't run out of room. There's no worry about that now.One thing that puzzles me is why so many mp3 players, this one included, come with magnetic headphones that stick together. Yea, it looks cool, but it doesn't really have any function. and magnets and magnetic media don't mix."
3,Zune,"Overall a decent player, could have used better sound and equalizer options. When playing songs or podcasts doesn't save at last stopping point, you have to restart all over again. Nice display"
2,iPod Killer? Not Yet...,Pros - Very cool design. Nice feel to the Zune.Cons - Battery Life is very low on mine for some reason. Its bigger than my iPod video. The sharing thing that thay are advertising so much is not all that. You can only listen to your shared song 3 times in 3 days. Thats not sharing at all! They should call it a sample from your friends. Other than that I should have went ahead and bought another iPod.Additional Thoughts - Not ready for the market yet. The software is a PAIN to install. And the sharing with other people is really a joke. It still does not give you the control that you should have over your own media. Good idea though.
4,Nice product!,"Have had both the Video Ipod and the Zune. I prefer the Zune over the Ipod. Better software, and better interface. Just wish the accessories were cheaper, come on MICROSOFT! If you want to beat APPLE, you have to do better in this area."
2,A mediocre product at best,"It isn't just its well-documented install problems. The Zune just looks and feels cheap. The fake-out click wheel interface adds to the aura of chintziness. The Zune software is an unneccessary second step--why not use WMP?--and the Microsoft Points are silly. The lack of podcast support is unforgivable, the inability to use it as an external hard drive is insulting, and the wi-fi is useless.The screen is marginally larger, and even though it is the exact same resolution with the same number of pixels, it does look slightly more attractive than Apple's iPod does. However, that is more than undone by the sheer unsexiness of the Zune casing, and the inelegance of the clunky interface.Now, it's not a terrible product. It's a slightly ahead of the Creative Zen, for example. But it's still well behind the SanDisk Sansa, and even farther still behind Apple's iPod and iPod Nano.All in all, I would stay away from the Zune."
5,The perfect gift,"I purchased the Zune for my boyfriend as a gift, and he loves it. I was debating between this and the Ipod video, the only difference was the price. The Zune was about $100 cheaper, and it has a FM radio as well. It stores up to 7500 songs and holds videos as well. It's a great gift for both teenagers and adults as well."
1,WHAT A JOKE!,"I also just had to try one out for myself. What a piece of junk! I'm no iPod lover, but this thing pales in comparison. I felt like I was carrying around a sony walkman. The fake click wheel took me by surprise as it's just simple buttons. The software and store r simply ridiculous. Almost impossible to use. CRASH- CRASH CRASH. you can forget about syncing this thing. The battery life is terrible with WiFi on. Which brings up the next point. I found the WiFi useless as nobody I know in their right mind will ever buy one! I gave it a week and sent it back.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!"
5,Simply awesome.,"In my house we have all the Zunes and they all are still looking great! Yes, this is bulky, but being Microsoft's first mp3 player it was well done. There are few mp3 players that can get to iPod, making Zune devices the closest. I love Zune, and love how durable they are, sound quality and long lasting!Highly recommend. I agree, Microsoft should have and still needs to market Zune better."
3,"Note bad, but not great","I use an MP3 player to listen to audio books, music, speeches, and soundtracks. I find it really frustrating that I cannot bookmark places where I was listening. I should be able to have several bookmarks where I can pickup where I left off with whatever I was listening to before I was interrupted. (I have a Ceative Zen that had that feature & was smaller but storage and battery life pushed me upto Zune.)The Zune PC software is a hog and poorly organized. I should be able to rearrange the view of the material and the menus on the Zune itself. What you see on the PC doesn't translate well to what you see on the Zune, so I constantly think I have good organization on the PC, only to find out while I am driving that I can't find stuff I know is on the Zune.Had I to do all over again, I would have gone with iPOD, which isn't perfect either, but has better human factors engineering & designs."
4,Good one,"The product delivery and all that was perfect. The player is pretty good. But had some headache with the software installation. Guess M$ needs to do some work on that. The Zune marketplace never works... so forget an interface life that could match the iTunes. I would have appreciated a list of pains with the software before. As far as the music play and video is concerned, its pretty good. A lot bulky though. I guess they need to be a lot more aggressive in making it as popular as the pod."
5,Zune 30GB,"Great deal! This product was in excellent condition, and a great deal at $50 cheaper than the stores!"
1,It's not what it looks like,"It's not supported in Vista.The Wi-Fi is not usefulSo far I cannot get the Wi-Fi to do anything. I can't get it to connect to the internet, that's not supported. I can't play or download songs directly from the Zune via WiFi. I can't sync to my computer with WiFi. Wi-Fi will search for and find other Zunes nearby. (no one else has one and I doubt they will for a while) If someone else had one I could send songs for a couple of plays.The screen and such...The screen is nice but video and images look about the same as they do on the iPod. To me there's no real difference except the sideways video thing that increases the viewable area minimally.The navigation button thing...It only looks like a click wheel. It's a funky hard to get used to button thing. I'm used to the iPod that has always had an easy natural feel. This is a ""clunky"" way to navigate compared to the iPod.The software and music store is unnatural and confusing. why points? why not just dollar amounts?"
4,Pretty good.,"The zune 30GB works fine for me except that the software it provides is a little bit complicated to use. And I can't use it as a moveable hardisk, which sucks. but otherwise, it's perfect."
5,It's a great product,"I just got mine yesterday and I have to say that I am pretty impressed. I was surprised at how fluid the menus moved and how well it felt in the palm of my hand. The video quality is very nice, and I like the blue glow that the thick transparent plastic cover has. I would have gotten an Ipod, but every time I tried a demo unit out I was afraid I was going to break it. No worries about that with the Zune, it feels nice and sturdy.I see people complain about the thickness, but I don't see what the problem is. Overall I found the software to be pretty self explanatory. I think the people that are nit picking the Zune are probably Apple fan boys, do us all a favor and go back to your steamy Steve Jobs fantasies. Leave the real reviews to people that actually own the device."
4,is good... is good.,"Good things about the zune:-Accepts lots of file format.-Doesn't have the annoying touch wheel like Ipod.-Clear easy to use interface-Has a normal FM radio (awesome obvious feature)-Good Wifi-Clean clear large screen-Nice weight and size. (Not for everyone, but I like the weight). Feels more robust than ipod.-awesome connectivity with Xbox and Windows network-you know that a large percentage of your money isn't going to tediously trendy commercials and marketing.Bad things about Zune:-Software is slow. (PC, not device firmware)-Screen is relatively easy to break (Get a case and you'll be fine). Mine broke, but i bought a replacement for $40. Took me about an hour to swap and it's good as new.-Not as many accessories as ipod, but getting better.No brainer.Get a Zune."
4,I like it,"the interface is more or less user friendly, even to those like me... who can't be bothered to read the instruction manual. I have friends who complain that their ipod batteries don't last long, but my zune battery lasted for days before my first home charge. I also hear about ipod lockups... I've had nothing like that happen on my zune. the only issue I have with the zune is the video transfer proccess. for some reason, I can transfer mp3s but I'm having trouble with video.but as I mentioned before, I haven't read the instructions ... so I may still figure that out.I'd be happier if zune included a clock."
1,Zune 30 GB,"I purchased this product from Justine's Electronics. All of the reviews were good so I thought Justine's was a reputable company. The purchase was for my nephew who lives in another state. The Zune battery life is only 2 hours. It should have a battery life of 12-14 hours. After inquiring, I was told by Justine's to buy another battery. Wow! I could not believe what I was told by that company. The Zune is less than 35 days old. I would never recommend buying anything from Justin's Electronics. I'm thinking that I paid $200 for a refurbished product. You live and you learn. I will never buy another electronic off the internet.Thanks for nothing and taking my money!"
3,zune 30 gb,"Getting the zune from Amazon at the last minute worked great. The software with the zune wss the earliest possible version,6 other updates out there, so you had to update before you could do anything, but the updates were not available most of the time. You cannot update without freezing and resetting. My son loves his zune when he can get it to update."
2,worthless warranty,"One week after Christmas my teenage son broke the screen on his Zune, he really wasn't abusing it, but none the less it broke. My call to Microsoft's warranty center was very frustrating, the very polite gentleman who was clearly in a foreign country and spoke very poor english informed me that this type of problem is not covered by the warranty and the cost to repair was essentially the cost of a new Zune. He didn't have to see it, he didn't have to ask any questions it appeared he had a set answer for just about everything and the impression I got was no matter what the problem the warranty didn't cover it. I saw the way it broke and the screen on these is quite fragile so be very careful with it, Bill Gates can't afford to fix it."
3,Zune is cool but not quite an Ipod killer,"I got htis because I have already went thru 2 Ipods and was curious to what the Zune could do. IMO, it's similar to the ipod but a bit easier to navigate, the larger screen is nice as well as the FM tuner. It's sturdier and doesn't attract a lot of scratches which is a big plus.My only gripes are as follows:- No Mac support- Zune mktplace is a beast using the synch sometimes U have to go thru a few times to make sure the playlist saves correctly- No PODCAST SUPPORT...hopefully this will be fixedOne thing I DO like is that the software does a somewhat better job of organizing music than iTunes which really goes a long way finding music that I forgot I put on my pc.If you want something different...go for it, it's not a bad device by far but it needs some fine tuning and in about a year it could probably compete with the ipod."
5,Microsoft wins again,"The Zune is just like all your other MP3 players with radio and video, but it also has the benefit of Microsoft behind it. Think of what else has Microsoft behind it. Xbox, your computer, they all work with the Zune. I'm able to play the music and videos from my zune through my Xbox and onto my TV. Then there's also the wonderfull-ness of file sharing between Zunes. Yeah. Basically it's a good buy."
3,What's Up with the Price?,"I dont know what's going on with the price but, My advice is to wait untill the price drops, I got this exact same one from amazon brand knew 3 months ago for $99.00. So Watch out. Any way about the zune it's self it's decent. Like everyone else say's the software is horrendous. I absolutely hate it. The only reason I got this is because my Creative Zen broke from me dropping it. And It was the cheapest at 99 bucks. Also Check around for the new Zune's the 80 gigs one's on other sites are selling them for $249. So do shop around. That's all"
5,Replacement item,This was a replacement Zune for my husband he previously had one but dropped it and broke. I got this one instead of the hd because he is ruff on things and the hd is too fragile for him. I have the hd. We love Zune.
2,Zune 30 GB digital media player,"the item did not maintain a charge and, therefore, had to return the item - expect to get credit shortly"
1,Do not buy if you own a Media center pc,I purchased a Zune and was never able to use it because the zune softwarewill not work with media center 2004 or 2002.
1,Terrible software makes a decent player unusable. :(,"The zune is a decent product, almost as good as the iPod, in fact, and cheaper usually. Unfortunately, I've owned one and have found out that the software is so buggy, so inefficient, so difficult to use and counterintuitive, I can't actually use this decent MP3 player. I've sold it, and am MUCH happier with my Creative Zen.The software randomly deletes and syncs files for no apparent reason, skips albums, won't sync podcasts, and ONLY allows zune specific WMV's. (Try finding a lot of video files, trailers, etc in Zune format. It's difficult, at best.) I literally knew I couldn't keep wasting my time with this horrible an interface, so I sold it.2-3/10"
3,Good for what I paid,"Somehow I managed to catch one of these when the price was under $100. For that price, I think it's a great product. For the retail price, I'd probably buy something else. I had to wait a couple of weeks to get one at the special price, but it was worth if for the savings. You've probably seen these pros and cons before, but here's my take anyway.The good:Large, bright screen that orients pictures and videos horizontallySolid feel and rubberized back to prevent scratching (see IPOD)Large storage capacity and fast access to filesGood sound quality for an MP3 player, but of course, ear buds are cheapThe bad:No instructions in the box except to plug it in and turn it on.No included AC charger. Can't play while charging with USB cableCan't download music files purchased from Napster or RhapsodyNo gap-free play. Individual tracks that should seque have gapsWon't work with Windows Media, and Zune software is far inferiorNo true equalizer, just several preset options"
4,Great Experience,"Awesome, completely scratch proof (they dissapear), slightly bulky, don't like the wmv only video capability"
5,I am just wondering,How the heck is everyone writing reviews for a product that was just released today? Did amazon pre-ship these items? Or are all the reviews just apple/microsoft fanboy rants?
4,Zune has enough features to bite into Apple's pie,"Packing a 3"" screen, an FM-tuner, and Wireless features into a unit almost exactly the size of a video iPod, Zune is a compelling alternative to Apple's iconic iPod.While it's hard to match the elegance and innovation of iPod, Microsoft has broken new ground with its ""community"" features of Zune - which allow wireless sharing of songs from one Zune to any nearby Zune. The shared songs are limited to 3-plays-in-3-days.With its aggressive pricing, and feature-packed opening model, Microsoft may just turn the portable media player world into a two-horse race."
1,Instant Blue screen of death right here,"I installed the zune software, plugged in the zune when prompted, and the crap instantly hit the fan. Windows crashed, I couldnot restart the computer for the harddrives failed. I plugged them into my other pc to try and re assemble them and recover what data I could. Needless to say everything got instantly scrambled. I could not even retrieve Windows it's self! I lost All my files, games, my immaculate grade point avarage(I lost over 6 current large scale assgnments 3 of them due the very next day my excuse not accepted, i should have plugged the zune into her computer...) anyhooooooooo.... I was not too pleased with microsoft after that. Returned the zune and bought myself a brand new apple IPOD."
3,no custom eq setting,"I was very disappointed to find that my Zune only has preset eq settings. As a soundman i am appalled that a piece of music equipment comes without a custom eq,especially from Microsoft. Very Disappointed"
1,MY ZUNE IS DEAD!,"I PURCASHED A CHOCOLATE ZUNE FOR MY DAUGHTER. FIRST OFF I HAD ALOT OF TROUBLE LOADING THE OPERATING PROGRAM AT HOME AND SO LOADED IT AT WORK AND FOUND IT VERY HARD TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THE COMPUTER AFTER I WANTED TO TAKE IT OFF. I CHARGED THE ZUNE THROUGH THE USB CONNECTION. IT WORKED AT FIRST, BUT NOW THE UNIT IS DEAD. I THOUGHT THAT A WALL CHARGER WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT HASN'T. CURRENTLY I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE UNIT."
1,Problems Syncing and Updating Firmware,"Ok ... So this thing is about 2 weeks old and there's already a ""firmware update?"" Mine wouldn't finish updating after waiting 45 minutes. I loaded my whole music library in less time than that. Now every time I try to sync, it just hangs. Looks like I'll have to be doing a hard reset. Too bad ... it played pretty well the 1st couple of weeks. Maybe I'll find a place for it on craigs list or ebay."
4,Great Non Apple Mp3 player,"For the price its hard to beat. I considered purchasing an apple ipod classic and came across the zune price drops and figured it was too hard not to take a chance on the zune. As a father of two I purchased it out of practicality, including price and not media hype or coolness factor. I bought it mostly for music storage and pictures. My greatest concerns prior to purchasing were ease of use, functionality and battery life. My only disappointment is battery life. I average five hours which seems lousy to me. The zune requires its own software, similar to itunes with an upgrade that is pending. Right now the music or only availabe option on the zune marketplace is pretty good, but falls a bit short compared to itunes. However, its easy to use. The zune itself is easy to use and the screen is nice and pretty large. My only real disppointment is the current lack of videos for purchase on the zune marketplace and the short battery life."
1,Bought used---Big Mistake!,"This was a nightmare from the word go. It arrived scratched, gouged and loaded with stupid content which could not be deleted. The seller only agreed to refund my money after I filed a claim under the A-Z Guaruntee--then lied and said I had not returned the ear buds to stick me for an additional twenty bucks. Steer clear at all costs."
5,I love Zune!,I love Zune products! They have a long battery life. I would suggest Zune to anyone who would like to listen to their music and their easy to use as well as easy to download your music.
3,Zune software,"Outdated software, beware it is a pain to setup. You need to make sure you have the capability to put it in compatibility mode for Windows 7 and beyond."
1,Save your money,"This might be a good product if it had any instructions. I have never had an mp3 and needed a guide to help me along. You can't do anything (like delete a song) without hooking up to the software. The disc that came with it did not work and I had to download form the internet. I bought a ""Zune for Dummies"" book & it wasn't even the same software.I'm sending it back. It's not worth the headache.I'd give it zero stars if i could."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On Another Failed Microsoft Device,My Zune has been extremely unstable ever since I purchased it. It always had trouble syncing with my computer. Just today my computer no longer recognizes it. So I tried to reinstall the software several times with no fix. I have been doing some research on this problem and it turns out I am definitely one of many people having this problem. I am going to return this and exchange it for something else. I will not buy a zune again that is for sure.
3,Not so Easy to Use,Downloading isn't as easy as the IPOD but for the price I suppose the hassle is worth it
4,zune 30gb,i was really amazed at the things you can do with a zune player. it has been a great stisfaction for me to have purchased this productthank youdick in florida
2,holds you hostage just like the ipod,"The zune itself is great. Easiest interface i have ever used, great idea to include wireless zune to zune connection. The problem is that The bulk of my music came from yahoo music jukebox. Well the zune doesnt support that one type of specific file, so i am out of luck. I have a creative zen sleek, and i plan on getting the new creative zen. DEFINITELY SENDING THE ZUNE BACK.p.s. I cant even figure out how to get video onto the zune unless you buy it from the zune ""marketplace"". Whatever."
2,difficult to use,"My sister buy one. I play a while.still don't know how to use it.while I use ipod without any difficulty.Don't believe high rate of it in cnet,which just don't accept low rate and negative review on it."
2,Don't like the sharing feature,"The wireless sharing concept is good, and Apple needs to incorporate it into its iPod, but there are not enough Zune owners to make it work. Also, once you've shared a tune with someone, you can't share with that someone again. So, that makes it doubly bad. First, there aren't many Zune owners,and then, when you do find one, you can only share once. Microsoft needs to change that."
1,How can they...,"...in this day and age create a device so ugly??? I don't understand. I looks like it was made in the 70s. When you buy that kind of ""toy"", the kind you take with you everywhere and show to everyone, you can expect it to look nice. This is just awful! Brown??? Ew!Go figure!"
3,Cant use,"I just received this media player. When I tried to install the software to my computer, I found out that Zune does not support Windows XP Pro 64 bit systems (any xp 64 bit systems or window servers).Seems Microsoft does support the Windows Vista 64 systems. Its somewhat funny that Microsoft products is not supported by their own operating systems.Now I have to return the item which is a waste of time since I waited for deleivery, now have to re-ship the product and maybe get a refund with in the next 30 days, if I dont run into any problems with the seller."
5,"Great sound and durable,durable, durable.","With my job in a resturant my players are subjected to some extreme moisture and heat. This is the third zune i have had over the last four years and with what they go through i can only say WOW! My previous units had been dropped in liquids, dropped on hard flooring, and steamed of all things and still worked.While a year and a half life span average may not seem like much for what you pay for these units the conditions that they have gone through and still worked is amazing (yes i am a klutz).I have owned apple units and I dropped them once and they no longer work. I don't know if i have just had bad luck or not but so far the Zunes just keep going.Both the Zune and the I-pod have great sound.Also the Zune works with the Xbox 360( i use the xbox for everything from netflix to music.).If you are looking for an mp3 player that will keep working try the zune 30GB."
2,No manuals!,"I cannot believe that the Zune comes without a manual!I would like to use Windows media player to managee my Zune's content but instead I have to use a software that I do not like at all.I was hoping to move the music, pictures and videos from my computer using the Zune as an external drive.I find it very cumbersome!!!"
3,acceptable,"works fine, nothing really special.had only a 2 problems with itfirst it is not working like a regular memory stick soo if somebody else does not have the proper software then you won`t share anything zune to pc and pc to zune.second for some reason my waranty was already void on my zune when i had it registered with microsoft, after a couple hours on the phone with amazon and microsoft i had a problem fixed.oo ps.their customer support suck big timemy english is not as good as i wish, but they dont have any person that speaks acceptable english, except upper management."
2,I too wanted to like it.,"I received the Zune for a gift. I was very excited, the Zune has a larger screen, it is thicker and more durable than the ipod and it has the radio tuner. After spending 2 days trying to download the software and many many phone calls to their technical support (which by the way is less than helpful) I decided to return it and get the 30gb ipod that was set up in less than 1/2 an hour. I love my ipod however I wish that the Zune was a lot easier to use and transfer my Grey's Anatomy episodes on. Tech support told me that it really is developed for mainly music right now and eventually in the future their marketplace will offer movies and tv shows. Unfortunately by the time that happens there will probably be a newer version of the Zune and this one would be absolete."
4,Zune Rocks,"I don't understand why so many people are enslaved to the I-Pod. The Zune's touch command is so much easier to use than the circular scroll of the I-pod. Every I-pod owner that has used my Zune HAS confirmed that. With the Zune, I can wirelessly send music to a friend. I don't know if I-pod is doing that NOW, but I KNOW they weren't doing it 5 years ago when Zune began that concept. I can watch widescreen videos with excellent quality. Unlike the I-pod, if my computer is wiped clean I can pull all the music off and dump it onto a new computer. This essentially means also that I can set up Zune on multiple computers without having to start from scratch. While the I-pod is much more widely used, I feel like Apple intentionally holds back innovation so that they can sell a ""NEW"" version of it next year. Zune just puts it all out there right away."
1,"garbage,buy an i-pod","this player is extremely fragile.and certainly not worth anything more than 30 dollars.when something breaks and you do not know how it happened than the product was made very cheap.my screen is cracked and i lost almost 200 dollars on this item,it is extremely depressing.do not even try to buy this item. this was by far the worst experience i have ever had on amazon."
1,Piece of Junk,"The software didn't appear to load correctly, or give the prompt to connect the device. It's not compatable with Napster, or very few others that I can find. I couldn't even get it to take music from Windows Media Player. We could only get it to load a total of 4 pictures, which took forever. The only way we could get it to take music reliably is straight from a CD. Most of the time two different laptops wouldn't even reconize the device. If Micosoft is try to compete with Ipod they have lost. Basically the one we got was a piece of junk."
3,Zune can't be used as a portable harddrive.,"The Zune can not be used as a portable harddrive like the Apple iPod can. If Microsoft were to fix this via a firmware update then I would give the item four stars.However, lacking that feature is a real negative when you consider nearly all other players have it.Otherwise; I do enjoy the zune interface on the zune itself; it's fast and very clean and well organized. The zune software for the PC could use some work to make it more user friendly; but it is better than iTunes."
2,Just awful,"Sorry to be so negative out there...I truly love the blues and I love hip hop. I was excited to see this album and decided to give it a listen. Unfortunately, it takes the blandest aspects of these musical styles and brings them together into something that doesn't quite make it for me. The music loses it's soul and becomes a bunch empty drum machine beats. I think Mr. King is a very talented blues musician and should stick to his genre."
2,So much promise!,"Already being a big Chris Thomas King fan, I went out and bought this album out of principle. I really thought this would be the one that he pulled everything together, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite work out. The man has so much potential to bring blues and hip-hop together and introduce it to the world, but he falls just short every time of having a commercially viable record.Although I really respect how he covers all the bases himself (recording, producing, performing, etc.), I believe that his problem lies in not collaborating with a good producer. This record has alot of good ideas, they are just not sorted out like they would be by a talented producer.And for the first time while listening to any of CTK's music, I also felt alienated by the political, social, and racial overtones he has integrated into his songs."
2,Disappointing!!!!,"I am a huge fan of CTK but this CD is extremely disappointing. This kid is the future of the blues and with the exception of a few tracks, most notably ""Revelations"", this CD just left me wanting. If you are want to buy a CTK CD I would hold out until ""Rise"" is released and pick that up. The previews sound like he is going back to the old stuff and I will be sure to grab it with my fingers crossed."
5,I would hate to have missed this book!,"I love to cook and I love to read about cooking, all about it. I can't think of a cookbook I've read (and my cookbook collection is in the hundreds of volumes) that has been more interesting. Of course, I had more to learn about Indian cooking than about some others, but this book pulled me in as no other. The photography, artwork, sidebars, recipes themselves, information about the influences on the various regional cuisines, the herbs and spices, all were absolutely intriguing. I think the choice of Julie Sahni as the author was inspired. Besides being so knowledgeable about Indian cooking, and a great writer, she is also aware of the Western palate, and the book is chock full of recipes that appeal to the Western palate, and I suppose most others as well. Thank you, Chuck Williams, for causing this book!"
4,buy this isht...,Two Words: Mos Def. Smooth butter beat that will age nicely. Great for the friday freestyle cipher One of the better tracks on Rawkus' sequel to Sound Bombing. I don't see where this gets compared to 'Tribe' - if anything it has some Group Home/Mob Deep flavor...
1,Mind-numbinhg,"Erudition and research rule here; the characters are wooden, the dialogue unconvincing, the plot unbelievable. Part travelogue (gee, look where the author has been and made notes), part a compendium of Mozartiana, this tome deadens the senses."
2,Disappointing,The premise of the book was intriguing. But the writing is so poor and the plotting so sloppy that I was sorely disappointed. Too bad the novel was not rewritten by Dan Brown before publication; read one of his instead and skip this.
1,"terrible quality of service, undisclosed termination fee","I bought the phone/router combination in June 2006 from Compusa. The purchase included several rebates and opening of Vonage Service. CompUsa did not disclose termination fee of $39.99 that Vonage applies to terminations within first 12 months. Most VOIP providers do not require any termination fees for retail equipment/service purchases only for direct purchases.Quality of service was terrible, as a matter of fact the service is down now as I'm writing this. They try to keep you as long as possible to show high number of subscribers since they went public recently.But with this quality/cost ratio, the'll not survive. You can get Skype or other cheap VOIP services with better quality."
2,I wanted it to work so badly!!! I guess you need a T1 Line..,"I've had the vonage unlimited voice service and 12 virtual numbers for five months and we're on the verge of breaking up. On the outset, I thought VOIP would save me big bucks from $375-400 a month to $100...but I wasn't ever able to get the rock solid stability I need in a telephone line from the vonage line. My calls were always choppy and would echo even when forwarded to my cell phone...there seems to be a built in split second latency that is not present in regular land lines...I know that it's not all Vonage's fault, but my cable modem is faster and more reliable than anyone else's I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot) which made me confident at the outset that I had a chance of getting it to work. The service has a lot to offer if you can get it to work. Maybe if I had a T-1 line it would be perfect, but for now I have to stick with my phone company provided remote call forwarding lines."
1,An absolutely criminal company,"Stay away from anything Vonage. It's a corrupt organization of liars and thieves. 1.9 million google hits on the search ""Vonage sucks"" can't be all wrong."
2,Not good if you want to keep your current number,"Although the service may be great, here are two important things to keep in mind:* NO 911 SERVICE - Vonage does not provide 911 service or other automatic emergency numbers.* If you have DSL connected to your current line, you will have to keep your old local number plus pay for a new Vonage number.Make sure you know what you're getting into before you get this service."
3,Service = Cool -- Customer Service = junk,"I love the Vonage service, and the fact that I don't have to deal with Verizon at all. The outbound calling always works fine for me, love retrieving voicemails on the web, have taken it on the road with success.However, I do occasionally have problems where incoming calls are shunted to voicemail without my phone ringing, and I have been trying for weeks to get help from them.As a former dot-commer, I'm sympathetic to what a rapid explosion in business can do to overwhelm your customer support base, but, before this service is good for the non-""early adopter"" crowd, they need to get the service issues in check."
1,Negative 50 Stars is more like it.,"Vonage has absolutely the WORST service in the universe. Do NOT even think about trying to work with this company. They make promises and don't keep them. After waiting over FIVE MONTHS for them to port a number, and many calls and emails, they failed miserably.I got email after email from Sanjeeb, Vishna, Abhay, Ramesh, Navin, etc. You get the picture. They never respond personally and you can never deal with the same person twice. It is just horrible.It cost me a lot of money for the knowledge I'm sharing with you. Don't use Vonage!"
1,Stay away from Vonage!,"Stay away from Vonage! After more than 1 month, still don't have phone number transferred. Can't get thru to customer service...very long wait. Paying 2 phone bills...so much for saving cost and so-called service. Called to cancel service, and customer service rep promised to put account/billing on hold until phone number transfer is done...finally something positive from customer service department!"
2,Beware of following things before you jump in..,"First - let me tell you it is a great service, if you can live with the following:1. You need to keep Cable / DSL modem, a router and a Vonage equipment (ATA) always ON.. so count on some electricity bill.2. When you call someone, the receipient's caller ID will show ""Unkown"".3. You will not be listed in Phone Book / 411.4. NO 911 service.5. You always need electricity and your internet connection should always be working.6. If you have only 128 kbps DSL connection, then while talking on Vonage phone, you are left with only 128-90 = 38 kbps connection for web surfing.. so you cannot do both at the same time.7. THERE IS A DISCONNECT FEE OF 39.99 WHENEVER YOU DISCONNECT THIS PHONE SERVICE."
1,Don't expect to get your number transferred,"After 2 months, 2 unintelligble e-mails from Vonage representatives with no contact information or way to respond, and 15 calls and more than 10 hours of phone (or hold) time with Vonage Customer Service, our cell number has still not been ported to Vonage (meaning that our Vonage phone only works for outgoing, not incoming calls). Even worse, the Vonage customer care keeps no log of prior requests or transactions, and even when they do open ticket numbers, they take no action to resolve those tickets (one ticket has been open for more than a month with no action taken). If you plan on purchasing Vonage, please be prepared for a very bumpy ride, with multiple frustrations and customer non-service calls along the way."
4,the only one,the only book about the relations of the two men . yes churchill helped the gaulle withhis movement but he nevertheless wanted to dump him a couple of times . churchill needed the help of roosevelt very much in ww2. and the president hated de gaulle .. so complicated matters arose..
1,"If you want to pass, get a different book.","The people who wrote this book would like you to believe that this is the only text you will need to pass 70-64.You can try, but I'll bet if you memorized this book cover to cover, you would still fail.This book, in my opinion, omits a lot of information that you need for the test. And I mean a lot of information. I would highly suggest getting a copy of the Windows 95 Resource Guide and using Exam Cram or the Sybex Windows 95 Study Guide. The Exam Cram is good if you have a good working knowledge of Windows 95 already.In any case, I just wanted to let people know that I dropped $50 on this book and if this was the only book I used, I would have failed the test. It is confusing and poorly written.If you don't believe me, check out some MCSE web sites on the web and read for yourself. I can't speak for all the New Riders books for MCSE, but this one stunk.E. Detwiler"
5,"great book, great man",Anderson cooper is a great resource and this is a great book. I couldn't put it down...
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed reading this book once I got into it, but it took a little bit of time. He tended to jump around quite a bit which made a little more difficult to follow, but once I got into it, I found his stories interesting. I fully expect to see another book by Mr. Cooper a few years down the road talking about how regretful he might be for being such a workaholic. Facinating life, but it certainly would not be for me. I would much prefer to enjoy COMPLETE vacations with friends or family to ALWAYS working."
4,Intriguing but wanted more,"I really enjoyed how Anderson Cooper wrote this book. He weave stories of somalia and katrina along with personal reflections from his life like the deaths of his brother and father. If you are looking for a tell all of any dirt that may be in Coopers closet, you are going to be disappointed. If you want a thoughtful read on what it is like to be on the front line as a reporter - you will be thrilled.I have always been a big fan of Cooper so I was a tad disappointed this didn't reveal more about the younger Cooper but I still enjoyed this read completing it in only a few days."
2,Dispatches dull and boring,"As much as I like Anderson Cooper as a correspondent, his book was quite difficult to plod through - dull and boring."
3,Nothing to Write Home About,"A fast read with a choppy style that makes the locales and story a little challenging. Anderson Cooper becomes known to the reader as a cross between 5th Ave New York with roots also in small town Mississippi. Any reader will admire how Anderson broke into the news business. No helping hands or using connections, just flying off to some of the world's hot spots, shooting footage and selling it to the major networks. It was a pretty dismal plan at first, actually being let off in a desert airstrip in North Africa, with no one in sight where he remained until offered a ride by a local warlords taxi service.I would have preferred the book without the flashbacks and choppy style, and there were not any eye-opening revelations in the book, it was an OK book that will appeal to people who are Anderson Cooper fans"
3,lloyd baby lloyd,"this is actually just a recording of charles lloyd's quartet from '68 in which Jarrett played at the time, not some Jarrett's project. Jarrett has more sex appeal, I guess, and the MAN thought it would sell better like this. the recording features the great Jack DeJohnette on drums and ron mclure on bass (and of course lloyd and jarrett). the songs they play are all by Lloyd: love ship, tagore, passin'thru, and forest flower. the quality of this dvd is really bad and it's short (about 30 min) but I still recommend it, because they playing is awesome. jarrett also plays soprano sax and does some pretty amazing things with his piano. all dejohnette fans should see this."
4,"feel good, funky music!","This is a great CD...not to mention i couldn't help but buy it after seeing Christine perform. if you ever get a chance to do so, go! her baton act is awesome. this CD is full of clever lyrics and good memories! ""they look alike, they walk alike..."" never fails to make me smile!"
3,Size does matter . . .,I was a little disappointed in the size. They are so small that you cannot even tell what they are when you are wearing them. I wish I would have paid more attention to the detailed description.
3,What happened to the Dave Matthews Band song?,"I ended up watching this concert on television (I did not feel there were too many highlights) and patiently waited for DMB to play. They did not play with Nelson as expected but turned in what I believed was the performance of the night with a taped song from a previous concert ( I think I heard Dave had throat problems and was forced to cancel ). ""Ain't It Funny How Time Slips Away"" deserved to be on that album just as much as some of the other songs. It had been listed as a track before the album was officially released but the plans were scrapped."
1,Two Thumbs Down!!,"I agree with the A reader from New England. This book is a HUGE disappointment. It's mean-spirited, self-serving, emotionally dead, a Joyce Carol Oates novel without color, humor, insight or compassion. Definitely Sally Jesse Raphael material & no more. Blecchhh!!!"
3,"hey, she can write whatever she wants.","I don't have a problem with Maynard talking about Salinger -- it was her life, too, and she's entitled to chronicle that. After I finished this book, I felt profoundly sorry for Joyce Maynard. Her parents screwed her up royally, and she never has had the introspective qualities needed to transcend it. I give her credit for saying that she is a ""journeyman"" -- no one ever claimed she was a genius, so why are so many people dumping on her, anyway?"
2,One BAD Birthday Gift..................................,"A well-meaning (presumably) friend presented this book to me on my birthday. Why, I am not entirely certain, except that the author and I are of the same general age, and I do like autobiographies and nonfiction, as a rule.BUT....... This was one dreadful read. I confess to not having made it through the entire book, but I gave it my best try. I swear I did. In my opinion, Ms. Maynard's writing style is annoying as all get out: flat, uninteresting, one-dimensional. It is hard to believe she makes her living as a writer, although in all honesty, I haven't read anything else she has written.This seems to be a book written as a vendetta of some kind. Mainly against Salinger, but also against everyone else who has also ""wronged"" Ms. Maynard (and there are MANY!). I didn't enjoy it very much at all."
3,Oh My,"Ever notice how reviewers at Amazon dot Com give books one or five stars? This book was neither great nor awful. If you enjoy Oprah-like confessionals where an author stares into her navel you might appreciate it more than I did. If you require authors to have led interesting lives before writing memoirs you might find it a crushing bore. Who cares about the salacious details about Salinger? Anyone who doesn't know that great artists can be horrible, boring, neurotic, overbearing, etc., should get over his or her hero worship. Putting such figures on a pedestal is inane but singling them out for special contempt is insipid. She was over 18, hence responsible for her share of what happened. If the author had kept his name anonymous I suspect she could have portrayed the relationship with greater authenticity. But that book, I suspect, wouldn't get much attention."
1,DON'T WASTE MONEY ON THIS BOOK,"If you have an IQ above room temperature or any idea in your head that people are somehow responsible for the state of their lives, don't read this book. In fact, if you like fine writing, or even adequate writing, don't bother with this book. The volume is a heaping helping of tears and middle-class angst that details the author's incredibly brief tenure as disposable sex object to a highly overrated writer, and the ramifications of this event in her later life. Maynard's existence climaxed during her affair with Salinger; everything else, like this book, is merely coasting after-the-fact."
1,Do not waste your money on it,"This is cheap made, air always leaks when you test, and soon the battery will be gone. Buy Viair 90056 instead, high quality, accurate number, no need battery."
1,Does not seal to tire stem... useless product.,"I bought this product for $10 in a Gold Box deal a few weeks back, and finally have had the opportunity to try it out... A waste of $10 unfortunately. I had read the other reviews that said this product was tough to seal on the tire stem, but I had a 100% failure... No seal was able to be made at all, it simply does not have enough leverage to depress the plunger in the stem and let the pressure hit the meter to be read. There doesn't seem to be enough room on the tip of this device to let it push in far enough, so I'm not even sure what modifications will make it work."
2,It came defective but I'll have to keep it!,"I bought this gauge when I moved in from Maine to Missouri. It was an 11th hour order, & was waiting for it to arrive at my GO date but, gladly it came. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to check for defects because I was running out of time for my trip. I just noticed that the display was fading, looks like it's running out of battery yet, the reading was still accurate. When I arrived, it took me some time (3 months) to check it again to buy it a new battery (energizer). Then later I noticed that there were no changes, the display was still fading & the flashlight doesn't work, sad to say It came defective. I wish I could return it but it's a little too late for that.Despite all the issues, the good news is it still reads accurately & doesn't need an O'ring because the tip was rubberized. I think I have the newer (defective) model. lol"
3,Digital Tire Gauge,"The tire gauge appears to be accurate, it's a little difficult to holdon the valve stim with out it leaking; needs to have a deeper receiver.It is easy to read the lighted numbers."
5,Accutire MS-4350B Tire Guage,This tire gauge does the job of telling you the tire pressure in your car's tires....and for a reasonable price. Do yourself a favor and keep one of these in your glove box and check your tire pressure once in a while. You'll get better gas mileage and save a few bucks.
3,Accurate gauge if you can get it seated,"I've owned an earlier model of the Accutire digital gauge bought from Costco about 5 yrs ago. The non-replaceable battery just died. It worked well if you can get it seated without letting a lot of air out of the tire. The new Accutire, even with the included gasket, is just as difficult for me to use, perhaps more so. Once seated, it does read the pressure accurately.I also bought the Accu-Gage EZ Air Check and Inflate Tires at the same time a few days ago. It is easily worth the extra cost given its ease of use and versatility. I reviewed it on its product page and recommend it even at the higher price over the Accutire digital."
3,Recommended with reservations,"This tire gauge is not always easy to use because you have to be pretty exact when pressing in. If you're off or tilted a little bit, it just lets air out of your tire. There are some useless functions on it, like recording what your tire pressure should be... one can just remember or look on the inner door panel.Overall, I would only recommend it for casual users because works and who wants to spend that much time shopping around for a tire gauge?"
1,Doesn't work....,Not a fan at all. Simply does not give you an accurate reading. Seems to be consistently incorrect if that helps. I would avoid this product.Good luck....
2,"Accurate, but does NOT seal properly to valve stem","Like many of the other reviews I've read, this tire gauge does not seal properly to the tire's valve stem. And I've tried this gauge on 3-4 different cars. If you don't fit it exactly (and I MEAN EXACTLY) centered on the valve stem, you lose a few PSI just trying to insert the gauge. So if you miss the stem a couple of times, you lose 5 PSI right off the bat. And this happens to me 9 times out of 10 (keep in mind that I'm not a clumsy person).Back-lit LCD screen is nice when using at night. It also stores your car's factory-recommended tire pressure, but that's not difficult for me to remember. The gauge does seem accurate though, so there's no problem there. But it just has a flawed design. Go with theAccutire MS-4021B. Not perfect, but a lot easier to align with your tire's valve stem."
3,Unreliable,"The battery dies pretty quickly, so when you need it it's not working. So I always have to carry a passive gauge as well. It's more accurate than one of those, but less reliable.It doesn't work reliably, either. It doesn't make a good seal or doesn't press the valve stem, and is frustrating to use."
1,Measured a Half-Dozen Times Then Stopped Working,"Used just a few times over a one-year period. Kept in glove box and never dropped or mistreated. Took out last week and the display would not come on. Never gets below 40 deg F here so not a cold issue. Bought new button batteries and still does not work. Given the large number of complaints, this appears to be poorly designed and unreliable."
4,So far so good,The unit feels pretty sturdy in your hand. The rubber grip is comfortable and the screen is legible. The LED light is convenient and works well when its dark out. My only complaint is that it can be hard forming a good seal with the valve stem. Overall good product though. I hope it lasts.
1,No support on warranty,I bought two of these and they worked for about two years. The batteries went dead in both so I returned them as the warranty instructed. The UPS tracking said they arrived but I never received any guages back and this has been over three months. So consider them a disposable and don't waste money on a return.
3,works but does not sit on valve easily,The product works and the light is outstanding to use at night but it must be seated exactly right or air blows out of the tire while you fiddle with the positioning. Most conventional gauges have large bushing type seats for the gauge to align to the valve and this one is nearly flat so any angle and it does not read but leaks air.
3,Seems nice,"Have this tire gague, but haven't used it yet so I don't know how well it works. The set up was very easy,nice display screen,and it's light weight. I'll post another review when I actually use it."
1,complete failure,"I left it in the car for a few months. Completely dead. Batteries are still charged, so I'll just throw this device out. Not recommended."
4,Pressure Check,This product is very handy. The product would make a good gift for somebody or keep it for yourself.
5,Excellent Tire Gauge!,"I was looking for a digital tire gauge, I found the reviews on this one good, It is made of plastic but it feels high quality, the screen has big numbers, and is back-lit, it has a rubber grip for your hand, it also has a led light for taking measures at night, I'm glad a got it, highly recommend it!"
2,Pressure Gauge,"This was a very easy to use device. I checked the tire pressure with it and then with a gauge that was not digital and they had the exact same reading. Then, this gauge started not reading tire pressure anymore. I had only owned it for a month before it broke. Don't waste your money on this product. Hopefully, technology like this will get better over time."
1,"Poor design: leaks air, short battery life","This is junk. I purchased the Bell Automotive version of this gauge with the Monkey Grip label from a Kragan Auto Parts about 2 months ago and used it with two cars. It is very difficult to take a reading without leaking air; it takes multiple attempts per tire to establish a tight seal for a reading, loosing air each time. The batteries died after 2 months of light use. Ambiguous low battery indication. Display shows ""Lo"" during a reading attempt. It's not explained in the manual. Does it mean low pressure, a problem taking pressure reading, low battery? Determined it means low battery. Returned it back to Kragan's and switched to a Topeak SmartGuage, which works great on the same cars; no leaks."
5,A Great Reissue,"Apart from Skyclad, Primordial must be the only folk/pagan metal band I truly listen to. In my opinion they are the only currently relevant group in this much maligned subgenre that manages to fully integrate ethnic/folk music influences without resorting to gimmicky instrumentations while keeping their metal interesting. Aside from the unquestionable quality of the music contained, this reissue of Primordial's pivotal second album is a true labour of love: the songs sound crisp and lively, the packaging is top notch and the extras (including a bonus disc with a great live performance) make this an indispensable purchase for any black/viking/folk/pagan metal fan and truly worthwile for any open minded headbanger."
1,Patricia Cornwell Lied,"Not only is this book not wonderful, it's not fascinating, original or delightfully readable. The book is poorly written and contains too many inane anecdotes and not nearly enough useful information. Don't waste your time, or money."
2,THREE Major SHORTCOMINGS,"THREE things turned me off & resulted in me buying a COMPETITORS PRODUCT:1. Water isn't pumped up to the TOP of the filter like COMPETITOR PRODUCTS. Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180 each time they fill the jug. This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.2. The CONSENSUS of reviewers was UNFAVORABLE in terms of CUSTOMER SERVICE & PARTS3. HOT AIR is on the ceiling & cooler air is on the floor. This unit blows air HORIZONTALLY, instead of vertically. COMPETITOR PRODUCTS blow the air vertically."
2,Too big and gets room cold,"This product is big and ugly, takes a lot of space and the filter is expensive. The room gets cold when its on."
4,Not ideal for the nursery...but still good,"The fan is quiet enough and it does produce a good amount of moisture, however, the fan does move a lot of air around. During the winter time (when this is most likely used) it creates drafty conditions that make it impratical for a newborn's nursery room. This replaced an older warm-mist unit, and frankly, I should have purchased a warm-mist for the nursery instead of this."
2,Whole lot of shaking going on,"I understand that no product will generally have great reviews from everyone, so before buying I looked over reviews and thought, well, overall this should be ""okay"". NOT. It was extremely noisy, mostly due to the fact that the storage wells wobbled. There was just no way to keep them from vibrating. Perhaps, if there had not been wheels on the base part of the humidifier,it would have been stabilized, but I was not about to start messing with that part. In the end we bought one from Sears and have been very happy with it."
4,It works,"First I went cheap and bought a small evaporative unit. The large filter was ""permanent"", but required occasional decaling and the small pump filter kept getting gummed up. I then purchased a warm mist unit, it worked at first and when required continuous use to barely maintain the proper humidity level. After got my electric bill, I stopped using it. Finally I purchased this unit. Works perfectly, keeps the house at the level I want (45%) and only automatically turn on when needed. The dual water tanks are also nice. I suggest you get a unit rated to at least double your home's square footage."
3,"A little loud, but gets the job done.","On our hardwood floors, this humidifier runs a little loudly even on low. We've had to get a rug to place under it to reduce the vibrations. However, it does put out a lot of humidity and keeps a medium sized room very comfortable."
2,HERMAN'S REVENGE,"CHIEF WILLIAMS POINTS OUT ONLY THE NEGATIVE IN A FINE ORGANIZATION. HE SPENDS DOZENS OF PAGES TELLING US HOW TERRIBLEHIS LIFE WAS AND HOW MISTREATED HE WAS. LIFE WAS HARD, BUT NOT JUST FOR HERMAN WILLIAMS. CHECK WITH ANY ROOKIE FIREFIGHTER IN ANY DEPARTMENT. I ACTUALLY ADMIRED THE MAN UNTIL I READ THIS BOOK. HERMAN IS AS MUCH A RACIST AS ANY HE ENCOUNTERED. CHIEF HERMAN WILLIAMS GOT THE LAST LAUGH. HE WILL STAND IN THE ANNUALS OF BALTIMORE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT HISTORY AS THE CHIEF THAT CLOSED THE MOST FIRE STATIONS AND DISBANDED THE MOST FIRE COMPANIES. HERMAN MADE CHIEF AND GOT HIS REVENGE."
4,GREAT READ FOR THOSE FLAT DAYS,A whole bunch of short stories from surfers around the world. Some sad. Some funny. Some very in-ya-face. But all a good read. Keep it in the glovebox of your car to read when you're sitting on the sand waiting for the swell to arrive.
5,One of the best modern series.,Ever since the first episode of this show I've been hooked. I could only compare it to the first seasons of Lost (before Lost went down the drain with its crazy). I highly recommend it!
1,I'm not buying this......,"Once again, those of us who already own Part One, Season One of a TV show are forced to buy a whole season if we also want Part Two. I'm supposed to pay $42 for a few episodes after part one? I don't think so. ABC canceled this show without a series resolution (unlike 'Lost') anyway, so unless you like to be left hanging you may consider not buying this either."
5,Best Show of 2009-2010,"I went into the 2009-2010 season watching some older shows and some new shows. Among the older shows were shows like The Office, 30 Rock, and Lost(although it sadly got cancelled this season). Among the new shows, I was watching Sons of Tucson and FlashForward. Both of those shows were cancelled. Although I did watch and enjoy Sons of Tucson, I watched FlashForward religiously. I would make time on Thursdays to watch the new episodes. The show was like a puzzle with all of the pieces coming together at the end of the series, and that was a really great way to keep people coming back. Also, the show looked spectacular in 1080i on my 26"" HDTV. So, I will inevitably buy this DVD, and maybe like Family Guy was renewed through DVD sales after being cancelled, FlashForward will be as well."
2,DON'T BUY THIS,"This was a wonderful series that was not continued, so you will get hooked and then be disappointed because you will never know what happened and how the story ends."
2,Advertised as Very Good Conditon & WAS NOT!,"""Ok not only was the VHS Movie advertise a movie as being in VERY GOOD condition when selling it....YES I know its Prev. Used but AT LEAST have the respect to REWIND the MOVIE! I got the movie & it clearly shows it was watched & NEVER rewound. "" ALSO for paying almost $23.00 for this tape as again ""VERY GOOD"" condition, I found the sound quality to be BAD & some lines throughout the movie....I would NOT have labled this movie ""MAD ABOUT MAMBO"" as Very Good Condition & would NEVER have PAID that price for the quality I did get!"
3,Failure,I just want all the people out there who people out there who are going to buy this product inseadt of th microsoft are making a grave mistake. When i got this chareger by mail. I was excited when i recieved it but soon realized that only one battery pack worked.
3,Hmmm..,We have yet to use this product!!! BOOO!! Due to the fact that our system & remote controls that we purchased are newer than this specific charge station and charge packs. So we have to now wait on the company to send us back new ones. Xbox has way tooo many problems!!! What a shame.
1,Product does not work,Just bought this product and it will not charge the batteries. Seems like a good deal but you will end up having to return this item.
3,its ok,"It charges my battery packs, ive experienced some problems with it thou e.g on long nights of gamage using two controllers as quick as you put it to charge it says its done and when u plug it back in the 360 controller its like half charged and dies quickly but i realised that this problem was solved by cleaning the heads of the charge station, and i didnt experience this problem again"
3,Not as good as her others,"I read my first Tamar Myers' book several years ago and bought the rest of her books the next weekend. Within two weeks, I had devoured all her books and developed a taste for female mystery writers. Her last few books in both her series have been disappointing, and this one was no exception. I finished the book in two nights but felt hollow - stuffy not fluffy. (I love the crepes recipes, though).Now that Susannah is married, Magdalena is not quite so pithy as before; Gabe is not as interesting as ""Pookie Bear"" (whom I still miss); and Freni is not as colorful. I really feel that Magdalena carrying ""Little Freni"" in her bra is a mistake. When Susannah did it with her rat/dog, it was quirky and fun; when Magdalena does it (after complaining about Susannah's habit), it seems contrived.Don't get me wrong. I would still recommend the book as highly entertaining, but if you don't like this one, try one of her other books first."
1,This crepe has gone stale.,"I read this book out of curiosity and found it a little too crude for my taste. Both Kinsey Millhone and Spenser have probable cause for making glib, and sometimes crude, wisecracks. Magdalena Yoder doesn't. If anything, she may be in need of a good psychologist. And cats no doubt make fine pets but there has got to be something wrong with the way this broad carrys her's around. I probably won't be reading the rest of the books in this series any time soon."
1,ick!,"just not that into this scrub. i do love a good grainy scrub, so that it's made from almond meal wasn't a deterrent, but but there's nothing remarkable about this product. it doesn't spread at all, it just rolls out of your palms and off your face."
3,An Effective Repulic Western,"A former Texas lawman (the stern William ""Wild Bill"" Elliott) searches for his brother's killer on a trail drive.This Republic Pictures play on RED RIVER is effective due to strong performances by an excellent cast, including Walter Brennan, Marie Blanchard and Harry Morgan.Elliott was a popular Republic star during the 1940s. Unlike other Republic players (whose vehicles were aimed squarely at an adolescent audience), his characterizations were unusually mature, with vengeance often their motivating factors. If you are familiar with Elliott, this will provide a fond reminder of this nearly forgotten star."
1,Garbage,"The most interesting thing about Bernhard Lang is how hard he tries to impress us with nonsense. One imagines he spent considerably more time thinking up the ""avant-garde"" sounding titles than about the ""music"" itself."
4,Country,I love Flatts! Great songs to sing too! Easy to remember and even my daughter loves them! It's good to be able to listen to something you and your child likes!
5,Fantastic Pourer / Stopper,"This is not only a good stopper, but it's a fantastic pourer. This is our third one (unfortunately, we keep losing one of the pieces). No dripping with this pourer."
1,Did not even last a day of use.,"While they look good and seem functional, the issue is the rubber that is supposed to fit snug in the bottle to stop it up, doesn't stay in place and rides up the shaft of the device. It then splits and cracks and won't even stay in the bottle. I had high hopes for these, but was disappointed."
4,Great for traveling,I purchased this stopper while traveling to seal an open bottle of wine and take it with me. Worked fabuously and traveled 600 miles with the bottle on its side and did not spill a drop.
3,Poor quality,"I liked it at 1st. However the rubber that attach to the bottle got loose, causing it to slide up when i insert it into the bottle neck. It can be glued back, but still.. poorly manufactured as it occurred on the second time of putting it in a bottle. Dissapointing."
5,pleased,It is easy to store and save opened bottles of wine. It makes it easy to pour as well and not spill any.
1,Kill me,"Firstly, the information in this book is just plain offensive. Truely. It is the most incorrectly marketed information I have seen about this subject thus far. The only reason I would give one star would be for the design of the actual book."
5,"Fun mystery, sweet romance!","This is a fun story that follows not only the budding romance between the hero and heroine but an intriguing mystery as well. The interaction between the two main characters was realistic and never reached levels of silliness or contrivance. Their conflict was solid, and it was great to watch the barriers erode slowly through the book. I do hope Myles's story will be next! You'll really enjoy this one!"
5,nice item,"nice brush of high quality material, nice design, new model. product brand name is famous n reliable. recommended, for good price..."
4,A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORK....AS ALWAYS,"Every Jaguares album has been different and this is not the exception. As always, Saul is writing with his soul, giving us messages of an espiritual way of life. Musically, it needs more energy in some of the songs. But in general is a very good job. BUY IT, LISTEN AND PRACTICE THE MESSAGE..."
2,Que pasa con Daniel....creo que es un juevo,Estoy pensando en todo que pasa en la vida de nuestro amigo senor Daniel Pebozo (tambien se llama Pebonr). Pebonr quiere musica como este poo poo porque esta en el medio de la vida y tiene problemas con esa. Pebonr necesita compra musica mas mejor de este como neo progressive. Eres un gran juevo Pebozo.
4,Amusing story with great music.,"I have the video and would love for it to be released on DVD. It's mildly entertaining with some great musical features. Lesley-Anne Down is very good as the virginal wife of an older man. The interwoven relationships of the characters presents an amusing (if somewhat disturbing) situation when mismatched lovers find themselves vacationing together in the country. Even if the story doesn't keep you interested, the musical score should."
4,Liz and Diana superb in a not-so-cinematic film version,"I am reviewing this on the basis of having seen the film in the theater and I now own the laser version. Someone like Ingmar Bergman would have made it more cinematic but it is worth having because of Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg. I think Elizabeth is a perfect Desiree and Rigg is ideal. Had the film been a commercial success she might have received an Oscar nomination. Several songs are cut including the chorus' comments throughout but I still find it fun.""A Weekend in the Country"" is perfectly done and one wishes Hal Prince had directed the whole movie that well. And to date it is the only Sondheim show to be filmed. I hope it comes back on DVD with scenes that were left out.. There is a still of Diana Rigg smoking a cigar that did not make it in the movie."
2,An unfortunate mess,"When the camera tracks for a full minute just to get to the double doors for Taylor's entrance, you know you're in for a slow. plodding time. Prince proved he may be a genius on the stage but is pretty clueless when it comes to movies; he took what was essentially bullet-proof material and made it dull. Poor Sondheim -- this is almost as appalling as the film version of FORUM."
2,Too Little Elizabeth Taylor,"I always loved the play/movie. Still, it seemed a little long watching it at home. Guests fell asleep."
4,A nice follow up....,"I saw David Gray live in Burlington,Vt in 2001 and he was amazing. His White ladder album was flawless and i thought that his next album would be just as powerful.....well, A new day at midnight is an excellent album with more of a soft rock appeal than his past albums. Gray's finest work can be found in his past albums such as Ep's, white ladder etc....Gray's lyrics still remain powerful and productive as you get a mental image of both contrast and example :) good album, but it isn;t white ladder!"
4,David Gray,"I love listening to this CD. When I am listening to this CD, people walking by always ask me who the artist is because the music sounds great. It's a good CD to own."
3,Decent,"This album is very good but I am a David Grayophile and I think this is weaker than White Ladder, which had musical themes it played through from beginning to end. This album is more uneven."
2,Picture layout changes from screen to printer,"I attempted to lay out several pictures for each monthly calendar. The layout changed from what was on my screen to what would actually print out. I experienced quality degradation of my photos that I couldn't fix. The background color had to be the same for every month. It was very challenging to figure out how to make the program produce a calendar where each month fit over two pages, pictures on the top page, calendar dates on the bottom page, in landscape mode (so that it could be comb bound in the middle). I finally gave up using this program for the photo part of the calendar. I printed the pictures using Adobe Photoshop, the calendar using this program, and took it to a color printing shop for duplication."
1,Calender creator,The product would not load on desktop or laptop. Contacted vender and their response was what the symptems were. I replyed and no further response from the vender. Contacted vender again to request a refund or replacement. No rsponse.Calendar Creator 12 Deluxe By Broderbund
1,didn't seem to last all that long,"brought two 4-packs of these on vacation, had them run out on me faster than it seemed they should. do not seem better than energizer nor duracell. I bought some lithium energizers to use for my next trip. I was using them in a canon digital camera which works with normal alk batteries. bought these as a ""get to $25"" fill in purchase at amazon."
4,Pretty good,Pretty good story and acting by Woody. Brought reality to what this type of soldier goes through everyday. Would recommend this movie.
4,prompt service,"I ordered this product and received it promptly, the only problem I have is that it skips about 3/4 of the way through. I didn't want to send it back and wait for a new one. I would order again from this seller."
3,A Day in the Heart of Mexico,"Hallock's amiable tale of suspense takes the reader behind the scenes at a guest house deep in the heart of Mexico. The plot is somewhat transparent, and the references to the protagonist's dead husband are overdone, but the novel does give a sense of life in Oaxaca. These daily life depictions are the strongest parts of the book. The novel might be of more interest to older readers or readers with a special interest in Spanish and/or Mexico."
4,"Pretty good, but not great","As one reviewer pointed out, he should have focused on each man seperatly! It was hard to remember who was who. It is still an interesting read though. Try Masters of Enterprise. It is a more thorough look at most of the same men, and also has some different entrepreneurs like Mary Kay (yes, the cosmetics Mary Kay.)"
3,From 1982?,"While informative and useful, please note production must have been in the mid 1980's or so. Video quality seems to be converted from a VHS tape with lines across the screen at times."
1,Promising but disappointing.,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Ball's previous title, Slaves in the Family, I was looking forward to this book. The work has an intriguing topic, that is, the history of one elite African-American family in Charleston. Unfortunately, the narrative and context are too selective and the history is thin, relying too heavily on family documents and stories. Slaves in the Family was enhanced by the personal tone; here it is distracting and feels amateurish. When Ball does branch out to into other directions, the stories and descriptions feel more like padding than relevant material."
1,WRONG!,I order the what I thought was a little brown bear on a metal key chain. What I received was a panda with a cheap plastic clip.
5,Garfield's Pooky--Absolutely Adorable!,"I ordered this Ty Beanie Baby and received it very quickly. It was well-packaged and looked perfect. I will treasure Pooky, because he is a beloved character in the Garfield comics I love so much, as well as a personal reminder of someone very dear to me. Very satisfied with seller!"
5,How to Get Started and Loads More,"This book is great for anyone who has never used any kind of webdesign software. It has great pictures and cool hints for doing stuff. The text is clear and easy to read and the book introduces all the important parts of both bits of software. Once you have used this, you will feel confident to learn and do more than you thought you could. It might not make you an expert, but will be a great starting point for anyone taking the plunge"
2,Nice Pics .... but that's about it.,This book is severely lacking. The book uses a lot of pictures and poor descriptions in an attempt to teach you how to use dreamweaver functions. The result is that you get an idea of how to do certain functions but never get the feeling of how to effectively put them together. The book is in limbo between catering to beginners and being a mere reference book for someone trying to remember 'how to create an input form'. Had this book provided a simple web project that the readers could complete while teaching us the program; then everyone (readers and author) might have been able to stay on the 'same page'.
1,Caveat emptor,"There's no denying that Taylor is a very good writer of short stories, but this selection will not do, for the serious reader, scholar, or intrigued novice. There is no documentation whatsoever! One does not know, for example, when these stories were written, where they were first published, who made the selection and on what basis. The last complaint is made even more egregious by the misleading title: this book does not ""collect"" all of Taylor's stories. Certainly, a preface or introduction would have been helpful. And what's with the photo of a southern plantation on the cover? These stories are set in a post-bellum, mostly urban South. Peter Taylor deserves better than this shoddy, sloppy presentation. So do his readers."
5,Great Kettle!,"This is an amazing kettle for the price. I assume the other reviewers got faulty ones. The one I got shuts off after the water boils. As mentioned before, it's not good for one or two cups of water. But if you want one for that, you should'nt have bought this one. For small quanities buy Bodum's Ibis Mini. Either way, this one is the better deal.It boils the water in about 2-4 minutes. I think this product is great, I recommend it highly. The only thing I don't like is that it isn't very attractive. Which doesn't really matter too much, b/c it sits in the corner of my counter.Fully functional!!"
3,Didn't ship or hold up well.,"I'm a coffee drinker, but use instant rather than brewing my own. I decided to try a kettle rather than replacing coffee makers so often. When I received it, the plastic knobs to hold the filter in place had broken off. I managed to get the lid to hold the filter when closed. It worked fine for a few weeks, then stopped heating. I used to have the same problem with coffee makers, but at least they were cheaper, so I guess I'll go back to them if I'm going to have to buy replacements every couple of months. The old percolators worked for years for me, but they are priced way out of my range these days. Maybe I'll try another brand of kettle next. Having to use the microwave every time I need hot water is too much aggravation."
3,Black kettle,"We find the kettle goes on boiling too long before turning itself off, it causes a lot of steam so we have to pull away from the cabinet above and turn it off ourselves."
2,Automatic shutoff - not!,"I purchased this kettle for our office, and quickly found that it does not automatically shut off and stay off after the water is hot, contrary to the product description. Instead, it cycles until it boils dry, or someone notices and manually turns it off. Even the manual turn-off option is dicey, as there is nothing to indicate whether off is ""lever up"" or ""lever down"". I would not purchase this kettle again."
5,Great Product!,I like the product. It is very easy to use. It heats up very quickly. I recommend it to other potential buyers.
5,The best kettle. In the world. Ever.,"I bought this kettle when I was moving into an apartment and assumed I would be stuck with an electric cook-top stove that would inevitably take 14 years to boil water, by which time I would have given up my quest for a comforting mug of tea in favor of something more convenient (like beer?) (As it turns out, much to my delight, I ended up with a gas stove).I digress. The point is that I use my electric kettle every day, often more than once a day, to boil water for oatmeal, coffee, and tea, sometimes for cooking recipes, other times simply for jello....it doesn't matter. It takes no time at all, about two minutes, to boil a full kettle of water and automatically shuts off after the water boils. This feature makes it so safe for absent-minded-professors-in-training like myself. I highly recommend this product to anyone who drinks tea. Period."
1,Not what I expected,"I had to return this item. It only shut itself off one time, and the remaining times boiled itself dry. Also, takes quite a while to heat the water. I'll buy another brand this time."
1,Don't Trust This Pot 's Auto Shut off!!!,"This pot was wonderful for three days. boiled the water and shut off. Excellent. I used it a lot. The fourth day; i turned it on and went to brush my teeth while i waited for it.it didn't shut off.in that small amount of time it had boiled nearly all 1.75 quarts of water into steam which condensed under, on, inside of and on top of my kitchen cabinet and counter. The steam condensation ruined my cabinet in that short span of time. that $20 pot that i now can't use will end up costing me at least $350 plus labor...Made a wonderful steam room - so if that's what you're looking for buy it.If not and you still decide to purchase it - DO NOT TRUST THE AUTO SHUT OFF AND WALK AWAY FROM IT ...I'll be going back to the microwave which i can trust to shut off) for one cup heating or my whistling pot for two cups plus. (which i know will scream until i shut it off)"
3,Surprisingly poor for a West Bend product,"It boils water. That's what it's intended to do.However, the instructions are very poor - they don't tell you how to insert the filter, etc.The filter is difficult to put in place properly, and if you run without filter, the unit doesn't shut off very quickly.Since the unit is black, it's hard to see the water level - hard to tell whether I'm at the 1-quart mark or the .5-quart mark.I haven't bought any West Bend products lately, but I thought they were better quality."
3,Nice but...,"It's great for boiling several cups of water at once, but for smaller amounts, it's pretty much useless. Also, it does not shut off as advertised when it reaches a rolling boil. It stays on until the water boils completely away -- then it shuts off. Good if you need a quick couple of cups but don't leave it on for too long."
1,Cheap piece of junk.,"Kettle wobbles on base. Cord corral at bottom doesn't hold cord steady and base wobbles on counter. Supposed to turn off automatically when water is boiled, but doesn't. This kettle is dangerous, and should be recalled from the marketplace."
1,plastic water,"this is a cheap kettle, makes water taste of plastic and it doesnt switch off automatically. Next time i'll buy a metal one and spend a bit more money."
5,angel for an angel,I bought the ornament for a new grand-daughter for her first Christmas. It arrived in perfect shape and was perfect for her.
5,of the chain,NOW THAT IS A MUST READ BOOK. I PURCHASED THE BOOK ON SUNDAY AND WAS DONE ON DUNDAY NIGHT. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN TO SAVE MY LIFE. THE STORY WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT TO THE VERY END. MESSA AND BLACK WASS A REAL STORY TO ME. I LOVED THE WAY SHE HANDLED HIM. I WILL READ IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. IT JUMPS OFF FROM THE BEGINNING. I REALLY FEEL FOR ONE OF THE GIRLS IN THE BOOK I ACTUALLY CRIED TWICE. YOU WILL ENJOY.
1,Same story different author,"Sorry but these books are all the same. Girl meet dealer they hook-up break-up he sleeps around she fight the other woman, They have a kid or two and everybody is happy again. Please people get some new material to write about all these urban books read the same."
4,Nice...,"You never really know what you will get with a Triple Crown Novel...but i have to say that this book was excellent. Meesa and Black are two phenomenal characters. She is a classy hood diva and he is just your average hood, who have found one another and created life together! Very nice love story"
5,A GREAT READ ALL AROUND!,I read this book in 1 day! I think the characters definitely pull you in the book. I know some people who have went through similar things that Meesa and Black have went through so it definitely hit home. I think Kiesha did a great job and can't wait to read another one of her books. Come to Chicago for a book signing. You go girl...
4,ME AND MY BOYFRIEND,THE BOOK WAS ALRIGHT. A VERY QUICK READ BUT THE STORY LINE WAS NOT COMPLETE WITH THE DARYL CHARACTER. IF HE WAS SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE HOW DID HE SURVIVE AND HOW LONG DO IT TAKE TO HEAL? PLEASE TRIPLE CROWN CHECK YOUR TYPO'S AND CHAPTER SEQUENCES ARE OUT OF ORDER.
1,have not received,Race for the Double Helix (Purchased on 09/05/2008) by Tim Pigott-have never received the movie after contacting seller numerous times .....
3,"Cute, but a little too precious","I found the core notion that our home designs don't fit our lives to be very interesting. But be warned that the book is a series of very personal, sometimes bordering on superficial, essays. Beyond the core notion, I didn't find much to relate to in Busch's observations about her own(upper class, domesticated) life. She often makes blanket statements about how ""we"" live that more than once made me feel like she was writing for a whole other group of people I've never met. That said, if you do feel included in her blanket statements, you might love the book."
2,Good for a while,"This is a good blow dryer, but less then a year later it broke. I hardly ever write bad reviews, but my last blow dryer lasted me over 5 years.So I would recommend a blow dryer that cost a little more, because you'll end up spending more money having to buy another one in a year."
2,Cheap Product!,"I just bought this blowdryer a week ago, and I admit that it works great on my very frizzy hair! The problem? It broke the 2nd time I used it. The on/off button broke and so I can't turn it off. It's stuck on high. Definitely not worth it!"
5,Better than anything,"Length:: 3:38 MinsI just cleaned hot pink finger nail polish out of my carpet!!!! I have been using this product for years now and it never disappoints me. From my filthy car to dining room chairs, carpet and shoes with cloth lining, it's nothing it won't clean!!!! I am amazed with this product it is fantastic! Really it's a life saver..."
4,"works great, not perfect","I bought this after watching numerous videos online to clean Coach purses. Very nervous spraying onto the bag but it did get it cleaner. Not ""like new"" but better. What actually worked to get spots out was using 1 tbsp of dish soap (I used what I had on hand, some kind of green Apple scented stuff) and 2 cups warm water. Used a paper towel to rub spot and it completely disappeared! Then use a clean damp paper towel to get soap off and blot hard to absorb access moisture left. Left me impressed, I'm not spending $$$ on coach cleanser when a spoon of dish soap will work. The bag was cream colored fabric, not leather. (in case you were curious). But! On old carpet stains that I didn't even remember what it was or how it got there, worked like a charm! 2 spots gone in under a minute....now that's worth it. I bought my can at K-Mart for $3.99. So worth it!"
4,TERRIFIC!,"Being an Everest lover I thought this was about the Mountain. Nope, however this was a GREAT thriller with an excellent cast!"
2,condition,"the front cover of the ultra pro binder was very warped, with a bend crease obvious down the entire height of the cover. As a gift item it is not acceptible."
5,A New Deal For Asia by Mahathir Mohamad,This is an excellent book for anyone who wish to know the thoughts of Dr Mahathir on how Asia can reinvent itself for the new millennmium after the Asian crises. Grab a copy now to find out more.
1,THE COLLAPSE OF ALL SPORTS BOOKS,"Without question,John Rossi's book on the 1964 Phillies is the most inept attempt at sports literature that I've read in 59 years on planet earth.Not only does the author fail to convey the true feeling of the 1964 season,he fails time and again with the English language.Grammatical errors abound,factual data is constantly presented in repetitious banalities,much of the data is convoluted or simply erroneous,and the slipshod boxscores at book's end are simply unacceptable to all but those who still use crayons.Rossi was given an excellent topic and just simply wasn't up to it.Since I lost $30 and gained little or nothing in the process,just label me ""Losing Pitcher Mulcahey-2006"""
2,dissapointed,we have a few other Toby books which are well loved but this ones story didn't seem to flow very well. Maybe its from not having read the earlier books other than the first one but I wish they would have explained who was who instead of just saying names. we will try some of the other books and give this one away.
3,Interesting Overview,"The video consists of three segements; one of the dead sea scrolls, another about hebrew language pictograms which was interesting, and another about the history and development of the bible. It was interesting and informative. There was some speculative content, but not to mind bending. It was worth the time. [...]"
2,Leaves out the truth.,"Like all revisionist history books, this one convienantly leaves out references to anything that would dispute its claims.This book makes no mention of Deisim. Thomas Payne wrote a book called ""The Age Of Reason"" that detailed the beliefs of many of our founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson and most of the big names, yet, there is no mention of it or Thomas Payne. Face it Christains,many of our founders did not believe in Christ, Moses or Mohammed, and they had the good sense to put separation of church and state into the constitution. Thank God."
5,Excellent companion to the movie,A great movie based on a great play! This books allows you to go over the dialogs and discover details that one may miss when watching the movie. I suggest reading the preface after reading the whole play and then...start thinking!
2,this book is just the script,"No, it doesn't provide any further insight into her 'doubt'. Doubt about her faith or doubt about her scrutiny of the father."
5,Powerful,What a powerful piece. There are only 4 spoken characters in the whole book - yet so much goes on in such a short story/play. It is riveting and superbly written - considering it's only 60+ pages long.The play takes place in a 1960's Catholic Church School where a nun suspects the priest is molesting one of his students. It's a story about doubt. Did he do it? Was she wrong? Right? You just don't know. You are left with DOUBT. I found that the ending was well suited for this piece and I highly recommend it.
3,Okay,It was required for a class but I didn't enjoy reading the book. It is not my preferred genre of book to read.
1,a giant ripoff,This appeared to be a novel. It is only a few pages with less than 1/4 of the dialog from the movie. A TOTAL RIPOFF.
3,disappointed,"if I had known then what I know now I would not have purchased the book,it had a four and a half rating,no one mentioned liqueur,rum,bourbon etc. or the fact that 1/2 the recipes call for 4-5-6 egg yolks.All the recipes require cooking and cooling which take up time,that's ok up to a point,but all? On the more positive side the pictures are beautiful,but I do wish I had known these things,I would not have gotten the book,and stayed with my Ben&Jerry or the recipes I found on the internet. I can't really recommend this book,as I'm not at all happy with it."
2,Essick moist air humidifier filters,"Not the greatest. Glue on sides broke loose on 3 of 4 filters. Would not get these again, metal screen is better."
2,Filters too small this time,"I have the hardest time finding filters for my humidifier. Even though I order the exact product number that I am supposed to get, sometimes the filters I get are too large and must be trimmed down to fit, while other times they are too small. This time they were really small but I used them anyway and hope they won't fall out. If you order a set of Essick HDC-12 filters, it seems like they should all be the same size. Frustrating......."
1,Professional Grade? I don't think so!,The great price is the only great thing about this product. This is not a professional grade helmet! It looks more like something a child would wear for Halloween. I have opted not to return this because the shipping would cost more than the actual product refund. I guess you get what you pay for. On a positive note the seller shipped this to me very quickly.
3,Adequate and cheap,"I'm learning to weld, and I've never owned any welding gear, but I know that this is not what a pro would use. When you raise the mask, it starts to slowly slide back down. If you tighten it, you'll have to pull harder to lower it. No way you could ""nod it"" into the down position.On the plus side, it comes with an 11-tint glass, and it covers your face, ears, and neck. It will do while I'm a newbie, but if I get the hang of welding, I'll want to upgrade to a real welder's mask."
4,Welding purpose,Its great for the job! The flexible band i have to get use to but other than that this is just what i was looking for. The grooves in front helps me distinguish mine from other. If stolen i have no problem because most i've seen has a smooth finish. It is very light and not as big and bolky. just the right thing for the job.
1,Don't read this one first!,"I mistakenly read Falling Liberty before any of the other Ana Pigeon series. This one is poor example of Barr's skill and story telling finesse. She tosses out several over-ripe cliches that made me cringe in agony. Luckily, my wife persisted I read Track of the Cat and now I'm almost through the series.This one is regrettable."
2,Waiting for Anna's return to the West,"I really enjoyed Nevada Barr's Ill Wind, Track of the Cat and Firestorm and recommend them highly for mystery readers. I loved the isolated park experience that created these books setting. In ""Liberty Falling"" the city setting robs me of the things that I want to love about the Anna Pigeon mysteries. The action heated up toward the end of the book, but I had to fight to stay with it. I am waiting for Anna to return to the Southwest or Yosemite or Glacier National Park. This is one of the features that makes me love these books."
2,Another disappointed fan,"I am an Anna Pigeon fan and a very disappointed one. Nevada Barr's last two books have become overly descriptive and tedious. Liberty Falling is the worst to date. I read for entertainment, not to diagram sentences.Like a previous reviewer, I have wondered what happened to the characters Christina Walters and her daughter, Alison.I'd like to think that these reader reviews have an impact. I'm still interested in reading books like her earlier works but if Nevada Barr is tired of Anna Pigeon, then put her to rest."
4,Liberty Falling,Another great Anna Pigeon novelEasier read than some of hers but still enjoyableSimple plot but entertainingWorth the time to finish
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"After reading Deep South and Flashback, I was looking forward to going back and reading some of the earlier Anna Pigeon books. Liberty Falling has to be the worst of the Pigeon series. I found myself skimming over pages and skipping over the last third of the book to get to the end and hope the ending would make it worth the read. It wasn't."
2,Barr needs a rest and Anna Pidgeon needs character depth.,"It's very difficult to maintain a single protagonist-driven mystery series. And Nevada Barr's ""Liberty Falling"" shows us just that. Barr gives her usual fantastic ""like-you-were-there"" background/color. But there is only so much you can say about the site. After all, it is an island and while detail is what Barr's best at,the book quickly gets boring when she can't move her characters very far. As for Anna, she's not moved very far since the death of her husband. Even psychiatrist sister Molly now has a boyfriend. Anna's issues remain the same and they too have become dull. The alcoholic thing, the ""no man is an island except Anna"" thing, the no-friends thing, the death of her husband thing, no real color outside that of the book's setting. And while I was intrigued with life on Ellis, the previous book, in which Anna is forced into caving, is by far Barr's best to date."
1,Ugh!,"I never thought there'd come a time when I'd be embarrassed to recommend a Nevada Barr mystery novel. But, the time is now. This story was unimaginative and strained, the description repetetive and overwrought (if I had to read about the ivy tearing down the works of man one more time . . .), and her ""patriotic"" descriptions of the Statue of Liberty and of Ellis Island were nauseating. And there was none of the geeky nature information that I usually enjoy in her writing. I've turned on a number of fellow mystery buffs to the Anna Pigeon stories. I may have to suggest that folks read no farther than Blind Descent if her next novel is as poor as Liberty Falling."
3,Okay for the price,"To me this item just seems okay. I think my expectations were too high. No fault of the company, I simply thought it would be more plush."
5,xmas gift,"This was a christmas gift for my little sister. She loves Harry Potter, and asked simply for ""Harry Potter stuff"" for the holidays. My only issue was it was very hard to wrap :) hehe. The hat is exactly what we expected, with the wire holding the shape nicely, even through the shipping."
2,Not good quality,"So far 3 of the 10 don't work. not sure if it's the bulbs or the sockets; I haven't tried swapping them all. But whichever, this quality is unacceptable."
5,Historical!,Great book! Really shows how a public can be 'snowed' by the government! Relevant to today! Good read for someone interested in Political History.
2,Kick a dead horse,"Shall we discuss the 'German problem' once again? No, thanks. At least not in this so overly unobjective, clearly designed to perpetuate the Jewish lament, drasticly trashing-Germany-and-Germans way. Not again, please. Or is there a more persuasive reason to do so? Perhaps to exploit the advantages for the ever alert pro-Semitic cause? Or, since the pseudo scientific angle does't quite come off, could it just be a crass, avaricious profit motif?"
2,Buyer Beware!,"I had only read a page or two of this book when I thought, ""This is so badly edited that it must be self-published""--and it is! This is released by a print on demand publisher, and as quoted from Wikipedia, ""POD publishers generally do not screen submissions prior to publication."" Think about that before you buy this book."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide the I-Ching.,"I am enjoying the book. Because it also tells ancient stories besides imparting wisdom. Learning for one history along the way.In short, an interesting & educational book. Modern living can still learn the wisdom from bygone days?You decide for yourself. Can One?Magpie33"
1,Inaccurate measurements,"A lot of Mark Copeland's measurements are incorrect! The sauces are runny, and most recipes do not taste authentic. Don't waste your time or money with this book."
2,Preaching...Too Much!!,"I have just finished this book though my sister lent it to me last year. J. California Cooper is a great storyteller and normally I enjoy her books very much. This book, however, had too much proselytizing. Everything was ""Satan this..Satan that.."" ""God loves this...God loves that..."". It was extremely annoying and constantly pulled me out of the story. So many times I wanted to shout, ""Would you please just tell the damn story!!"" Like you had a really good friend who suddenly got religion and every time you turn around, there she is, right there, eager to tell you ""the good news"". Sigh..."
5,"Remove the ""Pseudo"" from your ""Pseudo-hip"" categorization.","If you want to stop chasing around after what you've heard is, or believe to be, the cool thing this season, stop right now and pick up a copy of Panda Meat. This book will make you the center of cool and the nexus of hip-intellectuality in the fly-over or port town of your choice. Panda Meat, Vol. 1 is the end product of over 100 independant artists (illustrators AND designers) who've set aside there differences long enough to entrust Mr. Frank Kozik with the editorial job of the decade thus far. The resulting collection is one that has been discussed with great enthusiasm in select coteries, coffee houses, local taverns, biker bars, hipster dives, knitting circles and living rooms across this great nation of ours. Be sure to get in on the ground floor of this phenomenon while you can still rub it in the faces of those who didn't."
3,Collection of Dragon Stories,"I found this collection of short stories and poems to be an enjoyable read. Just make sure you know that this is just edited by the Weis and Hickman, not written by them. If you want something to read during short breaks and not woryy about keeping up the with the continuity of a story. PPick up this book. Some of the stories are just great."
1,Did I miss something? Like the point to this movie?,"I've seen the earlier movies and liked most of them. I actuallysaw a broadband showing of this on my computer.I have no idea whyits called Amityville. The house is different, and it is NOT scary inthe least. I had to pause it and come back about 5 times to finish itI was so bored.Completely predictable...If you are EXTREMELYbored, need sleep material, or just can't find ANYTHING better to do,this is the movie to watch.Biggest waste of 1 1/2 hours I can thinkof.A child could watch it and not get scared. I have no idea whythey even put Amityville in the title. The ONLY connection I saw isthat the house is in Long Island, NY like the first house. Other thanthat, it's a totally different movie.I don't even want to thinkabout this..."
2,Embarrassing,"The amount of grammatical and spelling errors in this novel are incredible. I am not talking about the use of slang which is understandable in an urban book, but actual poor sentence structure and misuse of words in regular sentences. For example, in one case the author wrote that someone needed to ""cease"" an opportunity instead of ""seize"" an opportunity. In another case the author wrote the a character had a ""since"" that something wasn't right instead of ""sense"". There are too many of these mistakes to count. Who allowed all of these mistakes to get through editing? It is truly embarrassing, and made it hard for me to enjoy the content of book ."
4,AN EXCELLENT PAYBACK!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this book was well written because, for me it was real, and a shout out to young ladies that know when they don't fit in stop trying,just get ta stepping! as intelligent and fly as she was she was still vulnerable..PLEASE, PLEASE read this book !!!"
3,good plot poorly written,"I actually enjoyed the storyline, but some of it just seemed too unrealistic for words. The part where females can be so jealous they unmercifully set up one another for disaster, i completely agreed with. However the author pretty much let them off with a slap on the hand, with the exception of the one chick who originally dated the big name dope dealer. Now the part where the dope dealer, Dink, actively pursues a crackhead, aka Laci, for a girl friend just equals bad business; especially when she's not useful in any capacity as a worker. It just seemed like the writer got tired towards the end and wanted to wrap it up, because some things were just thrown out there without any substance prior to back it, or even elaboration warming up to a given situation. And then the icing on the cake was editing. Some one should have contracted a professional editor. It was an easy read, but it could have been easier if words were spelled correctly or the proper homonym was used."
2,Wasn't up to par,"The book was okay, not as good as everyone made it, it's a great book if you didn't pay for it, but I spent my 15.00 bucks, (((should've went to Hollister and got a shirt)))"
2,Dissappointed by water stains,"The item looks excellent out of the box and it looks even better on my lounge chair in the backyard. The manufactures description of the product states ""Olefin is a comfortable, durable and retains its color and strength while withstanding years of exposure to sunlight and rain."" This could not be further from the truth as after one day of exposure to the elements I now have terrible water stains on my cushions."
1,Con Man At It Again,Anyone who would buy anything from this con man gets what they deserve. There is nothing new here except the same sludge that Biscardi tries to pass off as fact. Biscardi is a blight in the true research community. There are SO MANY better videos by legitimate researchers. Do not waste your time with anything Biscardi does. Horrible!
4,"Good camera, but not the improvement I had hoped for","I bought the Canon A85 as an upgrade to my 5-year-old Canon S10. I liked the slightly smaller size, doubling the pixels, and greater optical zoom. I wanted to take advantage of improvements made over the last 5 years. Immediately impressed with ergonomics -- grip, buttons and playback zoom are excellent. The camera just feels great, and the price is unbelievably low. However, in doing picture comparisons with my S10, I'm saddened that the picture quality of the A85 is not as good as the old S10. Even with double the pixels, many details are not as crisp and colors are not as accurate -- more oranges and pinks. I am a point-and-shoot picture-taker, and yet I want the pictures as clear and accurate as possible. I liked this camera better before I did the side-by-side picture comparison with the old S10. I still think the A85 is an excellent, affordable camera -- but I may be putting it under the Christmas tree for someone else."
4,Reissue of first in series,"This is a reissue of the first in this series, originally titled ""Mail-order Murder."" The charm of the series is in the recounting of the mundane details of everyday life. Characters you care about and watch as they develop - what could be better!"
3,not too mysterious,"Lucy Stone is a small town mom. She works at Country Cousins, an LL Beanesque Catalog Company in Tinker's Cove Maine. She works 3rd shift, while on break she sticks her head outside to get some air, only something appears wrong. After she closes the door she can't shake the feeling that she heard something so she opens the door and listens again, this time she hears a car engine, and she goes to investigate, and she finds the owner of Country Cousins in his car wtih a hose running from the exhaust, to the window, an apparent suicide. This leads Lucy, to the who what where when and why.This book didn't have a lot of action. The story and the murderer just happened to fall into Lucy's lap. She didn't actually do a lot of investigating. There wasn't a lot of questions throughout the book. No red herrings, nothing to really throw you off.It wasn't a shock to see who committed the murders, I was a lot bored while reading this."
3,Reference Book,"One hundred articles organized encyclopedia-style, with photos and illustrations. Heavy on text, but the text is well written for middle and high schoolers. Useful as a reference, but not for entertainment. Grades 6-12."
1,Not Good,"I regularly buy Ultra Pro card sleeves and I agree with the reviewer below. These are NOT DECK PROTECTORS. I buy these Ultra Pro card sleeves myself but I use them for card storage because they are cheap (only $1 per 100) and thin -- so I can get a lot into a shoe box.The image you see above is for the cheap, thin storage sleeve and they should only cost $1. Ignore the price. Ignore the product DESCRIPTION. Look clearly at the product IMAGE because THAT is what you are getting -- and it sounds like this is true from what the reviewer below has written.Ultra Pro does make deck protectors along with other cool things, but this product is not it. High quality deck protectors might cost this much, but certainly not $1 storage sleeves."
2,Title is prime example of subject,"Problems: there is a lot of useless commentary; Gobe pushes political correctness in advertising; he generalizes about Baby boomers, Generations X and Y; he often supplies only anecdotal evidence for his ideas. On the other hand, he seems sincerely interested in the subject, and there's some real insight underneath all the BS. About what you would expect from an Ad executive."
1,Lots of Fluff,This book was a real disappointment. Don't be fooled by the strong editorial reviews. Upon reading the book it is clear that most are clients of Marc Gobe's concultancy.The main thrust of the book is that brands need to make an emotional connection with consumers. How they do this is never really detailed. How you measure the emotional connection is never really considered.A real disappointment.
2,whatever,"I am sure that, for at least few months, in 2000 this book might have been poignant or even insightful to anyone outside of the marketing field and did not know they where being marketed to. The book is full of vague and general idea that could have easily been squeezed into a 5 page magazine article. Reading it was like sitting at a red light with my passenger, pointing, and saying ""look, the light is red."""
4,A Good Balance for a Romance/Mystery Novel,"This was not too much of anything, and just enough of the important things we like to read: mystery, romance, character, plot, setting, dialogue, and description.I want to know WHO THIS AUTHOR IS or WAS, since ""Jessica North"" is only a pen-name. Please tell me, if you know?"
2,"Interesting, but brief","This is an interesting article, particularly for language teachers, but doesn't go into enough depth to justify a purchase at this price. Though it's certainly nice to have these articles available and easily searchable on Amazon, those in the know may prefer to go to the LLT website and read the article for free."
2,I didn't understand this movie at all?,"This movie makes no sense at all. It's called Vampire ""Vixens"" but there is only one vampire in the movie. The dialogue all seems adlibbed and some of it's just wierd. The woman are all really atractive but the scenes of the girls getting interviewed for some job have nothing to do with the plot. It's just an excuse for nudity. It's like watching two movies at once that have nothing to do with each other. It cuts back and forth between lesbian scenes and the vampire and her lacky ploting to kill Wally. I only even gave it two stars because it's got Darian Caine. Her scenes are worth watching. Except the last scene just cuts off abruptly to the credits. Overall disapointing, I expect better from Seduction Cinema, yes there super low budget but they're usaully better than this."
1,Unbelievable!,"I ordered this with high hopes after reading the reviews. The most basic thing didn't work at all--the volume knob. It wouldn't turn up or down at all. Unbelievable that this got past QA. Now amazon tells me they don't stock it anymore. With crummy quality like that, they shouldn't!"
5,Buy a PAL player for this DVD,This along with all the Farmer DVD's are top rated french rock - pop - dance. I love Mylene Farmer. I highly recomend all her DVD's.
1,The Odu Of Lucumi,"This author needs to seek the wisdom of Orumila. The translations are childlike.I was hoping the text would include more religious spells, particularly one to solicit the gods to get ignorant heathens to be quiet.I am also deeply offended that some uneducated white man could come along and steal my history and heritage like this."
5,Buy It,It is hard to believe that an artist this talented could be overlooked.This is a fantastic cd that is full of great RnB songs and smooth jazz vocals.It reminds me of the sound of Sade and Barry White mixed with the pop ballad sound of Hall and Oates.If you like these artist buy this cd you will love it.
5,"wow,,WHy is Hudson Young not a SUPER STAR??? WAY WAY TALENTED","This is by far one if the best cd 's out....This guy is super cool...super talented,,,,,Can not get enough of his music,,,BRAVO,,,,,The phrasing,the beat..the words,,,SUPER!!! ...I would give this cd 10 stars if I could,,,Makes other established ""stars"" sound like amateurs. HUDSON YOUNG IS A SUPER STAR , HE IS THE REAL DEAL,,,buy this cd and I dare you to disagree."
2,Nice photography but boring,"I expected this to be more travelog, but it was artistic photography with nature background sound. Boring and disappointing."
4,OK,"The music and singing were similar to the original artists, but it had some problems with timing. I still love to sing along with it and would order it again."
4,A great set of books!,"This is a great set of books to own for future MCP's. For all that you get, the price is UNBELIEVEABLY low! The CD's are an invaluable resource to prep for the tests. As the books say ""Dont let the real test be your first test!"" Some minor errors in the book self tests, but they are not ""mission critical"" errors and actually caused me to further reinforce the material I was learning. Between these and Alan Carter's MCSE Study Guide, I had the resource material to make the certification process go quite smoothly."
4,A nice simple introduction to amphibian biology.,"This is a nice, well illustrated book on amphibian biology. It is also simple and easy for the layman to understand"
1,Greatly Diasppointed- Damaged/defective Product!!!,"I bought this vhs tape on Amaazon several months ago and put it up until a convenience time to show it to my grandkids. Wellllllllllll, to my surprise when I inserted the vhs tape it wld not play and I discovered that the front end of the tape was unattached (almost falling off) and that was why the vcr player kept rejecting it. I carefullly taped it back in place with scotch tape and gently inserted it into the vcr player again praying it wldnt get stuck. Fortunately it played, the kids highly enjoyed Tom Smothers teaching showing his yo-yo tricks, but I will not use this vhs tape again b/c I don't want to take a chance it will get stuck and damage my vcr. Seller should have examined item before mailing it to buyer!Wasted Money!"
2,Poor quality and mismatched DVDs,"First, the quality is pretty bad and blurred. The strong military-style female voice is ""guiding"" each movement. The actors pause and wait for some invisible signal to do each part of each exercise! Second, DVDs inside my package were numbered 1, 2, and 6! All 3 DVD front covers show female performers, yet one (DVD #2) was mismatched with male performer DVD. Third, The menu gives choice of lesson 1 and 2 per each DVD but it plays just one long segment, so Lesson 2 would be a continuous second half of the same segment (without any announcement). You get the picture..."
2,Very disappointed.,"I am truly disappointed by the bad quality of this figure by ALTER. This figure has all the potential to be an excellent acquisition...the character is beautiful, the beach setting and the swimsuit are very nice and the height is great! But, it simple fell short on the quality department. The PVC material looks unfinished, there are various regions with certain ""patterns"" and the skin tone is different in various sections. On top of all this, my figure looks ""dirty""; literally speaking. It has like some kind of dirt on several parts of her skin. I guess I received an item part of a defective batch and not all the production is like this.Real product not even close to the shown pictures. The colors are pale and not vivid at all."
1,not the book listed,CarpentryThis is not the book advertised. It is a workbook for the book advertised. Very disappointed.
5,Great laundry sorter,"My husband has a hard time sorting his laundry and this has really helped. I leave it in his closet, so I can't really tell how well it would hold up if someone were to lug it to the washer. Overall, it has helped me out by saving time sorting laundry."
2,The Children of Noisy Village - video,It wasn't clear that the movie was dubbed in English. I wanted the Swedish version with subtitles. I was going to use it in teaching and now I just wasted good money that I could have bought other material for.
1,Joseph's narcissistic personality really shows...,"narcissism ( P ) Pronunciation Key (n√§rs-szm) also narcism (-szm)n.Meanings:1. Excessive love or admiration of oneself. See Synonyms at conceit.2. A psychological condition characterized by self-preoccupation, lack of empathy, and unconscious deficits in self-esteem.3. Erotic pleasure derived from contemplation or admiration of one's own body or self, especially as a fixation on or a regression to an infantile stage of development.If you are still unsure on the meanings, please pick this book up today for clarification."
5,Very satisfied,"I ordered 6 seasons from various sources on Amazon. All arrived quickly and in either ""new"" or ""near perfect/used"" condition. Very satisfied w/ purchase and would definitely order again."
4,Moving.,"The accounts of the actual people in the WTC to me arewhat made the book. Their descriptions of the carnage theywitnessed as they were rushing out of the buildings, putsyou right there. The pictures recap the events of the daywith dignity. I'm glad I grabbed a copy of this."
1,Quiet hair dryer wanted,"Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair. Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers. Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels."
5,Perfect!,It is perfect...a great fit for the start of my career. I knew I wanted to have a Hot Tools product because of the quality and the price. I was so happy to see for myself that the price was fabulous and the quality superceded that. I am so happy about this product!
3,Good read,"This book was Clear, Concise, and helpful. Was hoping for a few more techniques, but realize it's more of straight building/conditioning."
2,Too snug for the MZ67,"The padding, straps, and extra compartments for SD cards are all advantages, but the fact that the case is too tight for the MZ67 outweighs those advantages. It makes withdrawing and replacing the camera too time-consuming. Good shots can get away while you're extracting the camera from the case."
5,A REAL Motivator!,"I do not own the Personal Power 2, Yet! But, when I first saw his Infomercial at 1 o clock in the morning I was hooked! Now, at night I wait for his infomercial to come on! And I am disappointed when it doesn't.My point is...he is the REAL Thing! Just watching his Infomercial made me motivated to go do what I set out to do!!!Attend his Seminars, Buy his Products, Visit his Website, and Watch his Infomercials!!! Soon you will be on your way to Great Successes!!!!"
3,Pretty Good Movie,"Mystery Alaska was a good film about Hockey. It kind of reminded me of The Bad News Bears meets the NHL. Instead of kids however, the Mystery Alaska hockey team are a bunch of Adults all with problems of their own...which you will find out about by watching this. The cast is good, and I would say the 2nd half of the movie is much more fast paced than the first. It was another good performance by Burt Reynolds. Die Hard Hockey fans will love this movie. ALl others I would recommend renting this before purchasing it."
3,Difference of Opinion,"It was listed as Used acceptable. The only thin acceptable about this was the package in which it was shipped and the actual DVD which is why I am keeping it and not returning it. It came with what I believe is coffee stains all over the paper insert for the DVD case. Not to mention it is not the original case. I will eventually be putting this in my own ""CLEAN"" DVD case."
4,A satisfied non-hockey fan,"Well, I'm a woman and I'm NOT a hockey fan and I was pleasantly surprised when I found that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I came to care about the characters (and they are real CHARACTERS) in this little Alaskan town. The movie was very funny while also very touching. There were so many special touches added (like a couple surprise cameo appearances) which add to the fun. The acting was topnotch, especially Russell Crowe and even Burt Reynolds. I found myself laughing outloud in more than one scene and cheering for the 'underdog' team during the final game. This movie isn't so much about hockey as about the human spirit, value of relationships and hometown pride. I'll definitely buy this movie when the price comes down."
3,"You don' have to like sports to like this 'Mystery"".","Sports fan? You don't have to be to enjoy Mystery, Alaska. While it won't go down as one of the greatest sports movies ever, it offers more than might meet the eye. While the signature star might be Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds is very, very good, as is Mary McCormick. So, should you buy Mystery, Alaska? Well, as a fan of sports movies, I still wait with great anticipation to watch the end of movies like Hoosiers, Major League, and Tin Cup. Three exceptional sports movies. 'Mystery' offers something a little different. Nice cast, reasonable storyline, interesting characters, and a not so predictable ending. If you are a fan of GOOD movies, regardless of the genre, add 'Mystery, Alaska' to your collection."
1,Worst movie ever,I will never watch Ally mcbeal or the practice and i will never see a Russel crowe movei beacuse the story in this was so cliched and the acting so melodramatic it makes you hate hockey
5,Greatttt,This is one of my favorite movies a great story and a great hockey movie. This was a great movie and I absolutely love it. I watch it constantly and I have many friends who feel the same way.
4,Simple fun,"I liked the movie. It was fun to watch a movie that was simple entertainment....I like Russell Crowe and think his portrayal and acting was right on. I liked the whole town....simple fun, no brain surgery here, just sit back, relax and enjoy....."
3,titalating good fun,"If you expect great things by way of acting, direction or plot, you've got the wrong movie"
3,Definitely not perfect,"Just received the 23"" Samsung (white) for my kitchen. First issue I have is with the stand - how in the world could they make a TV stand that doesn't allow you to tilt or rotate the TV while on its base. If I had known that you couldn't do that I wouldn't have bought it. The image is mediocre - nothing really special - may be due to the channels (non-digital). This also causes a problem with the Captions - you can't increase their size unless they are digital channels - whatever the reason is, doesn't seem to make sense. So now we have a bigger TV in our kitchen, but with smaller captions!! My wife's mother tongue isn't English, so that is why I was looking forward to this TV - to get bigger subtitles! Oh well, I will give it a few days and will probably return it."
1,Are you serious?,Reading through the reviews of this film I can't help noticing that there are two distinct categories of reviewers - those who thought this film was a special effects blockbuster with great acting and others who thought it was terribly acted with duff effects. I seem to be caught between two stools because it's both these things - TERRIBLE acting from the human characters - how does Pierce Brosnan get employment? GREAT acting from the dog. TERRIBLE effects - just wait until you see the damn bursting - GREAT special effects - the town being blown away - all this combined with the most ridiculous plot imaginable.Immensely enjoyable even though I didn't know whether to laugh out loud at the film's most sensitive moments... I could equally have given this film 5 stars although it depends on whether you've got a sense of humour. Sometimes the 1 star films are the best.
5,Superior Disaster Thriller,"Except for Volcano, it is possible to make a great movie about a volcano. Dante's Peak is probably one of the best action/disasters around, plus Twister. Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton are very good together! The FX are brilliant. The DVD is one of the best, with interesting behind the scenes stuff."
4,"Disaster film formula, still enjoyable.","Hero finds problem, boss doesn't believe, disaster strikes, hero saves. Standard formula in disaster films but, it is brought off well in ""Dante's Peak"". The video is shot well and the scenery is nice in that area. I watch this often and enjoy each time. For additional info watch the features, it is interesting how they did things. Watch and enjoy for what it is, entertainment without having to do a lot except watch and enjoy."
4,believable movie,"I saw it when it came out in theaters back in '97. While there are obvious creative license employed throughout the movie, it is a really believeable movie. The setting of the movie, a small town set in the American Rockies celebrating their founding and being named the ""2nd most desirable town, population under 20,000."" The script, acting, and flow of the characters goes well together like a well oiled machine. Definatly worth having in your DVD or Instant Video collection."
4,Suspenseful,I just love these kinds of movies; they keep you at the edge of your seat...you know? Good movie from start to finish!!!
5,Pixar short Films,Great Collection. I am not a fan of the earlier Pixar shorts but my 3 year old loved them. Its nice to have all of these great works on one disk.
3,"Rent First, before you decide to buy.","I grad i rent it first, i was bit dissapoting pixar didn't do a good job with this disk, come on is blu-ray, it claim is 50GB Blu-ray disk, i doubt it is, total of video is about 55 minuts, not much in extra, about 1/3 of movie is full screen formal and bad quality, i expect pixar aleast make it hd but it didn't but the other 2/3 pixar did excellent job. However all the good one you had probably had watch it before in theater (other pixar film) i expect aleast some new creation for this disk but it didn't. Is not worth 23 buks, more like 15 i think. still rent it first, couple video is very good worth watch it many and many times over it."
4,Great for kids,"This is a great source of entertainment for kids. The short films keep attention and there are some great lessons, especially in the short film called ""Boundin'"". Excellent DVD!"
2,weak whistle,"this tea kettle looks nice and everything but it barely whistles (sometimes not at all). i'll turn the stove on, sit back down to read a book or whatever and 15 minutes later i'm wondering why the hell the water hasn't boiled yet. why the hell won't it whistle?"
5,Great book!,"I'm not a gardener, but I need to learn about growing things in shady places. This book is wonderful, easy to read, pretty to look at, and simple enough for an uninformed person. At the same time, it has lots of good info that even an experienced gardener could learn.I can hardly wait to get out into the dirt!"
5,Good Teaching Material,"""Twelve Armenian Folk Songs"" is a collection of short compositions that are based on original Armenian melodies. Many of them are based on simple five finger positions that are altered only slightly. Modal sounds, contrary motion, ostinatos, and lyric melodies make it a stimulating source for early piano students. Some of the pieces are challenging but they are all based on the repitition of patterns. The collection provides a more intellectual and creative challenge to the young pianist than is commonly found in piano literature. I love teaching these pieces and most importantly, my students love playing them. The difficulty level of this collection is similar to Bartok's ""For Children."""
4,Great Smell. I cant get enough of it!,I have made it to my 2nd bottle of Glow after Dark and I just cant get enough of it. It is great for a night out. I would def. recommend this. It is very sweet but I never fail to get a compliment!
4,A must for any Garmin GPS,"A GPS without map software is like a computer with no operating system. City Navigator definitely makes life easier and if you get the 2GB microSD (transflash) memory card, you can load the entire DVD of North American maps (about 1.6GB).I was a little surprised, however, that even with the new version 8 I'm finding several innacuracies (roads and POIs). I realize that old roads are changed and new roads are built and businesses come and go. But Garmin charges about $130 for the City Nav NA v8 and about $100 for the upgrade. I just think that for as much money as you spend on the unit, case, power adapter, mounts, memory card and the maps, you should at least be able to get updates free for a period of time.In my mind, that is equivalent to a motherboard manufacturer providing firmware updates for a couple of years. Anyway, the cost of maintaining current maps and innacuracies are why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
4,PC Only please,"Mapping is accurate, as far as I can tell. Easily loads to my Garmin Cx from a PC. The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because it's not compatable with a Mac OS. I had to use a PC from work to load it. I hope Mapsource works on compatability with Mac in the future. Otherwise, a great product."
3,Garmin City navigator,"Hello,I have bought the city navigator for North America. It is a good product in general, but I was very disapointed that it couldn't find most of the KOA campgrounds I wanted to visit.Robert"
5,really good app,Great app for the price. Works as expected without any problems. I am happy with the performance on the gps we use this with.
5,Garmin MapSource City Navigator,The item was exactly as expected and I saved ~$30 over the stated retail price from the vendor. I chose Amazon.com because I was reluctant to go with some of the other web sites out there that may or may not be legitimate. My merchandise arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged properly to avoid damage. What else could someone ask for? I will definitely use Amazone.com again in the future.
1,No Unlock Code Was Provided,"Extreme hassle getting it to unlock without the code, it was not provided with the product. I have nearly $1000 invested in GPS and maps, too much money to cram in Garmin's ....trash. I'm stuck with it.I'll never buy Garmin again."
1,Wrong Version Received,"The picture shows V8 (version 8). I did not receive version 8, instead I received the old version. I paid extra to get 2 day shipping for a trip I am taking this weekend. Now I have to return it, wait for them to get it, wait 7-14 days for a refund and pray that I get the correct version next time. Otherwise, this is definitely false and deceptive advertising."
3,Incompatible with 64-bit XP,I wanted to install this on my main computer but was unable to detect the GPS unit. Technical support was of no help telling me to try re-install etc ... Anyways after getting frustrated I googled my problem and found that Garmin does not support 64-bit OS. Hopefully this will change with the release of Vista. Another annoying thing is unlocking the maps. Since I could not get it working on my main machine (XP 64) I switched to another (XP Pro) and unlocking the maps was a hassle. Once everything was setup it worked great!
2,Used to be the Best Baby Book ......,"I bought one of these for each of my five children between 1976 and 1996. At that time it was hard bound, and it was a wonderful book where I could record all of my baby's information up to the seventh birthday.NOW this book has been changed to 3-ring binder style. The pages of the one I ordered were punched too high, making them not fit in the 3-ring mechanism, and the pages would not turn properly.The binder itself is soft vinyl - stitched around a stiffener, and the pages catch under the edges of the vinyl inside the binder.The content of the pages is still similar to the old versions, but the problems with the 3-ring binder make it not worth dealing with, in my opinion.It's unfortunate that this book doesn't seem to be available in the hard cover version anymore, and for that reason, I am going to buy my new grandson a different book entirely. I will miss My Baby's First Seven Years....What a shame....."
1,overpriced.....,After much research I enthusiastically ordered this product. Upon receipt I found the binder to be flimsy and the inside pages poorly designed. The poor print quality and design left me disillusioned. This binder won't stand the test of time as an heirloom. The well considered content is masked by poor graphics. Previous editions are superior.
3,Overpriced,"As it is with many newborn/baby articles often purchased by new parents or grandparents, this ""must have"" article is way overpriced. Yes, it is nice and had a leather cover, but it is essentially only a binder with a bunch of pre-printed pages."
5,I listen every day!,"This album is like a red wine that gets better with age. Since work blocked Pandora and I subsequently lost my Great Lake Swimmers station, I have listened to this album at least once a day and I love it more every day."
2,Long on pictures; short on analysis,"Given author Newberry's design responsibilities at world-famous consultancy firm Tom Walkinshaw Racing, I had hoped that this book would contain intelligent critiques of current car designs and trends. Instead, it is a collection of glossy manufacturer-supplied photos and relentlessly positive model descriptions that read like mildly reworked press releases from the factory headquarters. Perhaps Newberry's employer wouldn't let him offend any existing or potential clients but, if you are hoping for objective design analysis as opposed to a pretty summary of sales brochures, look elsewhere."
2,Ha!,I got this for giggles. And boy was it funny. Although it does have naughty bits it has horrible acting and a weird monkey. It was still extremely funny and if just want some time to waste watching a bad film... this would be it.
2,When is a knot not a knot?,"The studs as knots are beautiful, but the knots as studs are terrible. They fell out of the dress shirt I bought along with the studs. Either the button holes are too big (not likely or the backing for the studs is way too small. They do not ""pop out"" they don't even stay in the hole, but just slip out. This is a good example of bad design. What do I do, sew up the button holes? Send out the silver studs to have larger backs soldered on? Something just isn't right here."
4,An well made film on the fantasy of romance.,"When a American President (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Micheal Douglas) enjoys his unpreccedental popularity until he`s attractive to a perky environmental lobbyist (Annette Bening). When his growing passion, he has for the Lobbyist but until American Citizens have become curious about his life and it might hurt his carrer as President.Directed by Rob Reiner (Stand by Me, The Princess Bride, Misery) has made Aaron Sorkin`s Screenplay into a Populist Fantasy. This film has Terrific Performances by Douglas, Bening, Martin Sheen and Micheal J. Fox. This film was Critically Successful from Critics and Audiences. The Film was an Oscar Nominated for Best Score. This is a Smart, Romantic, Dramatic Comedy film. Panavision. Grade:A-."
5,"Great film, regardless of politics involved.","If you're looking for a story that has true-life politics and accurate representations of parties, I guess The American President might not be for you. But c'mon, we're talking about a movie here, and an enjoyable one at that. Immerse yourself in the situation, and you will become involved with a touching and emotional film about a president who actually has high moral standards (yeah yeah... realism isn't the high point in this flick) and his lobbiest girlfriend who really DOES have no hidden motives (yeah yeah...).So just sit back and enjoy the film, because if you don't get offended by the apparently unrealistic politics, then it's fun to watch (even if you hate michael douglas and annette bening, who aren't my favorites by all means)."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you like a movie that hides its formulaic nature and hackneyed situations behind high-class actors and the occasional witty clip, The American President is the movie for you; almost everything done well in this mediocre film was done better in the West Wing."
1,"An affair to remember, The american president & Love affair","I was about to get in touch with you because my purchase has been a disaster. All 3 DVDs are not compatible with the European standards, and it says on the back of at least one of them that the item are not allowed to be sold outside USA and Canada. I did of course not recognice this before I had given them away as a present to my parents, they had for such a long time wanted these movies. It was a sad moment when they put the first DVD in the DVD player. So they are of course all unwrapped because I was sertain that a well known company like yours did not fool around with theyr customers......I am so dissapointed.I had to pay toll on them as well when they came to Norway, so if I get 3 new ones send I will have to pay toll once more???? Then the purchase is becoming rather expensive for me.So what can you do to make amends? I am rather angry about this.Rango"
2,We are all Left Wingers now...,"The title of this one could have been ""we are all left-wingers now."" Here we have an incredibly cool, Leftist President with a gorgeous girlfriend and an impossibly cute daughter, fighting off all of those evil conservatives. Basically, this movie is Hollywood's ecstatic dream of a Leftist president of a Leftist America getting acclaim for declaring that he is a ""...card-carrying member of the ACLU...!"" Well, aren't we all?If the script could have avoided gagging the viewer with a high-pressure liberal rant, this could have been a charming movie about a handsome cool widower President and a gorgeous and charming girfriend. That alone would have, or at least could have, have made for decent entertainment. But no, we simply have to take our medicine in the form of 200 proof Leftist bias, and unfortunately many of us just cannot choke it down.If you don't mind the bias, there is a decent (not great) movie in here somewhere. Good luck finding it. RJB."
3,At times entertaining but overall unrealistic,"""The American President"" has moments of humor as one recognizes bizzare situations that would happen as a result of a bachelor President. However, that is what precisely makes this film hard to swallow. The idea of a President who gets into these types of fixes doesn't make me feel any safer. Also, this film, not surprisingly, plays heavily with the liberal Democratic social viewpoint. That in and of itself doesn't bother me, but the fact that it was so obvious was annoying."
2,"silly and predictable, embarrasingly so.","silly and predictable, embarrasingly so.The plot is designed for readers of the People's Magazine and viewers of bad soap operas. It is badly cast, predictable, and mawkish."
3,"Great movie, but DVD is lacking in quality","While this movie is great, the treatment by the studio on DVD does not do it justice.Little to no extras, a snapper case, and a poor transfer that can be noticed on anyone's TV (not just high end systems) detract from an otherwise excellent film. In the beginning, watch the ties that are worn, and how much they shimmer as they or the camera moves. I think this DVD might have been transferred from a copy of the VHS tape picked up at the local retailer... Oh well, at least it's letterboxed (but not anamorphic).Should you buy this DVD? Of course! But c'mon, Warner Home Video, let's redo this title and give it a better treatment. I'd buy a Special Edition with anamorphic video, commentaries, and other extras in a heartbeat!"
5,the american president,"i've seen the movie before on hbo, but don't want to wait till it's on again. That is why i purched the movie. to bad our government can't run the same way. They should have more movies that show how things work behind the scenes, then people will see that everything it's as easy as we say or think it should be."
5,nana,Great movie. Everyone should see this at LEAST once. My family has watched it hundreds of times. It's a classic .
5,Funny and Romantic,"This is one of my favorite movies. Michael Douglas and Annette Benning are charming together. Not only a love story, but a political insight that rings true."
2,Worst DVD Transfer To Date,"It's hard to imagine how a DVD transfer could have been worse. Considering it is a dual-layer disk there is absolutely no excuse for the poor quality (artifacts, HUGE pixelation problems, etc.) and lack of extra features. I guess it didn't make sense to show a couple of guys in a dirty lab holding up a DV camcorder while the movie played as a ""Making of The American President DVD""..."
4,"Wonderful movie, but DVD is poor quality","I've always enjoyed watching this movie on TNT, which is what compelled me to purchase it on DVD. Michael Douglas is charming and believable as a man who falls in love while facing the continuous challenges of being both president of the United States and a politician fighting hard to get re-elected. The set design and the dramatic scenes with Douglas and his ""cabinet members"" and ""high-level military personnel"" were also very believable. However, the quality of the disk is grainy, and the ""movie screen"" format not only shrinks the images, but it also distorts them. The movie's frames ""hang"" in spots, suspending the action for seconds at a time on and off throughout the film. My recommendation: Stick to TNT's reruns."
4,One of my favorites,"Film is great -- DVD however stops half-way through and can't get it to play second half. Had to toss it! I ordered a second copy for my library but it, too, stopped half-way through and could not get it play rest of movie. I give up. I won't order additional DVD's from Amazon."
2,Unbelievably cruel and depressing.,"Warning to readers, especially female ones: this book contains scenes of graphic cruelty, in particular one especially disturbing and explicit scene of the sexual torture of a woman. The book is interesting, but gets bogged down in the author's obvious enjoyment of the oppressive world he has created and the evil men that inhabit it."
2,Stay far away from this one..,"To start off, ugh. What a disgusting guide. I'm amazed that they can call it a ""guide."" It's more of a low quality kind of toilet paper.My two major gripes are that there are not enough practice questions, and that the few answers of those included are not explained correctly. That's true of all English Literature review books, since the questions are all somewhat subjective, but this book contains the most severe problems.From cover to cover I finished this ""book"" in 1 hour. It's much too small to be effective. That's unfortunate, because if it had been a bit better, this book might have been worth your time. Move along, I recommend Peterson's AP Success.. Not great, but definately better."
3,"Lousy walkthrough, but I made it somehow","... While it doesn't give spoilers, which I appreciate, it also offered precious little strategy and no insight into how the actual system of the game works. Also, the language was frustrating. I realize this was a publication written by a veteran gamer, but the grammar, spelling and syntax are absolutely awful, like reading an e-mail from a pre-teen.Still, it did ensure that I didn't miss anything, so I can't complain too much."
1,Pathetic cheap blanks,"these cheap blank cds have a possiblity of not working, because they didn't work for me. dont be fooled by the other customers review, it may seem cheap and like a good deal but it's not. dont't be cheap go to a large retail store and purchase your blank cd's, atleast if thier defective, or uncompatible you can have a chance of getting a refund without paying postal costs (8.95 for these), but for now on i will stay away from ridata(poor customer service) and memorex(who used to be the best, but they stop double layering the cd's causing them to be uncompatible and they think people dont notice)."
2,Nothing to write home about,"I had high expectations after reading the reviews here, but I hate to say it, after using this product I am not impressed. It is a nice conditioner but didn't do anything spectacular! My hair is chemically straightened (thermal reconditioning) and is very dry, so I am looking for a really good deep conditioner, unfortunately I did not find it in this product. I used this conditioner once and left it on for ten minutes in the shower. My hair really does not look or feel any different than any other deep conditioner I have ever used. The only difference is the horrible smell of this product, it wears off, thank goodness, but be warned it is not a nice smell! There are plenty of other deep conditioners on the market that work just as well and smell ten times better!"
1,Boring,"Not worth the money. The ads on TV and on the web are compelling, but ultimately deceptive. These DVDs each contain a few events that drag on for ever. Unlike the ads which suggest that you'll see a great variety of events and people, the actual DVDs contain the same few girls repeatedly doing the same thing. Very disappointing."
3,scent2,This is an ok scent but it's a little irritating to my skin for whatever reason. I've never tried the name brand version so I don't know how it compares to it. For the price it's worth it just to see if you like it.
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this book. There are a number of errors that I have found in the materials that I am most familiar with which causes me to doubt most of what is said about the things I am unfamiliar with. Dupuy seems in most cases to merely be parroting back popular American conceptions of history, which often have little to do with what really happened. The mis-labeled cover photo (it's an M-60 not an M-1) is definitely a warning sign that should be heeded."
1,"Thoroughly, thoroughly worthless","There are a lot of infertility books out there. Most of them repeat the same information over and over again. This is one of the more worthless specimens of this latter sort. If you haven't read a single infertility book, then you might find something of value in this book. (But I would get it -- or something similar to it -- from the library if I were you.) If you've already done some reading, then skip this one -- there's nothing new in it."
4,Professionalism and profits from the get-go!,"As a waitress where I often spent more time socializing with my customers then serving them, I learned how I can make better money, more efficiently and in effect work smarter; not harder. The advice in this book really made the difference in my overall tips and service."
2,Not as good as other Bob's,"I wish I had read the reviews on Packer. I would have skipped him too. My 2 1/2 year old LOVES him, but I dread the day when the little plastic peg breaks off. I am thinking about super glue, but my son likes to take off the trailer. I don't understand why they would make his trailer from plastic...does't make sense and makes him kind of cheap. Oh well!"
5,Packer :),"Anything from the Bob the Builder series is FUN, I recommend this and all the other toys Amazon features from them."
2,Not what it purports to be,"This book suffers from a problem in the billing it has been given. I was disappointed. Having purchased it, I would say it should be categorized as a teaching aid, and the book itself suggests that it may be useful to doctors, nurses, or teachers-anyone whose work involves talking with people about their bodies. Unfortunately the book is for sale at Amazon in a section that suggests it is an art book. The coy cover also suggests that this will be a book that seeks to explore the female genitalia in terms of the abstract beauty of the human body. It was on that assumption that I bought it, anyway. In fact, the photographs have little artistic appeal. They are quite clinical. There is little erotic appeal either-for the same reason. If you need a set of examples of female genitalia for some illustrative purpose, this book is fine. If you are seriously interested in art photography, go elsewhere. If it's pornography you're after, hit the newsstand-or your browser button."
4,Generally of good quality - this is how it is!,"The only book dedicated to this subject I have seen.Most photographs are of good quality, one or two of the subjects have highlights from flash equipment, which would benefited from softer, or less direct lighting, and one or two, would be much better with a greater depth of field. While I understand the object of the book was to show it, how it is; at least one of the exhibits, photographically speaking, would have benefited from a little ""gardening"" beforehand."
3,Disappointed,"I love the concept of this book and I wanted to like the execution but I didn't. The author depended upon volunteers so she got what she got. I was seriously distracted by the cracked, broken, dirty fingernails. If the models couldn't wash their hands, what else did they neglect? I'm sorry but I kept thanking god these were only pictures."
2,Seemingly A Waste Of A Good Tree,"This book is neither informative or in any way educational. Anywoman who thinks that her vulva is ugly or deformed, as a reviewerproffered, has no basis for comparison from this book. There is no mention of the ages of the women photographed. The saying that""they all look the same"" does not apply Save your money. I looked at it once then trashed it!"
3,"S(h)elf Help Guide, To get caught shoplifting.","This book is only an overview of tactics that only the worst shoplifter would use. As a member of a loss control team at a department store, I found the tactics talked about in this book to be juvinile. If these tactics were used you are going to end up in a loss control office and in the back of a police car. The books interpitation of store regulations on shoplifting don't take into account how we catch shoplifters, we don't always follow the store regulations. His interpitation of how loss control teams work are incorrect, his knowledge of security camera opperation is also no where near correct. This book is worth a few laughs, but not worth reading if you want to start shoplifting. The book is poorly researched and developed. Offering little knowledge into shoplifting."
4,Its all in the way the door closes,Smith is absoluetly astounding in the way she captures the raw emotion felt by CJ. The gradmothers place in the story is gut wrenching having to watch her family in this situation. Smith should be commended as she did a wonderful job showing her audience what it is life when someone important to you walks out of your life. It's all in the way the door closes. This story explores life on so many different levels. . This is a must read for all children... Superb!James Smith

5,,Bonnette's wide-ranging and erudite study examines not only the origin but also the destiny of the human species. A fascinating work.
4,A Heads Up for U.S. Viewers,"The movie is superb and rates 5 stars.Amazon is remiss however in not telling potential U.S. buyers that, although the Blu Ray of the movie is region free, the extras are all on a PAL compatible disc that will not play on U.S. Region 1 Blu Ray players.Hopefully a U.S. Blu Ray edition is in the works."
2,My handle broke too!,"This is my second one of these and the handle on this one broke after 15 months. On the first one, the plastic ring that holds the whils together broke within a year.Shame because I love the look and feel and function of this tea kettle but function doesnt mean anything if it doesn't function.But I have just spent 2 hours goign trhough every tea kettle that Amazon and others offer. I am going to try Copco's one touch. I think I have had it before a few years back and was very happy with it. Unfortunately, Amazon does not carry it in black, so I have to look elsewhere."
4,Eternal Blue,"This is a great movie for first time El-Hazard fans. It gets you involved with the characters, and leaves you hanging, begging for more! any Tenchi fan will love this action-packed romantic comedy."
1,Looks good but not good quality.,"We purchased this at a store, after looking at all the stainless tea kettles, to replace an old Revere Wear whistling tea kettle. Problems we noticed right away: The whistle is not loud enough to be heard from another room, plus the lid fits so tightly that it has to be pried out with a knife, and water boils out around the handle of the lid. Although we washed it every day and refilled it with bottled water, within three months, the bottom of the inside was pitted and rusting! If someone wants a good looking inexpensive tea kettle to use once in a while and then dry out after each use, then this may work."
4,Bizarre and thoughtful end to the Gazetteer series,"This is the final chapter in the acclaimed Gazeteer series! This one covers the wondrous Clansmen of the far steppes. Included are culture, magic, shaman rules, a giant poster map, new spells, rules for new PC types, and some of the most gorgeous artwork you'll ever see in a D&D module! An ingenious sourcebook that will leave you thirsty for more."
4,"Radient, Vibrant!","This book was radiant, vibrant, and full of life! mattie's comical nature will grab ahold of you and keep you on the edge of your seat. When this lttle old woman meets up with a stray dog and a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent, the only thing you can expect is a good ride with lots of twists and turns."
5,Instant CLASSIC!,"I hadn't seen the initial release of this movie in theaters, but was somewhat interested. Recently rented it via N!@#$%x and was BLOWN away.I don't want to alienate anyone, but if you are a gamer, you will LOVE this movie. BUT PLEASE, if you are not a gamer, you will enjoy the movie based on the acting, the incredible wit of the screenplay and the loveable characters. This movie has enough one liners to become an instant classic. GREAT CHARACTERS....ALL OF THEM. They're all so unique and interesting. No clones in this movie.And outside of the action, the characters and the script, you have this amazing visual presentation that is just stunning; like nothing I've seen before.I've already watched this movie four or five times since I laid eyes on it two weeks ago. And I just ordered the bluray for keeps.I want a sequel, but don't think it will ever happen. This is an instant classic!"
5,Scott Pilgrim on Blu-Ray is a Must-Have,"I love everything about the collection. What's not to love? It has a blu-ray with loads of bonus features, a DVD version with a reasonable about of bonus features, and for now, a digital copy of the film - which you must download from itunes, or windows media, etc. It's free, and that's never a bad thing. The only thing that I'm slightly bummed out about are that many of the bonus features are in standard definition. That being said, there are a ton of bonus features and there is always something new to explore. There are also multiple commentaries that are enjoyable to listen to -- Not like Shawn Levy's boring commentary for Date Night. I mean, seriously, How many times did that guy use the word ""Literally?""Anyway, buy the blu-ray. Buy it on Amazon.com and save some money. It's worth it, either way."
3,"Good movie, but disappointed","Every time I watch this movie I LOL, so I finally gave in and decided to buy the DVD. While usually ordering from Amazon has been nothing but perfect, I was disappointed when my DVD arrived and was clearly loose in the package. I'm sure Amazon doesn't plastic wrap their own DVDs so they could not have anticipated the DVD being loose inside, but when you can hear it knocking around in the case, that should raise a red flag. Upon opening the package, I found that the squeezie thing in the middle that holds the DVD in place was broken, thus causing the DVD to roll around and get scratched up. Fortunately, it wasn't too scratched and not worth returning, but Amazon should pay more attention to this sort of thing."
5,BOSS FIGHT!!!,"A film that takes the teen action comedy to a new level but those who have not experienced the graphic novels of Scott Pilgrim nor arcade/video games are likely to be confused about some parts of the movie. In some ways it's like a musical but instead of breaking into song it breaks into Matrix style Boss Battles that are more clever than high octane fueled. Regardless, the asides and remarks are truly colorful and vibrant. Pilgrim chose the wrong girl but I'll let you decide when you see the ending. After reviewing this movie I just might rent it again or maybe even buy it. DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B to B plus; INNOVATION: A plus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2010; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus."
3,Totally different to expectations,This was a strange movie. It was quite an interesting way of doing a movie which worked for the first half of the movie but got slightly tired towards the end. I even felt myself dozing off during the last third of the movie and if I do that I know it has not held my attention well. I guess a 42 year old woman is not it's target audience and perhaps it would go down better for a twenty something male watcher. Not a bad movie but just has to be your thing to enjoy it.
3,Meh... ok film,"Im going to compare this film to Donnie Darko and the Mortal Kombat movie, both of which are influences for this SP movie..1. Donnie Darko = 5 star2. Mortal Kombat = 1 starThus the 3 star rating...Ok film..."
3,not for the theater,"the movie is ok, i bought more as a gift than for me, i'm more in to different kind of movies..."
5,The seventh viewing,"I loved this film. I was in love with it the moment the opening song ripped open my eardrums, and put inside them glory. I've seen this film 7 times now, having watched in in theatres and on demand multiple times. This, however, was better than the rest. The blu-ray had all the little odds and ends a seventh viewing needed. I recommend this to all who love game and nerd references in general, as well as music. XXXXX out of 5 XXXXX"
3,"Scott Pilgrim fans love this, but I...","I thought is was just alright. There were many parts that I liked, and many parts that I didn't care for. Would I tell you to watch it? Yes. Would I recommend owning it? Not unless you liked it the first time."
2,No Special Features!!!!,"I love this movie, but the one i bought was a rented version, so it didn't have any of the special features. :("
1,It really deserves 0 stars,"This is evidence that anyone can have a singing career if enough money is spent promoting it to the correct target audience; teenage girls. He can't sing, the songs are embarassingly stupid and he was just another teenage idol for mindless little girls. I guess that's all harmless in a way, but to reissue this garbage on CD when many great musical works are difficult to find or out of print is scandalous. What an absolute waste of plastic."
5,"Highly ""educational""","As a reader of church history, with not a small amount of study on the subject, I find Van Wagoner a thorough and meticulous historian. While he seems to reveal his abhorance for how church leaders, and Joseph Smith, handled (lied, bullied, denigrated others) things in this regard, so do I. And, it is hard not to when learning about such bad behavior on the part of men you have been taught to revere (and have been inappropriately raised to Mount Olympus heights) by so-called ""faithful history.""So, I recommend it to open-minded Mormons. I don't care what non-Mormons think--they don't have sufficient contextual understanding of the Mormon sub-culture."
1,Anti-LDS,"I considered the content of this book to be very anti-LDS. The author said that he was just stating facts, but he quoted a lot of ""hear-say"" rumors. He spent a large portion of the book slandering the Prophet Joseph Smith. If someone is looking for an anti-LDS book, I believe they will enjoy this one. But if they are looking for an honest history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints, I would say to keep on looking. For a book that presents both sides, yet doesn't get sleazy, I would suggest ""The Bible & Polygamy, Does the Bible Sanction Polygamy?"" It is published by Archive Publishers in Grantsville, Utah."
3,Not sure what to think,I didn't realize how meaty these meals are until I got the package. My mistake. The cardboard on the box was very worn down and it appeared the box had been shipped around the world a few times. Kinda gives me an uneasy feeling about the authenticity or freshness of these meals. I bought them as emergency food so I hope I never have to use them anyway.
2,Falls apart soon,"This ball sprung a leak after a couple of days outside (and really, balls aren't inside toys). Very disappointed and do not recommend."
2,Shiney Cross Necklace is a huge disappointment,"I ordered this for my daughters 16th birthday. It is described as 1 inch which would have been the perfect size. However, it is not 1 inch but almost 3/4 of an inch. It is less than 1/2 inch wide even though it is described as 1 inch wide. It looks like something for a small child. I have learned my lesson and will never order from this company again. My daughter has a lot of health concerns and this was supposed to be a special gift for her. This is my most disappointing order of this holiday season. Glad I did not order the chain from this company!!!"
5,Blue's Clues Party Plate,"This is a great product. It shipped fast and arrived as described, the plates were perfect for use with cake and ice cream."
3,Better for WP Suite 8 instead of WordPerfect Office 2000,"I initially thought about getting this book because it did seem in between too-easy and too-hard. But I am very familiar with the WordPerfect products and wanted detailed coverage of the new products (like Trellix 2 which replaces the ""web site builder"" mentioned on book cover and the above publisher's description). You would think ""official"" means corel would let authors know what products actually comprised their Office 2000. If you have Suite 8, this book would do nicely. Fails miserably for WP Office 2000."
2,It's cheap. You can do better for a few more bucks.,"It's about the size of a grade-school workbook. The pictures are confusing and need a bit of interpretation to clarify what the author is getting at.As an experienced paper folder, I found the designs and the instructions lacking.As to the beginners perspective, for entertainment on a long train ride with my younger brother, I brought this book and another geometric origami book ""Unit Origami"" by Tomoko Fuse.My brother was a complete novice. He first attempted a few projects from ""3-D Geometric Origami : Modular Polyhedra."" He seemed a bit discouraged through the whole process, however, we were pretty bored so he attempted to complete few anyway. The finished products didn't hold up very well and they didn't look very pretty either.He was about to give up on origami altogether. I handed him the Unit Origami book, and he took off. He was an origami folding fanatic for the whole week we were staying with our relatives."
3,fake market place made to confuse consumers,"The whole point here was that two guys who are in film school create the ultimate hoax using monies from a gov't grant to fool people into going to a shoppingmarket that isn't there. the idea behind this is good but where i think they lost footing was that they created ads w/ real low prices on them so that people would be desperate to go there. If they puto out an ad w/ only pix and no prices I thought that would have proved their purpose alot better. Seeing footage of eldely and handicapped people trugging through a meadow to a fake place isn't exactly a funny moment. The other reviewer here is correct that this seemed to have really stirred up a whole seperate incident of commoners arguing among eachother about ""joining the EU or not"" where if you're an outsider to the scene you aren't quite sure what all the anger is about. A great idea that had lots of thought but not much explanation."
3,Not bad.. I like Czech movies - but Amazon could offer better,"I purchased this DVD from a seller in Canada. I added it to a list of several others - not really knowing what I was getting here. It does give you insight on the Czech political/economic scene, but for actual entertainment value, there are better Czech movies.My real purpose for watching Czech movies is to learn the langguage better. It is especially helpful when you can watch with subtitles in both Czech and English. This film has both. This is not a movie I would watch over and over, though. Noc na Karlstejne and others are better suited for that."
5,A big improvemnt over OEM,the original design for the 1995 chevys was flawed. this new design will last much longer.
2,Dissapointed,"I picked up this book because I have a friend who is dealing with having MS. I thought this book was going to be about a woman's journey in being diagnosed and then learning how to deal with it. It does do that and there are some positive aspects. Her accepting of herself and of her family and her growth in faith.However, once I hit the middle of the book it became about the medicinal marijuana use. There is also a man, who is in pain and deliberately overdoses his pain medicine and commits suicide. These things are dealt with in a flippant and superficial manner.The positive does not outway the negative and therefore I cannot reccomend this book. I thought that it might be helpful to my friend and I would tell her about it. I most certainly won't now."
4,Nice Pearl!,Purchased this pearl in replacement of the oval one I previously ordered from this company. Both pearls were equally nice and dark in color. I chose to keep the round one because the wife preferred it. I personally thought the oval was prettier but what do I know :).This seller ships fast and sells great looking pearls! Recommended!
2,Yawn...,"Tiresome, when will it be over with? Tiny, disjointed, boring snippets of a male's female perspective mixed up with a lot of ""art"" name dropping, sexual innuendos, and posturing. I found it impossible to keep my place on the page from one stint to the next. It has interesting ideas that might make you think, but as a whole... zzzzzzzzz."
1,This is a 0 star item,This was more trouble than it was worth. The instructions have you soaking the rice for 30 minutes before starting the cooking process!!!!How stupid is that.
2,Not that great,"I don't think these dvd's are that great. I'm not sure if I just don't like Mari Winsor, or if I don't like pilates, but I bought these dvd's and only used them a few times before I lost interest. Some of the moves aren't that easy and others don't seem to do anything at all. I plan to stick with TaiBo."
4,Good for beginners. Too slow for intermediate or advance.,"I would rate this 4-5 stars FOR BEGINNERS, but 2 stars for more advanced users. What's commendable about this video is that she really takes time to EXPLAIN HOW TO PROPERLY DO EACH MOVE, and she gives good advice to how to modify the move for people who are not as strong or have bad backs. It really makes a beginner not feel lost in terms of how to coordinate the new motions. However, for anyone who is beyond the absolute beginner level, this tape is VERY BORING FOR MORE ADVANCED USERS because more than half workout time is spent listening to her talk about how to do each move, rather than just doing the moves; even after the 1-hour workout I felt like I only did 15minutes of exercise, so it was a waste of my time. (For intermediate level users I would recommend other videos, such as Ana Caban's video which goes through more moves at a not-rushed paced but without the dead time in between each move.)"
3,Not Thrilled,"After seeing the Winsor Pilates infomercials on TV and trying Winsor's previous videos, I thought this could be a good 3 DVD set. Daisy Fuentes is attractive, but I'm old enough to remember that commercial ""Where's the beef?"" That's kind of how I felt. These 'eye candy' DVDs are professionally made but I didn't get the best workout."
5,Pilates DVDs,"I bought both a new and a used set of the Winsor Pilates DVD's. Both arrived quickly and in good condition. Although I have not yet used them as I still have my original tapes, all appears to be in order."
3,Where are the wheels?,"I wrote a review 2weeks ago, and have not heard anything back yet. I don't know where else on the website to make a complaint regarding missing pieces on an order. I love the cart, but the wheels were not in the box, and I would like my wheels. I wouldn't complain but I have copd and mobility issues. I ordered this cart because it specified it came with the wheels.Anyone have any suggestions? I can't find anywhere it says what size or type of wheels anyway, if you had to replace them."
4,Great Tshirt & underwear drawers $18.97 at WalMart,"These work great for light weight storage. My son has a small room and has this in his closet for his socks, tank tops and underwear. And my daughter has 2 of them to use for all her Tshirts which she loves because she can see through them to tell which color tshirt she wants to grab without digging through all the drawers. I'm an Amazon regular shopper, but these are only $18.97 at WalMart or $22.99 at Target."
5,Great storage,Great storage space. I use it to keep my snackage in. You can't put anything too heavy in it though. And definitely don't put anything too heavy on the top. It causes it to collapse in.
4,Good storage,"I use this for storing my clothes. I had a previous one and needed more storage, so I bought this online. I have the two stacked which works, except I don't know if they are meant to be stacked. I know some other plastic storage containers sort of interlock when stacked (due to the design) but these aren't like that. Not that it matters but it would make the units more stable for stacking. It's cheap but functional and lightweight."
4,Great storage,"Great product. Size is perfect, my only complaint is that the drawers are a little thin. I was expecting a sturdier plastic for the drawers based on other Sterlite products I have purchased."
1,streilite drawer disappointment,"I bought this item to store craft supplies. Unfortunately, the drawers aren't strong enough to support the weight that the size allows. I don't think it can function with anything heavier than socks. The top is not reinforced so if you place anything on it, it soon warps which prevents the top drawer from closing."
3,Disappointed,"Got this last week and I have to say that I am a little disappointed. The plastic is pretty thin. I put some stuff on the top of it (nothing heavy) and it is now warped, and the top drawer will not close properly. The side of the top drawer is already a little broken.Overall, it is a decent product if you don't put anything too heavy in it or on top of it. The only reason I got this was because of portability- the unit is very light and comes with wheels. I don't think it's worth the $16 I paid for it though."
3,It's OK,But smaller than I imagined. Drawers won't accommodate a gallon of paint. Not deep enough. But OK for smaller items; perhaps an office situation. Wheels are kind of a joke since it won't be holding much weight. Just as easy to slide or lift by hand.Update: I moved it inside for lighter duty service. The wheels perhaps slightly more functional in this situation.
2,broken during shipping,i received it to give as a gift on my sister's special daybut was dissappionted to see its broken handlei returned it immediately saying that iam refusing the shipmentit doesnot look as sturdy as it looks in picturei willn't recommend it
3,review,My son begged me to purchase this show. It was interesting & a bit amusing since zombies & vampires dont actuallyexist. I was disappointedthat as a member of Amazon Prime that this & other episodes we not available for free.Save your money watch on Netflix
5,"great show, very funny.","I loved this first season. It is very funny, and still clean enough for children to watch. I can't wait to see season 2."
5,Fun for everyone!,"This is a family film, and all ages will enjoy the show. The humor is witty. The characters are cute. The situations are impossible, yet intriguing. It is fun for everyone -- Grandma and Grandpa, mom and dad, and kids of any age."
2,Wait for the WIDE frame version!,"If you have already watched this show before on TV then I WOULDN'T reccommend this FULL FRAME version. You'll loose 30% of the details of the show because you know what to expect. If this is your FIRST TIME viewing it, it'll be alright BUT I'd still rather reccommend the WIDE SCREEN version"
4,"Great Book, but a little preachy at the end.","This was the first book I ordered for my kindle because the holocaust era/subject intrigue yet sadden me. I was very happy with the book, but if you're someone who isn't a very religious person, the book about three quarters of the way in gets very preachy and the repeatedness of it all got a little wearing. I applaud the author though, the story line, plots and characters were all greatly formed and seen through in a nice manner. I was a little disappointed the secret of Peter held from Helene of who her father really was didn't come out...or so I think it didn't haha, I could have missed it."
4,An Up and Comer!,"Tricia Goyer, an up and coming Christian writer, explores a difficult and intriguing situation in this book--who were the women who stood by the Nazis as they murdered millions? Why? What were they feeling, dreaming, experiencing? She has done a great job with characterization, making me feel as if I know these people. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel that took me to a different place and time, and know I'll be looking for more of Tricia's work in the future."
2,broke out my toddler,"i had been using great lakes brand and could not get from amazon when i needed so i thought i would try since it is suppose to be the ""best"" kosher gelatin and more $$$ than great lakes. however within a day of my toddler eating gelatin made with this brand, she was inflamed and broke out. she has a lot of allergies so however they process their gelatin is different enough to create an allergic reaction to her. it may be a great product for some people but not for me. it did have a grainer and darker texture to it than great lakes."
4,Good gelatine,"This is a good gelatine with no flavor whatsoever, so it can be used to gel anything. I dissolve a tablespoon of gelatine in juice or tea daily because it helps my joints. But I also use it to make gelatine desserts, fortify soups and stews, and in aspics.This brand isn't as fine a gelatine as I've had, but the quality is very good. I've got no complaints."
3,Famous Authors - Voltaire,The video was worth watching but for the price it could have been more video and less still shots. The same pictures were shown many times with a narrative. I thought that less time could be spent on descriptions of Voltaire's acquaintances and more time spent on Voltaire himself. I would have liked to see more scenes of Fernie and his previous homes and less time on the still shots of him that are readily available on an internet search. There was not a very thorough deception of any of his writings. I'm glad I bought it only because it is the only video I found about him.
5,Beautiful Advent Music,"This CD contains a wonderful blend of traditional and unusual music to celebrate Advent, which capitalizes on multi-ethnic genres. It is a welcomed addition to my Christmas favorites."
5,I loved this book,"I must say young lady, you are a wonderful writer. I cried, laughed, and nodded my head throughout the whole story. It is real and right in your face. You have a fan in me. If I could afford it, I would buy all of your books in print right now. I look forward to reading your next novel. I just wanted to let you know that I think you destined for greatness and you will be very successful in whatever you put your mind to. Keep up the good work!"
5,An awesome beginning,"I read Flipside of the game and its sequel right behind each other. I truly enjoyed both books. Flipside is a book that is clean but gritty. Its characters have a lot of love, but loathing as well. It shows the flip side of the game, the consequences as well as the rewards. This book is full of seriousness as well as humor. I enjoyed reading about Vera and Taj, the doctor that I am sure everyone wishes really does exist. Aunt Cookie and Uncle Boy were off da chain and those devious girlfriends could be sweet or shiesty; depending on the time of the day. The midget had me rolling and my heart went out to Rowanda. We can be victims by birth rights. However, there are always a way to change things, except for the past. I truly enjoyed this book and can't wait to read more by this author."
4,Better Than I Thought,"I got this book from the library and had very low expectations. It was surprisingly much better than I thought after, I disregarded the immature and emotionally damaged main character I was able to focus. I also thought the book was funny as hell!I did like the points that the writer made. It's very important to realize that the past holds many people back. There are many adults who have issues that happened to them during childhood that effect the decisions they make in life because they just cannot resolve the pain inside. The main character definitely was the epitome of this sentiment. It didn't seem that she wanted to move on from her past but kept living in it. If this is Tu-Shonda's first book she did a pretty good job."
3,a women tearjerker!,"im usually not into these type of movies, but if your going to grow up to be a movie critic you have to have see and comment on several different movies.my mom was actually the one that rented it, but she asked me to watch it with her, so i did.and i was amazed. i actually liked it, it was sad and my mom cried at the end,but i liked it."
3,STREEP IS OUTSTANDING!,"I just rented this movie last night.. Meryl Streep is an amazing actress..and William Hurt was excellent as the ""not there"" husband.. it was sad but for me , it wasn't a tearjerker.. you knew what was going to happen in the end...i was unsatisfied with the ending.there was some questions that were never answered.. all in all, i would recommend this movie..."
5,Amazing! Meryl Streep soars!,"One True Thing based on the bestselling novel tells the story of a hard working & determined mother who has fallen ill with cancer (Meryl Streep). The plot is based around the discoveries her daughter makes (Renee Zellweger) about her family, and realizes that the world her family lived in so many years ago was not as happy as it seemed. The daughter has clearly favored her father over her mother for as long as she could remember, and never treated her mother fairly or appriciated anything she did for her. Zellweger's character discovers the dark secrets of her fathers sexual affairs and his massive drinking problems, and at the end of her mother's life realizes just how badly her father had treated her. The movie is very well done (unfortunatley it was greatly overlooked). The movie is ultimatley depressing, but tells an extreamly powerful story and effective in its delivery."
3,"Good, solid B-movie fun.","Razorback is arguably the greatest film ever made about a giant,wild,smart,killer pig with a taste for human flesh.Arguably.All kidding aside if you like horror movies about monster animals with a cool tongue-in-cheek attitude, but with some truly exciting moments (think Alligator)I believe you will get a kick out of this flick.The movie was obviously made on the cheap,but with talent and imagination much like another incredible Australian indie Mad Max."
2,Nothing new stilling ideas,Just still idea from other book the book that I actually was lookingis by for and i got this by mistake
3,KEEPING THE FAT OFF!,"I have followed the Montignac Method for over ten years because the diet works. I ordered THE FRENCH DIET from Amazon.com because I know that each new Montignac book contains something new something to make the diet even more useful to me. Here is what I picked up from the new book. How to incorporate the Glycaemic Load concept into the Glycaemic Index for fine tuning Montignac's original Gi Diet. Next I learned about the GO concept because it is a great help to handle discrepancies i.e., how to combine no so healthy carbohydrates with the healthier ones.I think THE FRENCH DIET is Montignac's best Gi Diet book ever. It is the easiest presentation and therefore a snap to understand and follow the principles of the diet. Lastly, it also is the most precise and shortest Montignac diet book yet which is a blessing.Ernest Hilton"
4,Better than Iridion 3D,You'll love this game! You get to select your weapon and skill level. It's alot of fun and the graphics are amazing. You have a smart bomb and a super shot as your super weapons. If you buy this game you won't regret it!
3,Good & effective,"Clear & concise.Not too many blah blah pages.Some essential pages to explain the basics.Exercises with pictures alongide.Clear programme charting.Quite effective, when done correctly...I saw this book first in the 90s with a frien.. bought it 2 years and have used it with satisfactory results"
2,Trackball,This was in fact a great deal larger than I imagined from the picture. I returned it as I had purchased for use with my laptop. A small trackball for laptops would be a great addition to the product line.
1,Poor produt for Logitech !!!,Product is terrible as precision goes!Mouse Setup Software is unpredictable and non-responding!Also mouse wheel rubes on housing!Surprising bad product coming from a quality manufacturer such as Logitech!
2,Nice design but does not stay linked - do not buy,I bought two of these and they do not stay linked with the pc. I am constantly reconnecting them to the computer. I have to keep my old mouse nearby just so I can restart my computer. They go through batteries faster than any other cordless mouse I've ever had. It has a great look and feel but its functionality is not anything to be relied upon. Also the software is bad. I have to reprogram the buttons on every restart. I am going to return this and get a more expensive but ultimately much more reliable bluetooth mouse.
4,great trakball,"I have had my Logitek Cordless Optical Trackman for several years now until it recently gave out on me. And to my surprise the trackman now in the local stores is the old ones with the cord attachment. ok yes there are some that say this is not a true cordless since it has an attachment that comes with it for the sensor, but i can move my mouse around a good 8-10 feet away from the computer base with ease. I do have to have a pad with a wristrest on it tho, without it my hand gets some fatigue. but not as bad as using a mouse. The programmable buttons and scroll wheel (and scrollup/down buttons) make clicking things a breeze."
3,not for truck drivers,"The mouse has lots of good features but the left click does not work well and the ball is too quick (sensitive?)to use in truck. When we are driving down the road the vibration just makes the curser go nuts makeing it imposible to click points on a map or other fine details. This may be adjustable but we haven't taken the time to check it out,went back to our corded Microsoft trackmouse."
3,BIG trackball!!,"I bought this because I'd had a similar wired trackball. I'm getting used to it but it's much bigger than my old one, maybe a little too big. It works fine and has some nice features so maybe I'll get used to it. If you have small hands this would not be the trackball for you."
5,I used to be a standard mouse user...NOT ANY MORE,"I just recently got into Digital Scrapbooking and in order for me to spend optimal time with my husband and be able to scrapbook this mouse was an absolute have to have. I can now sit on the couch next to my husband as he watches TV (which is his favorite past time) and I could get my things done without having to have a space next to me to roll a mouse around. It took me a bit to get used to it, but now that I have I absolutely love it. Ordered one for work also..........LOVE IT......Highly recommend it."
4,Takes getting use 2!,"I have ordered several times through Amazon...I am pleased with the speedy delivery and I am getting use to my new Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman mouse. It takes a bit to get use to it! I had an older model trackball from logitech (it was a corded one which I see is still being sold!)and I loved using that one. The marble ball on this mouse seems at first a bit slow and didn't respond as I would have liked when I turned it on...but then I went into the mouse settings and re-adjusted things and it is working GREAT! I am not sure how this compares to the other trackball mice out there, but I like this one!"
2,"I love Logitech, I hate the Trackman","I had this ordered for me to replace my standard issue mouse when I couldn't find the older model thumb controlled track ball through my office's suppliers. I used it for about a week, and then had it shipped back. It caused severe hand pain and cramps if I used it for more than a half hour or so. I assumed that it was just because I needed to get used to the new finger tip controls. My hand never adjusted to having to crane my fingers up to use it. Hence the pain that this device caused was worse than that of the mouse I was trying to replace.The cordless feature seems like a great idea, at least at first. But this is a trackball... it doesn't need to move around your desktop. So unless your CPU is really far away from your desktop, save yourself a few bucks and get a wired model."
2,"Microsoft Trackball Explorer Replacement, Not!",Microsoft stopped making the Trackball Explorer mouse which in my opinion was the best trackball mouse ever made. They are still available on EBay but at $150 a pop. I went to XP 64 bit and the Microsoft mouse drivers have a major bug which cause my computer to get the BSOD so off to finally finding a replacement (my old Trackball Explorers went to EBay).First let me say that this in not even close to a replacement for the Microsoft's Trackball explorer but it was probably never meant to me. I gave it a full week's try but my brain had a hard time adjusting. The layout is not natural for me. I could not lay my hand on it natural and be productive. I had to move my hand up on the mouse and cramp my fingers to make it work but that was not comfortable.I ended up with the Logitech Trackman Wheel. It has taken me a while to retrain my brain but my hand lays natural on it and works fine plus it is about 1/2 the price.
5,Purchasing Agent,"I have always loved the trackballs. I have carpel tunnel (spelling) and the original trackball really helped. While this one is a little higher in height, and the ball is slower, everything else about it is great. Nice addition of buttons to program."
1,Tired of chasing it.,After chasing this trackball all over my desk (3 tiny rubber pieces is supposed to keep it stationary)it stopped functioning on the 3rd day. I am returning it. I will be glad I no longer have to place the chasing game.
2,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman,The unit screwed up my computer something horrible. I ended up trashing the thing
1,Does not fit my hand,"My son has a Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman & uses it as a back up to a corded mouse. He likes it but when I go one and tried it, I kept scooting it along the Keyboard pull-out table. The Logitech cordless trackball works much better for me."
2,"The fact that I have to click with my thum, is very un-comfertable. I regret the purchase.",I had Logitech's trackman wheel mouse and I loved it. I debated between the two but based of my goog experience with them I ordered this one.I'm not happy.The fact that the click is done with the thum is a mistake in my opinion.
4,A bit overpriced,"This is the only cordless trackball I could find, compared to the cordless mouse it is overpriced as are all trackballs. It works well, may be a little touchy at times and is slower when the computer is downloading something."
5,wow,"Love it, I would like to say great item but theyre is a slight delay in movement great for point click but not auto cad. unless that delay can be corrected. A"
3,Almost but not quite perfect,"As close as I've found to right for a trackball with a wheel for CAD work. Personally, the buttons and wheels are to far from the ball for use without actually moving my hand but I've got short, fat hands so it could just be me. It's the best I've found so far but I'll keep looking.And........ Please ...... make it corded. Wireless on a trackball is just unnecessary."
4,Everything except ...,"I really like this mouse. It is comfortable in my hand. And if I can memorize all of the buttons it will be even better for my wrist. The one thing I didn't expect was the dongle usb device. It is not very convenient, especially on a laptop, and especially if you use your laptop on your lap. I guess I was expecting one of those little ubs nubs that my other wireless mouse had. So far that is my only real complaint."
5,Awesome!!!,"bought specifically for playing world of warcraft.love the extra buttons. in fact, this is my second in 3 years. first one died, because the 'antenna' part got stuck in a recliner. batteries last a good two weeks with near constant use - over 15 hrs a day between work and play on my laptop. nothing else compares."
1,Slow As Molasses,I just purchased a brand new Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman and what a piece of poor quality. I have used a rollerball mouse for years and my other one just died...so I read reviews and purchased the Trackman. Slower than molasses...the rollerball will not move up and down and it feels like it drags when I try to move it from side to side. Back it goes to Amazon and I will keep looking....I miss my rollerball mouse!!!
3,What a ball!,"This is a great track ball, once you get used to the awkward button configurations. Especially useful on a small or crowded desk when space is scarce. I've had mine for several months now and never a problem."
1,Don't waste your money,"Today's date 4/5/12. I have used Logitech for years and all have been track ball because I hate moving a mouse all over the desk. I got this in Nov 2011 and should have sent it back but I didn't. The reviews that talk about small buttons and awkward position and stiff buttons are all correct. But I was willing to live with it to have a trackball. I also found that I had to spin the ball more than I would have like to travel across the screen. But that aside it quite last week, I put new batteries in it still would not work so I got another set out and put them in, still won't work. I need to see what the warranty is and get it sent in for repair if it is still in warranty. I am starting to wonder about Logitech quality. I love track balls and would like to find a programmable one that is for office work. Were I can program buttons for cut and paste and things like that. Thanks for your time. Good luck on finding the perfect mouse for you needs."
5,I LOVE it.,"...it's wireless. it's got lots of buttons. it uses the index or other fingers for the track ball as opposed to the thumb. trying a thumb ball I felt awkward. probably I would have learned, but: my friend who did CAD design for years told me I did very well because in his opinion/experience a thumb ball will destroy your hand (RSI). if you try this one or one like it, one refinement I figured out is switch the left and right mouse buttons in your control panel. that way the right (primary) click is your middle or ring finger and you can hold the unit in your right hand with your thumb underneath and still click. some reviewers complain that the ball gets gummed up too fast. in my experience there are two solutions: clean it often (poke the ball out and rub the sensors--takes 2 seconds); or never clean it--if it gets slow, press hard and roll it a bit and it will acclimate itself. (I generally dont' clean it for weeks at a time...)"
4,A bit awkward for me,"It does everything is said it would do. I was very impress how easy was to give each button (and it has many) a particular task, totally customizable. This mouse with my hand on top of it would not fit on my sliding keyboard shelf when the shelf is under the desk top (which is the way I use it when playing games and I don't need the keyboard),it seats higher than a side mounted trackball mouse. So for that reason I chose to return it, but since I threw the packaging away, I'm listing it on eBay."
5,The Best Mouse,"The Logitech mouse is everything that I expected it to be. The track ball is easy to use- no sliding a mouse around. Sit still and let the trackman do the work for you. A wheel on top allows you to slow scroll through a document without moving your whole hand. Two buttons on each side of the wheel allow you to fast scroll a document up or down.Above the left-click are two more buttons for the internet that allow you to page forward or back on the internet. It is WIRELESS!!!! I love it. As a matter of fact, I may buy a second one to have before they do something crazy like discontinue it!"
4,Best thing available at time of purchase,"This is a quality product and Logitech make excellent trackballs. The only reason I bought this technology was because I could not find a bluetooth trackball. I have a bluetooth keyboard and it is much more responsive and you don't have to worry about roving too far from your computer or where the signal receiver is. Having said all that, this is a great option for a desktop computer. For a laptop its kind of a hassle."
1,TOO BIG !,"I have had a Logitech TrackMan Live for at least8 years . And it has its' share of problems .But the new TrackMan is not a good replacement.1. It is too big...the whole idea behind a cordlesstrackball (for me) is to sit back in my chair,hold this thing like a TV remote,and use it offthe table. You need both hands to handle this one!!2. Setup is easy and simple, and there are controlsfor speed and button assignment.3. The ball feels clumsy and cheap.4. Its' difficult to move without pressing a button,button location is bad,unless you use it on the table."
1,Please Please Read this,"This is a terrible mistake, all the functions are designated to the wrong fingers, and they are not naturally gifted with that dexterity. Nor are they likely to be able to adapt. Your middle finger or first finger are adapted to going up and down moving a wheel is logical, but not side to side on a ball. Your thumb, for most human like animals has the most motion dexterity and it is not even used here. I disagree totally with another TrackBall comment; the middle finger is far far over worked here and is not capable. Study the motion and evolution of the hand, the thumb is the progress of apes, the other fingers grab and make a fist the thumb works. I Have all of 5 or six warn out TrakBalls in my drawer, this is a problem with them, they ware out and bind. I tried this one for about two weeks exclusively every day, but could not get any speed out of it. I love track balls and can work easily faster with them."
1,Poor connectivity,Doing everything the product recommended failed to get the thing to work. I'm set up successfully otherwise on a network.
4,not good,I like this item but its very hard to fit her feet into her skies.the gloves do not fit on her hand propoly and the colours do not suit her slightly pink tone. As a fashion expert I would think SASHA is the most fashionable.
5,Sweet!!,"This doll is just so cute. Yasmin's all decked out and ready to go skiing with her friends. She comes with a light pink coat w/ fur accents, a white turtleneck sweater w/ a sparkly snowflake(on the front), blue pants w/ a light pink fur hem, pink boots, and a pink hat. The second outfit is a blue turtleneck sweater, a pink vest, a beige mini skirt, pink tights, blue boots, a brown striped scarf w/ matching gloves, and light pink earmuffs.She comes w/ 2 bags. A blue backpack and a tan oversized bag. She comes with a blue mug w/ pretend hot cocoa inside. And she also comes with tons of accesories including a cellphone. Yasmin also comes with a cute pink monkey keychain. Oh and let's not forget the ski gear. This Yasmin looks sweet in all of her outfits. I really reccomend her.Bratz RulezPeace OutBabygirl"
5,classic,"As a jazz player, there is no more classic sound then the fiberglass straight mute. Though having a metal mute is recommended for other work, I have the cup, bucket, and straight mute in the Humes and Berg line, and they all work great! Highly recommended."
3,Hit or Miss,Apparently Ethan Black is a hit or miss kind of author and unfortunately this was a miss for me. Conrad Voort is from the first family of police investigators in NYC. A serial killer has decided that Voort is the reason why his life has gone from perfect to victim. The killer has planned 4 murders before midnight and leaves a note at each site that only Voort understands.
5,VOORT'S BACK,"I really have become quite fond of Conrad Voort, the hero of Ethan Black's novels. He's a rich cop, sure, but he has strong family and moral values, and he still goes to church and prays to God for assistance.Six years ago, Voort did something to really tick somebody off, cause now they're killing people and leaving notes that blame Voort. His superiors want to know what Voort did and why this killer is accusing him.Wendell Nye, the villain of the piece, is one strange dude, and even when you find out what happened to him those six years ago, it still doesn't seem to justify his actions. Even though his victims are villainous in their own right.However, the book moves extremely well, and the climax is quite good. Poor Voort..he now has his widowed sister-in-law after him, and he's reconciled with Camilla. Their bantering is a humorous respite in the murderous atmosphere.A very good novel. Enjoy!RECOMMENDED."
1,disappointed,"The camcorder came from the manufacturer, broken....and the company I purchased it from, was not customer friendly....as of today, I am still waiting for it to be fixed."
3,The Ogs Learn ToFloat,This book is aobut a family of cavepeople. One morning it rains a huge flood and all their stuff goes out the door but when grandma jumps in after she gets swept away by the curents. The whole family trys to find whys to get to her.You will love the crazy ways they try to save their grandma.It is written by Felicity Everett. Just like her other books this one will be fun for you to read when your children are having trouble sleeping.
5,"Baby Its Alright... hey, hey, hey","Few, legendary recording artist are in a league all their own and indistinguishable by only their voice. Unlike other legends, Ray Charles sang and performed all categories of music to perfection. One unique man. One unique style. One unique voice, and he sang it all with indistinguishable perfection.I was conceived because my mother was the girl with the red dress on. She was hotly pursued by my dad, while they did the Bird Land all night long. Its Alright, hey, hey, hey... tell me what I say...Country Road take Ray Home"
4,Not too bad,"I got the package on time, but the case was all busted. I was only worried about the actual cd itself. The cd is mint so oh well. :) Its great."
2,"Okay concept, poor execution","I admit I love horror movies and also admit I am willing to accept some less-than-professional productions along with suspension of disbelief to get my spine tingling. That's the point: I can forgive a lot if it scares me. It's the same with comedy, it it makes me laugh, that's the bottom line. A HORRIBLE WAY TO DIE wasn't scary; it was dull. Kudos for some good character development, but the story lacked the necessary suspense to draw me in. And, as so many others have mentioned, the cinematography was so amateurish it pulled me right out of the story--distracting."
1,Awful,"I read Ms. Putnam's book, ""Never trust a Rake"" and thought that it was without question, one of the worst books I have ever read. This follows right behind and I shall not bother reading another of her books again! This was a romance with zero chemistry and not very likeable characters. Adrian, the Duke of Trent, was weirdly cold. Sad childhood sort of thing. Emmaline is desperate for money and hires herself out as a matchmaker. A man who just hired her dies on her front step and the government asks Adrian to investiage as this man was a spy. So he pretends he needs her services to find a bride. The story does not work because of a) no chemistry and b) how could there be chemistry with a man who gets out of bed each morning and steps into ice water? Even when the reader finds out why he thinks he is so cold, in the end, it did not make sense or really explain his weird coldness. The sex? blah...In the end, who cared???"
2,It Sounded Good?!,"I don't know I guess that it was boring both characters really did not have anything in common and I did not really understand why the hero was ""tortured"" or why the heroine kept hurting both of them when they wanted each other and its kind of obvious that about the possiblity of the heros father I got that from the get go, but any way I found myself going in circles that I finished the book in half a day because I skipped a lot of parts. I know a book is good when I put it down because I don't want it to end. However I can never ever give an author anything less than a 2 because they worked so hard."
1,WORST Reference Book I've Ever Purchased,"Not only was this guide not helpful, it was agonizing to use. The index is incomplete, the maps are scattered and inapplicable, nothing is cross-referenced, and the descriptions are more often than not completely irrelevant. I've just returned from my trip to Mexico's Pacific Coast, and found that relying on the book for information was counter-productive, as many facts were missing or wrong. It was more productive to ask anyone than to open the book. Do not spend your money or time on this guide."
1,Where have all the good books gone?,"Within the context of academic standards, Paul Rout has produced a dismal failure. His style is opaque and his insights non-existant. Rout neither understands the intellectual and spiritual inheritance Bonaventure recieved from Francis nor does he ever grasp the depth and meaning these great Churchman have for the next millenium. His exposition on the mystical dimensions of Franciscan spirituality can only be described [and I am being quite charitable] as stupid. Where have all the good books gone?"
1,Intellectually Poor,"Paul Rout seems to miss the point in his 'popularist' exposition of Francis and Bonaventure. He fails to promote the essential message of these unique and profound thinkers. Perhaps this book may satisfy the 'common', 'average' and 'non-intellectual' reader but for the academic and scholarly minded reader it is mere 'clap-trap' with absolutely no critical analysis or scholarly merit."
1,Don't bother.,"I ordered this board the last of Feb. I installed it, but after less than 2 months it died, killing my equally new power supply with it. After 3 other power supplies met the same fate as the first, we realized it was the board. ECS will come up with anything to keep from honoring its warrenty. After 2 months of going back and forth all they will offer me is a refurbished board for $25. Save yourself trouble."
4,Beast Wars Transformers - The Complete Third Season,"i remember years ago when they had it on tv and all our kids just talk about, we ever got to see the end of the show.i give it a four star rating because i think the ending could have been longer. any how it was well worth the money, now i have all three season."
4,Great Game - Some Glitches,"This game has a lot of levels and situations that make it very fun and challenging. There are a few glitches that take this game down a notch. You're team member(s) will freeze on a location and they won't move. Bad guys have popped out of nowhere and killed me. These instances are rare and the game, overall, is very enjoyable."
5,SOCOM Navy Seals,EXTREMELY fun for teens over 14. Best 3rd person shooting game. Player becomes Navy Seals. Graphics are good for ps2.
4,best ps2 online,"get this game if you have a ps2 and online in the back, the new ps2's have a modem built in and it is free online. Freinds play in the living room and I play in my room so we can chill online chattin."
4,Playstation Game,This product is fun and challenging. I would recommend it to others to play. It came quickly for Christmas. I rated it 4 because it is a little difficult to finish a leve.
5,CoOoOoOoL,"Wow!Cloe is sooo cute and cool and i love how like all the wintertime wonderland bratz come with sweet winter accessories..awsome!! I am asking for em' all for Christmas this year and i TOTALLY can't wait!!! ALL the wintertime wonderland girl bratz i'm asking for. Cloe's cool, but my fave chick is Jade..yeah!! bye!"
1,oh my god,Is this Bratz doll actually wearing...CLOTHES? Believe it or not she's actually covered from head to toe. What a change from the the skimpy hooker clothes they usually wear.
4,"Fun, Fight, and More Fights","I loved this movie it was fun and action packed. You will like the martial arts fihgts and the ""LITTE"" heroe of this movie. You have to watch it to enjoy this move and see great and beautiful styles of fighting. Jacky is Great!"
4,Parenthood,"Watch the TV show Parenthood, which I love, and had never seen the movie. Fun to see who the tv version characters are based on. The movie is definitely more of a comedy then the tv show. Would recommend especially if you are from a larger family or have lots of kids."
1,"watch what ""region"" is listed.","I've never had this problem through Amazon before.. Apparently this DVD was meant to play in a completely different region than the one I am in. Needless to say, it doesn't work in my DVD player. I don't understand why a DVD shipped out of the US would not be able to be played in the US. Just seems a little too ""tricky"" to me."
3,"dated, but funny","This movie was required viewing material for my college psychology class. We viewed it as part of a unit on Family Dynamics.Some of the hair and wardrobe choices in this movie make it very dated, I believe it came out in the 80's.Of course I made my husband watch it with me. (If I have to suffer through school so does he!) Months later, we are still turning to eachother and quoting the part about Cowboy Dan, complete with huge cheesy grin.It's not something I would have chosen to buy, but for something I was assigned, it's not a bad choice."
5,I Love This Movie.,"I decided to give this movie to a couple of my family members who are parents as a gift this year. This is a very funny movie that shows how different one family can be, how people raise their kids and address their kids issues. The line up of actors is great and it is just an all around funny movie. A classic at this point in time."
5,Love it at any age!,"This film came out when I was still in High School. I absolutely loved it then. Now, as a parent, it make's me cry and laugh even harder. My parent's even love it from both parental and grandparent views. It has passed the generation and the evolution of one's self, test. I give it 5 stars for sure!"
5,interesting read,"I usually hate fantasy stories where the ""rightful"" ruler is portrayed as being good and kind, simply by virtue of their parentage. However, this book is so interesting, that I was willing to overlook that issue and enjoy the intersting plot twists. I reccomend this to anybody who enjoys fantasy and political intrigue."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I purchased this book based on the reviews that I had read. Overall it had reviewed well. After reading this book it was .... disappointing .... The writting style was annoying jumping here and there. Compeltly disjointed with no flow thru the story. The story itself was simplistic. Almost as if the author had followed a formula ""How to write a book in 30-days"". If you must have this book, save yourself the money and find it in a used bookstore. I am sure it will be there, as this is not a keeper."
5,Thoughts of a man being eaten alive,"Stuffing himself with 7000 calories of butter every day, and still he literally starving the death. Squashed up between his mates at night yet they're a million miles away. Haunted by so much death, and obviously intensely frightened of it, but he keeps slow killing himself by going to these terrible places. Alice in Wonderland wasn't as crazy as the trip this guy is on."
2,Not that great of a read,"I finally burned through this book seeing it to the end. Peter is a decent enough person who has led a difficult life. The tragic loss of his mother is obviously a heavy burden to bear and over rides a lot of this book, as is his father's giant presence and shadow. Essentially though the premise of the entire expedition was flawed by the bad judgement of not really knowing his companions - and going only with two others. In the world of expeditions - three is a bad number. I know from experience. Hillary seems to shrug off his responsibility here and puts it on the others. In general a mediocre book."
2,Trying to make the story do too many things.,"I personally thought this book was really depressing and simply written. For the sake of all those disappointed souls who will actually buy this book, I just have to say that Amazon has at least 1000 books in this genre that are much, much better.I suggest that this book does not reach expectations of the publisher's comments. I just didn't get into this so called adventure story - ghost story - psychological thriller; perhaps that's the author's problem. Trying to make it too many things at once and only slightly succeeding. I cannot recommend it with so many other greater choices available. I'm always suspect when I see only maximum star ratings in a row?"
4,pretty good...,"i really liked the story, and the gameplay was so easy to adapt to...replay ability isn't that good... and the graphics were not up to standerds... but i don't really care about graphics that much... i mean i still like the first tomb raider. the music is really good...and if you liked the movie, i would highly recommend you get this....plus the price isn't that bad."
4,Bigger than expected,"The size ot this beautiful dish is larger than I thought - but that's great as it will hold two side dishes for a small gathering well and take up less room on my smallish dining table. It""s lovely, however, note that it is thicker than plates, bowls, etc. and does not feel as much like china as I thought it would. This will make it more durable, but I was surprised by its weight. Just not the delicate piece I thought it was."
3,something's missing,While it's imperative that we teach our children about other cultures this book does not offer enough details to do that. It glosses over what makes these Native-Americans different from other tribes in the desert of the Southern United States and how their culture developed. It is too simple and does not ask the reader to take part in the experience.
5,Well worth the import price,"My first impression of this album was a good one, but as time went on it came to grow on me more and more. This is certainly one of the better Costes albums. The mixing is nothing revolutionary, but it is well done and all tracks flow into each other very well. The tracks feature some wonderful and unique house grooves. I've come to enjoy this album very much and consider it one of the best lounge albums in my collection."
4,wow,"This is very very impressive!Response is great, battery life is good.It is a bit bulky in the hands, but after several hours of using it you will get used to it."
1,Yabba-dabba-don't,"This little piece of lunacy is pure dinosaur doo-doo. It is neither interesting nor funny, largely because of the horribly lame script. The cast is also lacking. Moranis is dreadful (as usual), and O'Donnell is even worse. How this unattractive, annoying and grotesque non-actress could have been cast as Betty is beyond comprehension. Stick with the cartoons and avoid this piece of junk. P.U.!"
1,Slipping still slipping I slipped !,"This is a zzzzzz type of movie I mean what kind of brainless ... would put Rosie O' Donnell down as Betty I mean what is this Idotic Casting Zone and another thing John Goodman is no Fred I think he has done better and I think Pebbles should have been played by a YOUNGER Kids as too Bam Bam The baby that played Mary in Three Men And A Baby should have played Pebbles in my opion hey at least she was younger .I like the second one best ! The casting is right ,the music is terrfic ,and the casting is good here is what I have too say . Bye the second ... the first . Toodles !"
1,Just Blah,"The Secret Life of Bees was 100% better.Woman's mother cuts off finger. Woman goes to see mother. Meets monk. Has affair apparently (this got so boring I skipped it). In end, mother reveals (sort of) why she cut off finger. Really no excuse in my opinion.There were pages and pages of reminiscing about her childhood, and it just wasn't interesting or well-written. This is just another woman (artist) who can do whatever she wants whenever she pleases because her husband supports her. He even cooks her breakfast! Aren't there any books about real women who pay their own bills?"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"What a disappointment!! After her wonderful book, The Secret Life of Bees, this newest book from Monk Kidd is truly an unremarkable, boring, just plain silly book. I didn't even finish it. I was turned off almost immediately when the main female character (I can't even remember her name) is summoned to her mother's home because Mom just used a meat cleaver to chop off the end of one of her fingers. Sorry, not something I'm really wanting to read about. And then, to top it off, no pun intended, Mom does another finger later on. Skip this book!!"
1,this story has beenwritten at least 1000 times,"After reading and loving the wonderful ""Secret Life Of Bees"", I simply could not wait to read ""The Mermaids Chair"", fortunatley for me I did not waste time sitting in a comfy chair with tea but rather it occupied my time while driving across country, the Kansas scenery was more interesting and less predictable. If this is the best Monk KIdd can do after ""Bees"" then she should spare us all and quit now. My big questions are 1. How many times does this plot line need to be written and unfortunately published? 2. Why is it authors can come up with no other way for a middleaged women to ""find herself"" than to have an affair with an unavailabe man? Dissapointing? This book was a waste of the hopefully recycled paper it was printed on."
3,I was hoping for so much more!,"It may be because I absolutely loved ""The Secret Life of Bees,"" or maybe it was because I lived on a barrier island near Charleston for 20 years and left my long marriage at the age of 41 while my only child was in college, but I expected to completely relate to the main character in this book and was eager to read it. I found Jesse, however, to be thoroughly dislikable, shallow, and selfish. I kept thinking, ""No! Women don't fall in love with someone else so easily and with so little guilt!"" The writing, too, was a bit on the ""flowery"" side. Maybe because of my high expectations, I found this book to be a disappointment."
1,Disappointing,"I loved the Secret life of the bees, and so I thought I should read Sue's other popular book. I was very dissappointed. Jessie is sexually attracted to Whit. Sex is not love. Jessie betrays her husband and child, distroys the core family, not to mention Whit and how he can justify sex while being a MONK! She selfishly has no regard for the consequences of having sex with a monk after meeting him a couple of times when she is married and he has vows of celibacy! It would have been a better novel is they had struggled with their attraction toward each other and later in the book, decided to give up their previous vows, she divorced and he resigned. It turned into just one more trashy romance novel."
1,Disappointed,"I loved ""Secret Life of Bees"", but I could not get into this one. I even skipped to the movie and thought that was boring. Sorry Sue Monk Kidd, Bees was excellent, this one was too slow!"
4,The Mermaid Chair,"First...seller got book here in mint condition very, very quickly. Book was a bit sad. Setting was interesting, and characters were good. Plot a bit less so."
2,A Big Disappointment,"While browsing at my local bookstore, I came upon the display for this book. Having read 'The Secret Life of Bees' I eagerly snatched up a copy and happily handed over my money. I should have borrowed it from the library. The characters were shallow, the scenery bland, and the author has written a story that seems far fetched, and overall a huge disappointment."
2,What happened?,"What a disapointment. After loving ""The Secret Life of Bee's"" I jumped in and bought a hardbound copy of ""The Mermaid Chair"". After a couple chapters and not believing this was from the same author, I put it down for weeks. Finally, in an urge to finish one book before starting another, I decided to give it another try. I felt as if I was reading ""The Bridges of Madison County"" all over again, but without the heat or any real connection between the two lovers. Sue Monk Kidd explained on a talk show that the book was about a middle-aged woman finding herself. What a shame the story centered around the main character running from one man to the arms of another one for her answers. There's nothing new,challenging or thought provoking in such a weak story-line. I'll give her another try--- ""Bee's"" was that good. Leave the love stories for Harlequin."
1,The Mermaid Chair,I can't review this product because I never did receive the book. I have numerous messages to the company without any response. This is pitiful
2,yucky love story,"Someone on here posted that this book should not be read right after reading ""Bees""...and they were right. i think that is where I made my mistake in reading this book, but i dont think i would have liked it regardless. First off the characters are unbeivable and unlovable. the monk whit was really out there, i mean his wife dies and he becomes a monk??? what is up with that. I have known many people who have lost loved one and went through periods of total devastation, but not ONE considered becoming a monk or a nun...sooooooo lame. And Jessie is a not likable at all and comes across as a spoiled, bitchy women. The love story was not even that hot, i mean a married women sleeping with a monk and you would think the sex scenes would ahve been more passionate. None of the characters appealed to me and I watched 10 minuets of the liftime movie and was DONE with this story. P.S what was up with Kim Bassingers hair????"
1,dont bother!,"A total waste of time reading this!After The Secret Life Of Bees I was expecting another wonderful,touching book.What happened,Sue Monk Kidd??This book read like a trashy drugstore romance novel!susan catudal,Montreal"
1,So disappointing,"6 chapters and I had to give it up.Something tells me though if you like Danielle Steele, you'll like this book."
1,The Mermaid Chair,"Truly awful! I feel very ripped off, even though I got this at the library. The waste of valuable living time is why. Have read very few books that are so insulting to the reader, or marketed under such false pretenses. It's a few rungs below a harlequin romance, with cliched and boring characters, a plot (and sub-plots) of maximum implausibility, and jarring little dabs of ersatz celtic mysticism apparently thrown in for marketing effect.The cover art is very pretty."
2,Woefully disappointing,"I had SUCH high hopes, only to find a book that is nothing but middle-aged chick lit. The only reason this is two stars rather than one, is that Ms. Monk Kidds' descriptions of the island are really lovely. Otherwise, it is the same anguished blah-blah of so many other novels. Give the main character (whose name escapes me, only one day after finishing the book!) a prescription for zoloft and hormone replacement therapy and move on."
2,Disappointing,"Not nearly as satisfying as ""Secret Life of Bees"". I found the main character vapid and annoying. However, the plot development and final revelation was interesting."
1,Hackneyed,"Reading this author's The Secret Life of Bees left me with high hopes for this novel. This book was dreadful, with a hackneyed plot, nearly uniformly weaker writing, utterly unbelievable and unsympathetic characters, and a disturbing message that has been much better delivered by numerous less promising authors. Almost every single ""surprise"" element of the leading character's less-than-convincing journey was telegraphed from the first pages. A terrible disappointment."
1,worse than the first book,"I only ready this as it was picked by my book club. Since I did not like the secret life of bees I was dubious. And unfortunately I was right. The only fully developed character was shallow and I had no empathy for her plight or lack thereof. There are many better books about the south and growing up there, try Pat Conroy."
1,Couldn't stick with this one,"I tried reading this on the advice of friends. I stayed with the book as long as I could, but the characters seemed maudlin,whiny, and just cardboard. When I got to the part about Brother Thomas, a former high-powered and celebrated attorney turned monk, lying prostrate on the floor of the chapel as a punishment for keeping a journal, I couldn't buy into it anymore. This one's not for me. And what's the deal with the bare-breasted mermaid displayed outside the monastary? And the monk lusting over the displayed breasts? And the main character and her brother visiting the mermaid chair as children so the brother could stroke the exposed breasts and nipples? And the mother whacks off her finger in the monastary? Yuck."
2,The Mermaid Chair,"Read this for a book club, and thought I would love it, as everyone else had read ""Secret Life of Bees."" I had not read that one, so I was continually wondering what I was missing as I read ""Mermaid."" I felt that it was contrived, made an overt effort to be ""literary,"" and omitted important connections that would have made the characters and action more believable. But because the author's style is smooth and natural, it was enjoyable to read--the disappointment comes with the overall lack of character development and reliance on coincidence."
4,"Good, but not great, read.","I would recommend this book as I was involved in the story and couldn't put it down. That is always worth at least 3 stars right there. The author's descriptions of the mother's friends were great. Her friends are sticking by her. The descriptions of the island and all its beauty and mystery were equally as intriguing. The only downfall is the love affair between Whit and Jesse. They know nothing about each other, haven't said one word to each other, haven't even spent much time together and all of a sudden, they are ""in love"" for the rest of their lives. I didn't buy it; therefore, I really didn't care whether she stayed with him or not."
3,Okay read,"I felt the same way about this book as I did when I finished Secert Life of Bees. I enjoyed the characters I had met, however the ending was presented in such a neat package there was nothing left to think about. If you enjoy an easy, clean break from a book read this."
2,"If you are expecting the Secret Life of Bees, don't look here","Sue Monk Kidd weaves a world of strong women with incredible backgrounds and great friendships. Beyond that, this book leaves alot to be desired. A monastary holds secrets that affect all the characters and really stretch the limits of believability. A really great build up to a dissappointing finish."
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this book. I did not even finish the book. No character was interesting enough. I didn't care what happened to any of them. The Secret Life of Bees ranks in my top 10 favorite books, this one doesn't seem to come from the same author. Don't bother."
2,disappointed bee lover,"I loved the secret life of bees, so couldn't wait to get this book. I found it predictable but a bit unbelievable (not in a suspension of disbelief kind of way, but in the way where things just don't hold together well and make sense, even mystically). I had to make myself finish the book, even though I could see how it would end about 1/2way through. I wish that the character of the mother had felt real - she just didn't make sense. <sigh>"
2,Disappointing.....,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this novel. Secret Life of Bees is one of my favorite modern novels, so I was expecting only excellence from Kidd's second book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I definitely shouldn't have bought the book. The plot was truly lacking in excitement and even her writing was unimpressive compared to the style of her first novel. It was totally overdone and unrealistic. I hope she gets her style back for the third novel--I'll give her another chance!"
1,"o.k. summer reading, but...","Disappointing, especially if you loved Secret Life of Bees as much as I did. It seemed as though the author took her story-lines from the Thorn Birds, Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, and a bunch of Nicholas Sparks books. Don't get your hopes up for this one."
2,Disappointed,"I read The Mermaid Chair based on the hype, but the experience didn't live up to it. I was disappointed that the backstory of the chair itself was not more central to the novel. Also, the story of the mother's attempts at repentance through self-mutilation did not have enough depth. Telling the story completely in third-person as opposed to alternating first/third would have allowed more exploration of the mother's own internal reflections, shedding more light on her story. Just another midlife crisis story? I think so. The fact that the affair was with a priest even became boring. The ending was predictable.I am not impressed with this novel."
1,What a disappointment,"Sue Monk Kidd is such a talented writer that it is difficult for me to fathom how she could even produce such an uninteresting and plot-free book. There were a few brilliantly written insights into the main character's struggle with the crossroads that her life was at, but other than that, this story was completely flat."
2,Barely worth it,"I was never as in love with ""Secret Life of Bees"" as the rest of the world -- a lot of it just seemed impossible, given the historical period -- so I came to this book with low expectations. Which were fulfilled much more than I expected.""Bees"" at least had some beautiful writing and interesting characters. The writing in this is watered down, and the characters are flat. Very little about them is original. The monk lost his pregnant wife in a car crash? Trite. Wife in a mid-life crisis, feeling unloved and unrecognized? Ho hum. Daughter carrying lifelong guilt for father's death? The same.The problem was, none of the characters came to life, so I couldn't care about their problems -- which weren't that original anyway. The mother, lopping off fingers? That was never really explained adequately.The only thing I give this book points for is the ambiguous ending, which is realistic and refreshing. Otherwise, a big bore."
1,Glad I rented it from the library,"Having read many excellent stories written by Sue Monk Kidd in Guidepost magazine I rented the book looking forward to a good well written story. I was very disappointed. It was like buying a Doris Day album, hurring home to listen to classy music and hearing instead Doris trying to imitate Britney Spears in life, dress, deed, and song."
3,Falls short of its potential,I'm left with mixed feelings. It started out strong but I wonder about Jessie's choice in the end. It doesn't seem to me to mesh with her transformation throughout the story. I also found the story-within-the-story of her parents a bit far-fetched.
3,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this book after reading the Secret Life of Bees. She could have left out the affair with the monk and developed the other charactars more and had a much better story.
3,Not as good as The Life of Bees,"Interesting concept, and the author did a great job of describing the island where the characters lived. But I just didn't like it as much as her earlier work."
2,Sadly Disappointed,"After reading the Secret Life of Bees and loving the beautiful story, I was estatic at a new book by Sue Monk Kidd. I really tried to like this book, wanted to like it so badly, but I was so disappointed by the writing style and the story line. I viewed it as this: If my friend told me that she needed to find herself and separating from her husband was the solution, I would support her. But finding herself through another man, a monk at that, I don't know how supportive I would be. The author's insistance that Jessie's sexcapades with Brother Thomas were part of her and him finding themselves just reeked of self-centered b.s.The other two flaws, although minor ones, involved Kidd's huge use of similes in the story. The second involved the last couple of chapters where Jessie and her mother are having an intervention in the Mermaids' tail and Jessie said she should have worried about her mother, but nothing ever came of that loose foreshadowing."
1,Does she think she's Pat Conroy?,"The single most disappointing book of 2005. I was eager to read this book as I had truly loved The Secret Life of Bees. Immediately I was reminded of Prince of Tides...only crossed with The Thorn Birds, with a little Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood thrown in...and then watered down considerably. Yes, her descriptions are lyrical, but the story is told from the viewpoint of a bored and boring housewife...the story is derivative and who really wants to read another book about a bored housewife's affair? If you really want to read this book, do yourself a big favor and check it out from your library."
2,Ick,I know fiction is supposed to be fantasy but who fantasizes about intimate relations with a monk? There's not a lot of character development and everything seems way too far-fetched even for fiction. It didn't keep my attention at all and at times I found myself being repulsed by what I was reading. The main character is so annoying. I gave it two stars because the writing was understandable and not too verbose. The Secret Life of Bees is SOOOO much better than this book.
2,A Disappointment,"The language, character development and intriguing story line in The Secret Life of Bees was rich and fascinating. This tale reads more like a dimestore paperback - one that I usually avoid. I finished it, hoping for something of substance to occur with the story line, but was disappointed. If you like a light read, the Mermaid Chair may work for you. I will be skeptical of Kidd's next novel."
1,Did not finish it.,"Because I loved ""The Secret Life of Bees"" I ran out and bought this book as soon as it came out - hardback - full price. I read about half of the book and put it down. It didn't seem like the author actually connected with her own characters. I didn't see any reason to continue."
2,A story for children,"Reilly's latest offering 'Hover Car Racer' is really nothing more than a souped up Disney story aimed at pubescent teenagers. His previous novels have been extremely enjoyable because of their slick pace and the entertainment value they provide. Whilst HCR does not lack in pace, it is by-the-numbers and highly predictable.Set in the future, the novel tells the story of Jason Chaser, a teenage hover car racer who graduates through Racing School and then onto the Pro Circuit. Much of the plot is cliched - narrow losses, interspersed with narrow victories. A villainous arch-rival. Scheming plots to destroy Jason's quest for victory. And you can pick the ending a mile off (as with most fictional tales with a sporting bent).This will undoubtedly be made into a Disney movie - the racetracks and scenery described in the book, as well as the action packed races, will make for great viewing. Still, the book was far too kitsch and cute for my liking. Disappointing."
2,microscope,"This is a very good idea for a child, but on this one the light would not stay on. If it worked better my son would use it alot more. I would have gone with one of the more expensive ones if I could do it over again."
3,"fun and easy, but with one problem","We bought this for our 6-year-old daughter, and she enjoys using it. It is simple enough that she can do it herself. However, within the first hour, the bulb burned out. We replaced it with the spare bulb that came in the box, and that one burned out less than a month later (and we do not use the microscope very much at all, she maybe turns it on a couple of times a week and never for very long). The slides that come with it are not very exciting, but we collected things from the yard to look at, and they showed up well."
2,could not get microscope to function,"Or maybe it was just me. There was a dark 'spot' somewhere in the lenses that made viewing nearly impossible - tried cleaning it, etc. Or maybe it was a Mfg error/flaw, etc. I'll keep the slides and stuff, but will trash the microscope itself and get a 'real' one. Think about it..... This thing theoretically says it goes up to 600X - pretty much horsepower for a toy. Personally, I think the optics are not so good - but then again, for the price, and if it works for you - then maybe small kids will like it."
3,Present,"I bought this item as a present for my daughter, and she loved it...she was able to use it to see many bug wings and the like...I am happy with this product because my daughter is happy with this product."
2,Its a blur!,"Trash! The light is faulty so it occasionally stays on, you cant focus on anything, only one of the three lenses focus's enough to make anything out. It comes with tons of stuff you dont need, wont use and will only be found through out the house later. Waste of money, dissapointing. We tried to look at an ant, psshhh. We tried to look at a leaf, Pshhhh. The premade slides, again you just cant focus to see anything so you get this terrible kalidaskope (sp) effect. DUMB! Buy any other microscope, just not this one."
1,...,"Really expected a better quality, even for the price. Shouldn't call it a microscope if you can't see microscopic things."
1,Not for people looking for mathematical logic,I am looking for information on mathematical logic and this book does not fulfill my requirement. Overall the book just glance over the topics. Disappointing cf other SOS books. Look elsewhere.
4,Good movie,"This was a good movie. And since it was on HD and not on Blu-Ray, it came at a good price. Glad to have it."
1,I'm surprised Neeson hasn't burned all the copies,"This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. In fact, the only thing that made it worth watching for the group of us who suffered through it one rainy afternoon was the sheer amount of MST3K-like abuse we could heap on it with little or no effort. It's a real stinker with horrific acting (yes, even Liam Neeson), a weak plot, a ridiculous screenplay, and a laughable ending that seems to have been scripted by an unpopular teenage boy set on making a statement that being a stubbornly lonesome outcast is heroic. If you're not in the mood for an evening of wide-eyed disbelief that a movie could be THIS BAD, save your money. On the other hand, it does have the same sort of unexplainable tragic attraction that leads people to stare at car accidents on the side of the road, and if you're the type of person who likes to point and laugh at the truly inane, this movie might be for you. I can't imagine for whom else it might have been made."
4,Read before you buy...,"For some reason, Amazon is marketing these things with the 505 reader. They only work for the 500, so do not waste your time and money. Sony has not yet released one for the 505. You need to check the same thing on the covers as well...if they are for the 500, they will not fit the 505. Otherwise, I am sure they work just fine with the 500...just don't make the mistake!"
3,Hidden Turnings,"Hidden Turnings, edited and assembeled by Diana Wayne-Jones, is a teriffic collection of short stories mostly in the science-fiction, or fantasy genre. This book contains short stories such as Fifty-Fafty, The Master (my personal favorite), and many more. I only gave this book three stars because although I liked Hidden Turnings, it was an average book, with not many exceptional features. It wasn't written that well, and I found that many of the characters lacked emotion, making some of the stories somewhat borring. This book was also just a bit below my reading and interrest level. It was probably for the 10 to 13 year old age group.Over all though, this was a good book and you should consider reading it."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings regarding this book. It is well written; obviously well researched. I like Charleston-I lived there from 1957-1975; and I majored in History in college and I like restaurants. But, (and you knew that was coming) this book is for architect buffs and foodies who love that old Charleston feeling. So, if you are a first time visitor wanting hotel information, easy to read restaurant reviews, shopping and tour suggestions, look elsewhere. Besides, beauty is in the eye of the beholder-and I would disagree with some of their opinions."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this product a few years ago, and it wasn't what I expected. I was hoping for an integrated system of biblical notes whereby I could click on a word in a scripture verse and find a well layered body of information. Such information would included the Greek/Hebrew meaning(s), other locations for this word, and what it likely means in this context. I have a fried with an older version of Quick Verse that is much better in this regard. His version was sold by a different company, and the content is much better. My version is a useful too, but NOT an electronically integrated tool for bible study. It's simply a CD filled with many disconnected pieces of good information. It certainly has some value, but failed to meet expectations."
5,Great features,Great phone with great features. Love the intercom and hands free talking. Make sure though you buy the updated version with improved volume and the 50 number phone book storage can be alphabetized.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The speakers are lame and noisy, and it is hard to hear, and I'm not hard of hearing! People are always asking me what I just said, too. And on speaker phone, this is the pits. There are a lot of nice gizmo type features, but the phone itself is not very good. Avoid."
1,Save two trips to the store,"I hate to admit that I bought this phone system.I bought it because the features looked great. An expandable system with one base unit.But I was really bummed when I got it home.You can't hear anyone when they call, and I am not so sure they can hear you. I had it turned up all the way and I was constantly asking people to repeat themselves.The answering machine is unusable, you can understand about 10% of what is said on a good day.The earpiece is very uncomfortable and as someone mentioned the menu to use your stored numbers is very clunky.I almost lost the packaging for these phones and was quite upset that I would have paid that much money for something that was worthless.It's too bad one star is as low as the scale goes.I would definitely not recommend this equipment.I hope Motorola's cell phones are better than this one."
1,bad phone,"This phone has such poor audio quality that it is almost useless. I bought it because of the features and nice design, but after having it for almost two years, I realize that THAT is all I paid for. Functionally it is a disaster!I only gave it one star because 'NO' stars was not an available option!"
2,Always check the region requirements,"I was unaware that it was a Region 2; therefore, I've been unable to check the quality. :(I'm bummed"
5,Great kitchen scale,"This scale works very well, is accurate, and easy to use. It easily allows tare weights, and easily changes from pounds to kilos. It is also quite compact, without any frivolous, inefficient bumps or bulges. As a result, it can easily be stored on edge, like a book. When I inadvertently dropped mine, rendering it dead, I promptly ordered another one."
2,not accurate,I liked the style and ease of use of this scale but it was inaccurate - it showed 4 gms over true weight -- not accurate enough for me and it also seemed to be inconsistent at times. I returned it and purchased a Chefmate stainless steel kitchen scale at Target for $39.99 which I love. It has all the same features - weighs up to 11 lbs and measures in increments of 1 g/.1 oz/1 ml. It also has the tare feature. It is has been very consistent and is more accurate.
5,Easy and tasty.,"I like this product a lot. It is the best coffee I've had, I think it's as good as the coffee I get from freshly ground beans. It's so easy to use. I tried both the original and mocha. I liked the original a lot, but really like the hint of chocolate in the mocha."
5,Unforgettable,The CD set of The Unforgettable Nat King Cole is just that Unforgettable. Nobody has a voice like Nat King Cole. Listening to him just brings back all sorts of memories. This is a great value on a wonderful set of CDs.
2,Not A Classic,"i was expecting a magical story about this wonderful little girl who goes on a great adventure and meets many amazing characters. it turns out Alice is a self centered little girl who annoys the creatures she meets and most of the creatures she meets are annoying too. with the ANNOTATED edition you get to find out Lewis Carroll liked to draw pictures of little girls in the nude. the esteemed scholars who annotate the book claim there was nothing inappropriate going on, but oh by the way, the real Alices mother did eventually prohibit Carroll from seeing her daughter. i guess the Disney folks forgot to put that part in the movie. overall it made for one huge disapointment and you shouldn't buy this story for yourself or your kids. On the plus side, Goodwill Books in Seattle did a great job of shipping the book, so hats off to them."
5,Amazing book.,"This is really the only book any Alice or non-Alice fan should buy. Not only does it have the original stories and is filled with art, but is also filled with amazing information about what is happening within the book. A great buy!"
4,Wonderful,"I bought this to read with my 7yr old daughter, figuring it would entertain us both, and it has. Even if you've only a passing interest in why hatters would be mad in Victorian England (mercury poisoning), or answers to the many riddles Carroll poses, this book will have you reading footnote after footnote, and give new pleasure and insight into the books."
2,"Looking for ""expert"" advice on effects in Max? Keep looking.","Touted as giving the reader insight on how to create spectacular effects in 3D Studio Max easily, one only needs to view the tutorial animations on the included CD to see how unimpressive the end results are. Understand, NOT ALL of the tutorials are bad, some the water effects are actually quite good. However, some of the tutorials that talk about a ""realistic"" look are far from it. The reader may find a few tips of value but for the price, money would be better spent elsewhere."
4,Great book to use all year long,"This book not only aided me in reviewing as the AP drew closer, but I was able to use it all year to review for tests in class. It is a little vague in some recounting of the history, and I found that its test questions are a little easier than what is found on the AP, but in general I LOVED this book, it's a great resource and tool. It helped me get a 5 on the test...hope it helps you too!"
1,Computer cannot recognize hard drive,"Here's an excerpt of an email I sent LaCie:""I would like to report a problem, I believe you have known about for quite sometime. This is only the second time I am connecting my external hard drive to my computer and, while the orange light turns on, my computer cannot recognize the hardware. I have not taking it anywhere, the cable is not damaged, and the hardware has never been poorly handled. I think it is despicable that you keep the Porsche line on the market, knowing all of the failures the products have...."""
1,AVOID!,there are a few lousy performances on this cd...along with studio cuts..not what it is advertised as
5,A must have for all leaders and managers,"This easy-to-read, well written book illustrates, with clear examples, the mistakes most leaders make, as well as the methods by which they can resolve them. It is a pathway to gaining trust and team cohesiveness, as well as buy-in both up and down the corporate ladder. It is a quick read, and should be re-read immediately after finishing it the first time."
5,Greatest Book on Leadership That I Have Ever Read!,"I am always trying to find books on people management, leadership and mentoring. I am the COO of a small size bank. I saw Captain Abrashoff on the Fox News Channel and decided to buy the book. Boy! am I glad I did. I loved it. I have passed it on to my boss to read and I will probably buy addtional copies for my staff to read.Reading this book made me wish I had been on the USS Benfold with these guys!"
1,never received product nor requested refund,"I never got the product for whatever reason I also sent a complaint email and nothing has happened, not even an apology much less an offer for a refund or even the actual product, i would settle for the actual product. due to all this happening and me relying on Amazon and the vendor I almost got fired from my job because thats what this book was for. as ridiculous as it sounds i had to read this book and write a report on it but again never received the book. so thank you Amazon i dont think ill be doing business with you anytime soon."
1,Arrogance at it's finest,The more I read the more I'm glad I never had to report to this man. I find it difficult to believe that the US Navy is still afloat without him. My company has suggested that the senior staff read this book. I'm all for improving and streamlining and more importantly increasing the morale and trust within the team. This book is nothing more than common sense. Treat people as you wish to be treated.
5,It's your ship is an easy read,Great book for leaders. Very down to earth and easy to apply the principles being presented. I started using a few after reading the book.
4,Great book,Purchased this title for a leadership course and loved reading it. Has lots of Navy examples on basic leadership principles. Good read!!!
3,Sculpting fairies in polymer clay,"This book is for more advanced sculpters. I found it hard to make the faces if you want a small scale. Instructions were a little confusing to follow, because of two spots in the book for the same thing."
5,"great lyrics, full of passion!","this cd is the greatest!!! i love the way they sing and the rythym is fantastic. i always qwas crazy about music like this, there is a lot of bass and sound!!! i just love it, as a matter of fact, i bought 5 copies of it, since it was so cheap. this is the greatesrt day of my life, i finally got them in the mail topday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Lukewarm Reading,"I started out very interested in what Mr. Howard had to say. A little more than half way through the book, it seemed to me that he was just talking in circles. It had no momentum. It was the same thing over and over. I get it already! For a conversion story, I can think of more interesting books than this one."
1,Yawn . . . BORING,"This book is very boring and a very hard read. In my opinion, this book is aimed at a person trained in either philosophy or English. I couldn't understand most of his points and stopped reading when I got to the half-way mark because I wasn't learning anything. Can't Elisabeth Elliot's bro write so the average person can understand what he's trying to say?"
1,Dont get these,"These speakers [stink]. I have owned them for about 3 months. After 38 days the sub went out. 8 days after i cant return them by the way. I returned it and about two weeks later i got my new one in the mail. Well its been about another 38 days and guess what? Yup it went out again. I talked to my friend at bestbuy and i guess they have been getting a ton of blown subs from logitech. Spend the extra money or whatever, just dont get these."
3,"Ok, but not the best","Decent swim diaper, especially for the price but not extra lined or cushy like the swim ones...It seems to run a bit big in the legs."
4,Sounds a Bit Off...,"First off, Season Two of Dollhouse is amazing. Things move from Season One and leap down an elevator shaft with the express car rocketing towards, both on a non-stop trip to hell. Everything gets worse, and the show is better for it. Season Two is much, much darker than the previous, as we see the evil inherent to the tech and how it begins to spiral out of control.I refuse to list spoilers, but if you liked Season One, be sure to watch this, the final season. It wraps up very nicely, if not prettily.The sound track of the DVD is a bit wonky through a 2-channel track, specifically on Disc Three: the sound dips to a whisper then fluctuates back to an audible level several times. Through 5.1, the effect is pretty much nullified. The quality of the sound on DVD is just enough to be annoying and it is why I marked the set at 4 stars. If it were just rating the show, then it'd be 5 stars, without a doubt."
3,Dollhouse Season 2,"I liked Season 1 much better... those episodes seemed more cohesive to me. Season 2 is pretty eclectic and quite different from the ""feel"" of season 1. I will finish watching Season 2 (1/2 way through) in hopes of they somehow tie a bow on it."
4,Great Product,Great Product! works fine! for the last two and half years its working smoothly... a Nice one! Lovely sound quality!
3,Good for computer playback and control,"I bought this for computer playback and control.I cannot speak for the in-dash features but all the people complaining about the radio forgetting presets it's the head unit (your radio) and not this tuner device that is forgetting the presets.I built a cable to control this via RS-232 port on my computer and have the hardware to add TOSlink optical output, but I haven't soldered that part in yet.The device is impossibly small and compact--really amazing.I had to really struggle to pry/grind/snip/file the FAKRA connector off the antenna jack. I'm not sure why the locking connector is needed in a car, anyway, because the antenna plug firmly stays connected without the FAKRA connector.The device supports the extended 32-character song/artist feature if your computer software or head unit supports it (I have never heard of any automotive head unit capable of handling the extended PAD data, but it's supported by this little device)."
4,Puddle Of Mudd Famous,Just want to say that the band's newest release Famous is very good. I found a great improvement musically and loved the new ideas that the band put forward this time. They have some great rocking songs as well a few ballad type songs. I also found that the overall production of this CD is much better than previous releases. I for one would recommend this CD
4,"Polished, but still another good album","This album is more polished that previous albums, but overall still retains the Puddle of Mudd fun and rock sound that we have all gotten used to. Again, they released the lead track as the first single ""famous"" good song, but almost always signals a fall for the sales and the rest of the album. I hope this isn't so. Other tracks like Moonshine, Merry Go Round, and Livin on Barrowed Time are reasons that this albums is worth picking up and keeping in a collection. If you like puddle of mudd already, get this album. If you don't know them till now, check the back catologue before getting this album."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Sure it's easy to bash these guys who're without a doubt heavily influenced by 90's bands such Nirvana and Alice in Chains, but I'll refrain from that.The albums starts strong with the chart rocking and ultra-catchy single 'Famous' and then slides into the realms of mediocrity. Those expecting numerous rocking songs in the vein of older classics such as Away From Me and Control etc will be bitterly disappointed, as this albums comprises of numerous bland 'rock ballads'. Next time the guys should stick at what they're good at; producing balls out Post-Grunge anthems."
5,Basically about stripping your own inhibitions,Carol Queen is now a famous sex educator who describes herself as a recovering shy person. In 13 chapters and 3 appendices she helps us understand what holds us back from exploring and fully enjoying our sexuality and offers exercises we can use to move into a more fulfilling passionate life with ourselves and with others. This book will not teach you how to strip or how to seduce someone until you feel comfortable with yourself first. An excellent book that offered me some advice I have tried to put into practice in my own life. I'm getting a little less shy every day and it feels good.
1,A little better than a magazine,"This is a small book. I expected more and have to say I was very dissapointed. While there is some good art from some good artists in this book, there is alot of amateur tiki art that is not worthy and you have to wonder why it is even in the book. What is the criteria for the tiki art in this book? There seems to be none, and frankly this book seems like a weak attempt to profit off the latest tiki craze. I do not recommend it to anyone. Compared to the other tiki books in my collection, this book leaves you very flat."
3,Old is better,"I grew up in the age of the original, ""The Thing"" and can remember being so scared as a young kid. I was in my twenties before I saw the original movie again and then I enjoyed it but wasn't quite so upset. The movie came to a definite end and all ended up well. To me, with the new version, the movie had too many possibilities and the ending left too much open. If you are young I am sure this review will be reversed. The new version will be the best version. It will all be left up to you and your generation. One thing that was never settled in my mind why was one of the main characters in the Artic getting drunk. That was so out of sync with a scientific movie. The seller of this movie did a great job in getting it to me and it was exactly as promised. I think it was just out of my generation as far as enjoyment went."
1,Please don't confuse this terrible movie with the 1951 Masterpiece,"Please don't confuse this terrible movie with the 1951 masterpiece, 'The Thing from Another World'.Most movie re-makes are bad, this one is no exception."
2,This is not a rating for the movie per se..,"I thought this movie was great. However, Amazon Instant Video did not work for me at all (wouldn't play past 00:27, at which point it displayed an error message), and I had to watch this movie somewhere else. Therefore, I think Amazon Instant Video is terrible. Hopefully others who try to watch movies with Amazon Instant Video do not encounter the same problems I did."
5,The movie that made me a horror fanatic,"I know that most people consider this one Sci-fi with horror and I agree. This movie reminds me of Alien a lot but I saw it first and when I saw Alien I said ""This reminds me of the Thing"" MacReady was a guy who would help others if it didn't hurt his well-being. He shot Clark but Clark wasn't obeying orders and he could have been a thing. I thought when MacReady was doing his blood test he shouldn't have tied everyone together because Palmer died becasue of that. Also he shouldn't have locked up Blair in the outhouse because he could've escaped and killed them eariler than he did. Everybody thought MacReady was a thing and it was amazing that they didn't kill him. I went on and on about this movie for weeks after i'd seen it but it was so good. This is a movie people who aren't in to horror should see because it will get you into horror. John Carpenter did a good job on this one but after all he did make Halloween."
3,Remaster the sound track in DTS EX or DTS 5.1,"The collectors edition is good with the special features but the sound is weak. They did ""Big Troulble in Little China"" in DTS. Universal should remaster this movies soundtrack. It would be played a lot more by me."
5,"Best (and nastiest) shapeshifter, ever!","Okay, you've read all the praise, and it's all true, this is a helluva scary movie, well-made, the effects are outstanding, and it holds up well over time.But that's not all there is to it.We've all seen morph effects, one critter transforming smoothly into another, we were pretty bored with them by the early 1990's. Big deal.But this was made before cheap, cheesy CGI morphs. There's nothing smooth about these transformations. Much the opposite. What's so monstrous about this Thing, is that everything about its transformations is so WRONG. This critter has a rather nasty disregard for the rules, it doesn't care, for example, that heads aren't supposed to sprout crab legs and walk off on their own.The infamous ""pissed-off cabbage"" effect (a flower composed of half a dozen lower Huskie jaws) still gives me nightmares almost 30 years later...Very imaginative special effects."
5,Snakker du norsk?,"Okay, look. The next time you're visited by a dog being shot at by a bunch of screaming Norwegians in a helicopter, let the Norwegians have their way. Either that, or learn to speak Norwegian. Unless you have no objections to your head falling off and turning into a huge screaming spider, that is."
2,nostop gorefest doesnt really add up,lost in the cold regions of some other country..Russell and co. battle evil aliens that..when the horror begins the killings are gruesome but icky and they leave this movie a bore..Russell and Keith David surviving at the end was a good idea but we couldve did without the blood pussing out..a head crawling on roots and all that junk...a john carpenter dissapointment really
1,False advertising,"This was advertised as the original 1951 movie, however, upon reviewing my orders thru my account, the wrong movie (with Kurt Russell) is being shipped and I cannot cancel my order. Will not order from this vendor again."
5,Worth getting a DVD player just for this film!,"This is one movie which makes great use of the DVD format. In fact, it's the best overall DVD package I've seen so far. There are so many extras that you'll need several days just to get through them all. As for the movie, I saw it when it was first released in 1982 (I went with my mother!). I absolutely loved it then, so I just had to get the ultimate version of this movie when it came out on DVD; in fact, the release of 'The Thing', with all its extras, was probably the main reason that I went ahead and bought a DVD player. Specifically, concerning the extras, the 80 minute ""making of"" documentary is outstanding, as are the cut scenes, production notes, photographs, etc. I've always loved the flying saucer in the film, and the behind the scenes material includes a lot of footage of the saucer (how it was constructed, filmed, the original unused concept, etc.) All in all, highly recommended!"
4,One of the Creepiest Movies I've ever seen!,"The first time I saw this movie was on the Sci-Fi channel, and I knew I had to have it. I went out to Wal Mart and bought it(no offense to amazon).It scars the mind with it's plot: the ultimate form of paranoia. Even for the early 1980's, the special effects gave it a convincing look. Entertainment Weekly published an issue which gave the top 25 scariest movies ever made, and this ranked number twelve.It scared me so much, that I waited a few weeks after buying it before watcing it again. There was one thing I hated, the end."
5,A Masterpiece!!!,"This is the greatest remake of any film I have ever seen. The acting is BRILLIANT- God, I could go on for hours. Orgasmic for the horror afficienado.. If you have'nt seen this, whether or not your a horror fan, BUY IT NOW. 'Nuff said."
5,Never dig something out of the ice.,"First off, the movie is a classic based on the story, Who Goes There?, and is as timeless as you can get. A group of men are trapped in a remote Antarctic research station after finding out that among them is a shape changing alien.The special effects hold up, mostly because they are rarely used. This movie is about the story and the twelve male characters who interact together, trying to survive.The DVD has a commentary track with Kurt Russell and John Carpenter, a 80 minute documentary about the making of the movie, lots of extras in the form of photos, outtakes, behind-the-scenes location footage and more.A must for any sci-fi fan or Kurt Russell fan."
2,The worst packaging,"I never got around to buying the first release of this movie on dvd, but, when I saw this new transfer advertised in BestBuy's weekly circular, I couldn't let this classic slip through my hands. Unfortunately, when you try to remove the disc from the case you have to break the the plastic ring that holds it or you'll end up warping the damn thing! Aside from that the movie is a great digital transfer.What will they think of next.The movie is an all-time classic and better than the original, which is rare for a remake. There's enough suspense and gore to keep any horror fan interested. I feel this film should be in everyone's collection, regardless if they like horror or sci-fi movies. Why? Because I said so! ;-)"
4,moderately satisfied,didn't really mind that there was no cover (i think that was in the details that I didn't read) but it took a week longer than it should have to get here. I needed it for a project so I ended up having to buy another copy at best buy. Only reason I'm not more miffed is that I needed another copy anyway.
4,"Fun as Blu-Ray, but UK version is better buy.","I was watching the Collector's Edition of the movie, and it's definitely fun. I just wonder where I'm supposed to find the ""Alternate Ending"", as opposed to it being shown on TV once, or so I've heard. I like the crisp, crystal clear sound quality I recieved from Blu Ray on this movie, but with no extras, i condemn Universal for making such an unnecessary move. If you are looking for the thrill and re-digitizing aspect of good horror sci-fi making, then this is for you. However, if you have the Collector's Edition, and you plan to purchase the Blu-Ray edition, I strongly recommend that you keep the Collector's if you want those fun extras."
4,"""Skeeter""","I really liked this movie and I can especially recommend it for family viewing. It shows a close, functioning family without excess sentimentality. The movie focuses on how Wilma overcame polio and personal obstacles to become a great runner and Olympic champion. Most of the movie deals with these struggles without too much time spent on the actual Olympic experience( nice original footage of the real Wilma in action).It also shows an era when real grown-ups were in charge.The characters are played very convincingly- Shirley Jo Finney as Wilma is especially good. I think anyone could enjoy this movie- and it's family entertainment at its best."
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT,"I've had this scale for about 6 years. I only had to replace the batter once. I use it daily! It reads fast, zeros fast, easy to clean, simply perfect!I really couldn't live without it!"
1,white watch,I returned this watch. The band doesn't work well and kept opening. It's too bulky. I was disapointed with this product.
2,A little disappointed!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"The watch is beautiful but changing the date will not work it too much of a chore, I tried to change the date and the whole crown came off! $55.00 later it was fixed. Wow! Make it simple!"
2,Definitely Not Worth Buying or Reading!,"This one is another one of the hugely over-rated books of DP's.... This book just wasn't developed well at all emotionally, & does it make any sense to anybody that a father'd lie about his own daughter & make her out to be a gold-digger in front of other people simply bcs. they R mad at each other at the moment? (The storyline is just simply quite unbelievable....)"
2,Styx is back.....not really!!,"If you want to see Styx with only Tommy Shaw songs, this DVD is for you. Tommy covers his songs great but without Dennis singing the classic Styx songs, you lose a lot. The new singer tries to do Dennis' songs but falls very short. The picture and audio is excellent but there are too many shots of the crowd. Return to Paradise is a must see, get this if you just need a new Styx fix."
5,Wish I had been there!,"Both bands really shine in this concert video. Styx mixes it up with some classics and some newer tunes. The additions of Glen Burtnik and Lawrence Gowan to the band create a great new dynamic onstage. You can see how much these guys love playing together and their energy is infectious.REO Speedwagon also put on an incredible show. The newly blond Kevin Cronin leads the band through a set of some of their best songs, capped of by my favorite of their set - 157 Riverside Avenue. Kevin really goes off in this one! He really knows how to work an audience. As for Dave,the guitarist - this man can jam! Great solos. All in all - the whole band sounds great.Then there's a jam session with both REO and Styx. When I heard it on the CD, I imagined that it would have been great to see. The video/DVD definitely proves that. Just wish I had actually been there."
3,501 verbs isnot very many,"I am glad I purchased this book, however it is lacking. Expansion rules are specified but not explained. Sentence use examples are given, but points are excluded from other words used in the sentence. Nouns (even the basic ones) formed from the verbs arenot provided along with other things mentioned by other reviewers. If this book was made complete it would be have to be physically larger and thicker than its already almost one thousand pages. But, if complete, it would be a must-buy."
4,Shiny soft hair,This is a great product. It add shine and volume to my hair. It doesn't feel greasy and heavy like other products I have tried.
4,Works for me!!,"Now, everyone knows that this film isn't one of the greatest of all time. However, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable, as much as any I've seen in years! The kids are great & Schwarzenegger's interaction with them is priceless. Great directing by Ivan Reitman. Fine screenwiting by the team of Salem, Weingard, & Harris.Well acted by the adults in the cast: Penelope Ann Miller, Pamela Reed, Linda Hunt, Richard Tyson, & Carrol Baker. PG-13."
3,CLASSIC !,"THis movie is better than ""JUNIOR""; there are more jokes. BUt it's not a Arnold's classic, no!"
1,Dont Buy!,"It is hard to believe that you can only get Kindergarten Cop in full screen, denying us movie fans the pleasure of watching the film as it was intended by the director, in the original format. What can Universal Pictures be thinking? Such a travesty. Don't buy. Boycott until they release this movie in widescreen."
2,Nothing like Bollywood,"Nothing like you see in Bollywood dance, very slow and the moves weren't that great. Regret that I spend my money in this DVD. This DVD is for elderly women that will like to get in shape."
5,A+,"This stuff is Awesome :) - It only takes a drop to maybe a few depending on what you are mixing it with. It is very concentrated. I am in heaven because I finally found a product I can use. I have multiple food allergies, and it seems that there is always something in the other liquid smoke products that I cannot ingest. This brand, however is just 100% natural liquid smoke.... Nothing more, nothing less."
2,Iffy,It wasn't very helpful to people who already know who they are.A good person just getting into the show.All I can say is don't expect alot from this book other than telling you little junk about each character.
2,"cute,but not worth looking for","If you are a Sailor Moon fan like me,you might be on the lookout for this book,thinking that it will make a good addition to your collection. Well,I hate to say this,but unless you're REALLY obsessed with the show,you might be better off buying something else instead. There is nothing in this book that a Sailor Moon fan wouldn't know already. And it's not a very good introduction for those who don't watch Sailor Moon and would like to know more about it, either...It's not incredibly accurate. Therefore, there is no point in buying Meet Sailor Moon. Its only redeeming qualities are the illustrations. However,they aren't enough to turn this disasterous attempt at writing a book based on the dubbed version of the show into a good novel."
3,Interesting from a historical context,"This is a simple instructional film made by the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht just prior to the invasion in Normandy in June of 1944. It shows some simple techniques for the war time sniper. Very basic stuff. By this time in the war, Germany was throwing everything it could get or scrounge up, to fight the Soviets and the Americans/British. Actually, for Germany at the time, the film is rather sad. Interesting for historians."
2,Leaves Hair Staticky,"When I read the reviews on this item, I kind of ignored the comments people left about making your hair staticky, thinking the reviewers must just have dry hair. However, because of the velvet it really does make your hair staticky! Sometimes it will be a little staticky as I do my hair then I tame it, but later in the day half my head of hair will be standing up! I always have to bring a hair tie with me to work because I end up putting it up over the lunch hour.It's annoying, so I would recommend getting a different straightener."
4,good enough,i love my straightnerat first i wasn't sure which one to buy because there are so many available.i read the reviews for this one and ordered it n i love it.
4,This Item is REALLY GREAT!,"My older sister has this flat iron, and it was so great that I bought another one for our other sister as a birthday present. At first, I was a little hesistant because I hadn't heard of the brand before, but it really gets the job done (better than the iron from a well-known brand too). Yes, it gets pretty hot, but thats what you want right? Just be careful(: All in all, for the price that it is, this iron is really good, and I recommend it to everyone."
4,Very satisfied,"I purchased this flat iron as an alternative to the more expensive ones on the market. I have extremely curly hair and was pleased with the results. It doesn't straighten in one pass but it does do a good job. I've tried wider plates (2"") and they straighten but don't leave a nice shape like this one. The smaller barrels with the rounded edges are definitely the way to go. Although I don't use it every day I expect it will last far beyond the money I've invested. A tip: it pays to pair this with a straightening product such as Rusk's 'Straight8'. You'll be very happy with the results."
5,perfect,"I was skeptical of this product but I figured for 35 bucks, I'd take a chance. A few years ago I bought a Conair straightener for nearly 70 dollars and it was worthless, so I was a bit skeptical as I said. However, when I got it in the mail yesterday evening, I plugged it in and I was amazed. I have rather wavy, tough, thick hair. I thought the only way to tame it was a chemical straightening, which I did 2 years ago and it was soooo expensive. I plugged this straightener in and it heated up within seconds. Not minutes, people. The first time I ran it across a bit of my hair, I was shocked. This is an amazing hair straightener and I am sooooo happy I purchased it. It turned my thick hair into something that looked so amazing. I've never seen anything like it. I would highly highly highly recommend this product for anyone who had coarse thick hair, or just anyone who wants straight hair. It's amazing."
3,oh no,"this iron is for 120V and in my contry ,there is 22OV... WHAT CAN I DO?? Will it burn out if I turn it on????"
5,Great product!,"It works very well, it is very practice and light. It heats very fast and does its works appropriately.I liked it so much. The delivery was very fast too."
3,Okay,"This iron made my hair frizzy. I've used 2 other flat irons before and they did not leave my hair static-y. I like the fact that it has 25 settings. This one gets hot enough for my medium to thick hair. It claims to heat up to 450 degrees fahrenheit. Not a bad product, but not the best either."
4,Great flat iron,"This is the first flat iron that I've ever owned, and I was concerned about damaging my hair, burning myself a lot, and taking up a lot of time in the mornings. I've been pleasantly surprised by this product. I've noticed that my hair feels a little drier than it used to, but I think that is unavoidable and it is not nearly as bad as I was expecting. I haven't burned myself once. It heats up quickly and straightens my hair with at most two passes (I have medium thickness, wavy hair). Overall, I'm happy with it!"
3,Ceramic Flat Iron - Review,"As an African American woman with coarse hair, this was the first flat iron I've ever used to straighten it. This flat iron gets very hot, but I was unable to get very close to the roots and the ends of my hair were very frizzy after using it. I still had to use a hot comb to touch up these areas."
5,Great effect,"This iron is working great even on my thick hair. It gets very hot and once straightened the hair stays like this a long time. Looks and works as an expensive iron, but costs one third of the usual price for such product."
2,not for trim carpenter,"this sliding miter saw is not design for trim carpenter. bad quality cuts on moulding smaller than 1"", you have to put a lot of presure to the moulding and cut real slow to make good quality cut.I use the two best blade in the market(forrest and tenryu) and I don't see any differense in small moulding. to cut material over 1 1/2 (not to bad). dust port and bag(bad desing) the only thing I like from this miter saw, is real small(compared to ridgid bosch and hitachi.) Not recomend this miter saw to a friend. try milwaukee or bosch(reader choice and best overall)"
5,Love it,This saw has been great so far. You can really tell the quality in the cuts and angles. Overall I am very pleased with this saw.
1,worst of the worst,horriable slide.even worse blade(so called blade?) very cheap. i am insulted they would sell this as a real saw .and for $700 it is the worst tool i have ever bought. BUT dewalt did send me a refund.i guess as long as they stand by there hunk of junk saw they can get a 1 star rating
4,great saw,"I sure like the saw, it is very neat, cant wait till i have a new project to work on. I sure like the sliding part"
