3,Nice for the price.,"Seems a little cheap but for twenty bucks you can't complain. It looks perfect just doesn't seem as durable as some of the other vests i've worn. I ordered this late on a friday and it showed up monday.WOW! Perfect if you don't plan on wearing it all the time. Another review I read stated they come small. I disagree, and think mine fits true to size. The tie is very sharp."
1,Gar-bajj,"I got this book as a gift from my sister, so I read it out of deference to her. But let me tell you it was a mighty painful process, and not from what you think. It wasn't from the painful realities I was hit with but the blathering, wimpy, self-loathing that guy exudes. When you stop whining and worrying and apologizing and agonizing about women, then you've arrived my son.....no need to waste your money on this book, better to spend it on a John Ford/John Wayne movie. That'll give you yer fill of manliness......In the end, Keen is no closer to epiphany that when he was prematurely you-know-what in his youth......"
4,I think this is the book in which my poem might be published,"I had a poem published in this book (hopefully it's the right one!) I was wondering what some people thought about it and if they have any clues on where I might be able to find outside of using the computer. My poem was ""The world is stone"" If anyone can email me back at Republica19@aol.com. Thank you!"
5,Laugh until you cry.,This is a hilarious series. I saw it the first time a few weeks ago. The best part are the short films.The long films get a little old after a while. With the short ones you get more in little installments. I was laughing until I cried. The inuendosare great. My favorite has to be the one of dating. Weenie Roast anyone?
4,"HERE'S THE TICKET IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE CHALLENGES, ISSUES & TRENDS IN NURSING","This guidebook of the challenges, issues and trends in today's world of nursing is organized into four multi-chapter sections;EDUCATIONLEGAL & ETHICAL ACCOUNTABILITYECONOMICSCAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PROFESSIONAL GROWTH""Nursing in Today's World: Challenges, Issues, and Trends"" was written by nurses for nurses and is a must read for those entering the field and an interesting refresher for seasoned, professional nursing veterans."
2,Only book of its kind...a real shame,"This book is indispensable for doing complex i/o work in c++. Unfortunately, it's also a ponderous, confusing read. The density of the prose and the mediocre organization make it very difficult to use as a reference book.I've never had it steer me wrong, but every time I've used it, it has taken a lot of time and energy to actually find and decipher the content I needed.I'd advise waiting for ""Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales"" to come out in Dec 1999 instead, it'll be current and the preliminary reviews sound good.."
1,"The Information is There, I Guess . . .","As a Chicagoland native and budding fan of ""Outfit"" stories, I was anxious to learn all I could about ""Joe Batters"". This book does deliver information I didn't already have, but don't let the page count fool you. Roemer pads this book with all kinds of extraneous stuff, and wanders in his narrative. He has no idea how to organize information, and this book seems to be no more than a rough draft. Roemer claims to be impartial, but opinion drips from every sentence. He can never let the evidence speak for itself. He always has to comment on it. If you're expecting nothing more than one man's war stories of his time in the FBI, then this book will not disappoint, but this is not the omnibus of Accardo information that I was hoping for."
1,profanity,"I am a mountain girl and was looking forward to this book ,but trashed it in the first chapter because of profanity"
1,Brother's Keeper,Very disappointing. This was not a story worth all the hoopla. I felt like I wasted my money. I'm not even sure if I finished watching it or fell asleep before it was over. Thumbs down.
5,Best documentary I've ever seen & Iwatch it again and again.....,"It is a look into the real justice system,Justice really is who has the most money...atleast for me it is and I haven't been wrong yet in firsthand experiences......this is a great great movie....raw and at it's best!"
5,"""Get up on this!!""","This is my favorite WATP dvd, hands down! Leslie's pumped (well when isn't she...) the walkers are super excited and the set looks great. She does all the basics: side step, marches, knee lifts and kicks, but its such a FUN 4 miles and the music is GOOD! You can feel the energy from beginning to end...most importantly the effects of the workout afterward. FEELS SO GOOD TO SWEAT, SWEAT, SWEAT!!"
3,Nice but a Little Slow,"I agree with the other review that stated this is a nice workout because you didn't need anything additional like a stretchie, etc. to work out. Sometimes I just want the straight walking.However, I find the workout to be a little slow. I enjoyed some of the different moves in this as opposed to her other videos like the grapevine, the double kickback and the double sidesteps with a tap. However, I own Leslie's 5 mile tape and that is definitely an advanced level workout with 1 of the miles being only 10 minutes. This tape was close to 1 full hour for 4 miles and her 5 mile advanced tape is only 62 minutes. So for only 2 minutes more I can get an extra mile in.This tape is nice though when I don't want a full on harder workout like her 5 mile tape. But I do wish she did a more fast moving 4 mile workout."
5,She's Made a Believer Out of Me!!!!!,"I thought I would buy this video because I had gotten away from my semi-regular exercise routine and also because after my surgery, I was not able to do any strenous exercise. Well, I can't tell you how happy I am that I bought this video. I love it! Very easy to follow and I love the music and Leslie's energy! My first time doing the video, I walked the whole 4 miles! I didn't expect to, but I was loving it so much, and each time that mile meter came up, I was more motivated! A definite must have for those who hate a lot of dancing and complicated moves. Besides, WALKING is the best exercise that the body could ever get!"
5,Great Workout,I have several Leslie Sansone tapes and this is by far the hardest workout. The fast pace is great. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who is seeking an aggressive workout. This is not for beginning walkers.
1,extremely boring!,"I consider myself being in a good shape, not great, just good. I do not work out on a regular basis, and I am 35 years old. I couldn't finish this workout, I did only 3 miles: it was just extremely boring! You just literally walk 4 miles raising arms and doing some slight variations of walking movement from time to time. Even completely unfit people could have a bit more variety and complexity of movements."
5,"Energizing, Motivating Workout!","I purchased this DVD after the birth of my twin sons and strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to get back into shape (and can committ to a 45 minute workout). Leslie manages to be energizing and engaging without getting into that whole cheerleader thing that other aerobic instructors have. Her cues are wonderful and the steps extremely easy to follow, and you'll see results within a week. This is a focused power-walk workout that anyone can do, no matter what shape you're in. One of the best things about this DVD is Leslie's fellow walkers - they're all ages, shapes and sizes, something I find extremely motaving and realistic. Buy this DVD - you won't regret it!"
4,Easy way to exercise and lose weight,This is my second Leslie Sansone workout video and she is a great motivator for those just beginning and those that are trying to get moving again!
4,Too much talk,"While the workout is great, after walking with the video just two times I had to turn the sound off. L. Sansone NEVER stops talking for the entire hour. I wish she'd do a walking workout where she simply introduced the steps, and then just did them --without the running monologue. I now either listen to the news on the radio, or just enjoy the quiet of my home, while I walk along with the video."
3,not a bad workout,"After using Leslie Sansone's Ab workout package, I got the 4 mile super challenge. This workout is my least favorite from the 8 tapes I have bought so far. The music in the beginning is extremely annoying and Leslie is way too fake in this video. Also, I cannot explain why it takes less time to do mile 4 (which is suppose to be more of a cool down) than mile 3 (which is upbeat and energetic). I wouldn't recommend this particular video but I encourage you to get her 3 mile videos. I have been using her videos for 2 months and am happy with the results and with the variety of videos Leslie has. You won't get bored or tired of the same old thing as long as you have more than 3 videos. I recommend buying a new one each week if you see results."
4,Great workout but one small gripe...,"First and foremost, this is a great workout for me, I'd give the workout itself 5 stars. I bought this in the DVD format because I wanted to be able to do 1 or 2 miles then quickly get to the stretching segment at the end without prolonged fast-forwarding that one would need to do with a VHS tape. The ability to do this is a huge advantage DVDs have over VHS format. Most of my workout DVDs have this feature.Unfortunately, this DVD is not formatted that way. You cannot go back to a main menu then select the cool-down stretch. If you want to get to the end you have to step it forward, i.e. fast forward. On my DVD player this is even slower than fast forward on a VCR.So when I don't do the whole workout I do my own stretching routine. But had I known this before buying the DVD I would have bought the VHS tape."
3,Walk Away Pounds Express,I really like this DVD. I think Leslie is great. However it is not very challenging for advanced level. I had to do the tape two times almost to get a really good sweat and I am 50 years old. This is proberly because I already do 4 or 5 miles. I just worked a little harder than she did to get my heart beat up where it needed to be. What I am going to do when I do this work out is add my step that I use with another tape and that will really get my heartbeat where it needs to be in an hour. It is really sad because this can be a great tape.I really liked the music also however the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it just is not very challenging.I would say this is for a person that is just starting to work out.
3,"Interesting, and challenging","I just bought this, and althought you get a good workout. It seems that she woke up and decided to film this. The cues are not the best, and she seems to be making up the combinations as she goes on. There didn't seem to be any organization to this workout, and when the music changes there is silence which seems like a minute, so you lose that pace. But you will work up a good sweat. The Walk Away the Pounds are better, as well as the Abs workout."
5,really good workout,"I have one other tape from leslie, i think its a five mile walk. I really like this workout. I needed something lower impact because I was injured in a car accident and this fits the bill. Its at a faster pace than the other video I have but I find that the time just flies by. I have no problem finishing this workout (its an hour), though the five mile walk I have, I cant seem to get through all five miles. I think because its at a slower pace, so you notice that it takes longer. The moves can be a little repetitious but its fun and you actually break a sweat and get your heart rate up. I think this could be used for beginner to intermediate exercisers, or maybe even advanced when they want to take it easy."
4,fun dances,"There were some good songs and fun dances but was a little disappointed in the ""reproduction"" of some of the songs. Good place to find multiple party songs."
5,DeWalt 18volt Cordless Vacuum DC515,"This vacuum works great! It sure beats dragging out the corded shop vac from the basement to vacuum up drywall dust or sawdust after drilling a few holes, etc. It won't replace a full sized shop vac, but it is great for small to medium sized jobs. It may be loud, but it is a cordless power tool. And really I can't think of any vacuums that I have ever used that are ""quiet"". The vacuum is easy to empty and the filter is easy to clean. The only complaint I have is that it will drain older batteries rather quickly, but the kit does come with an XRP battery, which seems to have good run time. Overall I would highly recommend it."
4,Works great on dusty jobs,"This was purchased for my husband last year. I've been using it for vacuuming up thick dust in my chicken coop. It works great at picking up dust, wood chips and anything really small. It's also light and easy to carry. The battery life is fairly good, as well. I also liked that the container was easy to take on and off.The few things I don't care for about this vacuum? The small size of the holding area for one. It's so small that if you have a large project you'll have to dump out the dust quite a bit. Yes, it's very noisy as well. It's for picking up small things only, I wish it would pick up more than dust, but it's mainly a dust vac.Overall, a good deal. I'd purchase again."
4,Great vacume but loud,"Love the Vac. Easy to empty, great suction (velosity and suction) but really loud. I bought this for small project cleanup and househould touchup.Really like it."
5,"Forget the price, it's just perfect.","First, I spend quite a while comparing this ... 12 clensing tissues and how much I love my pocket pc. Finally, after order and use it, surprisingly my ipaq screen friction just gone!! I also feel that there is a protection film on the screen. And the best thing is, although not recommend, the polish cloth seems to be reusable, so 1 pack of this cleanser can be used for a year. It's also good for my eyeglasses."
1,NOT FOR VISTA,"The lid of this pathetic toy device broke off the first time I opened it. But it doesn't matter, it turned out not to be compaible with the Vista operating system.I learned that not from the support line, which doesn't answer, or from any information possible to obtain before purchase on line.I learned it from reading the box, which does not mention Vista by name; but says it is compatible with XP.My congratulations to Amazon (again) for a superb return policy. My message to the Teac marketing department: does your mother know where you work?"
2,Unreliable--Touchy--Electronics Issue,"This product has forever tainted my feelings about the Teac/Tascam brand. If you research this on the net, you will discover there is an electronic issue which causes the unit to loose communication with the PC. They wanted about $90 for a generic repair charge post warranty. When it does work, the disk surface is super critical on how well it prints. My best luck has been to get about 33% of the disks to print correctly. The other 66% had missing segments of black ink/resin--which looks bad. This is a great idea, but the touchiness and the electronic issue makes this a looser. I am going back to Sharpie markers."
1,Save your money and your frustration,"This phone is not worth the hype. It has major flaws, such as freezing up; making calls on its own; key pad is way too small; your face will touch the screen during calls and will cause you to lose your call; if you talk on the phone more than 3 or 4 times per day (on an average call) your battery will have to be recharged; nevertheless, you have to recharge the phone everyday anyway (this phone has very poor battery life). Problems will occur more frequently after your 15 day trail period has expired and Verizon will only replace your phone with another chocolate phone. If you are fed up with the chocolate phone they will only replace your phone with a phone of their choice - even if you offer to pay the difference for the phone of your choice."
2,"Still uncomfortable, negligible sound quality improvement","Still uncomfortable, in fact the original pads were softer and easier to get used to. The negligible sound quality improvement doesn't make up for the fact that your bare ears are rubbing against the exposed insides of the headphone earpiece."
2,not comfortable,Not very comfortable unless you're a young child with very small ears. The material is also a bit rigid. not for long listening sessions. the origianl earpads are more comfortable than these. hold on to your 20 bucks.
4,...,"This book is a good review for the NAB. It is written by one of the item writers for the NAB exam. There is also a book that corresponds with this review book, where most of the questions come from. I give the book 4 stars because the typos are annoying, however, the questions will show up on the NAB, possibly in different wording. That is why it is important to understand what the questions mean, and not memorize them. I am ending my 4 year program of long term healthcare administration. You have to read the books that go along with the review questions to know what the questions mean. You can not memorize the answers to the questions in the book and expect to pass the NAB. Memorization is not understanding of concepts, and state and federal laws. Overall the book is useful because it is written by one of the NAB question writers. By the way, there is a new edition that would be better."
5,Great,"I could not but this book down. I don't have horses, But after reading this book, I really want to learn more about them. the Authors kept it very interesting. Hope they continue to right books."
5,Just what I wanted at a very good price,"My home computer is a laptop. I'm learning 10-key online (for free... Google it!) and I can do 10-key with my desktop computer at work, so I got this cool little accessory and my laptop ""recognized"" it less than a minute after I hooked it up, and I used it to do my taxes last month. The two additional USB ports are a plus."
2,Does NOT work as promised with Mac,"Works well with PC programs running via Parallels, but does not work as required with Mac (i.e., in Word and Excel, inputting any numbers functions as a backspace - you see the number for a second then it auto erases it by backspacing, taking the number you've input and any addition surrounding type away). I will be returning this item. And since there are no drivers to download, you're stuck with what it is... only good for PC."
4,Superb Miming and Humour,"One of the great films in the M. Hulot series. Jaques Tati is a great performer and makes this, like most of his films a pleasant escape from the realities of his - and now our - modern world. Watch it if you can!"
3,Warning!,"This is a warning to those who love colorized movies like I do, THIS IS NOT A COLORIZED MOVIE!! This movie was shot in color it was never b/w to begin with so this movie is in color but only because it was shot in color originally. I got the tape of this move just recently and discovered only then I had been misled by the Amazon title it gives to the movie, IT IS NOT COLORIZED, it is only a color movie.Aside from that major disappointment, the movie itself was fairly entertaining in a French humor sort of way. I almost fell asleep as it does tend to go on forever, but if you're in the mood for a movie critics claim is great comedy, go ahead and watch, who knows you might even raise one corner of your mouth in ""laughter"". I found it mainly a bore, but ever so slightly interesting, but not funny."
2,A bit of a mixed bag,I felt Mon Oncle had its moments - but there were times when I struggled to get any meaning (and I generally like so-called slow films e.g. Wang Kai-War's In the mood for love). Much preferred M. Hulot's Holiday. Helps if you like dogs!
1,buyers beware,"I really recommend that people watch this film before buying it. Although most of the reviews here are extremely positive, many people who have seen this film--including just about everyone I know--find this film excrutiatingly unfunny. There is a lot of inventiveness, but I watched the whole film without laughing once, and I have found that to be a common experience from talking to other people. Personally, I would take my money and spend it on the Marx Brothers or Fawlty Towers or The Office or Tatie Danielle or one of the other wonderful Criterion offerings. At the very least, I hope you will make sure you find this film funny before you buy it."
1,"A very funny movie, if by ""funny"" you mean ""boring"".","This is not a bad movie, but it is a painfully boring one. I read nothing but good reviews for Mon Oncle, expecting a good, fun movie. But it was just really long and boring. If you've never seen it, and are interested in seeing it, rent it first. You're not missing anything if you skip it."
4,"Distinctly not DEVO, but better in their own way.","Clawhammer have been around for 2 decades and this CD has been kind of hard to find for under $10. If you like DEVO but you wish they had more of a hard edge then this CD is for you. The singer has a sound that, like most innovative things requires an acquired taste. Much like Bands like TEN FOOT POLE, or THE MEATPUPPETS. Don't be a ninny or a twit.... Be DEVO."
2,"Not a great film, but not as bad as I expected","Having heard all the gripes about this film, and having seen that it won the Golden Raspberry awards for worst film/actor/actress, I was really prepared to find a dispicable, horrid, incomprehenisble film.Instead, I found a bit of Hollywood tripe that follows the usual romantic comedy outline with a bit of Quentin Terrantino thrown in. I didn't think the acting was that attrocious (I've seen worse), or the story that stupid (I've seen worse), though it never really amounted to anything I cared much about either. I really think this film, though it doesn't deserve huge praise, got overbashed just because it was the time when it was proper to dis poor Ben and Jennifer.Can't say I recommmend anyone watch it, but if you do, I don't think you'll come away thinking it's as bad as all the publicity would lead you to believe."
1,"Bad Movies that spells,Gigli.",Comic Book guy from The Simpsons would have a short 3 word sentence that will really go for this:WORST.MOVIE.EVER!!!!LOL!
2,Yes it was bad...,"but DAREDEVIL was worse!! Good job Ben Affleck, you made two terrible movies in the same year!!"
1,This thing is still available on DVD!!!!,"Holy...!!! I thought these discs were all shot into the sun during the last NASA mission. I am an atheist, but even I will say ""For the Love of God, don't buy this movie."""
2,Worth It For The Yoga Scene!,"You know, so much has been said regarding Gigli being a worthless piece of garbage...and well, it almost is, what saves it for me is, first off I LOVE Lainie Kazan. She is a legend and still beautiful woman. Aside from the fabulous Ms Kazan, is that gloriously sexy scene between Afleck and Lopez where they are debating over the female vs male body. Now THAT scene alone was worth the entire movie admission for me! For the record everything Lopez' character said in that scene is 100% correct! The movie could not win any awards for great acting, but, take it for what it's worth and you'll have fun."
2,2 stars for not being boring.,"Only one thing saves Gigli from being the worst movie I have ever seen, and that is that it isn't boring, in the way that watching a drunk sing isn't boring. It's sad, morbid and only slightly funny.The plot--wait, what plot? J.Lo and Ben Affleck cussing, watching people die, J.Lo's established lesbian character suddenly changing to straight(at LEAST they could make her bi, so it would be sort of believable), a death scene, a few terrible ""funny"" scenes...what plot?But hey, it isn't boring, and Ben Affleck is cute."
1,"bad movie, bad actors","Even after the two main characters stay together at the end, the movie left me with a sense of depression and dissatisfaction. What did Al Pachino and Christopher Walken think in playing even the smallest parts in this ""movie""? Such gifted actors do not belong in a film like this. Untalented Ben Affleck who fails to show any kind of emotion on his face and cheap looking JLo who doesn't have any more talent than him make this movie even less appealing."
1,don't ever see it!,This movie was not good at all. I don't think that Jen and Ben should ever do a movie together.They CAN'T act together. And Ben Affleck is overrated. He doesn't act as good as people think he does and Jen is okay! But this movie was stupid and boring! I suggest u don't waste ur money and time on it!
1,Bad,Affleck and Lopez are overexposed and untalented and it shows in this tribute to their 'true love'. BLECK! God love Hollywood for producing this junk and exposing the shear lack of acting ability of both of these... celebrities (calling them actors is an insult to anybody who ever played a tree in their kindergarten play).
2,gobble gobble,"Unlike other reviewers who apparently haven't ever met a Jennifer Lopez film they haven't liked, I profess to more than a little discomfort sitting through this monstrosity. Let's just say it would probably be more entertaining and enjoyable to sit through a double feature of the Care Bears Movie and the Teddy Ruxpin Movie (1999) than this heap. Why? Acting, plot, chemistry.. shout out of anyone spots these, they do a great job hiding. The only nominal performances go to Walken and Pacino, aptly chagrined at the display of their talents like guys who mistakenly wear tuxedos to a monster truck rally. I've seen this film compared to 'Glitter' and 'Crossroads' and that's pretty accurate; it's an awkward derivative ego piece ironically showcasing all the wrong aspects of its purported stars. Joanie and Chachi had more chemistry, and probably will have had longer staying power. Here's hoping Hollywood's next reigning couple shows up sooner rather than later."
3,so bad it's good!,"ok. so i'm one of the people that got this movie (i purchased it) for just a little mor ethen i could have rented it. and seriously, i've seen it about 6 times now! this movie is not as horrible as everyone says. there are some redeaming moments, some cute, some legitamately funny. but this movie really is so bad it's good. it's one of those movies that you should get drunk with friends and watch. make it a double feature with ""dirty love""!"
1,"Actually, I rate this a -5 stars",Movie theatres in my area cut showings down to one a day just one 2 weeks after its release. Even people that buy one ticket and stay all day watching movies didn't watch this one. I was told at the ticket booth not to waste time or money and saw something else.
5,Good Film,"I am not stupid (I got a 1500 on the SATs) but I thought this film was alright. Jen looks very good as does Ben. There are some bad scenes (Ben's mom getting poked with a needle in the butt, Ben going ""moo,"" etc.) but it was okay. I rented it because I heard the hype was so bad and i wanted to see how bad it was. But it wasn't so bad at all. I have seen many films (eg. The Pledge, Snatch, Phonebooth) that were less entertaining. I liked it, okay? It is not that awful. Rent it now."
1,JLo Who?,"I totally lost respect for both Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck after this movie. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!! The movie was bad from the very beginning, and just got worse and worse. For two such fine actors, these were definitely there worst performances to date. It had no plot, was deeply disturbing, and is definitely a moment of my life that I don't want to always remember. Save yourself the money- pick another movie to buy!!!"
1,BLECH,"I got this movie for Christmas, and since I'm a huge Ben Affleck fan I was excited to see it. WASTE OF TIME! I can't believe the budget for this movie was $40 million. The movie was shot in less than 5 locations, and they all sucked. And the ""turkey time"" line??? Get a life!! Honestly one of the worst movies I've seen in a VERY long time."
1,CINEMATIC CRAP!!!!!!!!!,"I'm a masochist,but even I could'nttake the pain of watching this trash.That James Dean guy who called us sheepis actually Ben Affleck's mom!"
1,Don't watch this movie!!!!,"And I thought Battleship Earth and Pluto Nash were bad, until this. This movie was painful to watch. I'm glad I didn't have to shell out any money to see this atrocity or I would have been outraged. I am still upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life viewing something that I wish I could un-see. Do yourself a favor and stick needles under your fingernails instead of watching this movie, it'll be less annoying. And by the way, there should be a ""zero star"" rating for things of this class."
1,Gigli is what hell would look like on screen,"This is the worst and most pathetic piece of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. I simply do not know where to start. Who ever wrote the script deserves to live in poverty for the rest of his/her life ( I think it's a her). The acting was completely miserable and Ben and Jennifer stumble thru this film ( I tremble to even call it a ""Film"") with not one likeable attribute! I wish they were killed in the middle of the film, at least it would have subtracted another worthless hour of this mess. Al pacino does his usual over-the-top performance and it's the first time I wish he died in this film too. PLEASE do not watch this movie!! I would like to sue the director of this movie on grounds of psychological torture and reoccuring nightmares about Ben and Jennifer making another movie together. My IQ score went down a few points because of this movie, so will yours!"
4,Some Smudging of ink happens,"I bought this product because of low pricing. It arrived in time. The packaging was excellent. Installing this cartridge was very easy. The brightness of the black imprint is very good. I have seen some problems however. When a stack of several pages printed, some ink shows on the page above. Also I noticed occasional smudging, making it less sharp. I hope these issues will go away after few days."
1,Cat6 STP Does NOT Fit in These,"Even though the product says it is for Cat 6+, Cat6 STP does NOT fit through the holes. If you are able to shove the strands one at a time at just the right angle and pressure, it will strip a little of the plastic coating off and push through. However, getting all 8 of them through is a time-consuming, next-to-impossible feat."
5,GET IT!!!,"one of the best momus albums.its a good introduction to his earlier work,since he's gone into another musical direction these days.can't wait for his new collaboration with anne laplantine.just get it!!!"
1,Just didn't make sense to me at all,Lemay didn't make sentse much of the time. Much of the problem is with the presentation and lack of insights. I agree with others who said you should get Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Reference Professional Edition instaed.
2,Rubber trimming falls apart in 2.5 years.,"The watch has been good to me as I travelled to countries and gone skiing. I am able to see my altimeter and compass as a guide to know how high and where I was.A few months after I go this watch as a gift, I found the same watch (but used) on sale at the REI Used Gear sale. The reason why the previous owner returned it was because the side rubber trimming of the watch was peeling off. After 2.5 years using the watch, mine is experiencing the same problem. Needless to say, I was not shocked that it happened because of what I saw at the REI Used Gear sale.For a watch over $150, I would expect a better quality than that, especially when it's suppose to be an outdoor watch implying that it should be durable."
5,A Must For Collector or Dealer,This book is the single most valuable book in my collection. I am a retired dealer and avid collector. This book started me off with both adventures. I would/will recommend this book as the best source available. Thank you Ms. Weatherman!!!
3,Nice but not what the online manual says,I bought this to do house parties. The unit functions nice but the typos in the descriptions found around the internet are horrendous. First this unit has only dual ipod inputs. Not a usb and dual ipod inputs. Second there is only one light...That is the power light. The little white buttons do not light up nor are they green as stated in the manuals you can see online. They do not flash. The price is good for the quality of the product. It does a nice job of music tone and control of the ipods back and forth. You could do worse.
5,The best Kreutzer Sonata ever recorded !,"This Sonata is the crown jewel of a CD filled of musical treasures .I have not ever heard such wildness, eloquency , nuance, commitment and dramatic mood in a previous Kreutzer ; and believe me , I have got the Casadesus - Francescati , Menuhin Kempff , and Szigetti - Arrau .The approach given for both monster musicians is out of this world .Radiant , magnificent and sublime . A historical and monumental recording."
5,Appreciation of the different styles,"This book is amazing, although it doesn't have all of the songs from the film it has a wide variety of styles. Silver fingered fling is very energetic compared to The pedalling ankle. The most beautiful is Big my secret , the way it combines the slow but flowing melodies with the scale like interludes is very impressive. The heart asks pleasure first is the main them of the film but it is never played the way which is written in this book, which combines the different variations into one incredibly atmospheric theme."
2,Another book full of rubbish,"If you are into the whole 'Amityville' thing then you will probably like this book, but be warned, it is full of half truths, lies and ridiculous conspiracy theories involving a pretend ex wife of Ronnies."
2,Careful with hot liquids,I got this for hot tea at work.It gets soft with hot liquids so I have to be careful to support the cup from the bottom as well as not gripping it too tightly. It's not a safe feeling when you have very hot water that could spill on you if you don't handle the cup right.And as the other reviewer said top edge (where you drink) isn't completely rolled up so it's not smooth.And the cups tend to stick to each other and you have to play with it to separate.So in the end it's too much work and too flimsy to recommend. The environmentally friendly aspect is the only thing going for it. And really I feel ashamed as I'm writing this that I don't just get regular mugs from home and wash them...
1,Don't even rent it.,"I rented this dvd first, thinking it would be at least as good as the Mischief series, which are not really that good to begin with. Well, this was like watching late night girls gone wild commercials with cars mixed in. The morals have been dropped. The cars are a secondary aspect of this dvd. The primary is to tease your lustful desires and promote the promiscuous agenda of Hollywood reality tv shows. It's garbage."
4,Making the DRY drinkable,"I recall with anguish over 37 years ago, my 10th grade geometry class, dry as a Wadi in the Sahara. I slept through the first course obtaining a grade worthy of my snoring through an hour a day of irrelevance.Today some math teachers are asking why math has to be dull or academic. This book is one which revives my faith a math teacher may indeed have real blood pumping in their veins.This book I'd recommend to some teenagers and more so for adults, those 18 years and up who slept through geometry in high school.I also recommend the basics of geometry start in school much earlier than grade 10.I suspect however geomerty and real dummies don't mix well. Read this book and surprise yourself, maybe you're not a dummie after all."
3,no workbook? no tests?,"Ms. Arnone, your explanations are excellent, but whyaren't there any self-tests or a workbook? What's the pointof learning a bookfull of stuff and not remembering anythingwhen you're finished?"
3,I can't get enough,"I once found the Ginger butter at Walmart, it smelled so refreshing, usally I'm not someone who wears fragance but this is one product that I would recommend. There is nothing overpowering about this scent, Even though the moisterizing properties are great without the aroma, it's light and floral and I loved to wear it like as perfume. Unfortunately, I was never able to find the same scent at Walmart, as far as I know Tree Hut isn't advertising it as a product anymore hopefully they don't stop making this wonderful butter."
3,Okay but don't be overweight much,"Dr. Evil is supposed to be a little paunchy, but this costume doesn't allow for that. Just be prepared if you aren't in grade school anymore."
2,A Robust Bouquet With No Succulent Aftertaste,"I enjoyed this book. But I have seen better (and much worst) satires of self-help and of American values. This book lacks the mordancy and scathing hilarity of THANK YOU FOR SMOKING; I enjoyed it, had a few good laughs, but would not buy it for friends or recommend it. Satire it is, and good satire, but much much closer to such ""non-books"" as 10001 Uses for a Dead Cat, or THE RULES OF DUCT TAPE, than to the best satiric books which earn a permanent place on our book-shelves.This vintage, finally, is too light and frothy and a little ""too"" easy. I missed the mad brilliance I have seen in Buckley's other books and think that perhaps I would have rated this book higher if the author's other work had not given me such gleeful expectations."
4,Almost as good as Thank You For Smoking,"One of Buckley's best books and a fantastic satire for those that are sick of hearing about how to get rich quick and ""synergize"" on the job. Buckley pokes fun at every popular self-help guru out there, along with all of us that take our professional lives a bit too seriously . . . One of the few books that has made me laugh out loud."
3,The flaming cliffs,"This book tells the tale of Roy Chapman Andrews. He was an outdoors man, who talked his way into the American Museum of Natural History, and eventually becomes the director there. Andrews has the strong belief that the human race originated in Asia instead of the more common belief of Africa. Andrews is able to find backing to fund trips of Asia and Mongolia to find proof to back up his belief.Even though the writing is a little dry, I found the subject to be very interesting. The details of the expeditions, how they were funded, supplied and got to the sites were fascinating. Dealing with the different governments in Asia, at a time of revolution, was also of interest.I would have enjoyed more information into the science of the expeditions, but that may be a subject for a different book. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the age of exploration. It is not a light read, but worth the time."
1,author wrote all these reviews!!!,"Talk about desperate self-promotion.Have a look at all these reiews, this is the only book they've reviewed,except some who reviewed a P. Cornwell book only to add a link to this one.Cheap, cheap , cheap trick Dania Deschamps, no one's that stupid."
5,Great Show!,"Simply my favorite television show of all time. We may of lost Cuddy in this series, but on such a note to truly set the tone for the character House."
5,best,Best of the best. Every season was better then the one before. I wish I could say the things he says.
2,The Year I gave Up on House,"I have been a faithful watcher of House. The first few seasons were 4 stars, but thereafter the decline has been slow but steady. This year was so preposterous, disappoointing, and lacking in intensity that my wife and I gave up somewhere near the mid-point. There is no need to go into great details, but the soap opera became so ludicrous as to be laughable. A pity to see this once fine series run out of true creativity."
1,Disc problems,"I'm not sure if this product was used, repackaged and sold as a new one but the discs had scratches that made the show skip."
5,What a nail biter,"I love this item as well and again, it was shipped in a very timely manner. I am always pleased when I buy something off amazon. go team! Only once have I ever had to complain. keep up the great work!"
2,"Sorry, But I Didn't Like it","What has happened to the series in Season 7 is just so sad. And I don't mean House's relapse and the loss of his relationship with Cuddy. I mean - bad writing, bad direction, losing an intern who would have been a big bonus to this show, relying on gimmicky scenes to move the story forward (see the episode ""Bombshells"" - did we really need House's versions of 'Butch Cassidy', 'All that Jazz', and some ancient TV shows?). I could go on and on. It's just so sad.I love ""House"", I adore Hugh Laurie, I've never missed an episode in 7 seasons, and I'll keep watching through Season 8. But, in my humble, unimportant opinion , this series was the antithesis of all that was good in Seasons 1 through 6.Please, writers and producers, get your creative imagination back. Your fans are waiting."
5,I love this show.,"My boyfriend and I are both big House fans. He has seasons 1-6, so for Christmas I'm surprising him with seasons 7 & 8. This arrived only a few days after I ordered it. Very happy."
5,Very Easy to Install,I bought this hitch and installed it with no problem it was very easy and it works great!!
3,Disappointing,"I have loved the other Angela Huth's novels, Wives of the Fisherman, and Land Girls, and was disappointed with the gravity of this one. Am a compulsive ""finisher,"" but had to prod myself along and found it wanting in content. She always writes beautifully about relationships but this, for me, just wasn't a very engaging story. Sorry."
3,Hisonic Wireless microphones,I love it because it's UHF and has crazy range. I don't because when I had it on for a while it started to go in and out.
5,really good mic almost like the studio,really fast shipping this mic works great. only one complaint it said that it came with a shock mount kit but there was only the shock mount it didnt come with the stand other than that. gets the job done thats for shure i rate this 5 stars go ahead and buy this you wont regret it
4,"Clear, but a pain to put on","These covers for the Palm M100/M105 are clear and you don't really notice any difference in screen clarity. However, the instructions say to use the provided card to apply the covers. The card is bigger than my M105 screen, and no matter what, I had annoying bubbles under the cover. After 6 attempts, I tossed the provided card and used my index finger, and it worked perfectly. No bubbles, and perfect adherence. Only thing is that the cover does not fit the screen exactly. It is a couple of ML smaller, which can be a bit annoying for applications that scroll, where you need to tap the edge of the screen. These minor inconveniences make up for scratches in the future, and costly screen replacement."
3,Good CD,"I expected more, even after listening to the preview tracks...'Are You The One?' and 'Girl in the Sea' are great tracks, to me they're the saving grace of an otherwise forgettable album.A lot of instrumentals that get a little repetitive, but better than a lot of other stuff out there. They do acheive some creative sequencing from time to time."
1,Terribly Expensive -- Yes Both,Shell fell apart after about one month. Very hard to refill -- nothing about this was easy or good. Now having a hard time returning it. Sigh.
2,"Never Used, Wrong Instructions","Purchased for my wife, needed one with ceramic grinding for wet sea salt. Product had the wrong instructions included, called Amazon & got a replacement-same problem. As we wanted to be sure this would work for Sea salt & directions were for Peppermill & cleaning/care instructions appeared to be very specific, we returned it also. Disappointed in this buying experience from Amazon. But gladwe didn't keep it as we found out it probably wouldn't have worked for true Sea salt which is damp & would get clogged up in the grinding mechanism. also wasn't crazy about the fact it took 6 AAA batteries to power."
5,"Authenticity, variety and musicianship.","""What sweeter music can we bring than a carol!"" So sing the Deller Consort on Track 19 of this delightful CD. 25 carols are heard, dating in time from C14th Germany to C19th America. Four pioneering members of the Deller Consort are heard, and accompaniments are sometimes provided by recorder and lute. If you are old enough to have possessed these recordings in their original early stereo format, you'll notice that the sound is much cleaner, with most but not all background hum erased. Additional items have been poached from other Deller Consort LP releases to bring the duration of this CD to 60 minutes.Concerns for authenticity, variety and musicianship are all met here. Liner notes include a history of the English carol by Russell Hope Robbins and a personal appreciation provided by Alfred Deller's son Mark."
5,The Essential Jerome Kern,"Once again George Feyer has proved he is a concert pianist. The way he plays Kern reveal not only his great musicality, but also his great musical culture and taste. He uses to improvise slightly including some familiar themes from his favorite Chopin and other composers in his accompaniment. All recordings are perfectly remastered and sound beautifully. This album is a must for every collector of popular music. Both thumbs up! We are still waiting for more Feyer (his series of ""Echoes..."" (of Broadway, Hollywood, Paris, Budapest, Rome etc.), which made him famous in America."
3,too punkish,this is punk music with hardcore vocals... not that good... I wasn't impressed at all...tried to get into this and I just couldn't not my cup of tea... maybe its yours...
2,Disappointing...,"I was expecting a better book considering the glowing reviews. I'm about 3/4 finished and wish I had not bothered. Its become predictable and boring. Anyone with a medical or computer background would think the main idea of the book is unrealistic. I agree with one of the other reviews regarding the book's omission of what the boy is experiencing, it would've been much more interesting."
2,Not What I Expected,"My daughter love Sharon, Lois, and Bram! We have the Make Believe DVD and they watch is all the time! I thought that they would also love this DVD. I was so very wrong. The Make Believe DVD is made like a show with skits. This was more of a live concert. My children wouldn't even watch 5 minutes of this. It was a waste of time and money. I don't recommend this unless your child enjoys live concert."
4,LARNELLE Unbelievable Love,"Larnelle continues to bring inspiration and encouragement through his distinct music and God-given voice. The ""Unbelievable Love"" CD contains a gem of a song entitled ""I Look To You"" which is NOT offered on any other album. Other favorites include ""Unbelievable Love""; ""I Don't Know Why You Love Me"" and ""Cross The Line."""
1,Don't get this one!,"Just like other reviewers, this monitor prevented us from using our laptop on our wireless network...can you say ""BUHBYE?"" I'm really disappointed FP would sell such an unreliable item."
4,Brief overview of what happens.,"Episode 31 - Countdown to DestructionTak sees Natalie in a Mercedes with another guy. Pissed off, Tak gets to Mt. Akagi filled with rage and begins to race. The 86 battles the overpowered Evo, which contains the legendary mis-firing system.Episode 32 - Goodbye Eight-SixDuring the epic race, Tak suffers from the difference in horsepower. While he wins a little distance in the cornering, he loses the lead in the straight-aways. Bunta begins to worry about Tak.Episode 33 - Battle at AkagiIggy tells Tak he is going to go watch Ry's and Kyle's battle. It's a battle between the epitome of motor sports technique and the essence of mountain battle technique."
3,ingenious yarn,Great work by the author in detailed research on NY circa 1909 and more importantly of the Freud/Jung split and visit to..NYC..clever and very enjoyable..jungians will not be pleased..but as someone who admires Jung I was not offended and suspect the critique is correct..I will leave to others better informed to opine!
2,The Interpretation of Mediocraty,"This book was given to me as a gift and I appreciated it...as a gift. As a read, it was on par with John Grishom (not a compliment). Mr. Rubenfeld writes with some style and interest, it was not a snoozer of a read but it was one that once I picked it up I was already thinking about putting it down after a couple of pages.His take on Freud's trip to New York was interesting, he obviously did some good research there but this book was obviously his own dream of meeting Freud and impressing his mentor. As mentioned in other reviews, sadly not much of a thriller either.In conclusion, the writing style was ok, the story concept was ok, the thrill was below par and the overall novel lacked any real imagination. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a 1 star because that is reserved for the worst. It's not a 3 star because despite the above a 3 star would include a recommendation whereas this one does not."
2,"Terrible character development, stupid plotting","Ugh. I've gotten to the final 30 pages and cannot believe where this is going. What a terribly plotted book. And characters are just bare sketches on the page. Connections to 'Hamlet' go nowhere. It seems as if the author is simply showing off a certain amount of knowledge (oh, I see, he drops his Julliard School credit into his frontpiece bio -- so, what does that mean, he audited a Shakespeare class??). Two stars because he is able to string sentences together. Cheesy."
3,"A worthy read, but not a keeper","I recently read this book. The photography was excellent. In other respects, I was a bit disappointed. I had not realized the international scope of the book and found that I wanted more detail; more pictures of the stations selected and more words on the station details. In a sense, it, perhaps, should have been a multi-volume set, w. different volumes set in different regions of the world, or, maybe, volumes covering different time periods. The author's desire to cover such a broad geography and time period meant that his space to provide detail was extremely limited.While well worth my careful reading and review, I didn't have the sense that I need to keep this volume in my personal library; it just didn't have enough depth."
3,need an open mind,You really need an open mind for this one. I don't agree with everything inside it. Concepts and conclusions are flawed and or incorrect.However the meditation exercises are worth reading.
4,Out of Nowhere,"For an artist that almost nobody has heard of, this album should put him on the map. Songs like ""Space Cowboy"" and ""Night Falls"" keeps your feet stomping as the beat goes on. This is one of the few CD's that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track. All the songs are mellow and flow well taking you on a lyrical journey."
2,"Too short, only covers the very basics","I didn't like this book because I didn't learn anything out of it. I suppose a person completely new to technical analysis could find this book somewhat useful, but I thought it was near useless. The biggest drawdown is that the author does not even use a single real-life chart. Only made-up charts that will never show up like this in real life (especially the volumes he draws are ridiculously far from real-life situations). Plus, he uses bar charts, which I hate. I think candlestick charts are much better and easier to read, but that's my personal opinion.Other than that, this book was a big deception. There are much much better technical analysis books out there, and this one simply doesn't stand up. I think the guy thought he could make some quick bucks considering he's a TV anchor or something. Well, in any case, don't buy this book. I'm glad I borrowed it at the library."
2,Another Me Too Book on TA,"This book is another ""Me Too"" book on technical analysis. This book is very short and concise. There is a section with problems and solutions. However, in the REAL world, most patterns are not as clear-cut as those in the book. Why doesn't the author use REAL examples? Unlike those previous reviewers with the fancy-schmancy titles, I'm just your everyday average trader and would really need a thicker book with real examples and more explanations. And unlike those other reviewers, I have also reviewed more than one book."
1,Curtaint,"Was a waste of time and money. I thought that it was going to be one piece, and not two connected with a piece pf plastic. It could not even hold up the curtain made of polyester. Did not even try to put the linner on because it bowed so much in the middle. As of right now I will never buy or suggest anyone to purchase anthing from Amazon. The product is a rip off and was worthless. A waste of about $100 with the shipping, ect. This is why people should not purchase anything from the internet. I did not send it back, because I did not have to go through a long song and dance!!!David Coe 954-270-4103"
2,Other Books,"No idea why the relatives ever bought me this, but I read it. Big trucks and mining in the middle of nowhere is not for me."
4,Nursery Toy,We have this toy at our church nursery and all the little ones from crawling to age two love to play with this toy. It is extremely durable. Dozens of kids play with it every week and it's been in the nursery for years.
3,Disappointed,"The book was ok, I'm really into the near death experience books and this one was alright. I have read all the new NDE's books that have come out in the last year and I recommend two other one's ""My Last Breath"", by Matthew Dovel, and ""While out of My Body"", by Dr. Roger Roger Shankle Mills."
3,A Heavenly Visit,"This is the remarkable story of a young girl named Katie,who is visited by her brother who has passed on. Her brother takes her on a journey to Heaven,where she learns what happens to souls after they leave Earth.During her visits, Katie finds that, contrary to what a lot of people think, the afterlife is a progression of learning experiences where our souls continue the everlasting process of growth. Not only are with reunited with our loved ones, we share in their everlasting happiness."
2,Almost taken in,"Having read several other books on out-of-body and near-death experiences, I was at first drawn into the tale that was being woven. That came sharply to a halt when the author depicted Jesus speaking to a group of departed souls in sixteenth century English. Give me a break!"
1,Does not work,"Bottom line, Save your money and stay away from this memory card.After buying a new Cannon digital camera, I started looking around for a reasonably priced SD or SDHC card. Sandisk and other recognizable brand names were selling for about $30 at brick and mortar stores. So I decided to check online and found some great deals on Amazon. It did cross my mind that the prices might be too good to be true.I should have listened to my inner voice. After receiving the Kingston 4 gb sdhc in the mail, I put it into my camera. The camera showed 3.9 GBs available. That's fine, I thought. So I took a couple of shots and was able to review them. Then I turned the camera off and that's when the trouble began. When I turned on the camera a few hours later, the camera displayed a memory card error. Removing the card and re-seating did not work. Wiping the connectors on the card did not work. Nothing I did fixed the problem, except going out and buying a new card."
2,Slower than Class 4,"I bought this thinking that it would be fast enough for my camcorder, since it was rated at Class 6. It is slower than my Class 4 cards and will not even support Windows Ready Boost. Invest in some other brand."
2,Two 8GB Cards Failing,"I bought these 8GB cards in combination with a Canon A640 for use on my honeymoon. Were working ok until a video recording went awry. Now both old and new videos/images are showing up with ""Unidentified Image"" errors on both cards. Viewing many images/videos on a computer shows serious banding and image integrity problems. Not sure if it is the camera or both cards causing the problems, but being on the honeymoon I will not waste time trying to find out."
1,bad quality,This item was openned when it came to me. They should have told me that this item was used. The return process back to Amazon was quick and simple
4,All around good card. I'll buy more.,"The card performs just fine, and works as expected. 8GB is perfect for an 8Mp camera, giving 2290 pictures at the best settings. It has a hardware lock to prevent accidents. I/O to my computer is VERY fast, but it could be because of, or along with, the SanDisk MicroMate SD/SDHC USB widget I also bought.I took off one star for the paper label; it adds just a tiiny bit more thickness, which gets tight in the camera. In a few months, I'm sure grooves will wear in the paper. Not a deal-breaker; would (will?) buy more."
4,Works Just Fine,"I've used a couple of these cards, both in my Elph Camera and in my Kindle, and they have worked just fine. No problems to report. When I bought it on Amazon, the price was competitive, but always be sure to shop around a bit."
5,Best Air Freshener,"I've been buying the Parsley (Bathroom & Kitchen areas) plus the Cinnamon (Living Room area)for about 3 years now and am never disappointed with the performance. These work better than leaving a candle burning for hours and the scent is entirely healthy, non aerosol. You can feel the freshness even when inhaling once it's been sprayed. I also like the fact I can get it a little cheaper through Amazon with the subscribe & save plan (about ever 6 months I go through a box). It would be great if Earth Friendly Products came out with a Basil version as well, I'd definitely try it. I prefer more cleaner scents (less perfume-y) and these are it. I've yet to find a comparable air freshener I like better."
2,The Hammer to the Square Peg,"The author devotes his attention to the philosophies underpinning the Declaration of Independence. As a scholar of philosophy, Morton does an interesting job of delving into the philosophical origins of words and ideas to parse the text to arrive at their meanings. But this is his problem: he avoids many currents, such as republicanism and the fears and historical motivations behind radical Whig philosophy. Whether by design or ignorance, the book falls into a turgid philosophical exegesis. The conclusion of the book offers a hint to the author's intent when addressing the proper bounds and aims of government. It appears that the square peg would go through the round hole by sheer force of willful ignorance. Ah, socialism!!"
5,"Sprusso from Katonah, NY",Thanks for another fabulous cookbook! I bought your first one & loved trying the diverse array of recipes. Everything came out so delicious! I look forward to doing the same with your second book. I tried my first dish last night - the cornflake crusted sea bass with salsa. I have already loved cornflake crusted chicken and was pleasantly surprised it came out so yummy with the sea bass. The corn and black bean salsa was a nice compliment to the dish. I love how you blend ingredients together to give food such wonderful flavors. Keep it up! Looking forward to Beef Stew Provencal this weekend!
4,Definitely worth reading,"I never read poetry and I am not a fan of Michael Madsen as an actor per se. But I'm so glad I've discovered his writing. Michael Madsen doesn't describe himself as a writer, more a ""recorder of life"". Stuck in another city while making a movie and away from his family, he writes a lot about trivial daily stuff and sometimes more philosophical thoughts. For me, he's the best though at writing about boredom. His little stories can make you laugh or move you, and they are so striking and vivid that they make you feel that you are, as well, stuck in a hotel somewhere with bright neon lights outside, and you've just run out of whiskey. I'm not giving 5 stars because some of his stories are plain and ordinary, just like real life. But most of them will stay with you for a long time."
5,"Do not let the word ""poetry"" keep you from experiencing this great book...","This is not your ordinary ""roses are red, violets are blue..."" type poetry. Michael's work is great. Take this from me, a person who really dislikes reading, this book is a must have!!!!!!!!!!! I started reading Michael's book and I could not put it down. His writings can make you rethink things, laugh, and even cry at times. He is honest and raw, a true mans man with a soft side. A father, a family man, an actor, a poet; Michael is so great at all he does and it is truly a shame that most people only see him as Mr. Blonde. (originally written February 9, 2006)"
1,Beware!,"Beware everyone! This book discusses the ""M"" word quite frequently as well as the author's struggle to overcome it. I thought this would be a good book for a young teen, but the content in my opinion is quite offensive. If you are looking for a Godly book for your kids, keep looking."
3,"Good, but ...","This book is quite good, but not perfect. You should read ""Every man's battle"" by Stephen Arterburn.Those two books complement each other and you need to read the other one if you want a whole perspective. However, If I'd have to choose one of them, I prefer Stephen's one."
1,A little something of nothing,"Should have been called, ""Some biomechanical considerations in tennis technique"". Even this suggests a bit more than this book actually has. No models, no physics (all existent models are incomplete and they are not worth mentioning, according to the author). One looking for forces, moments, conservation of energy, etc. would be totally disappointed. But then, so would be a six grader's tennis coach who skipped physics in high school, because there is nothing in this book he wouldn't know already.I regard it as pretty much useless, I don't even get what type of reader is the author targeting with it."
4,Vangelis' Greek side is refreshing.,"This recording by Irene Papas and Vangelis is reminescent of ""Heaven and Hell"", but with more of a Greek sound. The album is both soothing and energizing, and it is one of Vangelis' more unique performances. Definitely worth it."
2,Not at all 1988,"This album is a little more like 1998. Nothing at all original except the beats on ""tramp"" and ""big girls..."" I was hoping this album would rival some of the soul position/greenhouse effect stuff that he did but it doesnt even come close. I appreciate the effort in trying to bring the 1988 sound back, but music was original back then. Theres nothing classical or groundbreaking about this album. I hate to say it, but this is Blueprint at his worst."
5,These beats are killa!,"I'm not a ""paid"" reviewer, I just went to the CD Release party and bought the cd because a friend told me to. Thank goodness.It was one of the best concerts I've ever heard in my life! The CD made it that much better. I have to say that Tramp and Big Girls Need Love Too are my two favorite tracks off of this disk.Can't wait to see The Lab Rats and Blue Print at Comfest 05!"
5,CMu professor?,Does anyone know if this is the same Sterling Johnson who is a political science prof. at CEntral Michigan University? I sure hope so! Let me know...
2,Product not nessacarily the one described here!,"They didnt post my last review i guess they didnt like what I had to say. Product I recieved looks ok, have not used it yet but it does look rather cheaply made, the pack will probably not stand up to packing it full for more than a day. It is not what was described. It is one Compartment (no sep. compartment for sleeping bag only a zipper at the bottom for access to the main compartment) pockets for drink will not hold average nalgene, no rain cover as advertised. Product does not match that described by others either. Now that I have returned to review there is a new picture completely different from the one i purchased and recieved oh but same spects, and product reviews are posted as before.....hm I find that interesting."
5,Good Read,I always enjoy reading Dick Francis novels. The horse racing world is a fascinating sport and I think the steeplechase jockeys are slightly crazy to jump and such speed.
4,Horses and detecting,The second Sid Halley book. Sid investigates horses who don't run to form.Along with a good story line there are the usual interesting characters.This is one of the better books by a really great author.
5,very fun and versatile,"This is a great toy. It has three different positions and is VERY easy to change around. I think the designer is brilliant! My 7-month old is going back and forth between the lay down and sit-and-play positions right now. I have no doubt that he will love the toy in it's third stage-- stand up and play. The only thing I would change has already been mentioned: the volume is very loud. There are two volume choices: loud and very loud. No big deal, though, I just muffled the speaker with tape."
3,Great for older kids,We got this toy for my niece. When we first got home it was almost impossible for us to put together for her! The little things hanging down would NOT clip on even when two grown men tried.It's sat collecting dust for over a year and finally now that she's two she's starting to play with it in it's upright position and has fun hitting the piano keys.
3,like discontinued model better,"i like the discontinued sparkling symphany better than this new piano. the volume control on it is worthless, i find the chorus voices very irritating and when in beginner mode it takes a very hard kick to the dangly things to get it to do any thing. i liked the light up keys better than the light up stars. i do like that you can change the angle and mode on it for different ages. i much preferred the classical music only on the sparkling symphany to the changed musical choices. -lisa"
5,Almost 2 and still loves it...,"We received this as a baby shower gift. Now my daughter is almost 2, and still loves it! She switches the mode around so sometimes she creates her own song, then she'll switch it to auto-play songs - and will sing along! It is also very durable - we leave it on all the time and have only changed the batteries twice. I would recommend supervising with a climber, however, as we have caught her several times using it as a stepstool to get onto a table, dresser, or into her crib. But despite that, it is still standing strong! Any toy that will entertain for this long is an excellent investment."
5,Great toy so far,"Our daughter is 2 months old, and she has had this toy for a couple of weeks now. I can already see her developing! In the beginning she was hitting the hanging toys by default, since she was waving her arms from the excitement induced by the music. Now it seems that even if she accidently hits one of the rattles, for example, she actually keeps her hand on it to continue hearing it rattle. I am curious to see how she enjoys it when she grows. Great toy!"
5,A developmental toy with lasting power,"My daughter recieved this as a gift when she was about a month old. It has been a true joy to watch her discover and master all the ways to play with it. I still remember when she started kicking at the ornaments and then the day when she began nailing them to get the specific sound she wanted. At every stage she has loved playing with this. Fisher Price has done a great job at making this maintain the interst of a baby. She is now 12 months old and still plays with it, in the upright mode, almost daily. It has truly helped foster her love of music."
4,Another great purchase!,"We bought this for our daughter; she's now 8 months old. She loves it. She's now crawling and the first thing she goes for is her ""piano"". She loves all the stars and would rather eat the toy then really play with it. I would highly recommend this toy though for any parent who has a child who loves music!"
3,"cute toy, but makes my happy baby cry","This seems like it would be a really fun toy with good music and lots of color and lights, but every time I put this toy in front of my 6 month old baby she starts crying. I have an easy-going, laid-back, happy baby so I'm not sure why this toy would upset her, but I'm guessing it's over stimulating her, causing her to feel stressed-out."
5,Keeps him busy for hours!!,"This product is great. I found that if i put my 11 week old in his bouncy seat and put this over it so that he can reach the keys, he'll pound on it and get all excited to see the lights go when he hits them. Also! He'll kick the things that lay down with his feet and get exercise with it. The volume is quiet enough, too, that it's not one of those 'annoying noisy toys'. I do wish it were a little smaller, but if it was, it wouldn't fit over his bouncy seat so well!"
3,nice calming center,I bought this for my 5 month old son and he just feel in love with it now he's 11 months and still loves to play with it. he even uses it like a walker. he learned how o walk fatser with this then his own walker we bought him. i even bought one as a gift for my nephew how's now 5 months old .it's worth it.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,LOVE THIS PRODUCT. SIMPLE TO USE AND WORKS GREAT!!MULTIPLE SIZES TPYE AND MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF TAPE AVAILABLE AT GOOD PRICE.
4,Work flawlessly,"Other than an initial Battery warning which seems to be a false positive the first time you put in new batteries, it has been working great. I have to fend off my middle child from borrowing it too often."
1,Not a good buy at any price,"While the P-Touch has a number of nice, handy features, reliability and durability aren't among them. Mine initially worked quite well for very light home office duty, but after a few months it dropped dead. I made certain to switch the power off regularly and remove the batteries when it was not in use. [...]. This item is made in China, so I guess I should have considered the poor quality of goods made there when I purchased this. Suffice to say if the manufacturer doesn't stand behind their own product then this is NOT a brand you should be buying. There are other brands that make label makers and I would STRONGLY suggest looking at their products first!"
2,Battery eater!,"Can not keep batteries in this thing. Use it, it eats batteries, don't use it, it eats batteries, think about using it, it eats batteries. Did I mention it eats batteries? I finally gave up, buy one that plugs in."
4,Easy to use label maker,"This is a great little label system. East to use, clear print, some cool graphics. It is a little bulky in your hands. All in all excelant label machine for the price and really easy to use."
2,"Great features, horrible battery life","This product has great features, is easy to use, and has a fantastic form factor.It's easy to make nice labels, they look great when they print, and it has a handy groove to help you separate the label from its backing after you cut it off.HOWEVER, it has a huge flaw: the battery life is horrible. It would be one thing if ""horrible"" meant having to replace them once a month. If you use this device daily, you will be replacing them every 2 or 3 days. Sometimes I put in brand new batteries, that maybe aren't straight from the store but have been sitting in a drawer for a few months, and after I print the FIRST label, I get the low battery indicator.For the price, the design and features of this product are PERFECT. However, I would not recommend this product to anyone, only because of the battery life."
3,Slightly incomplete,"For general knowledge of insurance terms I guess this is an adequate dictionary and nevertheless needed for understanding insurance terms. I find however that being IN the insurance business as a newcomer and needing to have all my insurance words defined, this dictionary lacks many terms used, at least on the Life insurance side of it, so leaves me grasping for other sources and references to find these words which should be defined in this dictionary in the first place."
4,Very useful little reference,"As someone who works with property and casualty insurance a lot, this has been a great reference. It appears more focused on that than life or health insurance, but certainly has some terms from all areas.Occasionally some definitions get bogged down in legalese or finance-speak, but if you read them carefully it's pretty easy to get a good idea. One thing I also love is the dictionary covers a lot of tangentially related teams that can frequently come up in an insurance context."
2,Weak and watery,"I gave this two stars, one for aroma, and one for recyclable paper packaging instead of foil or Mylar.I thought I would give this tea a try since my usual blackcurrant tea was no longer available on AmazonPrime. I was hopeful, and it did smell nice in the bag. I should have known better. I did my usual two bags of tea (a big 20oz. American coffee mug, not a teacup) and when I sampled it I was shocked the water barely changed color. I added two more bags, and even after four bags and a log steep: still, watery, weak color and weak flavored tea that, all right, smelled nice. This brand might be fine for most people who seem to like weak and watery tea, but if you prefer a robust and full flavored tea, stick to Twinings or Ahmed, it'll be worth the wait."
4,Deja Vu,"This short comic collection details the repentance and redemption of Ulic Qel-Droma (Where have we seen a dark Jedi return to the Light side before?). Wandering the galaxy while trying to hide from his past, Ulic ends up becoming the teacher for Vima Sunrider, Nomi's daughter. While blind to the Force, Ulic trains Vima as best he can while Nomi and others track him down. In the end, Ulic must prove that he has the heart of a Jedi and teach others not to live in the past or to hate. The artwork is well done in this comic. I like how Ulic looks, especially. While it is very short, it gives Ulic fans reason to be happy as we see that he has overcome his past troubles. Also recommended: Dark Forces Graphic Novels, Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic, Tales of the Jedi: Dark Lords of the Sith, Tales of the Jedi: The Sith War"
1,"um,Dont think so",THE LAYOUT OF THIS BOOK WAS MORE COMPLICATED THAN ADVANCED ALGEBRA ITSELF.IT IS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE.IT EXPLAINS ALL DIFFERNT ASPECTS OF ALGEBRA YES BUT IT DOES NOT ACCTUALLY EXPLAIN HOW TO COMPLETE A SUM.METHODS ETC.USELESS...
1,DO NOT get this book if you are trying to learn algebra,"Do Not get this book if you are trying to learn algebra. The first half of the book is OK, the basic stuff. Once you get further along there are tons of problems with no explanation AT ALL as to why she is doing certain things in the problem. This is a good book for a refresher, that's it."
1,Short Lifespan,"The filter filled up in less than a month, slowing water pressure to a trickle. Who wants to replace a semi-expensive filter EVERY month? I still use it as a showerhead without the filter, but it's not of the best construction that it would make the price worth it."
2,"Nice case, but look elsewhere if you have the S105!","Nice and soft leather, but the cut-outs don't match the S105! As the other reviewer said, the hole for the speaker is on the wrong side (what was Samsung thinking!), the IR port is covered, mic port is partially covered, and the color screen is left completely unprotected! The top of the keypad is also unprotected, but that's a smaller gripe. I bought a cheaper case elsewhere that fit the S105 perfectly."
1,Can't stand them . . .,"Have never been able to make so much as one Cat 6 cable with these things. Can never get the wires to go through their designated holes without bunching up and I have tried seemingly everything. Instead, I have wound up using them to make Cat 5 cables and they work quite well for doing that. Have to give it one star, because even though I found a use for them it was not the purpose for which they were initially purchased.I have had great success with the Cat 6 connectors that include the little black plastic insert that is placed into the Cat 6 connector. That solution works well for making Cat 6 cables and, in my personal opinion, I would recommend readers pursue that solution instead."
5,great little book great photos,It was exactly what I was expecting. I remember the day my Dodgers won their 1st World Series.A great memory from my childhood.
1,It Doesn't Add Up,"If Maurice Woodruff really knew how to foretell the future, why did he waste his time writing a book that is now out of print and which sells for a lousy 24 cents?"
3,Good for the younger set,"My son got this from his grandmother for Christmas. I had told her to get The Wizard of Oz for him and this is what she sent. I am sure she was unaware that it is an abridged copy - please bear that in mind if you purchase. At first I was disappointed but it ended up being a good thing. My four year old really enjoyed having the story read to him and looked forward to new chapters every night. It's a very simplified version of the story and worked out well for his age. I am buying another copy of the full version though, because I am sure eventually we will want to read that instead."
4,Somerset maughamismness,"I felt this book was interesting and useful in my research concerning the life and work of W. Somerset Maugham. Robin, Somerset's nephew, adds interesting insights into the life and heritage of the Maughams. The book is mainly about Somerset Maughams as well as a genelogy of the Maughams."
4,Electronics well done,"I've had this Radar for a few weeks now and it has responded very well. It does, of course, go off a bit directly in front (within the parking lot) of most stores but that is unavoidable witht he strength of their signal. For the current market of police radar detection it is above the norm."
5,"HEALTHY, Encouraging and TRUE","Stress doesn't kill you: FEAR DOESStress drives you to be dynamic, happy , RICH AND PROUD OF YOUR SELFThis is THE BOOK !!!"
3,"Good product, small size","I just bought a case of these. Despite spending time measuring liquids to get a sense of how large the bowls would be and reading reviews of each size, I finally decided on the 12 oz size to use as cat bowls. When they arrived this week I was surprised at how small they seem, and deep. Cats, at least mine, don't like deep bowls, as their whiskers get messy. But using flat plates meant that half the food wound up on the floor. I needed a happy medium. I found them at CVS, where they don't advertise by ounces but by inches. The 7 inch bowls are larger and flatter, and my cats seem to like them. They are, of course, more expensive, so I will have to use the case of these first."
3,Environmentally usefull,"The bowls save us from using plastic, but hot soup or liquid will heat up the bowl and after atime might break down the fiber. I used it for a Chili supper for 300 people, and everyone likedthe idea of sugar cane fiber to replace plastic or foam bowls. Once people know that the productis green they are more likely to accept it."
1,Pedantic,"Could this be better. Oh yes. let me count the ways. Stilted acting, Poor lighting and what, 15 min. long? Read the poem, you'll get a lot more out of it!!!"
2,quite disappointing,"If you think that because this is: 1) reduced from $50 and 2) made by Seiko, that it is going to me a well made classy item then you may be disappointed. It looks OK but as soon as you handle it it feels quite cheap & flimsy. Plastic can be engineered well but this hasn't been. On mine the front flap does not stay closed.To look on the plus side this is the lightest & thinnest travel clock I could find so if that is important for you then this could be for you.However for me I was hoping the extra cost was going to give a better made clock - and it didn't"
2,Seiko Travel Alarm,"I bought this neat looking little clock for my husband who simply wanted a way to look at the time at night, when he awoke. I read the description of the small clocks on here and owing to the Seiko brand name, I chose this one. In the Amazon online description of the clock, it was described as having ""Lumibrite Arabic hour markers"" and I took that to mean that my husband could glance at the clock face in the dark of night and the clock hands would be visible enough for him to be able to quickly see the time... Not so. We darkened the room and couldn't see the hands. We tried leaving the clock in the dark for several hours to see if it needed ""time to adjust"". Still no visible hands. We gave up on trying and have decided to use it as simply a travel alarm. I might also add that for $38, I thought I was buying a substantial little clock. While this might be true of the clock mechanism, the clock case is very light and had the feel of a much less costly travel alarm."
1,Could be a good game if...,"It could be a good game if it was actually playable, but like it has been mentioned in other rebiews that game just doesn't work. I get kicked out back to the desktop. The game freezzes. The audio sounds like a new born baby mumbling. I've contacted customer support and they act like it is some big suprise that the game does not work. There response was hmmm that is unusual, as if to say I am the only one having a problem. I tried changing the video settings on my computer but nothing has worked. I recomend holding off till 3DO wakes up and realizes something is wrong."
2,"Burns, burns, burns....","I thought I'd try this new hair removal stuff, and since the commercial praised it a lot (well, of course-it's their product!), I went and bought it for the cottage, so I could get my legs in nice shape when I'm walkin' around in my shorts.First off, it made such a big mess, and it was a long cleanup. Secondly, what was it's purpose? To remove hair? More like remove a few hairs. It hardly did it's job. ""Vite vite! Get rid of of the Veet!"", I told myself. So, it was back to the store to find something that really works!"" And I found a winner: Schick's Intuition shaving system. Much, much better. Thanks Schick. That was a close....shave."
3,Bath Sponge,This natural sponge washes off the dead skin cells very nicely. It is just the right size to hold when bathing with your favorite aromatherapy bath soaps. Also washes out the soap and dries to a soft clean sponge. Enjoy !
2,Please read before you buy!!,The sheets are very uncomfortable. They would make better curtains than sheets. Very low count thread. The comforter is just as bad. What a dissapointment. Good thing it was a gift.
4,Das Boot,"This book is terrific for those with an interest in boats and great non-fiction adventure stories. Full of accurate technical details mixed with spell binding suspense. Maybe a little wordy in some areas, but hard to put down."
5,wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book written by an extraordinary author (anyone who has read ""charmed life"" will fully agree with me). Though some of her books are frustrating to read, ""deep secret"" is most definitaly not one of them."
4,YA Edition - beware,"This edition has a gorgeous cover by Charles Vess, but - alas -the text has been edited for a YA audience. Our hero Rupert isno longer referred to by his brothers as scatalogically as inthe unexpurgated text... but the deaths mentioned by anotherreviewer remain just as graphic. Weird editing decisions... whycut a rude word and leave the really scary stuff? There are someother minor fixes. This isn't nearly as disastrous as the ReallyBad Edition of DWJ's _The Ogre Downstairs_, but I wasdisappointed to find alterations in what is a marvellous story."
3,Enjoyable Fantasy Novel,"This is an entertaining book from the prolific Diana Wynne Jones. Set in her multiverse universe, a set of parallel worlds with varying predominance of magic and/or science. This universe is influenced by Magids, powerful magicians charged with the task of acting as benign guardians of different worlds. This novel concerns a succesion crisis on one set of worlds, the search for a replacement Magid on Earth, and a set of complex shennigans at a Science Fiction Conference on Earth. This is an entertaining and generally humorous novel. This is not, however, the strongest of Wynne Jones' books. Readers expecting something as good as The Spellcoats or Dogsbody will be somewhat disappointed."
5,A++,One of the best books ive read in a long time. Its does start off slow but it get good so keep reading
4,engineering novel about the joys of work,"First, this book is not about Nazi. Second, this author is not an artist( he's more and less than that).This writer is not the straightforward creator who sits in his living-room thinking about life and all; he started to write inspired by pain and suffering. That means his works are always a struggle to grasp the poet and entertaining side of art, while being unable to reach it.This novel is awesome. It says work is one's life and happiness. All this through the eyes of a travelling chemist admiring a manual and intellectual worker. It should please every one who needs to have a different and more constructive, while human, view of work. I strongly suggest you to buy it. Then send me your opinion."
3,"Like the stuff, but you use A LOT","We like these Masada salts until we tried the EO bath salts, which are a much better value. Relative to foo foo products from the specialty store, these are great, and we do like the scent/feel, but you need to use a whole cup of this stuff. Worth a try, but I suggest trying the EO salts too."
1,not what I thought it was going to be,"I use bath salts everyday. I assumed that these large sized containers would last me at least 6 months. I was wrong. These salts are not solid granuals, but a puffed rice version of mineral salts. I usually use 1 - 2 tablespoons of other brands. This brand called for 1 - 2 cups. These large containers held less uses than any other brand I had used."
4,A Fairly Good CD...,"Most articles are on either end of the gade: either 5 or 1, but mine is a 4, and here's why:the one thing that gets very distracting is the fact that you are completely aware that it ISN'T live. laughter and applause come in completely inappropriate places, and the jokes in between are usually only funny to the people that wrote them.secondly, while some people are glad that stewie finally swears, i think it cheapens the CD completely. if you've ever heard the DVD commentary for volumes 1 or 2, you know what i'm talking about. seth has almost no restrictions on what he can say, and he abuses the power.the songs, however, are imaginative and funny, and it is a fairly wothwhile purchase, but I would suggest sampling the songs first."
4,Sturdier than expected,Compact....doesn't take up a lot of room yet holds 23 bottles. It's a clean and neat look for an open room.
4,Wine Rack,Surprisingly sturdy but be sure you load wine from the bottom up. Holds 27 bottles while using limited space and will fit most decors
4,pick up urban dance floor gorillas,read the title this is just another old cd with the same songs but a new title.
3,Cute ring.,"The ring was cute. They dont turn the ring around to show you that the design does not go all the way around. Seller was pretty prompt with shipping it. Though I do not suggest buying from them as a gift for someone. Their sizing is off, so make sure you check it when you get it. (I ordered a size 9 and got a size 8)"
4,"... this book in half,....","...(First half of book) fiction with only brief mentions of Lovecraft's creation, the Necronmicon. BUT, the second half of the book consists of two great ficticious versions of the ""Blasphemous Tome"", th ""Dee Translation"" and the more acaicly-written ""Sussex Manuscript"", there's a ""preface"" by DeCamp, a biography of the Mad Arab, Lovecraft's brief essay on the Necronomicon's history, a critical commentary, and a short ""lost chapter"" about what really drove Al Hazred mad, even a drawing based on woodcut of Al Hazred himself! Even throwing the first part of the book away, it's well worth the money. I highly reccommend it for all ... Necronomicon fans!"
3,"Good value, very slow shipping","Although this textbook was at a great price, it came about a week later than I needed it, which is not good for a student starting classes. It would have been a better experience if the shipping was better."
5,Lots of fun,"I was intrigued by the premise but did not know what to expect when I put this on. The film follows ""Meatball"" through his life of building, racing, and enjoying classic british motorcycles, mainly Triumphs. The soundtrack was great and the movie is just an all around feel good time. I put it on every once in a while and it's always fun to watch. If you can't have as much fun as these guys at least you can enjoy watching them have fun. 5 stars."
4,Unexplained...,"Read a Washington Post review and decided to pick up this CD. It was a good find. An incredible voice.Songs like FOR REASONS UNEXPLAINED, CONTAGIOUS, BLOOD, and BLOOM stand out as the highlights to my ear.Otherwise, I wish Casey's voice had been pushed more to the front as in these four songs. Many of the other songs could easily be Tori Amos or Sarah McClachlan. No exact signature or distinguishing characteristics. Makes for nice background music, but not much to get passionately worked up about.A few years back (and apparently still out there somewhere) was a singer named Ke (album - I AM). Casey should take a page or two from this singer's book and follow the vein that flows in BLOOD.All around, a very good album."
1,I DON'T LIKE THIS CHAIR.IT'S TO FAR FROM THE TABLE AND FOOD,"FALLS ON THE FLOOR,BABY DOES NOT SIT UP CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE TABLE.WASTE OF MONEY,DO NOT BUY."
3,"We like it, but hard to clean and food falls on floor",We love the fact that you can have the babies (twin 9 month olds) in the chair at the table. The girls love it--BUT--Cleaning is very challenging and the girls have a lot of food fall on the floor through the 1-2 inch gap between the seat and the table. We spread out a plastic mat--yet another thing to clean after meals. I'm washing it for the first time today and getting the cover off was a challenge. The Hippos get especially dirty with food particles and I have to really work at cleaning it. Chicco should make plastic covers that serve as trays over the hippos and cover the gap to the chair. Then this would be nearly perfect!
1,In The Name of Mercy,"Perhaps one of the worst books I have ever read. The charachters in this boring story are completely forgettable, so much so that you find that you have to page back in the story to remember who is who. It is an old and tired plot with the bizarre Dr. Kavorkian antics as a main story line."
4,It was better thaN I expected,This book was better than i expected! It diffinitely had some turns and twists that were unexpected! Be prepared for a Stephen king type ending. The characters were okay although I don't like to read about rich people that much!
5,Golgol,"This must be Russian satire, as satire was unheard of during this time. This man made this book amusing and made fun of the so called ""rich as determned"" by how many souls (serfs) they had. He bought up dead serfs and gained some popularity and status for a while.Usually 18th and 19 Century Russian literature is serious and did in a suttle way exposed the suppression of the Russian lower class people.Mr. Golgol approached the matter in a lighter way and some what morbid way. The book was great and have read it twice and have suggested it at our book club which we will discuss in December. Members not aquained with Russian literature and the title is a bit mis leading, turned an eye brow when they heard the title.Karl Olson"
3,Some Good! Some Not So Good! One Incorrect!,"My title suggests my interests in this type of music. There are a few songs here I remember hearing years ago and enjoyed. However, I can't stand yodeling and numbers 10 and 20 have it. A big disappointment to me was the last song, number 22. It is NOT ""Home on the Range"" by Gene Autry. It is Gene Autry singing a song I never heard of before called ""Tears on My Pillow Each Morning."""
1,rusty rusty knives,"the knives start rusting, looks like there is some contamination or something in the metal. Oh, they are made in China... could explain it... any kind of metal could be under there..."
5,Netanya Davrath lives on.,"Having listened to Netanya Davrath singing Songs of the Auverne for many years and hearing so many others trying but not succeeding in matching her quality and something else that is hard to describe. She seems to get right into the feeling of the music and the little inflections of her voice bring so much to her performance. This is why I ordered the collection of Russian, Yiddish and Israeli folk songs. I was not disappointed as she gives them the same wonderful feeling. I am so sorry she is no longer with us and I hope to find other of her performances."
5,Paul Hemphill's Best Work.,"Paul Hemphill, likely the South's finest writer, has in the past written about country music, NASCAR racing and minor -league baseball. Now he brings his considerable powers to high-school football. ""Nobody's Hero"" is as exciting and drama-packed as the end-of-the-season championship game between two arch rivals. But what truly sets Hemphill's work apart and above other sports-centered novels are the complex and very human relationships that form the backdrop for the big game."
3,Export/Import,"Sir,I will like to have a basic information on cheap international trade.[export/import]traning used/new books with their prices.Best Regard,Gideon"
1,Old Osiris getting older,"Sorry for those who thought that this book would be useful to understand the many facets of Osiris' personality in the Egyptian mythology. Although full of interesting (but doubtfully referenced) evidences on this god, the speculating and out-dated theories of Wallis Budge hamper the reader to get a fully up-dated overview of the Osirian mythology and its consequences for the Egyptian Thought and aftermath. For newcomers, this is a dangerous text and my recommendation is not to read it; for the scholars, this is nothing else than a mere ""bibliophile"" item. And the price! If you really want to own it, buy the Dover's edition, it costs less than 20 bucks!! A true dissapointment."
1,"I realize it was labeled ""budget,"" but really....","I have to agree with the other posters who found the quality lacking in this product. It does not seem to match the photo and does not even fit together. The holes for the little wire pegs that keep the two halves together are drilled too close together so that you cannot get both pegs in at the same time. Also, the mitral and tricuspid valves are not attached in any way and fall out when you open the heart. Very disappointed and will be returning."
5,part of growing up,"I think just about anyone who has taken a literature class has been ENCOURAGED...[required] to memorize this poem.And it's a darn good poem; tells a story that sounds, [especially to a younger person, very real].Robert Service has always been like...the 'other' Jack London. These two authors should be, [if not already], required reading in any English/Literature class taught.This particular poem was always a good one to have memorized--- in order to recite it around the campfire at a Boy Scout camping trip. Just seeing the title in print brings back fond memories."
4,A Great Little Book Of Wisdom,I found this little book to be laced full of wisdom; the kind of wisdom that I can apply to my every day life. Worth the purchase and one that I will refer to most often.
2,More for the childless than the childfree,"As someone who is intentionally childfree and has never experienced much ambivalence on the issue, I was disappointed that this book did not really speak to my experiences. I found myself becoming irritated every time Lisle stopped to reassure the reader that, in fact, she quite likes children. It was almost as if she was constantly apologizing for not having any of her own, and rather than ""challenging the stigma of childlessness,"" these apologies seemed almost to reinforce that stigma. I think it would have been a better (more meaningful, more significant) book if she had come to her decision not to have kids out of a position of conscious childfreedom, rather than ambivalent childlessness.While people who are childless, or who are contemplating not having children might find this book useful, I would not recommend it for those who know they are childfree."
2,This makes my brain hurt,"I am a highly educated woman, but the language of this book is very hard to grasp. It gives wonderful historical information and facts, which is what the 2 stars are for, but my brain had to translate at least 1 word in every 2 sentences, making reading slow and difficult."
2,Biased,"I agree with a lot of the other reviews here; this book is more geared towards the childless than the childfree. There is a huge difference. The term childless applies to anyone who wants a child and cannot have one. The term childfree applies to anyone (straight, gay, or bisexual) who plans not to raise or bear children for a variety of reasons.If you're looking for a childfree book, this isn't it."
4,Not what i expected,"These cards are good, but not what i expected i expected them to be clear with just plain card markings each one of these cards has a huge picture in the middle so the cards are barely clear there is only a small fraction of clarity"
5,Great cards for a child,"These clear plastic cards feel good in the hand, are slightly easier to shuffle than traditional cards and come in a nice case that snaps shut securely. A great stocking stuffer from Santa."
4,cards,just what i expected but they do stick together a bit and are kinda different in style. they work great ho and if youre looking for a set of camping cards that could get wet this is prob for you.
5,Cool!,"Clear playing cards are fun, however they do need to be roughed up a bit. Just like with regular playing cards you have to flex the cards a few times .. the clear ones it's kinda the same thing. I liked these because they have the classic Bicycle playing card design but they are also clear. I carry a deck in my purse. Never know when you're going to need playing cards! haha"
2,What a Mistake!,I was traveling on business and wanted some playing cards. I prefer Kem all plastic at home and saw these. They were sold alongside Bicycle's plastic coated cards.I didn't realize these were intended to be a toy. There was no way to see the cards as they were sealed. I found out soon enough when I opened them to play. I am used to slick cards so that's not the issue. The problem is that they are very hard to read. I suppose some people and children would be fascinated with the concept of see-through cards but it's a real hindrance to playing. For children's games it might be interesting; for the rest of us these aren't worth the trouble.
2,You can do much better,"The spray nozzle on this product seems to be its main problem. So much comes out at such high pressure that it splatters and doesn't apply evenly. If this weren't the case, perhaps it could be a good product. But I have purchased several spray tans over the past five years and this is one of the worst I've tried."
2,SO difficult to get through!,"I had high hopes for this book, as it received 5 stars from the other reviews. Even more so, the beginning was exciting and pulled me right in. However, by the time I was 1/3 of the way through the story, I was struggling to stay attached to the story. There is so much potential in this story, but it did the one thing that, as an avid reader, drove me insane: it didn't show me the story, it only told me the story. There were multiple opportunities for story development; instead, the author chose to race through with quick summaries and convoluted conversations to move the story faster than it needed to go. Definitely not one of her better works. I'd love to see a follow-up or remake of the story, and see it done well."
3,Dedication,"Decent movie with good intentions of being better than it was. Expected more from a talented cast like this, but felt it fell short."
3,"Yuppies in Rhyme, All of the Time","This book is written in poems and rhymesSupposedly about the times.It's all about yuppies in loveBeing happy under stars above.It's camp, it's kitsch, it's full of fadsThere's straights, and gays and bi's and dads,Pet iguanas, cats against nukesAll kinds of things we think are flukes.To tell the truth about all of itIt gets quite boring after a bit."
3,Leadbetter was good but Butch was better,"I'm a new to golf enthusiast who's constantly seeking advice and tips to make my game less awful than it currently is. I found the two Leadbetter discs informative but they were too technical for the novice - too much information was being directed at you to take it all in properly. For the novice, at least, they're better watched in short bursts rather than all at once.I did however find Butch Harmon's disc the best of the three. He was clear, easy to follow, and the disc was well broken up into stages. His instruction was clear and intelligible even to me. And it did help - at least for a while..."
2,GOLFERS PLATINUM COLLECTION,Very short dissertations on the basics of golf instruction. Not too good for the of a value for the average player.
3,Not sure of the effect,"I think I have experienced added fatigue as a result of taking this. I only take 500 mg (1 capsule) and did not want to take more, just in case it was truly making me tired."
5,Practical Help,"In DOGS & THEIR PEOPLE, Steve Diller offers practical advice that worked for me and my dog (a 4-yr-old bichon), including especially how to get her to walk on the leash without yanking my arm off. He also offers some tips I used for fine-tuning the training we had already done. Bottom line: ""Bobbie"" is a better-behaved dog since we tried the methods described this book."
1,"Philips, I am disappointed!","This stereo has been in a box since it broke almost a year ago. I have found Philips to be one of the worst electronics manufacteurs out there. Their products just don't last under normal use. Plus, they really do not stand behind their product. I am tired of making Amazon do all my leg work so I am just going to eat the costs on this one and let Philip's name get dragged through the mud. Shame on you Philips, shame on you!"
5,"Best introduction to Kabbalah,Cabalah, Qabalah I've read!","To be honest, I haven't read a lot of books on this subject but I WISH I had READ THIS ONE FIRST. The author is very silly in an Anton Wilson sort of way so if you want your learning dry and condescending then I caution this as a purchase. Though there is chicken in the title, this is no broth. It is the meat of the matter put forth in a very easy to understand and digestable manner. Highly recommend."
4,Kids Love It,"My kids all loved this one. My youngest played with this from about 15 months until 30 months or so and it accommodated her different stages. She loved putting all the little people in the spots, driving it all around, crashing it into things and especially all the noise. I personally hated the songs and the sounds but I will say my kids all loved it. It gets less play now but even my six year old likes to use it when he's playing cars and trucks so it is something that can grow with your kids. OH and the batteries seem to last a loooooong time so get used to the sounds mom and dad!"
5,Well Worth Adding to the Collection!,"This bus is definately a hit with my 27-month-old daughter! It is well made and rides freely on all types of flooring. The doors are easy to open and the stop sign adds a fun measure of interaction. The top of the bus is open which allows easy access to the seats inside.As always, the music is cheery and bright, but not too loud. My daughter now sings along to the songs, and I'm thankful that Little People picked ones that everyone remembers. ;)Maggie is by far her favorite character; I think she is more visually interesting than the others because of her glasses and red hair.Another hit from Little People!"
5,Very cute,"My 22 month old played with this toy a friends forever so i vowed if it kept his attention for that long, long enough for me to do dishes. Or some house work I was buying it for Christmas. So thankfully he does like it and it's educational with colors and stop sign, lights and music all that good stuff. Im glad we bought it."
4,My two year old loves this toy,"I got this for my two year old daughter 8 months ago, and she still plays with it almost daily. She just loves it.She lovesthe music too!"
4,Fun for toddlers,"Both of my girls, ages 2 and 4, enjoy playing with this bus. It comes with about four Little People and a wheelchair. The side door and back door open (for wheelchair access), the headlight/eyes move as the bus rolls, and the stop sign can be pulled out from the side of the bus. It plays two songs, beeps, and makes a ""voom voom"" sound.One thing I like about this bus is that it moves only by kid-power, not a motor or wind up, so it can't go too fast and bump into things. It tends to engage the kids in more quiet play, rather than some of the motorized toys that zoom around the house. Also the noises that it makes are not too loud.This toy has paid for itself in terms of the amount of use it gets. If I could only afford one Little People toy, I'd choose the Farm, but the bus is reasonably priced and the kids love it, so if you can afford it, get it!"
5,Fun for all ages,"I have a 9 month old and a 4 year old - they both love to play with this little bus. Among the four different sounds played are Wheels on the Bus, If you're happy, and two phrases that can teach the color red and the concept of round objects. I highly recommend any Little People toys for kids of all ages!"
1,Microsoft Train Simulator,"Great concept - wonderful game - but.... the game crashes everytime you play and takes forever to download - so where are the brilliant IT guys that created it. And guess what, when you call for assistance, they have absolutely no concept of how to fix the problem. This game has so much potential too bad it doesn't work. How about recreating the game ... and, oh, let's see, can you make it work this time, so it doesn't crash your system."
4,cool,cool game for a simulator still play it. needs to be more open TO LET YOU GO CROSS COUNRTY. neede to add people getting in and out
3,help I think I got gypped,"All you flight simmers, stick to FS. I guess TS is all right for a first try by microsoft, but really, even enron could come up with something better. The selection of trains and tracks barely cuts it, and even though the graphics are nice, the view options stink. For instance, in passenger view you cannot look behind you period. In cab view, you can only look directly ahead and to the sides. No back view either. About the only thing that is slightly exciting is the derailments. Hit a piling at 200 mph and watch your train be pasted all over the map. And all this junk for 2.7 gigs! If, however, you choose to ignore sage advice, like I did, get this game as cheaply as possible."
1,waste of time,don't waste your time this game doesn't work it use to be a good game when it was distributed by Microsoft no its just a pirated flop
4,All aboard this modeled and detailed sim,"Well Microsoft brings out another simulator, on involving planes, and now one involving trains!!! This sim has 11 trains with many miles of track. From the Marinas Pass in Montana, to the Acela Express in the east, this game sure has featured trains from the past and from the present. My favorite is the Acela Express because of its unique design and the ability to go 125mph!!! There are challenges as well, good activity in the game.There are always cons to even the best of games, first is the lack of a printed manual, why cant microsoft afford to print manuals anymore, were paying lots of money to buy these games and no manuals. Except ones on the cd. Also it feels like your the only human out there, no people and no AI trains passing you by, you are the only one out there.If microsoft would pay attention to these cons, this game could have been 5 stars, but in school terms, its a B+"
4,Great but difficult,This is a really neat train driving game but not for the young. My son is only 7 and this being rated for everyone I thought it would be perfect but it VERY HARD. You have to copy out the manual then try to read and drive. I think its really cute but will require an adult to assit them. It takes several buttons to drive it and several to control it. I was thinking it would just be go and stop but this is more real. All in all very interesting and real feeling but requires the advise of an adult to help. I copied the 90 page manual then put it in plastic sleeves so my son can flip through it. You will need to copy this manual because all the trains drive different and you can't stop the game to keep going back to the manual all the time. I think it's a good buy but be willing to spend some time to learn the tricks of the trade. The train simulator book is useful also and you can buy it right here at Amazon.
2,A fast machine...,"No, not the locomotives in Train Simulator, it's your computer that will need to be FAST. Our fairly new 2.2 Ghz P4 with Geforce 4 card still stutters in some views. Forget the stated system requirements.If your system is up to the task, the trains are good looking and so is the scenery, but that's all this game is, operating trains. Sounds facinating, and it really is in a way, but it does grow boring fairly soon.Just imagine driving an 18 wheeler for the first time. Up through the gears, perched way over traffic. Cool experince, and then you just drive and drive and drive. Much like running a train. ""Wow cool"" quickly becomes ""just a job"".If you already like flying simulated airplanes for hours on end and trains appeal to you, you may be glad you bought it. Otherwise, I say it's best to leave this train at the station."
1,Video Cards,This program did not work with my video card. Buyers are well advised to check the Microsoft site to see if the program will work with their video card. There are a number of them that it won't work with. I couldn't even get the patch to work.
3,May Cause Drowsiness Behind The Wheel,"The quality of the graphics of MSTS is quite impressive. The train's are highly detailed and move very smoothly.The gameplay is repetitive and boring after a while. There are times when there is nothing to do but to watch the repetitive scenery go by. Granted, I have not tried the Activities included in the game, but I'm not expecting much.The biggest surprise turned out to be a technical one: The game disk is not needed to run the game, which is very unusual, especially when all other Microsoft games I've used required that the disk to be in the computer."
4,If you like Trains,If you like trains this is a must have. A few small bugs in the program but sure microsoft will come out with a patch. I give microsoft a A on this one.
3,What the hell?,"I have no idea if this game is good or bad, but I was honestly confused when I saw the title of this game. Maybe Microsoft can spend more time on fixing buggy operating systems and less time on random train simulators."
2,Knot for Fishermen!,"Geoffrey Budworth is not a fisherman, he is a knot book publisher/historian/marketeer. His books on rope knots are excellent but skip this title if you are looking for a go-to fishing knot reference. Two superior fishing knot books are Marty Sosin's Practical Fishing Knots and Geoff Wilson's Complete Book of Fishing Knots and Rigs. However, if you want a good book on rope knots, any of Mr. Budworth's many titles are sure to please."
3,"A safe, conventional interpretaion with dated sound","Josef Krips ranks alongside the likes of Karajan, Bohm and Fricsay in terms of stature. This set is very much in the german big band orshestral tradition. The LSO play very well but are not quite in the same class as the Vienna Philharmonic or the Berlin Philharmonic. The recording carries quite a bit of hiss but the ear adjusts soon enough. The best performances in this set are the 5th, 7th and 9th symphonies."
2,lame Leia - stay away collectors,"I just got the leia boushh and it's pretty darn lame. Glad I have the original 12"" boushh Hasbro made a number of years ago. The light up han in carbonite is laughable. If it was a cheaper price I might not be so harsh...maybe 10 bucks. :P Hasbro couldn't even do a good rehash.The han in carbonite is just a flat shell. they couldn't even make a sublte 3d outline for han like the original 12"" han in carbonate. when u have it on display just looks like just a black block. and when it does light it shuts off after a few seconds. when it is lit, the four led lights clearly show through which cheapens the effect. As for the leia figure, she has this goofy happy look on her face. if it had a voice chip i'm sure it would say ""i'm so happy to be a bounty hunter, weeeee"". She looks like a barbie doll. oy vey. A real disappoint as a collector's item."
5,Bird and fat Girl together!,"It's the one and only time you find Bird and Fats together.The tempo on Little Willie Leaps is beyond, simply beyond bright.If the audio quality was just a little better this would be considered among themost important recordings in the history of mankind."
1,"Crooked, gets stuck, song lasts 20 seconds","I bought this adorable mobile in hopes that my 3 month old would enjoy watching it move about and listen to the music. The crank is so loud, and the music lasts around 20-30 seconds. You have to stand next to the mobile and the crib and escort Pooh around the arm of the mobile - it's horribly designed. Pooh's too big to make it past the arm so the mobile goes 3/4 turn and gets stuck. If you want to stand at your crib and keep turning a mobile; you'll already be close to re-wind the music as well. BUT if you want to be able to start a mobile and LEAVE the room, don't buy this one. Cheap and plasticky...the only positive thing about it is the adorable characters on it."
1,"Pretty pictures, but not much information","This book has some beautiful pictures to inspire you to visit Ireland (something that Lonely Planet, e.g., lacks), but has little else to recommend it. The information on where you should stop consists of about 5 sentences; not enough to help you decide if you want to stop or to assist you once you are there. We were in Ireland for 10 days; during that time, we found this guide useful for about 5 minutes, when we were trying to find Cliffs of Moher. Not a very good investment. For beautiful pictures at no cost, search the internet instead.The two guide books I would recommend are Lonely Planet and the Blue Guide. (...) Finally, make sure you get a good map once in Ireland, if not before.e"
2,Not Really Necessary,"I found this book not very helpful. It has more or less unrelated circle tours, but this is not how most people would tour Ireland. Most of the information is readily available in other ways, such as Frommer's Ireland 2006, which is much more comprehensive."
5,Gripping and intensely heart wrenching!,I could not put this book down! My heart broke over and over for Jennings and I found myself loving this sweet little boy! This is a must read if you like autobiographies...
3,Good Book,"This was a good book and it touched my heart. However, I was looking forward to finishing it only b/c it started to get a little boring. They writer did talk about child abuse but not so indepth that it was hard to read. If you don't like to read stories with such graphic abuse this is a good book to read. If you are looking for something that is a little deeper you may find this book a little boring."
4,Well written,"I read this book several years ago. It was riveting and very sad. I sometimes questioned if everything was true, however. After working with severely abused and neglected children for fifteen years, the book sometimes seemed a little too pat (almost like a stereotype of a horrible childhood). For other books on abused children I would highly recommend Torey Hayden's books."
5,Helped Someone I Know,"The author visited my friend's middle school several years ago to speak about child abuse. My friend's eyes opened and she realized her father abused her in almost every way. Her mom was no help; she was terrified of the abuser too.Eventually my friend set off on the road to healing, thanks to this book's author."
5,Great book,This is my favorite book. I have read this book over the years no less than eight times......that is why I had to get a new one :-)I highly recommend this book especially if you are like me and only like to read non-fiction.
5,A must read,Beautiful and heart-wrenching. This book will touch your heart and leave you wondering at the power of both neglect and the redemption of love.
2,Very very thin material....,"Sheets and comforter are cute, my son loves them, but they are paper thin. You can see right through the sheets, and they are a little rough. So far my son hasn't complained, but I do not expect the sheets to last too long."
2,Hey kids want to be comfortable too!!,"Bought this for my little Nephew. He was crazy over this but I would have preferred a much better quality. The Star wars bedding is a very very hard to find item so this was going to have to do. It is not very soft, looks better than it feels. I would not recommend."
3,Looks nice/poor quality,"The colors in the comforter and sheet set are very nice. I didn't expect it to be such poor quality. When I ordered it, I did not see the thread count anywhere. I don't think it will make it in the wash."
2,disappointing,No where in the description did it say it was a printed version of photocopied material. Many of the pages are barely legible and in some cases not legible at all. There are pages that are half there. I sent back the first book I received thinking that it was a misprinted copy. On receiving the second copy the same as the first I kept it because I wanted the subject matter.
3,A mix bag.,"Alright, the simplest explanation about this item is that it does give practical advice; however, most of it pertains to life some 50 years ago. Before the invention of contemporary cleaning products, devices, &c.;However I still find it an interesting read because it is a subject of great interest to me and I did learn quite a bit from it.Buy it on the cheap and read the portions of it that is to your liking and the rest at your leisure."
3,"Works well, but poor quality","I was excited to get the bag just in time for our first plane trip with our daughter. The bag does fit an infant car seat and it was easy to wheel.On the flight out I put the shoulder straps in the outside pocket (as suggested by the product description) and they were lost. On the way home the bottom of the bag got 5 puncture holes. We complained to the airline, but they say it is normal wear and tear. If normal wear and tear is 5 holes in one flight the product is poor quality."
4,Great Idea,"We loved this thing. We took with us on our trip last month (we checked it) and it was fabulous. I'm kind of bummed over the rips, but thanks to the previous reviewers, it was expected. I will definitely used the duct tape recommendation. Loved the fact I could carry it on my back while pushing the stroller. I was a bit hesitant over the weight of the carseat because I have a bad back, but this product relieves all the stress. My baby seems heavier!Completely perplexed over the person who thought they can roll it down the airplane aisle. That's a no-brainer. Those aisles are unbelievably skinny, of course you would have to carry it."
3,"Product OK, great Customer Satisfaction from Company","This item had 2 tears near the wheels after the first airline trip where the item was gate checked (dropped off at the end of the jetway, right before boarding the plane). HOWEVER, the company sent a replacement at NO COST with no questions asked. Great customer satisfaction, but the product could be improved."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Quality","We were really looking forward to using this on our first trip with our baby. It worked great at the beginning of the trip, wheeled wonderfully through the airport and down the aisle of the plane but after just one use, started to rip all along the bottom, which in turn damaged our brand new car seat. What this bag needs is a heavy duty plastic guard on the bottom so that it won't tear if it rubs the ground. I am only giving this item 2 stars because I think it is poor quality for the price, which is quite steep considering it barely made it through a single use! I would be willing to pay $50 for a better quality bag. If redesigned with a rubber guard, I would give this item 5 stars."
1,This bag fall apart!,"I was excited to finally find this product, as I had been looking for a carrier to assist me in traveling by plane with my 11 month old's car seat. The main feature that appealed to me were the wheels, so that I could pull the car seat through the airport.Unfortunately, during the first leg of my trip, the zipper broke. The teeth of the zipper appeared to be broken where they rubbed against the ground either while rolling or by the conveyor belt at the airlines. Then, when I picked the bag up after my return flight, I found that there were holes torn in the sides of the bag. I was shocked that the fabric seemed to tear easily, as the car seat inside it was not large or sharp-cornered. I was extremely disappointed with the performance of this product. I had been hoping to get years of use out of it. Instead, it is trash after it's first use!"
4,It could be perfect....,"...if it had a double zipper to give you room to fit the car seat inside the bag properly so that way it wouldn't drag and create holes in the bottom of it. I own the Britax Blvd and it was like WWIII trying to get the car seat in the bag due to the single zipper. Since I could not get the wheels under the base of the Britax properly, when I pulled the car seat bag sometimes the bottom would drag and it create holes. This bag did last me 4 round trip flights before I had to throw it away. I would buy it again if it had a double zipper, as it was a nice bag for the price and once the car seat was in the bag there was plenty of room for coats. If you have a smaller car seat, you shouldn't have any problems using this bag, it was good quality."
2,Strap broke immediately,"One of the straps broke immediately as we tested the item with the car seat in it. We took it on our trip anyway since we didn't have time to return it. Other than the strap issue, it performed well -- this thing is really useful. (We took the suggestion and duct-taped the bottom, so we didn't have any failures in the fabric.) If so many other purchasers hadn't complained about quality, I would say our situation was a fluke. Anyway, if you decide to purchase this item, definitely get it a few weeks before your trip and try it out."
3,Lipton Ginger Twist,"Started drinking tea and thought I would give this Ginger Twist a try and did the Subscribe & Save. I'm not a huge fan of the taste of this, but others seem to enjoy it very well. It is definitely worth buying if you know you like Ginger Twist (I would recommend buying from the store first in a small pack before buying in bulk just in case). Overall the product is a good value."
5,Entertaining and Informative,"Liked the DVD a lot. Enjoyed seeing Dan and hearing his opinions and anecdotes. Even if you're a ""non-believer"", you can definitely enjoy this. Leaves you thinking after you see it....."
2,problems with sound editing,The sound editing is very unprofessional on this CD. The background music and sound effects often drown out the voices of those being interviewed. How could this be overlooked before release? The UFO clips are repeated too often and I was disapointed with the meager amount of content.All this adds up to spoiling the credibility of the subject and Mr. Aykroyd's message.
4,Not up to expectations,"I purchased this after hearing Dan Akroyd on Coast to Coast AM and viewed him as knowledgeable on the subject matter. He was fine on the topics discussed but I was led to believe there was new UFO video footage of great quality. While some of the video footage was newer, I would still not rate the quality as superior. We are left with the same age-old pro & con arguments with really no better photographic evidence than has been presented over the last 60 years. Overall, a good effort but a little below expectations."
1,no credibility,Neither Dan Akroyd nor David Sereda have any scientific training or background. This is pure pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. This is the type of material that continues to keep the topic and phenomenon of unidentified flying objects from study by real scientists.
3,Unfortunate waste of paper,"I'm a huge Greg Iles fan. After reading the back cover I thought this book would be as good as the rest. It was well written, but the plot was absurd. If you like realistic thrillers this is not the book for you. Try a different title, as Mr. Iles is a great storyteller."
1,A former Greg Iles fan,"I could hardly wait to get started with another book by Greg Iles as the past ones had been so enjoyable, but was I mistaken. I don't enjoy Iles' move to the supernatural....leave that to Stephen King. Before reading any more of his books, I'll wait for the reviews and shy away from such an unrealistic plot. I'ld love another ""Quiet Game."""
4,Natchez Revisited,"Greg Iles is one of the few authors whose books I always enjoy. Regardless of the premise of the story, Iles has the ability to get you engrossed in the characters and events.In his latest, Sleep No More, we revisit the site of my favorite Iles book, The Quiet Game. There are some familiar characters here from that earlier story, which is a welcome touch. How many times haven't we all wished authors would resurrect characters from previous books we've enjoyed?This book is as exciting as suspense thrillers get, and I promise you won't figure out the ending. And that is the best possible endorsement."
3,Waited for something that didn't happen.,"Listened to the audio version of this book. Having read many of Iles' books, I was waiting for a plausible explanation or scenario at the end. That didn't happen. I like Iles' character development in all of the books that I have listened to so far, including this one. About the only thing that I got out of it is the message that when one cheats on his/her spouse, the third party will stay with them until the end. Thankfully, Iles hasn't gone back to science fiction since this work!"
2,Irritating and disappointing,"I am a huge fan of the author, and was happy to discover one of his works I had missed. The plot is odd, to say the least. I thought I had accidentally picked up a book by an cheap imitator of Mr. Iles....but no. It looks like Mr. Iles was testing the Stephen King waters with this one. Sorry, sir....stick to what you know.I kept plowing along, however....waiting for the novel to finish with a great twist that would bring it back to earth and sense. Alas, it was not to be. I threw it in the trash where it belongs. I am still irritated that I gave it so much time.The main character in the novel is a spirit that jumps from body to body at the moment of sexual ecstasy. Let us hope that the plotline of this book does not jump from novel to novel at the point of terminal boredom."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"I've read several other Iles' books and liked them OK. This one stunk. Period. Not a fan of supernatural stories and kept hoping that the story would return to something believable, but it never did; in fact, it got more and more farfetched. Absolutely awful book. I may never read another Greg Iles book after this stinker.If I could give zero stars to this review, I would."
1,Absurd,"I am big Iles fan and I really enjoyed some of his other books, especially Blood Memory and the Quiet Game, but the premise of this one is so absurd that it makes any tension in the book fail, and although I cared about the characters, I failed to find any of them believable because of this whole soul switching business."
2,A Different Genre Than Earlier Works,"""Sleep No More"" was disappointing and dissatisfying when compared to ""Mortal Fear"", ""Black Cross"", ""Spandau Phoenix"" and ""The Quiet Game"". The cover endorsement by Stephen King should have been enough indication, but I didn't take heed. I have no objection to the premise of the book, and didn't find ""Sleep No More"" disturbing or even mildly unsettling. Worse, I found the plot tedious and the characters not the intelligent residents of Mr. Iles' previous writings cited above. I could put ""Sleep No More"" down and wait days to read more, and that was very disappointing because I stayed up until 2:00 a.m. reading his earlier books. Don't expect the same style, concise story-telling, crisp plot and language, or characters of Greg Iles' earlier stories. If you like basic horror/fantasy, you might enjoy ""Sleep No More."""
2,The supernatural was a turn-off,I am a Greg Isles fan. I've read 5 of his other books and loved them. I was unprepared for the supernatural/science fiction element to this book. Good characters. I really like his writing style but the premise of this book was just too far-fetched and quite raunchy.
2,Sleep No More,"As I was reading it I gave it a 5 star reveiw. I could not put it down. The ending I felt, robbed me, it was the biggest anti climax I have every had. I think the author thought of the plot but couldn'y explain it away without resorting to fanatasy/science fiction. I wanted to read a thriller, that was plausable, this just wasn't for me. Unless you are in to fantasy/science fiction and all things that can not be explained forget this book. I was desperate to get to the end where I thought all would become clear. This did not happen. When I got to the end of the book I slammed the book shut and swore."
3,Don't bother,This did not feel like a Greg Isles book to me. He is such a good writer and this book was so far below his usual standards. Stupid.
2,Cabinet Latches,"Latches were very affordable, however, some have broken after installation, or become damaged closing doors. Others seem to fail when door is opened, while others work fine."
2,So - So,Its foam safe that's why I bought it -- hiding power is poor and it takes forever to dry. But the price is right as compared to other foam safe coatings.
2,and other issues,"I was disappointed by this book. I thought the book would be about BIG, but the book focused on people who really didn't have anything to do with him. The book doesn't focus on Christopher Wallace, instead it tells more about Tupac, Orlando Anderson, and other unimportant people. A lot of things are mentioned six times in the book. There are few new details. What I would have liked was more about his childhood, as Voletta Wallace is a source that shouldn't have been a problem. What exactly happened that night? Some people are keeping their mouth shut and that is a real shame. BIG is still the greatest, he should have gotten more respect than this, not only from Cathy Scott, but also from his ""friends""!"
3,for kids,I picked this up at a used bookstore just because of the author. I think it must be for young adults. The writing was simplistic. I think the typeface was even larger than most books
5,fun for adults too!,"My 2 year old son got this as a christmas gift and we all loved it! We had to break up several fist fights between people that wanted to play with it, not all children either. The one complaint is that it is hard to find tapes now, with the exception of Amazon. But I guess that isn't the tape players fault. Other than that it is too much fun."
1,Tape Eater,This toy was purchased for our three-year-old grandson for Christmas. He absolutely loves music and we were looking forward to him being able to control his own music. We bought CDs and taped them for him.What a big disappointment. This so called tape player ate three tapes in a row.I'd think twice before purchasing this toy.
4,Great toy for a 3 year old.,"We are sending this to our 3 year old grandson in Korea for his birthday. We are recording grandma, grandpa and auntie reading books to him so he won't forget our voices. The recorder is colorful and bright just like 3 year olds like. It seems tough enough to stand up to an active boy. It was easy for us to record on, so should be a breeze for a 3 year old to use. The fun sounds you can make like an alien or chipmunk, etc were great."
1,Way Too Much Feedback,"I read the other reviews and decided to buy this toy for my three and a half year-old daughter for Christmas. What a disappointment! There was so much feedback it was impossible to use. It squealed loudly no matter how we held the microphone. This is also a very heavy toy. I bought a similar recorder (...) at the drugstore...though not as durable, we use it all the time with no squealing problems."
2,Disappointing,"As a Stearman flying Texan, I thought this book would be good, but it has too much personal stuff and not enough flying."
3,Decent ball for decent price...,"It is a little bit on the smaller side, and you really had to throw it hard for it to spin properly. Good for kids who are truly interested in learning how to throw a football properly."
1,Lasted 48 hours,The fins started to rip within 48 hours after first getting the Aerobee Rocket Football. Hard to throw spirals since fins interfee with the throwing motion (fins hit hand upon release). Looks cool. Great idea. Poorly implemented.
2,Weak scent,Soap leaves you feeling clean but scent is very weak. I'm still looking for a great smelling soap. Just brought Creed Irish Tweed and is looking forward to using it!
2,OK for beginners,"I bought this book because of the lack of material on java.nio.The book is a good introduction to java.nio but that is the extent of it. Half the book is an api reference and regular expressions (why is this even covered in this book?).The rest tells you a little bit about the API, but not how to use it. There are examples, but you have to download them from the internet (ie no CD with the book).The best chapter you can download for free anyway, so don't bother buying the book. Just download the free chapter and the free examples. The material on the internet from this book covers 90% of what you need to know."
3,"Good introduction to NIO (and regular exprs??), lacks depth","The book is useful to get started on nio, but you may overgrow it after a week:it does not delve deeply into the matter. Particularly missing are:- Mapped byte buffer uses- Interactions between java & else using mapped files- OS/platform idiosyncrasies (limits etc)- Performance analysisFinally, be aware that half of the book is devoted to regular expressions. The conflagration of nio and regexps is rather strange. I would rather have a shorter book with just a little more depth."
4,Pretty good overview but consider using a framework.,"This is a pretty good overview, particularly for those who have no previous experience with non-blocking IO. The author explains the concept of buffers very well, with useful diagrams illustrating the differences between position, limit, etc.The material on selectors and readiness selection is also strong.The problem is, there are idiosyncracies to NIO that make it difficult to use effectively for large-scale, high-performance applications without some in-depth knowledge.If you're really looking to architect a substantial NIO server or client, read this book for the overview, but also be sure to take a look at the open source Netty framework by Trustin Lee, or Ember IO by Mike Spille to see good NIO implementations that you can use as a building block."
2,academic details not for beginners,"If you have never used the Java NIO classes, especially selectors, this book may not be for you. It's more a reference than a tutorial. If you enjoy spending days reading the fine print of automobile leasing contracts you might enjoy reading this book."
5,fit to play has everything,"I've been teaching for 34 years, a member in the USPTA for more than 10 years and Fit to Play Tennis: High Performance Training Tips covers a lot of ground. It is in my opinion the book that covers almost every part of the game and does it concisely and in clear understandable English. If you buy only one book to help you with strategy, tactics, stroke production, conditioning, the mental side, injury prevention and treatment, drills and a great deal more this is the book. It is the closest I have found to being the complete book on high performance tennis training. I can not recommend it high enough."
5,love this product it smells great,I love this product it makes you smell great without being to overbearing i can not wear alot of perfume's and this is gentle enough to wear everyday and not get a headache. plus when you first put it on it smells like baking cookies in the kitchen with your mom when i was little. please don't ever get rid of this scent
1,Coffee nightmare,"Worst coffee I have ever had. Total wast of money,definetly would not want if it was free.I have never been so disapointed in a coffee prurchase."
4,Nicely Readable Oral History,"This is a very good and quite readable oral history about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1940-1950's. That celebrated team won several pennants, integrated baseball with Jackie Robinson, and had many colorful and talented characters. Written in the 1980's, we hear from ex-Dodgers stars like Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, Ralph Branca, Pee Wee Reese, Leo Durocher, and even some fans. We see how this team played in quaint little Ebbets Field, mostly succeeding except for some heartbreaking losses in the World Series against the Yankees. But sadly, the real heartbreak came when greedy owner Walter O'Malley looked at declining attendance and fled to Los Angeles after 1957. This book should be of great interest to baseball aficionados, particularly those that remember their heroes in Ebbets Field. Readers should also enjoy THE BOYS OF SUMMER, a superb if melancholy account by Roger Kahn."
2,Lids Comes Off,"I bought this for my 12 mo old daughter, and I thought it would be a great educational toy. It would be, however, the lid with the shade sorter can be taken on and off very easily. My daughter will try to put a block in the bucket, but takes the lid off to do it. This toy won't teach her a thing. I wish I would have bought a similiar toy with a lid that she cannot remove herself."
3,Definitely NOT for infants,"The specific value of this toy, which is identifying shapes is not for 8 months old. Definitely not for babies upto 1 year."
4,A great surprise,"My husband brought these home for my son when he was six months old. I thought he was nuts as I knew there was no way my son would use the sorter top. I was right about that, but wrong to put the toy away. My son found it in the toy box and loved it right away! No - he cannot use the sorter top, which is why I only give it four stars since it is supposed to be for six months and up. However, he loves to take the blocks out, bang them together and put them back into the container. They are a wonderful size and the material they are made out of is great for chewing on. Also love the great colors. I think we will get many many months enjoyment out of this."
1,simply and remarkably AWFUL,"This is BY FAR, one of the most annoying cds I have ever listened to. It is pretty much an insult to jazz music and musicians and masters. Save your money and buy some other worthwhile music. I have an open mind for all jazz and this is just beyond description. I desperately tried to isolate one track that is bearable to listen to, but had very little luck! The Gainsbourg and Barney Wilen tracks are probably the only salvageable tracks. Too bad. This sounded like a project with possibility, but totally disappoints."
4,DaVinci Code Movie Music CD,This is the musical score from the movie The DaVinci Code. It is great score and has haunting melodies that go along with the action of the movie. If you like to listen to the musical scores this is one you should add to your collection.
1,Scoring Rubrics in the Classroom: Using Performance Criteria for Assessing and Improving Student Performance,The book was not what I expected. I thought I would be receiving a book chock full of child friendly rubrics. Instead it was more for high school teachers or college professors. Pretty much a waste of money.
5,Good,This thing really does fly forever. Easily thrown over 100 yards - make sure you've got plenty of room to use it or it'll end up in the trees
2,Didn't know what it took to change it.,I didn't realize the old battery pack was soldered onto the circuit board. I thought I could just take the dead batteries out and replace with the new ones.Instead I had to unsolder the terminal strips and then solder the replacement battery pack terminal strips in place.That fact should be noted in the description.BR
2,Battery Pack,When I finally received the shipment (which was 4 days late)Shaver Battery Pack fits most Norelco models & othersI was disapponted to find that the terminals were unmarked with a + or - sign. Since no instructions were included I had to guess how to install correctly so the poles matched up. I may have damaged the old razor in replacing the battery pack.
3,slower motor speed with these (soldered in),"I can't say for sure the longevity of these, but initially, the motor speed is slower, and it doesn't seem to like to be charged with the factory charger. It does work, it does recharge, but it isn't the same as the factory batteries. I do have solder experience, I did de-solder and install the new ones with the full process, and am not convinced I made the right choice."
3,Please,"Please, Jason D. Loughran, and others, there is NO way this card is only compatible with Intel CPUs. AMD may not have as big a market share as they might like, but Intel would never reduce its own market share by producing a wireless LAN that worked only on Intel machines. Only one company in the world is that STUPID (Apple, Inc??). I have three of these cards and it does work on AMD computers (all my computers are AMD and always will be)."
2,I NEED HELP,HELLO I HAVE A DV6110US HP PAVILION NOTEBOOK I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THIS CANT WORK PERFECT IN THIS NOTEBOOK WATH YOU RECOMENT TO ME TO DOI NEED A LOT OF HELP ...PLEASE LET ME KNOW SHORTLY
1,Vista Driver Problems,"I can see in some reviews that folks have had success with this card. However, I experienced all the poor signal/connection troubles that have been reported for this card. Even though Intel keeps updating the drivers for it you should search the internet regarding these issues before buying this card. I wasted far too much time with it. The aopen card I bought when I finally gave up and tossed the Intel worked from the first moment I turned it on."
2,Fiber Optics Devices and System,"This is an important topic and the book is nicely written. Unfortunately, it is hopelessly outdated. In particular, single mode fibers, which by now dominate the market, are still thought to be inferior to multimode fibers.It would be nice, if the author could bring the book up to data and expand it correspondingly. Without such and effort, it is nowadays of little use."
4,Important story/well told,"The story of the Abolition of the Slave trade in Great Britain is unfortunately not widely recognized. It has wonderful lessons about what can be accomplished by a group of organized passionate people. It was particularly interesting in the discussion of the tactics of these social activists in the Eighteenth Century. I did think the author did not do William Wilberforce justice in describing his lifelong efforts to reform England, motivated by his Christian faith."
2,More on the web,I bought all of the books in this series but was very disapointed. The photos are good but there is no more information than you can already find on the net.Sites like hotelliving.com and Tablet are free and have the same photos but much more information. Try them instead.
4,great from start to finish,"This is a great,great CD. It is not as impressive as 'Your Body Above Me', which is truly a masterpeice, but this is a great CD. Fantastic vocals and melodies, unforgettable. A great CD from a truly incredible band. Glad to see they are still around and putting out great music, anxious to hear their next effort."
1,I have seen better walkers for less!!!,"I bought this walker for my son's 9 month gift. Every month I will give him a gift, I thought that this walker was going to be great in price and being fisher price and all, I thought it was great. But in reality was very weak and too light, my son trying to hold on to it to walk almost fell on his face. ..."
1,Disappointed Mom,We received this as an early Christmas gift for our 10 month old daugher and it was immediately apparent that this toy is VERY UNSAFE even with constant supervision. The wheels roll too fast on anything but shag carpet and it is too light and flimsy to stay upright when in use. We have decided to throw it away before our baby really gets hurt. This product should be recalled.
3,NOT SAFE AS A WALKER,This is a nice toy if your child is already walking. This toy is extremely light weight & the wheels move way too fast. It's ok for more experienced toddlers but definately not for babies just learning to walk. My 11 month old who is just starting to take thoughs 1st steps tried to walk with it and it rolled away too quickly causing her to fall on her face. Apply the slightest bit of weight to it & it will tip over! Not a very good design
1,Beware!! Your child could get seriously hurt!!!,"My 10 month old son received this walker as a x-mas gift from my in-laws it is terrible. First of all this walker is too light and goes too fast that many a time it almost came out from under him. (If we weren't right there he would have fell on his face). MOST IMPORTANTLY, one night he was playing with the toy taken down (as an activity toy) and my husband was right there with him and all of a sudden he started to scream in pain-- (SINCE HE IS STARTING TO CLIMB- HIS FOOT GOT CAUGHT IN THE TOY AT THE BOTTOM WHERE YOU FLIP THE PLASTIC COLORED PIECES AND HE COULDN'T GET IT OUT!! HE WAS TWISTING HIS FOOT TO GET IT OUT- THANK GOODNESS MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO RELEASE HIS FOOT AND HE WAS OK- BUT I THOUGHT HE BROKE OR TWISTED HIS ANKLE AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT HIS FOOT IT WAS ALL RED.**** DO NOT BUY THIS TOY FOR YOUR CHILD**** IT WAS THE SCARIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE.... I JUST RETURNED THE TOY TO TOYS 'R' US AND THANKFULLY THEY TOOK IT BACK."
5,Love it,"I wanted to read the book again, this time to my family before we saw the movie as a family."
1,not a good idea,"I thought it would be comforting to see my baby when she was rear facing, however as I soon found out if you are ever rear-ended this becomes a very dangerous projectile, that is aimed right at the babies head. I found that several babies are injured like this every year. It just isn't worth it!!!"
1,Not happy,"I returned this mirror after I tried to use the remote while parked. It has to be pointed exactly at the right spot or it won't work. I could see myself getting into an accident while driving, so I brought it back. I now have a plain mirror that mounts the same way on the rear headrest, which is much safer for us all. Stick with the basics."
2,Didnt like it,"I didnt like this mirror. I am planning on returning it.First I am petit and there is no way I can place the mirror in a way where I can look at the baby and at the same time see the road behind. I have to get up a little bit from the seat and then pull back the car seat canopy, only to see a blurred image of my baby. Of course I can only do this when I am at a light and not driving, which becomes painfull when I am on the highway.Second, its cool you can set the mirror to music, lights, or both. Problem is you can not control this with the remote, so if you are tierd of the music, you'll have to switch it of! instead of putting on the lights on only....I will look the other ones.bea"
2,Waste of money,"The Sounds n' Lights Deluxe Auto Mirror by Fisher Price is a waste of money, in my opinion. I am able to see my son in the mirror but his face looks so small. The batteries in the mirror must be replaced at least 1-2 times/week in order to keep the sounds and lights coming!! My son does like to look at the bright colors surrounding the mirror (that would be my only positive feedback)."
1,NOT SAFE OR APPROVED BY CHP!,"I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,good idea but not worth the money,I bought this item for my newborn baby and I did not even get a chance to use it in the car. I took it out of the box and let him look at it while he sat in his boppy pillow and I agree with other reviewers he was content. The problem came when I tried to peal the plastic off the mirror. Once I finally got it off you could no longer see in the mirror because it was scratched so bad. The remote for it also did not work all the time and even when I tried to explore all the settings with out the remote the toy had a mind of it's own. It would not play correctly. I would say this toy was a waist of money and gave it one star because it is a neat idea. I wish another company would use this idea!!!
3,It could be better,"We just bought this mirror for our 6 mo old son. It could be better. (...) I'm not sure if we got a bad unit, but the remote control only works 1/3 of the time. The mirror also scratches pretty easy. Other than that it is an ok product. We do like b/c we can see our son while driving and he gets a kick out of watching 'the other baby'."
3,Good and bad,My 4 month old son always cries in the car so I got this mirror for a long car trip we were taking. The mirror is big and he definitely likes to look at himself. The lights and music are good too. It comes with a remote control that works great. I really enjoy being able to see him from the front. The only problem is installing it. No matter how many ways we try to attach it it's just not stable. It moves and won't stay where we want it. It's very annoying! If you can get past that then it's a good product.
2,Not a Wonderful Mirror,"I really love having a mirror in the back seat so that I can keep my son in view. I gave our first mirror to my parents after we bought this one and have regretted it ever since. I do like the shape of the mirror. I can see my son better than I could before. However I spent quite a bit of $$$ because of the lights and the music. Not worth it at all. There is only one song which just repeats itself over and over, driving everyone in the car crazy. The lights do not help you see the baby at all. The mirror also scratched a lot when I put the batteries in, so now I can't see my son after dark even with the interior car lights on. I was really disappointed with this mirror, but would suggest the basic version that Fisher Price offers."
2,OK,"The mirror is a great idea...in actuality it is not as great as it seems. The visor clip on the back of the remote is way to slim. Like others have said, it atkes a lot of batteries and drains them, when the mirror becomes smudged it is then pretty much useless and the mirror is very difficult to postion. I had purchased this mirror with my second son and now I do not use it I had to rummage for the Elmo mirror I used with my first son, I recommend that one its cheaper and simpler, spend the extra money on toys"
1,This is Dangerous,"I bought this for my grandson. We hadn't set it up in the car yet, thankfully. I had turned it on and was holding for the baby to look at. I turned it off and set it down next to me. I started smelling something strange, like melting plastic. I asked my son if he noticed the smell. He started looking around and he picked up the mirror and realized that the battery compartment was so hot the plastic was melting. He immediately romoved the batteries and I will be taking it back.I tried going to the fisher-price website to report this problem, but they don't have any way of doing that. But I did get an 800 number I plan to call."
4,"Nice Idea, would give as a toy","This is a nice toy, however it eats batteries. It is best when used for infants. Our baby liked it for about the first 3 months, but lost interest in the lights after that. she continued to like the mirror until she went into the convertable seat; now she can't see the mirror due to her angle. Would give this to a friend as a shower gift. Good quality and nice toy."
5,Very nice light,"I love this light, very easy to maneuver and get the light where you need it. No cords is a wonderful thing.I bought the B+D Firestorm 14.4 battery since it's a little cheaper and it works perfectly with this device."
4,Full English Version,"I saw this movie for the first time on Sci-Fi Channel's Ani-Monday. I was getting ready to call it a night when this was advertised as being next and had to stay up and watch it. It's a very well done movie with a lot of feeling of the first movie that was brought to the series. Alot of things have changed, alot of feelings are different, but it's all very good. I think I saw an edited version but for the most part it was very well done. All the original cast has returned to do the voices so there's no problem with the english subtitles or with dubbing. Overall it was a good movie."
3,Flimsy,Looks like the picture but the clock is hard to read. The plastic skull is very very flimsy. It was OK for the price.
4,"Silly, Fun and Gross A good time for horror / comedy fans","The Revenant has its flaws sure, what movie doesn't? BUT, it's flaws are literally dipped and smothered in horror, comedy and blatant gruesome fun. The acting is great, the story is engaging enough and the plot is pretty straight forward, never mind the giant bullet-sized holes. Without getting into spoilers here, if you enjoy movies like Phantasm, Re-Animator even Dawn of the dead, you can't go wrong here."
2,"Okay Start, Horrible Finish","I was intrigued by the blurb, I was in the mood for some comedy and strange. The movie started off okay, pacing was good, direction, cinematography, etc was fine and I liked the awkwardness of the film (film had a ""realness"" to it that most films like this just lack. You had a feeling of how the film was going to proceed and it was okay up until the first 60 minutes. Then the film just took a really dark turn that didn't quite match the tone of the first 60 minutes. And then they do something pretty bad with one of the likable characters and they basically burn the bond between the main character and us-- the viewer. So now, you are watching a movie for which you hate all the characters. And the only thing worse than the change in the movie and direction is the ending. Seriously, WTF?This movie could have been a solid B+ movie but it just completely botched the last 20 minutes of the film. Its like they didn't quite know how to end the movie..."
2,Revenant Not My Style Review,"I love all things related to the Zombie lore. I was a little disappointed with this movie. Parts where mildly amusing and funny, but overall I felt I wasted my money on this DVD. I felt the special effects just where not that good and the comedy got a little stale. Some of the things that went on with the main character where just too ridiculous for my taste. Maybe a fair rental but not worth the purchase price."
4,an inventive zomedy,"Bart awakes dead, post autopsy, and is quite freaked out about it so heads to his best mate Joey'sBart is clearly dead, but clearly alive with full brain function so is not your typical zombie, he also is completely dead during daylight hours only to reanimate at sunset, wich is conveniant enough for the boys to live a party lifestyle.While out one night they stumble into an armed robbery and bart is shot, realising being a zombie comes with the perk of being invinsible and seeing as Bart needs to drink blood to continue to servive decides to be a vigilante style superhero with Joey the happy side kick.Great to be watched in companion with Dead Heads, great laughs and a new perspective on the zombie landscape, a much needed reinvention"
5,a must have..,"Finally all the Passport albums from the '70s will be available, even though I paid good money for import vinyl and cd versions of ""Handmade"", I had to get this new issue. There are no bonus tracks or anything to make you jump on this, but it sounds fresh on the new pressings. This is when Curt Cress joined the band adding those powerful drum grooves and fills to the more complex arrangements.This is a more progressive album then previous,but still contains some real hard rock flourishes with fuzzy guitars. Not quite as realized as ""Lookin'Thru"" or ""Cross Collateral"", but you can hear them preparing for that next stage. This was always an import so some Passport fans might not have this one so jump on it. Also First and Second Passport worth checking out(see my reviews), also the two Doldinger's Jubilee albums will be released and I highly recommend those as well.."
5,Happy bird,My bird is eating Harrisons bird food for many years. It makes it easy to feed a parrot. My bird is healthy and loves the food.
3,As good as season 1 and 2 ...but,"this is the 3rd season, and after enjoying the previous seasons, itstruck me in this season that they might need some new personel to dosome of the voice overs. Im starting to hear the same character voicein many different sketches and its becomming anoying to a point...Anyway ...the show is original and hope to see season 4."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book, upon returning from a visit to Grenada, in preparation for my upcomming move to the island. I enjoyed the descriptions of the island itself but I could not overlook the obvious pretention and ethnocentric attitude of the author. I am a world traveler who prefers to visit countries with cultural differences - not to point out how inferior, or morally insufficient the people are, but to immerse myself in another world and step into someone elses shoes and life. Mrs. Howard's stories came across to me as whiny and self-serving."
5,Loved this book!,"Very well written and full of adventure. I felt as if I were part of the Howard family. The author has described so much beauty and culture that my wife and I plan to visit Grenada on our next vacation. This is a must read book if you like adventure, suspense, culture and to dream."
1,Big Bird too whiney,"I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to ""sic"" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this. Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act."
1,Sucks,"Don't bother with this trash. John Dean has been slandering a different person every five years by claiming they are Deep Throat. Dean is a total ass who has spun his association with Watergate over 30 years ago into an entire career. No one involved in that scandal has preened themselves before the public more than this guy. Now that we know that DT was Felt, what is Dean's response? To STILL insist that DT was merely a composite. Get over it Dean and go away!"
2,dated,"Not very good, there is so much good music out there, I doubt you will listen to this more than one or twice."
4,"Interesting film, not very well made.","I enjoyed the film. It's message and content where intriguing, but the actual execution of story was a little amateur."
1,Many errors found!,"I am a Spanish teacher and I was thinking of buying this book. After looking at one sample page, I would NOT buy this book! The single page I looked at is full of errors. The commands are incorrect. They also switch between formal and informal commands. Here are examples of errors and the correct forms in the informal:close the door--cerrada la puerta--should be cierra la puerta.cook this--coce este--should be cuece estedo this--hagas esto--should be haz estodo you need help?--tú necesitas ayude?--should be Necesitas tú ayuda?There are many more, and this is just one page of it. I would NOT recommend this book!"
1,Only good enough if you're desperate !,"This book contains a multitude of little errors and it jumps between the formal (usted) and informal (tu) forms without distiguishing between the two.It does the job ""more or less"" if you're in a pinch, but there has to be something better than this out there."
3,Memoir for all Ages,"This is the story of a young boy and his pet raccoon. Sterling North uses excellent sensory details, you get a very vivid picture of what he's describing. I loved this book, despite the fact that it was non-fiction. This is a heart-warming memoir fit for all ages."
4,great gift,I bought this as a gift for my son.It was shipped promptly to the correct adress.Many thanks
5,Track Listing and a Note,"Note: three of these songs are also on Golden Best One. I have no idea why the record label decided to do this.Nevertheless, you also get the classic ""Yawara,"" which was released around the time of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and which is about the competitive spirit, as well as ""Kanashizake,"" which is informed by a torrent of emotion and reminds of some of Billie Holiday's more melancholic outings and one of the best vocal performances by any singer ever, imho. Then there is the wistful reflection on human nature of the very catchy ""Ai Sansan."" ""Kawa no Nagare no Yo ni"" is especially sad because the title translates as ""Like the Flow of a River"" and it was the her last single before she floated off this mortal coil.1. Hanagasa Dochu2.

1,Couldn't Stand Up To The Dishwasher,"I suppose you get what you pay for. After a few months it cracked in the dishwasher. Granted, it's pretty cheap, but that was disappointing."
2,NOT Male to Female!,"While the product description states that the adapter is Male to Female, the one I received is in fact Male to Male. Now I need to buy an adapter for my adapter..."
3,"good game,very creepy and pretty hard",I enjoyed necronomicon.At times it was hard to hear the dialogue because the people either mumbled or talked to fast or soft.The graphics were good and the puzzles were not easy.The only thing i had to have help with was the correct urn.I just guessed any urn would due.I thought it was funny that in the town other than the fisherman nobody ever answered a door when i knocked.It is creepy like the 2 dracula games i played.Necronomicon is certainly harder than dracula -resurrection and a little bit harder than dracula-the last sanctuary.I thought the documents were complicated.If there is a negative to the game it is the overcomplicated documents.overall a good game.
2,Not even a Category 1,"In my 2010 Toyota Tundra it was a waste of money. Had hopes it would improve at least a mile or two per gallon, but it was more like two tenths of a mile. Spend your $20 on a few more gallons of gas."
2,its ok,"My strainer started rusting about 6 months after I bought it w/ little use. I am so sad because it is so pretty. Not very big but I could have lived w/ that. I cant live with a rusty bowl coming into contactw/ my food though. So into the trash it goes. If I had rated it when I first recieved it, I would have given 5 stars. Now only 2. I was expecting better quality than that."
1,"Great Camera, BUT!!!!","A great pocket camera, easy to use on and off my PC, at home, outdoors, in disco's. As my first digital camera it's been a pleasure to use.Sadly, batteries don't last long at all, are expensive to buy, and hard to find. A replacement battery over here costs 7UK, around ($) ?Regards"
3,"No summary or synopsis, only good for thorough detail.","Get the small pocket reference guide instead of this book! It is difficult to find what you want if you don't know exactly what you are looking for. I admit it covers the subject very well, but if you don't know Regular Expressions thoroughly, you have to read every word of the book or look forever to find what you want. Just buy the pocket reference guide and go to the library once a year when you need this thing."
2,Style way too distracted,"I think writing a book is a great personal accomplishment in itself. And I would give this book an ""average"" three stars, but for the writer's structuring. Way too much ""I am going to tell you something interesting later, and it's going to be really useful, but now let's just..."", which makes the book really very frustrating. Suggest the writer look at the Java intro by John Smiley for tips on how he might want to structure the next book. Obviously, the writer has a ton of knowledge, but where was the editor in all of this?"
5,this book changed my life,"not even kidding. you know how people say ""you have a problem, and you reach for a regular expression, now you have 2 problems?"" I will never respect anyone who says that, ever in my life.being puzzled by regular expressions *at all* is a problem you can solve just by reading the first half of this book.this should be required reading for all programmers, coders, hackers, geeks -- whatever word you want to use, if you're a person who comes into contact with regexes, you should recognize them for the easy and powerful tools that they are."
5,More than I required,It covers several languages. Very well done. I was looking for unix/linux regular expressions that go with sed awk etc.Bought that book also.
1,Never has so much been made of so little,"If you're looking for a handy desktop reference this book is NOT it. When faced with a short-fused development schedule and needing to get up to speed with regexps rather quickly I found the book to be difficult to navigate, inconcise, and the overuse of bold, italics, and foreign (Japanese?) characters and other oddities very annoying. I thought the book went way beyond regular expressions and therefore found it of little use as a reference guide. It is better suited as a tutorial for someone that has a lot of time on his/her hands. A much better reference, also from O'Reilly, can be found in ""JavaScript - The Definitive Reference"", by Danny Goodman."
4,Wordily book,The author talks so much of unrelated stuff outside regular expresions. However he gives good examples and cases for the use of regex.
2,pretty pedestirian stuff,"I am a photographer of ten years, and I was looking for a good liasion to the digital format from film. This book tries too hard to be everything to all levels, and it ends up getting in its own way most of the times. What pretends to be a good overview for beginners and pros, stadles the two and inevitably caters to the lowest common denominator.If you have any photography experience, understand how to expose a negative, etc. avoid this book. The pictures he uses are not that good or just plain cheesy. It makes me wonder how he got to this point."
1,Good for basic business editing,"I ordered this book hoping it would help me with proofreading textbooks. It didn't. This book is designed for business proofreading, which isn't exactly clear from Amazon's description. Probably a great book for those who know nothing about proofreading and will be proofreading in a corporate setting. Not for actual editors, publishers, etc."
2,Good while it lasted,"It took some computer savy to get setup, but once it was, the frame and idea are really nice. That is, until the Ceiva frame broke. No warning, just stopped showing pictures. Not much luck with customer service via e-mail so far. It is hard to rate a product very high when it is broken in 6 months. It also breaks your heart when you get your grandmother used to seeing grandkid pictures on a regular basis then it is gone with no reason."
4,These two have worked well,"I bought two of these last fall -- one for myself, and one for my parents. Both households have enjoyed the frames very much, with no problems. I find the web site to be good, and the quality of the display to be reasonable for the price.I agree with other reviewers that the subscription price is high. The 90-day warranty is silly. Dad recently had trouble getting his receiver to download new photos, and he had no trouble getting Customer Service on the phone, who told him they'd had trouble with his area code, and got him onto a 1-800 number temporarily."
4,Just in time,"I'm glad a friend intoduced me to the Ceiva digital picture frame just in time for Mother's Day. The price was reasonable, the screen quality is good and it couldn't be easier to use. There is a $...service fee per year. The best part is that once the frame is set up, my mom doesn't have to do a thing."
1,Worst Customer Service Imaginable,"Although the product is great, it is not worth the aggravation of dealing with Ceiva. Ceiva has the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. There is no phone number for Ceiva listed on their website and they are not in information. Emails to the company went unanswered for days. When I finally tracked down the phone number, I was put on hold for 27 minutes before an agent came on and told me the computers were down and I should call the following day. Since then, I have called three more times about the rebate and been put on hold for more than 20 minutes each time. It's been four months now and I have yet to see the $100 refund, despite several frustrating calls to the company. Again, the product itself is great - my grandmother loves it - but I would not buy another one until the company puts some support behind its products."
3,Neat product and concept - hoping for improvements,"This is a great concept, and the product is simple, elegant, and easy to use. I recommend it. However, would get more stars if there were some improvements: (1) Better screen - Would like higher resolution. Digital cameras have much higher resolution these days and the screens on these Ceivas need to catch up. Colors don't look right. (2) Better controls - Again colors are washed out. I'd like some contrast, brightness, and color adjustments. (3) International capability - I would love to send photos to relatives overseas using the Ceiva. Unfortunately the Ceiva system will not accept calls from overseas, even if the caller pays (seems like the product won't accept the number of digits required when calling from overseas). They need to fix this, since one of the primary uses is sharing memories and pictures with far away loved ones.Neat concept, needs some work."
2,"Great idea, but build quality falls short","Wow, what a great device... So simple you could give it to your grandmother.Well, thats exactly what I did 20 months ago. Now I'm sending back the second defective unit. Neither have any signs of physical abuse, but they just crap out. This is really disappointing because its such a great product, if only they could build it better. Two breakdowns (again - no drops etc) is just unacceptable. Maybe we'll be lucky and Cieva will license production of the frame so that someone with more manufacturing expertise can build a better device - hello Sony?"
3,"great idea, execution needs work","Great idea for grandparents with no computer to share photos. Resolution is fair, the biggest problem is lack of tech support. They outsourced the tech support function, and it takes them over 2 weeks to respond to email tech requests. I have a secret for you: call the company direct at 818-562-1495, tell them what your problem is, and they will try to fix it. Once you spend a couple of weeks working out the bugs, its a fun idea. The next models should have better resolution, and there are improvements pending in the very clunky web site."
1,"Concept is nice, website and customer service is crap","I have a frame that I bought for my Grandmother, but due to where she lives it was very difficult to get the frame to connect on a daily basis without resorting to toll calls. I have repeatedly tried to get them to stop renewing my account with out any success. My final solution was to call the credit card company and block any future charges."
5,A beautiful little book that touches your soul,"I read this as one of the three books Bl. Josemaria Escriva wrote using short spiritual counsels. Although these counsels are a little longer in this book, none go past two paragraphs. All are pithy in dispensing spiritual advice for every conceivable situation.Bl. Josemaria reaches to root of what troubles us spiritually, and challenges us to conform our life to God's plan for our life. He also teaches us that every little thing we do in our life -- work, sport, leisure -- can be done well for the greater glory of God, and offered as prayer.This presented an important spiritual awakening for me, since before reading this series of books I tended to compartmentalize my prayer life. No more. What makes this book unique is that it can be carried around with ease, and meditated upon during a spare minute or two during the day."
3,It was alright,"Okay, so far I've read about 5 or 6 Westmoreland books and I have to say that I'm not really feeling Storm like I was feeling the other brothers. Storm is good and all and he's fine but not like his brothers Dare and Chase. I like them much better. BJ didn't really go into too much detail about him being a bad boy as much. But overall, I still love BJ and I know we all have our not so good moments and this was a not so good but not so bad moment for her. Still love her though."
3,A Harsh Perspective of Elizabeth I,"Haigh has a good point about Elizabeth being concerned about her image, but is very harsh in portraying her as simply lucky in what success she has. He argues that she is very indecisive throughout her rule as evidenced particularly in her handling of religion. Unsure as to whether she should acceed to Catholic or Reformist demands, she ended up making concessions for both, to create the more current form of religion. Ultimately, Haigh concludes that as much as Elizabeth I concentrated on her image, she ended her reign relatively unpopular and not as successful as historians have portrayed her in the past. While Elizabeth I's previous historians may have been to generous in their assessments, Elizabeth certainly had more direct effect on her country and rule than Haigh gives her credit for in his work."
4,WWE Money in the Bank 2012 review,"Smackdown's MITB match was a pretty good,hard-hitting,high-flying bout despite some mess-ups & dumb moments. The World's title match between Sheamus & Alberto Del Rio was a solid,back-and-forth bout to say the least. The Bonus tag team match between the team of Primo & Epico and The Prime Time Players(Titus O'Neil & Darren Young) had nice high-flying,double teaming,brawling action. The WWE title match between CM Punk & Daniel Bryan started off pretty good then things really picked up when weapons got involved and AJ played the conflicted referee very well. The handicap match between Ryback & the team of Curt Hawkins & Tyler Reks while not the best match on the card,Hawkins & Reks put up a better fight then Rybacks's past victims. The 6 divas tag team match started off pretty good but fell apart in the end. Not to mention it was short for it's own good. The Raw MITB was a smash-mouth,power-driven,nail-biting brawl. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
1,"Very boring, like most WWE PPVs nowadays.","This was one of the worst PPV's the WWE has seen in months. The crowd wasn't even into most of it. The only decent matches were for the WWE championship and the Raw MITB match. The Smackdown MITB match was insanely boring and the tag team match with AW (is that even a word or a name?) was just as painful to watch. This ppv had so many no name matches it made me sick. WWE has gone so far down the crapper with PPVs that they can't even fill a full 3 hour show. How do they expect to move Raw to 3 hours if they can't do a 3 hour ppv anymore even? They always end 10-15 minutes early. Oh, and the Miz looked even more retarded with his new hair. And to give Cena a win in his first MITB match ever just disrespects everything that Chris Jericho has done in a longer career."
2,Boring,"Alex's artwork is phenomenal as always, but this has to be the most boring comic book ever written. The story involves Wonder Woman wondering how she could be more effective in her task here on earth as an ambassador of peace. While she's doing this you get to look at some paintings by Alex Ross. The End."
4,Holt the presses! Lucia's back in battle!,"Having read all of the original Benson books and the sequels by Tom Holt, I think I am something of a Lucia-expert. Therefore, I can certainly feel the difference in style between the Benson books and this wonderful Holt pastiche, but I still love it. England is at war, as are Mapp and Lucia. The battle in Tilling goes to the one who gathers the most officers for their parties. Naturally, Queen Lucia leads the fray, but Elizabeth has an ace up her sleeve in the form of a distant cousin who serves in the military. The campaign against Germany has nothing on the intrigues of those nemesi of Tilling. Holt does an admirable job of breathing life into these characters, and his obviously knowledge about and affection for the original saga makes this novel a joy."
3,Misleading,"My 4 year old is tiny and normally wears a size 8 1/2 -9 shoe.So you can imagine my surprise when I snuck in her room to try these shoes on her while she was sleeping before Christmas, to figure out if I need to return them.A sensible parent will allow at least a 1/2 size for growth, which i did.I wish some of the reviews would have mentioned that these shoes run small because they are very narrow at the toe.Very pretty and slip resistant, which I like! Just do yourself a favor and buy at least a size and 1/2 up from what your child normally wears:(Christmas is in 6 days so I have to see if I can find a better fit with another shoe!What a shame!"
3,Science fiction detective with sidekick,"Although I had seen Dr. Who on television a few times, I had never read a Dr. Who book. Perhaps I shouldn't have started with the end of a trilogy, but I didn't notice the difference -- the story seemed complete. This genre of science fiction with a bit of farce has to grow on you. Really, as Dr. Who and his female sidekick Ace (no romantic involvement) go gallivanting around Wales and some other planet (reached through a Stonehenge-like gateway), there's not much science in it at all. You have to be a Dr. Who fan to really get into this reworked genre. The fantasy is druidic, the farcical science fiction is Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy toned down a few notches, and the plot is detective. Could call it a Sherlock Holmes parallel except it's already modernised, so more like Mr. Bean as Monk. Still, with all this whinging (see, it made me go British!) I still read to the end and it was fun."
2,"Looking for the song from ""My Life Without Me?""","FYI - My Life Without Me has no soundtrack available. But imdb.com gave me enough info to at least pin down this song. ""Sometime later"" from this album is what's playing at the end credits of My Life Without Me. (And the song playing in the car when Lee and Ann kiss is ""Senza Fine"", I forget the artist.)"
3,see BB playing in other arenas,"I like this disk. It's a good disk. But if you wait to hear Blues here (as real blues) you are wrong. This disk is excellent for fans of B.B. King, cause you hear him playing in a pop way. He even plays Rap! It has an amazing song with Bonnie Raitt. Excellent crew, althought it's not strictly blues"
3,Do yourself a favour - don't buy,"I love BB, but this album swamps BB with its all star cast and misses the mark. The album ends up presenting an R&B front rather than the blues. While I enjoy some of the tracks such as 'The thrill is gone' with Tracy Chapman, in general it disapppoints. The absolute lowlight is BB contributing to a rap song."
4,Great for everyday,"These are great, everyday wine glasses, dishwasher safe and sturdy, yet good-looking enough to use for company. And a great value!"
3,4 of 12 Bases Irregular,"Geez... the reviews are really good, however 4 of 12 goblets have irregular bases and wobble. The set is okay if you can deal with some imperfection. Cheers!"
3,Not the best looking wine glasses,"Very durable but look ugly and old fashioned, actually they look old!!But well they were really cheap"
1,Horrible.,"I liked the first Darren Shan books, they were imaginative and unique for children's novels. But, the writing style does not fit the tone set for the series anymore. The first books were written from the point of view of a 12~ year old, but he does not seem to grow up in the series at all. By this book, when he should be at least in his late twenties he still acts like a 12 year old.Shan's writing style has not improved either. His action sequences are so poorly written and confusing that you have to read them several times to even begin to comprehend what is going on. What you can understand is terribly boring, written as if the vampires and vampaneze were taking turns fighting, and ends up being very anticlimatic.I suggest to fans of the series to read it themselves and make their own opinions on it."
4,Not as good as Darwinia,"This is a slightly above-average book, among the books that I choose to finish. I did take the time to finish this one, which says something for it. But it is not nearly the book that Wilson's Darwinia is, and I was disappointed on that score."
1,Don't read this book!,"If you don't mind not knowing the history or the background of a story and just like reading about how the main characters are going to die, if you like bilogical warfare and don't really care if the characters succed in thier quest, cause they won't, or if you want to waste 8 hours of your life. Please read this book. I am a big fan of ""hard"" sci-fi, but this one falls short. I would call it a very small space opera that has no point."
2,A seed that failed in its promise,"Perhaps this thing was intended to be experimental. If so, the experiment failed. The piuty of it is that this is good writing, with a strong theme and a solid, malleable plot. The entire first half of the book is good, the third quartter is what I can only describe as pregnant recividism -- and the fourth quarter pretty much dumps the story. A carefully build-up potential trickles down into futility.I can't say I didn't like the book. I can only say that I probably would have."
2,Well-written but peters out in the end,"I've read all of Mr. Wilson's books and he is getting better all of the time. The problem he faces is that his books, always excellently conceived, usually peter out by the end. As in BIOS, the characters are basically victims of a (well-conceived) planetary environment, the ""bios"" of the title. The characters are mostly stock and are removed from the novel one by one in such a way as to give the impression that the book has no real plot. It just ends, leaving me with the impression, ""Is that all there is?"" To Mr. Wilson's credit, the book is excellently written and the sci-fi elements all credible and in place. It's not a bad read, but I wanted more ""novelistic"" elements threaded throughout the book. I wanted a plot."
2,Misleading Part 2,"Forgot to add, author/contributor Eric Schiller is nothing more than a mouthpiece for Dogmatic ideas. He wouldn't know an original chess idea if it came up and bit him on his you know what. His mentality is the sort that attacked Aron Nimzowitsch's ideas before Nimzo proved his critics wrong. Take anything that Schiller or his associates say with a grain of salt."
4,Very good quality for reasonable price.,"I using this blanket every day and it completely satisfied my needs. It is warm and light weight item. But it is good only at climate like New York, where temperature not lower then 25-32F"
1,The real torture is reading this book,If the US wants to torture prisoners they should force them to read this poorly written book. Very unimpressive writing that makes the book hard to follow.
3,"Good , but ...",I have to admit that this book helped me a great deal to understand hierarchical and nested models. However I find the examples and applications used in this book rather poor. I would like to see a similar book with the same great insight but with better examples and clearer discussion especially the assumptions and some theoretical aspects behind the logic of hierarchical modelling.
4,Really good picking exercises,"This video is really good for learning picking, but if you are looking for a video that teaches you chords you would be beter off looking for another video.Pete realized that he should've been teaching picking strings first, then having his students move to chords next, thus we have this video.On another note, Pete Seger fans will enjoy watching this video and seeing Pete play, and hearing his stories about playing. There are also some shots of his playing on stage."
2,"I have VHS versions complete with commercials, pregame, halftime, postgame","I have complete versions of these on VHS (some transferred from BETA) with pre-game, halftime, post-game and commercials. The quality is even better than what is on the DVD for SB 9&10. The NFL should have taken their time with this and got it right. My biggest complaint isn't even the quality, but the fact that you don't get the pre-game, halftime and post game."
1,What was NFL Films thinking?,"Let me start by saying I am not a Steelers fan. Unfortunately, my Cowboys are on two of these discs, and I love a chance to watch Roger, the original T.D. and Hollywood. I pray... that the Dallas Cowboys set is NOWHERE near the quality these games are. I've found multiple versions of these games on the internet that put these ""digitally mastered"" copies to complete shame. Super Bowl X is almost unwatchable and Super Bowl IX? Oofa... The unfortunate thing is, this was a chance to 'get it right' and the NFL blew it big. I rated it one star only because I wasn't sure if ZERO stars would register a review here. Don't waste your money. Go find the games on the internet somewhere."
1,"Never buy a white high chair! No matter how ""pretty""...","We are borrowing this chair from grandmother. It is pretty, but the WHITE print seat padding is highly impractical! Shows stains quickly. Don't buy this color! ALSO, my 18 month old learned quickly how to remove the tray and throw it on the floor (food and all) letting us know he was ""all done."" Look for one that latches more securely."
5,Highchair used by grandparents,"Needed a highchair to care for latest grandson, this one is better and easier to use than what we used back in the 1970s - by far. Easy to clean and very stable. Just be careful not to trip over the legs yourself as that stability results from the legs extending out a little further than I was expecting. The 8 month-old likes to investigate the non-removable base of the tray when getting into it."
4,great!,"This high chair is just what I wanted, except for one thing-the tray will fall off if pulled out too far to take your child out. (Some trays lock at the end) It's not a big deal, but I do prefer that it would lock. I love the color, it fits close to baby, it folds flat, it rolls, it's pretty great!"
3,"Great mobility and stability, so hard to clean","I have wanted to get rid of this high chair since about a week after I bought it. Food gets lodged in every nook and cranny and it is so hard to clean it out. I have kept it because it is so easy to wheel around. I am considering buying another Graco, but I'm scared that it will also be hard to clean..."
3,Slight Regrets,"I slightly regret purchasing this highchair. The areas where the chair legs join stick out quite far from the chair and are located high up on the chair. She has hit her head on this area several times as I have been securing the straps when putting her into the chair. I have now noticed the leg joints do not stick out so far in other chairs and the joints are not located so close to the area where the child's head will rest.Also, the chair is not well padded. It was sometimes audible when she would bring her head back to rest between bites. I placed a towel between the padding and the chair to alleviate the problem.On a positive note, the highchair has held up well and is easy to clean. The straps are easily adjustable and I know she is safe and secure in the highchair (of course, she is always closely supervised)."
1,dont understand all the positive reviews ...,"I originally ordered the safety first kensington bc of its beautiful looks, wipeable seat and small fold. When I got it together it didn't fold as compact as I needed so I ordered this graco in rittenhouse. I thought based on positive reviews id love it even though it wasn't my first choice. First thing I noticed is it is significantly heavier than the s1. The fabric is super cheap feeling. It's white and black which looks like cream and black on the photo and doesn't really make sense bc the frame is cream. It'snot made of a even slightly wipeable material. Its plan fabric which would stain horribly. It's way too short and the seat sitting area is not very deep and looks way uncomfortable. Needless to say, id rather the other take up room in my teeny tiny kitchen than put up with this garbage. If you want something better quality with a beautiful look go for the safety 1st kensington from babies r us."
5,My boy loves it.,"Should I say that the highchair met my son's expectations. Normally, he doesn't like to be seated and strapped. But when he is on this highchair, he seems to be comfortable and looking forward to feeding. I haven't tried washing/wiping the cover. Love the extra tray, easy to cleanup after each use and leave behind the first one for the baby to continue to play with his toys. The fact that it saves space and can be carried around gives another plus. I recommend this highchair for babies 6 months+ based on comfort and ease of use."
4,good looking model,"I got this model because it could fold easily and the wheels could be locked. Although I have had time to fold it only twice in 2 months and never had to lock/unlock the wheels because our dining area is carpeted, I love this high chair. It looks very good and what's more my 5 month old loved it at the very firs tsight.Someone did mention that the baby's arm can get stuck in the space between the chair and the edge. This could be a problem if the baby is chubby. My daughter is almost 7 moth old but her arm can get in and out of it right now."
2,Quality and Fit Issues,I have been wearing Doc Marten's for years and never had a complaint.These boots are not nearly as well made as boots I have bought in the past and are uncomfortable to wear for an extended time... say all day at work.Quality and comfort are about the same as you would expect to find in a discount store at a much lower price.Note > these boots are made in China. Previous Marten products I bought were made in the UK.Last Dr. Marten product I'll be buying.
2,"This book has a huge error, but otherwise OK","The huge error is in the table of cases at the back of the book. The page references to many cases are clearly incorrect, so it is practically impossible to look up a case in this book.Otherwise, the text of the book is informative and well written. Hope the authors will fix the page reference problem in the next edition."
3,The pictures are poor quality so its too hard to learn from,"I saw this book at a store. I was going to buy it until I saw the pictures. The pictures look like they were either underdeveloped, or taken in a room that was too dark. I was interrested in the book for the throws, not the history or the principles. If you are trying to learn the throws in the book you will get a headache. The placement of the hands and feet are hard to see. I think that it would be hard for a non grappler or thrower to learn from the book. I know some throws and grappling techniques so I could figure them out. Its a good book, but the pictures bought it down to 3 stars for me."
2,Not what I expected.,This book is overpriced for what you get.Much smaller and cheaper quality than I had hoped.Would not recommend it.
1,piece of junk!,"first off the book arrived several days late and there was no real ""tracking"". it was nothing but dates and ""arrival scan"" but it didn't tell me where it arrived.Secondly the book sucks. The spaces are way too small to write in unless you are about the size of a smurf.the sad thing is is that i can't find anything better to replace it. if anyone knows of a auto record book that is bigger please let me know!"
3,Too involved,"Was trying to find a simple one, this was more involved than my husband wanted. Other than that it was fine."
4,Super handy!,"I'm glad I got this book! I use it to track gas consumption and MPG over time as well as maintenance (oil changes, etc.) and repairs. I keep track of when the cars get washed and/or waxed on a blank page. I was a little confused at first that they have ""Gas and Oil"" and a ""Lubrication"" section. I guess the oil part of Gas and Oil is for if you need to give the car more oil between changes. In any case, it's really handy so I got one for each of my vehicles."
3,Not for working out,It is a nice product with no way of carrying except in you pocket. Not good for someone who wants to use it to run and work out with.
2,THE BEST OF...? PLEASE!,"Once the music critic darlings of Canada, the Police-esque Payolas have all but faded into obscurity when they were one of the best of the 80's bands. So this is the best the Payolas are to be remembered by?Most of the cuts are from the same album! How about the incredible Won't Be Any Prisoners, or the anti-domestic violence Hammer on a Drum, or the giddy Waiting for the Light to Change or the perennial x-mas favorite Christmas is Coming? The Payolas deserve much better. The only reason they even get 2 stars is for the band themselves! And where are the original recordings, anyway. I can't find them on Amazon or anywhere else, much like the great missing CDs of bands like Dave Edmunds, the Dellords and Roman Holliday!"
2,An excellent overview of artistic decline,"Canada's Payola$ started out as a great, anthemic punk/new wave pop band, but by the time they were done, they'd descended into David Foster-produced commercial bid hell. The eleven songs here are in chronological order, allowing us to carefully trace the band's artistic decline. It begins strong with ""China Boys"" and ""In a Place Like This"" and includes the smartly crafted, reggae-inflected ""Eyes of a Stranger,"" but it goes downhill from there. Insult is added to injury in that the group's dreadful final album Here's the World For Ya is represented by more songs (4) than any of their other records. Even fans of 80s commercial fluff (like Chicago, Foster's other clients at the time) will have a hard time swallowing the final four.This is not the best way to be introduced to the Payola$, but unless some enterprising label is going to reissue the band's albums, it's unfortunately the only way. ""In a Place Like This"" is almost worth the price on its own. Almost."
4,Ronnie James Doi as i grew up with,A great cd of Dio i grew up with in the old day when the elves played at r senior dance and at the warehouse in Kirkwood New york
4,5 stars for the music 3 stars for the transfer,"These two albums are definitely among Dio's best work,along with rainbow and a couple of the Sabbath recordings.Both are better than the first Elf album..It has more diverse styles of music than any of the other bands mentioned.Boogie shuffles to blues-rock to soothing spacey ballads to swaggering beats.The problem with this release is that there is a glitch at the beginning of Liberty Road.This is an official release so the only excuse for this is if something damaged the original master since the original release.If so ,I think it should be easy enough to fix by lifting that second or two of music from later in the song as it is repeated ,or from a copy of the vinyl.I have the original and it doesn't have that glitch.Any way it's pretty much inexcusable for an official release.Although personally, out of all of the songs from the Tryin'to Burn the Sun album ,liberty road isn't particularly a stand out so I'll only deduct one star over all."
5,Dio is GOD,"Man... I will be short.If you like what Dio did with sabbath or with his solo career...You gotta listen to this... you won't believe...His voice man... his voice!!!We miss you man!!!Hail Dio forever!!!GREAT ALBUM, by the way =)"
5,The Elf Albums-Connoisseur Collection-VSOP CD 167,"Just got this yesterday and listening to it the second time right now. I have the first album called elf, wonder if that's oop. Anyway a few reviews say the audio transfer on this disc is lacking. Sounds good on this end. The packaging doesn't mention remastering but it sounds like it has been. Sounds very clean. It's not the super loud mastered sound that is common on todays discs. If you like the high volume remasters have you seen this: [...] .Something to think about."
2,Don't like this book,"I had this book in my college algebra class, and non of the students liked it. It didn't explain things well enough to enable you to do the chapter problems. The teacher explain everything in class using her own notes and only used the book for us to practice the math problems. If anyone missed a day of class, they were in trouble because they missed the teachers notes, which was the only way to understand the problems in the book. I hope the school stops using this book. I'm sure there are other better college algebra books out there."
1,Worst I've ever had,"I don't really feel like doing a detailed criticism, but I'm typically real good at math and I'm used to learning out of the book. This has to be the absolute worst I've ever encountered."
3,"""Good"" kids gone bad","Jan Coffey is the name that this husband/wife duo write their thrillers under. I have enjoyed many of their books in the past and liked this one, too, for the most part. There were a lot of unexplained ""holes"" in the story that I wish the authors had filled in a bit more. The writing duo has a lot of technical knowledge between them from previous careers and they usually do a better job of explaining the ""whys"" of a story than they did in this one. The ending was up in the air so I don't know whether a sequel is planned although I doubt it - they haven't written sequels in the past as far as I know.I enjoyed the premise of the book. I liked the interaction between Dr. Mom and the Secret Service agent. I liked the story flashing to different locales. I would read the book again even with its weaknesses because I enjoy the writing style of this writing team."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book after reading ""Resurrecting Mingus"" which I enjoyed. I did not like ""Selah's Bed"" as it never really a caught my attention. I believe the constant moving back and forth between present and past was a disservice to the book and the reader. In addition, many questions were unanswered. The author could have talked about her husband and his feelings about his wife's knowledge of her affairs. How did the lovers feel about her? I felt there were a lot of things that were left out of this book that should have been in it."
4,USB VOIP Phone,The phone is universal and loads most of the software available for it from other companies .. was easy to install .. but needed newer software when it arrived. Very good value for the money. Many companies use this phone under multiple brands .. its a chinese made clone
3,"Awesome music but not his ""best""","Skip this ""best of"" (hardly) CD. Taken on its own, the music on the disc is great but it does not represent Nugent's ""best"" (it fails to include his two most popular songs -""stranglehold"" and ""cat scratch fever""). If you are looking for a hit package I would suggest that you pick up ""super hits"", ""great gonzos"", or better yet, the ""out of control"" 2 disc set (this in the only ""best of"" collection that contains the legendary ""great white buffalo"")."
5,"Well written, enjoyable to read","I really liked this book, As a Norwegian I have read and been learned in School of the Vikings, our heritage. I was still amazed over new information I did not know, and it inspired me to revisit many of the old sites with a new view of who they were.Great book, a must read for people with interest in the Vikings"
2,Good product but short life,This is good product as long as it works but the handset don't charge anymore after 1.5 years of regular use the handset died bought new batteries but of no use it still won't charge.The base shows the charge led lit but it never charges
1,Disappointed Horrible taste,This is the first time amazon has failed me with the great feedback this product has it was good during the first week but after the second week it taste went downhill... I gave it one star because now i just use it to mix in milkshakes that way it doesn't go to waste...
5,"Great taste, great price!",I have tried a few brands of Whey Protein and this is my favorite. It's not gritty and taste great! Too bad Amazon hasn't had the 5 pound Strawberry in stock for months.
3,Not in love with the flavor,I had purchased the plain stuff and decided to try the vanilla. I mix it with berries to make a smoothie. The vanilla flavor is too strong for me.
3,wrong instruction in it............,I ordered this due to the fact that online the nutritional info it said 60g of protein PER scoop! When I received it I was very disappointed to learn that it is 30G per scoop not 60. The nutritional info on this website is WRONG! So be aware that it is only 30 grams of protein per scoop!
5,Best tasting whey,"I had mostly been using optimum nutrition's whey which is very good too, but ran out and my local grocery store had this product in a 2 pound size. Now Sports has a good reputation for supplements and I was really really pleased with the flavor of this. It is somewhat like a creamy malted chocolate shake. By far it is the most enjoyable tasting whey protein I've ever had and mixes as well as any. This product will definitely continue to be on my list of whey products. Yum!"
2,This book was a struggle to finish.,The characters in Pride were not well developed. There were boring chapters which for me was a struggle to finish because it was not interesting enough to hold my attention. This was my first time reading Lorene Cary's work. I would not recommend this ONE!!!
5,Long overdue study of America killing grounds.....,Huddleston is a brilliant visionary with an extraordinary eye for the subtexts of the cultural landscape. This book is essential to an understanding of the implications of history on contemporary life and to exploring the critical pathways to evaluating our own beliefs.Hooray for Huddleston!!
5,comfy,Bought these for my son and he loves them. He has purchased Rockports for years due to their comfort and loves them.
4,good shoe,very comfortable shoes and good for day to day work. and also it's very thick that good for wearing in the winter
3,"Great construction, nice box/bicycle toe.","This shoe was purchased to accommodate a custom orthotic for my flat feet. With the orthotic in place, my heal rubs the collar to the point of blistering by the end of an 8 hour day. I like the shoe very much, but, if you intend to use with an orthotic thicker than 1 centimeter - look else where."
5,Great comfy shoes for the office,"I'm a New Yorker so about half of my commute is by foot. Before I found these shoes, I had just about given up on my search for comfy shoes besides sneakers to wear to work. I had found nice-looking shoes that were stiff and comfy shoes that were ugly. In my latest attempt to find a nice shoe, I stumbled across these Rockports and I was amazed. They're so comfy and attractive. It has a very cushion-y sole that makes for walking on sidewalks very nice (something that hurts my feet in my Ecco's). While I wear these mostly to work, they go great with jeans as well.The only possible problem with these shoes is that the sole is pretty soft so they may wear out sooner than you want. For me, that isn't a problem.. I like these so much, I'd be happy to buy another pair!"
5,"Well-built, but light weight","DH LOVES these shoes; cut very true to size; comfortable year-round; great arch support; really light weight, but very well made with good leather upper."
1,"Shoes arrived on time, but were scuffed - clearly a store ""sample"" pair","Received these shoes on time - and I know from having owned many pairs of the black style, they are incredibly comfortable.However, they arrived with a department store sales tag stapled to the bottom of each, and were scuffed and clearly worn - indicating that they were a department store sample model before being boxed and shipped to me.I love the shoe - but I'm returning these and going to pick up an actual ""new"" pair from a local store.I'm sure Amazon isn't responsible for this - but the shoe vendor provided a very unfortunate experience."
2,2 stars a bit much.....,"I gave this CD 2 stars because it only has 2 good tracks!!! (Track 1 and Track 2....THATS IT!!) I would give this CD 1 star but these 2 tracks happen to be really good (one of which is a single!!) The rest of the CD.....GAWBAGE, GAWBAGE I SAY!!!!:{ Dont bother your ears with the rest of those garbage tracks...better luck next time ""Bravery""."
3,Good Stuff,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'd have to agree with Jasper (a few reviews up)...What's said in his review definitely hit all the points of the strengths and weaknesses of the Bravery's debut album. Bravo.I'd just like to add that I seriously believe that The Bravery do have the potential to become monumental- if they play their cards right.The only difference in what I think is that they deserve a 3.5 or higher."
2,dissapointing,"well most of what i'd want to say has already been said so i'll get to the point.. you either love this, think it all sounds the same and a cheap 80's rip off, or hate this and all that the 80 ectro had to offer.... i guess i'd fall into the cheap 80's rip off catagory... an honest mistake was at least a glimse of what the cd could of done but instead made a cd full of sound a like songs never crossing too far into a differnt style...to compare them to the killers which mostly everyone does, this cd is but a quarter of the worth that hot fuss was.. if you like all that is depeche mode and want more? buy the bravery's weak attept at glory. if you just like the killers and not much else of this style of music.. you can go without them."
2,Just Get Franz Ferdinand,"I'm not going to tell you they should be in the 80's or that theyre posers or anything like that. Youve already heard that. Heres all im gonna say. If you even almost like the way they sound, just get the franz ferdinand cd instead. Trust me on this one. Everything from the vocals to the general music is like franz ferdinand but with less talent. So theyr you go."
4,Oh come on!,"Here's the deal guys and gals. Let's be honest, if you have bought this cd then your wheels have been turning for some time now. You want the real info on the brave? then tune in because here it is. I agree, Cure...uh yeah... Strokes... uhh yeah,...Killers...uhhh yeah... dash of intepol? Blueprint! This CD is a state side release that lacks the mystique of import releases. The debut of the Bravery's self titled ablum proves that following in the footprints of other succesfull 80ish revival bands pays off! I don't know what your looking for when you snap on this disc but there is one thing you have to admit... it's fun! if your bummed that it isn't 'more original' or it doesn't 'sound unique' then it's your own fault! you paid attention to it in the 1st place because it sounds like everything else you enjoy. Take it for what it's worth, judge the book by its cover and dig this CD because it's familiar and a blast! ipso facto, vi-sa vi or whatever!!!"
1,Matchbox 20 does Robert Smith?,"I'm all for this post-punk revival, but anyone who strives that hard to sound like Robert Smith shouldn't be writing songs like Matchbox 20. I think the Bravery mark the end of this great Eighties trend - or at least its nadir. Which means they'll probably go platinum."
1,"Good Story, Bad Writing","The premise and ""story"" of this novel were great, but the writing is so amatuerish it is amazing it got published.Can there be any more 4-letter words in this thing? I'm not a prude, but these words should be used like salt - just enough to season, too much and its unbearable. The characters seem to suffer from Turrets.Also, the writing is full of cliches ""the room was spinning"", ""his/her eyes were moist"", ""stomach was in knots"". And everthing was like in-a-movie. The car ""shined like in a movie"", ""Ah Mr Bond...""The ending had a good twist, but the writing made it hard to give it above 1 Star. If it becomes a movie, I hope they get a good script writer."
2,An enjoyable read if you leave reason at the door.,"A young man with little ambition goes from low level loser to the corporate penthouse in a matter of weeks. Although well written, the tale is too implausible for a higher rating."
4,entertaining,i enjoyed this book and it kept my interest the whole way through. the ending was so/so or i would have given it 5 stars
3,Entertaining yet not great,"This is a good read in the sense that I wanted to keep turning the page, I wanted to know what will happen next. Yet the plot is a little silly and it falls apart in the next to last scene. I'm glad it was free, otherwise I would have been disappointed if I had paid $9.99 for it."
5,My kind of book...,"Cant seem to put it down...carry it all over with me, dont mind being in doctor's office as this suspense book has my on the edge of my seat. Cant wait for the ending, had to write a review even though not finished yet."
3,Not Bad but Not Great,I bought this book based on the book Killer Instinct by the same author. That book was exceptionally good but this one was only fair. It is about a young man who pulls a prank at his job and in order to say out of jail he must get hired by the competion and become a corporate spy. Three quarters through the book I could see where the story was heading but there was still some surprises. Could have been a better ending.
3,Lives up to the hype (3 1/2 stars)...,"Adam Cassidy knew that embezzling money would ruin his career. But instead of ending up in prison, he goes from doing gopher work to having the proverbial corner office. He drives a fancy car, possesses an unlimited bank account and is able to cover his father's medical expenses. However, he's achieved said merits by submitting to blackmail and becoming a corporate spy. And things take a turn toward disarming...I am not a fan of this sort of thriller, but I nevertheless enjoyed Paranoia. I like the fact that Adam is the cynical, apathetic type. The aforementioned character makes the novel interesting for me. I did not like the corporate jargon and the you'd-better-carry-plenty-of-KY-Jelly retorts that seem to come straight out of a blockbuster film starring Tom Cruise. I have no doubts that a successful film will be made out of this novel. Paranoia isn't food for the brain, but for sheer entertainment value it can't be beaten. Recommended..."
1,Thin is In,"Although the sales certainly haven't lived up to the hype, I thought I'd try this one anyway because of the many 5-star reviews here on Amazon, which I've always found very helpful in the past. BIG mistake! This book is anorexic - where is the content? where is the joy of the written word? where is the interest, creativity, heart? Honestly - where is the author? I couldn't keep my mind in the story for wondering at the thinness of the craft and the blatantly formulaic plot and characters.It's one thing to want an easy, entertaining read for a plane flight. But there's more to a third reading of ""Skymall"" than there is to this one."
2,For ppl who read more...mature novels i guess.,"This was an amazing book...I LOVED it. I actually bought it for my older sisters birthday but ended up reading it myself. It's for 12-13 year olds, probably really mature for their age. Younger readers will probably find it boring-and a little inappropriate. Ummm...how about this: if you've read Dan Brown novels and liked them, you can read this book. I would recommend asking an older sibling or parent to censor it though. Nothing fancy, just a couple of pages should be folded."
5,"Sorry, and thank you for your kindness...","With so much evil and mistrust floating around one sometimes gets deluded by misconceptions, much like judging people in the blink of an eye. In such situations one can only hope that a sincere apology would be expected and that one will be forgiven..."
3,I'm being generous with three stars!,I'm absolutely amazed by the reviews of this book. I'm still turning pages wondering if someone cut a last chapter out of mine because there is no ending in the book. It had so much potential in the plot and fell far far short at the end. So disappointing!
3,A primer for the forgotten 70's powerhouse,"Cheryl Lynn remains one for the ages: a voice that transcended her material and the short time that she was in the limelight. This ""Sony Special Products"" disc doesn't even scrape the surface of the explosive vocalist. Culled from her 1978 debut album (6 cuts), 1980's ""In Love"" (2 tracks), the title cut from 1984's ""Preppie"", and ""It's Gonna Be Right from 1985 (1 cut), there are still some glaring omissions, specifically her duet with Luther Vandross (""If This World Were Mine"") and her R & B smash ""Encore"".If one is just interested in a few choice Lynn samples, then this is the one to have. However, the true fan would be best to invest in ""Got to Be Real: The Best of Cheryl Lynn""."
1,no,This toy is 63 times less than the 1019 and is 10 dollars less. if you still don't get it then wake up and smell the coffee
4,Pretty damn good,"Crows have always been one of my favorite bands, and though I often don't buy singles, I decided to make an exception to hear Mercury (a track I previously was fairly ambivolant over) live, as well as one of my favorite Crows' songs, Goodnight Elizabeth.It didn't disappoint.Crows have always been referred to as a live band, and this is an excellent example. The two live tracks are spectacular, not to mention the classy (and cathy!) Hangin' Around (track one of 'This Desert Life')Well worth a buy; even for those cynics who never buy singles!"
3,Why don't they write good thrillers anymore?,"I read _Force 10_ before I read _Guns_, and loved them both. They're genre pieces, and there are predictable elements of plot and character, but if you take that for granted, they fulfill your expectations very well. _Force 10_ lacks the classic, simple story of _Guns_, but has a wonderful combination of humor and action, as well as a truly stunning climax. There seems to have been some revisionist history between the publication of the first book and the sequel -- Dusty Miller is inexplicably altered (for the better) from an unbelievable, constantly drawling American to an elegant and unflappable Brit (a bit reminiscent of John Steed from the Avengers). There IS a woman in this book -- not Ripley, admittedly, but she does more than look pretty and get rescued (yeah, she does that too)."
1,Why?,"I read this book because my friend recommended it to me. Well I recommend to everyone reading this review to stay away from this book which bores you with facts. Run, dont walk, away from this book."
2,overdone,"While many of the flaws which pestered the first episode of this series were no longer to be found in the second one and neither have reappeared here -that constant use of those double surnames, though...I cannot say I am completely about the novel though.Mr James decided to play the card of the witty parody of the sleuth stories and he lets his main hero explicitly mention the fact. This plot device though is not as funny as one could imagine though, at least not in the long run.Simon looks again a little too self complacent and his dialogues with the handsome Inspector Chase are a lot less sparkling than they could have been. Even the sexual tension between him and the same inspector as well as that with Giles appear dimmer than they could have been.A fun read, but less than expected, not to mention the annoying inconsistencies scattered here and there, such as a statement about Giles not being aware of his beauty followed by right the opposite one after no more than two pages."
2,Beware the cost of consumables!,"This printer works well, but as was mentioned by several other posters, the consumables are outrageously expensive (as is true with most inkjet printers). There are refill kits available, but they are difficult to use.I would recommend that you go with a Canon inkjet for the lowest total cost of ownership."
2,"Too much story-telling, too little musical analysis","The biggest flaw of this book, aside from the inclusion of works that don't sound musical at all to this regressive classical music lover, is most of the essays are heavy on background information and very light on musical analysis. The problem with this approach is, first, if you cross-reference what Steinberg writes in the mini-biographies with something like Wikipedia, you'll find lots of disagreements over ""facts"" about composers' lives and musical developments and also about each piece's specific development, and second, all that background info doesn't help one understand the music better. I wish Steinberg had included more musical analysis, even if that's less than accessible to the non-specialist, and less ""chatty"" talk."
2,Weird,"Bizarre omissions -- too may masters of the concerto ignored. Overblown writing -- does not hit the ""sweet spot"" between the technical and the dramatic. In all, I found it useless. Easier to just ""Google"" something I am interested in. In sum, I deleted it."
4,"Incomplete, But Far From Worthless","This book is a good collection for study. You cannot rely on the key move solutions provided as some are simply wrong and all are provided as one key move without principal variations. If you have a modern computer chess program you will still benefit from solving the problems if you check your solution with your own computer. In fairness to the author, he recomends exactly this approach to working with the book. I was aware of the incomplete solutions as well as the fact that the computer progarm used in the book preparation was primative by modern standards before I made my purchase, therefore I was not disappointed."
3,Good But It Falls Short! Not For the Novice!,This book of combinations takes real positions for white winning or mating. I still wonder why he did not include great games where the player of the black pieces wins or mates. I disagree with others who say the combination need to be in categories. This makes you think harder and is better than looking for a certain type of combination or move. This is a more realistic approach. This why I say this book is not for the novice. The first move of the solution is given and sometimes it is enough but not all time. When you can't solve the position in reasonable amount of time going over the solution can help improve your skills also.
1,Product is not dried properly and can rapidly mold,"These apricots are of high quality, however they seem to be packaged too moist, and rapidly develop a white mold. The spooky part is, the mold looks like sugar, and some folks, especially kids, might mistake it for a normal condition. A couple of other things are odd: There is no expiration date on the package, and each bag has a hole in the bottom, looking as if it has been punctured by a needle. After a month or so in storage, all 8 of my remaining bags were in the same decomposing condition.Please see attached pictures under product information, images section."
5,Satisfying food,I was grateful to the review who pointed out that there is a white coating on these apricots. I would like to point out that the product information explains how to read the freshness date on the packages. I am very glad I purchased these apricots. They are a satisfying snack.
5,My favorite Chicks CD,"I have all the Dixie Chicks CDs, and this one is my favorite. If you like the Chicks, bluegrass, and tight harmony, this CD is for you."
1,BORING,"THIS RECORD HAS 3 GREAT SONGS, BUT THATS IT. HOWEVER, I LOVE THEM AND I LOVE NATALIE FOR ALL HER WORK FOR THE WEST MEMPHIS THREE"
5,AWESOME CD,"Honestly, everyone needs this CD. It is awesome. All the songs on this CD are great. Easy to sing along to and very relaxing. Fun and upbeat but also slow and peaceful with a good message."
5,Chicks Best Yet,"Yeah, the chicks are back and better than ever.This is by far the best album yet. I can't enough of it! This is real country!Thanks Chicks for not selling out like so many other country artists and trying to appeal to the pop stations!"
5,The Dixie Chicks Best Album (so far...),"Been waiting way too long for this treat. The best Dixie Chicks album yet. Fine instrumental work from Martie, Emily, Lloyd Maines, Adam Steffie (Guitar), Bryan Sutton (Mando) and Byron House (Bass) with Natalie's beautiful yet powerful vocal's and the tightest ""Chicks"" harmonies yet. Special treats are Emmylou Harris vocals on ""Godspeed"" and Chris Thile (Nickel Creek) playing mando on ""A Home"", ""Lil' Jack Slade"" (great solo) and ""More Love"". Recorded in the heart of Texas music, Austin.Buy this One!!!!"
2,They can't all be winners,"I am a huge fan of their first two CDs, but 'Home' is a major disappointment. 'Wide Open Spaces' and 'Fly' both had four to five *great* songs. Only 'Long Time Gone' and the instrumental 'Lil' Jack Slade' on this CD are even remotely close. Musically the girls are as great as ever, but their choice of material in this case is execrable."
4,It's worth the buy,"I wasn't immediately obsessed with this cd as I was their first two, but it's growing on me. I enjoy their adaptation of ""Landslide"" even tho I'm not fond of remakes. ""White Trash Wedding"" has some good music, but the lyrics were a waste of time and felt like just a filler. Also, not real fond of ""Top of the World"". They do have some hits on here with ""Travelin' Soldier"", ""Long Time Gone"", and I really like ""Truth No.2"" Overall, a very good compilation. I think lots of people will be somewhat disappointed if they think this is of the same caliper as the first two albums, but that's just my opinion."
2,Just not the Chicks I know......,"I have loved listening to their previous two cd's over the years so I was really looking forward to HOME. I also really enjoyed 'Long Time Gone' but that is truly all I like on HOME. I was looking for more fun and upbeat songs that HOME just doesn't have. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent album, really top notch stuff, it just isn't what I am looking for out of the Dixie Chicks. I listened to it a few times and gave it away."
2,Huge Chick fan disappointed by the latest...,"In a word, this album is depressing. I loved the upbeat sound of their first two albums. I have every word memorized and sing along with each still. However, I don't think I'll be doing that with Home. I enjoy songs one and two and dislike everything else. Depressing."
2,For Serious Fans ONLY,"If you gotta have everything ever recorded by the Crows, andyou don't mind paying bucks for three songs, none not available elsewhere, then buddy, they saw you coming a mile away. But nothing here equals August & Everything or the hard to find Einstein on the Beach. Downhill since stardom?Some call it essential, others call it a ripoff. Maybe if it were packaged WITH #2, it might be worth it. But it's a yawner."
4,2 super songs and a fabulous live performance...,I recommande all people to buy this cd. My beautiful brother helped me to buy it. I 'm reconnaissant envers him
1,This thing sucks!,"DON'T BUY THIS MEMORY CARD! WHENEVER I SAVE DATA AND TRY AND ACCESS IT LATER ON, THE MEMORY CARD SAYS THAT I NEED TO FORMAT THE MEMORY CARD. IF I DO, THEN I LOSE MY MEMORY. IF I DONT, I CAN'T SAVE AND CAN'T ACCESS OLD MEMORY!"
2,Not what I expected from Julie Garwood,"Not that I didn't like the book, mind you, but it was Julie Garwood style. I have every book she wrote, and this one is more of a VC Andrews book. I love her funny (ADULT) HISTRICAL characters, and hope to see more of those in the future."
1,For teeny boppers,Not sure why this book was recommended if you like Jodi Picoult? This was written for young teenage girls. I think there should be a refund mechanism if you realize after 1 chapter that you don't want to read the rest.
4,"Pleasant,easy read","This is a pretty good book. It's nice and relaxing to read. I got hooked on it. How many of us have met girls almost exactly like Ann Logan? David was kind of gullible and indecisive,though, switching from Summer to Ann and back again. It showed what a mess lies can get you into . It was a little childish,but I enjoyed reading it. It related to my life. ""A Girl Named Summer"" would probably be best for girls ages 12-15."
1,Shocked I didn't like this,I have loved every Julie Garwood book I have read. Only read this one if you are around the age of 12.
1,Over rated product,"I purchased this item to replace a Terk antenna attached to a Yamaha receiver. This product did notheing to improve my reception over that I was getting from the Terk product. In addition it is poorly made. When trying to install, the copper lead wire snapped off requiring me to purchase a local replacement connector from Radio Shack. Save your money, this product just doesn't measure up to others comments."
5,It Just Works.,"I uncoiled it, draped it over one of my speakers, screwed it to my 75ohm antenna connection and it just worked. It didn't seem to matter which way it was oriented to get my signal strength meter to peg on all my local (15 miles) stations. I was so used to having all my signals fade away when I go close to my tuner, it was like I absorbed them as I got close. I nailed it in a corner of my ceiling molding in my downstairs den which placed it about 3 feet above the actual ground outside my house and extended the down lead to my tuner with RG6 coax, it's working just fine. All dipole FM antennas are not created equally. This one is truly outstanding."
5,Works where none has worked before,"I've purchased two different amplified indoor antennas. Neither did the job. This antenna works so much better. It's well built and super-easy to install and use. What's more, C. Crane is the name in AM and short wave radio reception, and this FM antenna lives up to their reputation. NPR sells it too, but buy it from Amazon and save a couple of bucks."
5,Where has this been all these years!,"The diffence this antenna made is unbelivable. Static-gone. Hissing-Gone. Interference due to people walking around-Gone.This antenna is worth every penny you pay for it, I would pay twice the price now that I know what a difference it makes."
1,Didn't improve my signal at all,"I purchased this antenna to improve my signal for a Sony HD FM radio I recently purchased. In particular, I was having troubles ""locking in"" a certain radio station here in Minneapolis using the standard antenna that came with my Sony radio. This C. Crane antenna did not help at all. I tried multiple configurations (horizontal, vertical, circles, half circles, etc., etc.). Actually, it provided WORSE reception (based on the signal bars on my radio) compared to the standard/free antenna that came with the radio. Further, its large size makes it challenging to hide. Seems other have had luck with this antenna... but certainly didn't seem to help in my case."
1,C.Crane support stinks!,"My antenna arrived and would not connect to the back of my radio because it has the wrong kind of connector. The trash I spoke with at C. Crane was not only incompetent, she was abrasive and offensive and ended up hanging up on me. I used to have a high opinion of C Crane but I guess that is all in the past. I may just return this antenna for a refund. I would NOT recommend ordering C Crane products based on their reputation as the current trash they have answering the phone is not how they got there. Considering C Crane? Keep on looking."
2,Disappointment,"This antenna is touted as the best indoor FM antenna. Well, it has failed to prove that claim at my house. I've tried several configurations with my receiver as per instructions and unfortunately there has been negligible reception improvement over the supplied FM antenna wire. Waste of money for me, although I hope others have more favorable results."
1,No better than the free dipole that comes with your tuner,"Although in nice packaging, and high quality connections, this antenna actually received worse than the factory supplied dipole that came with my receptor HD. I had trouble receiving even high power stations with the c-crane antenna. I returned it the same day and went back to my regular dipole."
3,Sturdy material,"This is a heavy duty antenna. Unfortunately, it did not help reception in my situation for the one favorite local radio station that keeps dropping in/out. I tried every possible configuration imaginable to eliminate the dropping. I don't really have the option to relocate the TV/components. Not being a techy, it amazes that my new expensive receiver has these challenges while a $10 radio receives the signal just fine. I decided to keep it just because of it's sturdiness."
1,Cheaper antennas will do the same job.,"I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed with the performance I had planned to use it with my new sangean tuner but after comparing it with the antenna that comes with the tuner I could not justify the money I spent I tried to place the C-crane in several locations arund the house but the reception was poor so I ended up using the antenna that comes with the tuneralso the C-crane reflect is very difficult to put up anywhere it is not flexible, I was not happy or satisfied."
2,Not worth the time,"220 pages of people sitting around cussing and complaining. The main redeaming factor of the book is that it is short, and written at a 4th grade level; so you can get through it quickly. I would not recommend the book to a friend, and regret the time I wasted reading it.In some ways, the book gives an more accurate picture of the criminal mind than most thrillers. The bad guys are ordinary people, living their lives, dealing with problems. They spend a great deal of time whining and complaining. The cops often have a good notion in advance about who is doing wrong. But also spend a great deal of their time engaged in bathroom banter.The work fits somewhere between a dumb criminals web page and a second rate fiction novel. There are better books out there."
2,don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your money and get confused. When compared it with the Sybex's version, you'll find out unbelievable similarities. Except that the other book is more organized and rational. For the same money, you may find out other option with much more valuable details."
3,An Okay CD... Not What Expected,I bought this CD to use with my middle school cheerleaders... I didn't realize it was the same 5 songs just mixed 3 different ways. I was hoping for more options.... I ended up not using the CD for their routine because the songs were either way to fast for the middle school level or way to slow.
5,The book is a chilling reflection of the human soul.,"Every time I took a breather from the book, I'd wonder how so much evil was contained in its pages. Everytime I thought this was the worst it could get, Lewis upped the ante, til there was no turning back. Amazing book, sweet dreams."
3,A maddening slip-up by Oxford University Press,"Like ""Casting The Runes"" in this same series of Oxford World's Classics, this edition is liberally sprinkled with asterisks to indicate explanatory footnotes -- but the footnotes aren't included.I imagine this is because Lewis's text is copyright-free, but not the editorial work to which those asterisks once alluded. To excise helpful editorial material is disappointing enough, but to leave those asterisks -- in this age of global search-and-replace -- is astonishing sloppiness from the esteemed OUP.Do please note that I refer to the out-of-print 2002 hardcover edition. I post this review for anyone who collects, as I do, the original hardcover Oxford World's Classics (6"" x 4"") and is adding the recent hardcover reissues to his collection."
5,Better then Lexmark x83/x73,I've had my Hp 750 since Jan. 2002 and I think it is one of the best All in one machines out there for the price. I also have a Lexmark X73 and the print quality of the Hp750 is a lot better than the X73. It is worth the extra ... bucks. The Hp also prints and scans faster the the Lexmark.
2,OK for the price,"I have never been able to achieve the prints per page suggested by HP. I am currently printing a pdf form that I started over an hour ago. The form is 5 pages long and I am waiting on page 4 to print out. The scanner software is OK, but you need to upgrade if you use the scanner regularly. If you want just a scanner to have on hand, this is OK. The one function that is handy, is the copier function. It is faster than the printer, but that isn't saying much. The fourth page just popped out, one hour and twenty one minutes after starting.I would suggest spending more money for a newer product."
1,Printer is great - scanner/copier horrible,"I've always owned HP printers and bought this pcs 2 years ago. The printer works great. After the first 4 months the copier & scanner started giving me problems. My father bought shortly after I did - he had the same problems. I think HP needs help with their scanner/copier function. According to HP, we got a fluke - funny - the two were bought at different places, at different times, but with the same problem??? My new one is a Canon!! The HP went in the trash!!"
2,Re-run of Heritage Foundation's greatest hits,"Though I agree with most of Limbaugh's views, I found the book dull and repetitive. This book basically recycles the Inside-the-Beltway right wing party line--one part Kemp, one part Bennett, one part Heritage Foundation, one part Cato Insititute and one part neo-conservative. The sad thing is that the party line of Limbaugh and Company hasn't changed in almost twenty years. When Buchanan offered a variation on the party line, Limbaugh and Company went nuts. Though the Left went off the deep end long ago, the current leadership on the Right(and Limbaugh considers himself to be one of the Right's leaders) is stagnant, adrift in a world where they are hardly relevant. This book is symbolic of the sterility of the establishment Right of today. Liberals must be licking their chops."
5,this boook is veri goood,i reely liked this boook becas it was ritten for smert peeple like me. now i nowe that stiroefoam is biodegradebal and i lost mie job becas of meksicans and stuff. i reelize now that i most take viloent acshion! i will goe buy a gun now.
1,Do the Crime! Pay the Time!,"Talk about sapheaded nonsense. Dredging in the everything from the Kennedy family to Roosevelt's dog does not change what has happened here.The great Conservative icon, who slept in the Lincoln bedroom, is a big, fat, idiotic, drug-addled criminal.Go to jail. NO whining."
1,This book is a Rush!,The master of the oxymoron strikes again!Remember: The right wing tells lies. The wing right wants to take your money so they can buy drugs. Ignore them!
1,I was in pain till I found this book,"Yes, in pain. Liberals disagreeing with me, and Clinton messing everything up. But this book hit me like a really big, long term dose of illegally purchased Oxycontin. I mean, now I can insist on stiff drug penalties for others while feeling no pain whatsover! Some people think pain relief like this book delivers must have side effects--loss of hearing, weight loss, muddled thinking, a tendency to rant--but not me!This book gives ""rush"" a whole new meaning! It also gives the phrase ""feeling no pain"" a new meaning. Also the phrase ""drug addled hypocrite."""
1,What?!?! How can an educated person respect this propaganda,"Look, everyone has an opinion on the bickering inefficiencies that is United States politics but reading drivell like this is simply making things worse. If you want criticism from the right read something that actually has cited sources and is peer reviewed not an incoherent rambling set of speeches that some dumb redneck paid to have vanity published, damn."
5,Rush is (still) right!,"In 1993, Rush Limbaugh followed his bestselling masterpiece ""The Way Things Ought To Be"" with ""See, I Told You So."" Both of these books helped set the tone for the Gingrich revolution of the 1994 election when the GOP took control of both the House and the Senate. SITYS was written at the beginning of Bill Clinton's first term as President, and Rush almost seems to predict to a ""T"" how Clinton's presidency would unfold, as the disgraceful stain on our country's history that it truly would turn out to be. Limbaugh takes on so-called ""New Democrats"" (Leftist radicals disguised as moderates), Hillary Clinton's socialist health care scheme, the political correctness thought police and the revisionists and their efforts to rewrite history. SITYS is at least as good a read as TWTOTB, if not better. In this age of the war on terrorism, I would love to see Limbaugh come out with a third book. Well, how about it, Rush?"
5,Lovely and Easy! You'll feel like a Pro!,"Trust me. I have absolutely no artistic ability but this book was inspirational and fun to use. Lovely illustrations, very easy instructions. Fungi and small birds as well!"
4,Pretty darn good!!!,"As with all penguin cafe albums, the listening is easy! Some arrangements of tracks compared to those on other albums are a little dissapointing but still worth listening to. Still some spine-tingling moments to play, replay, and replay again!"
2,So far I am not impressed,"I have had bad luck with the program so far,when I install a driveway or road on my design the program crashes.It is very difficult to contact the manufacturer for assistance I have e mailed them twice with my problem and have not heard back from them except for them confirming receiving my e mail.This program is tough to get use to but if I ever get the silly thing to work,I think it will be worth the money with the rebate."
5,Way better than traditional liquids and powders,"I was skeptical at first. But when you have a baby in one arm and are trying to put some soap in the dishwasher, plopping a clean packet into the soap containment unit is 100 times easier. No messy hands. No spilling. No crusty powder leftover unmelted. These things rock.You may think they cost more, but if you factor in the 2-in-1 action and the mess factor, totally worth it.This convenient size last me almost a year. I dislike dragging back big loads of detergents from the store. Amazon delivers again with quickness.Will never go back again to regular dishwashing soaps. These packs dissolve 100% of the time so no worries about that. It's kind of like rice candy wrappers. Totally gone. 100%. Great stuff."
4,"I loved the feeder, my goldfinches didn't",I'm sorry but my goldfinches couldn't find the holes. They just stood up & smacked the side wall looking for the hole. I gave it to a friend & hers figured it out fine. I bought a little 'sock feeder' & my gold finches are happy now. I gave it over 2 months try & they just looked at it funny. I recommend this if you have above average goldfinches.
4,It works,"I received trap and was surprised at the size (I thought it would be bigger). It has worked quite well. I've trapped 2 baby bunnies, 6 baby opossums, 2 adult rabbits, and 1 squirrel. I bought it trap the rabbits, didn't even know that I had opossums. I take them to a park and let them go.The only complaint that I have is that the door broke after the 3rd catch. However, I was able to wire it back on. It doesn't work as smoothly as it did at first."
1,Lower rating for NO INCLUDED INSTRUCTIONS,"After contact with the manufacturer and receiving additional helpful instruction, my rating goes from 1 star to three stars. (When I received these traps there were absolutely NO INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED with the cages ABOUT ANYTHING: HOW TO OPEN AND SET THE TRAP WITH BAIT? WHAT KIND OF BAIT? HOW TO REMOVE THE SQUIRREL, IF CAUGHT?) THE TRAP CANNOT BE USED WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, and I hope that they are standard inserts now."
1,price reflects quality,"Trying to remove squirrels vice killing. Went the cheap route with this trap and yes the price reflects the quality. Terrible customer service, but eventually did process return. Don't buy cheap trap."
1,"I Struggled, I Really Did . . .",". . . but I couldn't make it past chapter three. I loved the first three Callahan's books, but this one seemed self-indulgent and flabby. I felt like every sentence of the first three chapters had at least two self-congratulatory puns, which inevitably forced Robinson to digress from anything resembling plot or character.Reading this book (or the first three chapters) was like being trapped in the bar at a science fiction convention, listening to a bunch of people try to achieve alpha-male status by demonstrating their skill with puns, interrupted by the occasional filk-song."
5,Great vest..,"This is a very nice vest.Its warm, soft & very comfortable.Sizing perfect. Love it. I would recommendthis product to anyone looking for extra warmth,,"
4,"Great price, great quality.","I really don't understand the negative reviews, this lens is an ideal all round lens, it isn't expensive and its great quality for the price, it isn't amazing but the quality is ideal for me, I am intern photographer, and a photography student, its a Canon lens and Canon don't make bad equipment, I use this lens for an everyday lens, its great if I'm looking for something thats simlar to what the eye sees. I use a wide-angle, a macro, and a telephoto for my other needs and this is a great in-between lens for when I don't want the extremes of an angle. For a great all round reliable brand name lens at a great price, this is the lens for you!!"
3,Classic Horse Jumping! Enjoyable love story for all ages...,"I enjoyed this movie because you could feel the struggles that each character had to face. The problems where very simiular for most of the characters. When the young girls rent ""Titantic"" they love the story and will love the struggles of two people fighting to find love in this movie also."
2,Not what I expected from Melissa Gilbert,"This is probably a good story, but we didn't finish watching it because of all the cursing and foul language. It's so sad that it seems this is expected in making movies, even those that have a good story."
5,Really cool stuff.,"I really dig the original works, but it's nice to hear a fresh take on some really solid music. Well done."
2,If You're Looking for a Modern Book - This Isn't For You,"The book contains good information, but it was written back in 1920-something. The wording is therefore somewhat florid, over-the-top and full of scientific terms no longer inuse today. If I were a student of plating history, this would be a fine addition to my library. Unfortunately, I was looking for something more up to date."
2,Arrived Damaged,"Looks good and went together fairly easily without help, however as I out it together on Christmas eve, I did not notice the shipping damage and it was until the next morning that the kids went out to see the basketball goal that we noticed it was leaking and on further inspection the corner was damaged. It is what it is, but to late to return, so really not that happy with it. Have filled it with a couple hundred LBS of sand, which will make it a real pain to move, if we ever want to move it..."
5,Dance Queen,"I loved Roselyn Sachez for her acting in ""Without A Trace"". So when I heard that she was the main star in this movie, I just had to see it. She is so incredible in this movie. Her dancing is so sexy and inspiring. I could watch her dance and never get bored."
2,Yellow,"The title of this film should be ""I Am the Great and Marvelous Roselyn Sánchez"". A self engrandizing film with a weak plot and terrible acting, I would save my money unless you are an all-out fan of Roselyn's. If that is the case, buy it, and you will see her in all of her glory. Most telenovelas are masterworks when compared to this melodramatic piece, which perhaps will turn you ""yellow"" from sheer distress."
3,Shipping took a long time,"The condition of the book is great, however, shipping took so long--almost a month! I ordered it well in advance, as I live out of the country, and a family member was going to bring it down with her."
4,Make the most of your creativity,"Most articles about the menstral cycle focus only the more negative aspects of any associated mood changes - such as irritability, weepiness, bingeing etc...This book covers all of these plus many of positive aspects (such as creativity) that are driven by hormone changes through-out the cycle. Better still it tells you exactly which days of the month you can expect to get that creative urge so that you can plan for & make the most of these days. Of course this book won't work quite as well for you if you don't have a standard 28 day cycle - however just knowing which positive aspects are associated with, say, that rise in progesterone should enable you to chart your own cycle."
4,its misssing something!,"ok, did any one else notice that in the credits there was 2 songs. and they managed to put the second one on the soundtrack. but not the actual pirate song? dont get me wrong, the soundtrack is brilliant. but i wanted that song on there"
5,Great music,"An album that has both Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer is guarenteed to be powerful and driving. Pirates is both.It is also incredibly lush and well worth the price. The soundtrack has been eagerly anticipated since I had to go to two bookstores to locate it, and spotted disappointed buyers at the first place -- which didn't have it.Not to be missed are the credits inside with ""Music composed by Klaus ""Bowsprit"" Badelt; Score overproduced by Hans ""Long John"" Zimmer.""Along with The Time Machine and Gladiator, I think Pirates will be one of my favorites."
4,Hans Zimmer Derivative of Himself,"Clearly Hans Zimmer was heavily influenced by the Planet compositions of Gustav Holst, but his Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack was also heavily influenced by another composition. One of his own. And I do not mean Gladiator. While you can tell that Gladiator is a Zimmer project, it doesn't that closely resemble POTC. At least not as much as Crimson Tide. If Zimmer was self-derivative it was of his score for the 1995 submarine movie. In fact, you don't have to listen too closely to a side by side comparison of the two to hear HUGE similarities. The entire main theme of the score for POTC and Tide are almost identitical. I am sure I am not the only one to notice this. I do not mean to take anything away from his most recent creation, but Zimmer (or his seeming nom du plume, Badelt) is getting quite repetitious."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"This film is by far... oh sooooo much by far the best film of the year - UN-BE-LEE-VA-BLE! If you haven't seen it, then OH ylou better get out there and watch it - Its funny, action packed and just totally wicked! Orlando Bloom was buff but I dont think anyone could beat Johnny Depp - He cracked me up big tym - He was hilarious and also totally scrummy!Not sure about the CD - Haven't got it but I will have it soon! I'm sure it will be great as it is from the film :-P"
5,JUST amazing,this cd is so awesome i love the main theme!!! Klaus badelt is so cool!!!! Just like the movie this is the best soundtrack this summer and the movie like i said is the best movie this summer it might even be the best movie this year!!!
4,Great music with one But...,"The music is well composed and full of excitment. The main theme is played through out the entire CD. While the theme captures the imagination there is not a lot of varity between the little bit of different music that there actually is, just variations of the theme. I am just saddened about the repetfullness, but other is wise a wonderful score."
4,a disappointed mom,"I bought this cd because it was requested by my daughter's orchestra director. However, I am quite disappointed about the contents. Just like other movie sound tract, it is long and boring."
3,Slow it down,"The music sounded beautiful-for the most part. It did too sound rushed, which lessened the quality of the songs. I can't recall seeing the movie and remembering the music being that fast...or at least it didn't seem like it. Alls I have to say is, pretty good, would have been better if it were a bit slower."
4,"Badelt Swashes an Able Buckle for ""Pirates""","Young Klaus Badelt now has several well received film scores under his belt, but his music for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" will undoubtedly make him well known. This score is a cut below several classics, Alfred Newman-""The Black Swan,"" and Erich Wolfgang Korngold-""Captain Blood"" and ""The Sea Hawk,"" but still works quite well in the film and on the soundtrack album. It is something of a contemporary reinterpretaion of the swashbuckler genre with an homage or two to earlier works. There are passages that do bring Korngold to mind. It must be noted that Badelt was brought to the project rather late (Alan Silvestri was originally advertised as the composer)and it is clear that Hans Zimmer was on board to give a hand. Still, Badelt creates a very workable musical backdrop for the film and a score that is a good deal of fun as a soundtrack album which is nicely packaged and well produced by Disney."
3,Advertised as 8 cup - is only 4 cup,"I received my coffee press today and was disappointed to find that while Amazon.com has it titled ""8-cup"" it is only a 4 cup. I definitely wouldn't have paid this price for a 4 cup."
4,Affordable choice for a portable hoop,"This took about three hours for a reasonably competent male to put together. The instructions are better than many I have dealt with, but there are confusing parts. The hardest part was the spring mechanism. Unless you have good upper body strength it will take two people to assemble.The hoop is affordable at around 200 bucks and is generally sturdy. There is a bit of wobble. All in all, a good hoop for younger players. Changing heights is really easy. The backboard size is large for hoops in this price range."
1,99 Pages of Phoniness,Laura Albert's latest scam for all the gullible fools. A middle-aged loser of a woman with a hard hustle who found an angle to work pretty much says it all. Buyers beware!
1,Writer with moral equivelant of a slug.... No offense slug.,I read these so-called J.T. LeRoy novels few months ago before the New York Times published the truth about this phony writer (a house wife named Laura Albert) who capitalized on the subject of child abuse. I didn't really think much of the writing before and I think even less of it now. What a disappointing excuse for a human being! This truly deserves public condemnation.
5,An Innovative and Astounding Achievement,"Ms. Kirshenbaum has demonstrated incredible creativity in designing, writing and printing this book. The pages are magnificently picturesque and stimulating, some even are visual overwhelming. I can't imagine the time, skill and effort expended to create this artwork.The book is an example and a story about the history of writing and communication. Ms. Kirshenbaum offers a plethora of stories and quotes regarding subjects related to both topics. She also shares her own experiences of the frustrations and rewards of teaching children.This is a book that people with interest in art or graphic design would really cherish and appreciate. I think teachers might also be inspired by the ideas presented in it."
5,Bible Stories for Thinking Teens,"When I was 12 and in my confirmation class, I was given this book. I loved the stories. What I most liked was the way the Bible was explained. For example, there are different creation stories in Genesis. This book explained why there was a difference. The book provides a good retelling of the stories along with some explanation and background. It is a marvelous resource for today's youth.When a friend was looking for a book of Bible stories for their grandchild, I remembered this book. I was so glad to see that I could still get a copy. I just wish that it was still in print today."
4,covers all the obvious points . . .,"described in the editorial reviews, which means it is a pretty good read for someone who is not very knowledgeable but is probably less useful for readers more familiar with Reform.One thing that I liked: Kaplan's willingness to note that some of the Reform movement's current problems are identical to those that Reform rabbis were complaining about as early as the 1880s; evidently, there is something about liberal religion that leads to a large but apathetic membership.One thing that I wish Kaplan had put in: more primary source material - perhaps in the form of an appendix with the text of the Reform platforms, etc. that Kaplan writes about."
5,"Touching, funny, and wise","Filmed at Heritage House, a sprawling Bed & Breakfast on California's Mendocino Coast, Same Time Next year features Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn as an adulterous couple who, over a quarter of a century, meet annually for a weekend at the same hideaway. Besides spanning the lives of this couple, who are each married-with-family, the film also spans some of the most convulsive, tumultuous, and confusing years of the country's history.Beautiful, tasteful, and worth watching again and again."
1,Yet More Abberant Human Behaviour Glorified By Hollywood!,"It seems to me like somehow Hollywood manages to glorify nearly every Abberant Human Condition such as Alcoholism (Barfly, Cocktail), Drug Abuse (Blow) and a host of other subjects. This movie glorifies Adultery as Alan Alda and Ellen Who Is Not Burstin' With Anything spend one weekend a year having sex with each other. One has to begin to wonder just how much these two need each other as they seem to manage quite well apart for the other 363 days of the year. This is a pitiful and very tedious and sad excuse for a movie"
4,"Heritage House, Mendocino","I bought this video to view before we visited the inn where it all happens: Heritage House in Mendocino, CA. As we drove up the coast, we talked about the movie, the moral issues, the actors, and it gave us so much to talk about, we almost missed the view of the Pacific! Just a little dated, but Alan Alda is so magnificent in this that you can putaside your critic's pen and just enjoy. His performance should have brought him an Oscar."
5,Well-constructed romantic play,"This is taken from a Noel-Coward like play about a married and a married woman who meet every year for a weekend for adultery. Like Brief Encounter, the couple seems both innocent and guilty about their affair. Unlike that play, however, the encounter is repeated annually for years and the relationship is more physical. There is some good age make-up, although Ellen Burstyn doesn't convince when she's at her youngest. The action does seem rather obviously adapted from a play, with scenes of the outside tacked on but redundant, and I feel it would be better to have just acknowledged the story's origins by keeping the action in the interior location. The music by Marvin Hamlisch is one of his best, and is used sparingly throughout the film."
2,CHEEEEESE!!!!,"It was only a couple of dollars to buy, so I did... That is all I really have to say about it.... LOL"
2,My Princesses are disappointed....,"Overall I think this game is O.K. My 4 year-old daughters LOVE princesses & like this game. The only problem - the DVD does NOT shuffle, so we go thru the same questions over & over & over & over!! The 4-year-old attention span, or really the amount of time it takes for one of them to win - having the SAME questions - really does not make for an exciting game. We have several other SceneIt games, and NONE of them have a shuffle issue. It says on the box that the DVD may not shuffle with all DVD players - I really wonder if it shuffles at all, and it is a design flaw. Again, we have several other SceneIt games & this has never been a problem before."
3,could have been better,"I bought this game for my four year old neice for Christmas. The questions were very repetitive, and the adults sitting around were quickly bored and thought it was a pretty lame game. For my overstimulated and tired nieces however, sitting in front of the TV and answering the questions was very enjoyable and they liked it. I don't know about the long term entertainment value however."
1,Won't run on either of my machines,I have tried this program on two very fast machines that should run ANYTHING...on one it will not run at all. On the other it runs so poorly that its not worth playing. The intro hangs on a black screen. If you can get past that it won't let you enter your name...so you decide to play without a name and then you can't pick stocks. Its a mess. I got an email about the first problem from the manufacturer. As I remeber it had something to do with confirming my processor type.In short...getting it to run right was just too much trouble and now it just sits on a shelf. I wish I would have sent it back right after I got it.
3,"""Do not expect much.""","Page seven. The introduction. ""...I must warn the reader not to expect much from this book."" I count the book as a nice addition to my library but more for historical purposes. Page 62: ""The trouble with harnesses is that they are a bother and are superfluous most of the time."" Same page: ""The problem with helmets is they are a bother."" The book provides a bit of insight in to the world of climbing before Black Diamond and Petzl. The photos are full of homemade gear and climbing with laid rope. For technical content go with ""The Freedom of the Hills"" by the mountaineers. This book, once again, is more for historical reference in this day and age."
3,too small,"The cat loves to play with them in the box, but they get out of the holes too easily. If they were just a little bigger, he could bat them around without them shooting out of the box!"
1,Be very very careful!,"I wish I would have read all these reviews before giving these to my cat to play with. My cat also chewed on one of these balls and I spent over $3000 in emergency surgery to remove bits of ball from her intestine. If your cat chews on things, they will chew the ball apart, it crumbles in their mouth! I would not recommend these to anyone!"
4,Hot music by a hot male (and female),"I love this album!! It has so many good songs to snuggle to and to just remember the good times to. When they perform together on this album, you will be ready for love. (Besides, he is such a hunk!)"
2,Maybe I'm not doing it right,"I had been making baguette for a while using just a pizza stone and cornmeal, and I wanted nice round ones, so I bought this.With parchment paper, this made fine baguettes. However, after a few uses, and a couple of washes (and drys), it rusted all to hell. I used it for a while anyway, with parchment paper between it and the bread, but the smell of rust really ruined what are otherwise terrific baguettes.It's possible I missed some instruction specifying that it should never come in contact with water, in which case this is totally my bad, but I'd kinda prefer a pan I can wash.Also, this pan is a touch too long for my tiny oven. Not a problem for people with modern ovens, but just something to keep in mind. I always had to bake on a diagonal."
4,My 3yo loves this cookbook,"My 3.5 year old loves to eat and loves to cook. She had another small cookbook with mostly desserts, so I wanted to get her one with healthy meals. Also, our home is vegetarian. I was a little skeptical when I first looked at this book, thinking the food didn't seem too exciting. But for a small child, it seems perfect--they are simple recipes, and the results are simple, but they are things she can really understand and do a lot of herself. The step by step pictures are perfect, and she takes this book out almost every day. I'm planning to get her the other book by Katzen."
4,Fun recipes for kids,My very picky eater loved making the salad people from this book. There are several other fun recipes that we are looking forward to trying.
3,I like the Chieftans but they have made better productions,I have not listened to this for a long time. This in itself tells me that it is not a fave.
3,"Does the job, but definitely has some design flaws","We bought this seat to use when we travel or go somewhere without a highchair (trying to feed our son in a hotel room was a nightmare without a booster seat!). It is fairly compact & easy to stash in the car for a trip. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the tray is a bit of a tight fit. My son isn't even one yet & it's almost pushing against his tummy. Also, the mechanism to retract the straps is underneath the seat, making it very difficult to reach and twist once the seat is on a chair. We keep the booster seat set up at our table so we can pop our son into it for a snack or when he refuses to eat in his high chair. He usually uses it without the tray at home & just eats off the table. A decent seat for the price, but could use some design improvements."
2,"Not for every day use! ""Tray"" is a big waste!","I have been using this booster seat for a while now and it is nothing but a pain to me. the tray that came with it went in the closet the first day we bought the booster seat and we have never used it. (My slender son would not fit in the seat with the tray attached.) For a while, the seat worked well. I guess it still ""works"" well, but it is the most pain in the rear thing to clean. There are way too many cracks and crevases to possibly keep it clean. And the retractable belts are a great idea, but in my opinion are just a breeding ground for bacteria and other things from the impossibility to keep it clean.If you were to use this as an occasional on-the-go seat, I would probably recommend it, but don't buy this seat if you plan on using it daily as your primary booster seat!"
4,love almost everything about it,"I love this portable highchair. It folds up so easy and is perfect when we are at a friends house having dinner. It was almost impossible to feed my 13 month old daughter while out, because she would not sit still. Ever since I got this it has been a piece of cake. The only problem I have with it is that the tray is starting to hit her tummy, it's not adjustable. This would be perfect it it was adjustable. But I denfinatly don't have any other complaints."
2,Tray pops off too easily,"Liked how compact this was, and how easy it was to assemble. However, within the first fifteen minutes of using it, my 13 month old had kicked off the tray. I am now looking for something better..."
2,Great options but my 13 month old is too big for it!,"I originally purchased this at Babies R Us without my daughter. I loved the retractable belts and that it folds up for travel. I was very excited to start using it at home. My daughter was going to sit at the table like a big girl! I however was disappointed that with the tray on, my daughter's belly was squished. My daughter is a little big for her age with a nice healthy round baby belly, but the box said up to 4 years old and she is no where near that size. WIthout the tray she fits nicely, but we really wanted a booster with a tray.My suggestion would be to read the reviews online and then take your child with you to the store. When I returned this booster, I put my daughter in the other boosters to see which one would work best. Good advidce for any baby purchases! :)"
3,Booster Seat,"I have been impressed with the safety of this seat. However, I am displeased with the tray. It is small and too flat to keep my 12 mos. old from easily dropping food off the sides. She can also easily push it off with a quick touch of her foot. The design for the tray to stay on is horrible - so don't plan on using this as a replacement for a high chair. If you are planning on using it for a booster seat alone it is great!"
5,Love it!,"I just had to respond because I noticed one reviewer hated it because the tray came off too easy and one hated it because it was too hard to get off. Too funny.Anyway, we don't use it for travel, we use it for everyday use. We have twins who will be three in a few weeks and have been using this for close to a year now. We just keep it strapped to the kitchen chairs. I don't know the tray is even needed. With it on the chair, you can just pull it up to the table. We have never had any problem with the straps coming loose, and whoever does have this problem, probably just doesn't have them threaded properly.As far as tyhe tray is concerned, we do use the tray occasionally. We have never had any problems being able to get it off and never had problems with our girls getting it off. (If your kids can get it off and makes a mess... control your kid!;)For $20 it has been one of the cheapest and most used baby products we've owned."
1,Not worth it,"During the holidays we traveled a lot. Also while in work my daughter is at my parents house, it is a small house, so I didn't want to have to leave a highchair there. So I thought this would be a great thing to feed her on. What a pain. The tray doesn't stay on, so while you're trying to feed the baby you also have to try & keep the tray on. I gave up and stopped using it, it's not worth the hassle."
1,Not Worth the $$,"I have a high chair at my house but my 6 month old spends a long at grandma's house. I didn't want to spend too much money for another highchair so I thought this would work perfect, not expensive and I would be able to take it anywhere. Sorry to say that is not so. This product could not hold my baby from falling over to the sides and it would slide off the chair. But I guess you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this product unless you have a baby that can sit very still and not move an inch."
3,"okay, but lacking","We bought this to replace a booster we were very happy with for eight years. ( The straps were lost between 2nd and 3rd child).We couldn't find the same one so we tried this one. We found that the tray is a pain to take on and off and only has one position. Our averaged sized 16mo old's belly is close to getting squished! It won't fit much longer and we hoped to use the tray for at least a year. Our old one had 2 tray positions and it fit until they were nearly three. They enjoyed using they tray for coloring, etc. and was useful when we needed extra room at the table. We have decided to return this one and look for replacement straps for our old one. Guess they don't make them like they used to!"
2,A mistake to purchase,"I bought this seat for my 11 month old daughter yesterday and returned it this morning. The tray is too small and the seat can't be taken apart to be cleaned. Both are important features to me. After trying several in the store, something I should have done in the first palce, I chose the Safety First seat with the swing out tray. The tray had 2 adjustments and fit around my daughter nicely. The seat can be taken apart to be cleaned, as well as the straps. I paid the same amount for my new seat as I did for the fold n go."
1,Completely Disappointed,"My husband and I bought this booster seat because it seemed covenient for home and travel. However, in testing it out, we found many flaws. Our oldest son is almost two and is too big for it already (even though it says ages 6mos to 4yrs), especially with the tray on. The straps that secure the booster seat onto the chair do not lock in place. After a while of my son moving around in the seat, the straps became loose and the seat was falling off the chair. We were very unhappy with this product and will be returning it for the 4 in 1 seat."
1,Faulty Video,"I bought this dvd a while ago and only had time in the past couple of weeks to get to it. I was disappointed- The DVD was not in sync at all. It looks like it would be informative, but the language comes 20 seconds after the movement. I find it useless since it doesn't line up.It may be I just happened to get a defective product, but this was one of the three dvds I bought. One I got bored with quickly, the other one a friend is borrowing."
5,Hewlett Packard Office Jet v4040xi All In One,"I just purchased the H/P offfice jet v40 printer and to begin with,I'm amazed at the color quality of the photos that are scanned ....it looks like the original photos. It produces professional-like photo images on regular paper. The officejet V40 does everything well, print, copy, scan and faxes. The print color copies are natural and crisp looking. It's not the fastest printer for BIG jobs, but for home office and creative ideals you can't beat it. I really like it ! ! ! I gave it five stars *****Kenneth BartleyLaplace La."
5,the best Mac magazine,It's the most popular magazine at Apple and its reviews are less biased than Macworld's. Macworld has sadly deteriorated into an advertising rag.
1,MacLife,"Possibly a good magazine for geeks but not for this amateur. Way too technical for me. I finished my first copy in about five minutes. One item in the ""ask"" section is about the only part I understood."
2,Not Much To It,"I've been getting this magazine and a couple of others for years now, how disappointing this one is with the lack of stories, informationd something useful. Its all reviews and ads. I finished the magazine in less than 5 min. Once my subscription runs out, won't renew."
1,haven't received subscription yet,How do am I supposed to rate this? I haven't received this subscription yet.
5,Great Item,"This works really well. I never have to staple more than a few pages. I've actually been using it as my primary stapler, since my real stapler got lost during a recent move. One tip is that the ""button"" on the top needs to be in the more central position in order for it to work. I just keep it in this position (it doesn't close) but it's easier than forcing the button up/down each time I need to use it."
2,Stablemates Size,"The product description does not state that this set is Stablemates size. I could have guessed by looking at the product dimensions, but it didn't occur to me. The set itself is fine as long as you know what you are receiving."
5,Lois & Clark do it again,"Season 3 was great =) I loved this show when it was on TV, I like it even more now.I recomend it for any Superman fan, even though it is a romantic comedy, I laugh nowat the cheasy romance, but if you can get over that you'll enjoy this season as much asSeason's 1 and 2. Also you must buy season 4 to complete the set =) (Mine is on pre-order)"
1,I would've choosen O stars,"This publication does not even deserve one star. One star is too generous. The publication has an attractive title. This causes wishful thinkers such as myself to purchase it hoping that somehow we will find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow despite the fact that others have given it horrible reviews. ...SAVE YOUR MONEY. DONT BUY THIS BOOK.This newsprint publication (not really a book) is full of advertisements for all sorts of services geared toward the individual who wants to get rich quick or get paid big to do very little, with very little info on the business of dropshipping."
2,Re-records are never the best.,"With the exception of ""Crying"", every cut on this CD is a re-record. This is an acceptable CD if you are a Narvel collector and must own everything he ever recorded. I have been a Narvel fan since 1957. I still have, in mint condition, my original copy of the Mercury 45rpm single of ""Kiss-A-Me Baby"", along with more than 60 other Narvel singles, LP's and CD's. If you are familiar with only two or three Narvel hits and would like to hear more, then DO NOT buy this. Bear Family has two Narvel compilations in which to invest your money that will give you the true Narvel Felts. If you like the Bear Family original recordings then still more original Narvel is available from Amazon.com. Re-records are never the best way to listen to the body of work of any performer. Narvel Felts' hits deserve to be heard the way they were first recorded, the reason they became hits."
3,Miriam Over the Top,"Interesting film, but not one of Bette's best. Miriam Hopkins (much better acting in ""These Three"" and ""The Heiress"") eats the scenery every time. Miriam is poorly cast as 20 something, but looks about 50 years old at the beginning of film. Outstanding is Vincent Sherman, the director's interview on the DVD--great insight into the making of the film and personalities of Mim and Bette."
4,excellent book,"Although this book is somewhat older, the choice of authors was fantastic. The coverage on topics such as speech audiometry and immittance still far exceeds that found in newer texts."
3,Short early musical feature plus two shorts,"""Howdy Broadway"" is an interesting early poverty row musical. Primitive filming and amateur acting make it a fun view. The print on the DVD runs 47 minutesand seems to be complete. Some sources indicate the original release was 70 minutes, but nothing appears to be missing.The two shorts are enjoyable. A young Betty Grable sparks one, while Milton Berle chews the scenery in the other.All in all, a good package for the price. Prints are a little worn, but overall sound and picture quality is acceptable."
4,Very Inspirational!,"This is a terrific book to have on hand if one is looking for style and decorating ideas. There's not much in the way of actual how-to's, but a wonderful source to page through for all of those idea-starters. A surprising variety of decor and styles are represented."
1,"Bad Experience, not a good buy","I have the V40 2 months now. It's been giving me problem in receiving fax from selective people.Problem:1. Can't receive fax (I connected it with a normal phone line.)2. Take longer to set it up3. The setup menu is a joke (what a shame! HP is a great name for many products that I have used in the past. Wake up HP!!)4. Customer service is not a call told free number and is not 24 X 75. I send them an email describing my problem and what I got in return is a 13 pages documents without clear instructions.6. I called Staple and they said that since I did not buy an extra warranty from them, they can help. Next time I will buy it from Best Buy where the service is friendlier7. For some reason, I can received junk fax.Can anyone give me help? Can I return it to HP?Thank you"
4,better then I thought,"I thought I couldn't go wrong with this product for only [$$$'s], but it's better then I expected. Since it isn't a flatbed scanner, you have to send single pages through (can't copy a page from a book). Besides that, the color copying and printing looks great, and all the fax functions are working fine.I have Windows 2000, and my computer crashed (blue screen) half way through set-up. I rebooted, uninstalled / reinstalled the software, and now everything works great.I still don't see anything on the market at this price that beats it."
4,abc mews classics assassination of president kennedy,i thought this was a very good fascinating dvd on president kennedys murder.i didn t give it a 5 star rating because i felt the dvd was to short. i felt there should have been another hour on the dvd. there isnt any footage of oswald on the dvd. there is plenty of oswald footage available. especialy the oswald midnight news conferance footage. which was taken from several directions. other than that a very good dvd.
2,"Grainy, poor quality","I tried to use this video for a high school government class. The quality was poor, grainy. The video was all over the place, could not keep a student's atention."
1,All the reviews are 100% dead on!,I am so glad that I read the reviews before buying this game! I rented it and I don't understand how EA could have ruined such a great franchise! Don't even bother unless you want to be dissapionted.
2,Waste of Money,"The cooking surface of this pan is closer to 5"" than 8"". The first time I used the pan was to fry eggs. Since the pan was new I sprayed it with cooking spray and then fried the eggs in butter. Despite my precaution the butter stained the sides of the pan (Butter!) and was impossible to clean off following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions. I wanted a tough, easy-to-clean pan for small jobs. What I got was a small-job pan ok (one slice of bread pretty much fills it), with detailed instructions from the manufacturer about how to baby it. Phooey. I should have bought the cast iron skillet I set out to buy in the first place."
4,Grungor Is Better Than I Imagined,"Wow! This fantastic album deserves more attention in the Praise and Worship community. Michael is a capable singer and a fantastic guitarist who -along with Israel Houghton- has penned some awesome P&W songs for this CD. My personal favorites are ""Friend of God"" and ""Little Kingdom,"" but the entire CD is excellent."
2,Not informative enough,"The pictures are wonderful....but pictures without any background are only of so much value. These pictures would have made great inserts into a book on any of these parks....but as a stand-alone book, they certainly aren't worth the money."
3,Oh well!,"I have bought this audio book because i needed something to listen through my long commute, and it was only $4.95. This story was very predictable and nothing original since I pretty much have read various books with the same storyline.Anyways, it kept me company. It served it purpose but I wasnt impress."
4,Good old New Orleans jazz,"I'm really enjoying this one. It brings back a lot of memories. I only gave it 4 stars because a couple of the songs are recorded at too slow a tempo. For the most part though its pure good music, well performed by people who know their jazz. I listened to it to and from work today and the tunes are still going through my head."
4,Nice Jazz,"My family history goes back to New Orleans, this has some really good jazz band music. The city has returned and so has the music."
3,flfundoc,"This is simply a re-release of the original. If you own and played the original, don't bother buying MPII; it's the same game. Is a great game, lots of ways to win and ""work"" the system--but was looking forward to some new twists on the original and was very disappointed. Should have been called Merchant Prince 1.01 (to be fair to the buyer). (Four stars to the original, minus one for getting me to buy it again.)"
1,The worst game EVER,"This is the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of computer games. It is so bad, you might want to buy it just to experience the misery. What makes this game so bad and ultimately unplayable is the user interface, which is a cryptic and bewildering collage of badly-rendered artwork. Once you have found the random icon that lets you actually trade goods, you are left with a number of important questions, such as ""Am I buying now, or an I selling now?"" ""How much money do I have?"" and ""What is the object of this game, how do I win, and what should I be doing?"" I tried to play this game three times and I never completed a single turn. This one should never have been released."
1,Don't waste the money,"The premise for the game is as good as it is familiar. Take stuff from here and trade it there for more than you paid. You build up trade routes, buy influence at court, etc. Unfortunately, the game stinks. The trade route option doesn't work, you are forced to micro-manage at every step even the piddling ones that really should be automated.If you are looking for a good trading sim, don't buy this one."
5,Exciting Jolting Benders!,"Funny - I purchased the jolting benders because my husband was in the website and fell inlove with these other acrobats. When I, however, saw these in the baseball themes, I knew I had to purchase them for him. We are Yankee Fans and guess what? When these arrived, my husband fell inlove with them. He bends them every which way and loves how the ball and bat is magnetic enough to stay on! Excellent choice for people inlove with little creative gadgets!"
2,This is not a toy,This robot is not a toy. This is actually stated on the box. It is acollector's item.
1,Overpriced and Doesn't Work,"It's described as a ""collectible replica"" but this is a ruse to command $30 plus for this robot. Wind it up and it does nothing but raise its legs in place. Pretty boring and if it truly was a REPLICA, it would/should work like the original; walk forward! Seriously, has the toy industry degraded so much and consumer expectations so diminished such that toy manufacturers can't even deliver a wind up robot that can walk?! And I would hardly describe this robot as ""fragile""."
5,Just why can't she write three times as fast?,"I'm torn between begging her to write faster, yet sure I want her to never let down her quality. Lois' quality as a writer is still improving. This is a tapestry of persons you want to spend time with, situations you want to watch unfold and calamities that make you laugh out loud. I've re-read this book at least four times already and STILL am finding new details to enjoy. The series should be read in order, however, starting with Cordelia's Honor (including both Shards of Honor and Barrayar).When reading the best books, I really wish I could know the people and live among them to see the events the writer hasn't time to write down for us. This is one of the best books by the best writer of our time. Really, I like her a lot."
5,Go Miles!!!!,"This will be a short and sweet review: This is a wonderful SF novel, and definitely one of the best in this series. Buy it! Read it! Love it!"
5,A focal-point book in the Vorkosigan series,"Miles has met Ekaterin earlier, in ""Komarr"", and is now madly in love with her. Unfortunately, she is still recovering from her marriage and has wrapped herself in her widowhood to avoid courtship. So he has to court her in secret... without her realizing it! VERY funny, well-written book with Barrayaran politics and not many explosions. It would help if you've read previous Vorkosigan books before this one, but you might enjoy it even if you haven't read What Has Gone Before."
3,"Good, but not as good as the earlier books","I have been a Miles junkie from way back, but the more recent offerings in this series have served to wean me off the addiction. I understand that the types who like cute and clever romance love this book, and that's all well and good, but I misstrhe real Miles. I'm sorry.The book is entertaining, and there are a few passages that are quite funny. But unlike Elizabeth Hayden, who infuses humor into romance, action, reflection and history with stellar characters, I feel that Bujold has sold Miles out a little. Still, it's worth reading. It just doesn't merit all the adulation."
5,Keeps my daughter's attention!,"I don't know what it is about this dvd, but my 9 month old daughter loves it! She pays attention the whole time. I think it is because this dvd shows a lot of pictures of baby's faces. I have tried other Brainy Baby dvds and they do not keep her attention like this one. My 3 year old even likes to watch this one. Good buy."
2,Review was needed.,+1 star for being made out of solid stock metal.+1 star for grinding decent amount of pepper.-1 star for very small peppercorn space.-1 star for cheesy stamped tin holders- a sneeze will knock them over.-1 star for the money i spent and not being happy.there's better products out there...
2,"Looks good, that's about it","I just got these, the pepper one was defective so I am sending them back for a replacement only because I got 25 bucks off 125 deal on the kitchen and baths, otherwise I would have just taken a refund. Get something else. I plan to just keep them to give as a gift or something. There are much more superior products out there. I am sure you will be disappointed if you purchase this set."
1,Garbage,Total piece of garbage. Tons of electronic noise/static/interference sounds awful. The radio won't scan for channels and doesn't even store channels. DO NOT BUY.
1,P.O.S.,"Well all I can say about this radio is, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!! P.O.S. (and that doesn't stand for point of sale.) $30 for a radio is extreamly cheap, and what you get is a radio worth exactly that. The buttons get stuck which you then have to take the face off to realign the button with the switch. However feature wise the Sd card slot, aux in, usb, and reciver are great, perhaps they could add a shuffle function to the sd card and usd."
1,Read Hanadel's book instead,"I read both of the books on the Ewell murders, and this one the poorer by a long shot. It is full of errors and typos, and it indulges in hyperbole about how Dana Ewell's entire generation lacks morals and the such. In short, it's very poorly written. Hanadel's books covers all the same material and a lot more in a far clearer exposition."
3,Cheesy yet captivating (at points),"I read this book because I am a former college dorm-mate of one of the defendants in this case.I found the overall contentof the book to be very well laid out, but the writing style led me to think the author wrote this book in a few days. There were points in the book at which I laughed out loud (ie, describing one of the defendants as having a ""bad hair day"" the day he was arrested) and points at which I couldn't put the book down. The description of the ballistics evidence was quite compelling.Theonly draw back to the book is that it ends just as the preliminary hearings for the Defendants begin, so you won't know if these guys are convicted. However, the trial is going on right now, so no one knows what will happen for a few more months.This is a must read for those who like true stories about people who kill to inherit millions, and for anyone who went to Santa Clara University in the early nineties."
5,Smooth Oldskool,This CD is awesome if you like that kinda oldskool you can groove to over candle light with your special someone.
4,SUPER Fast Shipping,"Amazing! I received my package before I got the shipment notification!That being said, these are impressively heavy and very attractive. I was worried that the copper finish wouldn't match the faucets I ordered, but they go together perfectly. I rated 4 stars because I have not installed these yet."
2,the london orginal cast is much better,i like sarah and michael crawford more. they have a sweeter voice than caine and colm. Ms caine doesn't suit the role of christine. Her voice and skills are too old!!!which contradict christine's role as a young chorus girl. Sarah has done a much better job.
2,"Valjean Yes, Phantom No!","Though the musical arrangement is tighter than the OLC version, the vocals suffer terribly. The contrast is pretty jarring. Colm's voice is much too earthy and breathy. Michael Crawford's ethereal voice and flowing singing makes the Phantom sound much more like an ""angel."""
5,Good Quality and Highly Adorable,"This growth chart is the nicest I've seen. Mostly because I love the illustrations of Anita Jeram, but it is also very well-made. It is a tri-fold design mounted on heavy board with a creme satin ribbon for hanging. It also comes with stickers to mark ""I am one."" and so on and it has wallet-size slots for photos. The slots are filled with illustrations so they look cute even before you have a chance to fill them with photos of your little cutie!"
3,FAIR,"THIS BOOK WAS IN GOOD SHAPE WHICH I ORDERED AS A GIFT AND THE SELLER DID NOT TELL ME THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN ON THE INSIDE, SO I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN IT, BUT OVER ALL THE BOOK WAS IN GOOD CONDITION. THANKS."
3,What a Year It Was!,"I wasn't very careful when I purchased this item and had to return it. I did a search on ""50"" and this came up. It was just what I was looking for, so I purchased it. The next day I realized that my birthday person was actually born in 1957 -- and NOT 1955. Be more careful than I was so you don't have to return it!"
2,Stain,"Hi, I really like these shoes, however, was disappointed to see what appears to be a stain on the right toe area .. because they are suede .. I dare not even try to remove on my own .. it just looks as though whoever packed these shoes, or checked them, may have had a dirty thumb or spilled something on them .. it is noticeable .. but then again .. it is not .. so I just feel as though the cost of shipping them back is not worth it to me .. they are kick around shoes that I have worn as a young adult and now again as an older woman .. brings back memories .. hehe .. thanks for asking ..."
1,TOO MUCH FOR TOO LITTLE,I have both Dreamcast and PS2. Bottom line is RIGHT NOW Dreamcast is the much better deal. You can match up game for game and Dreamcast comes out on top. People need to relize that game play and control is the main reason people enjoy games. Graphics only enhance THAT experience. And right now there isn't anything better graphically on PS2. What I should have done was take the ... I have spent so far on the PS2 and used that to snap up every Dreamcast game available! Then when the price drops on PS2 pick that up. I was to greedy to have the best and didn't realize that I already had the best.
4,Battle B-Daman Direct Hit Figure: Cobalt Blade,really just the best on time great price not well pact thinking for use it again in time still good time
3,"comfy, but starfish fell off",I think that it was a good buy and fit my wedding theme perfectly. I liked the colors and that there was one to keep and one to throw. I didnt like that the starfish looked cheap and that it fell off when my husband was doing the garter thing. He came out of my dress and said oooppps I broke it...
5,milk thistle,it is the best take it for liver detoxifaction especially since we are on statin drugs.
3,It had so much potential...,"I thought the concept behind the 2 ""Dark Passions"" books was terrific--but the results were less than I'd hoped for.Some of the characters were very well drawn--Seven of Nine, for example--while others were rushed or glossed over: why does the second novel's cover prominently feature Crusher and Janeway, when Janeway played a minor role in the text and Crusher was barely mentioned? The plot also wavered, with parts being brisk and exciting while others felt rushed and not very well thought out.On the plus side, the author did a good job including characters from all three contemporary Star Trek series, and the relationships between them were, for the most part, believable (if occasionally thin).All in all, not a bad pair of books, but not all they might have been."
4,So you want to own a Weimaraner?,"This book is a brief overview of the history, training, breeding and owning of this breed. It tells of common behavior problems and easy fixes. It warns at length of the amount of work and patience needed for this breed. I would like the book to be longer and have a more inclusive history, but for the person looking for a quick read it is acceptable. I would recommend this book to someone looking to get a Weimaraner. Just remember no matter how much you read, you are never fully prepared for the patience and work needed to own this breed. We love our dog and so far do not regret getting our little girl, but she is a lot of work, as they all are."
1,I threw this in the trash without remorse...,"Possibly the most useless book I've ever owned. Way way way too much text devoted to being a ""well-behaved"" coach - all the same drivel we hear ad nauseum from every training lecture for every sport including every required county certification process.All good to know - but if you haven't gotten the idea about safety, sprotsmanship, fun, etc. already, it's unlikely this book is going to change your attitude.Meanwhile, it goes into astonishingly little useful detail on the topic its title claims - LACROSSE.Worst coaching book ever. You've been warned.The Baffled Parents Guide actually explains lacrosse in more useful detail than this alleged ""coaching"" book does."
2,It's okay if you're looking for a little junk reading.,"This book was too predictable. One of the main characters, Justin, is a jerk. You instantly dislike him and the development of his character is immature. The only thing that saves this book is its suspense towards the end. I was disappointed until a little more than halfway through, in fact, I almost gave up on it. But if you want a little erotica, go for it."
4,DESIRE ME ONLY BY THEA DEVINE.,"THE OUTLINE OF THE STORY WAS INTERESTING BUT THE PLOT COULD HAVE USE MORE HELP. MS. DEVINE BOOKS ARE SENSUAL. AND EROTIC. READING THOSE SCENES, CAN MAKE YOU FORGET THAT THERE'S NO PLOT. THE FEMALE CHARACTER THINK TOO MUCH. I JUST WANT TO TELL HER TO SHUT UP ALL READY. BUT I RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK IF YOU LIKE EROTIC SCENES, BUT NOT VERY THOUGHT OUT PLOT DEVOLOPMENT."
4,Eskysenior,I use this for my truck and it gives a place to put my coffee when driving with my dog because the regular cup holder is where the dog sits.
2,not worh it,"When you can get Starcraft for less, why spend $ on Outlive? Its basically Starcraft 1 1/2. A few modifications, support for higher resolution, and bad sound don't add up to that cost. Wait til its in the bargain bin and then give it a try.I think the company would have been better off working with Blizzard on another mod pack for Starcraft."
2,A rather thin tea.,"This movie does have moments of charm but mostly it can be annoying. The pacing and plot seem to be a nod to Ozu, while the quirkiness seems to be a nod to early Miike, I suspect. Regardless, the character development is poor at best, the continuity is non-existent at times and the acting only so-so. At least 45 minutes too long. Snappier pacing, tighter plot and fewer characters could have earned this another star, at least. Not knowing what to leave on the cutting room floor kills another movie."
2,Long on minutes short of plot and continuity...,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, but I had to force myself to watch it all the way though. Yes, it has some quirky characters and cute moments. The photography is beautiful. Unfortunately that IS the film. You cut from one character to another witnessing minor events in each life. There are no stirring transformation, just a collection of everyday events that go on much too long."
5,Wow!!,"Excellent picture, large flat screen, bright colours with no obvious distortions. Weighty but it is a 19"" though it's almost as small as a 17"". Excellent buy for the price."
3,Good series. Poor DVD quality,"""The Complete Third and Fourth Seasons"" would not be bad except for two reasons. The most bothersome is that my first DVD set had a defect that would not allow me to play episodes 16 and 17 on disc 3. The replacement set did the same thing. I tried the disc on 4 different DVD players and my two computers. The players ranged from a high end Sony to a low end Magnavox and mid priced Samsung. The computers tried were a new IBM laptop and my two year old Compaq decktop. None of them would play these episodes without either hanging up or skiping. The other problem is the poor quality of the video transfers. The color quality changes with almost every scene change. It can be very good or very bad with washed out color. Warner Brothers needs to use more care when bringing out these great sets."
1,the product was in poor condition,"the product came broken, seems again used instead want a refund. the name of the brand launch is delete, this estillado glass and scratched. Offer is misleading because seeing the physical product is totally different, I bought a new product unused"
2,Not so super,"I got this album because based on all the hype, I figured it had to be pretty darn amazing. However, the songs are pretty boring and simplistic. Yes, the story of Chris Lucey (or Bobby Jameson, whatever) is crazy, and his story is the kind of stuff that Rock n Roll is made of, but the album just isn't that good. If I ever pop the CD into my stereo, it is just to listen to the first song. Regardless, I'd love to know what Chris Lucey is up to now. Anyone know?"
5,Good lead,"I use this with dogs at a shelter and it works great. They are comfortable, easy to slip on, and I am easily in control once they leave the kennel."
4,"training leash, for bigger dogs","Was too big for my 10 lb dog. Didn't read clearly enough, and gave to a friend with a 50 lb dog. Repurchased the smaller version."
2,Cheap plastic,This mandoline functioned extremely well for 2 months. Then the plastic shattered after being dropped from counter-height onto linoleum. NOT DURABLE.
4,Breeze to clean,"For the most part, cutting with a knife is easiest. But for the really big jobs - this thing cuts like a breeze. The blade choices are great as is the storage system. Best one I have seen on the market."
1,Waste of Money.....Big Disappointment,"The item is basically useless for me. It was not easy to use, it did not cut stuff as shown. It was awkward to use and the safety handle is useless. I was really disappointed with it...Dont waste your money on it. If my husband hadnt thrown out the box I would be returning it...."
3,Just average,"This product was just average, not great. I found it awkward to use when trying to cut thicker slices. I was also not very impressed with the limited range of thickness you can cut your food."
3,Passpartu,"It's ""back to songs."" And not the best ones. If their first few albums also featured songs (with the only exception being Jet Lag), they were more of a prog band. Here they turned into an Italian pop group."
3,Not the Best Season of Lost in Space...,"This particular season of Lost in Space very hokey, with a poor plot in some of the episodes. The first season had the best episodes, that even with few (if any) special effects managed to be very good. The episodes in this season are very cheezy, with even noticable mistakes. They are kind of funny, but don't make much of a story. Season three is a little better, less hokey.If you really like the show, then you should get this volume, but the stories are certainly less complicated. It is pretty funny and can be enjoyed though, so I might recommend it, but for humor alone."
5,What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon,"My favorite, as a child I watched Lost in Space when the episodes were black and white. As an adult I purchased all seasons of Lost in Space, and enjoy watching them all over again. Irwin Allen is a genius."
3,old game,"fun when first purchase, however the SOE / everquest line has been a dead bread for a while.save your money and buy something more recent."
3,Good Expansion Pack,"We played EQ2 for around a month, the first two weeks were without this expansion pack. In retrospect we should have bought this expansion (which includes the original EQ2) from the get go. It has a lot of features that enhance the game for any level. When ever someone mentions upgrading from Trial of Isle or starting EQ2 I tell them to buy this expansion instead of the original EQ, it's like getting an expansion for free."
3,large display but dim indoors,"The large display has big, easy to read menu commands, but the image is almost invisible with indoor lighting. Someone suggested that the LCD screen might eat batteries for breakfast because it's so big, but it just doesn't amplify indoor images enough to see what's going on. The photo quality is good. If you're outside most of the time and can't read the typical menu commands with a standard LCD screen, this camera's OK."
4,good camera,this camera was a gift on christmas and i really like it. It is not the best camera in the world but it gets the job done. It has a couple of small problems like if u take a picture too close to a object(like a person) it will just show a big white blob if u use flash. and if u take a picture to far away it kinda ends up purple. But other wise it is a very good camera for the money i also like that it has rechargable batteries because i hated having to keep going to the store to find the right one. I also love the fact that it has a 3 1/2 inch screen. so if you are looking for a good camera for a child and dont want to spend alot of money then this is a great camera for you.
3,I don't know,I'm not sure this product works or not. I have really seen any difference in my metabolism since using it.
3,Shake and Bake,If you like somewhat affected old vampire queens who view themselves and the gay Miss Marple you will have fun with this lite mystery.
3,Nice flavor but...,"I bought this as a subscribe and save based on how yummy it sounds. That is a subscription that I will be cancelling. While it is decent tea, I will not be drinking it regularly. There are so many other flavors that have a kick to them that this bland tea just isnt worth my time, money or calories."
5,Great taste. Love it!,"I am a tea drinker! I love this tea. Took me a few to get into it, but now I'm in love. Nice product. Great price."
2,Not dry erase,"These do not erase with a dry eraser. You have to use whiteboard cleaner and it is a mess. Magnetic works, but I will be replacing the ones I bought with a board that dry erases."
5,ROCK HUDSON & DORIS DAY COLLECTION,LOVE THE MOVIES. QUALITY OF COLOR WONDERFUL AND A SPECIAL MUSIC CD BONUS! VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SELECTION.
5,Perfect for chinchillas!,"I had no idea this product was going to be as big as it was, and I was surprised at how flexible it is despite its size.I originally planned to keep it at the bottom of her cage as a bridge, but it was too big to fit in between her wheel and the bottom shelf of her cage. So I contorted it into a tunnel and was able to fit it perfectly on one of her shelves. It's stable (stays in place; doesn't roll around), and my chin loves to climb up on it and inside of it."
4,Larger than I had anticipated.,"I've seen the medium and small versions at the pet shop and figured this would be just a small step above those (since the difference in those are about tripple); this thing is gigantic! It works well for a hideaway for playtime in a playpen, but it wouldn't fit in your average habitat by any means...Bruce and Selina (Batman and Catwoman; our 4 month old guinea pigs) love to hide in it, and it makes it more fun for the kids being able to see them both snuggle under it (versus not being able to see them in their igloo in their normal home)If you have the space I highly recommend this item! If you don't have the space, I'd recommend the medium."
4,Sturdy play toy for my rabbit,"For the price, this is a sturdy and long lasting chew toy for my rabbit. It easily folds into various shapes. Colors are bright and fun. I'm only giving it 4.5 stars, as even this is a 'large', it is still too small for my rabbit to crawl under (he weights 6 pounds). I wanted to use it as a place for him to hang out under, and thought it would be taller."
4,Fiddle Sticks hideout,"My bunny likes it ""ok""...she chewed on it a little bit the first day I had it home for her. She's gone under it a couple times but mainly uses it to sit on. It's rather large so I don't have it inside her cage, I leave it out for her to use when she is running loose in the apartment. Perhaps if she had free access to it, her feelings for it would improve but as it is...it's just a large blob of colorful rods in my living room. (I set it up so she can sleep under it if she chooses.) I may flatten it so she can use it more as a toy and will see how that goes.*EDIT* I flattened this out so that it only has a little ""wave"" in it now, and she likes it much better to chew on."
4,Very good size for guinea pigs,"I wish these still came in neutral colours, but it is a great addition to my guinea pigs' cage. I just make a simple half tunnel with it and the pigs like to gnaw on the sides and they'll climb up on it if I'm tempting them with something tasty."
2,Hype + Misleading reviews= bad purchase.,"It's becoming quite bothersome to me when I purchase records that I hear so many good things about, but fail to deliver. I've heard nothing but good things about both the BOTW records so I purchased them. I can't convey how mediocre these albums are. It's straight-up hipster music made by hipsters...for hipsters. No depth to the songs what so ever. They're probably not junkies but they try very hard to sound like them and the music would probably sound good if I was shooting smack. But I'm not. It's one thing to rip off your elders and influences,thats fine. But at least write good songs if you're going to do that. The vocals, especially the male vocals, are so abarasive I find myself just changing the song it's so unbearable. There are a few decent songs, mostly the ones sung by the sister. I wish there were more honest reviews out there. This is not groundbreaking...its not even melodic or remotley interesting."

1,Where's the Hat?,"I've been waiting about a month for this hat. Never mind that the ""Shipping and Handling"" from this vendor is a ripoff, when they did ""send the item"" about two weeks ago they sent me a sweatshirt instead of a hat. The invoice in the package listed a hat! Guess they use different nouns in California. At least they were courteous when I called and sent a prepaid mailing label. When the item was returned they now say the hat is backordered. I haven't seen this kind of incompetence from a vendor in a while. Since I can't get the item locally, I'll have to wait a while or just cancel the whole thing. I'm kind of interested in waiting though, this time maybe they'll send the cheese slicer I need!"
3,Faded Color and Lightweight Fabric,"These caps are okay, but the fabric is color washed, giving it a faded look, and are of lightweight twill fabric. My sister purchased these for my husband, but we returned them for others that were far less expensive."
3,Lifesize adult skull model,"The product is aa advertised, but if you dont check the measurments you might not realize that 81/2 inches is NOT a lifesized adult human skull. They should change their description to 3/4 size or something. I knew that going in and am happy, but I wish it were indeed full sized. It arrived on time and I am pleased with the overall transaction."
3,Acceptable for price.,"It's very sturdy but is missing a lot of small details. It's cast, so, for instance, the teeth are not separated. As another reviewer noted, the teeth are particularly bad. For the price it's acceptable. I bought it to draw. A medical student would probably want something a lot more detailed. I used polymer clay to make the teeth more toothy.I just looked at the picture. That's not the same skull at all. So that's not good."
1,junk,"The jaw is way too big, it does not fit together properly and will not work for the model I needed."
5,Ant Phillips best ever!!,"I first heard this working in a record store in the Midwest when it came out. I've listened ever since. The feeling it gives is like that of The LArk Ascending by Vaughn Williams; if you start your day hearing it, your moments are better. It's good to have it echoeing about the mind as the colors change toward sunset...Get it. Ignore the negative reviews; they obviously lack a soul or suffer from short attention problems!!!D Jones"
5,Very Good!!!,"First of all, this DVD features ALL the cartoons!!! And, you don't even need to know the language to watch them because they all have a minimal amount of talking!!! SIX THUMBS UP!!!"
2,bad quality,I purchased this bag for work. The strap came apart at the seam the first time it was used. The zipper is still in place. You get what you pay for.
3,I'm not so sure,"I haven't really gotten a great deal from this book... although I know that F.F.Bruce is one of the great scholars on the book of Acts. I know they say that sometimes the art and artist critique the critic-- and what you say reveals more about you yourself than about the great master. That could definitely be the case here. No doubt this man 1) knows the Scripture, and 2) has written and ministered with the power and authority of God...But, if you can only buy one book (commentary) on Acts, go try Adjith Fernando's NIV Application Commentary."
2,Dissapointed it's not in widescreen,Can't complain about the content and I don't give a hoot about BlueRay since no one has a player but Football is perfect for a widescreen TV. Watching it in 4:3 removes 1/3 of the viewable field. Awful!
4,Great set with some disappointments.,"I could have easily given this 3 stars or 5 stars. I'm excited to own 5 great games of the greatest Giants' season ever, but the disks disappoint somewhat. If they're not going to put out a Blu-ray version, could they at least put out a widescreen version? It's 2008. How many people are still watching 4:3 TV? If you still are, then these DVD's are a 5. My favorite part of the collection is the Super Bowl DVD with Michael Strahan's commentary track. I just watched the whole thing and you get to hear his comments on every single play. This leads to one final disappointment. There is nothing of the post game on here. I mean zero. Manning takes the final snap, and the DVD goes to the credits. Are you kidding me? Bottom line, if you're a Giants' fan, you have to buy this. Just be prepared it will probably leave you wanting more from it."
5,G-Men!!!,"Actually just watched Disc 2, the Tampa Bay game an hour ago. Giant fans need to add this to their collection."
2,The standard def resolution makes it a poor choice,"Having recorded all of the Giants playoff games in high-def, I was at least hoping for a wide-screen format so that I can delete the recordings on my HD-DVR which is taking up a huge amount of space. I hope there is a future version in the Blu-ray format or at least in widescreen. The picture quality is horrible and since it is in 4:3 you would have to upscale to full screen in order to at least approach anthing decent."
5,Frequent volume control and other usage,"This device is very useful to increase / decrease volume in these situation:- When you got a phone call- mp3, game, internet radio, skype, and movie are all different volume.- To take care your roommate in midnightI just realized that controling volume with this device change my work style because I like to ajust the volume when I working on programming without breaking my concentration. Especially when I change Jazz to Classic music, I have to increase volume a little bit because most of classic music's volume level are low.As for other usage, I use this for movie editing. I used to set the scroll to scrab the time line, but actually, zoom in/out is useful setting for Adobe Premiere."
1,doesn't work with After Effects timeline,"Doesn't work with Adobe After Effects timeline. From keyboard I use ""PgUp"" and ""PgDn"" keystrokes to move left and right. However when I assign these keystrokes to Griffin Powermate it doesn't work at all. Called they technical support, but they had nothing to say."
3,Not bad. It'll make you reconsider jury duty.,"I started this book at 11 p.m. and finished it by 1 a.m. Gripping read, strong characters, though perhaps not enough supporting cast (at least, my feeling at the end of the book was that there weren't enough survivors). Maybe the only fault is that some of the ""scary"" parts seemed scripted more for a Monday night TV movie than for a real psychological thriller"
1,Mormons see this book as supporting thier view,"Mormons see this book as supporting thier view, I don't why some of the acedemic books sell for hundreds of dollars. If you are interested in this view of Baptism of the Dead, there are many free papers written with the same information and used copies cost much less."
1,Scam,This CD is a Scam. This is just an infomercial to join his website and buy his book. I have done both and haven't found any good information. He relies on the research of others. To buy everything organic one has to be millionaire. Especially if you have to feed a family.
3,Decent option on carb mgmt diet,"I have used the South Beach bars for about a year but they have been problematic. The nutrition content is good and the taste is okay. They do tend to cause some mild digestive distress though, especially if you are not careful to watch the rest of your diet. This may be just an individual issue but both my wife and I experience it."
1,Over Priced and you only get 1 Box of 12 Bars,"This product is misrepresented as a 12-pack of boxes. It only contains one box of twelve bars (unlike the other south beach bar packs). Therefore, these bars are much cheaper at the local grocer so don't waste your money."
4,A lovely tome for all ages,"Calcutta is a charming, smoothly constructed tale - part love story, part exciting salt water tournament billfishing competition, and part just plain fun.It begins and ends in the fabulous Florida Keys, and in the middle are sandwiched plush, exotic ports of call throughout the posh Caribbean.The prose is simple but well-crafted, and the work itself is without question ""G"" rated, ie: suitable for all ages.You - and even your children - will love the characters you're supposed to love, and hate those you're supposed to hate.Read it on the beach, or on a boat, and then share it with someone you love. Enjoy."
4,this is banging,yo i checked out this cd and it made me feel like getting up and wanting to go to a party if you think that reggae gold 2002 was hot check this out
1,Wish I Had Known,"These bags are MADE IN CHINA. If I had known this to begin with, I never would have ordered them."
5,Perfect,"I wanted a salad spinner but our cabinets are filled. I stumbled onto this product and it's awesome. Not only does it work as a salad spinner, but it stores veggies and keeps them much longer than they would normally keep. I highly recommend these bags."
5,Grand finale,"When I was a kid, this Survivor Series was one of my favorite VHS and still is.It happened at a time when the then WWF was jampacked with original characters and talents.This Survivor Series had participants with awesome names such as ""Undertaker"", ""Legion of Doom"", ""Ultimate Warrior"", ""Hulk"", ""Earthquake"". In brief, nothing but characters coming straight from another world. They made pro-wrestling so fun and exciting. Real-life heroes. Nowadays none of this magic exists in the same wrestling promotion.This Survivor Series differed from others because it had a grand finale, in which all survivors participated."
2,"Better Than ""Sensual World"" but Sound Quality Still Sucks!","Credit to Kate for trying her hand again at production after the terrible job that she did on ""Sensual World"" but still although an improvement over the previous album, the sound quality is not good reflecting poor mastering and inconsistent volume levels and balance yet again. In terms of the material though, the tracks are an improvement over the previous album. This version isn't remastered and so although you get the mini-lp sleeve replica packaging, you don't get the expected improved sound quality over what's already out there and so I'd recommend given the very high price to ignore this one and either hold on to the old version that you have or get the cheaper remastered versions that are out there. Overall a much better effort on all fronts than ""Sensual World"" although still not as good as her brilliant efforts on ""Never For Ever"" and ""Lionheart""."
5,A fun book with detailed information and great photos,"Quick and easy to read, Jodie gets right to it, giving the reader a touching vivid account of her experience with the ""other side"". Very interesting, and a good read. The ghosts in the photographs can be seen by anyone with a little patience, you have to search for the images in a few of the photos. Highly recommended anytime, but especially fun during the halloween season."
1,Keep your receipt,"This book is horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. The story lacks credibility, the so-called ghost photographs are reflections of trees in windows, and the poor grammar makes the reader want to commit hara-kiri."
4,Good for teaching about Native Americans,"This book describes the story of Indians who lost their land to the white people. The story is told by the main character, Chief Seattle. The illustrations in the book are very realistic and full of detail. They make you feel as if you are really part of the story. We found the book to be easy for third graders to read. We think this book would be great for people who are interested in learning about Native Americans or for students who are learning about them. We really liked reading this book."
1,New Age Tripe,The article that Mrs. Montano refers to in her review actually says that there is overwhleming evidence that Chief Seattle did not make this speech! You can google it up yourself and see. Wanting to believe something does not make it so.
3,Dysfunctional relationships,"This 1979 film by Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci is an unusual blend of psychological melodrama and visually impressive photography. The storyline is mainly about dysfunctional relationships. The late Jill Clayburgh plays an aspiring opera singer, deeply frustrated by a loveless marriage and a delinquent son born out of wedlock. When her husband dies, she travels to Italy to renew her relationship with her former lover, only to see her son fall further into drug addiction. There are bizarre twists, with hints of bisexuality and incest. Relationships remain tangled, and the ending is ambiguous. All this plays out against magnificent backgrounds, particularly scenes of the Italian countryside. The result is a film that is strangely murky and unresolved."
3,For die-hard fans only...,"I give season 8 a 3-star rating, which is relative to other tv shows. Compared to Red Dwarf at its finest (seasons 1-5), I think it's barely a 2.By season 8 the show was only a pale shadow of its former self. I'm shocked at how un-funny it is. Also, the actors have noticeably aged...their characters are meant to be twenty-something not, middle-aged.Back in the early 90s, Chris Barrie said he hoped Red Dwarf would have a ""proper ending"", i.e., wouldn't go on unnecessarily. Sadly, that didn't come about due to the long gap between seasons 6 and 7 and the enormous popularity of the series. It's a real shame that season 8 is apparently the end of Red Dwarf, since the long-anticipated movie probably won't happen now (and I think the tv cast are too old for it now anyway). Red Dwarf RIP (1988-1999) :("
5,Yo Smegheads!,"This is better than just buying the plain old DVD. I wish BBC had done all the previous series' with an on pack addition.You can't get any better than Red Dwarf. One of the best, if not the best, shows ever. This is the last series until the movie comes out. Enjoy it!!!"
3,Another great DVD from the Dwarfers,"After series 7, series co creator and writer Doug Naylor decided to take the show back to it's roots with series 8. First setting it back on Red Dwarf and reviveing the entire original crew. There are some great comedy moments in this season but most of the time i felt as though i was watching a half arsed version of the great comedy classic. You would think with Rimmer and Holly back along with the Skutters that the show would go right back to it's comedy roots but unfortunatly it all seems wrong somehow. The jokes don't feel as witty or as clever as the other series, in fact i found some of the jokes to be embarassing and painfully unfunny. All in all series 8 is a big let down. Thankfully the BBC appeared to have delivered the goods once again with the DVD extras so it's not all bad news and there are some good episodes in here such as 'Cassandra' and 'Krytie TV' which are two of my personal favourites from this season."
4,What is in this book,"This book is absolutly fantastic!. It has the currently best fantasy authors such as Robert Jordan, Raymond E Feist and George R.R Martin. Such talent will no doubt provide a great read for you, especially if you are a fantasy lover. Even if you are not, the depth of such short story's is unbelieveable and for a reasonable price this book is a must get for your bookshelf. Cracking Stuff!"
4,"I am finally able to admit it, I am in love with Roland","what can I say? He's wonderful, he's my hero! ""Little Sisters"" was the only story I read; bought the book for the SK story only/Excellent read, did it in one night! More Roland PLEASE! Thanks Mr. King!"
4,Grouped greatness,"The first book in an outstanding anthology series. Each short novel of this volume is worth the price of the book, and you get them all.If you like any of the authors here, this is a MUST own."
4,Refreshing re-visit...,Not remixes but re-interpretations of her classic tracks and a few covers. I like this concept and it really worked well with most of this material. Much better than a greatest hits of material we already have.
2,Only a QVC fan could enjoy this.,I bought this book to see what happened to Jeffery Hewson. She mentioned him but I still don't know what happened to him. I really don't like Kathy Levine much and the book just confirmed my original opinon. She loves herself!
5,Great product,"Great product for a good price. Looks great and very bright. Easy installation if you follows instructions, it took me an hour. I highly recommend."
1,damage,"Product came damaged. The welds were broken in several areas, and the unit was twisted. Because this item was hard to find I had it rewelded and straighten at s professional shop. Bottom line it cost me $50.00 more."
5,Interesting,I haven't had time to listen carefully through all five CD's yet but they're very interesting examples of early blue recordings and I'm glad I have them.
1,Ipod touch,If you have an IPOD touch dont bother buying this item. It will not work. I have a 32 gig touch and it did not work on mine. Item probably works good on the right IPOD.
5,Performs spectacularly,"One of the few RCA adaptors I found that uses the dock plug instead of the headphone plug. I believe this removes the volume restriction and so forth, and makes a cleaner output requiring you to jack up the volume less.Well constructed. Works with PXNI well for those who have Nissans."
5,So far working great,"I have been using this Hoodia for about 5 to 6 weeks now. It took about a week or two to start working, but I had read that could be the case so I did not get discouraged. I take 2 at breakfast and 2 at lunch. If I'm having a really bad day (only once or twice in the month) I'll take another 2 at dinner. I have now lost 20.1 pounds in 4 weeks. I am eating so little I can't believe I'm not starving. I'm not following a ""diet"" but just eating healthy and small portions. It's really working this time around and I believe the Hoodia is a big part of this reason. I have a friend though that took another brand of Hoodia and it didn't work for her. So maybe this doesn't work for everyone. I was hoping to see some other reviews here. But since I'm the first I'll just say it works for me and I hope it'll work for you. By the way, I have a LOT of weight to lose, over 100 pounds so 20 in a month is significant for me."
2,Really? No Way.,"A ridiculous ending topped off a book that you only needed to read 5 words per page to know the story.No way the ending could happen the way it did; there's photos, there's internet,there's the press; there's people who know.."
2,too christian,"started our fine, good plot, nice characters but then about halfway it got really religious. It's one thing to have God as a part of a story but this went way too far. you felt that you were being lectured. free or not free this book was difficult to get thru. skipped alot toward the end just to finish."
2,A little too cute!,"I picked up this book expecting great things but found the premise totally unbelievable and it bugged me right to the end. How many dedicated fans are there who don't look at the back of the book, see the author's picture and memorize whatever details they can find? This woman, a bookstore owner, no less, doesn't even recognize a superstar author when he walks into her?Sorry but I couldn't get past the inconsistencies."
4,Actually a wonderful book about forgiveness...,A real enjoyable book about a set of folks struggling with forgiveness...and their trust in God and eachother...A plus is the Gospel is shared...A possible warning it is very much a romance...
2,Plot was o.k. but....,"The plot was o.k. but some of it seemed over dramatic and far fetched. I have read Christian romanace before but it seemed like the author just threw in random bible quotes whenever it suited her where as other novels I have read were more subtle and were better about blending the relationship between man and God in the text. Overall, the flow of the book just did not go well for me."
2,I felt it was doing too much.,"to me this wads all over tyhe place... however, this wasn't my type of romance. not really my style so I'm not the one to go to for a real recommendation on it."
1,Howard at her worst.,"Linda Howard has the ability to draw you into her characters and understand their feelings about things. But she failed with this book. It was weak. Dione is a physical therpist who has been given the assignment to help Blake Walk again. The doctors said Blake would be able to walk but he doesn't believe it. He just gave up. A powerful man just giving up yea right... Dione is no better. She is probably the weakest character Linda has ever had....I kept thinking through out this book that these characters need some back bone. I was so angry with this story, I thought both characters should be alone to wallow in their own self pity....."
4,Another winner from Linda Howard.,Really enjoyed it. Love most of Linda Howard's work. Surprised it was an older book but it still carried a heavy punch.
2,More hocus pocus,"Went to chiropractor. Total illusion/hocus pocus routine with fake Xrays. Bought an inversion table. Slight relief but cumbersome. Went to Orthopedic Surgeon. The drugs worked well. Went back for the Cortisone shots. They worked well too. Still fighting the SI pain. Ordered this belt. After a solid week of 24/7 wearing I can honestly say if it wasn't for Ibuprofen I would be back to the doc for drugs. Removed belt two weeks ago. Feeling better now. It does not do a thing but add another element of textile around your hips. I actually had more pain WITH it! Nice novelty though. Maybe I can use it as an arm sling in the event something happens to my freaking arm as well. Don't believe the hype people. If it sounds like a miracle. Its not! Every doctor would stock it! Oh yeah, also got an electronic massager/muscle stimulator for $25 with 40 pads at $11. That actually does work pretty well. This belt, not so much."
1,Look for other review books,"I would definitely not recommend this book. If you have taken any math classes since 3rd grade, you will not need this book. The problem are way too easy and the conceptual discussions gloss over too much. There are better books out there to prepare you for the GMAT."
3,a not so good second part.,"Dark Passions part 2 is the sequel of the latest book dark passions while it is not a bad idea, I felt it could have been better. I guess it shows the problems many fans have with some the series they do a good first part but the seconds falls flat."
4,Good Product,Good:1. Stays connected into the 85252. Stays connected into the cigerette lighter in the vehicle3. Does not seem to be effecting the overall life of the battery.Bad:1. The cord could be a little longer.
2,ok,Nothing special. A little skeptical why price is so low. So far it works and nothing bad. Price is nice. That's about it
1,Like the others...bad packaging!!!,"If you read the reviews for all of the nails any size every single reviewer says the packaging is terrible. I am personally going to take this up with amazon, and have taken photos of the newly opened box. Are the nails good nails? Yes they are, but I really don't want to load the nail gun 2 at a time, I would prefer to load it 100 at a time, like how I ordered.Sadly the price is the same if I were to buy them at Home Depot, so I don't think I will be buying these again. Its just not worth it. The product will come damadged!DO NOT BUY THESE NAILS!"
3,Nice,"If you are an Angelou fan, that is, you've read all of her autobiographical work and are familiar with a wide range of her poetry and essays, then you are bound to be torn by her latest autobiographical piece, ""A Sung Flung Up To Heaven."" Although the writing is vibrant and accessible as usual, her story seems to be missing any new insights, or wisdom. There is very little in this writing that she hasn't said in previous accounts. There were sections of the book that appeared to be reiterated from previous work, yet the author seems to hold back when writing about the death of Malcom X and Dr. M. L. King. I thought for sure that Angelou's memory of those events would be told with more vivid detail and personal reflection.Overall, the book is an easy and interesting read. As a huge fan, I'm always excited to devour any of Angelou's work. I'm usually fully satiated by the experience, in this case however; I'm not as full as I could be and another helping of Angelou is in order."
4,Good collection,I really enjoyed this collection of violent mystery tales. I really never read anything quite like it before. It surprised me and let my jaw drop a few times. Good. Looking forward to another story about this character. Dack Shannon is an excellent anti-hero for a new century.
3,The war of the Roses,"War of the roses 2009, this book reminds me of the movie with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner minus Danny Devito. Very funny read and I like the ending. Keeping it HEA."
5,Better than Prozac!,"My mother read SILENT WITNESS and recommended it to me. I reluctantly picked it up-and couldn't put it down! I liked the small-town feel of the book, with all of its dark secrets. I loved the Tony Lord character (although a bit too heroic-am I reading wish-fulfillment from the author here?). Patterson has written a carefully thought out novel, with enough surprises to keep the reader glued. I dragged out the last 50 pages because I didn't want it to end. For the genre, this is a book to treasure!"
4,Great Story,"This is the first I have read of Richard North Patterson. What a good one to start with. It was wonderful storytelling, and even though i am not a big fan of legal thrillers, i couldn't really put this one down. I can't wait to dive into my next R.N.P."
5,Two parallel stories fit together perfectly,This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put the thing down. The first story kept me on the edge of my seat and seemed to be good enough to fill an entire book itself. The transfer to the second half was smooth and created an equally enthralling story that perfectly paralleled the first. The ending was intense and suprising. I wish I could read it again for the first time.
4,Page turner,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I think this book would be a dynamite movie. The mystery and intrigue was awsome. What made it really enjoyable was the fact you did not know who the bad guy was.
3,Patterson scores B+ with Silent Witness,"The pedestrian opening of Silent Witness almost bored me enough me to put it back on the shelf at the end of the first chapter. However, the second chapter was slightly more energetic and started to gather my interest.I wasn't able to really connect with any of the characters in the story. More than anything, the simple curiosity of ""whodunnit"" kept me interested.Overall, Silent Witness was passably entertaining bedside reading. I'd recommend it for a holiday or vacation... but don't expect to morn the loss of any of Patterson's characters when you're done."
3,"Tedious, tiresome, but a page turner nonetheless","After about a third of the book, I began hoping that slogging through the endless teen conversations and painfully repetitive musing was going to be worth it in the end. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed (clever twist ending), but getting there was torturous."
3,Nostalgic thriller with good courtroom suspense,"This legal thriller can't help but take you back to your own hometown and your own dark secrets. It's full of jealousy, betrayal, murder, forbidden love and a good flash-back style. The characters are well-developed, although the plot is a bit predictable. But though you might guess who the killer is long before the end, you'll hang on to figure out WHY, which is what makes a good mystery. The characters are interesting and hit close to home. These are the now-forty-someting kids you went to high school with"
5,Better than Expected,"I needed a one burner stove for car camping, and debated on this liquid fuel stove versus the Coleman propane single burner. Ended up buying both stoves just to test them out. I'm very impressed with the Sportster stove and it will be my choice for car camping. Convenient to operate, warms up quickly with a minimum of flaming, runs very hot compared to propane, and simmers reasonably well. Thee have been reports of problems getting it to simmer, but it simmered well for me after some experimentation. I think the secret is using reasonably fresh Coleman fuel (less than a year old), but mainly try approaching the simmer setting from the the ""OFF"" direction and not from the full on direction. Hard to explain, but when you turn the control lever fully to off and quickly back to on it will simmer very stably, but will flame out if you approach simmer from the full on direction.Bottom line, a good price from Amazon, and no disappointments with this stove."
2,ok but not great,"i just got mine used it for about a month. worked great, east to light and use. no probs there. why i give it the 2 stars is because i used unleaded gas in it for that month, which it says u can ( the reason it cost a few bucks more). i only used premium. but i guess what ppl are saying is that unleaded gas is dirty and plugs it up. which mine did in about a month. Its a easy fix but still why sell something that says duel fuel if the other fuel kills it. i just think that coleman needs to fix this or just not say its duel fuel anymore"
3,Not great with gasoline,"I bought this with out really paying attention to the ""not great with gasoline"" reviews. I've used it 6 or 7 times with gasoline which works after pumping it like 1000 times. The gas leaks a bit so be prepared entire top of the stove (including underneath the ""stove"" part on top) to catch fire occasionally -- which leaves a sooty black mess everywhere. LOL"
3,"Fine while it works, impossible to service in the field","I have had this stove for 4 years now and used it for a couple of long trips. It was working fine until the one way check valve that allows air into the tank got stuck. I got a replacement valve but it turned out to be impossible to remove the old valve as it was stuck. Car mechanics, metal shops, nobody could remove it. So I would rate this stove ""very poor"" in serviceability.I subsequently got another one of these, brand new, and tried to take the old one apart to salvage some useful spare parts. Other than the pump assembly it was impossible to remove anything else useful (e.g. generator, needle etc) as parts seem to be stuck and impossible to unscrew & remove as per assembly diagrams.If you need something that is serviceable in the field, I would go for something different."
4,Good camping stove,I bought this stove to add to use on weekend camping trips where weight is not an issue. It burns well and heats water/food quickly. Flame control is a little trouble. I generally just heat water and let the stove burn at full flame.Simple straight forward product that I enjoy using.
5,Big and heavy but awesomely powerful,"This stove is probably too big for backpacking or cycling, but pretty good if you are using motorised transport. Don't think about running it on petrol (gasoline) unless you want to be cleaning out the generator tube frequently. Use Coleman fuel or, if you can get it, Aspen 4 lawnmower fuel (alkylated petrol) which is even better and cheaper.It takes a little longer to settle down to a blue flame than my Coleman 550B but once it's there it burns extremely cleanly, just like butane, and is way more powerful than the 550B. The tank is big enough for a few days with the family.The only thing I can criticise is that (like most Coleman stuff) some parts are a buit flimsy and/or crude, like the grate. They get bent but you can bend them back again. All spares are available anyway.The US price is a steal - in the UK we have to pay about 70 pounds sterling, so it's twice the price."
5,Give it a listen !!!!,I've liked the Marshall Tucker Band for about 25 or more years I think they're great and I'm not a big country fan.
1,Not what I expected... :-(,"If you want a toy that makes loud noises, this is the toy for you! If you want this toy to actually move and perform the tasks on the controller, forget it. I bought this toy for my 4 year old son. He loves the noise (very loud! ugh), but we can't get it to move (roll across the floor). It doesn't work on either hardwood floors, or on carpet. From the other reviews that I have read (after I bought), NOBODY can get this thing to roll on a floor (you'd think the maker would've tested it before marketing). Oh well, lesson learned. Hope this helps you in your decision."
4,Now I can actually use the two extensions on my 10lb tank tree....,Easy and quick install. No leaks. Worked like a charm. Wish it would have come with something to cover the threads.
1,Thoroughly and Utterly DISGUSTED!,"No Dating?!?! OK! These little virgin girls need to get a serious reality check. Christian ""Josie and the Pussycats"" wanna-bee's. Worn-out lyrics and redundant chord progressions.Yikes- it's a no brainer! DON'T BUY IT!"
4,Good,"The book took the whole two weeks to arrive, but still arrived on time. Used book is in good condition with only some underlining and notes written inside. Great Deal!"
1,overheating camera,the camera was overheating when plugged in for a short period of time and caused a short. I found no customer service number in the instructions and when I look up the manufacturer I was only able to find a toll number somewhere in china. I regret but it seems another defective made in china product.
3,okay for price,"I bought this stroller cause I needed something quick and inexpensive. Its easy to fold down, and I like the color and holds alot underneith but the front wheels wobble alot on the first site of uneven pavement and doesnt recline much."
4,"Help and relief, yes. Cure, no.","Every one has different experiences with psoriasis and the various ""cures"" available. This one works for me where others have not. After 6 months on a modified regimen primarily of milk thistle, B-50 or 100 complex, garlic oil, lecithin and Omega-3/GLA, my skin has actually cleared in most places. I don't take all the supplements LeVan discusses. Being off the regimen for very long allows the lesions to re-form. This book was the first I have found that addresses the underlying biochemical cause of psoriasis (liver malfunction) and gives a non-steroid option for relief. At the very least I can now function in relative comfort and have worn short sleeves in public for the first time in years. Hurrah for this book!"
2,proceed with caution..,"I want to believe that taking mega doses of vitamin supplements will cure Psoriasis, but at the same time my common sense tells me to listen to the previous cautionary post from the nutritionist -- the recommended amounts of supplements in this book seem extreme. And I doubt I'd ever get my son to swallow that many tablets on a daily basis! The book promotes a ""drug-free guide to stopping symptoms of psoriasis"" but doesn't address the toxic effects of some of the recommended vitamins, except to say 'reduce dosage if you experience tingling in your hands' etc. The dietary changes on the other hand, seem very appropriate, but this information is available elsewhere. Anyone wanting to read this book would do well to proceed with caution..."
1,Have you tried the Sun?,"I have news for you, there is no cure. Ask any competent physician, pharmacist, or person tuned in to reality. I have this stuff on my elbows, etc. So what. I offer my own, real life solution to anyone who has this mildly; people with real pain and suffering excluded (hopefully seeing a physician).If you're embarrassed by this you will need: to gain self confidence | long sleeved shirt, pants, or gloves.If it's dry and scaley you will need: moisturizer | ointment of some sort; keep trying, every person is different.If it's in big red spots you will need: try sunlight. Regularly. More the merrier. Seriously."
2,The Winter Lodge,This book had so much useless information in it. The author just dragged on and on about everything that was not Jenny & Rourke. I thought the book was supposed to be about them. I read the beginning of the book at the end of the book. It took forever to get to what the book was about. I won't read anymore from this author.
4,Yummy extravagance,This is a great tasting but pricey coffee. Love most of Coffee Masters flavors but this is a special favorite.
3,I prefer his later works,"I enjoyed M.A. from his crossover/Latin pop English albums and got this several months ago expecting more of the same, just in Spanish. The feel of the music is very different though: not crossover, but a purer salsa feel. He doesn't stand out as much as a pure salsa performer to me as he does in his Latin pop works.If you're looking for salsa, this will be very good, since he's the #1 grossing salsa performer. If you're looking for Latin pop, this isn't the disc for you."
5,SUBLIME LATIN POP,"Marc Anthony's ""From the Beginning"" all-Spanish album is intoxicating, elegant Latin pop. An infectious delight from start to finish, the hits here do not need to be literally understood -- the passion in the voices, (there are two duets, one with a younger J-Lo!!!), there is excitement in the horn-heavy, rhythmic arrangements and there is fire in the love-tinged sentiment of all of the songs. You will find it irresistable in every way; this is a great CD on all levels, and one that deserves to be a part of everyone's pop library."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"After LOVING the first CD and then being VERY disappointed with the second, I was convinced to buy this third CD by the reviews. DO NOT BE FOOLED!! This CD is terrible!! Many of these *songs* are only seconds long!! After listening, you and your child will have no more knowledge of the songs and the composer than you did before you started. That's what was so special about the first CD and what has been sorely lacking in its followers. I'm sending the fourth one back without even opening it. The first CD was an absolute miracle--after that--words fail to describe how bad they are."
1,Coleman Propane Hose and Adapter,"I recently purchased the Paul Jr. Special Edition Coleman Roadtrip Grill. Rather than use the small portable propane canisters that Coleman sells, I wanted to get a hose and adapter to attach to a 20 lb propane tank. Despite the description of the product saying that it's designed to fit Coleman Roadtrip Grills, it was not able to attach to mine! So if you have the Paul Jr., don't get this product! The vendor I bought it from, GearStuff, was great about the return. I emailed them to explain the problem. After getting a return authorization number, I sent it back and Amazon/GearStuff not only refunded the cost of the product but the shipping, too!"
5,Works as expected.,"This hose works as expected. I bought it to have options in using smaller and larger tanks.I'm very pleased. It seems to be a quality product and i have not had any issues.I give it full rating, 5 stars."
5,Does its job,"Not much to review here. Only thing it does is let you use a full size propane tank with grills that use the smaller portable propane tanks.It works, and is long enough to reach."
5,Now we're cooking with gas.,"I own a Colman Gemini tank holder, and a Colman Perfectflow two burner stove, and needed a hose to connect the two. Colman recomended this one, and I bought it through Amazon. Works just like they said it would, and it perfect for what I needed."
2,Didn't last over 4 months.,I bought this in Jan. 2012. Started using it in May by Sept. the adapters quit working while I was on a camping trip. As amazon is the only place I can find the adapter at a reasonable price-I'm buying two this time.
2,Man this one just plain stinks!,"You know, to this day, the best Prototype out of the series are one and three. This one just happens to be the worse. The tracks selection is horrible and just when you think it will start thumping, it all of a sudden slows down once again making you irritated to the max. Some of the tracks are just plain annoying. No good skip on this one and save some money for better comps."
3,Great Film....buyer beware!..Full Screen version!,"Was quite disappointed to find that this DVD version is presented in ""full screen""...and 99 mins ...according to IMDB it's 103 mins.No mention of ""full screen"" in product details.Too bad..great film nevertheless."
3,not worth it!,"when i bought this toy, i couldnt wait 2 open it and put it in my jedi starfighter(sold seperately). but when i opened the cockpit, and bent the figures legs, i couldnt! i then realized that the anakin toy only had five points of articulation! 2 of the arms, one robotic forearm, the neck, and the waist were the only parts that moved!!!!!! 1'd rather buy some cheap candy. this ""toy"" is not worth getting up, parking the car, holding this ""toy"" in line, and spending five whole bucks. its best you not buy this toy,better get anakins yellow custom starfighter."
2,"Cheapest one out there, but gets the job done...","The sign is extremely cheap.The plastic is thick enough, it just doesn't click open or anything.There is no lock in the open position. And it opens at a very tiny angle, making it very awkward.I wouldn't really recommend it, but it does get the job done. And that's all that really matters."
4,fun filled kid entertainment,"This is a great book to transition my 2nd grade boys from picture books to chapter books. We all love ""The Mighty Robot""."
1,Good company/product not as expected,"I returned this product because the sticky orange underside, which is what allows the tripod to stick to ""any surface"", leaves residue wherever you stick it. This was not the quality good i was looking for although the concept was interesting and useful. I would not buy this unless you are only planning on using it on outdoor surfaces. The company was very understanding and offered a full refund."
1,IT [disappointed me],my son got this for christmas and i already had to change the fuse 3 times!... i am so disappointed! you cant even ride it for 2 minutes without the fuse blowing out. i tried to find a number to call the company and they are all in other countries! DO NOT BUY this toy ...
3,"Great hitch pin lock,,,","however the space on coupler lock dogbone was too narrow to lock onto my coupler latch.A friend also tried it on his coupler with the same results.Locks are well built! Just be sure that your coupler falls into that categoryof ""fits most couplers"" in the product desciption."
3,Great art slow plot,This story can easily be done under the AstroCity series. So what is Superman doing in Astrocity?
5,Superbowl DVD,"This product was really good, exactly what we needed. The service was brilliant and the product was shipped from America to England very quickly which was great! Thankyou very much!"
1,Verizon - the WORST SERVICE POSSIBLE,"I have been struggling for more than two months to get Verizon to credit back the duplicate 2nd phone they shipped me when I ordered through Amazon. Amazon has been right there to send them proof the item was returned MULTIPLE times, but Verizon cannot seem to get their act together to save their lives. If this isn't straightened out soon I will cancel the service on the other phone too. Their Customer Service acts like it is trying to help - but results = 0 and I have been endlessly run around and around - with no satisfaction yet. Stay Away - Beware !!! You will be sorry if you ever have to call them."
1,Heterosexuals can change too...,"Happiness doesn't come from trying to change your sexual orientation. Happiness comes from accepting yourself for who you are, gay or straight. Don't waste your time reading a book like this; there's enough ignorance in the world as it is..."
1,This BOOK Doesn't Deserve a Single Star,"Finally ! Something we've all been waiting for : A SYSTEM OF LYING TO YOUR HEART AND THE WAY YOU REALLY FEEL. I personally have fallen in love with another man and for someone to tell me that the amazing feeling I had is an 'error', that there is something WRONG with the way I feel, is a joke. A lot of people are afraid of their homosexual feelings & hold them back because of how socially taboo the idea is - a lot of men completely eliminate the possibility of being with another man strictly because of how looked down upon it is by society. Well screw society and the world and wake up to how you really feel. The concept of this book is a joke. Don't waste your time or money on a book that instructs a person to not be themself because they just can't take it. Only a fool could truly depend on the ""rightful"" opinions that society trys to drive into our mind."
1,"Unloving, Unhelpful, Unspiritual, Unscientific","I decided to look at this book to see if Dr. Laura might have something new and interesting to say about people whose sexuality troubles them. Too bad - there's nothing new here, and nothing that I found helpful. The only really interesting thing about this book is why Dr. Laura is so obsessed with homosexuality - it seems to trouble her an inordinate amount, and she doesn't seem to have a very good understanding of sexuality or relationships. Don't bother with this one!"
1,Family values advice from Dr. Laura?,"How wildly inappropriate for a book on ""family values"" to appear with a forward from Dr. Laura, a woman who's not only been divorced but is estranged from her own mother! What a joke!Yes ... a model of virtue."
4,Hiding Places,"Really enjoyed the story, lot's of twist and unexpected turns. Not many books can keep my interest for three hours but I had a hard time finding a place to stop. Good characters and a fast moving plot. Enjoyed it a lot. John"
1,Why the same old Bette Davis Films??,"I wish that whomever puts these compliations together would show some more imagination. Although they are wonderful films, I have seen Jezebel, Dark Victory ad nauseum on TCM. And why pray-tell did they include that boring, preachy, insufferable Watch on the Rhine on Volume III? What I'd like to see in a Bette Davis compilation is maybe Dangerous, Fog Over Frisco, Ex-lady, The Dark Horse or even the camp classic, Beyond the Forest. Or at least these films should be issued in a single release DVD. Additionally, somebody needs to restore her break though vehicle, Of Human Bondage--all the versions currently in release are awful, and need to be restored. I think Davis's early career needs to be better documented."
2,why Baby Jane &Jezeble,Yes people complain. why not The old Maid/ All This and Heaven Too/ or the other ones that are not out on dvd yet so what if they have extras
3,Great Topper Poor Pillow,"The Topper was great it fit the queen size bed prefect. It's not light weight and feels just like the temperpedic ones. However the pillow well don't expect much, it is light and thin. The pillow is the only thing keeping my review from a 5 star."
1,Very disappointed with this product.,"This is the 3rd memory foam topper we have purchased. The other two lasted several years each. They wore out by eventually taking a permanent set and picking up a slight odor. This one is already gone after only 6 months. It's too soft, definitely doesn't feel like the advertised 6.5 lb density and it had already taken a permanent set after just a few months, which all the other toppers I've owned have not. You bottom out on the foam and both my wife and I are having back pain. I would definitely not recommend this product at all. I'm online shopping for a replacement one right now!"
5,A primer for young minds.,"The NEA will never put this on the suggested reading list for your children, but you should purchase a copy and read it with a youngster several times a year. Loved the language, loved the artwork, loved the message."
4,"Great bread knife, a little short.","We bake most of our bread, sometimes soft crusts sometimes hard, and need a bread knife that cuts through both (without squishing the bread). This knife does a great job; the only drawback is that it's a little short for big round loaves. But you can work around that. We've had it a month or so and don't know how long it will hold up (we use it only for bread), but even if it's only a year, at this price we can get a new one."
4,Deep Haven #2,"This was the second book I have read by Susan May Warren. I enjoyed it very much. It was set around the community of Deep Haven, Minnesota on the shores of Lake Superior. The story of an EMT who completes her training as a nurse after a terrible accident on the job. Anne is a very believable character who obviously suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, although the book doesn't give that specific diagnosis. Anne moves from the big city to do her internship and to heal from her ""accident."" This book shows Anne's struggles to let God heal her and make everything all right once again. I enjoyed this book very much. Susan May Warren is a very good writer and has a lot to offer her readers. You will enjoy this second book in the Deep Haven Series."
2,Disappointed,"I found this product to be a disappointment. We have had our tent for 2 months. The legs are flimsy at the joints, I had to replace 4 of 6 after a wind storm knocked the tent over. It was staked on all corners. The top of the tent collects rain water instead of shedding it. This results in water dumping on anyone opening the screen flap. Several of the clip tabs are showing wear and I expect them to rip before the seasone ends."
3,Could have used a cleaning!,"Product sent very quickly, and was brand new, but it had obviously had been sitting somewhere for awhile. VERY dirty!"
1,Not so good,Just check the nutrition facts on the side of the box (Chocolate Peanut Butter)The 9th ingredient is fractionated palm kernel oil.Just Google this and see how unhealthy this is. Also the are about 45 ingredients and chemicals in one bar.
1,Worst thing I've ever ordered!!,"This DVD was 100% amateurish. I couldn't stand watching more than about 10 minutes of it. The camera movements were so jerky, I got dizzy. The lighting and sound were horrible. I truly couldn't believe my eyes. I was looking for a simple video instruction on different exercises to do with my stretch tubes. Well, a 4 year old could have made a better DVD than this guy! Thank goodness for Amazon's wonderful return policy since I have already received my refund."
3,Nice Portable Guide,"The guide can be carried around easy, however the map is kind of small. Our Hotel provided us with a better map then the one in the guide.One problem was that the opening hours for the musea were incorrect. Archaelogical museum was listed as being open in May till 7:00pm. When we arrived at about 1:30pm we found out that they closed at 3:00pm. They still had 'winter' hours. Opening hours for musea in Athens are kind of random anyway, check before you go."
5,Top 10 Athens,"I have used the Top 10 Series on all major cities ( San Francisco, Paris, London, Athens and many more) They are very accurate, provide an excellent balance between the events, restaurants and the historical sites and history of the city. It's compact, easy to read and easy to search out information. I would love to see it on Kindle so that I could access it easily with links to background information and definitions."
5,Brilliant - Elvis keeps getting better!,"Firstly, don't let the DVD Region 1 status put you off - I am in Australia and this disc played perfectly on my PC, DVD Player and even the PS2! It's wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by Elvis Costello on DVD! It brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me. Elvis Fans will love this DVD featuring his latest music, along with many oldies, it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man! Elvis gives 100% of himself on stage! A must for your music DVD collection."
3,I would have enjoyed more blues....,"For the price, the dvd is worth it... I listen to about 40% of the songs on the dvd.... I like the Emmylou and blues stuff. Most of the other cuts I can do without.. but I don't listen to every cut on every dvd or cd I have in my library...."
5,More than essential...great stuff for reluctant readers,"This book is wildly popular with all kinds of kids. It's already on more than 10 state award lists. Punished! a critical addition to any 3rd or 4th grade language arts program. What better way for kids to learn about wordplay and have fun at the same time? They won't forget, even into their high school years, what oxymorons, anagrams, and palindromes are. Hurray for Lubar!"
2,It was not worth the read,"I had higher expectations, and thought the book was just okay. It took way too long for the main characters to realize their attraction."
3,A good sampler of the detroit scene,"Being a White Stripes fan I had to seek out this album to get their previously unreleased track ""Red Death at 6:14"". Along the way I was introduced to a number of bands from detroit I would have not heard of otherwise. Standout bands on this compilation include The Dirtbombs, Ko and the Knockouts, The Soledad Brothers, The Von Bondies, and Whirlwind Heat.And about the tracks that seem to ""cut off"" after 30 seconds, I have this album on vinyl (yes I have a record player) and the tracks are meant to be like that. I think of them as segues."
3,"Love the music, So-So on the singer","I love the music on this CD. I didn't realize that Rebecca St. James wrote a lot of the songs on this CD and was impressed by the words. But I'm really not fond of her voice. She tends to overdramatize all of her words, and has this extremely annoying habit of adding a little ""uh"" on an upnote at the end of all of her lines. All in all, it's okay.Song to listen to....Quiet you with my Love. This song is powerful."
5,"It gets slashier, but don't hold your breath for Volume 4.","CLAMP's only straight-out BL manga, not suggestive like their others. For some reason, Tokyopop has 4 volumes suggested, but after 2003, CLAMP haiatus'd it to do all that new crap they've been overhauling on. How many series are they working on at the same time? Who knows, maybe volume 4 is creeping it's way slowly through a manga-zine, or it could be years before they pick it up again (I've known some mangaka who didn't drop haiatus for 7 years!) Anyway, each volume is funnier & flirtier than the last. #3 will have you giggling like a hyper kid in a woopie cushion factory.It took me years to notice the resemblance, but Gouhou Drug is eccentially a lite innocent comedy parody of Kazuya Mikekura's Wild Adapter, like how the Diabolo manga is a horror-BL parody of Ban & Ginji from GetBackers."
1,Boredom Rules OK?,Holy smokes..what sort of a guy can write a book like this? I have never read such a boring work written by someone who appears to be such a pompous twit.
3,Check compatibility with CF card,Be sure to verify that your CF card is compatible with the device. My Lexar 8gb 133x cards will not work with my P-4000. A Lexar 8gb 40x card does. The Epson company recognizes this limit if you ask but doesn't do it in the ads.Otherwise it is a pretty good storage device.
5,classic,"various styles, of funk but all ""A1"" a great album , you can hear the funkadelic and ohio players infuences here!"
4,Great Action with Star Power,"I like the way these old war movies were made. You can't beat the original movie but they still have a good enough plot. If you like The Dirty Dozen, also check out Kelly's Heroes and Where Eagles Dare (both with Clint Eastwood)."
4,Looks great especially under proper lighting...,"There are some things that are meant to be used daily and then there are some things which are primarily to be used for decorative purpose. I think this will come under the second category. While it looks great, especially if you have proper kind of lighting the things inside the pillow or the comforter don't feel sturdy and don't feel like something that will handle jumping kids or other activities that involve jumping! I was thinking should I give it three or four stars and decided with four as it is still a good deal considering your bed and windows do get decorated with this one bag and it may cost more to buy something like this from a brick and mortar store. One extra info, you would need double rods to use the window panels as the panels and valance are seperate"
1,"Monte Carlo Carlisle 21-Piece Bedroom in a Bag, King",The bedroom set is very pretty but it has braided rope accented around it that is very rough to your arms. It also does not lay well on the bed. The foam or whatever is inside does not want to lay smooth. I would not purchase this item again.
3,"Not Quality, But Great Look for the Money","This set is beautiful, but not durable. The pillows have tears and some of the ribbon on the bedspread is unraveling already, but great for a guest room or if you won't be giving it alot of wear and tear. I don't expect it to stand up to many washings, but I have a sewing machine and it is quite pretty and can't beat the price."
3,Know what you are getting,"Even thought the stated time delay is adjustable down to 0.03 minutes(1.8sec), I found it impossible to make adjusts less than 30 seconds."
5,Love it!,"I love this CD - I don't know that much about jazz, since I'm from the ""classical"" world, but Ben has a wonderful, clear ""just right"" sound and together with his colleagues make this CD a joy to listen to. The sound of the CD is so natural, you'd think you were sitting in the same room with them, listening to them play."
4,Analysis is great,I like that he has a full page to show the drawing and on the facing page he has a smaller version with commentary. He places capital letters on the drawing so you can see exactly which line or shape he is discussing.
2,Don't buy a ticket for this train (sim),"I looked at the screenshots for this game and read some of the reviews at different sites about this title and decided to buy it. There we're alot of positive reviews, and the graphics looked pretty nice.This is where the title has shortcomings. The biggest gripe about the game is the graphic lag and sound quality. I have a decent machine which surpasses the req's and I get alot of lag. Worse yet, the sound is unbalanced, VERY LOUD at times, then gets quiet. At times the horn sound does not work.A good number of the routes are either a short tutorial or a demo/trial version. The routes that are full do not compare to the length and quality of the routes in Microsoft Train Sim.I liked the game for awhile, but I soon got annoyed with the lag and horrible sound issues. Not a good buy if you want to really see what running trains are like. Buy Microsoft Train Sim. Much better."
3,Trainz: Railroad Simulator 2006,first off it does not take 45 minutes to load.maby 20 at the most depending on computer.2nd its not that hard. It just takes some getting used too.I got it and the CD KEY worked.Installed no problem. It does lag in certain places but im guessing cause it has so much suff on it.overall its OK.
4,"Good, lots of finnicky activities","Definitely NOT for 4 year old! For a older, careful, detail-minded person. Make your own wrapping paper, tree ornaments, paper wreath, etc, color-your-own-gift-tags, write a letter to Santa - lots of details, closely spaced lines to color between. Adult help and direction a must - better titled ""Something To Do (along with an adult for the holidays)"
4,Sexy,"These ladies no how to have fun all day long... Artwork is okay, they are pretty and have nice packages!_! Very wet and arousing scenes with good story to keep you reading."
2,Badly-drawn shemale sausage-fest,"Wow, this was not what I was expecting at all. The girls are all very pretty, but they all have male equipment. They are basically just guys who look like pretty girls-- they don't even have any female anatomy blow the waist.The artwork is poor-- either the artist was unskilled or he was lazy. It is also all in black and white. The comic consists of one scene after another of shemales with various-sized breasts and penises engaged in intimate naughtiness. There are LOTS of climax shots-- nearly every panel. In some of the panels, the ""girls"" are just standing around and squirting. Every page of this comic has a distinct ""gooeyness.""I'd describe the plot, but really there isn't one. Unless you are just REALLY into shemales, let this one pass you by."
1,Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars,"This book was very limited as far as various makes of guitars. It didn't have any price guides on any of the things listed.I would think that would be the main information anyone owning a vintage guitar or other musical equipment would be most interested in. This book was useless to us. I wish we could return it. Thank goodness we ordered ""The Offical Vintage guitar Magazine Price Guide 2003"" It included everything any collector would want to know!!!"
2,Grain of Salt,"I found this reference to be riddled with ommissions and inaccuracies. The Rickenbacker bass section contains errors in almost every model. A simple check of the Rickenbacker website would have corrected the majority of inaccuracies. Production dates were the most obvious. Now if the book was to be filed under ""fiction""..."
5,Living in the real world.,"This book is an awesome work of fiction by Irwin Baxter author of an excellent end-time Bible study and host of the show ""Politics and Religion"". Anyone who studies Biblical prophecy should check out his unique perspective on the end-times. Biblical prophecy is not a fantasy but the Word of God. Seek to know and understand what is really going on in the world."
4,Women in the Viking Age,"I just recently purchased this book and read it in 2 days. It seems to keep to facts, not opinions (unless stated). It was fairly easy to read (only a few ""dry"" places) and it gave it's sources for everything so more reading on the subject is possible. I found it fascinating."
2,Basketball System,"The order took six weeks to ship. After I removed the parts from the box I noticed the backboard was broken. The return went smooth as they resent within a few days. However, the rim is rather cheap and one of the net holders broke off within the first month."
3,Fine But Not All Parts Fit,"Read entire directions before assembly -- at least the entire page at a time -- as a critical note about lining up the pieces of the pole came at the bottom of a page ... after the directions to assemble. Thank goodness for WD-40. We couldn't get the ball return to attach on both sides with its parts, so we rigged it. Can't get the corner guards to fit onto the backboard, either. Do like how easy it is to adjust height, but wish we could get it even lower for our kids."
2,Only works on some vegetables,"I had high hopes for this knife since all my previous knives were cheap. However, it didn't deliver. It is good for slicing things like potatoes or onions, but if a vegetable has a skin, such as a tomato or bell pepper, it does not cut through the skin very well. I ended up getting another knife, and I only use this one on occasion."
5,One of the most practical trading books,"The third edition adds approximately 150 pages to this insightful text.The original editions focused more on what to do with existing longer-term holdings. The new chapters on using chart patterns and candlesticks as well as determining when and at what price to buy and sell are more focused on the short to intermediate trader.As before, the author gives many examples and tips along the way. He now includes a chapter on risk control and money management."
4,caused action,"The book was very helpful.The examples make it easy to take action and so it encouraged me to do what I knew I should be doing anyway.It has been a profitable book for me.The reason I withheld the fifth star was that the book, despite its current date, was written at a time whan volatility was considerably higher than it is today. Thus it exagerates the amount that you can get from option sales. But, while you may not do as well as he implies, the principles are sound and particularly work well in a flat market such as you usually get in late spring and summer."
3,Typical breed book,"We bought this book when purchasing our corgi puppy. It's a decent book, though nothing different from any other book on the breed."
4,Another Gloria concert for us to enjoy.,"I tell ya, we are lucky aren't we. If you are a Gloria fan, then you certainly haven't being short changed in the DVD department.Another Gloria concert for the collection. This one is beautiful.Great stage, tons of musicians and a great campy Miami finale, which I loved.If you want to see a great concert DVD then this is for you. With a few songs from her new album and a lots from her back catalogue, it all adds up to a great show and one you will remember always.Highly recommended. Enjoy"
1,This Review is for the price shown above.,"Please read this and don't pay 119 for 3 packages of swiffer wet clothes! I don't know where these people get off charging that much, but if you just do a search, you will see amazon offers the exact same product, for only about 24.00."
4,still arrives leaking,"Amazon still hasn't quite figured out how to ship these... mine arrived with one case broken open, although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag."
5,Jim Henson's The Story Teller,"This DVD is an absolute delight. The series was shown on Channel 4 in the early 80's and my three children were enthralled with it. We video taped each one and they watched them until they knew every word by heart. I have tried before to aquire them on DVD because the video quality is not very good. I was delighted to find that it is available now in the US, although I don't know why you can't get it in the UK. My granddaughter watches it now with all the rapture that her mother had when she was a little girl. Jim Henson's puppets are delightful, but Anthony Minghella's screenplay is what makes it. It is sheer poetry. I would recommend it for children but it has just as much adult appeal. My children, who are all grown up now, were thrilled when it arrived and have all enjoyed watching it again. Why is it not available in the UK? The ""Greek Myths"" series is a little disappointing, possibly because it was not written by Minghella and lacks the beautiful use of language."
4,A Must-have for Jim Henson Fans,"These series are excellent, and you really can't beat the price (two complete series in one set for less than $15!). I didn't watch them when they were on HBO, but I really thought they were well done when I put them on after it was delivered. They are interesting short stories, some I was familiar with, most I was not. My favorite was the Soldier and Death. And I must say it was really fun realizing who all the actors in the different stories are. For Harry Potter fans out there, a lot of the cast are in these two series! I definitely recommend them to anyone who enjoys fantasy and Jim Henson's creations."
5,Stories from around the world touched by Jim Henson's genius,"This series is a collections of Jim Henson's interpretation of classic myths and fables. Each is unique and seperate. There is no continuity to the collection, as opposed to Greek Myths, which allowed for much more creative spirit. Equally as entertaining and educational, The Storyteller Collection is for a little more mature audience (young adult)."
3,Just ok for me,"This is one of those books where you know the end after you read the first 10 pages.To me the main characters seem more of a cheap copy of Elizabeth and Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. I could not understand in the beginning of the book why our heroine Meg Grantham tagged Viscount Reversby as proud and arrogant, when he did nothing while in her company to be judge so harsh.The dialogs where to simple and did not ad any spice to the book.The only thing that kept me reading was ""The great secret"" that Meg was sharing with Anne (her best friend, and wife of, now widow, Viscount Reversby).Once you past the page 60 and her secret is revealing, you don't have anything else interesting left in the book. Also the secret changes the image of pure and innocence (witch I found so charming in regency romance) into more modern mentality."
1,"""HOUSE OF DISSAPOINTMENT""",OMG this CD SUUUUUUUCKS!!!! the only songs i like are:*Bounce*Chilsthats it. the rest of the tracks sucks. I would recommend B5 cd over this weak album and B5 album suck too. so my original rating is 00000.5 starz for this weak peice of crap. PPLE DONT WASTE UR MONEY!! I ADVISE YOU TO BURN THE CD
2,I'm not listening to you people anymore!!!!!,"Seriously, the only reason I bought this Album was because most of ya on here said that this CD was good. Well guess what, IT'S NOT!!!!!!!! There's only two good songs on here. ""Bounce"" and ""Tight"". Thats it. Only people who listen to pop could possibly find this group unique. Sorry, thats what I think and I'm not changing it.I give them a 2 out of 5 for effort. pff..At least they tried.Note: I'm ""13"", not under."
4,Functional Phone,"A cellphone for an active blue-collar guy like me must be, first and foremost, functional. It can't be fragile or too small. I was initially excited to hear about the features of the G'zOne and its practicality. However, I'm disappointed in the phone's multi-functional navigational keys and alphanumeric keypad. The buttons should be more pronounced or raised to accomodate the thicker fingertips of a man's hand. It has been a nuisance hitting the wrong button each time. In addition, I prefer a phone that has a 24-hour digital clock as opposed to a AM/PM one."
2,TOO SMALL,"Bowls are too small. I dont know how you could mix anything of volume in them. It seems like it should have been a set of 5 and the big 5th bowl is missing.Also came in a cheap, flimsy box. Had I been in a brick and mortar store and saw the box, I would not have bought"
3,"Maybe quick, but not for a new quilter","I am new to quilting, and am trying to help my church make quilts for charity. Working full time, I thought this might be a great help. Maybe these are quick quilts for those with a lot of experience, but it's not quick for my purposes. It may have also been my mistake by equating ""quick"" to ""easy""."
1,NOT O.K. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sees Behind Trees(SBT) is a story about a Native American 13 year old boy who evidently can not see very well. He tries to succeed in a challenge that will turn him into a man.He has to shoot an arrow at a target. It actually turns out the real assignment is to see with your ears.SBT finds out he has this power and uses it to find lost things.He then has to take on the biggest task of his life.I didn't think it was a good book, infact I'd rather watch reruns of Barney 6 hours strait."
3,Strength Inside,"This fictional book, Sees Behind Trees, by Michael Dorris was published in 1996 by Hyperion. This story shows the life of a nearsighted boy named Walnut as he transforms into a young man.This takes place in many different settings including a Native American Tribe village and a magical land of water. Walnut tells the story of himself as a boy receiving his adult name, Sees Behind Trees, which he got for his special talent to use his other senses and ""see"" better than anyone else. His abilities take him on journey only he can accomplish.This book is not that great except for the poetic and powerful metaphors and similes which illustrate this book and engage your imagination. Other than that, the book is not very exciting.The ending isn't suspenseful but still leaves you wondering what will happen next. I think this book is okay and if you want a touching, adventurous book Sees Behind Trees is the one you should get."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,by Micheal DorrisThis book was realistic fiction/fantasy. It was not very well written. Dorris overused similies and metephors. It's about an indian boy who can hjardly see.This story takes place in california when the white men hadn't come yet. Nobody is realkly telling the story. THe main character is a near sighted indian kid whos kinda psychic.The mood of this book is depressed and annoying.the plot is completely pointless he finds this place loses his elder freind and walks home.'the storie is boring i personetely didn't like this book what so ever The story is not engaging i swear i almost died of bordom readind it.if the auther had a point i'd have no idea what it was. i would only recomend this book to an indian kid really into his culture.
2,Seeing Without Eyes,"In 1996 Michael Dorris wrote a pretty good book called, Sees Behind Trees. It goes slowly and doesn't have much excitement until the end. It is about a boy who can't see fully and uses his ears to find objects that his friends want him to find. His talent is to not see and to find things every time he wants to. He is also trying to get his name which shows his tribe that he is a man.If you think that you would like to read this book I will warn you that it goeas really slow and the chapters are really long.I think that this book was OK but I wouldn't read it again."
1,Cropped HDTV,"The only real point of getting this TV is for HD through the HDMI input. Unfortunately, the right and bottom of the video are severely cropped, making it basically unusable for HD. Other Philips HD models have this same exact problem, but I have never seen anything this bad with any other brand."
1,"Terrible, absolutely horrible","It doesn't deserve the title final fantasy. Sure it carried the 'crystals' theme, and a chocobo here and there, but the story, characters, and plot development were bland. The animation quality needed some work; characters were not very deep and plot was paper-thin. Simply put, it was too short to develop any character associations or plot development that I found crucial in many other anime titles. Terrible, absolutely terrible."
3,1994,"This movie is quite a waste of money, it's okay for not having CGs or having poor animation, this movie is made in 1994!It'll cost billions just to make CG like today a second long. The story is terrible! It is just too stupid! Sorry Square, I don't want to say it, but it is terible.I don't recommend this movie to anyone."
4,I laughed so hard....,This was a very funny movie. The major plot is that the world is in havoc because 3 of the 4 crystals are gone... This is a must buy for those who like a good laugh.. but if you a diehard Final Fantasy freak then you might not like this as much cause it doesn't follow the game... I suggest you buy this one... it still makes me laugh...
2,Not as good as #1....,"I picked up the book just to see what Alejandro was up to. That storyline was far more interesting to me than the 2007 stuff. Ms. Benson could not (in my humble opinion) recapture the thrill, fun, humour, sadness of the first one. One thing that I appreciated though (in both books), I did not know what to expect. If I made a guess, Ms. Benson steered me in another direction. In other words, Ms. Benson is not a predictable writer. Anyway, Ms. Benson, if you're reading this, lay off the language and sex. There's enough of it in my real world."
3,Compelling but it doesn't stand on its own,"A word of warning to anyone who might pick up this book - this is a sequel, a fact not acknowledged on the cover, or for that matter anywhere at all on the book.The story moves compellingly between two doctors in two centuries. The historical tale stands on its own but the contemporary one needs more explaining. Frustrated with cryptic references that could only be understood if I went to the first volume, I've stopped reading until I can get a copy of The Plague Tales."
2,"BRING BACK WATCHERS, MR KOONTZ","IN SEIZE THE NIGHT, KOONTZ'S LIGHT CHALLENGED HERO AND HIS SURF DULLED BUDDIES TAKE ON THOSE ELDER GODS OF HP LOVECRAFT. GREAT CTHULHU MUST BE SHAKING LIKE A JELLY (HE DOES THAT ANYWAY, THOSE TENTACLES YOU KNOW) ONCE AGAIN, ORSON THE TALKING COMMUNICATING DOG IS THE BEST DRAWN, MOST SENSITIVE AND INTERESTING CHARACTER OF THE BUNCH. THE HERO'S BUDS PROFESS THEIR UNENDING LOVE FOR HIM, AND I HAD THE URGE TO SEE HOW WELL HE WOULD TAN. BRING BACK WATCHERS, VIVA STEPHEN KING, DOWN WITH DEAN KOONTZ."
5,Dean is back to his bad old mind numbing best.,"This is Dean at some of his best, lately his books have been lacking in substance, and the sheer ""can't put this book down till I have finished"" attitude he has displayed in the past. This one on the other hand was a one day read, to put it bluntly, I missed a day's work to be sure I could finish it without putting it down. I am positive that this trillogy would have to be THE gold mine for Hollywood, if Dean would ever sell the rights to it =) I personally can't wait for the final installment, and when it arrives, I can assure you that I will yet again be missing another day's work."
3,"Decent, but not what I expect when I pick up a...","novel by Koontz. This was an okay read, but he switches writing styles in this book. He becomes a bit ""wordy"" and hard to read.His character, Chris Snow, is fully developed and fleshed out in great detail, almost too much. However, Koontz still displays his trademark witty repartee and does a ""good"" job.Not an easy read or a first-timer for new fans, but still an enjoyable ride."
2,"slow,not his best","Have been a Koontz reader for years, found this one to be slower, hard to follow at times, not the usual can't put it down quality. A very slow starter. If you are an avid Koontz fan, read it but otherwise easily skipped."
1,this is dean koontz???,"man i love dean koontz...his books keep me spellbound till the end...but this book was so boring and it didn't hold my attention like ""the bad place"" or ""lightning"" (definitly two of his best). whens his next one coming out anyway?"
3,Koontz,"After struggling through all of the detail in this book and looking forward to the climax / ""homecoming"" - Koontz left me empty. Too many plots left with loose ends. Koontz also rushed through portions of the book which, in my opinion, deserved more sentimentality."
2,Disappointment from Koontz,"Koontz really let me down with this one.The whole effort feels overly contrived and seems to be a B movie script gone wrong. Having read over 20 of Koontz's novels and having really liked about 16 of them, this and the novel preceding it both were really a chore to read. The main characters did not really interest me. The mystery aspect lacked in suspense. The end of the book is nothing new.Only read this if you need to cross it off your Koontz list..."
3,Less than a Masterwork.,"This offering is very readable; a decent plot with believable (usually) characters. Given the creativity the author put into the text, one would think he'd give the setting a better name than ""Moonlight Bay."" The ""demons"" bit is an ""overdone"" bit, though I found the ""sideways in time"" idea intriguing, as well as the intelligent, though murderously depressed, apes. Most of the descriptive passages are miss-able, as are a good many of the main character's musings on his ""condition."" I had to scan past them after the first , oh, dozen or so. One reviewing body calls it ""His Masterwork."" If this is it, keep me away from his lesser works."
4,Koontz does it again,"This was a very good book. The characters and events were so well thought out and portrayed: I felt sincere pity for 'Bighead' after his scene; I read through the ending in this dream-like state that I would be in if that was actually happening to me. I also really like those sort of things where you find out where a certain myth or legend came from, in this case, demons and hell. A great read, a must for any Koontz fan."
1,Bad Book,"This book was recommended to me by my friend. It is the second in the series. When I read it, I found out hwo wrong he was. It was way too long, and didn't have the suspense of any of his other books. He also spent way too much time describing unimportant things. Overall, a poorly written book."
5,A must for every seeker of truth!!!,"This is the book to have if you are truly interested in a good formation in Magic, Theurgy,the Kabbalah and the western Traditions in general, but don't know where to start...The author is undeniably an Initiate, and all the people who have read this book stand in awe before the value and clarity of his teachings...This book is extremely practical...the second part provides highly effective rituals for evolution, while the first builds a serious and clear foundation on the theories of Western Tradition...Those who have enough of the complexity of the Golden Dawn rituals will find a haven in this book...I have personally read it more than 50 times and throughout the years it has proven to be a very good reference book.Enjoy !Tricio."
3,Winged Victory,"The book is somewhat difficult to follow as it was written with many terms and slangs of the era that I was not familiar with. The accounts of life at the flying squadron were very interesting and the book was an enjoyable read, if not for the unfamiliar words."
5,If you can't handle the simple truth don't buy this book!,After reading the first few chapters of Discipline I quickly realized that this could be a bit much for me to swallow. Kern's view of the world is very regimented. It's like being in boot camp.Did I just flush my money down the toilet for this book? As I kept reading I realized that he's telling it like it is. It's a very simple read with a very simple message. Nothing good comes without a price tag. The price tag is the sacrifice one must make to make their life more efficient. We all know that we need discipline to succeed but most of us think that discipline is an ugly four-letter word.Before I purchased this book I read all the reviews. In my opinion the negative reviews are from people that want an easy and quick fix for all their problems in life.It's really up to you to make a difference in your life. Don't bother going to seminars and buying more self-help books - PUT YOUR DUES IN and get some discipline into your life.
3,Kindle version apparently wasn't even proofread,"I bought the kindle version. It looks like it was simply OCR'd and no diligent human being bothered to edit and correct it. Mistakes abound which may cause some confusion to newcomers to French. For the debutantes, I would steer clear of the digital version until they clean up their act."
4,Good buy!,"I think this book is very helpful and a very nice source if you do not have much time to study French with classes etc... It is very small and its advantage is that you can easily locate what you are looking for and especially since it provides you with the literal meaning of what you are saying but in English. This latter part has been really helpful for me since I can compare the English grammar with the French one. For example, a book might tell you what how to use the direct object... but if you are not even sure what a direct object is in your own language the whole explanation may not make much sense. I would definitely advise buying it."
3,Nice little football game,The instruction manual is very lacking. So lacking that it should not have been included. The other problem is the Sprint Nextel ads that show up during the game. It feels like I have purchased spam for fifty bucks. Over all a fairly nice game.
4,Is this Game Coop,I have found that Madden 07 is only co-op on PS2. I actually sold my xbox 360 because most of the games were built for online play and not for 2 people playing cooperatively on the same console. I have looked all over and can't find anything that will tell me if Madden for Wii makes it where you can play on the same team with your friend in franchise mode. IF ANYONE KNOWS...PLEASE LET ME KNOW.........THANK YOU
4,"Amazing, Control, Breathtaking, Epic, One Flaw, 4.5","Breathtaking, Great, Speech Less, Best Madden Yet PERIOD. The game is amazing and by the far the throwing is the best and the running is pretty amazing too. Swatting down the ball under your control.Priceless, The game is SO much better because YOU do more instead of the computer/Wii(like in previous Madden's). Everything seemed perfect, until I had to kick a field goal. I've tried and tried and can't seem to make a single field goal or kick the ball off behind the 30 yard line. It just kills the game. If I could get the hang of kicking I would beat my brother every time but instead, I lose. Long story short, Kicking is REALLY important for the enjoyment of the game and winning. A final note if I could I would rate this game with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating."
1,Porqueria rock,"Otra vez la cara del rock peruano se ve esuciado por roqueritos cojudos como Pedro, les advierto de que no compren este disco de porqueria ya que seria una perdida de plata. Les recomendaria gruppos peruanos como estos: Leuzemia, Voz propia, Mar de copas, Dolores delirio, G3, Cementerio club, y muchos mas. Salvemos el rock peruano y no el de porqueria que hace Pedro. Asi que ya estan advertidos amigos. Le puse una estrella por que no aceptaba estar en blanco ya que no merece nada!"
3,A good single ... but,"A good single, but now that the Pixies ""B-Sides"" has been released, skip this, and get the full length ""B-Sides"". It has this entire single on it, plus all the other Pixies singles throughout the years."
3,"Heartwarming, but not enough action","This book really shows compassion between fellow men, but doesn't have enough content. This is a great read for lovers of little house on the prairie, but as a boy I don't suggest it."
1,Not good,"""losing Aaliyah"" is supposedly a dvd documentary about Aaliyah's life and a tribute to her. Well, this really isn't. It is poorly made. Plus The Narrator couldn't get the names of her movies and songs correct. ""Mistress of the Damned?"" that ain't right. The DVD in ""Aaliyah ultimate"" (ASIN : B0007S6892) is a much better documentary. Avoid ""Losing Aaliyah"" at all costs"
1,Poor Tribute,"It is gr8 that a tribute dvd and vhs was made 4 Aaliyah, but This 1 isn't all that gr8. 1st of all, they called ""Queen Of The Damned"" - ""Mistress Of The Damned"" And ""We Need A Resloution"" - ""Resolution."" There were no interviews w/ Aaliyah or her family and friends. VH1's ""Behind The Music"" Aaliyah episdoe was much better. They should release that on video and dvd. Don't waste ur money on this dvd or vhs.Aaliyah Lives On 4eva! Rest In Peace!!!!!!!"
1,Just Awfully Mean!!!!,"This is the meanest DVD towards hip-hop's princess Aaliyah, who tragically died. The least they could have done was to find people that said positive things about her rather than random people calling her a slut. I don't think anyone, dead or alive, deserves to be remembered like this. Just horrible and extremely mean!!!!"
5,Irish praise,"Tracy's book includes so much of what I think it takes to be an Irish American - the humor, the wisdom, the sarcasm, the hard-work, the struggles. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in the Irish culture or looling for inspiration. Then again, I may be a bit biased, as Tracy Quinn is my twin sister!"
2,Sloppy research. The Met deserved better.,"I know a lot about the history of the Met, and any journalist with access to a library card could have checked name spellings, debut and farewell dates and roles sung at the Met. The innacuracies in this book exceed my ability to list them all! The author has Joan Sutherland retiring in 1984 (it was 1989). They have her cancelling a production of SEMIRAMIDE, which in fact was taken away from her when she cancelled ABDUCTION, giving them over a year's notice. They list singers singing roles they never gave at the Met. The date inaccuracies are legion. If you want half warmed-over gossip with no relation to actual reality, this is the book for you."
1,Line Dancing the Country Way 2 Pack,I was very excited to receive the videos but very dissapointed after viewing them. The dances are not the newer ones that you see being done today. The instruction was good but would have been better if the music played longer than a minute. The video did not give me the opportunity to practice the steps while watching the dancers for very long. Am I sorry that I bought it? Yes!
2,Disappointed,"Less than what I expected, at best a trip down memory lane from when I was dancing about 10 years ago. Generic music played in the background (not the music that the dance was named for), inconsistent terminology for the dance steps, not evenly paced; some parts were over done, some were rushed through. Spending more time on fewer dance steps would have been better."
1,TINY Bookstand,"After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs. Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was. This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back. Any of my school books are not stably supported. I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages. Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00). Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you."
2,Comfortable but not well-made,"These are very comfortable - especially for people with low back pain. However, I was very disappointed with how they were made. I wear them for work daily, and I work in an office, so most of my day is sitting and brief walking. The black covering on the heels and soles is peeling off and it looks really crummy. I invested extra money into buying this particular brand because I thought they would be well-made and comfortable. They are definitely comfortable, but I'm really, really disapointed with the peeling on the soles. I'm not sure if I would purchase another pair."
1,Backtesting doesn't work in the future,"The fundamental problem of this highly simplistic and simple-minded work is that the author utilized back-tested methods to supposedly demonstrate how easy it is to make above average returns in the stock market.This approach, ironically, is central to that used by so many investment newsletters which Mr. Sheard and his brethren have been so vocal in criticizing.The author's lack of background in the investment field and credentials should also be a huge red warning flag to neophytes likely to blindly follow his suggestions."
4,Will force me to overhaul my investments,"I've only read the first 3 chapters so far, but it looks like a winner. I'll report back in a year!"
5,Excellent Album,I enjoyed this album very much. The Bee Gee's are still an amazing musical talent and are FINALLY getting the recognition they have always deserved!
4,Good buy for iPhoto lovers,My husband and I purchased iLife for our OSX about a month ago and have been very pleased with the ease of use and all of the new features that come with it for iPhoto.
2,If you are upgrading from Iife 06 to 08 - DONT do it,"I got very disappointed with the new improvements... to expensive for what you get.On I Movie, you CANT transfer the movie to iDVD with one click anymore, now you need to export the movie as Quicktime format and then import it on iDVD..... and like this, other anoying new things.I just downgraded to iLife 06."
2,Read before you buy. A step backwards in user control.,"Customers are well advised to read reviews of ILife 08. It is a large step backward with IMovie. Customers used to previous versions of IMovie will be disappointed with loss of simple control. Two examples. First, you cannot alter audio volume within clips. You can only affect the overall volume, rather than making some parts silent, quieter, or louder. Second, you cannot change the length of transitions, for example crossfades. Preset speeds, no alterations. The software will be simple, I guess for some, but is a real step backward.IDVD is not much better. There are 7 new themes, all are very simple, with limited spots to insert video or photos.IPhoto seems better. I like the way pictures can be ordered by events. Pretty slick.I'll be using my older version of IMovie, and the new version of IDVD and IPhoto. Doesn't seem worth the money though for the huge loss of functionality in IMovie."
3,iPhoto and iWeb rock. iMovie needs work,"Short and sweet:iPhoto: They added some new features that are great. Photo editing capabilities and photo management work well.iWeb: A major improvement. Could not be happier with it.iDVD: A few more templates, nothing too earth shattering but the new templates are nice.GarageBand: I don't use it but it looks real pretty.iMovie: They changed the software to much it's unrecognizable as iMovie. When you update a program, you should add, not take away. Some of the new features are nice but not at the expense of losing so many others. Very surprised at Apple.When they (hopefully) fix iMovie, it will be even worth it. If you use iWeb, it's DEFINITELY worth it."
4,"Not as full of features as other products, but great for the price!","iLife is a great way to get all your media needs for a great price. They work flawlessly on your Mac (of course) and have an intuitive look. I wouldn't replace my audio program with GarageBand just yet, but mostly these programs are well thought out and integrated with each other."
4,My Life,"I really like this product. I love iWeb, creating web sites is made simple with it. The organization in iPhoto is something that needed to be done a long time ago."
3,New iMovie stinks,"I usually love apple's upgrades but this one is stinky! The new iPhoto, iDVD and Garageband are cool but not tremendously different but the new iMovie took a step backwards! I really kinda hate it. It's so dummied done it's rather useless. I guess it's time for me to move on to Final Cut Pro."
2,Horrid Downgrade,"iMovie 08 threw away nearly all of the good features of iMovie 06. The only reason to use it is that it finally lets you import video from some hard drive video cameras. On one of my machines it just crashes on startup. See other reviews for the details of the great features Apple threw away when they made this ""upgrade"".One of the great reasons to use a Mac just disappeared."
3,Rock Your World,"Well, it may move it a little...This one is better than Vol. 1 but still contains some filler. Hardcore techno fans will enjoy it, but it's no classic. If you dig hard and powerful techno, then I have to recommend Mr.Deviant's ""Techno Obsession"". Now that, will Rock Your World"
5,Another EXCELLENT Book,I wanted to re-read The Stone Bull. I barely remember it except that I really liked it. It arrived on schedule and is in great condition. Thank you!
5,Delicatessan are a great british band eerie and depressing,"Delicatessans second effort ""Hustle Into Bed"" is a glorious album. It is the epitome of all depressing music,and the vocals by Nick Carlill are awesome. The first album ""Skin Touching Water"" is also a very excellent recording and is worth checking out as well. In my opinion you just can't get any better than this.Frank Kulaga-Music Expert"
3,Jazz Casual - Art Pepper and Vince Guaraldi & Bola Sete,I ENJOYED THE PART WITH BOLA SETE AND VINCE GUARALDI BUT THE ART PEPPER PART WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME. HE DID NOT DO ANY STANDARDS AND THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL WAS TOO ADVANGUARD FOR ME.
4,typical soccer drill cones,"Do what they are supposed to do, nothing special, nothing wrong. would buy again. best price i found. Still could be better price."
4,Ultra smooth,"This is Les Brown in the latter half of the 1950's so you should be aware the material in The Les Brown Story are remakes ""in today's sound"" (and that was true, although the liner info and even the disc itself says stereo/mono- meaning the South Pacific part is stereo while the Les Brown Story would be mono.) A pleasant surprise is that The Les Brown Story is stereo, too. This gets four stars only because I know some will only want this artist's 1940's originals. But they'll be missing a real treat. This is a splendid disc. I bought it because I knew this would be a great pairing- the South Pacific pieces are played with all the smoothness and flair you could want. Les Brown fans will want this. Its all good and thoroughly recommendable."
2,Bad Graphics,"This DDR game works, but the 8-bit graphics are very ""Pac-Man"" like, and basically are little dancing panda bears that move like a pac man. If your daughter has already used the version for play station or x box, she'll be disappointed with this for sure."
1,Misleading,"The description of this game states ""50 stereo quality songs"" which is completly inaccurate the graphic are horrible the songs sound like crap and the arrows only register 1/2 the time. There is no type of score keeping If you are looking for something that is anything like DDR this is not for you..TV Plug & Play Dance Pad w/ 50 songs"
3,Paintballs,"They are paintballs, so paint comes out of these balls. Overall it's a great product, thanks for the deal! And for that I thank you."
1,crappy paint,First off...the paint balls were two different colors and were both worng. second problem was that they blow up in your gun so easily..dont buy less you like cleanin your barrel!!!
3,ur getting ur money's worth,"great for playing around. if kept in warm climate, the paintballs tend to get moist, and sticky."
5,My Favorite Guide,"Sorry to say, but I guess I own all or most of the guides out there. I can't resist. The All-Music Guide is my hands-down favorite. I can't agree with everything I read in it, but dollar-for-dollar, this single book has saved me a small fortune in buying CDs. Great in the bathroom too."
2,This book tries too hard!,"This AMG book tries to cover too many genres and fails--though not miserably--in its attempt. I'd recommend more genre-specific books (like the Musichound series) for anyone who wants reliable, in-depth information. This book might satisfy a CD-buying novice, but not much more."
3,"Same quality as Hydra, three good songs, forget the rest","There are enough good songs to make the disc worth buying, but there's also a distinct B-side smell to a lot of the material that hasn't worn off in the two months I've owned this disc. Mindfields isn't likely to be one of those albums that I will eventually be able to listen to all the way through.Buy the disc for Cruel, Caught in the Balance and Better World. If you like any of the rest of it, then it's a bonus.I really miss Steve Porcaro."
1,A TRAIN THAT DOES NOT TRAVEL - FOR $25-$50,"I LOVE ALL GEOTRAX TRAINS - EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE. I HAVE 4, AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAME WITHOUT A REMOTE. $25-$50 IS RIDICULOUS, THE TRAIN DOES NOT RUN. IT IS BATTERY OPERATED JUST TO MAKE A SOUND AND LIGHTS!!"
4,Grandson Loves It,Our five year old grandson likes playing with this toy. It is a good addition to his other Geo Trax toys.
5,WOW!!,"Every Judy fan has to be jumping with joy in response to this fabulous release. Waiting for The Letter and Alone, though!"
3,"Good, could have been better","There are some good songs on this cd and the more experimental tracks work pretty well. To my older ears, Radiohead sounds like Pink Floyd for the new century. Thom Yorke does not always use his great voice to good effect - there's just too much caterwauling going on here. Also, this cd is only about 44 minutes - too short for a full price release. They should have either added more tracks or cut ... list price.Three and a half stars for the material less a half star for its brevity."
4,Singalong with Radiohead,"On first listen, I really thought Radiohead might have reached the end of a great run, and that they had finally sacrificed musical appeal, in the name of originality.But I also thought that about KidA and OK Computer. And so I listened to Amnesiac again, and I have to concede it is another great album. It contains their trademark - originality, whilst retaining enough of the Radiohead identity to satisfy fans like me.It's too early to say which tracks appeal to me the most or why, I just know I am going to enjoy finding out."
2,Self Indulgent Art Rock,"Entertainment Weekly hit the nail on the head comparing Radiohead to Yes in the 70's. This is a band that, after OK Computer, has abandoned traditional rock constraints of song structure and melody. There's a place for this -- challenging ""art rock"" music has always had a market, and the positive reviews here point that out -- but if you caught on to Radiohead with The Bends or OK Computer, I'll bet the odds are higher that you'll feel put off by this CD.That said, Pyramid Song is a glorious exception on this CD. Had that song been representative of the direction they took with this album, this might have been Radiohead's second masterpiece. As it is, in ten years, nobody will remember this CD."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this one after reading some interviews with Thom where he said it would be more guitar driven. Anyway, it sounds like there are less guitars than on Kid A. Not that that is a bad thing, just not what I was expecting. I like about half of the songs ok, and the rest are take it or leave it, in my opinion. I think Kid A is an awesome record - this one is half as good. Can anyone please explain Life In a Glasshouse??? God-awful. Sometimes I think Radiohead is messing with us..."
2,The Dissenting Opinion,"This album is pretty much a collection of throw-away tracks that deserve to be b-sides, with a few exceptions. Songs like ""Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"" will probably only appeal to those who enjoyed ""Fitter Happier"" off of OK Computer. For me, they're just songs I always skip over. Overall, this album feels less coherent and cohesive than either of their previous two. The saving graces of this album are the first single, ""Pyramid Song"" (a hauntingly beautiful song and video), and the tracks ""Knives Out"" and ""Dollars & Cents"". If only they would've thrown those 3 tracks on to Kid A, then it would've been the equal of the classic OK Computer. I'm mildly disappointed, but still glad to have a fresh set of tracks to digest."
5,inspiring,"i had began working with a huge radiohead fan a few weeks before this came out. aside from creep, which i always thought was ok, i never really heard them. i was an 18 year old, rage against the machine kinda kid. so when this came out i bought it, along with kid a and ok computer. though they were all great, i was especially hooked on amnesiac. i sorta get why so many people hate this one, but then i don't. i guess ya just have to be the kinda person who can see past the poppy, bouncy westernized, force-fed corprate music.i spent basically the rest of that summer and fall, on my bed, with no lights but a strobing blacklight, pen and paper, and this cd along with tool's live disc looped. i wrote alot of dark stuff that needed to come out, and ultimatly helped me become a more rounded person. so i guess what i'm sayin is this is one of those things ya really feel, more than ya hear. all ya gotta do is stop and feel."
5,Are you a Radiohead?,"Are you a Radiohead? If so do not buy this album... you won't get it. Contining where Kid A left off this album is a remarkable masterpiece.Radiohead have done it and as with Kid A this is not music as the rest of the world knows it, it is the sound of the present and the future as one. Challenging and diverse, lush and sweeping but most of all masterfully complete. Remove one phrase and there would be diminishment.If you love music listen to this until you understand.... If you do not then I suggest you turn on the radio. :-) dxx"
2,The king has no clothes!!,"This disc just plain [stinks]. You'll listen to it once or twice and then not much after that. I give it 2 stars because it's somewhat interesting. You could use some of the material for background sounds for your video art class project, I guess. Certainly don't buy the expensive limited edition version. Wait a bit, there's gonna be tons of these at your local used record store."
1,I wish I was suffering from amnesia when it comes to this.,"This is really bad. I mean on par with Pearl Jam's Riot Act. Well, no. Not even Riot Act is that bad and that album sucks holy bull balls! Though, maybe Thom Dorke and Eddie Mueller should team up for an album and call it ""Crybabies in Arms"" and donate the money to some stupid cause like PETA. Don't buy this record if you like eating meat. Buy Be Here Now by Oasis instead. Noel Gallagher will punch you in the face if you buy this awful record."
2,no thank you.,"a tad disappointed with this cd. i wasn't expecting ok computer and certainly not the bends, but thought that maybe there would be a few good songs on this album with a lot of emotion that ive come to love in radiohead. no surprises was and still is one of radioheads finest songs largely in part i think because of thoms strong voice in the bridge and that certain level of emotion exerted by the whole band. i dont hear that in any of the songs on amnesiac except perhaps you and whose army? i suppose radiohead is moving in a new direction just as the beatles did with sgt peppers and the beach boys did with pet sounds but these bands were way ahead of their time. people are already doing music like this, ok computer was a new wave of music mixing different electronical elements with rock, that was radiohead amnesiac isnt. id never thought about it before until i read it in a previous review but maybe this is the end of what could have been one of the greatest bands of all time."
2,Same old electronic wanking,"I didn't actually purchase the new RADIOHEAD CD. Nope. Walked around the record store with it in my hand as the always cheerful employees blasted the thing start to finish. When it was all over, I put the CD back in the display case with fingerprints and sweat all over it and left the store without buying anything. RADIOHEAD'S ""Amnesiac"" was to be my last hope in this sad year for music. And now all hope is gone. Goodbye, cruel world.(send all hate mail to my email address--i love it)"
5,An incredible album,"If you liked Kid A, buy this album. I can imagine a lot of people criticizing this album because they didn't shift styles of music, because it shares similarities with Kid A. Don't let that stop you from enjoying this great cd. It is a masterpiece, swooping from sad, inevitable pain to triumphant peaks of glory."
4,good album,"This album is yet another good one from Radiohead. Perhaps ""good"" is a bit of an understatement, but I think amnesiac is a bit of an understatement as well. This band continues to explore different areas of rock themed music, and we are lucky enough to be able to listen in. Thank God a band is out there to deliver something that is truly progressive in this era of poppy-punk and annoying talentless bands. ""Pyramid Song"" and ""Dollars and Cents"" are true gems to be found on this album, and ""I might be Wrong"" and ""Knives Out"" aren't half bad either. Although this album fails in comparison to Kid A, Amnesiac is still heads above any other album that was or will be released this year. I can't wait to see them in Mnt. View Ca, in just a few weeks, it should be truly amazing."
2,"Okay, the lost me here","Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as ""I Might Be Wrong,"" ""Pact,"" and ""Hunting Bears"" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead."
2,sold out,"it's a sad day when a band with as much potential as radiohead subcumbs to the pressure of releasing a glossy pop-ablum. there are still traces of the raw dark kid a but it's all protrayed in a milder light. nonetheless, radiohead still has potential to pull themselves from the corpropate wasteland that they shun and have inadvertently become part of so don't give up on them yet."
3,Fingernails on a chalkboard,"Songs one and two were okay, but the third song ""Pulk/Pull Revolving"" -- what is that supposed to mean, anyway? -- is just weird and irritating. After that I had trouble listening to the rest of this CD and I sold it right away because they grated on my nerves so bad. I don't know, maybe if you like this group, you'll like this CD, but personally, this kind of music is getting tired."
2,Bring back the hooks,Pablo Honey was good. Bends was perfect. OK Computer mixed genius and self-indulgence. Kid A was almost pure self-indulgence--monotonous and pompous. Amnesiac is more of the same. Bring back the hooks!
3,"Odd, different, and unusual describe this album.","Radiohead, what is happening to you? After such incredible masterpieces like Ok Computer and The Bends, why are you changing your style like this? Well this album isn't horrible and maybe people with very different taste would like it, but I just can't put this in the same category as the earlier Radiohead greats. I like my music to be a moving and emotional experience. Not rhythmic, odd noises that put me to sleep. That's being a bit harsh, but I really wish Radiohead would return to their former style."
4,And the verdict is...,"Ok, so I just bought the special edition for this CD at over 20 bucks. Was it worth it? For me; yes. If you are debating on whether or not to buy it, this is the advice I have to offer: if you gave up on Radiohead after ""Ok Computer"", than it's not for you. As expected this album is very much a ""Kid B"" yet I don't think the album is as strong as ""Kid A"". While there are a lot of good mediocre tracks, it is lacking the big staples like ""National Anthem"", ""Optimistic"" and ""Idioteque"" that ""Kid A"" had to offer. The content is definately there...you just need the patience to appreciate it. Newbies to Radiohead following the trends need not apply."
5,They've done it again...,"Wow! Just finishing my initial run-through to ""Amnesiac"", and it is AWESOME!! I had heard the band was going towards a more guitar based approach, but it really only applies to a few more songs than usual, such as ""Knives Out"", and ""Hunting Bears"". The effects and disjointed rhythms that made Kid A so surreal are still there, in spades on virtually every song. This album is wonderful. I never had any doubt though. If you are a fan of good music that doesn't limit itself, and especially of Radiohead, BUY IT. NOW!"
2,I gave it a chance to please me,"I bought this CD and listened to it several times but just couldn't get into it. It's just a bunch of noise! It sounds like Radiohead set out with the express intention of making the worst record they could. I think they just may have succeeded.I guess it does push the boundaries of listenable music, and I give Radiohead credit for that. But this CD is not something I got much pleasure out of listening to. In fact, it gave me a headache.Being experimental is great and all, but I feel like Radiohead is being experiemental just for the sake of being experimental. This was refreshing with their Kid A album, but grows old and dull so very quickly."
3,Kid B-minus,"I'm a big Radiohead fan and I thought last year's ""Kid A"" was an enigmatic knockout, so I've been looking forward to ""Amnesiac"" for months now. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. In short, this sounds like a collection of ""Kid A"" b-sides -- and pretty dull b-sides at that. And what's with the lame alternate take of ""Morning Bell""? That's just shameless filler, which is something I thought Radiohead was above. Grrrr...."
2,Sadness,"This is not a great album. You can tell it comes from the same sessions as 'Kid A' as there is a distinct lack of innovative guitar work ( if isolated, the thing that made radiohead songs vital to the ear?) and no real regard for melody. I understand that the band needed to experiment, needed to move on - but they seem to have lost their way. Like Kid A , a lot of this is meandering around in search of a song foundation. To do it once is an acceptable statement, to do it twice could be taking the [dive]. It reminds me, to an extent, of the way that REM spluttered after going gargantuan and never reached the heights we hoped for. If this were a new band, we would all say ""Hmm, when they grow up they could be quite good"" and they would attain minor indie status. I fear the best of Radiohead is past us."
5,Stunning,"Recorded at the same sessions that produced Kid A, this is essentially more of the same. Not that there's anything wrong with that. If every band made CD's as good as this one I'd bankrupt myself buying new music. This is brilliant stuff: edgy, inventive and addictive music permeated with the band's fetish for moody electronica."
1,About as deep as slippery when wet,"Radiohead really lost the plot with this album. Thier collective ego's must be the size of the grand canyon to think anyone would want to listen to this. All i can say is if you want to be intellectual, read a book. Listening to self important avant-garde drivel like this doesn't mean you're a more complex and evolved being."
1,"Quite bad, and for no good reason","Mostly boring, sometimes painful, with a few hints of remaining quality.I was actually embarrassed when I first played this the other night with my wife in the room. After buying Kid A and now Amnesiac, maybe I shouldn't be allowed to buy CDs anymore. It's because of albums like this that stores need more lenient return policies. If Radiohead continues on, I certainly won't buy the next album until I've heard it."
1,"Congratulations Radiohead, you did it!","Yes, Radiohead, you did it, you actually made a worse album than Kid A! After listening to Kid A for a long time, I was sure it would be years before another well-established group of musicians would be able to put out a bigger piece of ... than Kid A. Ohhhh how wrong I was. Here it is 6 months later and Radiohead themselves are the ones to put out that bomb. Alas Radiohead, you didn't get a penny of my money this time. I DOWNLOADED your entire cd as I do with most cds before I buy them, but I will not be purchasing Amnesiac."
1,I'll take Tomberg hands down,"Not much else to say. Tomberg is an enlightened being. Read his amazing work and it is clearer than a blue sky that this man is here to help us grow and develop. The Anthroposophists who don't want to do that are just stuck in the old and dead. Steiner was about LIFE and MOVEMENT and GROWTH, DEEPENING and if you read Tomberg you will feel it in the deepest part of your heart. You will know it. Too bad there are those on the planet who feel the urge to attack this great initiate. But the work is too powerful. He is giving us something new and deeper and WOW are we ever fortunate and am I ever grateful. Thanks to this courageous soul for his tireless work - what a gift to Anthroposophists who want to grow."
5,Fall of a Peacemaker,"Rest in peace brother, rest in peace. Your unique voice, songs and lyrics will not be forgotten."
4,Danny Joe Brown,This album is a bit bluesy. Musically not as tight as a true Molly Hatchet undertaking. I really like it though. DJB went back to his roots on this. Sounds like an bar room band that kicks A&&. Very good recording quality. This would have been a top seller if it was released with Molly Hatchet. Danny recently passed away and his music and unique vocals will live on. If you are a Molly Hatchet fan this is a must have. I often forget this was a solo undertaking.
5,very hard to find cd,"R.I.P. Danny Joe Brown. this is a must have cd. this was another hard to find cd, but it was worth finding. if you have never heard this one it is worth a listen even to be this old it rocks!!!"
4,its okay,i was disapointed that they were all white instead of different colors but other than that they did what they were supposed to do
2,"Decent service, subpar product.","I saw these and I was happy about the price. It was very reasonable. I ordered them with a bundle and didn't realize until after I had checked out that the shipping for the product was the entirety of my shipping costs and almost doubled the cost of my order. When I got the product it was pretty disappointing. I didn't expect anything amazing since they were so cheap, but what I got for the overall price, I would have been better to go out and buy a box at a sporting goods store. There were about 10 -15 broken balls in each bag of 500, which numerically isn't that bad, but makes for quite a bit of clean up time to get them usable. I would say around 30 - 40% of the usable ones were dimpled and will work only t o shoot around trees. Like I said, the price seemed right, but I got probably less than what I paid for."
2,Cheap but good for indoor id say),"Get what you pay for.. these paintballs were pretty cool/good except the accuracy was garbage. 25 foot shot and you could watch the ball curve.. sometimes they wouldnt break, and also break alot in the barrel. not cool but if your goin cheap then i guess you could go with these."
3,"Ambitious, dense, altogether not motivated","It is a bit ambitious to use deRham cohomology as an introduction to differential forms and analysis on manifolds (compare with the easier and clearer 'Analysis on Manifolds' by Munkres). A bit too much for newcomers, too little for graduate students (compare with Bott and Tu). It is good for advanced undergraduates who are able to handle the pace and abstraction. Few examples and computations."
4,Back of Book Description,"Would their life together be a risk worth taking?Jess Butler. The one with the hair. The famous country-western recording star. Mrs. Bret Cavanaugh. While all these descriptions fit, Jessica didn't really know who she was. She had come a long way from her Southern roots, but happiness was still ever so elusive. Jessica had one more role to try--that of a true wife, away from the glow of a spotlight. She was willing to chance a daytime existence with Bret--she just prayed he was up to the challenge!"
5,Forget Born To Run...,"Men Without Women, along with Southside Johnny's Hearts Of Stone, are the best albums to ever come out of Asbury Park. Just becasue they came after Bruce doesn't mean they couldn't surpass him. As complete albums, MWW and HOS top anything the Boss has done before or since."
3,indian point,It make sense but it should have been much detailed as where are the resources available or may be how to manage for the funds /or if it is in a country specific it would have been excellent though its a very daunting task Otherwise i think the book is a good one
2,"A ""New World"" from Holland","Reading the other reviews listed I seem to find myself in the minority in finding it impossible to seriously recommend this disc.For ""RCO Live""to try and market this disc containing approx.42 mins of music with NO coupling in the face of so many REALLY great recordings(all with couplings I may add)is surely misguided and if for no other reason I find this impossible to recommend.If a recording conducted by Jansons is an absolute must,then his earlier EMI recording with the Oslo Philharmonic(coupled with Smetana's Vltava)is the one I would direct you to"
2,A Disapointment,"This workout might be OK for someone who has been COMPLETELY inactive but I found it offered no challenge whatsoever to the lower body...if you are a beginner,you will outgrow this tape quickly so be prepared to pass it on or pass it up..."
4,Great album!,"While this is certainly a must have for any Pink Floyd fan, I should warn you that it isn't Pink Floyd. Unless you listen to this album with an open mind, you'll be disappointed. I was impressed with Nick's drumwork, particularly on Profiles parts 1 & 2. Rhoda is also a very peaceful and relaxing track with some great soloing. I think this collaboration runs circles around Nick's previous solo album, ""Fictitious Sports"" and it's nice to hear David Gilmour on ""Lie For A Lie"", although the song itself is a bit cheesy. Overall, it's a great buy and I highly recommend it."
4,Very Good and extrange CD,"This is one of the best CD i ever heard, I can't found it in Argentina. I think is a good option to take"
2,Complete the collection,It is ok but it doesn't set the world on fire. A must if you want the complete collection.
1,Look for something else.,"Coleman never cease to amaze me with garbage they make. I not sure how they still in business. Told myself dozen times not to buy it and after every purchase and cooling down period, but did again.Well to make story short this is not pump, it's just a fan with very poor quality of materials. Its will literally break down in your hands. Air pressure is never near to be enough to inflate air bed, not talking about boat or air water slide. My vacuum does better job than this piece of junk. Great thing about amazon that you can always pack it and send it back at no cost.Do you self a favor, exclude word ""Coleman"" from your search for camping/outdoor stuff."
2,Very Scientific - Not for beginners,"This book is not for the beginner or the average runner. It's all science with VoMax, heart rate, running at a certain percentage of your max etc. I was looking for a book about running with tips and advice on getting started, but this is for experts trying to get very good.Maybe it is good if you want to go under 3 hrs in a marathon or break 15 minutes in a 5k.I'm going to sell my book as soon as I can."
5,A journey without the bugbites!,"I have always been curious about the Chesapeake Wetlands. They are so beautiful and mysterious. The Great Marsh took me on a wonderful tour. I have a new appreciation for the ecological importance of the Chesapeake Wetlands, and for the potential danger of attempting to navigate them as a novice. This is a great coffee table book as well. The photos are beautiful."
4,Very well but for the lengthy narration.,"In order not to do injustice to Harnoncout and his cast, I would have given one more star. As it is, I am being forced to copy this opera onto another disc skipping all the spoken stuff by the actor that do not sing any role in the opera itself.Damrau, Schade, Scharinger all gave impeccable performances. You may treat this as a recording of an opera concert, since the opera could in no way be performed with an incomplete libretto.It is indeed regrettable that good old Harnoncourt got into his head the inclusion of such lengthy narratives into the recording. It really hampered the enjoyment of the music and singing."
3,Excellent,This television is great. The picture is brilliant and the color isvibrant. It fits perfectly in the space we have for a television.It is thin and light. Ordering the product through Amazon saved usseveral hundred dollars as compared to the lowest cost retailer on sale.
5,A blast from the past.....,Cleveland Rocks! This is the best CD from the Michael Stanley Band. I own all of their CD's but this is the one I play the most. Listening to this CD makes me home sick for Cleveland!
2,over rated,"Although this album has gotten great reviews from different music critics that think that just because they have that profession they are right about everything they critic, this album has been rated way too high for my personal opinion. I will give Will Smith credit for having a couple of songs that are worth ones time but the rest is music that is very upsetting to my ears. Do not recommend it to pleople that have good taste in music and life."
1,change the song anytime,he should just stick to acting.and to be honest his movies are just like his music one trick pony's.it's got nothing to do with the burbs or whatever it's lame music period.jazzy jeff was more talented of the duo anyway.what's y2k& wild wild west? the same song different singers.where are the original artists at? music is getting worse.
3,Pop fun for the whole family,"""Willennium"" is breezy hip-pop with a touch or rap; people should stop dissin' it for not being something more. Comparing Will Smith to Snoop Dogg or DMX or other serious rappers is silly - even he doesn't take himself that seriously. He's just a boy from the 'burbs putting a decidedly suburban spin on the urban phenomenon of rap - so what's wrong with that? Sit back, relax and have fun - that's what ""Willennium"" is all about!"
5,Willenium is off the hook!,"The tracks on this CD are even more crazy than Big Willy Style. Bring this CD to a party and turn up the volume, you'll be dancin all night! All the tracks are great but the ones that really stand out are: ""Will2K"" ""Pontas"" ""Rain"" and""Fealin' it"". Go out and get this CD!"
1,WILL SHOULD BE ASHAMED,"WILL SMITH HAS BEEN A DISGRACE TO HIP-HOP SINCE DAY ONE:MESSAGE TO WILL ""YOU ARE NOT A RAPPER MOVE BACK TO BELAIR""!"
1,Horrible actor and as a musican... phlease,"Big willie style huh? can he write music, can he read music, does he play any instruments, does he write his own lyrics, does he sing or just talk the lyrics he doesn't even write. Yes BIG willie is a wellspring of talent he sure is...."
4,almost there,"As usual Will Smith produced a CD that contains excellent tracks but as it is the problem of most artist...the CD is not all good. Many songs resemble each other and between you and me...Will can make everybody dance- but his slow songs put me to sleep. Will, please stick to what your good at-because you are good.This CD is still worth purchasing."
3,"His Will2k song is ok, but not as good as his other hits","Wild Wild West is a pretty good song, and Dru Hill makes it better, but his Will2k song can get really annoying and repetitve. I like it, but it's just not up to my will smith standard, kuz all his other stuff was so cool. I don't think that he put a lot of effort into this"
1,Will Smith can't rap,I think that Will Smith needs to stay with acting and stop rapping completely. The only reason that Will Smith should rap is so that Eminem can make fun of him more.
2,Bubble-gum rap at it's worst....,"I mean come on, judge the record for yourself- it's terrible! I appreciate the fact that he doesn't use profanity at all in his songs, unlike other rappers, but hey the song 'Will2K' is downright cheesy and corny, not to mention hideous. As for 'Wild wild west', you don't want me to get started on it-... Clearly, being a rapper wasn't meant for Will Smith- he has no attitude in his songs... Will Smith's a brilliant actor,no doubt, but that's it."
1,I didn't like this cd,Will Smith did a pretty bad job on this cd as he on all his cd's. He doesn't really even sing the songs. Don't buy this cd.
2,He's done better,"I've never been a huge fan of rap. I've always liked Big Willie Style (I still do) Willenium was close to amounting to the success of Big Williwe Style. Will 2k and Wild Wild West and really good songs. The rest of the CD is Will Smith complaining about his lost life with Jada. I know this was in a few songs in Big Willie Style, but not as much as now. ""Freak it"" is a poor imitation of ""Gettin' Jiggy with it."" Songs like Miami are needed to bring Will Smith back. I will forward to any new stuff by Will Smith, but this CD was bad."
5,Willennium,"I remember this album when I was in the 7th grade. I love this album. He ushered in the 21st century with this album. This album promised to echo the success of its predecssor. Several tracks featured production, vocal and/or scratching contribuions from Jeff Townes. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember, this was 1999-2000."
3,Movie was OK,Showed this movie to a senior audience at an Assisted Living community. The reviews were mixed. My Mom said it was not nearly as good as The Glenn Miller Story. I personally have not watched it yet because of the so-so reviews I got from the group...
4,INSPIRATIONAL,LUTHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO ME.HIS VOICE JUST LIGHTS UP A ROOM. LUTHER HAS THE TYPE OF VOICE WHERE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SPIT GAME TO A WOMAN ALL HE HAVE TO DO IS WOOWOOWOOO AND SHE WOULD BE AT HIS FEET BEFORE HE CAN FINISH. IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT VOICE.
5,An Exciting New Adventure with Lewis and Rose Rita!,"For those of us who grew up reading John Bellairs' wonderful gothic mysteries, I think we were all saddened and aprehensive when Mr. Bellairs died and Brad Strickland began the task finishing his stories, and writing new ones based on Bellairs' characters and plot lines. I have to say that Mr. Strickland has done it! I was so impressed with the plot and development of the book that I think it rivals ""The House with a Clock in its Walls"". This is definitely one of the best adventures for Lewis and Rose Rita yet!!! I hope Brad Stickland will continue to develop and explore the wonderfully entertaining characters created by John Bellairs. I also really liked the new illustrator, and look forward to seeing more!"
2,"Great Audio, Not Great Containment","Seriously, these headphones sound fantastic, but they don't hold up because the plastic in the headset is awful, the metal arms connecting the ear phone fits in very poorly, which means over any light use, it will eventually fall out, so keep some strong glue handy, something you should not have to do when spending $150 for a pair of headphones...Really cheap looking and feeling headset, the phones are cheap, the plastic is cheap, the way it's constructed is cheap, but with great audio components...I prefer a headset that lasts longer than a year.I will never buy these again."
5,Grado SR 125 - Jus' Smashing Baby,"After using these cans for 10+ hours, I've found the sound quality to be superb. They will be used for mixing, mastering and production of audio. While the comfort level is just adequate, the foam ear-cups are slowly becoming form-fitting. Highly recommended!"
1,MA 620 Infrared USB Adaptor,"I cannot make this work with my SONY CLIE. I bought this because my PDA quit synching in the cradle. (It synchs fine via IR with the IBM but the Dell Inspiron 700m does not come with IR.) Although it is listed as working with the Clie on the Amazon site, the documentation that comes with it mentions only cell phones, and also refers only to WIN 98, not XP. The IR connection takes forever when I try to synch. in fact, it never finishes. the co. says they will take it back, thankfully. Obviously I don't recommend this. It doesn't deserve the one star you see here but the review could not be posted until a star rating was selected."
5,Five stars is not enough,"I've rated a few books with five stars, and then I read this book and I could not find a six star rating. This book deserves 6 Stars."
3,Night of The Fox by Jack Higgins,This book was a typical Jack Higgins book which keeps the suspense through out the entire story and is always believable.
4,Tense and gripping story line,It kept me on the edge of my seat as the story unfolds during the second World War. Strong character development and a great plot line. I recommend it!
3,Quick Read,Interesting book even though it is quite short. Well written and fast paced. Also interesting from an excellent historical perspective. I did not realize that the German forces has actually occupied English soil during the World War II.
2,Not Higgins' Best,"I have read several books by Jack Higgins, and I consider him to be one of my favorite suspense novelists. Night of the Fox wasn't up to par for him, however. The plot is a good one, but the character development, and the development of the sub-plots in the story were thin. Several things in the story just happened without an appropriate amount of development or preparation. It seems as though Higgins wrote this one in a hurry."
4,Interesting,I didn't know that the Nazi's had occupied a British Island in the Channel during WWII. This was a good book and held my interest. Quick read.
5,A Powerful Exposé,"Christians in the US who do not share the convictions of the Christian Right often feel frustrated that the news media ignore us altogether. At last a bold and powerful voice has arisen to set a lot of records straight. Jan Linn's forceful and carefully reasoned analysis of what's wrong with the Christian Right sets out an agenda for dialogue that needs to be taken very seriously, especially in this pivotal election year. The demonizing of the opposition, the linking of a particular way of reading the Bible with in-your-face patriotism, the baptizing of a single brand of political engagement, all are exposed here with page-turning potency. What Paul Waldman has done on presidential fraud and Al Franken on lying liars, Jan Linn has done on the radically politicized right wing of American Christianity. And not a moment too soon!"
5,Love the Berenstain Bears,I had an old VHS Berenstain Bears from when I was a kid that only had 1 title on it. My kids loved it so I bought this new DVD. The shows are great! They teach good morals and my kids love them. They watch them over and over. I'm so glad to have a show that I can trust!
4,Works Well With MacBooks,"I bought this lock to replace a stolen lock (in a bag, not on a computer!). So far, it works very well.Unlike some others who reviewed this lock, it worked well for me on both a unibody MacBook Pro and a new version white MacBook. I have no idea why these people are having such big problems.As long as you realize that this lock is there to prevent spur-of-the-moment snatches, not determined criminals, you'll be happy. The one I bought here at Amazon was my second so each computer has its own.I should note that the keys don't work as smoothly as my stolen (and very old) lock but that has not been a big deal."
4,Standard computer lock at the office.,"This is the lock that everyone has at the office, and is built well. It's the next generation lock, getting away from the older cylindar style that you see kids popping open on You Tube in 5 seconds. The key itself is somewhat longer than the older units it replaces, but still smaller than a car key.I lock and unlock my lock daily without issue and it feels very secure and is a great visual deterrant for the casual office thief. I have (3).. one for each of my monitors, and one for my docking station/laptop."
4,Notebook Lock performs well,"Product was easy to install on my computer, seated well with little or no wiggle. It was also easy to unlock and remove, something that many of these locks seem to have a problem with. I was well pleased and felt that it offered very good protection and a really reasonable price. Worked well for me on both an iMac and HP laptop."
2,Damaged laptop in 3 seconds,"I just opened my MicroSaver DS minutes ago and tried it out on my MacBook Pro. It put two nicks in the outside of my laptop, and chipped the inner plastic ring in 3 places. Now it works a little more fluidly, but I'm not too pleased about damaging a $2,000 laptop with a device meant to protect it."
3,NOT compatible with Inspiron 1520,"This lock does not fit in an Inspiron 1520. We also have an Inspiron 1505, however, and it works perfectly well with that notebook. Product gets 4 stars for quality (I would like a better-designed key)."
1,"Terrible quality, got jammed in my laptop","The lock got jammed the very first time I tried to use it and it took 10 minutes to pry it off my laptop.The previous Kensington combo lock I bought is also starting to jam.Stay away.------Update: I bought the Belkin cable lock instead, also available on Amazon (Belkin F8E550-CMK Notebook Security Lock, Master-Keyed), and I am happy with it.It's a bit bulkier (it uses a small standard padlock instead of Kensington's custom lock integrated with the cable) but it is much easier to use and it is built better.No more struggling with the jammed Kensington locks..."
