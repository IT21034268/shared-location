4,Great story... OK ending.,"I really enjoyed reading this story. It shows you that people are not what you would expect and to not judge a book by it's cover. Everyone has flaws!What I did not like about this book was the ending. Let me rephrase that - the ending was ok - it just wasn't... GREAT!! The issues that were resolved, I was glad they ended the way they did - and suprised by one or two of them. However, not all of the issues were resolved. Or if they were, I totally didn't catch on.Still a great read though! I read most of it in one day."
3,harumph,"an easy read. a good read. would be nice for the beach or pool this summer. but not the greatest ending. i ended up not really liking the characters as i finished, and throwing the book with an unsatisfied harumph onto my bed before taking off my glasses and turning over to fall asleep."
2,Big Babies,"After reading many reviews touting Perrotta's brilliant writing in this book, I must say I am sorely disappointed with it. The characters, as other readers have pointed out, are hardly likeable (the only one I had any feelings at all for was the child molester, the best developed character in my opinion), but if the book had been better that might not have mattered to me as much. As it was, I found myself skimming through the unbearablly long football scenes and predictable plot line that made up the last third of the book. For my money, a better, certainly more entertaining look at similar (though admittedly not the same) people can be found in ""The Nanny Diaries."""
5,Summer delight,"A copy of this book should be included with every sale of a beach bag or sunscreen! Dive in and be enveloped in its cool depths with regret only that autumn and the end of the story will arrive too soon.This is not to categorize the book as a ""beach book"", shallow and slight. The insights into the inner landscapes of the characters are profound and amusing, poignant and tart.I did not think I could enjoy a Perrotta book more than ""The Wishbones"" but here it is.Yes, Massachusetts has Capes Cod and Ann and the Berkshires, but our finest human resources are Tom Perrotta and Elinor Lipman, masters of modern fiction."
5,excellent treatment of a life history,"Robert Black does something unusual in this book; he edits and annotates the life history of a Hopi/Tewa Indian who was not a traditionalist, nor an especially warm or amusing man. Standing Flower - the traditional name of Irving Pabanale - was a Hopi policeman, judge, and negotiator with the white government early in this century. Black sat with him for many summers, recording his story. In this book, he does an outstanding job of writing comprehensive explanations and history to anchor this man's tale. I've studied many life histories, and always find them to be the best way to learn about other cultures. This book offers both the narrative and a scholarly - but readable - education about the Hopi and Tewa of Arizona. Well done!"
4,although..,although there happened sth wrong but they gave me the efficient way to solve the problem. thanks a lot..
1,Disappointing,"I did not receive the chain that I ordered. The one that was shipped to me was another style entirely. When I sent an email to the company, they replied in an email telling me that I would have to have a specific form to return the chain, but that they were out of the forms and would send one later. Of course, I never heard from them again. I just gave up and used the chain they sent, even though it was not the one I ordered. There is nothing wrong with the chain - quality and design are fine - it just wasn't what I wanted."
4,True to the Title - Basic Guide,I purchased this book to aid in understanding the ailments of the human heart. I found the book to be very helpful as it is written in terms that the average person can understand.
4,For my grand daughter,This will be for my grand daughter for Christmas. I know she will love it too. The price was a little high but when you can't find items local you have no other choice. I would order from this company again. Fast shippment.
1,Nabucco - there has to be better,"The sound on this CD is terrible. It is as if it was recorded from a radio broadcast - very compressed, lacking highs and lows. Callas was not in very good voice, even for her. But her dramatic qualities shine forth even through the bad sound. The San Carlo chorus is as sloppy and ragged as ever - every soprano trying to prove why she should be a soloist. With the Hebrew slaves as undisciplined as they are in this recording, it's a wonder that Nabucco didn't get rid of them earlier! A complete waste of time and money."
4,Netter's Concise Atlas of Orthopaedic Anatomy,Netter's Concise Atlas of Orthopaedic Anatomy (Netter Clinical Science)This is an excellent resource! I use it every day. I am a physician assistant student and purchased this book prior to beginning my orthopaedic rotation. I am so glad that I did! It is a great quick reference for those that are still learning and I am sure that it will continue to be useful when I enter practice.
3,Decent product,"I was looking for a photo-sleeve page that had both vertical and horizontal slots. I also wanted them to fit in a post-bound scrapbook along with my scrapbook layouts. These pages do not have a wide enough area between the photos and the 3-ring holes to allow for the pages to lay flat in a post-bound album. They would, however, work fine if you wanted to use them in a 3-ring album."
5,Health food rocks,A great way to start your day! Nice to have on the Kindle too. The daily faith needs to be released on the Kindle too.
2,switch is defect,"I bought it a year ago, and it worked fine, but now the switch doesn't workany more. After I took apart the switch system, I found out this is a design problem."
4,U5468-900 WINDTUNNEL SUPREME BAGGED REVIEW,"I HAVE BEEN A HOOVER OWNER FOR TWENTY YEARS, (ONE UPRIGHT)! OUR HOUSEHOLD REQUIRED ANOTHER ONE (ONE FOR EACH LEVEL OF OUR HOME!LISTING THE DESIRED FEATURES: PRICE RANGE, WEIGHT, BAGGED, FILTERS, DIRT SENSOR, 30 FT CORD NARROWED THE SEARCH TO JUST THE U5468 WINDTUNNEL SUPREME BAGGED UPRIGHT WITH THE WEIGHT BEING THE DECIDING FACTOR. BECAUSE, IF YOU WANT A SELF PROPELLED WITH SPECIAL FEATURES THE WEIGHT JUMPS FROM 21 LBS (LIKE OUR OLD ONE) TO 27 OR MORE LBS WHICH IS UNWIELDY FOR ME (MALE) LET ALONE THE AVERAGE SIZED WOMAN! WHEN IT CAME I WAS TOTALLY SUPRIZED TO SEE IT WAS (EXACTLY) THE SAME MODEL WE'VE BEEN USING FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. IT'S A WORKHORSE! ONLY HAD TO CHANGE THE MAIN ROTER BRUSH TWICE IN ALL THOSE YEARS IT'S WORST ATTRIBUTE WAS A STIFF CORD LOCATED SUCH THAT IT HAD BEEN NEARLY SEVERED IN A HALF DOZEN PLACES!"
4,good vacuum for the money,"I've bought 3 or 4 vacuums during the last 10 years. They've all worked okay, but there was always something that could be improved upon. This one had features that appealed to my personal needs. Number one was the suction power. I've had vacuums that had more power, but wouldn't pick up a feather if it wasn't stuck just right. This one picks up everything. Number two was I prefer bags rather than emptying a container. No mess. This model had something I'd never had before which I find great, and that is the dirt indicator. I have a motorhome which I thought I thoroughly clean every time. It took me 45 minutes the first time to clean that small area to the point the indicator light stayed green. I'm happy with it now and if it lasts for a few years, I'll have considered it a good deal."
1,Cheap and worthless,"This vacuum doesn't pick up dirt, especially on wood floors; you can roll the vacuum over a piece of paper again and again and it doesn't pick it up. The switch broke after six months, so now you have to unplug it to turn it off. The belt has broken twice, and the upholstery pieces don't stay in place. I'm amazed at the number of positive reviews. Maybe these people have never owned a decent vacuum, but I have, and I'll never buy from Hoover again."
1,The Originals Were Worse Enough,"Ok, ""Cry Me A River"" and ""This I Promise You"" were good. But why make us suffer more? Justin doesn't deserve a tribute."
1,Please help me to stop laughing...,"A tribute to Justin Timberlake!... LMAO... Who's that guy?... Ohh the one who screw all the girls of the jet-set, but he sings? i didn't know that...I think they already have one for 98dregrees, Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore!!! LOL...."
1,Nothing like the original,"Now, I am a HUGHE fan of Justin Timberlake, and these songs and an INSULT to the timberlake fan... with a voice all his own and a style no one can match, these songs are difficult to listen to. The way Justin sings his songs with carisma, charm and a secret that no one else knows but the listener, you feel a connection when you hear JUSTIN sing his songs. These people are far from Justin. (...). It is a slap in the face to anyone who is even remotly a timberlake fan. Stear clear of this rip-off disaster."
1,"I'm sick of these ""Tribute To"" albums.","I hate these ""tribute to"" albums. It's just bunch on Wannabe's trying to someone's music. I'm sick of these American idol rejects doing these ""tribute to"" Albums. The Original Artists are better. I do not like Justin Timberlake as a musicianbecause of his girlie voice but These ""Tribute to"" Albums make it sound a whole lot worse."
1,You get what you pay for,"I respect all music and the fact that someone had the fortitude to release this album. No matter how terrible an album is someone put their creative heart and soul on the line. That being said, someone needs to step away from the karaoke machine. I only listened to the samples and would rather purchase a subliminal message tape on how to succeed in the insurance business. Why anyone would buy this album when Justified & Celebrity are available and ready to purchase right here on Amazon is beyond my comprehension. I do have respect for all music, but I also have an opinion.New album title: `Let's take a few pop songs, karaoke them and make a few dollars'. All of these karaoke albums are like the discount stores of music. The only consolation if you must buy this album is that there are royalties to be paid to the artists who don't just sing.Bottom line, the originals are much better and worth every penny."
5,MAIL YOUR USED COPY TO THE WHITE HOUSE!,"No book is perfect and the use of colloquialisms running through this can get on your nerves. The book's first 50 or so pages put forth a recap of what has happened in the recent past and that portion drags things down a bit. However, once the Colonel takes aim at the mess caused by bureaucrats in every corner of our overstuffed government, he hits bullseye after bullseye. His politics surface from time to time and it's clear he isn't a leftish liberal but his assessments of the pieces of the puzzle that failed us all on 9-11 are honest. His suggestions of how we might improve things rapidly ought to be taken very seriously. My advice to all is: when you finish reading your copy, MAIL IT ON TO THE PRESIDENT. He is the one who should read it and clean house!"
4,Mandatory reading.,This book should be mandatory reading for anyone going into politics or in politics now. This book will open some peoples eyes who have run around with their heads in the sand for a long time.Very easy to read and gets straight to the point. If COL Hunt were running for office I would vote for him because he knows what we need to do to win this war we are waging. It's about time time someone took off the glove and started throwing haymakers at some of the leadership like COL Hunt does.
5,Very helpful resource,"I came across this book five years ago when dealing with a difficult person in my church. It was invaluable then and remains so now.I had about an hour and a half to skim *Antagonists in the Church* and extract very useful information before going into a meeting with this person and another church leader. Though I didn't do the book full justice, I did find that the writing was clear, the information laid out helpfully and accessibly, and the content very germane to the context I was facing. I was able to go into that meeting with much more confidence and a much greater sense of how to conduct my own behavior when confronted with this church member's antagonism.I find the book helpful in helping to define antagonistic behavior and to differentiate it from other kinds of conflict behavior.I recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"I was a member of the Paradise Garage, when it had sawdust on the floor and you needed a ""wrench"" as a membership indicator. I had some of the best (clubbing) times in my life listening and pumping to Larry's destinctive style of jockeying. This CD and the 3 others I purchased by Larry Levan are disappointing. Larry was one the best jockey's of that era and these CD's do not do him justice. I hope you do better in the future, for the days at the Garage are cherished by all us who either were members or attended at least once. May Larry live forever. Timmy Regisford, Frankie Knuckles, James Vincent, and Larry Heard as well as a few others, continue holdin' it down...."
5,Great quality!,"We bought a new desk and coffee table and needed coasters to protect them so i searched and these were the beest value for the $ but i did not know what to exspect for the low price. We are pleased... they absorb well, hae a cork bottom to prevent scratches and they look great!"
4,cute but I easily killed it,"I broke one of the ears off after a week. But it is really cute. I have those silverware drawer compartments, and the rolling around in there must have been too rough. I gave one as a gift, and my friends also said they broke an ear off. If you treat it like something very breakable, it might be fine."
4,Pretty cool,"Very easy to use, very intuitive.First time I was using such a device, I do not use it very often and for what I do (simple photoshop fun), it is perfect, definitely no need to buy something more expensive than that."
4,Good tablet--but beware of built-in drivers,"Good pen tablet--but the drivers that came on the included disk simply don't work with my Windows 7 x64 desktop system.After just a few seconds of using the tablet, my system would crash with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Unfortunately, on the manufacturer's website (UC Logic, the other name for DigiPro), those were the most recent drivers available.I finally uninstalled all those drivers, rebooted, plugged in the pen tablet--and Microsoft found a more recent driver for it somehow and installed that. That did the trick. Now it's working fine with no crashes.Note also that I found the same tablet sold for less on EBay."
2,Faulty Merchandise,"I received the pad in the proper time. The pad works, but the stylus is faulty. The buttons push in too far, and the pad doesn't read it at all. I will be sending the whole thing back, and I hope that I will get a properly fuctioning product this time."
5,Im happy,So far I really like this product. I am new to using Ubuntu and it seems to be working well with both my OS X and Ubuntu systems. I would recommend this product for anyone who would like to know more about using a tablet.
1,"Well, It Worked for All of About Ten Minutes...","My tablet was working for about ten minutes before the pen just stopped working. I tried changing the battery, and then it worked for a bit longer before it stopped working again. So I changed the tip, right? Again, it worked for a short period time, and then stopped, AGAIN. Now it won't work at all. I'm not sure how this product got so many good reviews, you all must have reviewed right after getting it. I now understand why this product is so cheap, it has a pen that never works no matter what you do. The tablet is clearly connected to my laptop, but the pen doesn't do anything! Thanks for ripping me off twenty six dollars of my birthday money."
2,A promising subject that didn't deliver,"While I was hoping for a guide to assist in reducing many expenses the book was a recap of one family's methods of scrimping and saving that were not applicable to me. While I do appreciate the statements such as ""while our kids didn't always have the latest jeans or sneakers like their friends they will always have memories of our many trips to Europe"" I just wasn't motivated to try these tricks. At times I envisioned that the family lived in very close quarters, driving a very old car (Chevette-like), and having mac'n'cheese for dinners. I do have to congratulate the author for making this lifestyle work for him."
5,"Consumers beware, Conserver life style seems healther.","I found this book to be a breath of fresh air from the many books I have read concerning personal finances and money.Charles really is presenting here a paratyme switch, for us many Americans who live to buy things. It showed us some stategies on spending less and living more.This book is a strategy about slowing down the pace of our daily lifes in order to do what we fill is important. It is not a easy strategy and might not fit everyone, but for us it seemed to fit very well what we want to be about. The book contrubuted to us organizing our household so that I could start a small business. It helped alot.It is an easy read with great examples. I highly recommmend this book for anyone to read."
3,Clever book.,"There were many interesting ideas, though some were a bit outdated since the book is not new. I am glad I bought it."
2,very disappointed,I bought into the hype that this was somehow different (or better) than tea tree oil. I've used the product for a week and have experienced none of the miraculous fungus (ringworm) healing that many have claimed. Could have saved money and stuck with tea tree oil since the results in my case were the same
1,What's Happened To This Stuff?,"The manuka oil from this company used to have a powerfulscent, almost overwhelming - which I liked. It came inthe blue-label bottles as pictured at the top of the page.The last two bottles I ordered came in white labelled bottles (same company,same label wording, 100%, etc.) and you can barely smell it. Seemsdenatured somehow."
3,Its okay,I was hoping to find a book to help my almost 4 year old learn math. I was disappointed with this one. The pages are very glossy so coloring the pictures will be difficult. The activities are lacking and some are confusing for kids.I've been wanting handwriting practice for her to learn to write her numbers but every book I find only has one or two numbers to trace and a blank line to practice on. She needs one line to trace and one blank line to practice on. Why include handwriting practice if its not going to be sufficient? Just leave it out.
1,Not a fan of DK workbooks,"Since I love the DK books, I figured the workbooks would be perfect too. Wrong. The stickers do not peel easily or restick to the pages, and the illustrations are boring. The book is out of sequence, and it is not easy to understand. I recommend going with Kumon or Sylvan for the math workbook and SKIP all DK workbooks. I have now tried 3, and they are all disappointing."
4,Nostalgia of DO iT!,"Historically speaking the book has value... for understanding an ideology the book is worthless as there is no ideology, only anarchy. It's fun read and suitable for anyone wanting to learn about the climate back then. A little revolution now and then is healthy."
3,Good vac for the price,"This is a good vacuum for the price. No bells and whistles - for instance, no headlight, no ability to run the vac w/o the beater bar running - but it has great suction and gets the job done. The on-board attachments are a nice feature but if you intend to use them much, do get the accessory hose. The one on the vac is so short as to be almost useless. The accessory hose is described as 20-ft, which may sound like way more than you need or have room for. But it's actually quite compact, with a good amount of stretch. By the way, my hose didn't fit right - too tight, couldn't twist on - but a little filing on the two plastic ears fixed it."
1,How to get an item from you,I did not receive the vacuum. You sent me an e=mail saying it was undeliverable. This was absolutely NOT true. You had my complete address. When I called you I received NO help from your representative -- just re-order If I wanted to.. Very disappointed. Would sure have liked to have the vacuum. But I gave up on Amazon.com. Thanks anyway.
3,Expensive Repairs,"This is a pretty powerful little vacuum; however, the least little thing breaks it down and then I have to pay money for repairs. If something gets caught, it stops working and I have to call the repair man."
4,hoover vacuum,I like the vacuum. It is light enough and yet it is powerful enough. The only problem is the belt broke after just 1 month of use. I hope this doesn't continue.
1,Not good for hard floors,"This product does not perform as advertised. It can not clean hard floors. It disperses the dust through the back. You are better of with a broom and a pail. In addition, I had to replace the belt after only one month of use. It does vacuum carpets OK. So, if you only have carpets in your house and don't mind changing belts often,it may be worthwhile due to the low price. (I guess you get what you pay for...)"
5,Got some dirty carpet?,This vacuum really SUCKS!Nice one Hoover. The brushes spin so hard and fast it feels like it could drive itself.No really. All you have to do is hold on and steer. Barely have to push at all.It is light weight too!
5,"What a ""sucker""!","This product really cleans up. I have used the carpet nozzle on my very good cannister for several years. It did a good job but several things needed to be replaced and that would have been costly. While lying on the carpet, I noticed bits and pieces that shouldn't have been there after vacuuming. I researched vacuums and this Tempo was highly rated by several sources (including Consumer Reports). I was a bit dubious that such an inexpensive machine could be as good as it's PR but thought it was worth a try. The suction is so strong, it actually leaves vacuum marks in my Berber carpet. I use an extraction shampooer regularly. The solution it picks up is less mucky than it was when I used my previous vacuum. The Tempo is pretty noisy but it more than makes up for that with it's cleaning power."
1,avoid this vacuum,"We purchased this in Oct of 2010 based on the Consumer Reports ratings. My wife is begging me to buy a new one now even though this one still runs becuase it has never been able to vacuum the carpets. It sucks, just not the way you want a vacuum to. Someone posted that they have changed since they were initially reviewed. If that is the case Hoover is doing a huge disservice to folks. Don't buy this - sometimes you actually do get what you pay for and having a vacuum that won't do it's job is not much better than nothin' at all."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I should not have expected much at this price point -- but what I got was basically a $75 toy vaccuum cleaner. Wish I had saved my money and put it toward a good one. Very rigid plasticy hose that doesn't bend, and the plastic housing is beyond cheap. The vacuum spits back the dirt while using the cleaning tools. I should know by now that you get what you pay for, and I have learned my lesson not to try and save a couple hundred bucks on a decent vacuum cleaner. Save your money and put it towards a good one."
2,"DIDN,T LAST LONG!!","This vacuum was pretty cheap, and worked pretty well when we first got it, but now, after less than 2 years, it has stopped sucking from the front, only the attachments will suck. We have tried everything to fix it, but we are now having to buy another vacuum. I am bummed because I really like bagged vacuums but they are so hard to find these days in a vacuum that really works well. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,gitter done,"This vacuum realy sucks. And I mean that in a good way. After spending lots of money on other brands only to be disappointed, this vacuum was a nice surprise. It just plain does it's job. If I had to fault it for anything it would be that it is loud and noisy and not ashamed of it. Turn it on and lights will dim, dogs will run, cats will hide and you won't hear the phone. As you go by curtains and bed spreads they will be blown into the air from the exhaust from this machine. It makes alot of noise, moves alot of air is obnoxious and not affraid to work hard. BUT YOU WILL HAVE A CLEAN CARPET.......base boards too. If you are on a budget and just need a good old fasioned vacuum then look no further. If you like to waiste money and have something that falls short of your expectations then buy a Dirt Devil. I would gladley put this monster up against machines costing 3 to 4 times as much."
2,INEFFECTIVE HOOVER VACUUM,THE HOOVER U5140-900 IS THE NOISIEST INEFFECTIVE VACUUM I'VE EVER PURCHASED. IT DOESN'T PICK UP MUCH OF ANYTHING WITH THE WIDE-PATH COVERAGE AND BARELY PICKS UP LINT/DIRT/PET HAIR WITH THE HOSE ATTACHMENTS.
2,Effective but LOUD!,"We were looking for a cheap light powerful vacumn for occasional cleaning of our kitchen floors. The reviews I read led me to believe it was a light quiet and efficient. It is NOT light. It is not quiet- my wife and I have to use ear plugs when using it. It is efficient. For $66 it was a bargain, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Hoover Tempo Widepath,"It is a great vacuum cleaner with a lot of sucktion power. I like most everything about it, light and adjustment height. Not too impress with the side cleaning, but the extra tools can take care of it."
5,"Cheap, simple and powerful","I've had this vacccum cleaner for a little over a year and I have to say it's one of the best investments I've made! I had a more ""modern"" vaccum prior to this but after reading the reviews, I wanted to try this one out. It doesn't have any ""special"" features but it is so powerful and it really sucks everything up on carpet and hard floors. I ended up buying my parents one for Christmas as well, and they're really happy with it too. For being under $100, it is worth every penny!"
3,"some parts good, some parts annoying","For the price of this product I would say it is just, ok. It vacuums just fine on carpet, not so good on floors. Also i would say that the location of where to wrap the cord is a little weird. You have to go over the hoses. and speaking of the hoses. Everytime that I use the hose to vacuum up some corners it hurts to take it off. but overall i would say it is worth the money."
4,Nice!,"I really like this inexpensive cleaner. It is powerful, light, easy to use and also does a good job on cat hair and flat surfaces. I was pleasantly surprised."
2,Hoover Vacuum U5140-900 Review,"It's cheap, yes, so it comes with bad components and assembly.Does not do well on bare floor at all."
4,great vacuum,the vacuum is great for carpets. the hose with the tools work very well on bare floors. good suction power. highly recommended on Consumer Reports.
3,Thought I could live with negative reviews,"Vaccum does a wonderful job of picking up dirt. Suction is so good that one might think it is self-propelled. For sweeping this is a great buy. If you want to use the hose and attachments you won't get far. The hose is short and has a tendancy to come off while vacuumming if you tug too hard. As one reader wrote, you must keep the vaccum upright or dust/dirt comes out the while using the hose, defeating all cleaning. I thought I could manage cleaning with the hose and attachments but, should have relied on the reviews. This vacuum will go to my office for general vacuuming after I find a replacement. Hopefully, Hoover has a vacuum that offers a longer, more flexible hose that stays in place and dirt stays in the bag. I love the suction of the vacuum."
2,Not worth it,"I really wanted to have a powerful vaccuum that would suit my needs with toddlers in the house, and after lots of research & a consumer guide glowing review I thought this would be it. However, the hose collapses in (narrowing to basically having a blocked off tube) to the point of not being able to suction anything up. I called the Hoover company & they told me (although not printed in the instructions that I could find) that you need to ""extend"" the hose prior to each use. I have had many other vaccuums in the past that I never had to do this with & they NEVER collapsed. I was told I could take it to the nearest Hoover authorized repair shop (waste of hours of my time) so I just ordered a replacement hose, making sure to ""extend"" it prior to each use, but it did the very same thing. Not good for my house where I only use the regular part for the area rugs and mainly use the hose attachments for corners of hardwood floor/stairs/fridge coils/vents, etc."
2,not good for hard surfaces,"First, let us consider the positive. This vacuum is decent for carpets, and the cord is long enough for two moderate sized rooms. But the negatives outweigh the advantages. The bags do not secure very well, and dust builds in the container that should stay in the bags. On hard floors, this vacuum is a disaster. It just flicks dirt around instead of picking it up, even on the bare floor setting. I would not purchase this vacuum if you plan on using it on hard surfaces."
5,Hoover Tempo,[[ Very satisfied...reasonable price..good vacuum cleaner.SIN:B0009ONZ8G Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum]]
2,vw,Lousy on bare floors.....roller brush kicks back dirt before it can be sucked up. Adjusting the height does not help. Has strong suction for carpets though and is easy to propel forward but hard to pull back.I had high hopes for this machine based on the reviews but was dissapointed.
5,Great Vac W/ Great Suction,The suction in this vacuum is outstanding. It sucks up dirt on thick carpets to hardwood floors with ease. This was definitely a great purchase. Worth every penny!
4,Good vacuum for the price,"We have all kinds of Oreck products. We moved into a new house and has Frieze carpet. The Oreck XL would not work on this type of carpet. I searched Consumer Reports and found this Hoover on Amazon for only $69! Received in only a few days in excellent condition. It was easy to put together. I think the attachments are a little awkward and have read that they fall off easily, but it seems to be a good upright vacuum cleaner. Bags and belts easy to find, won't have to go to special store to find them. I am so disappointed that I can't use my Oreck XL upright anymore, but happy I found such a cheap replacement for it!"
4,Hoover Tempo widepath Upright Vacuum U5140-900,"Researched Consumer Reports and decided to take a chance with this low price but highly rated vacuum. Have used it about five times so far and like it very much. With the discounts, this purchase was well under $100, so value is off the charts. I'm hoping durability is at least above average."
4,Good vacuum,"I am happy with the vacuum. We've had it in our apartment for about a year now, I think, and it works well. It is light enough to carry around and does a good job cleaning/picking up ""stuff"".What I did notice is that the kitty litter in the kitchen, even when the setting is set to low/no carpet, that the vacuum catapults the scattered kitty litter backwards. Now, I sweep it up and then use the hose to suck up the little pile of kitty litter. But the shooting out the back was a first. Not a big problem once you know how you want to solve that solution.The other issue is that it seems a little tricky to insert the new vacuum bag into the machine. The last one I installed felt like it was on the verge of tearing. But this also is an issue I am willingly coping with.I can really recommend this item Hoover based on its flexibility and performance.Four stars simply because I've had better, but for this price, in my opinion, it's almost a must-buy."
4,Hoover Vacuum Review,"After trying so many times of vacuums, I like this one the best. I has all the features I need and favor. For example, it is lightweight so it is easy to move around. Even though it is light, the power is still strong and it picks up the smallest of the small. I crushed some cereal into the smallest pieces and it picked it up instantly. The downside and the reason I gave a four star is because it can not fit into my sedan car. Overall, this product is great and I use it very often and would recommend it to anyone for home and office usage."
3,So far so good,"I've only used this twice so far (I guess that means it's been doing its job). I do agree w/ some of the comments about the cord being short, wished it were longer. I haven't tried it on bare floors, but I use a smaller vacuum for that usually anyway.I'm a satisfied customer."
3,"Powerful on carpets, but hose for tools not long enough.","The Bad News: It was easy to push forward but it took a lot of effort to pull back. Too, when I tried to use the dusting brush for vacuuming windowsills, the hose was not flexible and was way too short. Stretching the hose caused the upright cleaner to tip forward, which is a major flaw in my opinion. The only way it is an improvement over our old vacuum cleaner is that it is lighter-weight.The Good New: This is a highly rated vacuum cleaner and my husband thought I would love it since it is light-weight. I do appreciate that aspect and found that it has cleans carpeting very well. Also, it does not ""whine"" as some uprights do."
3,"Bad Belt, just like others","Great price at $70 and free shipping, great cleaning power especially with 2 rabbits running around the place. All the accessories that was included was also good in getting to the hard to reach areas. But one sticking point that seems the same throughout some other reviews is the drive belt, the belt snapped under 2 months of ownership, probably 6-9 times of light usage (two medium area rugs)."
2,Failed after a year,"Buyer beware. I purchased this vacuum a year ago, and even though it worked well at first, a year later it is dead - no more suction. In addition, the machine became very loud after the first month. Next time I'm going with a Dyson."
4,Cost-Benefit Ratio is excellent,"Amazon did not have the Panasonic canister vacuum I wanted and ordered, so I ordered this vacuum (with skepticism). It is excellent at cleaning my bare wood and tile floors and also the small amounts of carpet in this house. There is always dust coming into this (not very well built) house. This vacuum gets everything up and is very powerful for its size and price.The only negatives so far are that the hose could be longer for using the cleaning tool attachments under low furniture, and, I have problems keeping the cord out of the way when I am vacuuming (this may be because I am left-handed).I am pleased with this purchase and think the vacuum does an excellent job, far better than I could expect given its price."
4,An excellent value .,"This vacuum does just what it is supposed to do. It vacuums the carpet, it's easy to use, and it does a great job for us. It replaced a ten year old Kirby vacuum and I think the Hoover has more suction than the Kirby did. Overall, the Hoover is an excellent value."
1,Good but short lived,"Bought this vacuum because it was rated a best buy by Consumer Reports and the price. It arrived at my house in July and it was ""buried"" in December. The suction was great, but obviously the durability was lacking. In addition the hose is too short."
1,"Save your money, buy another vacuum!","For the price of this vacuum, I wasn't expecting much, despite the good reviews and consumer report's recommendation. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This vacuum had great suction, is easy to maneuver, does not weigh too much, and is very affordable. However, it works MUCH better on carpet than bare floors. It does pick up small particles and leaves on our linoleum kitchen floor, but does not pick up cat litter-it spits it backwards at you. I have to sweep the kitchen/utility room before I vacuum it. Besides this inconvenience, I would highly recommend this vacuum.UPDATE 1/2011: One month after writing this review, we took this vacuum to the dump one month after this review. The cord split in half lengthwise, and the suction stopped completely. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!!"
4,good vacuum good price,Bought this to be the upstairs vacuum but decided to keep in downstairs for myself instead. Nice pickup
5,Great Vacuum at a Great Price,"Pros: Price, Suction Power, WeightCons: Ugly, Cord Wrapping AreaBought this about a month ago to replace an Eureka brand vacuum. I have been very please with it. My house has mostly hardwood floors, but we have rugs in almost every room. I have carpet in my office and another room. This vacuum has been perfect for those rooms and rugs. There is almost nothing this vacuum can't pick up. I have even used the ""Bare Floors"" setting with good results. It's lightweight enough to move around easily, yet has the power I need to get my floors clean.My only complaints is the blue color I feel is ugly, and the way the cord is wrapped on the back is a little annoying... I know these are stupid complaints, but they are complaints none-the-less.Overall for the price, this is a great vacuum. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality product with a very good price."
1,"Horrible, was happy at first","When I first bought this vaccum, I was very impressed with how well the suction was and how easy it was to manuever. But now that I have had it for a year I absolutely hate it. There are 2 screws at the base of the handle that hold the handle to the rest of the machine and those screws dont screw into anything, they fall out all the time and when they do its impossible to vacumm, you have to stop, push the screws back in and then continue till they fall out again. I do not reccomend at all. I have had multiple people look at the screws and try and secure them in without sucess. The suction of the vaccum has also decrease dramatically since I first bought it. And the tools dont stay in their storage areas well either, they fall out frequently."
2,Not Good for Pet Hair & Bag a Pain to Change/Check,"I purchased this vac after reading many consumer reports like websites mentioning this was the best ""value"" priced vac. However, as the owner of 3 cats (2 long hair) this vacuum does a terrible job handling the pet fur. The fur fills up the bag after 2 once a week vacuums. The fur sometimes clogs the tubing leading to the bag and clogs the hose easily.Changing the bag this frequently is awful. The bag always poofs large amounts of fur & dust out into the air removing it. The bag is a pain to reinsert and the cheap plastic cover is difficult to maneuver back onto the little pegged slots."
4,Hoover Tempo vacuum,We receive our vacuum and it came really fast. It is great! It picks up dog hair and all the crumbs from the floor. Linda Starr
2,Hoover Review,Bought this vac on the recommendations of Consumer Reports and the many favorable reviews on Amazon. This unit is so loud to operate that you need hearing protection to use it. It is louder than my shop vac. I have initiated an return/exchange for this product. I hope mine is just a fluke. Does anyone else have this problem.
5,Great Little Vacuum,"This is one amazing vacuum cleaner for the money. We were very surprised that there was a vaccum out there that performed as well or better than most at a fraction of the cost. Easy on the pocketbook. Does a super job of picking up dirt, especially on a well-worn carpet."
2,I have seen better,"After reading the many great reviews on Amazon and Consumer Reports I was thrilled to get a great vacuum for a great price. What I found, however, is that the vacuum is extremely loud with a shrill, high pitched sound. The upholstery tool is attached behind the handle and hose continually gets knocked off. When you use the tool it falls off of the hose easily as well. The cord must be wound over the hose which is very awkward. The vacuum blows dirt around on the hard floor, and when you detach the hose to vacuum upholstery or a corner, debris blows all over the back of the vacuum and floor/carpet. The hose is very short and makes it difficult to reach very far without repositioning the vacuum, even from the front to the back of the couch. If you do not reposition, the vacuum falls over.If its use is only to vacuum carpet and you can stand the loud noise, due to its decent suction, it is a good vacuum for the money which is why I gave it two stars."
3,Good for the price,"After reading reviews, I was mainly concerned about two issues: cleaning floor and noise. I had a Panasonic upright vacuum before this Hoover. Compared to Panasonic, Hoover needs much more work to clean floor. I need to go over several times and still there are some things left. At floor position Panasonic sucked very well. If you mainly have floor in your house, I do not recommend this vacuum. Noise is not bad. It is not quiet, but not that loud either. Accessories (brush, nozzle etc.) are cheap quality. One of brushes does not stay at the storage place and keeps falling. And a big minus was it does not have an automatic cord reel, which Panasonic had. Especially the cord and the hose are top on each other. It is inconvenient to use the hose when the cord are partially winded or vice versa. Overall it does its job for what I have paid."
4,WORTH THE PRICE,I have a Hoover EmPower Widepath bagless that I purchased 18 months ago.It cost 3 times as much as the Tempo and is not half as good. The Tempo outclasses the more expensive vac all the way.
5,Inexpensive Hoover vacuum,I bought this upright vacuum for my son to use in his apartment. It was rated highlyin Consumer Reports and seems to be working fine. Set up was easy--only a few parts toput together. Quick delivery from Amazon.
5,Best vacuum I've ever used,"I bought this a few years ago when Consumer Reports listed this as a Best Buy. For under $100, this Hoover Tempo Widepath truly outperforms vacuums in the $300-500 range!PROS- This works well on thick carpet, berber carpet, tile, and hardwood- After about a hundred uses, this still sucks strongly (literally)- Compared with other uprights, this is relatively lighter; works great on stepsCONS- Not a huge fan of bag vacuums but this works fineOVERALLAt this price, I'm tempted to buy another one!"
4,great vacuum,"skeptical because it was such a good price, but very pleased. Two things, a little loud, and blows out hot air on left from motor I guess - BUT suction power makes up for it and lightweight, self propelling is great. wish I had bought two."
4,Sweeper review,Had a little difficulty putting it together but that was probably because I didn't read the directions correctly. Works fine--picks up well. Light enough to carry around.
4,works great for the price,I looked for this particular vacuum after viewing Consumer Reports ratings and found it on Amazon. I was trying to find a good product for a good price. It works great and I would give it a five star rating for the price but the only negative things that can be said about it is: it's kind of loud and the attachments are not the best of quality (which is the same as other reviews I've read about it).
4,Good vacuum for the price,"I haven't yet tried the tools, but the vacuum works well. It has good suction and a wide path. The only thing is that it was a bit difficult to get the front panel covering the bag to stay on, and the power button is a little awkward to reach. I would recommend it."
4,Great 2nd vacuum,Bought this as a second vacuum to use in basement and garage and love it. Has great suction. Will buy another one for daughter's apartment.
4,Hoover Tempo - a Great Vacuum!,"The Hoover U5140-900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum is a powerful, and a somewhat light weight vacuum! The mounted tools, length of cord, power and ease of use are great. The only negative thing is the edge cleaning is a bit weak. This vacuum almost pulls itself and has an extra click to drop lower to clean under furniture.You get a lot for the price and I would highly recommend it."
5,"Great Vacuum, even better price!","I am now on my second Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum. I bought my first one 2 years ago, and for some reason it stopped working. Although I didn't like that I needed to buy a new one so soon, the price makes it painless! I thought about trying to get it fixed, but it would be cheaper to buy a new one. The vacuum has great suction, and works better than more expensive vacuums that I have purchased. I would agree though that the cord could be longer. If you are looking for a GREAT inexpensive vacuum, you have found it."
4,Great vacuum for the price,"I had read reviews before I purchased the Hoover Tempo Widepath, so there were no real surprises. The suction is excellent. The hose could be longer, it would make it easier to vacuum furniture, when you are not on ground level. The somewhat high noise level does not bother me. My two cats would disagree, of course. The weight is good, not too heavy to easily lug around. I personally like a vacuum with a bag, so this one is good for me. The price is another plus."
2,Not for Bare Floors,"I have two rugs that are basic jute, and bare floors. This vacuum cleaner just blows the sand and dust right back out all over my feet. I have to dust more often and make sure I wear shoes & socks when I vacuum!"
5,Gma stole it!,"I bought this vacuum for myself, but when my Gma's vacuum died I took it over to her to ""borrow"". I never got it back. She loves it! It's lightweight, powerful and handy with all the tools. I am buying myself another one."
1,Hated it,"I bought this because of the many reviews that all seemed positive. What a mistake! First, its so loud you need earplugs. Its also very heavy. The vibrations are probably enough to give you carpal tunnel. The hose, when it comes to using attachments, is so short it is constantly popping out. The heaviness makes it obsolete, IMO, even if everything was great. This is the only time I ever regretted availing myself of the Amazon reviews, which is usually a big draw for me. Nope, I will buy my next vac in the store."
3,Older model was good while it lasted.,"We bought the older version in 2009 and it was great for a few years until things started breaking on it (hose where attachments go, place where hose connects to the vaccum, on/off switch). Now so many parts are duct taped together that I want to replace it. Still does a great job of vacuuming but the hose comes off all the time and because the belt still moves when you use the hose, the friction has melted our berber carpet in a few places. Can't complain too much for the price though. Based on the most recent reviews this newer model is worse than the one we currently need to replace so I guess I'll keep looking. There just isn't much out there in the way of bagged vacuum cleaners anymore. Too bad!"
1,Do not buy if you have hard floors with rugs!!!!!,"I really don't know how this vacuum got so many good reviews. I have laminate floors with area rugs and all this vacuum does is take the crumbs and dirt and fling them back on to my feet. Even on the bare floor setting this vacuum cannot and will not suck all the debris up. And, if you have a dog that sheds, like I do, forget about it. You'll be swimming in dog hair up to your elbows!!!! Do not, I repeat, do not buy this vacuum...especially if you have hard floors like I do!!"
3,Another Hoover bites the dust,"After having multiple $400 Hoovers break, (their switchgear is the worst), I tried one more time with their inexpensive, slightly smaller unit.Powerful suction, quite noisy, excellent on carpet, ok on hard floor, light enough to use on stairs, skimpy short cord, cheesy air hose that is already starting to collapse. For the price, however, this is a lot of vacuum for the money. If you like the feel of fine machinery, look elsewhere.Update Aug2011 noisy noisy replaced with much quieter Miele"
5,"Simple, yet great!","I just love my Tempo vaccum. It's a simple machine inexpensive machine that gets the job done. I've only recently purchased the machine, but have been very impressed with how good it picks up the dirt, hair and paper. It cleans my rugs and carpet beautifully!!!"
4,"Good pickup, average maneuverability","This is my first upright vacuum after using several canisters. Even though you have to buy bags for it, I'm loving the pickup power on my carpet - much better than a canister vacuum of the same price. It's also really nice not to have any filters to clean out. Bags are pretty easy to replace, and it even has an indicator to tell you when to change it. I love the headlight which allows you to see what you're vacuuming in poorly lit regions.Negatives: Maneuverability, as with most uprights I believe, is somewhat lacking, but doable. This vacuum is a bit loud and high pitched. The removable hose for using with attachments on corners and upholstery is short, but extension hoses are available.Overall, I'm very happy with this, and for what I paid I consider it a good buy. Its cleaning power beats the Euro Pro Shark Bagless Canister vac any day."
3,My wife has difficulty using it.,We were looking for a powerful and light upright vacuum. This vacuum does not meet our needs.
3,Great suction but not as good in other areas,This vacuum has really great suction! I was not happy with the hose though. It is extremely short. You can't reach ceilings with it. It is also made of very flimsy plastic and the first time it was used 3 of the rings of the hose dented inwards. They could have improved the bristles on the brush attachment too. They're flimsy as well. I sent an email to the company who I ordered it from telling them to replace the hose but they completely ignored my email. I was in the process of moving house so didn't have time to pursue this further.
1,big belt problems!!!,"We bought this because everyone raved about the suction power of the vacuum. Sure, it does the job but in the meantime, it goes through belts like crazy!!! After running the vacuum less than a month, we needed our first belt which we ordered online. It arrived a couple of days later with 7 more belts in the package. My wife and I laughed, and tossed around the idea of sending the extra belts back but in the end, decided to keep them. We're glad we did!!! Within a year the vacuum burned them all up... Lesson learned, you get what you pay for."
4,Great so far,"only have few weeks, great on carpet, can tell it has very good power.and much lighter than the others we have, thank goodness."
4,good for small places,This is a perfect vacuum cleaner for a small area. It is very powerful and has a light on the front so you can get right into the corners.
4,Yup- It's a good vaccum for the money,Suction yes. A little bulky yes. Short hose- yes. But those are all the negatives. It's a great deal for the price and it works like charm. I'm happy with it.
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!,"THIS VACUUM CLEANER IS TERRIBLE, TRIED IT TODAY AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE PURCHASED IT"
1,HORRIBLE!,Save your money. Not the same vacuum as in 2010. CHEAP imitation. Brush is horrible for low carpets. No bag full indicator. Only good thing is suction. Consumer reports rated this as a good buy. I call it a good bye... Mine is sitting in the trash as I type this. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS VACUUM TO ANYONE.
3,Cheaply made,"I have to agree with some other reviewers who noted the flaws in this vacuum. The plastic parts are not well designed and fall off so often that I'm thinking of gluing them on. The hose is stiff and trying to use the handheld tools inevitably ends up with the hose becoming disconnected from the intake port. Relatively minor issues I suppose, but annoying none the less. Ultimately I think I would spend a little more and get something different if I could do it over."
3,good vacuum & price - belt broke on 2nd use,"On the 2nd time we used this vacuum, the belt broke and the brush, of course, wouldn't turn. Had to run out and buy a few new belts to keep in stock. but the pickup of the vacuum is great."
5,Best buy!,"This lightweight vacuum does a great job! We looked at machines twice the price, but couldn't ask for anything better than this. This truly is a good vacuum at a reasonable cost."
2,"Twice the cost, not better than a Bissell","I bought this based on the good reviews and thought it would be better than my bissell which was no longer picking up on floor level. I am SO disappointed in the performance. It is about equal tothe bissell which I only paid $40 for and yet this was twice as much! It sucks up well with the hose separately but the floor vac part doesn't seem to do very well at all. Such a pain to return big things so I just emailed amazon to tell them how disappointed I was. Next time, I won't buy big items online. Better to buy local so I can return them easily."
2,Waste of money,"Please do not purchase this machine.I read the reviews and got one.I used it 5 times now.IT DOES NOT CLEAN ANYTHING.I got a new one and now, I have to sell it.Its not more than 1 month old"
2,very dissapointed,"I ordered this vacuum after reading the reviews and also because I always thought Hoover was a good name product. The first time I received it , the product was broken already in the box and I had to send it back. When I saw how cheap the plastic casing of the vacuum was made and how the little blue clips were all that kept the cover on I was both angry and dissapointed. I had to have someone drive me to the ups store to return it. In the meantime, my daughter who was trying to help me got on the computer to print the return adress for me and not knowing what a piece of junk it was ordered me another......... I'm not going to return it again. I'm done. I will use it until it breaks and I'm sure that won't take long. Great Expectations from a product that used to be wonderful. I'm a child of the fifties and my mom and myself always swore by American made (NOT) well built appliances such as Hoover. IT's been a long time since anyone has gotton their money's worth."
3,Loud Hoover Tempo,"Haven't used this machine a lot but it seem to be worth the $70. It is quite loud so my wife said to use it out in the garage and front porch carpet. This is actually what I purchased it for anyway, but I thought I would let her use it in the house to see how she would like it.I like the wide path pickerupper and adjustable height features, looks like a keeper."
4,Hoover Tempo,"Very powerful vaccuum that sucks up everything, including the rug if you do not have the vaccuum adjusted high enough from the surface. After adjustments were made, the vaccuum was wonderful."
3,vacuum,great price and quick shipping. Only problem is the on/off switch doesn't work on the vacuum so I am stuck with a vacuum that is always on when plugged in and to turn it off you have to unplug it. It's a PITA but for the price I am not going to pay for return shipping to get it corrected and or wait 3 hours on hold to speak to someone at hoover to help correct the problem. Other than the on/off switch the vacuum has amazing suction power and is real easy to push/pull over any surface and the wand attachments work great.
2,Forget it!!,Broke in 6 months.Had to constantly clean the brushes when in use.My search for a decent vaccum goes on.........
4,Exceptional vacuum,"This is an excellent vacuum, especially considering the price. Picks everything up that is in its path. I only gave it four stars because it is a little noisy. It is a great value and should be considered by anyone looking for house vacuum."
3,Hoover Tempo not good for pet hair,"This is a good little vacuum cleaner for the money and has lasted three years with no repairs. It's great for small jobs, but don't expect a lot of suction. I gave one to my daughter who used it for about six months and then bought a Kirby because this one wasn't doing the job. She has two kids, a dog and a cat. But it's still working. As I said, it's great for small jobs. I have had two dogs and now one, a lab, and it simply does not pick up the hair off carpets."
4,"inexpensive, gets the job done, but clunky","i've uesd it about a dozen times now. happy so far. has great suction. can't complain for the price that it is. takes a little muscle strength to push around. bag is a bit small, but if you don't have pets, shouldn't be an issue. with my old hoover (which i had for 10 years before it died), i could smell the dust every time i turned it on, but with this one, there's no smell of dust. plastic looks cheap and design is aesthetically not pleasing (actually, kind of ugly) but for the price, who cares."
4,Better than expected,"Lots of value here for the price. The front fits underneath kitchen counters nicely. Tools are on board and easy to use. You won't find this vacuum for this price anywhere else. It is loud, but I really can't find anything else to complain about."
3,great vacuum but hard on belts,Ilike this vacuum but has broken 2 belt in 2 vacuum sessions.The first time out the belt broke and then once again after 2nd use also.does a great job aside from that.
4,Best buy for the price!,Vacuum was delivered in just a few days.The Hoover beats my old Oreck hands down. We love it!
5,New to vacuums,"Having just adopted a new dog, I was in the market for a powerful vacuum to take the new stress of dog hair out of my life. I was just about to lay down the $400+ for a Dyson when I came across all of these reviews. Considering the price, I decided the Hoover was worth a try -- best decision EVER! It is SO powerful, gets all of the hair off the carpet and wood floors in one pass. And, considering the fleas that came along with my lovely dog, it has been a HUGE lifesaver to have an actual bag in there catching all the bugs. I highly recommend this vacuum!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This machine came with sharp edges around the extension tube holders that lacerated my hand when I tried to pull out one of the extension rods in the normal fashion.When I contacted the company, they didn't want to know and wouldn't come to inspect. They wanted me to send the machine to them.Their customer service is also abysmal.The machine also began sparking around the on/off switch after about 6 months.The last time I used it, it ended up emitting smoke.Hoover used to be a good company but after this experience, I would not buy their brand again and suggest you don't either."
4,Lots of power,"This vacume is very nice for the money. My carpet is over 15 years old, and it lifted it up nicely. The only thing I didn't like is the cord is a little short. I would definately buy this again, it has lots of power and is light. Very easy to push and has the onboard tools."
4,Tempo vacuum,"An overall really good item for the price. It doesn't do very well (for me) on hard floors, the only reason not 5 stars."
5,Great deal for a 12 amp vacuum,"For the price, this is great. After looking at the fancy space-age looking vacuums at my store, I was wondering if I could find a vacuum that just does it's job without all the frills. Luckily I stumbled across this on Amazon. I liked that it's a 12 amp motor and bagged. My last bagless vacuum just seemed messy. This vacuum does a great job with my pet's hair. Great value."
5,Simple Value,"If you are looking for a great vacuum without the bells and whistles, this is what you want! Great suction. Great performance. All of the basic upholstery/crevice attachments. This vacuum does the job and does it well!"
5,unbelievable price for value,"I have used a Kirby vacuum all my married life--38 years, and it was just getting too heavy to push around--older model. I looked in Consumer Reports for their vaccum tests--this is not the top-rated model but listed as a best buy. It was $240. less expensive than the top-rated model. It picks up unbelievably well, it is self-propelled, fairly lightweight, and carries all attachments with it. I love it. Some parts are plastic so will not last a lifetime--but will be OK for next 10 years--until they invent something better that I don't have to push at all. I know they have the robots now, but they aren't worth the money. I'm very satisfied."
1,Missing parts,"I am unable to rate the performance of my new Hoover Widepath vacuum due to the fact that there was a MAIN part missing. The main hose, which goes on the back of the vacuum, was NOT in the box when I received it. I have had this vacuum for OVER a month now, & STILL have not received the hose. When I called Hoover, they told me the part was backordered from the manufacturer & I should receive it in 2-3 wks. I called them 10 days ago & they informed me that the part was due in on Nov. 19th. I have not received it. I became suspicious when I tried to order it from their website & one of the options was ""missing parts"". Does this mean that this happens frequently??? They could at least send me some free bags for the inconvenience!! I hope to receive the hose this week......if I do, I will let you know if it was worth the wait & how it cleaned my filthy carpets!"
4,Best Value for the dollar,"Most of our vaccum purchases have been for ones costing about $300. While this is not a $300 vaccum, it comes close: very easy to push/pull, wide path, and most of all does a great job.The Best Price for the dollar"
3,A good book but needs updating,"This book has some great concepts but I think it's somewhat outdated. The examples are often based on the mom at home/dad at work scene that doesn't fit my family. I like the general tone and the idea that respectful discipline is the right answer. I found a few other books that follow this way of thinking but that are more contemporary and fit many different kinds of families, Kid Cooperation and The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children are two worth looking at."
5,#1,"This books is fantastic. It's highly readable and has great real-life examples. I'm reading for a second time, and my baby isn't even talking yet. However, I think the principles are so wonderful, and it's never too soon to practice speaking and listening in a way that nurtures both your children and the rest of your adult family."
4,"Great for parents, pretty useful for educators","It's a good manual for parents. I wanted something that would be more useful as an educator, and find that this isn't exactly what I'm looking for... my need is more counselling-related and less about how to deal with the constant nagging and issues that parents face full-time. Still, it has some really good points about how to communicate with kids."
5,We raised two kids with this book,"We read the book and went to her seminar.The kids are now 19 and 22.The book changed me.When a neighbor screams at me, I respond calmly, ""You sound angry."""
1,Waste of money,"I purchased the book on CD and the re-enactments were cheesy and the whole thing was unrealistic. The problem with people who write these kinds of books, just reinforce the epidemic that children run the household and the parents don't. The examples were full of children talking back to their parents, rolling their eyes and saying and doing things that I would NEVER even think of doing when I was that age. If your children are already talking back to you and direspecting you, then you have already set the precedent of letting them get away with it, but now you want to undo the damage? It's too late because the child already has you trained."
1,no way!,I think this kind of book should be written by kids! I mean who knows about the subject of the book more than those people themselves?I hated this book and I don't reccomend it!
5,"If you are reading these reviews, you need this book...","This is one of those books I really wish I could read to the end, but I never need to. Every time I'm in need of some child rearing solutions, this is the one book I reach for. I flip through the first few chapters reading the areas I've already highlighted and I am right back on track. After the refresher, the arguing (for the most part) stops immediately and everyone is much calmer, happier and we can go back to being that well oiled family unit that we all crave. I also have the audio version on my iPod to give a quick listen when grocery shopping, hiking, or cleaning. This book is such a helpful ""guide"" that can be used with not only talking to your children, but everyone you come in contact with. Now if only I could get my daughter's first grade teacher to read this...GrRrr"
3,Meh,"I have a 9 year old and an 11 year old, this book seemed to be geared more towards a younger children set."
4,A child knows when you are really listening,This is a wonderful book and useful tool for those who really want to reach your child with sensitivity and empathy to what they are feeling and going through. Children really know when you have laid everything aside and are truly listening to their cares and concerns.The most amazing connections occur when you take time to reach out to a child in need!Patti B. OgdenauthorKeoni's Big QuestionKeoni's Big Question
2,Very superficial; does not go into details.,"The audio tape mentions the authors names more than anything else. It does give examples, but doesnt go deep. On a particular subject it will tell you what you should do and give one example and move on to the next thing. It should really go into more detail on each issue it seeks to address/correct.Just when I was getting into it, it was over. It wasn't even an hour long. Definitely buy it used and as a supplement to another book on parenting. I don't feel like I know more on parenting because of it."
5,ORDER THIS BOOK NOW!!! It will change your life and your kids!,"This book is a ""must have"" for everyone. It teaches you (quickly & easily) how to incorporate new ways of speaking to not only children, but anyone with grace, courtesy and respect AND have them respond in a positive way with almost immediate changes in their behavior. This book has improved my relationship with my children and husband better than classes, therapy or anything else I've read or tried."
5,Best book on kids I have read,I have gone and bought about 6 different books in the last 6 months or so. This book is one of the smallest and yet the best one I have read - I like the great example situations and how those are meant to be handled.I plan to buy one for each of my brothers.
5,great book,this is an amazing book for anyone with kids! i can't emphasize how well this book is written and how practical it is. Really enjoyed reading it and it is extremely helpful.
2,Not much fun,I purchased this toy after having many of the Calico items. This particular one is not much fun for my granddaughter nor does it keep her interest.
4,Those Damn Dirty Ants!,"Charleton Heston plays a plantation owner who battles a horde of ants threating to destroy everything he has. Actually, his main battle is with his wife-by-proxy Elonore Parker. She's ravishing, red headed and strong willed. At first I thought this was a 'nature-run-amok' tale. It is, but unlike movies of the 50s, this is not campy. No giant bugs, just real ants. No science fiction, but based on true stories. But at the center of the story is a love story. An old fashioned love story with ants. A great way to pass a rainy day."
5,The Naked Jungle,Another great Heston movie of the period. Good action and acting. I love the movie.
1,it's an okay movie,"wouldn't ya know Lisa Kudrow is in it, i was shocked, but if your a Jason Priestley fan, it's not really worth it, because he's only in it in the first 10 min., but this movie is about a bunch of screen writers who are trying to come up with a story, based on one's idea, not too interesting."
4,Thank You Todd Rundgren,If it weren't for Todd Rundgren's production we would be hiring Mark Farner to install our aluminum siding.Rundgren's production brought out what musical ability the band had and made them respectable.
4,Great music; sound not quite what I expected,"I've had this album since it came out on the yellow vinyl in 1973, so I knew the music would be good. This is one of Grand Funk's best works, but I only gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5.I was a little disappointed with the sound on the original album cuts. Since it is a remastered CD, I thought the sound would be better, but I found that I have to really punch up the bass and treble to get the best sound here.The sound quality is better on the bonus tracks. The acoustic version of Stop Lookin' Back is outstanding, not quite what you'd expect from GFR, but really showcases Farner's acoustic guitar skills, something you don't get to hear very often. Hooray and The End are good songs, but I'm not sure why they even added the 2002 remix of We're An American Band, it is lifeless and anemic compared to the original 1973 version."
3,"After the Fire is good, wholesome reading","After the Fire is a book about life, death and love. It connects the older age group with the younger, showing what can be learned from someone with life experience. This book is wholesome reading anyone will enjoy."
1,Did not work,I bought the game for my son and it did not work it was so disappointed they send me something that wasn't any good so that's why I gave it all already thank you very much
1,SAME PROBLEM.......,".....SOLES DISINTEGRATED IN LESS THAN 5 WEARS. -AND I WASNT JOGGING IN THEM, I WORK AT A DESK ALL DAY. SENT THEM BACK TO JOHNSTON AND MURPHY FOR A REPLACEMENT. HOPEFULLY THE NEW PAIR WONT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS. BUT AFTER READING ONE OF THE TWO OTHER POSTS, I AM NOT HOPEFUL."
1,Do NOT buy this printer!!,"Same problem, same story. Clogged ink, buying expensive cartridges, and trying head cleaning to try and fix the problem, no help from Epson... Just bought another Epson before checking these reviews and I'm thinking about returning it because I'll probably have the same problem in about a year. Some other gripes:- I had some problems with the Macintosh scanning software that is included. You have to download a separate patch for it to work.- If you run out of color ink, you have to buy more even if you only want to print in black and white.- Big and bulky.Repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!"
2,same problem as everyone else,"I'm chiming in because I too had an Epson CX 5200 crap out after about 1 year of use. I wish I'd read the reviews here before now because I would have contacted Epson tech support long ago if I knew this was a common complaint. As someone else mentioned, Epson will replace the 5200 with a 5400 for free (and send shipping labels, etc., with the replacement so you can send the old unit back). I don't know how well the 5400 does, but it's better than a printer that prints blank pages. And if it's a dud too, I'll gripe to Epson immediately for another replacement or a refund. So folks, don't get stuck with this lemon -- call Epson support and get the free replacement that is your due!"
1,CLOGGED PRINTER,Don't buy this CX5400. It worked great at first then the yellow clogged which was an ORIGINAL EPSON CARTRIDGE!. I wish I had seen these reviews before buying. I wouldn't have bought it! I'll stick with CANON which I also have - which has been printing excellent for over a year now. No problems with the CANON at all.
1,I wish we could rate on a scale of 0 to 5...,"...because I would definitely give it a 0. Please, please, do NOT buy this printer. It has been way more trouble than it is worth and after reading all of the other testimonies I'm even more frustrated. I too have had my Epson CX 5400 for a year and started having problems with it when I changed 3 of the ink cartridges. I've tried countless head cleanings and nozzle checks and have been repeatedly left with essentially blank pages (the little black dots that do appear are such a tease). I guess I'm another victim of clogged nozzle heads. Not even going to bother with the technical support...everyone else's reviews have me convinced that it is a complete waste of time and money. Curse you Epson!"
1,Worst Printer Ever!!!!,"DITTOS to the previous Jilted Customers review...Unfortunately, I had to spend over $170 on ink for Christmas Cards before finding out this printer was a lost cause. Less than 3 years no daily usage and it just completely stopped printing. Now we both I have the largest scanner taking up room you've ever seen. I'm beyond pissed. And will never buy or recommend purchasing Epson Products...I'll be sticking with HP from now on."
1,"Great, for a while","My Epson CX5400 stopped working about 6 months after I bought it. The inkjets are clogged, and no amount of using the clean utility will fix them. This seems to be a common Epson problem."
1,It Uses TOO MUCH INK,I can't believe how often I need to change the cartridges in this machine.I don't use the printer often...possibly once or twice a month ...let's put it this way....I estimate changing the cartridges after every 50 to 75 sheets of paper...depending of course upon amount of print on each page.I think what bothers me most is that I read the reviews before I bought this machine and they were all great...4 and 5 stars....but now...a couple of years later I notice that the TRUE reviewers have stated their minds and the TRUE rating is reflected. I wonder if companies have people writing false reports when these items first come out....hmmmm...it sure seems so in Epson's case here.
3,"Great, but have had a recurring problem with the CX5200","I currently own the Epson Stylus CX5200. I love the print quality and the all-in-one functions, however I continue to have the same problem over and over. The clear ink purge tube on the cap assembly continues to pop off therefore not allowing the black ink to get to the printer. This is my second CX5200 because Epson replaced the first one, which did the same thing. I was told that this is a design problem. I am so frustrated at this point that I am considering another brand, which is a shame b/c except for this problem, I really like the printer."
1,CX 5400 Clogged printer head problems,"I first purchased a CX5200 Epson all-in-one. Started having problems within one year -- clogged print heads. After Epson first refused to do anything about it even though the thing was under warranty, they finally agreed to replace it. Epson sent me a new CX5400, which of course I was happy about at the time. They would not warrant the CX5400 because it was a replacement for the 5200. Now I really know why. It went bad within a year as well. Clogged print heads -- again. When it did work, I liked the print quality, and I feel it scans well. That's why I gave it a ""1"" rating. Or was because there isn't an option for a ""0"" rating? Dennis"
1,Waste Of Money,"I've always owned epson printers. Ever since my first computer way back when, and as a general rule, I've always been pleased with them. That all changed when I got this printer. The paper feeder jambed up and broke after 9 months. They begrudgingly replaced it after several phone calls and then 14 months (just two months after it wasn't covered) I ran into the same problem everyone else did with this printer. Based on my research, this ink tube problem with the Magenta is rather common. You'd figure Epson would do a recall or something, but no, and they seemingly don't care about it either. They were/are aware of the problem with this particular printer but refuse to do anything about it. After being treated like dirt by their tech support, I've decided not to give them any more business. I switched over to Canon printers after this miserable experience and I couldn't be happier.You can check out the whole story here --> [...]"
1,Waste of money!!,"In tune with the other negative reviews, the scanner first started getting vetical lines in everything scanned and then started showing low ink in the cartridges. I spent $48 for new cartridges and like other reviewers all I ended up with were blank pages. I was contemplating on what I was going to do, until I read the reviews. Get a new printer is the only answer and obviously not an Epson."
1,Don't expect it to work beyond 1 year,"This printer worked great within the first year. The photos were good quality, the scanner produced good images, basically, I was very pleased. Recently, I replaced the ink cartridges and nothing. I went through the ""cleaning"" process about 15 times, still nothing. I did some research on the web and it seems this printer has problems with the print heads clogging/drying up. I've ordered a 3rd party cleaning kit to try to unclog the heads, but I could damage them in the process, but the printer doesn't print right now anyway, so what's the difference? The bottom line here is that I do not recommend this printer....stay away from this printer like the plague."
1,Another Ex Epson Owner,"I do not have the CX5400, but do own the CX4600 and experience the same printer cartridge clogging problems as many of the other commenters. I have also received a second printer from Epson and after about a year, here we go again. Tried head cleaning over and over and of course am about out of ink again. Still.... no success. Cannot print anything in black ink. I was told by Epson the first time that I shouldn't leave the printer on (someone else had also written that)so.... got the replacement and religiously turn it off after each use. Still.... no printing again after another year. I am currently researching printers for a replacement that's how I came upon this site."
1,Be warned,"I purchased this printer in January. Since then Epson has sent me 5 replacement printers. 3 had clogged ink heads, one had a problem with communication between the computer and the printer and one had a scanner issue. They only send out refurbished printers if you have a problem. They finally decided to upgrade my printer to the CX6400, but neglected to send the ink, paper support and feeder guard. I called and they then sent the WRONG ink and no feeder guard. It has been very frustrating."
2,lasted right up until the warranty expired . . .,"This was a good unit for the first year after we bought it. I used it as a printer, scanner AND copier, and did quite nicely. But as soon as the warranty expired, the heads on the color cartridges clogged up and no amount of cleaning them could fix the problem. I spent quite a bit of money on all new cartridges, thinking that this might help. Nope. I just hate it when equipment implodes when the clock ticks one minute past warranty. The Epson people were helpful when I called them, but I still have to buy a new printer."
1,Not worth bring home,Don't waste your time! And Lord help you if you ever need a cartridge...FORGET IT!!
1,Good scanner but dead printer,"yup .. just like everyone else said, this piece of junk decides to stop printing around 2 years after the first ink cartridge is installed. Don't bother buying new catridges, the tubes are jammed and there's no way to fix it. Just do a google or yahoo search for cx5400 and you'll see a thread from fixyourownprinter or something of the sort. I'd be surprised if ANY of these printers are stil printing after 3 years. On the other hand, my Canon i470D prints like it was fresh out of the box 4 years later !!! And ink cartridges are less than 2$"
3,"Looks nice, hard to assemble","This desktop organizer looks nice, but putting it together took a very long time because the pieces were not aligned properly. For example, the grooves for the drawers were not big enough for the slats that go in them, so it required additional tools to file it - very time-consuming and frustrating. Also, the directions were poorly written and there is a certain order of assembly that is necessary, which requires taking it apart if you don't do it correctly. The finished product works, but it should have taken minutes to assemble, not hours!"
3,Not really what I expected...,"When I picked up Ill Nino's first album when it first came out, I was surprised on the style of music they put together. It was so good I even went to two of their concerts and met the band. When I heard that they were going to come out with a new cd, I wanted to get it immediately. Well, I think I should have waited and gave it some more thought. I say that because their new stuff isn't quite the same as their previous album. Sure, it still has the same elements as the last one, but this one is a little softer, something that I don't really have a liking for. But don't get me wrong, there are about 4-5 songs that are hard and fast! It's amazing, but I was a little dissapointed with most of the songs being soft. I give this album 3 stars and its worth a listen to, only if you were a fan of before."
1,Ill Nino follows the numetal trend,"Ill nino decided to go the ever popular route of having a decent first cd and then going for the radio/trl single on the next. Revolution is worth getting, dont waste your time on this one unless you like stuff like the deftones and godsmack. If you want a heavy band stick with eighteen visions, lamb of god, chimaira, and killswitch engage. Ill nino has turned to crap"
1,"Lame book, badly written","A pretty lame book. Bill Barnes' ""Paintball! Strategies & Tactics"" is much better"
2,works as a good lip balm,"works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips, wouldnt buy it again."
3,Almost 4 Stars,"Really wonderful story & memorable characters fell into campy predictability and didn't recover. Sigh. Such potential got flushed away on ridiculous caricatures (why was Diamond always so angry? don't look in the book -- it's not to be found there; Stone's character simply deteriorates further & further to the point of painful idiocracy). I still loved the main characters, Grace & Boone (signature, formulaic Deborah Smith protagonists), especially the depiction of Grace's grieving, but I have a desperate need to revise the last 50 pages, which were forced & contrived. I will not despair ... I do love Ms. Smith's humor and word-smithing, so I will try another one of her books :) Bless her heart."
3,Not up to par,This book was very hard for me to get through. I didn't think it would ever end. It was not very realistic and choppy in parts. It definitely was not up to par when compared to her other books such as Sweet Hush. I would not rcommend it to anyone that I know.
5,A little dose of inspiration,"Hal Higdon is one of the first names I heard when I started running. He's a true expert in a sport that can benefit anyone-no matter who you are.I'm a pretty slow runner, but I like this book because it's welcoming. Higdon has helped thousands of people finish their first marathon and this book is putting years of experience on paper.It's friendly even to beginners, and presents very specific ways to train for a marathon. It's idiot-proof and very, very forgiving.This book is also a big shot of motivation, as well! Every time you pick it up it makes you want to go for a run-work toward that goal. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Not just people who want to run marathons, either-because it gives tips helpful for any runner from nutrition to clothing to pace and keeping yourself mentally in the game."
5,Great running resource,"This is a great book for beginning and experienced marathoners alike. It provides history, motivation, and a complete guide for everything from completing a first marathon to attaining a PR. Higdon has done a great job updating editions to keep up with nutrition products, such as gels and sport drinks."
4,A bit unlike the movie track,"This is just a small note to those considering to buy the album. The music in this album does not sound quite the same as the original soundtrack of the movie(s) (of which I've only seen the first, so my opinion is solely based on that). It seems to have been re-recorded with a much smaller ensemble of choir singers and a smaller organ, giving it a bit flimsy sound. Also, some essential bass notes seem to have gone missing, which further reduces the impact of this music.Don't get me wrong. It's a great album and I'm really glad they finally released this."
2,What Happened?,"GFR simply sold out on this one (and every album after that just got worse). I gave 2 stars for ""Flight of the Phoenix"" because at least it had a small taste of pre-Craig Frost GFR. My god GFR could rock the house down in their day, but this one was a sorry disappointment from the first time I bought it on vinyl back in the day. If you loved GFR's music that was recorded before this album, then don't bother buying Phoenix. You will be as disappointd as I was then and now."
5,Lost favorite,"I've been a Funk fan since 1969 when I was 12 years old. Some how I lost contact with this album. I recently bought the remastered edition, I sure am glad I did. This, in my opinion, is one of the best Grand Funk albums."
4,okay outdoor shower at low price,"The wide shower head is nice, although it doesn't spread outward which I'd have liked a little better. Depends on personal preference. Really is a good rain shower type of flow anyhow, instead of being concentrated at the top then spreading out like smaller ones might do, so it covers your head.The ability to put a ballast (I used 50/50 water/antifreeze in mine) into the base is practically a must.Something to watch out for is waterline pressures. I have a backyard line that bypasses the front (home) line and is at around 70 to 80 PSI. Almost knocked the shower over when I turned it on. I've added a pressure regulator operating at 40 to 50 PSI which I got at Wal-Mart, in the RV section (for RV water line hookups, garden hose type), and it's perfect now.All in all, aside from all the cheap plastic stuff (showerhead is chromed plastic), I think it's worth the price. However, I'm not expecting it to last for too many years."
1,"Low quality, plastic parts","Except for the 3 pipes, all parts are brittle plastic, including all fittings and shower head. I don't expect this to last through the summer without breaking. The joint between the base and the shower pipe is plastic, which looks like it will easily break. Because of this, I tied the top of the shower pipe to a tree to take stress off this joint."
4,"Good mix of Techno, and rock with a little rap thrown in","First off this was a great movie. If you have not seen it yet make sure to check it out. The soundtrack has a few stand out tracks, which for me include the Cult's ""painted on my heart"", Moby's ""flower"", Apollo 440's ""stop the rock"" and the Chemical Brother's ""leave home"". Stangely missing from the soundtrack was the Crystal Method's ""busy child"" which was also featured in the movie. The rest of the tracks fit the movie well, and are atleast worth listening to a few times."
5,I love this soundtrack,This is the perfect soundtrack to listen to while dreaming about being in a speeding car being chased by the Police. The up-beat music is perfect for getting your adrenaline glands working overtime. Nice Job!
4,"A CD worth ""Jacking""!","I loved the CD. I actually bought it because I am a fan of Nicolas Cage, but I enjoyed the music. I think that the Ice Cube song is the song most relevant to the soundtrack since it deals with his being car jacked at the end. Painted On My Heart by The Cult is also a good fit because it is pulse pounding. SPeaking of pulse pounding music, DMX's song rocks. I am a fan of CItizen King so that was an added bonus. This sountrack is one of the few that follows the theme of the movie. My only problem was Da Rockwilder; I did not think that it fits well with the energy or theme of the movie. All said, this CD is worth ""Jacking""!"
4,Solid Support Album,"Solid album supporting a really good movie. The music is all good and most of it is recognizable from the film, especially the cult's ""Painted on my heart"" the one tune not on the soundtrack that kept this from getting a 5 star review is low-rider...not sure what they were on when they signed off on the soundtrack without it on there, but I hope it was good stuff."
3,Music meant for the big screen,"The soundtrack itself is rather good, but the clips used in the movie at the moments they were, were well, perfect. Rap and techno come together to make up almost the entire album, a much different take on music then with most car chase films. Moby's ""Flower,"" starts off the flick with a truly amazing feeling and successfully gives that same feeling on the soundtrack itself. Citizen King and Groove Armada help keep the soundtrack moving, though its mediocre overall."
5,Awesome music for an awesome movie,"All of the songs on this CD are amazing. They're full of energy, just like the movie. They're also all very unique and unusual. See the movie, get the soundtrack."
3,"""Low Rider"" MIA?","Nope, I hear it is the ""hidden"" bonus track on the soundtrack, has anyone found that? -K8"
2,what were they thinking?,"I can't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of S$#!?*&%#!#$!There are a couple good ones,but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d,not even at a used price.I can't believe they did'nt put ""Low Rider"" on the soundtrack,how cheap is that?"
1,Il manque LA toune principale !!!,"La chanson que Nicolas Cage demande qu'on fasse jouer, juste avant de commencer les vols des voitures... Elle ne se trouve pas sur la soundtrack... Je la cherche, je ne la trouve pas !!! Quelqu'un saurait-il quelle est cette chanson et qui la chante ??? Peut-tre pourrez-vous m'aider ! Merci !"
1,Worthless Reading and Information,"I was highly disappointed in the content of this book. I was expecting so much more. About the only interesting portion of the book was the section on the Mondavi home. Other than that, it stinks. This is not even worthy of coffee table book status. My suggestion: Save your money and don't purchase it; instead treat yourself to a coffee at the bookstore."
5,Invaluable,"I was first given this book by a blind judge who thought I needed to understand the concepts within prior to commencing psychotherapy. I have since used it in many papers to discuss issues of disability, sexual orientation, and addiction. The concepts also resonate with clients."
5,Monterey Full/Queen Cherry Headboard,"Beautiful headboard. Went together nicely! Looks great. Great for keeping alarm clock, books or whatever you want handy."
3,"Sweet, but too short","This book is just fine for someone who wants to crack the surface on these canines, but is lacking for anyone wanting significant information. After all, a book can cover only so much information in a mere 22 pages! The pictures, however, are very nice, and the smaller boxed text (there are five) are interesting. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a wealth of information on Coyotes, Foxes, and Wolves, keep looking - this book has little that could not be found in any decent book on the subject."
5,Best Popcorn,"This popcorn is the best we have ever tried. Almost all the kernels pop, leaving the bag bursting full. Good flavor, natural ingredients."
5,ultimate,"I had this cd back in 1995 when it was titled ""Ultimate beats & breaks"" produced by PARIS on his scarface imprint. This is a collection of almost every breakbeat you can think of. Mainly for use as a production tool for samplers this is a very good collection. Similar breakbeat cd's can sell for $99 and up and you still don't get the quantity of loops this one has to offer. So cop this one if you can find it!"
4,"Good,except the first song","This collection is good considering the fact that Tammy's songs are best sung by her{or with George}.This cd has one special cut,In My Room,sung with Brian Wilson.Not only is it a touching song written by Brian,and it is from the discarded sessions of The Beach Boys ""Stars And Stripes Vol.2},which never were completed,but it is one of Tammy's last studio recordings before she died.That said,the opening cut of Elton John singing ""Stand By Your Man' was a mistake from the start.If this was done as a joke about his sexual preference,it is not funny.If this was to be taken as a serious inclusion,it is just plain creepy.What were they thinking about when they made this tribute?Tammy Wynette...Remembered"
2,Didn't Work For Us,"This container is durable and fits in the spot we wanted it to. It is located in the bottom of one of our pantries. The problem with this, is that my dog is able to get the top open, despite the zipper closure. I'm not sure how she does it, but twice now, when the pantry door has been left open, she has managed to also open the dog food container and eat herself sick. Literally. Two trips to the vet and more than $300 later, we're going with something else."
2,"Not ""critter resistant""","I've had this bin for about two years and I would not buy another nor would I recommend it. After I'd had the bin for less than two months, one of the two zippers stopped working. Since then I'd been using the remaining zipper without too much problem although it was often necessary to play with it a bit to close the bag. My dog food comes in 35 pound bags and it will not all fit in this container. I also recently discovered that mice had found their way to the bin and had nibbled a sizable hole right through the side of the container. So much for its claim to be ""critter resistant.""I give it two stars because it did, at least provide a place for me to store my dogfood."
5,From The Box...,"A rare look into the music and the minds of ten unique DJs. History, philosophy, battling, building a routing, body tricks, beat juggling, team routines. No matter what your skill level, this tape provides ideas, insights, and insights...."
1,ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCAM ARTISTS,"Benny Hinn is one of the biggest scam artists in the history of Evangelical Preaching. It isn't about God, its all about Benny! To turn around and to curse your enemies the way he does? THe bible says, ""love and pray for your enemies"" not curse them. ""Name it and claim it"".......but didn't our Lord pray in the Garden, ""not my will but thine be done""....I bought into this sham, saw the error of my ways and returned to my Catholic faith! Thank the Lord I did. May God have Mercy on Benny Hinn and forgive me for judging him."
1,"I liked Balki in ""Perfect Strangers"" better","Not to mention Steve Martin's imitation of Hinn (he really did pattern his character after Hinn) in ""Leap of Faith."""
1,What Is All The Fuss?,"If you're looking for ""confirmation"" of what you already believe in anyway (i.e., that your dear departed are lining up to make a long-distance call via Van Praagh), this is your book. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Van Praagh provides no reason to believe. Yeah, I know the cliche: ""To the believer no proof is necessary..."""
4,Talking to Heaven,"The book was very helpful in dealing whith the death of my daughter, knowing that she is still with me. I have read the book twice, and probably will read it again. I have order another copy for my friend to read, hoping it will bring him the confort it has brought me."
2,Nothing New Under the Sun,"""Talking to Heaven"" is a disappointing book. It is essentially just one more mediocre book in this highly popular genre. For those who have no exposure to the concept of life after death, it is all right as a very basic introduction, but for those who have explored the topic and want something more than just basics, it's one of those 'been there, read that' books. It doesn't giver very many case histories, and there are no revelations, earth-shattering or otherwise. It left this reader wondering what purpose the writer had, other than self-promotion (he's for hire, folks)."
1,Garbage for minds that are too open,"This book is filled with total nonsense. It may provide some with a feeling of ""happiness"", but it is a false hope that has no real meaning or significance. There is nothing wrong with spiritualism, but there is something definitely wrong with scamming innocent people with lies and falsehoods. Van Praagh may not be a crook by law, but to any rational, critically thinking person his work is repugnant. This book is no different - avoid it at all costs, lest it whither your mind like a mushroom in an oven."
5,"It was wonderful, I would love to have a sitting with James",James's book is well written. I lost my Dad to a sudden heart attack when I was 11 years old. I believe that James can speak with those who have passed over. The stories he shares make things so clear. It all makes sense. I hope to someday meet James and have a sitting with him.
3,Bread maker,"I have had this Panasonic breadmaker for several weeks after using and wearing out 2 other brands. There has been trial and error, and it really is necessary to measure the flour by weight not by cup. It makes a very large loaf even using the sandwich directions, but it is a light and well formed loaf. I have only tried the white bread so far."
1,I just hate it!!,"Well I read a lot of the reviews of this bread machine and I needed one as my Regal Kitchen Pro died. I had it since 1992 and make a lot of bread and pizza dough. Well reading the booklet, the weights to make bread are weird. Since when am I to measure 4 7/16 cup of flour. Really, 7/16 cup!! So, any way I am sending it back. Also, I made a pizza dough and it was a gooey mess!! Almost like dough soup!!"
5,Great Bread Macine,"This Panasonic Bread Machine is just great, far superior to my old one. This purchase was made to replace our ten year old breadmachine.The bread never sticks to the pan. It is quiet and does the job efficiently. It is a good investment and easy to use. I followed the advice of other people who had posted here and use King Arthur Bread Flour. As a result we have very good tasting bread.Just put the ingredients in, follow the directions, and in 4 hours you have a large loaf of white bread, using the Basic Recipe. French bread which is delicious takes 6 hours. I have also made the whole wheat and multi grain bread.I heartily recommend this Panasonic Bread Machine."
5,Wonderful,"We have made around 5 loaves in our bread maker, wheat, orange/cranberry, cinnamon raisin, etc. and everytime we comment on how EASY and delicious the bread is. Absolutely worth picking up. Loaves slip right out with out sticking, only wish could do something about the size/shape more of the loaves but hey whatever warm , fresh bread is sooooo yummy!"
4,Very Good,Works well so far. I usually bake whole grains and use Bobs Red Mill mixes. It has done a real nice job making those breads. Easy to use I really like this bread maker.
2,Not nearly as simple as my old one from 1993 !,Amazon just zapped everything I'd just written when I tried to change my rating! I wish I still had my old one from 10 years ago!
5,Best Bread Machine Ever,I have used 5 different bread machines. I have almost always had two. The first one was a gift. We have had our Panasonic bread machine at least 7 years. It is the best. We have used it almost every other day. Finally it wore our and the yeast didn't drop any more. We started putting the water in first and the yeast on top like most bread machines and it still works as good as new. Before the water was put in last but the yeast drops after the machine warms up. I wouldn't have another brand. They cost more than some bread machines but Panasonic is well worth it.
1,"Makes good bread, but breaks after 1 year!","First off, this bread machine makes excellent bread. My wife and I bought the SD-YD 250 in March of 2007 and have used is steadily for the past year. We grind our wheat using a hand-crank stone grinder, which tends to make a slightly denser loaf than all-purpose or bread flour. Week after week, this machine has produced excellent bread and dough. Unfortunately, it is now March of 2008 and the machine fails to mix the dough properly. We just tried making pizza dough and to our utter disappointment, the dough was unmixed and stuck to all sides of the pan and the motor was making an awful squeaking noise. I called panasonic and we are past our 1-year warranty, so I'm currently researching other bread machines to replace this one. For the excess of $100 dollars I paid, I really expected this product to last longer. I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing this bread machine if you plan on using it for more than 1 year."
1,crust setting is broken...,"I tried with several recipe and crust setting light and medium, but the bread always comes out super dark. Repaired once, but they did not fix it. Contacted customer service, they refused to refund or replace the machine. I am very disappointed with this machine and Panasonic."
1,"Broke under warranty, have to pay shipping to get it fixed","IMHO, it is not a good idea to buy these types of appliance via Amazon. The box was received crushed and one setting (crust) did not work from the start. The machine stopped working altogether and now I have to ship it via UPS or FEDEX to the closest Panasonic repair shop, which is nowhere near my home. I have to pay for shipping BOTH WAYS. It is now going to cost more than if I had just purchased it locally."
5,Bread Machine replacement,Our Bread machine from about 20 years ago broke and we decided on the Panasonic as a replacement. This was a very wise choice! It makes wonderful bread and so far I would give it 5 stars.Thanks to all the great reviews we are glad to have made the purchase.
4,Quiet breadmaker,"This Panasonic bread maker is great for making bread in Large, XL, or Medium and from light to dark loaves. The only problem I have is with the recipes. How does a person measure every thing in 7/16 or 3/ 16 ounces. Using the cup and spoon that is with the bread maker is not always helpful in measuring. Learn how to do the 16th and your loaves will be delicious. I hate doing math when cooking!!( I would rather have the Cups and TBS or Tsp measurement."
2,Must have bought a lemon,The breadmaker worked great for about 2 months and then died. The motor and the heating element went out at about the same time. I can't get Panasonic to do anything about it. They gave me a local repair center that never would call me back (called several times). I called the main office again and they transfer me over and over and say they will call me back. They found a service center that would repair it but still haven't given me instructions on getting it repaired. They keep saying they will call me back.
1,SUCKS,"all was well until I plugged the machine in, and found it already set to bake an extra large loaf over four hours, AFTER I loaded it with ingredients for a medium sized loaf and enough yeast to rapid bake. Too bad, tuff cookies, you can't reset it once it's set to bake, so I now have to wait on it to run through a four hour cycle with nothing in it, hoping my unmixed ingredients hold up in the fridge until I can actually bake, because I don't WANT an extra large loaf, and I don't WANT to wait four hours to know if it came out right. Dumb, illogical, stupid, pointless feature, a mark of incompetent design. If it wasn't a gift I'd be boxing it the heck up to get my money back, because I can't abide by this stupidness..."
5,Panasonic SD-YD250 Breadmaker a winner,"Just finished a Corned Beef on my home made Rye and it was great. Feel a little more independent being able to make such a wide variety of bread in my own kitchen. With bread often selling for $5.00 and not really knowing the ingredients, I can now make my families bread easily and more economically that in the recent past.Thanks"
4,Very good so far,"Very good so far, give 4 stars because the durability has not been proved.Esp likes the french bread. Just need to remember you need to start in the morning before you go to work..."
1,Don't throw your money away...,"I ordered the Panasonic SD-YD250 breadmaker for my wife for Christmas. The irony was that my Mother in Law bought her one too - the Emeril bread machine. Little did I know that the Panasonic would break after using it 3 times. BTW, the Emeril still works to this day!(updated)Working with Panasonic for warranty service was a nightmare. Their Dallas based service provider first lost our shipment (lucky I sent it signature), then claimed that it was out of warranty. They shipped it back to me...and it was someone else's old unit. I tried to escalate a couple of times, but noone would help. This product is the worst and the service behind it is criminal. I strongly suggest you pass on Panasonic bread makers."
5,"So far, so good","I just received the Panasonic bread maker, having ordered it after reading several good reviews. I have only made one loaf of Basic White Bread with it, but that came out marvelously! The crust was crispy and the insides were tender. I followed the basic setting, which takes 4 hours from beginning to end. I will try the Rapid Bake next. It was very easy to use, and based on my experience, I'd recommend it to others."
1,What is going on with price,"I was thinking to buy this item for 107$ with free shipping, but now it's 151$, during day it's changing from 107 to 151... But 4 stars from me, because my coworker using it, and she is happy with this bread maker"
2,"Ordered twice, received broken bread maker both times","I ordered this Breadmaker on Amazon after doing some research and figuring out that it would be the best deal for a bread maker.First breadmaker did not turn on at all, LCD screen worked, but nothing else would work. So I ordered a replacement from Amazon.The second breadmaker was cracked on top. The bread maker was sent in the original box and had no other extra packaging. Very poor job packing the breadmaker. Waste of time, so I just got the refund."
2,Breadmaker,"This is my 3rd Panasonic Breadmaker. The design of this unit is essentially the same as the last 2 (discontinued support for parts) but I have about a 25% success rate in making bread, I'd like to return the unit for exchange of for another brand that works. What say you??"
5,Great Great Great!,"This is a great machine! I used to use an other brand's bread machine, but was tired of baking rock-like hard bread. I wanted to eat Japanese soft milk bread in US, and found that many Japanese bloggers living in US baked pretty decent bread with this machine. I am completely happy to have this machine! The yeast dispenser of YD250 makes baking bread easy and perfect! I also found a simple but perfect recipe from Japanese cooking site. If you like soft light crust, I recommend to push the stop button 10 minutes before the machine finishes baking."
2,burns bread and lousy instructions,"I was so excited to get an ""upgraded"" breadmachine after using Breadman machines for years. I was patient with my new Panasonic for the first 5 or 6 loaves and after calling support I still can't bake a good loaf of whole wheat or multigrain bread. I live at a high altitude so I made the changes needed. The bread was better but the crust is always burnt. I can't afford to toss it so I guess I will just use the dough cycle and bake it in the oven, which I had to do with the last loaf which came out okay after all the screwing around with it and wound up having to take it out of the bread pan and kneading it myself. I guess I added too much water which is what high altitude calls for. It was a mess. I hope this thing doesn't last a long time because I will go back to my Breadman which at least was simple to use. The instruction booklet says absolutely nothing about high altitude baking or burnt crusts. It's a piece of crap!"
3,Underpowered,"I bought this bread machine and after making 3 100% whole wheat loaves I had to send it back because it just seemed to underpowered to handle the 1.5 pound dough. I really wanted to like this machine but was disappointed. I tried 3 different recipes to make sure it wasn't the recipe and also tried 2 different types of whole wheat flour. Oh well. I ordered the book ""Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day"" from Amazon and I am very happy with the bread that can be made using this fast/easy method. Thanks.Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking"
4,Bread machine virgin,"I promised myself that I would write my own review on this product, having pored over several helpful reviews before making my selection. I have been using this machine consistently for a few months now, and can honestly say that it bakes a pretty mean loaf of bread and is VERY easy to use (I'm especially partial to the French loaf). The only issues I have had with it have been: forgetting to add the yeast (user error) and every now and then, the paddle gets stuck in the bread when you shake the loaf out. Another tip - don't do what I did and try to dig the bread out of the metal container using a knife or a metal implement; the walls of the metal 'basket' have a very thin teflon coating that is easily scratched. Just a good shake does the trick. Buy it."
3,What about gluten free,"Good machine, however it clearly lacks a gluten free setting, other than that it performed well the first time w used it."
2,aweful! don't buy not worth your time!,"Makes great bread....at first. Failed us within a month, went into smoke and almost flames."
1,Beware - Had 3 of these one after the other,"The first model i got was all dented from shipping, i decided to use and bread came out flat. I replaced it through amazon and the second model had no external dents but the internal oven was disconnected or hanging and i was afraid to use it. Thge third model had large dent in fron but looked ok. My wife and I followed the directions to a T, and the bread came out flat. We decided to bake one more loaf and when i went to put in the yeast the yeast from the first batch was still in there, it never dispensed. Biggest Hassle and waste of time. Poor workmanship, cover feels like it will rip off. Very very poor product packing"
1,Think twice about this movie!,"Anyone who's read the book will be profoundly disappointed with this movie because all the significant issues [e.g., the reason for Philippa's avoidance of Elspeth (sister Cecily in the book, Sr. Joanna in the movie); the relationship with Elspeth & the choir director--forgot this sister's name, etc) never happen in the movie. It's unbelievable that all these incidents were left out & the movie hooked (not wove!) tiny pieces of some incidents without giving any relationship or connection to the characters. A fabulous story which would've been an epic movie was ruined to become absolutely NOTHING!! I'm sorry I bought it & glad I didn't pay $45 or so for it. What a waste of good acting by a very good cast, but even they couldn't save a movie which really has no story whatsoever!"
4,Harmonia - 'Deluxe' (Universal) import CD,"I just had to go back and listen to this release and previously I may have given it a three star rating,but now I have discovered that it's nearly AS GOOD as the band's 1st lp 'Music Von'.As 'Deluxe' was originally put out in 1975,it most certainly displays some of Michael Rother's somewhat dominating guitar work,on a few of the tracks anyway.Starts off with the title cut,which reminds me of the 'Neu! 75' lp but also lets me know what might've very well influenced the music on the first two Gary Numan albums.""Walky Talky"" is pretty decent with Guru Guru drummer Mani Neumeier as guest.""Monza"" has the synth work over floating it's boundries.Chalk up yet another genius effort for the Rother,Moebius and Roedelius team.'Deluxe' would be best described as experimental mind music.Will appeal to fans of Faust,Cluster,Can,Neu! and early Guru Guru."
2,okay to a point,I've never liked any of E.Lynn Harris's books but was convinced to check this one out because it's a biography. The story of Harris's childhood is genuinely heartbreaking (the Easter Sunday scene made me furious) but the rest is just dull. He jumps over too much. Since only 1/3rd of the book is engaging it's not something I'd tell a friend to buy.
4,Girls love this for the doll house,My four year old loves to play with the different sets that go with the Loving Family Doll house. The sets are decorated with detail and she notices that. She really enjoys getting a new set to add to the house.
1,Old product.,The expiration date on the packets was just 7 months from when I received it. Uncool to dump your old inventory on people.
4,"Perfect for my needs, but some packets are nearly impossible to open!","I bought these to keep in my two cars. As a guy (who does not carry a purse...) I got tired of never having any if I got a small headache while I was out running errands. I think the individual packets will allow them to with stand the climate changes that occur by being left in the car 24/7.They came in 50 packs of 2 advil each. The expiration date was about 14 months away.The only problem I have with these are some of the packs are very difficult to open. I understand childproofing...But I literally have to use scissors on a couple of them.Overall, these fit my needs and I will buy this same item again when I need more."
5,Solidify your understanding,"This is not the book to dive into first if you want to really get .NET. It's actually a fairly interesting mixture of what I now consider obvious and what I never stopped to consider. If you are just starting out, I would begin with Richter's book, and then digest this one quickly afterwards. There is a significant amount of overlap, but your final understanding will be very balanced."
2,"Educationally poor, technically unimpressive","If you want to be expert in any of the fields that this book purports to clarify, I suggest you consult the experts."
3,Cumple con su cometido,buscaba una memoria para satisfacer la capacidad de fotos asi que opte por esta memoria que el precio lo encontre razonable
5,SanDisk SDCFH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II CompactFlash Card,I was amazed with the saving compared with the retail stores.
4,SanDisk Ultra II,"I am using this card, a 1 GB unit, in a Canon 20D dSLR. I paid $89.95 for it. I typically photograph wildlife (birds and other relatively slow moving critters) and have not had the need to use my camera in burst mode yet. Instead, I do a lot of single shot exposures. In this paradigm, I do not notice much difference between the SanDisk Ultra II and the Kingston Elite Pro 2 GB card, for which I paid about the same price ($99.00). Both cards have performed well in my application. My only complaint about the SanDisk, and it is a minor one, is that I occasionally have some trouble inserting the card into my camera. It seems to slide in roughly compared to the other two cards I currently own (the Kingston and a 512 MB Lexar 80X Professional series card)."
5,Great Card,I've been using these for some time now and have never had a single problem. I also use the 2GB and 4GB Ultra II cards. Here again I have yet to have any problems with any of these cards. I don't hesitate to recommend them.
1,Worst Falcon Guide Ever,"I own 22 Falcon hiking guides. This thing is horrible. First few pages talks about how it is not designed to make it easier to hike in the Rocky Mountains NP. And it doesn't. It's obviously written by one of those guys who wanted to get paid for writing the book, but doesn't want you on his trail. You know what I am talking about if you have read a dozen or so hiking guides. This dreadful thing is a 320 page continuous paragraph. I can't even tell where the new hike ends and where a new one begins. Don't know how long the trail is or what the elevation gain/loss. There is no chart describing the mileage/elevation throughout the trail that I have found in every other Falcon guide I ever purchased. I see now that if I had read the reviews first, I would not have made this selection. Since the return postage is probably more than the book costs, I am going to just burn it, stomp on it and make sure it is dead."
3,Other Books,"A novel about a book, in this case. In the story, The Seven Minutes is a book that has the explicit sexual thoughts of a woman. The novel details the society, legal ramifications and other hoo-hah surround its publication.Obviously a book of its time, but certainly has a couple of things to say about censorship and freedom of speech."
4,Excellant Narrative,"Built around a popular topic of pornography, Wallace tried defining the difference between artwork and pornography. Excellant writing craft by carrying the reader with the story without bringing him under the huge set of information used to build the trial. The very idea of the fictional work 'The Seven Minutes' which is the central charecter around which the whole story revolves is very attractive and artistic. The line between art and pornography is normally very thin and Michel Barret, the petty lawer who believes that this is an art work rather than hard pornography gives us excellant account of the topic in historical perspective."
3,Made for Public consumption,"This book was fun to read, unlike Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft which is so full of ""I'm so great"" rhetoric that it makes me want to retch. I read Scott Cunningham's Wicca:A Practical Guide for the Solitary Practioner first and loved it because it was so easy to read and didn't go into false promises or rituals that some man made up to get his jollies. This book is in the same vein, but made for the non-Wiccan. The magick in the book is watered down enough so that everybody can enjoy and not get nervous. The short stories read like a what-not-to-do handbook that every witch needs. It shows that everybody can make mistakes. The there were two bad things that it promotes their school over and over, and that it is missed named and misrepresented as a beginners guide to witchcraft which it definately isn't. That's why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars."
1,If you want to be Harry Potter,"This book was very boring, and had a lot of pointless stories about the authors in it. It also seemed to be targeted at silly teenagers who are interested in ""Wicca"" (quotes, because that's not really what they're interested in) only because they like to fantasize about spells that will make others do what they want. This is not Wicca at all. The worst part of this book even made me laugh-vampires, indeed!"
5,AmeriLeather leather Cell Phone/Fanny Pack,Purchased this for a friend and they love it! I would highly recommend it. The cell phone area would need to be larger for iphones.
4,Very Nice,"Good quality, nice size. I haven't been able to find something similar in the stores in leather so am pleased."
1,Not for small people,"The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips. I am a 5'6"" 120 lb. small boned female. The company offered to exchange it, however did not offer any others with cell phone holder. Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item. I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now."
5,Excellent product and makes a great gift.,I ordered the pack as a christmas present for my wife. She has been using it for the last few weeks and loves it. She has mentioned how roomy and stylish it is. She is very happy with it. Also wanted to mentioned that I ordered it about a week before christmas and it arrived just in time for me to wrap it and place under the tree!
2,Yawn...,"Disappointing series... The interviews are short without really revealing anything.. then they seem to stick the videos more as filler... Badly organized segments and TOO SHORT! If these were done mroe like VH1's Behind The Music format..it would Definately be worth buying and be a Real tribute to the stars...and What is up with Vol 3??! Arent Corina, Sweet Sensation, Noel, Johhny O, Safire... a litttle more famous than that line up?!?? lol"
3,"Good sound, convenient I/O box, but still has problems","The Good News: The hardware is all first rate. The I/O panel box is a wonderful and convenient. It looks good, and works very good.The Bad News: Unfortunately, Creative clearly employs freshman software school engineers. In the more than two years that Windows XP has been out, Creative STILL has not figured out how to write compatible software and drivers for XP and SP1. It is maddening and pure frustration should your system crash or freeze after doing the creative installation. Calling Creative for support is useless, hopeless. They are truly helpless. They do not have a clue! If by chance you manage to get the system running, you will find the hardware functions extremely well and the sound is gorgeous. Creative should simply contract out the software engineering to a competant firm and be done with it."
3,Jon Anderson saves the day in The Hymn,"YES man Jon Anderson saved this album with his appearance on The Hymn. Actually, the album is worth it for that tune alone. But any true Wakeman fan should get the work, simply because it's Wakeman."
1,Ridiculous book,"This book is not a book of facts, but rather a book of theories (stated as facts) based on half-cocked ideas by someone who is blantantly trying to explain God and Jesus Christ away, claiming that half, if not the whole Bible isn't true but merely fictional and mythological. I had to use this book as a textbook for my recent religious studies class, and it was just the worst book for this class. Instead of this book, why don't you check out ""The Case For Christ."" It is awesome!"
4,Collective Views,"I've read the book and enjoyed the different view points expressed within the text, composed of comments from the Forums......I have no idea, what this person is talking about....but being an African American woman myself.....I still experience some forms of racism, and no one can deny the progress made for our country, but I stand by the ideal, that there's more work for all of us to do....and this book opens that forum, for the continuation of meaningful discussions facing not just blacks, but people, and our humanity in general. Thanks for continuing to create a place for discussion, and thought provoking conversation.Alicia Boss"
5,The essence of Colette,"There are many Colettes, and I cherish them all. But the one dearest to me is the Colette who wrote so lovingly and voluptuously of her early years. In ""My Mother's House"" and ""Sido"" Colette writes about her family, her childhood in the country, and the creatures - human and otherwise - which informed those years.In her writing about these years, Colette describes the inner life of children, country life, and her parents and their odd, affectionate and often difficult relationship with each other and with their children. We have the sense of lives tied to the earth and the turn of seasons, particularly through loving descriptions of her mother, Sido.These two memoirs are not about ""not much"" as one reviewer puts it, they're about the sensuality of life, about enduring bonds of love and of blood, and about the education of a writer. Perfectly gorgeous work, and highly recommended."
4,Must have tool,Excellent tool if you are going to use a log method for either weight training or weight loss. Tracks the basic catagories well and requires only a couple of minuets a few times a day. Nice.
2,basic diary,"I think you could get more use out of a notebook and pen and paper...it has good basic information, but I have seen newer journals out on the market that would be better. It's a good size though!"
1,dave chappelle,i didnt like it at all it was really scratched up i wish it was cleaner because it would stop then play
4,eh,I believe this DVD had a skip that I didn't like so I never got to finish it. Something was wrong with this DVD because I only watched it once and never again. I just can't remember what it was.
3,Why bother buying this,"This is showed on Comedy Central every few weeks uncensored. Why bother buying it. In my opinion it is not his best comedic work. Fans of Chappeles Show probably won't like it(Frat Boys I mean not real fans), because they'll be expecting him to be saying his catch-phrases."
4,Chappelle is Funny,"I like Dave Chappelle alot. Ever since seeing his Wonder Woman routine back in the day, I've been a big fan. This special doesn't disappoint.Chapelle doesn't have as much energy as Chris Rock, but he does talk about many subjects that people can relate to. The sign of a good comedian is that you will repeat his stuff in your everyday conversations. I've found myself several times making references to his Fake People and Old Bad Guy voices. Very funny!"
3,high expectations?,"i'm a grandma raising my 18mth old as of one month ago. he came to me without any books so i bought quite a few. he loves to look at the Happy Baby books and can easily hold them but some of the words seem a bit advanced. maybe they are expecting too much or maybe i am expecting too little from my grandson. i dont think the books are bad, they are just not quite what i was expecting."
3,SICK moves but dosen't really help ur game!!,The dvd was great if u like mad blocks and dunks but if otherwise then it won't really be very good. I like it but it's not like they did to many great moves like the AND 1 mix tape.
1,"Stopped working, no parts available to fix it!!!","I did every cleaning and took care of it by the book, from the get go the warm feature didn't work, but now the ultrasonic plate doesn't work anymore, I know what to fix but they do not sell the parts. Too much money !!!!"
3,Bored by an angel,"The human-hating angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) is back, this time to prevent the birth of a nephilim, the offspring of a human and an angel that would combine the strengths of each.I have to admire a low-budget horror film that takes such pains to provide a philosophical underpinning to its story. Director / co-screenwriter Greg Spence and co-screenwriters Gregory Widen and Matt Greenberg appear to take their theology seriously. I just wish they could have dramatized it more effectively. The result is a fog of stalkings, car crashes, and beatings, culminating in a dull faceoff in an industrial park, replete with obligatory steam and rusty iron catwalks."
2,Not as good...,"This movie would hve been better had it not tried so hard. The cast is nowhere as interesting as the cast from the first, and the re-casting of Thomas Daggit (I don't care how small the role was), really bothered me. It has, of course, Christopher Walken at his over-the-top best, but even that doesn't save this loosely-plotted movie. Worth at least one viewing, and then go and watch the first one again."
2,It probably did no harm but didn't do what it claims it will.,I've finished the entire contents as directed and as a result there's been no difference as a natural libido enhancer for women.
3,You get what you pay for,"I've tried a lot of these. This one is pretty effective, but if you take the recommended 2 tabs, you dramatically decrease stimulation and orgasm is impossible. With one, meh, it's okay. There are way better ones."
3,Nothing really boosted...,"Due to medications I'm on my sex drive is incredibly low. I was, still am, in need of something to help boost it. This product was a great value, but it did not boost enough to tell a difference. Keep in mind, every body is different, so it may just not tolerate mine."
2,Stay focused when buying.,Always keep in mind that the places a person might purchase an item can quickly disappear. Finding replacement filters can be very hard. I feel lucky that Amazon carried this item. What I am unlucky about is the cost. Something is wrong when two filters cost more than the entire air cleaner. The filters should be half the cost of what I just paid. Way to expensive to maintain.
4,Addicting,"How many local bands can you name your self?Yeah thats what i though. I, being the homegrow seattle native myself, know the meaning of quality music. This album is the definition. The music is not only addiccting, but catchy at the same time. The ""pop"" quality is limited, so the vocals really stand out. It is the perfect mix of talent, personality, with a sarcastic appeal. so enjoy the music while it last, and if you can appreciate it for what its worth, you should really go see some more local shows"
1,the Divorce...ha,"You'd be hard pressed to find a bigger handful of posers. These guys are such wannabe 'rocker' hams, it's painful. This is one of the most terrible albums I've ever heard. These guys jump more bandwagons than Madonna. They pose more than Britney...In short...P'shah, these guys are painfully and embarrassingly contrived and lame!"
1,Thor,"might be an OK movie to occupy an 8 year old but I lost interest three minutes into it (it's that bad, and lets you know quickly that it's going to be)..."
4,Corny but I like it,This movie is quite corny and at times even stupid but I really like action hero movies. If you are a casual fan of such movies this one you might want to pass on.
5,luv it :),Dvd was delivered in one piece...viewed it...no issue...price was reasonable..so far im quite please..would definitely order more Dvd from here
1,Meh...,"This was way different from the comic. Thor is not supposed to remember who he is while he's on Earth (Midgard) If I remember correctly, he inhabits the body of some doctor or scientist but in the movie he knows who he is the whole time. This revolves about Norse mythology so I have no idea why they had a black actor and an asian play Nordic gods. Marvel is notorious for changing the races of characters for movies. Nick Fury gets a pass because he's black in the Ultimates, but older readers who haven't read a comic in decades would be annoyed by this. At least DC replaces a character who is white with a totally different character that is black. I know they did this to be politically correct, but could've used the black and asian actors to be Black Panther and Iron Fist, respectively. This movie doesn't beat the Iron Man franchise. If I want to have Avengers on my movie collection in the future, I guess I have no choice but to get this but I'll wait until it's in the dollar bin."
4,perfect,"no complaints, compared the price to stores in the area and Amazon is still the cheapest way of getting movies."
4,Love Chris Hemsworth,This movie would probably be a 3 star movie if it didn't have Chris Hemsworth in it. He is definitely a joy to watch. I'm smitten.
4,Fun action flick!,I enjoyed the movie. Good action. Great looking lead man! I look forward to seeing him again in The Avvengers! Item arrived as promised.
2,BEAUTIFUL IMAGES and NO STORY....,"well, THOR got many beautiful animations, and is really well done...but i think the story is not so inspired.....THOR may please the people who enjoyed HULK and CAPTAIN AMERICA, but the lack of inspiration on the story is huuuuuge....in fact, almost ALL the MARVEL movies are the same in this way.....Great images but no story...too bad, the MARVEL characters are TOTALLY CLASSIC!!!!!!stick with SPIDER MAN and X-MEN, the best from the catalogue of MARVEL movies....."
5,Easily a New Favorite,"All the Marvel movies I've seen lately have really impressed me, but Thor definitely stands out among them. It's the perfect mix of myth and modern. I'm not a big comic book reader so I can't tell you whether or not it stays true to the comics, but I can tell you it's a great action film. The plot is exciting and the acting is great! There's humor and romance tied into the story line, so even people who don't normally go in for action films can enjoy it. It's well written, with a lot of quotable moments. The villain keeps you on your toes, and his motives are definitely believable. I made my family sit down and watch it with me, and they all loved it too. Definitely a movie worth adding to your collection!"
3,"Fun movie, could have been great","Great acting and special effects, but the script was terrible. A good movie to see if you haven't. Great acting by Hemsworth, Portman, and the rest of her crew."
3,Entertaining when it wasn't boring.,I'm tired of evil (the Ice Men) characterized as (pick one) monsters or the Devil.I'm tired of intergalactic travel (or whatever it was) portrayed with noisy roaring machinery and flashing lights.Portrayal of purported government intervention was the same as every other sci-fi/fantasy portrayal of government intervention.But it was still entertaining on an otherwise sleepless night.
5,"this is the best movie by far; romance, strength, companionship and betrayal",i really get worked up with the excitement and the sadness as well... thanks again staff for bringing this order Pam
4,Nice release,"Loved the movie. I wasn't sure how well Thor would translate to the big screen, but to my delight it came out great. Hemsworth was good as Thor, but it was Loki that stole the show. Hiddleston made Loki more than a cardboard cutout. You understood why he felt like he did, even as you disagreed with what he was doing.The disc itself was good too. The movie looks great, and there are some decent extras."
3,Overdone and unrealistic,"I guess it was kind of what I expected, but I was hoping it would be a little more realistic - like the Batman movies or Spiderman with Toby McGuire."
1,Bored and laughing (in pain) 2 minutes into the movie,"Where do I start? Chris Hemsworth's acting was awful, the set was cheesy, and the writing was childish and predictable. Even Natalie Portman couldn't save the movie with her over-acting. Definitely one of the WORST movies I've seen in YEARS!"
1,Thor sucks,This was the worst super hero movie I have seen in a while. Green Lantern blows this away. What an overblown piece of crap. Don't waste your time
3,Not what I expected,It was more about the fight up there than down here . Not enough action on planet earth.I was expecting more action on planet earth. Well made not what I liked.
2,something is missing,"my review is different because I enjoyed the 3d quality and the movie was decent . my grip is with amazon.com sending me the limited 3d edition with no slip cover artwork. I called amazon.com and they sent an replacement the very next day and still no slip cover . if I go to target, walmart, best buy, or frys it comes with the slip cover . I have never had any issues or returns with amazon.com , but I wanted the slip cover artwork for collectors reasons . I kept the 2nd thor 3d blu ray without the slip and sent the 1st one back, but sooner or later I'll just get it again from best buy with the slip cover when it goes on sale. something so small but big in disappointment ."
2,Natalie Portman Wasted...,The middle portion of the film was enjoyable and I had hopes for the ending but we ended up with a lame villain battle and things sort of petered out.
1,Thoroughly underwhelming. Pun intended.,"Hotheaded Thor finds himself banished to Earth after an ill advised attack on...err..some villains whose ridiculous names escape me right now. Tossed away also is his hammer, but only after Odin puts a spell on it which makes the hammer impossible to wield unless a ""righteous"" ruler picks it up. Watch as in the span of two days Thor redeems himself, steps in and out of outfits, wields the hammer and lays a smack-down on his trickster, no good punk ""brother"" who has been more duplicitous than any of our Earthling politicians. Add to this some bombastic drum driven music that's usually found in Michael Bay's movies, a poorly used Idris Elba and one of the worst scripts around and you have ""Thor"". On the plus side, the actors do the most with the littlest and the guy who plays Thor is pretty charismatic."
3,predictable,"It was very predictable. There were a few funny spots though. Atleast the love story part of it was not drawn out. I watched the whole thing, hoping that it would get better....na, I just wanted to see Natalie Portman in a role other than in star wars. Don't waste your time unless you have a thing for Natalie Portman and brainless action with not too indepth plot."
4,loving it,"I love all super heros..was it oscar worthy?No way...just totaly entertaining. its always fun to watch a film with a funny, handsome, great body good guy...and pretty hot bad guy too..special effects great too"
2,Thor- good effects and a lousy script.,Thor- good effects and a lousy script. it could have been much better. I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see it.
2,It was Boring,Movie was boring and predictable. And costumes were super cheap-looking. I basicaly fell asleep thourghout the whole film.The movie couldn't been better.
4,Marvel does it again!,"Thor is one of those movies that has everything in it. It has great action scenes and some funny moments. The acting was very good, especially Christ Hemsworth(Thor) and Natalie Portman(Jane).Although you could see this in regular 2D, it would make it even better if you saw it in 3D. I saw it in 3D and I thought that they used 3D technology really well( especially when they were in Asgard). So my suggestion to you is to actually listen to the critics(78 percent have given Thor a good review on RottenTomatoes.com)and go to movies or buy the DVD when it comes out. I know that I will definetly add this to my movie collection in the near future."
2,Buying Used DVD's,"Decided to try to fill in my library of DVD's by ordering Used - Good and Used - Like New DVD's offered on Amazon.Received my copy of Thor Today - Used / Like New.The DVD Case had friction scratches on the front more than DVD's that i have owned for years, certainly not Like New.Other DVD's that I received classifed as Used / Good that were fulfilled by Amazon where shrink wrapped, with Product Labels applied to the shrink wrap. Thor was not shrink wrapped and had the product label stuck firmly on the exterior of the DVD Case.If DVD plays, I will keep it and replace the case, but if not I will return it.So Far, kind of disappointed :-(Thor"
1,Another movie!,"This movie is sold by Amazon.com LLC and is the third blu ray to come damaged, missing disc or broken packaging. You also cannot rate the seller and the return policy is a joke. Just a warning when ordering movies from here, the ""Thor"" movie was missing a disc."
2,Weak execution of story,Too much emphasis on action scenes and no real acting done for the actual story line. Saturday morning cartoons have done a better job.
2,great graphics but plot nonsensical soup,"Great graphics can't save a stinker plot which is tiresome and battles could be longer, less long winded talking that makes 0 sense."
1,Horrible and disappointing,"The actors really didn't seem to be trying. Natalie Portman was certainly miscast, not that she's that great to begin with. Norse mythology is far more interesting than this watered down rubbish.i was very, very bored watching this film.I wasted my money on this."
3,Fun But Not Worth Paying,"It was an OK movie, not as good as Iron Man I or II or as good as The Avengers (best movie in the series). It was a little cheesy and the story was very jumpy. Every other scene was a different world. It was easy to follow but didn't allow for much continuity. Anyhow, it was watching it on Prime for free from my couch. I would have been disappointed in the theater but good pick at home. \\"
2,Meh,"This isn't much of a movie, even as a popcorn flick it is only so-so. Natalie Portman is always nice to look at, and the visuals are OK, but this is the visual equivalent of a marshmallow. The fight scenes weren't engaging, and you just don't care about the characters."
2,Not terrible,"I never read the comic so I don't know if the twist as to who the Asgardians are is from the original or for the movie but, overall, the movie was o.k. It was a little goofy at times (even for a movie about a comic-book hero). I wouldn't buy this but, considering I rented it for $1, I can't really complain.Not recommended."
3,I've seen better,The beginning of the movie was great. But when he got to earth it got stupid. Like how did he fall in love with the girl and there was no leading them to it. They just did. The rest of the story was fine. I guess i WOULD REALLY GIVE IT A 3 1/2. But I couldnt watch this over and over again
2,meh,I could not rent this movie and had to buy it (right after Avengers of course). Unfortunately it was not offered in HD and a month later it's on Netflix instant in HD. Oh yeah the movie is just average.
4,Good movie for the marvel fans,"AS the title says, good movie for the marvel and everyone in between. I feel it fell short in some parts and trying to tell a bigger story in a limited timeframe made some parts rather rushed and left some questions lingering."
3,Got fooled by Branagh as director...,"With K. Branagh as director and co-starring Anthony Hopkins, I really believed this was worth the effort. Alas, it is 2 hours you'll never get back again. Natalie is pretty as always, but this is no Black Swan. The SFX are fine (a bit over the top), but unless you're a Marvel Comics fan, don't expect to hear an Academy Award screenplay or see top notch acting. Branagh should stick to Shakespeare..."
4,"Thor was a gift, so I bought it and mailed it on","It was a gift and was asked for, so I am assuming they liked it. I have heard nothing but good things about it."
4,"Perhaps a strange aspect to review, but...","I enjoyed this movie. Quite a bit. What got me, though, was the ending credits. Being a lifelong fan of scifi (trek, wars, b-films, adventure/suspense standalone films, etc) I'd long lamented how poor the average movie-maker's understanding of astrophysics has turned out to be. The most recent trek movie, for example, took every opportunity to fail at science they could (except with the quiet of space, I guess.) THOR, however... Thor nailed the proper structural visualizations for nebulae like no one ever has in my movie-fanatic experience. Perhaps it's a strange thing to notice, but I appreciated it nonetheless."
5,Marvel Studios is making magic,"This movie it's incredible good, it's the Marvel Comic's origin of the god of thunder THOR, I think this movie it's as good as Iron Man, it's the perfect beggining to and great comibook movie franchise, the cast it's perfect, and the view of Asgard it's awesome, great movie, great director, great cast, great story, what else do you want?"
5,"Great action and drama, good acting as well","Great Thor movie, good action, good story line, good drama, and characters were good as well. With plenty of action, and fights."
5,The best Movie by Marvel,"This movie is the clear example of how a movie should be. Thor is just amazing, great storyline, some funny scenes too. It is a must have."
3,Preview the book before giving it as a gift,"Nicely organized with sentimental and practical messages that most parents would like to convey. Because there are so many references to conservative Bible teachings, I've decided not to give the book as a gift."
3,so so,just a short cd. buy decksanddrumsandrockandroll. it has all the songs plus the cd that i just wrote about.its a waist of time and money buying this one...
3,A nice beginners piece,"I purchased this recorder mostly for the cleaning rod, but also for the look, which was rather more delicate then my first recorder. When it arrived I was semi dissapointed by the fact that it was darker and does appear like plastic, nothing like wood or ivory as I was half way expected. Nothing big, just an observation. Other then that, it does clog much easier then my original soprano Gill recorder and that is frustrating. On the upside, it is easy to clean, the fingering is very easy to find, it's ""voice"" is more mellow then my original and makes it easier on my family to listen to when I am learning high parts to songs. Definately worth $5 when you include shipping and the joint grease was a nice addition for anyone who has never dealt with that before! Eventually though, a Novice to Advanced player will wish to buy a better recorder to work on and play with. For the beginner though, it's an extreamly nice buy!"
4,Not BAD at all!!!,I just finished my workout and I give it two thumbs up! The instructor was not as bad as the reviews and she really worked your butt! I recommend it to add to your workout DVDS when you need something a little bit different.
2,Has the potential BUT...,"and that is a really BIG but...I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of the workout!! The instructor was not motivating at ALL; in fact she's incredibly monotone and I swear if I hear the words, ""Thaaaaaat's it!"" one more time I may scream!! After 10 minutes I wanted to put my fist through the TV...even my boyfriend noticed how often she said those words. There were times when she didn't speak at all and didn't educate about the importance of form once! I've tried many workout dvds and I can usually get through them even if the instructor is mediocre but this one just got on my last nerve!"
2,Not as good as Shape Bikini Body Boot Camp,"The actual workouts were challenging with lots of interesting variations on classic moves. I am sure they would be effective over time, if I could only get past the masculine and annoying instructor. The instructor is Dominique Hall - if you were expecting the trifecta of excellence (Lisa Wheeler, Tracy York and Michelle Dozois) you will be very disappointed. Hall's background is in bodybuilding. Her voice is so masculine and her body is ""jacked"" - I am not talking Justice in the Hip Hop Abs series jacked, more like the abs of a male model in Men's Health. She tries to motivate you, but does so by only saying ""that's it"" repeatedly. For the entire time I am doing the DVD all I can think is, ""for the love of god, I hope I do not look like her when I am done."" The workouts are not as effective, and pale in comparison to the Shape Bikini Body Boot Camp Transforming and Redefining DVDs. If you want a Shape workout, go with one of those because they are amazing."
3,A light work out,Its just an ok work out. I like more intense work outs and its a little slow but if you are just begining a workout routine habit this would be a good place to start.
5,Very useful,"I've had these for some time now, and use them very often. For all those ""stinky"" left-overs you don't want to stick in a plastic top-aware, which you'll have to throw out after - these metal bowls do the trick. Fish, meats, and all other items - they'll store. Easy to clean and reuse. The design is very cute too. Love, Love, Love them! I only wish they had more size varieties. Taller, wider, square, etc...."
2,Very disjointed writing style--my attention span wavered,"I am a huge Andy Kaufman fan, and although I am learning facts about him here that I never knew before, this is an extremely annoying book to read. I believe the author tries to ""talk"" and ""think"" like Andy; yet, it comes across as juvenile, intelligence-insulting, and very hard to follow. I think he tries too hard to NOT follow a general writing style, but he fails. While I appreciate the facts contained in this book, it's rough wading through all the other junk to get to them."
4,Lost in the Funouse,"This was an entertaining bio of Andy Kaufman although I think some of what made it into this book is probably a figment of the authors imagination because I don't think even those who were closest to Kaufman really knew what was going on inside his head. Fun to read, great stuff about Kaufmans legendary bizarre work, life and habits. Kaufman was a true original."
2,A major letdown,"This is a major letdown -- I generally like Zehme's writing, but boy did he blow it here. So overwritten and not terribly illuminating."
5,Wonderful gift,"My friend was thrilled to receive this set as a baby gift. I felt a little silly for investing in them after learning that Target sells cheaper BabyLegs, but my friend with the baby says she much prefers the original. The BabyLegs were adorable on her new daughter. I'll update this review if the BabyLegs are less of a success as the baby grows older."
4,Helpful workbook,"Wipe Clean Activity Work Book (Wipe Clean Activity Books)A wide range of activities including dot to dot, letter, number and shape tracing, counting trucks, animals or bugs, Mazes, writing words, word search, upper and lower case letters. Use over and over. What could be better?"
2,Not worth it.,This book was a waste of money and time reading it. the photoshop tutorials I can get from websites free.
4,"Didn't like at first, but It kind of Grows on you!","I must admit, as a fan for years and owner of every King's X CD, I did not like this offering at first. However with repeated listening, this CD does indeed grow on you. The production quality alone is just amazing. There are many different styles of music represented as well.My personal favorites are the pleasant sounding Dreams, (of which a live video is included as an extra), the classic radio ready Finished, the epic Johnny, the GBV with a budget sounding Working Man, and the rocking title track. The track Screamer is my favorite as it is a rather creepy tune complete with actual screaming raising the rating from a 3 to a 4 in my book. Yes, I could do without Rock Pile, but even that one had a lethal guitar solo in it.So give Black Like Sunday a try, but when listening try to forget all previous King's X CD's. You'll appreciate this one better that way."
1,What happened???,"Two mysteries here: 1) why would this great band release such a motley collection of old riffs masquerading as a new album, and 2) why would anybody rave about it as they are here?? I had only to ""sample"" a few songs online before deciding I not only wouldn't buy this album, I wouldn't even care to download it for free! This formerly excellent band (who I have been a huge fan of since Day One) has been inexplicably avoiding writing a great album for 10 years now. Why they can't sit down and put together another ""Gretchen goes to Nebraska"", with its brilliant production, melodies and compositional grandeur is beyond me. Instead, of late, they've been releasing half-assed heavy-metal junk that pales in comparison to any of their first four, great, albums. Even Ty's latest solo album was better than most of King's X recent output. But this one is inexcusable!!"
3,great tea bad shipper,its green tea not much to say about it the tea it self is outstanding very good quality great taste and freshness.The only con i could tell u is when this did finally show up i had forgotten that i had ordered it that is how long it took to reach me but i would buy it again which i just might as i start to run lower on what i have left that way when i do finally run out i should all ready have the new one in hand
2,Expositors Bible Commentary Vol. 7 Daniel and Minor Prophets,"I was missing this volume from my library set. I had hoped it would have a dust jacket since all of the volumes in my set have them. Unfortunately, it didn't. It would have been nice to have had this information in advance of purchase as there were many copies available and I could have bought the one I really needed. Please consider having this kind of information included in your postings of available used books.Dr. Randall PriceExecutive DirectorCenter for Judaic StudiesLiberty UniversityThe Expositor's Bible Commentary, Volume 7 Only with the New International Version by Frank E. Gaebelein"
4,Perfect for my 8 gallon,Perfect size for a smaller tank. Super easy to use and should last a lifetime.
4,One of their best,"MAN, this is the album that ""Shameless"" should have been! It is one of their three truely brilliant albums - others being ""Troublegum"" and ""S.P.Y.F."". ""High Anxiety"" combines the metallic sound of ""Troublegum"" with the no-holds-barred attitude of ""SPYF"" and adds some multi-layered melody of ""Semi-Detached"". Yet, it sounds truely original. A must have for any rock fan."
4,Great Company!,"Bought a lightbulb for my lamp and it came within days of me buying the item. Unfortunaly the lightbulb was damaged in transit to my house. As soon as I told them I my story, I was received a new bulb again within days, free of charge! The new bulb works great and was what I was looking for."
5,A good butterfly light bulb,This bulb was easy to install and the few months we used it at our vacation place it worked fine. If needed I would order another.
1,If one would ever work...,I have now ordered three of these light bulbs because they keep arriving broken! The first two rattled as soon as I took them out of the box but I'm hoping the third time will be the charm. How frustrating! I'm not sure if they are just defective bulbs or if it's poor packaging. I'll update the review IF I ever receive one that works...**Updated**--I received the new bulb today and guess what?! It rattled too and wouldn't work. So of course I'm returning it and am giving up. It will be cheaper (and less frustrating) to just buy a new lamp. :-/
1,"Arrived BROKEN, Twice!","The WORST! Because it arrived BROKEN!I purchased a second buld from a different Amazon vendor -- It also arrived broken. Identical, totally inadequate Amazon packaging from both vendors. And then there is the time-consuming hassle of the returns.One would assume that with so much previous feedback about these bulbs arriving broken, multiple times to the same customer, that Amazon would have corrected the problem. Bad assumption on my part!Save yourself time and trouble - go buy the higher-priced bulb from your local hardware store. You'll pay more, but it will cost you a lot less.Do NOT buy until Amazon says they have addressed the problem."
3,For Diehard Fans Only,"This is not a greatest hits collection. There are some signature songs, such as Cleveland Rocks and Once Bitten Twice Shy, but most of the songs are rarities and single edits. Casual fans may be shocked to hear edited or alternate versions of their favorite songs (see prior reveiws). Many more will be disappointed for the lack of perennial favorites. HOWEVER - this is an excellent collection for Ian's cult followers, the ones who love alternate versions, demos, and edits. You will get a glimpse of Ian's genius in this set, but you won't find those songs you remember hearing ""way back then."""
2,"Complicated moves, not well shown or explained","This is a somewhat cardio intense workout with a lot of emphasis on lower body toning. Lisa Wheeler does not do a good job of explaining what she is doing and the few things she does explain the camera actually cuts away so you can't see it. It took a long time to get a hang of the complicated moves (if I had a dance background maybe it would have been easier, but most of us don't). It's like the director and Lisa worked together to make this video hard to use."
3,like 12 min workouts in it,Not one of my favorites but it can do once in a while. Cardio can be interesting for someone who likes dancing like that...I don't when I workout. Steps sometimes hard to follow but nothing like those FIRM dvds! Really really like 12 min workouts in this one. Especially the ballet one.
1,these did nothing for my jeep,these so called lift leaf springs put absolutely no lift on my cherokee if there not the same as the stock ones they're worse dont buy these they are a rip off!
5,Very catchy,"I heard Bleu's ""I Won't Go Hollywood"" on the XBox game Project Gotham Racing a while back and instantly loved it, even though I'm more into harder music, mostly industrial and hard rock. But, somehow, Bleu got my attention and I love every song on this CD. It's so catchy and, at times, upbeat. Makes for some pretty good roadtrip music!"
5,Bleu = Phat,Any fan of power pop needs to purchase this cd. Bleu is the Cheap Trick/Knack of the new millenium. Every song on this thing is great. I got it used on here for about $1.75...total bargain! I haven't stopped listening to it since.
3,Okay but not great,I found this book to be okay the pictures are great quality but to little text in the book and to many pics. But again the pics are good.
3,Not Bad,"XXX: 30 Porn-Star Portraits . This book is hard rate is't part pictoral part document it.s hard to get into it. The bios are certianly good but invidual commentary lacks entertainment because if you dont look at the adult flim industry as human beings. In doing what the like to do, it will be boring to alot of people but if like objectivity you will find it stimulating and you'll understand it.."
5,wii s-video cable,"This cable really made a differance on my 52"" 1080p tv. The colors are so much better. If you have a 1080p tv this cable is a must for your WII."
5,Not a game - a cable,This cable allows us to play Beatles Rock Band on my sons Wii at my place when he brings it. Lotsa fun.
4,Excellent Book,"I recently purchased this book in tandem with ""Building the Greenland Kayak"". What a beautiful and informative book. The pictures are clearly reproduced and the text is clear and informative. Anybody interested in the subject of traditional skin-on-frame kayaks will find this book a useful addition to their library."
4,Excellent Perspective,"Whether you agree or disagree with Kagan, I believe this is an interesting look at the relationship between the United States and Europe. It also is interesting how Kagan looks at history to try to tell the future. This should be a must read for any pol-sci student."
5,Kagan's insight and analysis is right on the mark!,"The book ""Of Paradise and Power"" by Robert Kagan is a short, concise, well-written book that offers a scholarly analysis of the current relationship between the United States and Europe. . .Written this past summer as an essay and later published in book form, it it right-on-target with today's lack of US/European consensus in the United Nations. . . In little over 100 pages, Robert Kagan offers us an explanation of the post-Cold War policies and examines the relationships, political/military actions, and national interests that have brought us to where we are today. . . This is a ""must read"" for anyone trying to make sense of what's happening in the UN Security Council today. . ."
2,alluring concept - though it misses the mark,"Alluring little book which I read in one sitting. Though the author's overemphasis on wielding force misses the point - our greatest current challenge is terrorism, and the war against terrorism cannot be won by military means alone. Police work, cooperation with other nations (ironically Europeans have had much more experience than the US in fighting terrorism and ensuring security at home), and the encouragement of economic and political development are essential.In this, as in most matters, the reality is that the US can lead, but it cannot dominate. Leadership implies strength but also some humility. ""Speak softly and carry a big stick"", as Theodore Roosevelt used to say."
5,best exercise machine for small apartments,this little exerciser is great. It is very portable and easy to use. I have it in my home office and use it every day.
5,Awesome daily moisturizer,"I used to use a dept store moisturizer, but was feeling that it just sat on top of my skin and wasn't really doing the job. I had a facial at a spa and they used the Borlind skin care line on me. It felt so wonderful that I decided to purchase it on line (I am not aware of any local stores that carry it). That was 5 years ago and I still love it. I have had facials since and had comments about what wonderful condition my skin is in. I am 45, so that is very nice to hear. This product really moisturized without leaving any greasy feeling. I have had excema since I was a baby, so i have very sensitive skin, and this product does not cause any issues. I definitely reccomend."
2,Just who is this ?,This is advertising a pewter statue of Legoas but the image shown is of Aragorn ! Do these people not check what they write ? They mention bows and arrows when the image has another character wielding a sword. I can't imagine anyone will pay the asking price of almost $ 500 with so much confusion.
1,Sorry I bought,"I actually ordered Books I, II and III. I guess I did not check very well> Not sure what I expected but these certainly not it. I have read part of Book I and do not intend to continue."
2,"If you hang alot of board, don't get this one.","I bought this lift since it was about half the price of the telpro brand, and looks about the same. I should have waited and spent the extra money for the telpro. My dad has a telpro that we still use everyday, he's had it for at least 15 years now, this one I bought, didn't even last one garage ceiling before something broke on it. We've fixed and welded about everything on it, and it works good now, but every week, had to weld something here and there just to be able to keep using it. Save your money, and put it towards the telpro panel lift, you won't be disapointed w/ that one."
3,Not bad...a little pricey for quality.,"I purchased this fo-floor as a photography prop. Easy to store, and easy to clean... a think a little pricey for quality and size. I really need 2 of them for full coverage in my studio, but I am not spending another $100 for a novelty item."
2,Network Security?,"I purchased a copy of this book for a network security class. In a way it has been a great read, for humor. The terms and programs are dated at best, made up at worst. An example, 'drive-by hacking,'I have NEVER seen this anywhere. It is commonly refered to as 'war driving,' showing its lineage to 'war dialing' or 'Snooping'. I have worked in IT security for the past 3 years and I find this book insulting. But, for a plus, it is a convenent size to use as a clip board, and it does hold papers down on my desk well."
4,Good fix for Airplane fans.,"This DVD is a great fix for die hard Airplane fans. While some of the music appears to be dubbed in from original recordings, it contains some rare footage from some great performances. Some of the video is not of the highest quality, but is what might be expected from the technology available during this era. The DVD also gives some good historical and personal perspectives from the band members.If you are a hard core Airplane fan, you have to own this DVD. You won't be disappointed."
5,Olivia Rules,"A wonderful album, so rich that it deserves to be a top seller. Hearing Olivia in such a variety of songs is a joy, the album has a rare unity despite the different styles and partners. There are some knock out tunes, the best the song with Darren Hayes from Savage Garden : that IS adult pop, elegant, sexy without all the high drama and over production that is the common thing in these so arid years. The song with Tina Arena is a winner, please DJ 's, play the song it must be a # 1 . The rest is fantastic and the bonus track, Physical, is a classic reworking of a song, sooooo sexy. A great song is the rocker Sunburned Country with Keith Urban, a potential # 1 in country chartsOlivia is a legend, she deserves to be treated with more respect and this album proves that the voice IS the personality, not the ""volume"" of it., as sometimes some think.Pop lives, long live the queen!!!(...)"
3,Well ...,"This is definately not Olivia's best album, but it is not the worst. Her voice is not at it vocal height, but it is still and album that I would not exclude. My favorite duet on here is the one with Keith Urban, ""Sunburned Country."""
5,Excellent all-purpose skillet,"I bought this pan after reading a review in the NY Times. I am very satisfied with it. Unlike others, I haven't had problems with uneven heating. I've found that it retains heat extremely well and that it is essentially non-stick if I use lower heat settings (even with minimal oil). I stuck it in the oven to roast beets which worked well. It's heavy but that's a minor negative. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
3,good,i got this book under used section n it was mentioned its new.the password comes with this book which we hav to scrap but i did not get anything in there.but overall i would say this book is good.
1,TERRIBLE experience,"The box arrived to my house empty. Apparently, it opened at some point during the transit. The seller did not seal it well enough and did not respond to my messages and the post office wasn't very helpful either. HORRIBLE experience and waste of a lot of much needed money."
3,Western medicine and its discontents,"As some others have said, this is slow reading. My main point, though, is that the author seems to think that Western medicine is hardly more valid than any of the other alternatives, and his conclusion is that while it has had some successes the result may be that we are about back where we started, with new ailments replacing the old. The author does not seem to see this as simply an understandable consequence of success. Maybe we would be better off just going back to the 19th century (or before)?"
2,very disappointed,"My daughter and I just opened Dora, with her puppy and Backpack. Doras head is scratched very badly, and she barely stands on her own, put Backpack on her and forget it. I love Fisher Price toys, but I'm afraid to open the other two packages that I bought. My daughter is crying out of frustration right now. I wish we had chosen a different toy."
4,It's Okay,"This microwave works great. The only problem is the popcorn button, you have to press it multiple times according to the weight of the bag. The problem I have is if I press it twice, many unpopped kernels remain in the bag. If I press the button three times the popcorn will burn. So I have to keep an eye and ear on the popcorn when I make it."
1,Listen...,"You cannot put a whitney houston cover with a Pink Floyd cover .....period... it is not right chico...""it don't mix"" if you can understand my english. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico... so I know about the underground. I love wyclef and I understand what the kid is trying to do, but it does not work. Your No woman no cry cover is really chill. but don't press your luck my friend.... whish you were here just does not sound right."
4,Not quite invisible,"A very good product. Sounds great, easy installation. The grill is not as white as I had hoped so it definitely is pronounced on the white ceiling."
5,Inspiring new rules for parents to live by,"Parents often fall back upon ineffective rules in raising their children. Gay Moore, who is an experienced nurse, counselor, and educator, offers new rules for parenting in this insightful and inspiring book. Written in a day-by-day format, the book encourages parents to reject outdated and ineffective rules. In their stead, Moore offers new rules that embody more effective parenting. Moore looks at such issues as fostering self-esteem, overcoming perfectionism, and dealing effectively with all family members. Dividing the material into daily readings makes the task of trying new parenting techniques more manageable. Both practical and inspiring, this book will help parents with children of all ages."
2,Not as effective as Synovi G3 Soft Chews,"We have a 12 year old Ridgeback with hip displasia. We were on Synovi G3's for years and our dog was doing great without any mobility problems.We switched to this product (Joint Max) via a coupon that came with the Synovi G3 brand and it's been all downhill from there. We're only halfway through the 240 count Joint Max, and our dog can barely get up.Your mileage my vary, but for us, the G3 brand was much more effective. We're switching back to it immediately."
3,Not sure if it works or not,"I have 2 labs - 7 yr and 5 yr. As a long time owner of labs, I know the signs, symptoms and expensive long term treatment of mobility problems in large breeds. As a preventative supplement I started both labs about a year ago on this product. I have to say, I have not seen any noticeable improvement nor have a I seen any side efforts....so not sure if this product really works or not! My dogs are healthy and active and they were healthy and active before I started using this product.I can say - my dogs love the Soft Chews - they think they are treats! And I have used them as a pill pocket to give other medicines."
3,Joint Max Soft Chews: Don't like new texture,"The new texture I don't like to crumbly. My dog seems to not want to chew these but just swallow--the ""older"" chews she at least chewed a couple of times before they disappeared. For some reasonnot sure if they are working as well....will keep an eye on it"
4,Joint Max chews,"The dogs love it. I give the larger dogs (90 lbs) one 3 times a day; the small dog (45 lbs0 only 2 p/day & she sulks. At first I thought that my tender stomached Collie was having difficulty, but his poop got better, so it might have been something else. One month isn't enough to really judge, so I'll buy another batch. Can't hurt as treats."
5,Awesome Book!,An insightful and a strong read! A book for guys who want to knowmore about themselves!!!!!
4,Men sharing,It is good that men should dwell together. Men should share their experiences with eachother.
5,This album gets better every time I play it.,"I admit, I'm totally adicted to Nanci Griffith's work. I have every one of her albums. But this is my favorite. Her songs often tell interesting stories but these are some of her best. They also give her an unusually good opportunity to show off her wonderfully melodic voice. Several of the cuts, ""Across the Great Divide,"" ""Tecumseh Valley,"" ""Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"" and ""Do Re Mi"" are positively infectious: you listen a few times and you =have= to sing along with her; it helps, of course, that I have a stereo in my bathroom and can play this album while I shower in the morning! :)"
5,Nanci fans unite!,This is a stellar album by a stellar artist. The variety that she includes on this album in phenominal. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys folk music or any of Nanci's other CDs.
2,Poorly Constructed Table,"This is one of the worst flat pack pieces I have seen in a long time.Problems I encountered:**I had to re-glue some of it back together**some of the wood is split (fortunately in less obvious places)**some holes had to be redrilled**unsanded rough edges**paint is chipped off on some edges and worn off from rubbing during shipping on top and front (ordered white)**almost all of the screw heads are visible after assembly even though they are recessed so plug covers could have been included easily**the lovely letter stickers that show which piece is which are at the top still seen when done and are on stickers that are hard to remove without leaving marksIf I wasn't 10 days from my due date with a toddler running around, I would take it all apart, sand it, rebuild it, and repaint it. I am interested to see how long it lasts."
3,"An okay book, but I'd recommend others!","Gosh, I was a little disappointed with this book. I spent most of the time writing corrections in the margins of the ""history"" chapter, and got a little bored with the rest. It isn't an awful book by any means having a nice hodge-podge of spells, recipes, and lore, but I found even the more authentic sections to be uninspired. Printed in a fairly small-sized book, the lay-out is cluttered and hard to read. When I got my hands on ""Halloween"" by Silver Ravenwolf, I said ""Oh, THIS is the book I was looking for."" Sorry Gerina."
2,Disappointed,"If you get this, do so for the sculpting segment, the cardio is ""punch, punch,hit, hit, 1-2-3, jab, jab, upper cut, jab, jab..."" Redundant, unimaginative, completely boring! The sculpting parts are good but taken from his TV show so ""do the other side during the commercial break"" just gets left out. Yes, you could stop the tape and do it, but if you're going to sell it as a separate video and are editing it anyway--why not pan out to the surf or other and have a voice over count it out?! Simple to do and would make a much more professional product. I've always been a Gilad fan so am disappointed when he's not as good as he could be."
3,EZ Use,"This little attachment is fantastic. Plug it in and load the software, you're done. As long as you have an open sky with no dense cover, it'll take a minute and you're on your way. I'd rate the GPS CF card 5 stars.Only reason I gave this 3 stars and not 5 is the software it comes with is very primative. On the PDA it's fine and simple enough to use, but I don't like the user interface with the map software on the PC. In order to use the maps on the iPAQ you have to sync it from the 2-bit graphic interface software on the desk top. If you plan on using the software for cross country road trips, think again. the map software only alows you to plan regional trips within small areas, and you can only plot points from your PDA not your PC. 2 Stars for the software."
1,Lousy Handspring (PalmOne) service,"My Treo failed twice and each time I had to pay $25 to get a replacment shipped and an additional $20 to speak with a technical service representative. Thus, an additional $70 due to a defetive product (and the second unit was different from the first)!Beware - use another manufacturer."
3,"lucas,ray",I was very impressed with 1) phone 2)internet 3)messages (sms)however I was very disappointed with 1)very poor resolution of 160x160...I had difficulty to read words...I do use my PDA more then my phone...2)poor camerawhy paying $500 for a PDA that got a resolution of 160x160 like my old Visor !!!I better wait for next generation of Treo (palm version 6/better resolution)
2,Bad voice function,"Otherwise a great phone, but the problem is that the voice function is below standards. Very silent voice with a lot of noise."
1,Very Poor Signal Strength,"The Treo 650 I bought is ALWAYS two to three bars below other phones (at the same location) in signal strength. Sprint has been totally unhelpful in this regard saying they can find nothing wrong with the unit.I would reccommend against the Treo 650 unless one is sure, very sure, they will never be in any but the strongest signal areas.Sprint support has been a joke, except that I am not laughing."
4,Pretty good little device,"I've had my Treo 600 over a year now, and haven't had any trouble, except for a couple lock-ups that cleared away easily w/ a soft reset. I just installed a 1 meg SD card and Real-player's MP3 player (free!) on the phone and the sound quality (w/ Sony earbuds) is much better than I expected. The 650 wasn't available when I bought mine--I assume I'd buy a 650 if I were shopping today. OBTW, I'm on Sprint and it works well, BUT!! You can't (currently) take Sprint phones over to Europe (GSM, CDMA, whatever...), so if you travel much, think about that before you go w/ a certain provider.I give my Treo an A- overall (bit big & heavy, but it would be hard for it not to be, if you want a keypad and nice screen)."
1,Caution,"I own a Handspring Platinum Visor and a Treo 180. With the Platinum, they dropped the price after I purchased (fine, typical policy). After I bought the Treo, they discontinued the product (again, these things happen). My Treo broke exactly one year after I purchased it. When I tried to return it for repair, the customer service people told me I would need to call the service number and get charged another [$] before I could even get a Return number! This is after several phone calls and email dialogs where they wanted me to go through various steps to isolate the problem (which I happily complied with).I won't go into the lousy service, that could be the carrier. If you are still convinced you want one of these, make sure you keep the packing material - I threw mine out and after a painful 6 months I finally recieved the rebate I was entitled to.I will never buy another device from this company. Great marketing hype but read the fine print carefully!"
3,all the power of an old Windows PC...,"... with all of the reliability too. The Treo 600 sometimes freezes when you want to make or receive a call. Mine also spent one day pretending to work but it wasn't accepting incoming calls and trying to dial out resulted in a ""network error"". A friend with the wireless provider standing in the same spot was able to make calls.If you wear sunscreen and hold this phone up to the side of your face you'll find that the screen gets smeared with goop, unlike with a flip phone design."
3,Terrible speaker problems-- BEWARE,"I loved my treo for about 5 days. Then the speaker just went out-- I caould hear nothing without my headset. then a huge buzz developed in the headset. I had to wait 12 days for a replacement which came out of the box doing the exact same thing. After about three hours on the phone with various customer service folks, a THIRD treo was sent to me, and guess what? After two days I have no speaker and a huge buzz. What kind of phone is that?On the pkus side, my email function works great, but I need the phone. I am in the process of waiting for a ""senior executive"" to call me, but haven't heard a word in 48 hours. I am not a happy camper. Do I dare to try a fourth unit???"
4,Had the Samsung I 500 and traded in for Treo 600,"I had the Samsung I500 for a week and exchanged it for the Treo 600 and I like it so much more. It is much easier to use and more advanced. The sound is better, web capabilities are better. Even though its alittle bit longer than the samsung it doesnt weigh anymore.Keyboard does take alittle getting used to but it was easier to learn than I thought it was. I exchanged my samsung for the treo thinking that I would exchange back to the samsung if I didnt like the treo but after 2 hours I knew that i was going to keep the Treo.I havent had any problems with the speaker or the screen or the display. But I do have the replacement plan if there are any problems. And there are several stores in my area to take it back to if there are any problems."
1,awful,"I would consider myself the type of anime fan who easily likes anime, but this is the first anime movie I've ever been disappointed with. Here we have a cool swordsman who just stands there, a mage who never gets a chance to cast any spells, and a little girl who's tossed in for no apparent reason. There's virtually no character development. The movie focuses too much on the mysterious city these travelers enter. It was ok to watch for the first time, but there's zero re-watch value. I was so disappointed that I sold this DVD on eBay after viewing, and I had a difficult time doing so since it seemed no one wanted it. If you still insist on viewing this movie - RENT IT."
5,Celebrating our mothers kitchens: treasured memories and tested recipes,I received this book and it is wonderful. The condition is like new and the recipes are great. Thanks for offering such an excellent book at such an excellent price--keep up the good work!
2,An insult to Ben Webster,"This disk is a compilation of select cuts from three other CDs: ""Webster Meets Peterson"" (6 of 7), ""The Tatum Group Masterpieces"" (4 of 10) and ""Ben And Sweets"" (2 of 6). Compilations sometimes are desirable, but not this one. This is one of the worst mastering jobs I have ever heard. The sound is thin and the eq curve is screwed up. The Peterson cuts (the original sounds great) has those problems plus the channels are reversed. On the Tatum cuts a stereoizer is added. The result is just dopey.Hey Mr. Mastering Engineer - if you don't know how to master..... don't.Do yourself a favor and get the originals and skip this crap."
3,"Amusing, but Starts To Wear Thin","Ron Hansen's Isn't It Romantic? is a mostly amusing little romp--a romantic tale about a misplaced French couple somewhere in the middle of Nebraska. Natalie and Pierre are engaged, but Natalie, tiring of Pierre's cheating behavior decides to take a cross-country tour of the USA, a country she has always been fascinated with. Pierre manages to track her down in Nebraska. For some reason, after their bus breaks down, Pierre and Natalie decide to stay in Seldom, Nebraska, a town full of ""wacky"" (and misunderstood) characters. What was at first very amusing and funny begins to wear thin as Hansen develops his characters and they start behaving straight out of your standard contemporary romance novel. The whole wonderful toungue-in-cheekiness of the novel starts to vanish and we are left with something more tiring."
1,NCIS season 5,"In Season 5, disk 1 was not able to be viewed due to pixilations and dropouts. The other disks were fuzzy and of poor quality. We returned the set to Tons-of-Stuff in Medford Wisconsin and got a refund. Since then we have purchased the same season from another seller and found it to be excellent. The NCIS series is exciting and adventurous and one of our very favorite programs."
3,Didn't help me stay alert like I expected,"I guess I was expecting an effect much like 5 hour energy, but I found myself needing more and more in order to stay alert. The taste however is great!"
1,Not impressed.,Doesn't keep water cold for as long as I'd hoped...but my biggest complaint is that it's hard to drink from--I don't like having to suck on the little nozzle. You get as much air as water.
1,Bought 2 and BOTH BROKE! See images.,"I dropped mine and a crack appeared near the bottom and the bottle leaked from then on - useless now. I also dropped my second one and the same thing happened. Yes, I dropped them -- but should they really break? I own 3 other stainless steel bottles from the same company - the little 12 oz. and two 40 oz. bottles. I've dropped all of them - especially the 40 ozers while totally full and they didn't break. Sure, they're dented like crazy from multiple drops, but they're still intact and I love them (see images). They don't have those ridges, and I wonder if that causes some sort of weakness. I wish I hadn't bought this 1-liter bottle. I like this size, so tonight I'm buying the Klean Kanteen 27 ozer. Perhaps I'll write a review of that one after I've had it for awhile."
2,This bottle is very large,"This is a nice water bottle, but it is just too large to be practical to use in the car and take with you."
5,Wife happy with Ghost Whisperer,"I order this movie for Christmas for my wife. She is a big fan. Movie arrived quickly, I am happy, 5 stars."
4,Great buy for the price,The product was just as the buyer's description implied. It was in great shape and I was glad that it was available at this price.
5,"No need to categorize this music: it's extremely original art, pure and simple.","The various tracks that adorn this disk comprise a heart felt story from start to finish. If you appreciate artistic expression for the originality it can express, then there is absolutely no need to compare this to Boards of Canada, Willy Nelson, or J.S. Bach. This is high art."
3,Away too much info,This may be a great for an historical document but away too wordy for an easy read. I skipped a LOT just to get to the real meat of the story. I wouldn 't recommend it.
5,Nothing beats Le Creuset,"I originally wanted to buy the Le Creuset stoneware pie dish for $30, I decided against it and bought this one because I thought it would be sturdier and last longer and I love the handles. I have no regrets. My first quiche came out great, no uneven baking. I would recommend Le Creuset over and over and over. Expensive compared to other brands but definitely worth it."
1,"Avoid 2007, Stay w/ 2006",I wished I had read all of the reviews before I upgraded to the 2007 version of PC -Cillin. I pretty much had the same problems as everyone else. The memory maxed out when '07 was running in the background and my IE and Outlook Express would not function with the upgrade. I uninstalled '07 and reinstalled '06 and still had problems. IE and Outlook Express would still not run even with '06 reinstalled. I spent over a week on the phone w/ tech support (over 12 hours) and they could still not solve the problem. The only way my system would function properly was to totally uninstall PC-Cillin. My last ditch effort was to restore (I'm running XP Home) my system to a date before I did the '07 upgrade and then reinstall '06. This seemed to have corrected my issues for the time being. The '07 upgrade was a nightmare for my pc and hopefully I have my system straightened out now. Never again will I upgrade or install another software program w/o researching the reviews first.
2,"Memory hog, confusing user interface, awful tech support","This product consumes 150MB of RAM, which seems excessive.The user interface is confusing. Dialogs are popped up for various operations at random times and cannot be shut off.Tech support is by email. It takes two days to get a response, which is invariably unresponsive, completely different than the previous response, and appears to be written by a moron. After three months I have yet to get a sensible response to my question about how to reduce memory footprint.In the 2007 version, they also changed how the 3-user license works. Previously, each license lasted one year from the date it was installed. Now all three licenses expire one year after the first of the three is installed!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM PC CILLIN INTERNET SECURITY 2007,"As a user of PC Cillin for 2 years I was more than willing to sign up for a 3rd year. As a customer I was invited by Trend Micro to try the 2007 version. I figured no big deal since I would be renewing anyway. BIG mistake. It slowed my computer to a crawl, (and I already had issues with its CPU usage even before this release),and would not allow me to change the settings to my liking. The only positive thing is that I was able to uninstall 2007 and reinstall 2006. Oh, I forgot, in the past I was able to renew my subscription for $[...] and now they have the nerve to charge $[...] for this utter piece of crap. I originally purchased this software (2005, 2006) based on a PC Magazine review. I hope the will revisit Trend Micro and slam this version. Shame on a previously reputable company to put out such a horrible product."
1,Too big and too slow,"TrendMicro has been a trusted name for me until the 2007 version. It is way, way too big. Just forget running it on a 128MB or even a 256MB computer. But even on a dual-core system with 1GB or RAM is is really slows down your system."
1,NJF,"1.This locked up my computer.2.It changed my browser settings on it's own.3.Removed all my System Restore points (Win XP).4.Win XP would not start without going to a black screen and using the option ""Start Windows using last known good configuration"".5.Would not uninstall without my doing it manually and going into the Registry to remove it - permanently.**** I rate this as a waste of money."
2,Worse than Norton,"I puchased PC-Cillin to rid my machines from problems I was having with Norton, but I find that PC-Cillin is no better, and in some ways is worse. I am reluctantly going back to Norton."
5,"""In My Opinon""","I have used this anti-virus since 2000, I liked it then, and I love it now.If your the type of user that does not want to worry about your computer on the internet, this is for you.It can be a pain on older computers that have less RAM, but it still gets the job done.Now the cons, I had 3 experiences with customer service, and 2 were postitive, and 1 was negative. I'm not throwing the baby out with the bath water, although I wanted too.The woman was extremely rude, to the point that I contacted the corporate office.In the end I did renew my subscription.I had no idea how easy it is for exe programs, and the such to change settings on your computer allowing attacks. This software lets you know when your settings have changed as soon as they get changed.For 20.00 how can you go wrong!"
2,Missing Files and unorganized tech support...,"Our company purchased PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007 since Norton's 2007 version of there software is not compatible with Windows 2000 (hey, we're a non-profit organization.) When we installed the program on our windows 2000 computer, we realized something was missing. The Anti-Spam feature was non-existent! No toolbar, no filter. It took 2 weeks (including weekends!) for TrendMicro to come up with a solution. It turns out that there CDs were missing a few files.....And the poster who said that the shortest wait time was 45 minutes was not kidding.... There tech support asigned us a ""case number"" but nobody made any notes in our file, so every time we called we had to explain the issue, tell them what was missing, have them go through 20 different steps, which we had tried 20 different times, to end up with nothing. Once you get the program running, with all the components installed, it seeems ok."
1,Same problems as Norton,"A long time ago, Norton had a great antivirus program. Then they added so many bells and whistles that the program became huge and unbearably buggy. Then Trendmicro became the best with an easily installed and relatively simple, but effective, program. Now with the 2007 version Trendmicro has done exactly what Norton did, they have made the program so large (it's almost impossible to download it without a high speed connection) that they have joined Norton antivirus in the ranks of large unwieldy software. This program is difficult to install correctly and appears to be the cause of many new freeze ups. Many new little bugs have appeared but Trendmicro customer service is virtually nonexistent so it's hard to tell exactly what is going on. I don't know what I'm going to try next but this is the end for Trendmicro."
2,Handy but poor voice quality,"Got this at the (non-Amazon) Sprint store to replace my pre-historic Sony-Qualcomm CM-600 ""dogbone"" which was falling apart. The Nokia has a bright screen and easy-to-read large fonts -- unlike almost every other phone available from Sprint -- that make it usable for the older/visually impaired user. The phone is small and light, and while features require a number of different button and nav selections, it's no worse than most. However, the voice quality, per the Consumer Reports eval, is below par. I frequently have to use it with a earpiece/headset combo to be understood."
3,New to the phone,"I just want to say everything is cool with it, but I wanted to be able to download new games and ringtones is that possible with this phone? What website is there it has this model to download it to your phone? But overall great reception and very colorful and nice."
3,"This book is well written, but content is lacking","I purchased the book on the premise that it was written based on actual stories that had been fictionalized. Which apparently means something different to me, than to the author. The problem is, some of the stories just seem like creative short stories. Either way, while the writing is fine, the content just isn't my favorite."
5,Best filler out there,"Having a car with rusted out panels, I needed a good filler to complete my job.Evercoat gives you plenty of time to set the filler before it hardens.It is easy to sand, and remains rock hard."
4,"Works fine, stop complaining and just learn to use it/how it works.","Quite simple, ignore the drama reviews... lolI've had mine for 4 yrs and have never changed the filters, I think I submerged them in vinegar once cuz it said you can clean them like that in the manual. I turned it on half an hour ago and the room has gone from 50%-60% humidity. There's no mist, and its cool so no steam, there are internal fans which blow on the water making it evaporate. You'll feel the fan air coming out of the hole on the top. It's humid cool/room temp. air, so thats how it works. It has a nice nite light on mine and the 2 gallon one will last a lil less than 24 hrs. A 3 gallon may be big for some, but I wouldnt mind it,it'd last longer. But this isnt hard to fill up, 2 gallons is easy."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product!! I purchased it because of the Hunter name and and the advertised ease of use. However, it is very noisy and after just two months of use began to make a rattling sound. The humidity then seemed to not be working so I exchanged it for another thinking it was defective. The second only worked for 4 days. Then it also made an even louder rattling noise and had minimal humidity. The water was also always green even when using filtered water. It is very difficult to clean. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Disappointing Brand Name,"I saw this humidifier in Wal-Mart; however, the box did not offer enough information. Therefore, I researched it on-line. I liked the filterless system. Many years ago, I purchased a Duracraft humidifier but donated it a couple years later due to the expense of the filter. While I read the numerous reviews, I decided to try this product out of desperation.Pros: This humidifier separates easily for cleaning and refilling. However, when I went to refill the container, the gasket came loose, but the container did not leak.Cons: This humidifier noise level kept me awake at night. Also, when the water level drops down, this humidifier gurgles on the medium and high level.After two days, I returned this humidifier. I am looking at Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier V4500, which claims to be 27% quieter and more expensive."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I have owned at least 5 humidifiers and I believe this is the worst! The water in the bottom turns yellow and yucky stuff floats in it after one night of running...It's a pain in the rear to clean!!! and doesn't come clean very well at all! And to top it off, I've owned it for 3 months and it sounds like the motor is giving out already...when I put it on high it starts up good and then in a few seconds, it's barely running! And it doesn't feel like it's putting much cool mist out into the air either....Poor choice for a humidifier...don't waste your money!"
2,Okay for the $,"I bought this humidifier for a small living room. I love that it is easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and permanent filters. However, this machine is super loud. I have owned many different kinds of humidifiers, and I have to say this one is the loudest (of the wick filtered ones)! We have to keep it on med or low just to hear the TV. Unfortunately, unless it is on high, the humidity doesn't change much. I will replace this one in the near future. For the price, it helps a little bit without too much upkeep."
3,"Not added to the ""favorites"" list","This book began like gangbusters. I laughed so hard my sides were hurting. But...that became a problem, at least for me. I read a mystery basically for the mystery solving, the details, the revealing character traits of those involved. Lady Lupin Hastings is SO completely scatterbrained that I don't know how she could ever get herself from one destination to another much less solve a murder. After a while I found myself thinking she was too silly, too fey, too absentminded, too inane to be considered a real (even in fiction) person. Actually, she was not the one who solved the crime.I have read that Lady Lupin settles down quite a bit in the other books in which she is featured. Surely that has to be a good thing, probably a very good thing. Humor is great in a mystery but not when it totally overtakes the story."
3,99 explorer,"decent item , decent priceeasier to replace whole unit than bushings and ball joint separatealso bought passenger side unitonly 3 stars because -dust boot for ball joint was wrongwasn't the right boot and had to rig it to stay onafter put truck on the lift removing old control arm wasn't about to send this one back and wait for the otheropen your box when you receive just to make surenow the passenger side is a WHOLE other story"
3,"Nice try, but...","... this disc suffers from too few innovations (the fact of there being three versions of George Michael's ""I Want Your Sex"" contributes to that). The music is ""coldwave"" industrial with quasi-trip-hop beats in it (as seems to be the style in industrial nowadays). Cleaner sounds something like what Tool would sound like if Tool decided to be an actual industrial band, rather than a metal band with industrial leanings. Both bands are dominated by ""chugga-chugga"" guitar riffs and a thick undercurrent of bass. ""Condemned to Burn"" is all vocal samples about burning heretics and witches -- no lyrics. While it is an okay, short (about half-an-hour long) album, the best Cleaner song I've heard, ""Boogie Down,"" is, unfortunately, not on it. But if you like heavy guitars and ridiculing George Michael, this might be the CD for you."
4,A delight to read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was informative and interesting all at the same time. Well written with the author's own style. Every author has their own way of conveying what they want to say, I think Karl did a good job with bringing his thoughts and ideas across in this book."
4,Contemporary but not compromised.,"Highly recommended if you can still find it. A wonderful set of traditional tunes (not all Irish - Moldavia and Poland get a well integrated look-in) and Lunny originals given the odd boot by a modern rhythm section, rarely obtrusively so. What shines out are the passion and emotional tug of the outstanding soloists, fully in the Irish tradition. This is music with real roots, played with immense feeling - it's wholly modern and wholly Irish - in other words, it lives. On the fast reels the sense of a good pub jam comes irresistably across. I knew nothing about Donal Lunny and his illustrious status in Irish music, but was simply compelled to buy this CD simply through hearing an excerpt on the radio, which says in a way all you need to know about the quality of the music. The ultra-swinging ""The Mouseskin Shoe and Dancing In Allihies"" is worth the ticket price alone."
5,Cool Celtic Coolfin!,"Heard this on NPR's Thistle and Shamrock and knew I needed this for the collection. One of those rare albums where all the tracks are worth listening to! Some great tracks with slow and fast complex rhythms played together that make these guys worth their musical weight. Includes a track featuring Eddi Reader, another favorite of mine... Definitely worth a listen to if you like the traditional Celtic instruments played alongside the modern in a contemporary Celtic fashion. Will certainly be on the lookout for more albums from this group!"
3,more work needed,"My fisrt impression was wow, what a great product, until I used it....I have the Windows version and found the following problems:1.) Does not export to ACT, even though the product claims it will.2.) Does not allow you to import from one database you created into another.3.) Does not support contacts/addressbooks stored on a shared/network drive. If you have an Exchange or Domino server you will need to create a local file to store your contacts.4.) Could not get synchronization to work with two pocket PCs, and one Palm OS device.5.) character recognition accuracy is really poor for cards that have a dark background or pictures.The only plus is the hardware's small footprint. It is also a twain based color scanner which you can use to scan in old pictures."
2,Specifications as to size on amazon website is not accurate,"Reading on the amazon website that it was 40 mm (case size) , i ordered online.However i received 8938A instead of 8938 that is a 35 mm size"
1,Copyright infringement!,"For my class, my teacher made us buy this book and Freeman Tilden's book. Not only was Tilden's book more eliquently written, but it was written first. Beck and Cable's book literally copies Tilden's book almost exactly, but they do a poor job at it. Often they quote and refer to Tilden, so why not by his book instead? Interpretation is fairly simple, there is no reason to have two books over the exact same subject."
5,Excellent Service,"I received this book at lightening speed. It came 3 days after I ordered it and I paid the standard postage charges. Very well packaged. Book in modest condition, but that is what was described.Excellent service. Excellent!!!!!"
5,I wish I could give this book TEN stars!,"Like many other reviewers, I re-read this book once a year, always, it seems, when I am feeling ""under the weather"". Opening it's pages is like visiting with old friends, and I am always uplifted; I always come away with some new insight, too. At this point, I do believe I could recite whole passages of In This House of Brede. I love all the characters, and they are all richly drawn. I do get sad, thought, to think that this sort of life no longer exists. I would have liked to have lived it. Excellent, excellent. I owned three copies (two purchased on internet auction) and gave one away to a friend. Now SHE is hooked and looking for her extra copy too! You will love this book! UPDATE TO REVIEW: I have purchased the new paperback edition and while I am so glad the book is finally in release again, I am disappointed with this edition which is full of a surprising amount of typos. Honestly, you'd think they could do better."
5,One of the best Pink Floyd dvds,"I have the concert on tape, I had to find it on dvd. One of the best Pink Floyd dvds out there!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Video is lame,This video is very dissapointing. It seems the Floyd have given up on trying to re-invent their songs live they was they used to. There's really no point to this video. The visuals are okay but the thrill wears off quick. Just buy the studio albums if you like the songs--the live versions offer nothing new and no enhancement.
5,MASTERPIECE. The best live in concert effort in rock today,"It was such a pleasure to see that there are still some artists that put quality, effort, and passion into producing and editing a ""live in concert"" tape. It is obvious that they intended to have a full length movie (literally) on that stage at Nassau Collisium. I studied short film and television at Syracuse U and worked at the Emmys in NYC- I dare any record company or band to invest as much dedication and effort as Pink Floyd did in this piece of work. I have enjoyed watching this tape 100s of times over the years. ya ya I know all the avid PF fans and the Roger Waters issues but come on, as a video rental, there is no comparision. Virtually flawless editing. BRAVO!!!"
4,One of my best cookbook purchases ever,"I love to cook and very much enjoy learning new types of cuisine; although the recipes in this book are a little lengthy to use for quick weeknight meals, and the writing can at times be a little heavy-handed, the author does a wonderful job introducing an outsider to the many facets of Chinese cooking. This book formed a base for me, which I've since branched out from over the years, but I still come back to this one on occasion, always enjoy the recipes, and find the ""colorful commentary"" to be a useful addition to the book. It really does get you somewhat down the road to thinking like a Chinese cook; I know this as I've had Chinese cooks over to my home, and they are always surprised at my development as a westerner cooking eastern foods.If you want a sampling of what Chinese food really tastes like, and need a primer on ingredients and philosophy, this is as good of a book as I've found. Recommended."
3,teenage dirtbag,"haha. i really like the single, I have to say. But the rest of the songs get very lame, and I really should have gotten the single. But the cd is easy to listen to so I sugest that if you like the single...alot...then get this cd. my favs are truffles, and teenage dirtbag of course!"
2,Bubblegum Punk for the New Millennium,"I'm from LI and as far as I can tell, these guys have yet to play their first gig anyplace. Yet, somehow they got a major label deal, instant airplay all over the country, and their songs included in motion picture soundtracks. I love the record biz! What you got here is cutesy teenybopper bubblegum ""punk"", complete with lead vocals by a high pitched Nicky Gilder sound-alike (anyone remember ""Hot Child In The City""?). This is slickly produced nonsense, loaded with way-too-obvious hooks, and hyperactive performances. You can almost see the A&R guys drooling over all the money their gonna make off the 17 and under set. There's even a ""clean"" version so as not to offend the kiddies' parents and WalMart. Bah Humbug! On the other hand, if you have fond memories of Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Co. you'll enjoy this too. Oh well, at least it's not more N'Sync."
4,At First Listen...,"At first listen, the word stupid comes to mind. But listen again. And then again. Then possibly again. There becomes a very clear underlying genius. It's as if Wheatus understands that they are being stupid and most people will recognize it and shrug them off as another weezer clone. But at the same time, they are very accomplished musicians and if someone takes the time to look past the initial stupidity, they are bound to find a brilliant record worth listening to over and over."
2,New Age Translation,"Disappointing Taoist Buddhist Interpolation.This is Stephen Mitchell's Psalms inspired by David.that is ok, but lets be clear about it.Mitchell's trans of Rilke are superb, a god-send."
4,Works well,"I have nothing to complain about with this card. I owned a Fuji S6000fd and bought a '1gb xD M-type' card and thought that the photos were taking a little long to store and get the camera ready for a 2nd shot. Bought this 256mg H-type xD card - and guess what - i saw no difference in write speeds (ended up buying a D60). Not complaining though it does what it was made to do - store information. I've owned mines almost 7 months now - treated it rough, dropped it, stepped on it and even accidentally sent it through a wash cycle in my jeans and still works great."
2,Get the Multichannel Version,"I was also disappointed when I put this in my sacd player. Then I realized this is the stereo version, not the multichannel one that I had heard on my brother's system. I will be more careful in the future."
1,not a demon,I thought the movie was very bad.. it has nothing to do with Demons the first two..it is just full of nothing and a monster or OGre in a basement.. don't expect nothing much..it is a very bad movie
5,EXCELLENT,"Excellent series, keep you on the edge all the time, great to watch with your spouse, especially at night."
2,An Good Book that needs revisions,"ASP 3 Weekend Crash Course by Eric A. Smith is a good book to teach a beginner how to get started with Active Server Pages. The early chapters do a good job to ease the reader into ASP and provide him or her with a good foundation to build upon. Unfortunately this book has fallen victim to a number of typos, which can frustrate the reader. The approach of the book is to build up one's skills and then utilize each in an application (called eOrganizer). Unfortunately there are problems with some of the code and even the application that can be downloaded from the web site needs to be tweaked to work right.In summary- I feel that this book needs to be corrected and reissued. If all revisions are done, this book will be an excellent resource and worthy of more than 2 stars."
5,Great CD,"I love the music on this cd, wish there were a few more songs with actual singing but every song has a great rhythm."
4,Outbound Outstanding,"Outbound is outstanding! If you've never heard Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, you are missing something. These musicians are incredible. Hoe Down is as good as it can get! There are many other great ones on here such as the title track. The 'Tones are joined by several guests including Yes singer Jon Anderson, Shawn Colvin, and even Sandip Burman makes several appearances on the tabla(very cool)! There are 16 tracks on here so you get your money's worth, that's for sure.I would have given 5 stars if not for a slight lull in the action midway through. Hoe Down could be their big hit. I for one hope so!"
2,MAX 150hp!,"The piece looks good, and all the pieces are there. But there is a big sticker on it saying MAX 150hp, thats a long way from 300hp!"
5,good product,"love it! Recommended by my holistic pediatrician ln our first visit after homebirth. Never went back to traditional oitments I used with my first two children, and my baby never had rush ! He is almost 8 months old now!"
2,good..... for busy work,"If you want busy work for your child, these are a great series. They can do page after page on their own without much inquiring thought processes.Our school made parents buy these for the summer and I hated them!"
4,Good Summer Review,"Workbook is a fairly comprehensive coverage of basics of third grade. As with all supplementary material, parents/teachers may want to highlight specific subjects that students need help. I found the pace to be appropriate for summer days, and the writing exercises with prompts help even the most reluctant writers to try! I recommend this book to the parents of my incoming fourth grade students."
5,Fun and Educational,My daughter has enjoyed this book. I believe it is keeping her skills sharp so she will be prepared for 4th grade.
2,Nothing Major,Didn't see any huge changes from my stress. The effects don't last long maybe for me probably like 4 hours. The tablets taste great though better than the Gaba. These effects are much stronger (for me) when combined with the Stress Relax chain.
1,Falls far short of professional,"Wish we could be more encouraging about this review. The Magic Flute is an opera that lends itself well to varied interpretation and a new one holds promise, but beware here.The amateur singing in this performance should have ruled out its public release.. The singing ranges from actually shockingly bad (from the cute three boys) to better (from Monastatos).The orchestra is fine, but not memorable by international opera standards. The career promise of the young Thai conductor cannot be furthered by either by the high-school level the singing or the staging. The set consisted throughout of what appeared to be three or so large pieces of Lego in primary colors.Of two dozen dvds of this opera we purchased, this is the only one we ever sent back. Be warned -subtitles are lacking except when Papagano speaks in Thai."
5,so the begin starts,its wonderful handbook for all circassians and travellers also.i think little circassian childs can learn their past and their lands with that..there was much books about there but this is more useful then others.thank you.
5,Simple yet it works well,"The JR-2 works well on my Minn-Kota trolling motor. It is a very simple yet effective design that helps prevent transducer damage that is common with mounting transducers on the bottom of the trolling motor. Only one slight drawback, you have to make sure that when raising and storing the trolling motor that you keep the transducer side ""up"". There was really no way to prevent that issue since it is inherent to the design. I would suggest this product, and I would buy it again."
2,Couldn't wait for it to end,"We watched this video for the first (and probably last) time last night. What a snoozer! The video is far too long, and isn't designed for the short attention spans of most younger children. Also, there is a good deal of panicking and yelling when there is any mention of the mom going into labor (not only a poor example of how to react, but annoying as well). We were hoping that the video would have more segments of actual babies and families that were expecting, but unfortunately, there is only one short segment with non-puppet babies in it. Definitely not one of the better Sesame Street productions."
2,Pretty annoying and lacks realism,"My two year old is EXCITED about having a new baby. She is not scared. She does not need to see or hear (from this video and library books we have checked out) negative reactions. So, maybe when the baby comes, she will be scared or react strangely, but this video was awful. I wouldn't recommend it. Also, it was way too long for an active toddler."
1,Annoying!!!!!!!,This video was recommended by a friend so I thought it would be good. My son is 3 1/2 years old and loves TV and would not watch this video. I found it to be very annoying. It was dumb. Do not waste your money. I am going to throw my copy away. Huge disappointment.
1,not exactly what we were looking for,"When this last Christmas rolled around, my husband and I wanted to buy our daughter some new movies, and this was included. As we're expecting our second child in June, we thought this would be a good DVD to help our duahgter cope with the new addition. I not only feel cheated out of the money spent for it, but as this lacks any real substance or entertainment, I feel cheated on the time spent watching it. It doesn't seem to bring a postive spin to an expanding family, but shows it's ok to panic and resent the new baby. I don't reccomend this to parents at all."
3,A pretty good read,"This interesting little book is a collection of articles on different little-known facts of history. Each article covers two facing-pages with some pictures and about one page worth of text.Overall, I found this to be an OK book. Most of these stories I had heard before, so I was neither astonished, bewildered nor stupefied. The article on Admiral Zheng He made me wonder about the book, as it references the thoroughly discredited idea that the admiral had sailed clear around the world. Ah well, perhaps that's the cost of trying to present new stories from history, you have to go to less and less credible sources.Nonetheless, the book was a pretty good read, with a lot of interesting stories in it. The shortness of the pages makes the book great for quick reading, where you have to put the book down after little time to read."
5,Fun facts to share with others...,This is the most fun to read and 'trivia contest' your friends with!
3,Not as good as I hoped,"A good read, but most of the stories were already familiar to me and without the ""shock"" value, the book lost a lot of its draw.I actually found that the captions over the pictures(which actually were interesting) were often more informative than what was in the body of article."
5,Smashing!,I first heard this band on Jools Holland's Hootenanny New year '98. Their set blew me away. Months later I was still looking in my local HMV for 'Bring it on.' Finally I managed to find a copy and wasn't disappointed. I listen to it every night. 'Here comes the Breeze' is one of the best songs in my CD collection. Their voices are mesmerising and their style is from another era. They are a very subtle but powerful alternative to other Northern music. They emitt an intellectual and ironic edge that Happy Mondays and Oasis lack. First Class!
5,Pretention is out.,"These guys have a great, non-pretentious style...no tricks, no glitz...with even a few sour notes here and there for good measure.(I hear that they are the voice singing the Beatles tune 'I've got to admit its getting better` on those philips tv commercials-- which is a really great cover of that song .)A good CD for any collection."
5,AMAZING ALBUM,"This album is simply amazing. Atleast 4 or 5 songs that are true jewels. Great complex, multi-textured sound and feel throughout the album. IF your buying the song for ""Get myself Arrested"", go ahead, but youll be happy to know its got more hits on it. Another plus, these guys are huge SIMPSONS fans. Well, buy it and enjoy."
4,gomez only shine on this debut,"""bring it on"" is uncomparable to ""liquid skin"",i'm afraid gomez's talent has used up.in this suprising good debut,the mix of vocals between a young & old sound is cool & i think it's better than beta band's""three eps"""
3,Good quality but keeps getting off of cleats,Good quality but keeps getting off of cleats. My son already lost one. I would try something else next time
2,"cheap price, cheap quality","This product is cheap, which usually means cheap quality. I would of pay twice as much for a solid wood one that will last 3 times as much than this piece of particle-boards-made furniture and easy to be damage.I bought another set at the same time and both had problems; part were damaged. Prepac is the manufacturer and they will gladly replace your damaged board but it will take 4 to 7 weeks to finally have your piece together (in case the replacement part does not come damaged). It seems that they are used to.If you don't have enough money, go for it and use it as an ornament and be very careful when moving or assembling it."
1,Don't buy this product.,"In my life I have never wrote any review on any products I bought. It is my first time to do this just because this product is piece of crap. It started to fell apart just days after I assembled it. If the price was $50 I would not complain. For this price you can get something much better from IKEA, or even Walmart."
3,"works fine, but not great",the material is pretty cheap. but it was easy to put together and works fine for our what i needed.
3,Cheap Quality!,The price was reasonable but Its not real wood. Assembly not well point out and the plastic doll are junk! I had to go buy real wood dolls since they started to break on me when I try to screw (pound) them into place. I would pay more now for better quality then this cheap set I bought. Oh well you pay what you get.
4,Nice sturdy bench,This bench was very easy to put together. I did it by myself in about an hour. The plastic dowels are a pain to get in though. This bench looks good and is a great buy for the money that you spend on it. Can't beat it.
4,Better than the old black pan,"Though pricier than your usual cast iron skillet, this one has some really nice extra features. There's the tab across from the handle for a little help lifting the thing, and the pour spouts on the side. The grill marks make it a pretty specific pan though, maybe not so good for anything but meat and veggies. Excellent for searing steak on the stove and finishing in the oven. But sometimes it's nice to bake a tart or bread in the skillet, so don't toss the flat-bottomed one. Take the extra 30 seconds to handwash and dry cookware like this, you'll save its life and lots of dishwasher space. All in all, the pan is really functional and a lot more attractive than a plastic tabletop electric grill. I like the different colors in pans because I can just grab the one I want quickly--no monochrome in my kitchen."
3,A pleasant debut,"This was McFerrin's debut album as a jazz vocalist. As such, there are hints of the greatness to come, but nothing truly outstanding here.There's a fine duet with Phoebe Snow on the pop classic ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me,"" decent covers of Orleans' ""Dance With Me"" and Van Morrison's ""Moondance,"" and the highly Jarreau-like ""Jubilee.""Some of the characteristic McFerrin goofiness is in evidence in the silly cuts ""All Feets Can Dance"" and ""Chicken,"" and the soaring beauty of which he is capable in ""Sightless Bird."" But this is not an essential album -- more a not-too-challenging introduction for the newcomer and a necessity for McFerrin completists."
4,Wheatus [Edited],"The guitar stylings of Brendan B. Brown! The steady rhythm of drummer Peter Brown! Wheatus has all of the qualities of a highly evolved punk rock band, and the album has the sound that you are looking for."
3,For the hardcore fans only,"More like a 2.5 star review, but I guess the glass is always half full with me...There's a lot of rather obscure recordings here. Some of these songs are pretty good, but generally this is for hardcore Clapton/Page/Beck/Yardbirds fans only. Definetly not the place to start if you're new to any of these great guitarists. Somebody mentioned the sound quality sounds like they were taped off somebody's LP collection. Frankly, its worse than that. They sound almost as bad as ipods! lol"
3,Jumped the shark,This show just isn't what it used to be. Seems evident the writers are just reaching for a gimmick now...
1,doesn't work,I want my money back because I couldn't even get the video to work. I won't be using this feature again
5,beach balls,I'm sure everybody knows that this is a great show why else would you bother watching it are you heard from friends but it was great whatever
1,Died on me after a couple of months,"This deviced worked great until yesterday. Which for no apparent reason it stopped working. I tried it in 5 computers (Windows XP/Windows 2000) with no luck. Its dead, now I lost all my data. I don't recommend it."
3,The album makes me smile,"I bought the CD, and I thought, ""This guy kind of looks like Todd Snider."" Actually, his voice bears some resemblence to Mr. Snider's as well. I am not sure how to classify his music as he wonders in the margins of Rock, Country, Blues, and Pop -- he is kind of a more ""countryfied"" Ryan Adams. That so called Macedonia of music is my favorite area of music, so I was fairly pleased with the album. His great strenght is not in the phrasing though it is solid and will probably get better, but rather in painting a lyrical picture. The accompanying music and his voice really just kind of make you smile. A solid debut. He should only get better; if he follows the route of Snider and Adams!"
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book. The stories were wonderful, and warmed my heart. It spoke of the good, and a little of the bad in being an Amish women and raising an Amish family. Although, I can only guess that it seemed a fair depiction, I am not Amish, so I cant say for sure. :o)) It seemed to be written on an easy level, so an adult could breeze through this book quickly. I have read better books on Amish Life, but this one is decent. And the stories will leave you with a good feeling."
4,Good book,"I'm not finished reading it, but so far, it is interesting. I like reading about the Amish and their ways of living."
1,Skull and Crossbones,"It's Law & Order all over again. Even those of us who are huge fans are extremely disappointed that there is no sequential release of each series. Blatant commercialism triumphs over customer service again. Having purchased the first three series, I will now show my disapproval in the only way consumers can; with my wallet. I will spend not another dime on Frasier DVD's. It's ironic that here in Asia we are now subjected to ads encouraging us to boycott pirate DVD's and how it's morally wrong to purchase them (US TV sells for about $18 per series on DVD). Paramount should be aware that loyalty is a two way street; companies who abuse consumers in this way will ultimately lose."
2,Jumped the shark,Great show but jumped the shark and fell in during this last season. First 1-5 were better in my opinion...
1,Frasier the series 11,"I was very disappointed with my purchase as it came from America, however it would not work on my DVD so I had to send it back."
3,"Good Military History, Weak Political History","This was a good accont of the war against Tripoli from 1801-05, but the author was clearly writing to use it as a historical pretext for invading Iraq and Afghanistan. I don't think he suceeded there: he didn't establish enough parallels between Tripoli and Al Qaeda, and he didn't deeply examine Jefferson's views on war powers with primary sources."
3,A Blow by Blow description of America's first overseas war,"This is a highly readable popular history of America's first war overseas, against the North African Muslim pirate states, and why Jefferson came to the conclusion that America had no choice but to fight it."
4,Tunes,I bought this to replace an old cassette tape. Oh how time flies and things change. No problems encountered with the order. Great tunes.
3,Not for everyone,"Some Saga fans love this cd some don't. I personally can not see the comparison to older Saga music. Yeah, the 'bug' is back and the themes of the songs are the same but the songs themselves are not catchy to me and nothing stands out to me. I have tried to name my favorite song of this cd and can't.I have all the Saga cds and this one is my least favorite. It's just lacking the catchy riffs and keyboards that I like in my Saga music.Some Saga fans love this cd. I just aint one of them. Still better than a lot of the new music coming out. But if you really want to see what recent Saga sounds like buy House of Cards (HOC). I think it is one of their best works ever."
1,durability 0,"It worked for about five minutes. We all thought it was really cool...for the few minutes it worked.Given that shipping was 90% of the cost, I will not ask for a refund...But I would not buy one of these again. I bought it from a marketplace seller and am not 100% sure that it is the same one pictured, or sold by other sellers.All I can say is that my experience with this product was not good."
5,Essential Recording,"This is very, very, very good dub-laced techhouse (or techno, or house or whatever label of the trendy moment fits). Very sultry and sexual - the title of one of their tracks (on All That Glitters, their other album under the MRI moniker) says it best - this is ""Nightclubbing at Home""."
2,Landscape Drawing With Pencil,"Frank M. Rines book is the shortest I've seen, but, its straight foward and to the point. He shows how to setup your pencil and instructs on textures. Frank explains how very important drawing trees can be. His sample drawings are wonderfull."
4,As advertised,"Very Sturdy doesn't illuminate an entire room but it can totally spot light a good section as it was my original goal for purchasing this product. Very sleek looking, sturdy and bright enough not as bright as a mini mag light with a regular bulb but its perfect up to 10 feet away with its LED."
1,Didn't Work,"It lit once and that was it. I have another usb light made by Kensington, that is very dependable.Apparently you have to give the product one star even if it didn't work."
2,Just Okay,Nice and flexible but really needs an off and on switch. Did not work on powered usb hub had to plug directly to computer.
4,Not Bad works OK,Product OK. Kind of dim but worked for what I needed it for; back ground light booster. Good price
3,Fun,"This show is fun. But don't think that you are getting much in the way of story and plot. It is about 2min dialog, 5min soft porn...2min dialog..5min soft porn. Honeestly I would have enjoyed it more if they did a little less of the sex thing.... If I wanted porn I would rent porn...."
3,Entretenida pero muy lenta,"Me parece que esta serie no es lo mejor, es divertida y con muy buenas escenas, pero el guión es lento, los sucesos tardan mucho en desarrollarse y esto hace que se vuelva un poco aburrido, sin embargo si lo que te gusta son las escenas intensas, definitivamente te gustara."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm afraid Dante's Cove is not what I expected. Some things are OK, but in general I found it a bit boring, predictable and naive. The way in which characters dress, act, the way their bodies look is all too artificial. Even the sex scenes,too frecquent, extremely choreographic, extremely artificial. The idea is very good, though, but the development is weak, sometimes inconsistent. Yes, it is full of handsome people who seem to live a paradise-like live, but it is too unreal, even for a TV-Show on ghosts and witchcraft. Something funny is the fact that in some scenes you can see full frontal nudity, but in others it seems they are trying to hide it the usual way..."
3,Not great but fun to watch,"The acting is somewhat amateurish, and the plot & script are fairly predictable, but it's still a fun video to watch. With pretty, sexy people doing the acting, who really cares if it's not an award winning performance? I don't regret a penny that I paid for it."
4,Supernatural and Gay...,"Supernatural and gay, who could ask for more? I love shows that deal with the supernatural and I love glbt themes in shows. With this film I got both. I was in heaven. It does have the feel of a daytime soap opera, as opposed to a real movie, which is ok. The actors/actresses were all beautiful. All in all, it was worth the purchase of the DVD."
1,Pretty alone doesn't do it for me,"[This is an edit of my prior vicious review of this series. I still don't care for the show, but I met one of the cast members and liked him a lot, so I'm dialing down the vitriol out of respect for him.]This show is basically softcore porn strung together by a pseudo-gothic storyline. Not my thing. We got bored before the third sex scene and fast forward through the rest of the show."
5,DON'T TRUST,A FUN FANTASY SOAP. TRUE NOT A TIPICAL ONE BUT A CROSS OF DARK SHADOWS AND DAYS OF OUR LIVES.
4,"I could listen to this ""All Night Long (all night)"".","Even though this is only 8 tracks, before his ""Definitive Collection"" was released, this was practically his greatest hits album. It's not only full of hits, but some of them are his best ones. Included are the upbeat songs ""Running With The Night"" and ""All Night Long (all night)"", and the slower numbers ""Penny Lover"", ""Stuck On You"", and ""Hello"". ""Can't Slow Down"" is really Lionel Richie's ""Thriller"". Even the non-hits are good. Alot of people might prefer his collection, which also includes ""Commodores"" songs, but this is ""The Only One"" I need."
3,Will help beginners and intermediates.,Another nice book for beginners to intermediates. I generally find I have the same complaint with most bowling books. Not enough illustrations and drawings of the release. Showing works a lot better than just telling.There's just not enough useful information here for more advanced bowlers who want to graduate to the 200+ range...
3,Skunk plush did the job,I bought this as a gift for a dear friend who once had a pet skunk and had to get rid of it. It looked just like his old friend.
2,Not so plug and play.,"The first machine I pluged this into it work well. It came up as a card reader, but hey I was able to put some files on it. I have not gotten it to work on any of the 6 computers I have tried it on since. Old, new, win 98 (which you have to install the drivers for it), WINme, WinXP, it didn't matter, it never worked. I have Made sure that the USB ports were Enabled, and the whole nine yards. Now I'm trying to get technical support and the only page of the manufactures web site that is down(and has been for 3 days now) is the support section. It has been miserable, and I was so looking forward to it."
4,Works,"This product works well, it really helped me when I had to install drywall in my rec room. I would recommend this product"
4,Great CD I am very Happy.,"I had been searching record stores for the Song ""Baby I'm scared of you"" by Womack and Womack and was very happy to find it through on-line at a great price too."
2,Too artsy for me,"Okay, I get that this is supposed to be a profound reflection on what makes us human and blah blah - I know that because the overwrought soundtrack and shaky camera shots tell me this is ""dramatic"" and ""real"", but I found this movie pretentious and heavy-handed. Ewan McGregor turns in his usual excellent performance, and Eva Green, looking sickly and half-starved, adds only a little to the plot, although I do think she's a very good actress. I often like artsier films, but I found this one to too obvious in its attempt to get its ""Oh the humanity"" point across."
3,"I love Steel Pulse, but...","This is not their best. African Holocaust, Earth Crisis, and State of Emergency are."
4,stormy weather,"enjoyed the book, It was for my reading group. I happen to love mysteries it was right up my alley."
5,A kitchen must!,"If you love to cook big quanities or small this is necessary in your kitchen. I use it to brown meat, make stews or soups and even bake whole meals in this dutch oven. I have 3 different sizes and wouldn't be without them....."
4,entertaining and educational,"If you are someone who has not traveled much then this book can not only teach you about the outside world but can also give you insights in investig anywhere. I liked this book. He did not take himself seriously and his top-down thinking was certainly unique. If you want to learn about investing and about other countries then buy this book. I would like to see this become a TV series, much like Rick Steves' ""Travels in Europe"" on PBS."
1,Loves Lemon,"NOT THE ORIGINAL. Great Disappointment. Smelled like someone used old Love's baby soft mixed in lemon pledge and lots of rubbing alcohol. Arrived in tiny tacky plastic bottles as well. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy L'Occitane's Citrus Verbena Summer Fragrance (the very yellow looking one). It's seasonal, so get it when you can.Closest thing to the original Love's that I have been able to find."
2,Disappointed,"I was a fan of the seventies version of Love's Fresh Lemon--and the new stuff just ain't the same. A friend remarked that it smelled like lemon furniture polish. I wouldn't go that far--I'll grudgingly admit that it is pleasant--but the magic of the original formula is alas not there. And the fragrance doesn't last--rub on a generous amount, and an hour later it's gone."
1,The Perfume (faulty product) is spoiled by age,"This perfume is so spoiled that it smells like a drugstores no-name $4.00 a quart mens 'cologne'. The only lemon here was the product itself; which I had to flush down the toilet, then rapidly exit the room to escape the odor. It would have been nice if they would have let me know the ""perfume"" was long expired. I'm quite sure they are aware of that fact, and continue to rip people off. I will never spend another dime with this company again.The only reason I marked this review with one star is because the page would not advance without it--in reality I give it zero stars!"
1,Love's Fresh Lemon,This doesn't even smell like lemons. It didn't come with a box and there are no ingredients listed on the bottle. I know it's been years since I've smelled Love's Fresh Lemon and my tastes may have changed but a lemon smells like a lemon and this doesn't even come close. My coworkers thought it smelled like a floor cleaner and it does! Even my kids think it smells horrible. Perhaps I got a bad batch?
4,Nice quality and sound,"I bought this to hook up to my Yamaha AV stereo. The mic sounds great, my only wish is that it had an on-off switch, that would be great and I would have paid more for it, so it is not quite perfect withouth that."
5,Impressive quality at this price,This is my best mic for the price. The sound quality for the vocals is nice. Its very good for live performance due to low noise feedback.. will buy more
4,Good mic great price,Iam a mobile dj and i needed i cheap microphone to use for my dj gigs. I was suprised of how clear my voice sounded trough this microphone. So far i had no problems with it you cant go wrong with this mic. Its a good mic for a cheap price.
1,It's always ON,"Maybe others could tell that this Mic has no on/off switch, but I sure didn't know when I placed the order.Only consider this Mic if you can use one with no on/off switch. Returning.Edited: Taking one star off because as of 7/11/2012 the information on Amazon for this microphone does not say there is no on/off switch.Edited: Taking two more stars off because this vendor requires me to pay shipping costs to return this unit even though I got it just 2 days ago. Depending on how much it costs to return this Mic, I may end up throwing it away in the trash instead."
5,Stillness Speaks,"The spiritual quest made understandable. Tolle is able to communicate new ways of thinking that are life changing, and are not so esoteric to make you say ""huh?"". I would read ""The Power of Now"" first."
5,informative,easy listening one two three four five six seven eight nine tan eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
4,Stillness Speaks,"Eckhart Tolle's books are all helpful in our search for peace within. This book was very easy to read and something to go back again and again to read. My fiance borrowed it to read also. It was certainly very helpful for me to learn to live in the ""now"". Thanks to Eckhart Tolle for all of his enlightening books."
3,Master reality and optimize the power of your mind,"This book has some excellent insights but is dangerous for those who are struggling to find meaning and success in their lives. Let's face it, all we have control over in life is the power of personal choice, and if the mind is as bad as Tolle states in his books, then why does he use the mind (in the form of writing) to communicate his message??!! I suggest you take a sensible path to making the most of life by reading books such as Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self and The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People."
3,Book not as good as the title,"I was attracted to the title of this book, but after reading Eckhart Tolle's other books, I would tell you just to get The Power of Now or A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life's Purpose. They cover the same topic and are more interesting reads. Love Eckhart Tolle, but this book is not his best one."
1,A total waste of time and money,"The biggest regret that I have so far this year was buying this stupid book. I was expecting something like the Power of Now, but instead I got nothing like that. The book is poorly written and the publisher she seek professional help if he thinks anyone can take this book seriously. I was really disappointed. I will never buy another book from this publisher again."
1,Good copy,Tolle has managed to pull together the thoughts of the writers of present living and non duality and made the subject into his own. A good book for the beginner in this field. Anyone who has read widely will see it as just another self help book of which there are millions on the market. How do i know this book is useless. It made no difference to me. I have read this stuff years ago in a beginners guide to relaxation. As I say however it is a good start for beginners.
5,Great,This is the best Cars album and the only one with strong songs throughout. Their debut was great but it was downhill from there until they released this gem. What a pleasant surprise!!
3,good if you dont mind sitting 2 inches away,Ik First let me say you will never find a makeup mirror with better lighting that this one. The big problem is in order to get a non distorted view of yourself you have to have your face two inches from the mirror. any further away & its all BLURR.I returned mine even thought the lighting was beyond amazing. The one I have is 1/3 the price & no destortion. but the lighting is only 25 watt as opposed to the 100 watt of this one I have returned. I traded image for lighting as i can always add lighting. In fact if you have Vertigo even a little bit. This mirror will trigger it. Dont do it. I wound up with Jerdon Brushed Nickel Lighted Pedestal Makeup Mirror and am much happier
1,unreadable,I live in the Uk and i took this book out of the library to read.Other more important books got in the way till i had only a short time left to read this.So i started with the preface and couldnt believe the rubbish that i was reading.I have read all about HUAC.It was one of the most shameful periods in American history.Here was this author trying to minimise the hurt and injury inflicted by Kazan.Anyone who wanted to argue about the Oscar award was denigrated.It all stuck in my throat.I found his opinions offensive and i decided that i had better things to do with my time than to read this self opinionated drivel.Trying to rewrite history is a futile persuit.
2,Error in photograph I believe,A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg.
3,"Good idea, but","I thought these would be a good idea for potty training my 2 year old. However, by the time I peel off the stickers on the back and try to get it positioned, she is nearly peeing in her pants. I still carry an extra one in my bag, but often it is just easier to wipe the seat with a clorox wipe and then put down paper."
5,Love them!,"These are perfect for public bathrooms!!!I always panic when I have to take my daughter into a public bathroom that doesn't have toilet covers and even if they do they are so flimsy. The Dora Seat Covers are the perfect solution, they are even big enough for her to grab the side of the toilet. I have used them for myself as well."
4,Good purchase,"These potty toppers stick well to the toilet seat. I am pleased and will purchase them again. My only complaint is some toilets are shaped differently and they do not cover all of the seat so I still have to put toilet paper down. But for the most part, they fit most toilets."
2,"OK, so what's the point, Patsy did it?","The only ""gift"" I see is someone's becoming a psycic. What is JonBenet's gift to the world as the book implies? In the book ""JonBenet"" says that her parents are responsible. She also makes a one-sided judgement against the Columbine gunmen. Judging from a christian standpoint, I cannot fully believe that JonBenet--being in Heaven--saw only the negative product of high-school culture. Quite frankly, I question the truthfulness of this book based on that comment alone. I believe JonBenet saw more than just some people being stupid and shooting up a school for no apparent reason. A good read but something rather fictional than bona-fide believable."
5,"JonBenét's Gift ""A Miracle for the Millennium""","I found this book to be really interesting,especially since she worked for the Ramsey's. I feel it gave her an insight on what these people were really like. I hope the BPD at least took the time to investigate the things she says happened in this book. I feel if your interested in who murdered this child it gives great insights into this family.Thanks Jane in caring enough about JonBenét to write this very interesting book.You did a wonderful job."
2,Petfresh review,"This stuff works pretty well, but I hate hate hate the smell! it smells awful when you spray it and on your pet when you touch them."
5,A Must for parents and educators,"This book is a must for parents of ADHD children as well as educators. As both a parent of an ADHD child and a teacher, I found this book enlightening as well as practical. It is a very easy read, in fact, I read it in two days. It is easy to understand and is written in layman terms not scientific/medical jargon. It explains so many aspects ADHD is language that parents can understand and offers some sensible solutions to everyday problems. This book has become by ADHD bible."
4,My granddaughter loves it!,My 13 year old Granddaughter has suffered with ADHD and it's comlications all of her life. She loves this book that helps her understand others are going through it too and gives her hints on organizing herself and getting things done. It has made a difference in her life!
4,strikes the perfect tone -- with one caveat,"I think the layout and approach of this book is excellent.The use of vignettes and the input from ADHD youths is well implemented.Very useful material is presented, and presented accessibly.Excellent overall.... BUT ...The authors' caveat regarding medication is watered down. And it belongs IN FRONT OF the advice given.Pharmaceuticals are controlled for many reasons. The book should make it abundantly clear that medicines are serious business, and should only be considered after adequate consideration and in consultation with AND ONGOING SUPERVISION BY medical professionals.I'm not anti-medication. But I do think that this book is a little too glib on the seriousness of medication."
2,not durable enough...,"Started out great, then the switch stuck, and the cheapo plastic coating on the arm cracked up, then the flex rusted... so it's fine if you don't expect it to last more than a couple of years...Is a overall great idea; just shoulda been stainless..."
1,avoid this light,"Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased (from Amazon or any other place). Right out of the box the light didn't work. It was something as simple as a burnt-out bulb, but the light requires a special bulb that cannot be purchased at any normal hardware store."
3,Quite technical but good,"I like this camera, the viewfinder doesn't really block the view, just a little bit in the bottom right of the bit you look through, but it doesn't affect the pictures at all.I've taken good pictures with this camera.It's got lots of technical settings and buttons...so that's a bit complicated. But when I get the hang of it I'm hoping to be a camera genius."
4,Great Reference,"Polished reference work. Well written if a bit terse, but there is a lot of ground to cover in only 1000+ pages! Great cross references and index. Excellent and appreciated cross references within text and to on-line support sites. Not intended as a teaching tool. It has minimum examples and excercises. Frank about current bugs and inadequacies (few though they may be.) Overall, similar in usefullness to the ""Star Office Users Guide"", just a lot more information and a bigger package.Definitely worth getting if you don't have the user's guide."
5,Exellent for both StarOffice and OpenOffice.org,"I just got this book last night. I have read only two chapters about Calc (the spreadsheet component) and I already am much more proficient at it than before.I am running OpenOffice.org under Linux, both StarOffice 6 and OpenOffice.org 1.0.1 are basically the same program, except OpenOffice does not include a database component, and StarOffice has some macros and some clip art and some other minor things that OpenOffice.org does not have, but I digress, the book points out any differences between the two suites, I have found only one in the two chapters that I have read so far.Excellent reference and tutorial for both OpenOffice.org and StarOffice"
3,Sometimes it's not good to be true to character,"_ Deny They Father _ does a good job of explaining the difficult relationship between Will Riker and his father hinted at in a couple of NG episodes. The stories are about Will finishing at the Academy and Kyle, his dad, on the run from an unknown threat. The trouble is neither Riker is a particularly stimulating character and the emotional distance they keep from other characters impacts the readers experience."
4,Great book!!,"I was very impressed with this novel that gave us not one, but two very good stories. I enjoyed seeing Will's days at the Academy, although I wasn't too impressed with his classmates. I also really enjoyed reading about Kyle; he was a fascinating character.While this book doesn't have the epic scope of the other Lost Era novels, that's not really a bad thing. Sometimes it's nice to read a nice simple story where the fate of the Federation doesn't hang in the balance. With the exception of Will's Academy teammates, all the charactes were likeable. This was a nice, easy, quick read. I wholeheartedly recommnd this book."
5,Exceptionally well-written book.,"In this book, we see Will Riker as a Cadet and then an Ensign; we see his father; we see Katherine Janeway as an Ensign, and we see Owen Paris, father of Tom Paris, already an Admiral. The story centers around Will and his father, although the twain never do meet; already, they're estranged. The plot, both the main one and various subplots, are all handled well, competently and with flair. We get more insight into both Will and his father; not surprisingly, Deanna Troi is not the first potential love that Will has broken up with in the name of furthering his career, nor is it surprising that his father has trouble with relationships too.Not, perhaps, of interest to the reader who isn't already familiar with the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" background world and characters unless they would find a study of a disfunctional father-son relationship in which both men are reasonable, worthwhile individuals of interest, but definitely a must for fans."
2,"A Low rent ""Tropical Storm""","I was really excited when I read the synopsis of this book and couldn't wait to read it. Once I started it, I was sorely disappointed. First, it seemed awfully familiar and I didn't care much for Alex Madison's character. I still don't know why Taylor is attracted to her, after the way she is treated. It was a very difficult read. For a better working of this story, read ""Tropical Storm"" by Melissa Good. It's a much better read and you can't put it down."
5,"FAST PACED,EDGEY,AND SEXY.","MY NAME IS TREY WELLINGTON,I,AM A LAWYER I HAVE LITTLE TIME FOR YOUR AVERAGE RUN OF THE MILL BOOK.THE CORPORATE RAIDER IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IT KEPT ME CAPTURED UNTIL THE VERY END AND THATS SAYING A LOT.THE CHARACTERS ARE SO BELIEVABLE YOU,LL MISS THEM WHEN IT ENDS.AND ALL THE BEST NOVELS MUST END.I WILL MISS ALEX AND HER TAYLOR."
4,very entertaining,"Good writing style - a bit too much emotional b&d especially at the beginning, and the end was a bit predictable. But, in all a good read. Finally books that are thick enough to last me more than one night. THANK YOU PUBLISHERS AND WRITERS."
4,Gotta have a Webkinz!,"This was a present for my daughter's friend. She (my daughter) already has one. They are cute and the code for the Webkinz website make it two ""toys"" for the price of one."
5,Just Like Otis!,My boys LOVE the move Milo and Otis... and this is their little Otis. It's a great buy at $4.99 as an add-on price. Glad I found it!
5,Winning formula works again,"I love this album. It came out at a time when new wave was becoming popular and Linda Ronstadt was a great artist of the 70's . She's at her usual versatile best here. One of my favorites is the powerful remake of ""I knew you when"", which proved that Linda could still belt out a tune with the best of them. One of the greatest performances I've ever heard on an album is the unbelievable ""the moon's a harsh mistress"". It's simply breath taking. The song is timeless. Easy for you to say is also a great song of heartbreak which linda does as good as anyone. Mr. Radio is haunting and beautiful. The rest of the album is good stuff as well of varying styles of music from country, new wave and rock and roll. Something for everyone."
1,Saved by Oingo Boingo...,"I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash."
3,a decent hodge podge,"This is set out in A-Z fashion with each entry being a paragraph of two on a variety of classical music topics. If you like this kind of thing it is nice to dip into and can sometimes be useful of yield new or unexpected information. For example one of the entries explains the various parts of the Roman Catholic Mass and this was useful for me as a Choral music fan. I also liked his explanation on orchestras. On the other hand it is far from comprehensive and I am not sure what guided the author in his choices. So I can only give it a somewhat lukewarm recommendation - its OK, just about."
1,"Functional, but frowned upon","While this book will help you get a functional qmail installation, it does so in a way the qmail community frowns upon. A much better guide to setting up qmail is LWQ (Life With Qmail) avaible freely on the web. The author of LWQ has also written a more comprehensive guide call the ""qmail Handbook"".In short if you're looking for help with how to set up and administer qmail, this is NOT the guide to follow."
3,Good but not great...,I thought this provided only basic instruction with regard to qmail. I wanted a book with specifics enough to do advanced mail forwarding and other options that I know qmail is capable of doing. I didn't find the necessary information in this book and had to dig it out on the net myself. The book was detailed in only a few areas. I give it an average rating.
5,A great book written by soldiers who fought in the battle,Gettysburg is a well written book by two soldiers who fought in the battle. COL William C. Oates fought for the Confederate side and LT Frank A. Haskell fought for the Union side. Each soldier captured his side of the battle in great detail. The stories are well written and easy to read. It is very interesting to read about the different viewpoints of the battle. COL Oates gives a great analysis of why the Confederates lost the battle and how they could have won it. I highly recommend this book for all fans of the Battle of Gettysburg.
3,HOME AGAIN,"Judy tries to branch out with pop rock on this recording with some country thrown in. The title song HOME AGAIN is however a beautiful duet. ONLY YOU and DON'T SAY LOVE have a definite pop beat but surprisingly Judy does a great job on these tunes. YELLOW KIMONO does tell a tale of a husband who leaves on a business trip and sends home a Kimono, but never returns home. EVERYBODY WORKS IN CHINA (oh yeah, oh yeah,) so what??? This tune should have been cut from this project. The other ballads, FROM WHERE I STAND and THE BEST IS YET TO COME are musical and lovely."
4,Interesting Novel about seemingly nonfiction events,"Amidon depicts the city of Newton as a man made utopia of modern society. Which seems rather far fetched, however most of the story is based loosly around the real attitudes and events of real life pseudo utopia of Columbia, MD. The interest level of the book becomes exceedingly high when you know every street that is refered to in the novel and the racial struggles that are still present to this day. The detail of the book does often tangent a little off the main plot line, but is usually brought back in due course. The relationship between as the characters at times seems incestuous, but so are the relationship in the world of Columbia, MD. If you live in suburban Maryland this is a must read, even if you are not the story is intriguing enough to make this hard to put down."
4,Well Worth The Price!,Well written and put together. I'm a fan of Wiley books and this one was no let down. I think the author did a commendable job of dealing with a very complicated issue.
4,"Performs as advertised, very convenient","Nice little speaker set, very convenient for laptops, love the usb powered feature, sound very good, I listen to movies with them,, not a replacement for large 4 speaker sets if you need hifi for music though. For this I would go with a nontravel oriented speaker set."
5,Great laptop speaker and fun software,"I've had the Tritton Sound Bite for about 4 months now, and use it with my Lenovo T60 laptop, which has weak sound. The Sound Bite more than makes up for that, allows me to hear softly recorded educational material better than with headphones, and plays music beautifully. The USB 3D Sound Configuration software that it comes with allows a multitude of settings, including 12 equalizer presets plus roll-your-own settings. For educational material the ""Vocal"" setting works better than the flat equalizer that I would get without the software. Since I travel a lot for work, the small size is a very big plus."
4,I am simply amazed with these,"I recently moved from a 17 inch Powerbook (with really nice speakers, good and loud) to a 12 inch Powerbook (much smaller, with speakers you can't really hear in a crowded room). I got these speakers on a whim for use in anime conventions (we display movies to our products on the Powerbook), and I was really impressed with them. Bass that you can really feel, good quality sound, and tiny portable size. Best of all, these are USB powered, which is really elegant. They also work fine with Mac OS X (10.4 in my case), and without drivers of any kind (very nice and Mac-like)."
5,laptop speakers,"The sound that comes out of these small speakers is amazing. I expected something a little tinny sounding , but they have excellent sound for their size. The software that comes with them is great, allowing a wide variety of setting for bass , treble etc. Great speakers for the money."
5,the best of what's out there,"My old iPod died and I was faced with the dilemna of what to buy next. Stay true to Apple, even with all of its problems and mine unexpectedly dying? I was VERY tempted by the new Gigabeat, and the only reason I didn't get it is because there are no accessories for it. No cases, car chargers... I don't need anything fancy, but I do want to be able to charge this thing when I'm driving between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Plus, I already had most of the accessories I would need for a new iPod.I've had this new iPod for about a month now and I am very happy with it. GET A CASE. I don't use it for video or photos (why you would want to watch something on that tiny little screen I just don't know), but for music, it's great. No complaints... yet :-)"
3,Didn't work but CMTraders was great,"Bought iPod after my old one got eaten, but it error-ed out when I tried to sync to my iTunes. Sent it back and worked with Mike who put sons on it so it wouldn't be at a restore point. Got it back and it synced but then errored out on a bunch of songs. Returned it and got a prompt refund. Would definitely work with CMTraders again despite failed iPod"
2,It's worth buying,"I love this ipod and it is the best thing to have. I would have bought it long time ago, but I waited too long. The price is kind of high, but it really worth it. With this 60GB ipod I am able to download all of my pictures and music and it is very convenient to carry it with me where ever I go."
5,I love it.,"I have the 60GB black video iPod and it's awesome. Sleek, well-designed, sexy and built like a little tank. I love iTunes, and the latest version is great."
2,Better hope you get a good one,"I purchased a 60 gig i-pod 31 days ago. Last night, it started making funny noises and locked up. Today I took it back for a replacement, and guess what?? 1 day too many on the return policy. Thank goodness I purchased a 3 yr service plan. Well, the techs told me they would send it in to Apple, and I should have it back in 4-5 weeks. If I would have known this in advance, I would have passed on any Apple brand. I own 2 Sandisc products, and I love both of them. See what happens when you want to keep up with all of the ""Jones'"" Very dissatisfied with Apple. Maybe my apple had a worm in it....."
4,Very Good,This Is a very good iPod!! Only thing is that I am very used to the newer iPods and iPhones with the solid state Hard Drives! When i got the iPod i could feel the Hard Drive spinning on the inside! When watching movies It spins the whole time. Something to get used too!! Other than that it is a very good iPod!
5,realisitk,This new iPod is an excellent piece of equipment. This is my first iPod and I am impressed with the features. It is a must have for music lovers and video lovers. The only thing that I can complain about is that it could be a little more durable. I say this because it scratches easily but that is nothing a case could take care of. Another flaw that I seen is that it is not compatible with Windows Media Player. That is really a preference though but I think I can adjust to iTunes since it is easier to use. Other than that this new iPod is great and I don't regret purchasing it.
4,My first IPOD experience has been a good one (so far),"Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed my ipod. The software is outstanding compared to other mp3 players that I have owned (this is my fouth one.)I had to try a couple of times to sync with my pc for pictures and addresses, but in the end it worked out perfectly well."
5,very good product,"I think that the iPod is just a MP3 player , but is more than I player, I had now all my music and my digital photos."
2,Accessories 4th generation do not fit,"The only advantage of the 5th generation over the 4th generation is that it plays video. Unfortunately, all my 4th generation accessories, such as italk, do not fit the 5th generation ipod. Therefore I have to buy them again when they become available. What a waste of money."
5,When will Amazon actually be stocking these?,"I bought it, but my account shows delivery in mid to late November...When will Amazon actually be stocking and shiping?"
3,"annoying, but catchy",this version of Stand by me is one of those songs that is so annoying that it is practically addiciting. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to bother someone.
1,Disaster,Just made this. Followed instructions on packet. It called for 5 cups of water -- no way. It is a soupy mess we cannot eat. Seems instructions on packet are a bit off.
2,"$, That's All It Is","I was just listening to the sound samples, Eminem's mom is talking about how excited she was about her sons success, no she isn't. What kind of person sues their own son?And as for that song, if I were Eminem I'd have made a reply record to those clowns telling them where they can go shove it. They have no idea what went on between Eminem and his mom and they're just trying to make a few extra dollars too."
2,It reads like a parody,"This claims to be an academic study of body modification. When I started reading it, I thought I was reading something published by The Onion. As I read more, it seemed as though it was really an academic study. Reading even more, I began to see that this was due only to its form, which is accurately patterned after the learned writings of academe. I still can't decide whether this book is a very clever parody of academic work, or a real report of very un-clever academic activity.After 20-30 minutes of reading this potentially interesting book, I gave up in boredom and disbelief. It has nice pictures of cutting-edge ""far out"" people with interesting tattoos, piercings, etc., but other than being good for a few chuckles, the text is a near-total waste."
5,PT 109,I read this book many years ago and was happy to recently acquire a copy for my personal use. The book was well written and I was pleased with all facets of the transaction.
5,METAL FANATIC IS A POSER RETARD,"SLAYER SUX,GET RIDE THE LIGHTNING, ITS A FINE METAL ALBUMMETAL FANATIC GO KILL YOUR SELFA QUOTE FROM KING DIAMOND, "" I AM YOUR DEATH HAA HA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,the guy below me is correct...,"... i'v been a big slayer fan for many years and i can tell you that they are indeed death metal, been to many slayer concerts in my life, the guy below me is right, slayer is death metal, not thrash. slayers music is too technical to be considered thrash, its death metal."
5,Yeah!,"Metallica fans seem to always cite this release or Master of Puppets as the band's best. (Personally, I'd go with ...And Justice for All if the production wasn't so bad.) There's not much need to go into detail here, this is iconic album."
5,The Invasion Continues,"A natural follow-up to Metallica's ""Kill 'Em All,"" this album proves that Metallica wasn't about ready to give up the 1980's underground metal revolution. The band matured from ""Kill 'Em All"" with ""Ride The Lightning,"" where they showed that metal could be more than obnoxious and could actually have social and political messages. Ranging from nuclear war to the Ten Commandments to an Ernest Hemmingway novel, Metallica showed they weren't your average Spinal Tap. The music on this album is utterly amazing, with classical and acoustic intros, pounding rythmic sections, and solos that are earsplitting at times and bluesy at others. An all-around great album with a beautiful instrumental partly written by Dave Mustaine ending it as a masterpiece."
5,Great Cd,This is one of many great Cds by Metallica. Fade To Black is on of my favorite songs on this Cd. Anyone who likes the songs which start off slow and then build up into excellent guritar playing would like this song. With all Metallica songs remember to turn the volume up to 100.
5,Epic,"Popular belief is that Master of Puppets is the greatest Metallica album. Not true. MOP is very good but not quite at the level if this stuff. Every song (exept Escape and Trapped Under Ice) is a cult epic.1. Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 -Very outspoken song, a must listen2. Ride the Lightning 12/10 -My current favorite Metallica song. must listen NOW!! Lyrical genius I must say.3. For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 -Exellent song. It hooked me into Metallica4. Fade to Black 11/10 -Amazing song. Enough said.5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10 -Not an album highlight but still a good song.6. Escape 8/10 -See above7. Creeping Death 10/10 -One good song right here. It is simply amazing live, when thousands are screaming ""DIE DIE DIE""8. The Call Of Ktulu 11/10 -Simply amazing. In my humble opinion, I like it better than Orion or To Live Is To Die80/80 A+Don't be discouraged by these ""low points"", this is an epic album!"
4,Ahhhh nostalgia!,"A truly great album that I still remeber from Junior High Beer Bashes. While I have moved on from metal in general, I still give this a listen to every now and then. ""Creeping Death"" and ""Call of Ktulu"" still manage to grab my ear, while ""Fade to Black"" is the albums highlight. This record will definitely impress you, especially if you've only heard the albums they have made since they became creampuff rockers."
5,truely one of the best,"Ride the lightning is one of the best thrash metal albums of all time.But I still don't know which is better, Ride the lightning, or master of puppets....... anyway, the tempo for this album is very very fast.But there is a song called ''fade to black'' which takes a break from the high speed thrash.Fade To Black is probably the best song on the album.Even though its not high speed thrash, its still a classic ''tallica'' song.Notice how i said the words high speed thrash more than once, because thats what makes Ride the lightning!!! Actually, my favorite tallica album is ...and justice for all.But this is still a classic."
1,"Don't ride the lightning, ride the Anger instead.","How did this awful crap get 5 stars? I was a big big fan of their albums Load, Reload, and the awesome St. Anger, so I decided to give this one a try.First off, the bass is awful! I'm so glad that Cliff died, because he tried to play bass like Limp Bizkit and failed. Also, the songs are abysmal. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, they try to emulate St. Anger and put no solos in it, but it fails. And Fade to Black is an obvious attempt to be emo, but it did not make me want to cut my wrists. All the other tracks on the album are bad as well, and James' voice sounds prepubescent.Get St. Anger instead."
3,Just don't pay any attention to the lyrics,"The huge step forward since the debut album is obvious immediately when you put on ""Ride the Lightning."" James Hetfield's vocals are tougher, more confident; ... and the songs themselves are beginning to branch out into more complex structures and melodies.But the problem may be that a good chunk of the album is just an extension of the fist-pumping silliness from ""Kill 'Em All."" The difference, of course, was that we expect that kind of stuff on a debut album when the musicians don't really have any idea what they're doing, and on Metallica's first album the guys seemed to be having a blast. On ""Ride the Lightning,"" the musicianship has improved drastically, yet the songs themselves are stuck in heavy metal fairy tale settings. (""Trapped Under Ice"" and ""Creeping Death"" are particularly embarrassing.) It would take another album for the band -- particularly the songwriting talents of the late bassist Cliff Burton -- to reach maturity."
4,Very very good,"I like almost every song on this album. The only exception is I think ""Escape."" Other than that song, each song on here is a piece of history. It must be bought and listened to many a time."
5,Blows Kill 'Em All Out of The Water,"This is one of the best Metallica albums, behind only Master of Puppets and the self-titled ""Black"" album. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade to Black"" are two of their best songs, and there isn't a bad one. The songwriting is a HUGE leap over their debut, with some of their best lyrics, not to mention countless classic riffs and solos. This is a must-have."
5,"A close second to Master Of Puppets, but still amazing","I'd honestly like to give this album 4.5 stars, but since i can't i'll give it 5 since it deserves that more than 4.I'll make this short and sweet, while this isn't the best album done by Metallica, it holds their best song: Fade to BlackThat song alone is worth paying the 16-18 bucks for it. The guitar riff at the end is brilliant and sticks with you for days...The rest of the songs on the cd are excellent as well, like Ride the Lightning, The Call of Ktulu, and For Whom the Bell Tolls. The one weak link is Trapped Under Ice, but that's because its surrounded by so many better songs.It basically gets down to this: buy this album. Now! (Unless of course you don't have Master of Puppets and you only have 17 bucks in your wallet)"
2,"Potential's there, but too many weak spots","The highlights of this album are clear: Fade to Black + For Whom the Bell tolls. The rest of this is just plain boring. Unfortunately, this is one of the more overrated bands of all time, but kids just can't see that becuaes there are so few other bands worth listening to. Save your money or go buy some old Judas Priest - it's better than this noise."
2,too depressing for me!,"The reason i choose to stay away from heavy metal bands is simply because their way too heavy and depressing which to me is quite dumb and any music that will put me down isn't for me! I have to say tho i enjoy the song ""fade to black"" great tunes but the rest is just way depressing and realy way to heavy and gives me head aches! Buy any thing from u2,guns and roses,pearljam,iron maiden,,Jimmy hendrix,black sabbath,ozzy,lep zeplin, deep purple,trouble,hush,Eric clapton,ramones,red hot chile peppers,the beatles,Elvis,Rob stuart,Madona (some songs), stone templo pilots and much others !Leave metallica alone!"
1,didn't work and had to return it.,"As soon as i opened the box, I could tell it was badly made and did not fit my need to be sturdy as I wanted to take it along our house."
5,Awesome!,"Our baby slept in our room in this moses basket until he outgrew it at 2.5 months old. I set the basket on my bedside table, so I could just reach over and pick up our son when he needed to be fed without ever having to get out of bed. The basket with the gingham bumber looks really nice, and now I use it in the nursery as a cute place to keep stuffed animals. Because of the low price compared to most other moses baskets, I honestly thought the build of this basket would be quite cheap, but it surpassed all of my expectations. It is sturdy and durable, and even the quality of the little mattress is just fine for a newborn. Although, I never did use the hood on this moses basket because it didn't seem to fit quite right the first time I used it. Five stars for this moses basket by Badger Basket- it made life much easier with a price we could afford!"
1,Poor Design and Construction,"I had bought this for a friend, when I received it I was extremely disappointed. The construction is poor, the basket is flimsy, it is very cheap looking and feeling. I'd never trust it to put a baby inside and its not even worth it as a decoration."
1,Bad craftsmanship,"Just saw this in the store, reached for it happily - it's a nice simple design compared to all the frilly bassinets - and then my smiles ended...the basket itself is shoddy, not firm, and I wouldn't trust carrying it around with a load of laundry, never mind my baby! I saw of the few places the bumper was tied to the basket that one was broken, and I pulled lightly on another tie - poof! broke off. A newborn would have same strength, and you'd find the newborn with the bumper pad over him/her. I thought the product was very dangerous, and it made me angry that such poor craftsmanship is being sold for newborns."
5,The Best of Everything,"THE 2-CD BEST OF THE DOORS has it all: the best remastering, the best songs, the best program lineup--and, best of all, Jim Morrison's voice & persona comes through strong, seductive & clear.It just couldn't be better.Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi HendrixElectric Ladyland"
2,Morrison's voice is buried in the remix,"I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews. While listening to this compilation, I found myself straining to hear Morrison's vocals. Botnik's remix has definitely lowered the volume of the lead vocals in relation to the rest of the music. It's a shame that such a good compilation is unnecessarily compromised by a bad remix."
2,Yet Another Best Of...,"The Doors are dead. They only released seven, short studio albums. Why are they still making Best Of's? Because you suckers will still buy em.A confusing array Best Of compilations:- 13 [1970; 1 LP - 13 tr]- Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine [1972; 2 LP - 22 tr]- The Best of the Doors [1973; 1LP - 12 tr]- The Best of the Doors [1985; 2 CD - 19 tr]- Greatest Hits [1980; 1 CD - 12 tr]- The Best of the Doors [2000; 2 CD - 37 tr]- The Best of the Doors [2000; 1CD - 21 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors [2001; 1CD - 16 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors [2001; 2CD - 24 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors [2001; 2CD - 40 tr]- Absolute Best of the Doors [2003; 2CD - 34 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors [2007; 1CD - 20 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors US [2007; 2CD - 34 tr]- The Very Best of the Doors Int [2007; 2CD+1DVD - 34 tr]- The Future Starts Here: The Essential Doors Hits [2007; 20 tr]"
3,Please put some volume on for Jim's track!,"I have the first release of all 6 albums on CDs, and wanted to see what a remixing/remastering did to the Doors sound.Pros: 1. excellent instrument sound remaster - very clear and crispy sound; a pleasure to listen to. 2. Selection is fantastic - I would probably compile it the same way if I had to do it myself. Well, would probably trade Not To Touch the Earth for Wild Child, and (don't kill me) the End for the Soft Parade.Cons: See the title of my review. I mean, it is not that bad, but it is bad enough to give this compilation 3.5 stars despite all the pros."
5,Can't believe the price I got for this.,"I love the Doors. I couldn't believe one day when i was browsing through the MP3 section of Amazon and I found this normally 18.00 album for 5 bucks!! It was a steal and it's loaded with all their greatest hits including; ""LA Woman, Lover her Madly and Light My Fire"" I recommend for any The Doors Fan."
1,Questions,"How did a musical lightweight become a legend then? How is it that the legend refuses to die now?I suppose his early death lends some weight and credibility to his morbid ramblings, but what does his poetry even mean?You can't judge a book by its cover, well the Doors are the cover without the book. Who'd mistake it for a book anyhow?What's so unique about the Doors' sound and how have they been mistaken for a real band for so long? Isn't it obvious that they spread themselves dangerously thin trying to play music?Why is this package still in print with the release of ""Greatest Hits""?"
4,The Door's-opened me up to music that's smart.......and fun,"My dad got me hooked on The Door's and just wanted to say that this CD is great and I love Jim Morrison's doomsday prophet sounding voice. I could listen to the radio-and get a wad of bubble gum pop music in my ear or I can pop in this CD and get music that's real, that was made for the sake of making great music rather then just used as a catalyst to getting on TRL and making millions. This CD has songs that I've never hear before from The Doors, like the Crystal Ship, and now love.I also recommend Fleetwood Mac and The Eagles."
2,Avoid if possible,"I bought this UPS when I was an Emerson employee. It was fine for the first 12 months or so, but then it failed. I replaced it with a cheap Best Buy branded UPS about 24 months ago and it has been functioning better than the Liebert PA350 ever did."
2,Almost tasteless,"Wow I bought a box of 12 packages based on the other positive reviews but I am so sorry. These are basically tasteless. They're very very gummy/chewy, barely resemble frogs and are just generically sweet. I'm going to find people to give the remaining 11 bags away to. So sorry I bought these. If you are expecting anything like regular gummy candies, these are not them!"
3,unique capability for >12 hrs laptop time,"I purchased an Electrofuel (now Electrovaya) pp160A for my compaq laptop two years ago when they first came out (at the time Electrofuel in Canada was just transitioning from a tiny startup company to a manufacturer). It worked as advertised (I think the puffing up comment is nonsense) to provide clean power for extended intervals with 4 hr recharge. This week it has worn out and now I am purchasing a new one despite the high price tag because nothing else compares to this product. Electrovaya says to expect 300-400 recharge cycles before it dies, so 160w unit preferred over 120w unit to give you the longest amount of time before having to replace this pretty expensive battery. It gets 3 stars because 2 years is a bit short for a $400 product (look around on the internet and find cheaper prices...)"
3,Not self-supporting...,"Contrary to the picture shown,the sides and botom of these 'chests' have zero rigidity, so you can't use them as drawers in the way you might an underbed box. An internal frame would be a big help. That said, they seem well made. Fine for seasonal stuff you don't swap out much; the breathable cloth and cedar bits make for nice longer term storage."
5,"It's truly ""So Easy""","Many people think that making your own baby food must be a lot of work, but the name of this cookbook says it all. It is really quick and easy. A small investment of time produces a month or more of food for your baby. I even went one step further and blanched my vegetables or baked them in the oven since I am not keen on using the microwave. I appreciate that they suggest at which age specific kinds of food can be introduced so as to help avoid food allergies. The suggestions for medleys and herbs/spices that can be introduced later on are also fun for offering variety. It is worth putting in a little time and effort for your baby by making your own baby food. This cookbook makes this process so much quicker and easier."
3,Easy baby food ideas,This book has very quick and easy baby food ideas. Will be very useful to the working mom who wants to make her own baby food.
4,Red is Ravin',"Painting it Red is one the best Beautiful South albums so far. I was a bit dissapointed in Quench but they have come back with a bang! I saw them live at the MEN last year, and am going again in December. If this album is anything to go by we should be in for a brilliant night!"
3,Stick to the older release,"I've bought the XSLT Programmer's Reference from the same author and it's a terrific book, so when XSLT 2.0 came out, I immediately bought it ... only to be highly disapponted. The previous edition (or the original book if you like) covered everything you need to know (or ever wanted to know) to become an XSLT 1.0 guru. This one contains half of it, the other half is in another book (XPATH 2.0).While I understand that XSLT 2.0 has expanded so much that XSLT+XPATH don't fit into a single book (plus it generates more revenue for the author and the publisher), buying this book at the current point in time (where there is very limited support for XSLT 2.0) is a questionable choice. You're much better off buying the older version, which covers (the whole span of) technology used in actual products."
2,Mysties Beware,"I'm a huge fan of Mystery Science Theater, so I thought I'd enjoy this movie, but I couldn't have been more wrong.The idea of a recycled movie is interesting and unique, but the jokes were just not that funny and were pretty vulgar. Yeah, I know it's called ""Sex Galaxy,"" but honestly, I felt like the dialogue was written by a group of 13 year old boys.The only reason I even forced myself to finish it was because I paid 5 bucks to rent it.I know it's SUPPOSED to be a cheesy movie, and we're all supposed to chuckle at the stock footage, but this movie just didn't hold my interest."
2,Don't listen to Takomora or wutever his name is,"Takomora has no idea wut he's talking about. Staind is one of the best bands out there. Nothing compares with Aaron Lewis's vocals, staind is great this cd is not"
1,Very fragile,This is a nice statue but it arrived broken in it's original packaging. The seller refunded my money but I was still dissappointed that I didn't have a nice Dragon. I did a little research and found out that the statue frequently arrives broken. Manufacturer needs to improve the packaging on this delicate item.
5,HIgh Stakes Indeed,"Mortal Stakes, the third in the Spenser series, is wonderful on many levels. It is more than just about baseball and blackmail and a lone wolf PI taking on underworld thugs. It is also about relationships: between couples, between business partners, between a sports idol and his fans and also his teammates. Parker handles all of these relationships well, with the plot twisting down to a somewhat surprising end: the hero is not who you think! Excellent read - I highly recommend."
4,"OKAY, THAT WAS FUN!!!","After reading 300 ""SPENSER"" 's here is one that I missed, I think??What a pip!!! No cell phones [ha!], no HAWK, and only a small doseof SUSAN. That was fun reading an early version of our fun-lovingP.I. !!!"
1,Gross!,"I like My Scene Dolls but these have just gone too far. I think that these are so ridiculous and ugly. Oh, and one more thing. You people need to work on typing because practiclly all of you're crap is spelled wrong. I think Bratz dolls heads are too big and I'm not trying to be mean."
2,Not worth the money,"So, I bought this in anticipation that it would actually help me. How come it BROKE after using it for just 3 months? It was handy to use to attach the diaper bag to the grocery cart and the stroller, but there are similar products in a hardware store that are more durable and cost less! Oh well, lesson learned."
1,flimsy spring/closing mechanism,"I'd give this product less then one star if I could. The hook's spring or whatever makes it snap back together broke the first time I depressed the lever to put it on my stroller. Literally popped off--never to be seen again. I love the idea of this product, but it might be better to pick something up at REI."
4,Great for shopping.,I have a Peg Perego stroller and this fits perfect and does not slide down as long as the gripping material on the hook meets the gripping handle on the stroller. Great for diaper/nappy bages and shopping bags. Just be careful not to overload or the stroller will tip unless you have a very sturdy/heavy stroller. My advice is to get 2 of these. One is not enough.
4,Steve Hillage - 'BBC Radio One Live' (Griffin),"Steve Hillage was,of course the guitarist for Gong, 1973-75. This CD was the first disc of his I've ever heard. The fabulous sounding ""Hurdy Gurdy Glissando"" and ""The Salmon Song"" were taken from a 1976 solo outing. All other cuts are from a 1979 gig, like ""Electric Gypsies"",""Activation Meditation"" and the state-of-the-art ""The Glorious OM Riff"". A nice Gong-related item to add to your listening stack. I'd LOVE to see Hillage reunite with Gong sometime."
2,Oh My!,"I read the reviews for this play and expected a little more. The concept of the play was great but the flow was not. The music could have been totally left out and I woud have enjoyed it more. I've seen many plays which included Tony Grant so I did have expectations for the caliber of this play and was left disappointed. If I would have seen a preview of this play, I would probably have not purchased the DVD."
1,awful movie or play,This is a awful stage play I would not waste another dime on this stage play it has no meaning or depth to what the play is about. Don't buy it you would be throwing away 10 bucks plus shipping. it is not worth it.
3,Strange Edition,"This is a strange edition, by Boomer Books, that I ordered when, after 4 months, the complete works were not available. Neither the translator nor the cover artist(Paul Seurat) is credited, and the preface and introduction are not dated.The stories themselves range from wonderful to sketchy, which may be a reflection of how much more shaped and polished (for better or for worse) contemporary American short stories now are. OR it may reflect the selection of stories. Having just read ""Bel-Ami"" (his splendid, finely worked novel, Oxford World's Classics), I wonder if the uneven nature of ""Selected Stories"" isn't due to selection process used by Boomer Books.Incidentally Boomer Books (NOT large type-just above average-but for readers in their prime-they make a big point of this) is a great idea, but only IF the books they publish are also great."
1,I returned them.,The sound quality was horrible. Possibly the worse I've ever heard from any type of headphones. they did not get loud. they fall off. they echo and returned them with in 2 days of having them.
5,Zalman Headphones... Perfect for gaming,"Zalman Headphones are a great addon for any serious gamers. You can hear pretty much anything around you while you play FPS's. I have personally tried other headsets such as the Sony MDR-700DJ's and they didnt even compare. There isnt much bass, but its such a small loss in the big picture. Make sure you get a Creative Labs LIVE 24 BIT card or any sound card with 4 plugs. Dont hesitate; they are the best. All your competitors at a LANParty will be so jealous."
2,Confusing truth with mythology,"I enjoy books about Lincoln, and thought this one would help to explaln the truth of the man versus the mythology of the man. It did; however, it was sometimes confusing as the author switched from one to the other quickly, leaving me confused at times and going back for a re-read. Eventually, I got bored and did not finish the book, looking forward to reading one of the other books stored in my Kindle."
5,fun for kids,"Read along with Nemo provides a great opportunity for your kids to learn. It has such great characters and fun that it really keeps childrens attention. It's great for either at home with mom and dad or in the back seat of a car on a long trip. If your child liked the movie Finding Nemo, then they will love this read along."
5,great product,this is the second alpha shield that we own: office & at homeeasy way to keep off the web while using the computer for other functionsgreat security device...
3,"The fit was small, needed a larger size",The show fit tight and too snug. Should have bought a half size larger. I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with this shoe. I was encouraged to purchase them for wearing at a tradeshow. I don't think I will event take them with me.
2,"If the shoe fits ,,,,,,","These shoes, Softwalk Women's Adora Slipon, did not fit me. That may not be the shoe's fault but none the less I can't wear them. They were an extremely good price with the company discount and my points earned. I had tried to wear them on 2 occasions so I couldn't return them. However, they fit my daughter very well and she loves them. They got a 4 star rating from her."
4,Nice ballet inspired lower body workout,"Great workout for the legs. Some of the moves are new to me, but I like them! I think I will invest in the other two workouts in this Ballet Body series."
3,DECENT BASIC POWER SUPPLY,"I purchased this in order to repair my wife's ailing PC when the old one died but I found out after installing what I thought was the exact replacement that it wouldn't communicate with the motherboard as it was a ""switching"" power supply that had separate 12v power for the newer multi-core processors. (Even though it had the EXACT model number as its predecessor). It's a decent, basic power supply but if you are only replaceing a blown older PS be forewarned - This may not won't work with your older MB. It ended up that I decided to upgrade the rest of the computer as a result which ended up being a good thing (if a little more expensive than I intended.)"
1,humm what was ordered?,Received the PS today and box was correct....but PS inside the box was not! This is why i don't normally order froman online store because the pic and description is not what u get.
2,not strong.,"this socket is strong, but not strong enough to take off some canister filters. mine snapped when removing a corolla filter."
1,Broke at weld on first use,"I bought this and it broke the first time I tried to use it. The weld that holds the nut to the body let go. I bought the Assamecher and it worked just great, it is a solid cast piece of metal, the same that my Lexus dealer uses."
1,broke during first use,Do not buy this product!! It broke during the first use. The part that connects to the socket wrench snapped off while I was attempting to remove my oil filter.
1,Smaller than advertised.,"Did not fit oil filter housing on 2009 Toyota Highlander, counter to other reviewers. Maybe they made this unit a millimeter or two smaller than before. Disappointing."
1,this thing sucks.,Broke first time used. Don`t buy this bs. Had to left old oil filter because of this thing. Worst money expend ever.
1,Not for Toyota RAV4 2009,I bought this KD3253 oil filter wrench after being misled to believe that it would fit my 2009 Toyota RAV4. What a big mistake! It just wasted my money and time. Hope this will help if you are a 2009 RAV4 onwer looking for an oil filter wrench.
4,good for a toyota,fits a toyota engine just as well as the factory tool does.i would recommened this remover to anyone who works on toyotas
1,KD 3253 End Cap,"This thing really is a piece of junk. Would not fit my 2010 Rav4 at all. The nut that you put your 3/8"" drive into broke off before I could even use the tool. The wrench I got had two levels of diameter. The first level was too big in diameter and the second level was too small. I bought an Assenmacher ASTTOY640 and it fit perfectly. Don't waste you money on the KD end cap."
1,I feel ripped off!,"I was charged $20 for a $5 plastic wheelbarrow. How do I know it's really a $5 plastic wheelbarrow? For one thing, I purchased this same wheelbarrow 2 years ago from Walmart for $5. The main reason I know it's a $5 wheelbarrow is because even though it came from American Plastic Toys Inc. there is a ""Walmart"" sticker on the side of the wheelbarrow that says $5. Don't buy anything from this company. I never will again. I am very upset. Since the wheelbarrow has a $5 sticker on it, I think I should be reimbursed $15. I am so disappointed.Wheelbarrow"
4,Light weight rollater,"Excellent to keep in your car because of its light weight, takes up very little room and folds very flat. It would be nice if it had a seat. Then it would be ideal. The tan plaid color makes it easy to locate among other walkers and rollators."
4,using the 3 wheel rollator,"I find the rollator very easy to use, and the large wheels are a definite plus in the city, where streets have cracks and ruts.However if you have weak hands because of Arthritis you may find the brakes difficult to use., and the rollator can move awayfrom you quickly."
2,Mini Lite Walker,"I had borrowed a mini lite walker from a friend and loved it. I find this one I bought to not be the same quality. It's not as stable, feels very loose even after tightening it up several times. The paint is not as pretty and the handlebars are silver color instead of the red flame. If it wasn't so much trouble to pack it up, I would return it."
5,LOVE IT,"I also bought a four wheeled walker and gladly don't use it. I am a youthful 55 yr old woman with ataxia and need the walker for balance. I often keep this unlocked so I can squeeze between chairs in restaurants, etc. This walker looks ""younger"" and I love the stability it gives me. I walk in my yard; I have to be careful, but it's quite good on rough terrain. I still drive and can easily fold and lift it into my back seat. I appreciate the hand brakes it has for the few times I've been on steep ramps. I love this walker."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! THEY SEND WRONG ITEM THAT IS UNSTABLE!,"Ordered this for my mother but when it arrived it was TOTALLY UNSTABLE!!! Just realized that the item sent is not at all like the one pictured! Redesigned??? ITis NOT USABLE! It would cause ANYONE to do a header with just the lightest of touch on the handles! Because I received this item right before an out of town trip and did not realize the item was not what I ordered, it was TOO LATE to return it! I cannot contact the medical supply company that shipped it be phone...cannot find the number and now have spent $100 for a piece of equipment that is not only unusable but actually DANGEROUS!~!! I am very angry and want to make sure that no one else makes this mistake! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
3,This Album IS Overrated!,"I love new music from new artist and I was hyped to get this and listen to what a lot of critics hailed as brilliant and the next ish. Once I got it I was diappointed. The single is the beat record on here and his production on other people's records are better than what's found on here. He is a great artist and producer but next go round you need to showcase that. Example of less hype but great content is the new T.I. album ""Trap Muzik"" which has David Banner production on it. I think that Banner will come correct next time. At least I hope!"
3,okay but not worth my money,nothing new just some fools taking up where 8 ball and 3 6 mafia left out.
3,A bit dissapointing,"Well this album is alright and i like david banner as an artist n all that but not to sound like a hater but this album is kinda weak, lyk this album is probably worth it entirely for the song like a pimp which is jus awesome but with the exception of that ""might get cha"" and ""fu*k em"" this album has no other really good songs and i was hoping for better. I reccomend this album if you are a big fan of crunk rap and like the song like a pimp alot if u only think like a pimp is an ok song then my advice would be dont bother."
2,2 Stars,"Like A Pimp is a very catchy song, but this album is still not anywhere near good. It's full of garbage throw away tracks and is NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,"Still good, but...","I loved this book as a kid, and bought it for my nephew. I started reading it to him and realized it is a bit sexist. Still a good story in the end, and good art. The copy I got was in poor shape."
3,"Okay, but not a favorite","My kids, especially my 6-year-old, like this CD. The lyrics are clever and funny, and what kid doesn't enjoy belting out ""Are We There Yet?"" or ""Bad Mood Mom"" as she rides down the freeway? I don't hate this CD, but it's definitely not my favorite, either. The songs get repetitive, and the last several are pretty boring (even my kids much prefer the first half of the CD). If you wanted to go to the effort of making your kids their own roadtrip mix CD, the first several songs on this disc would be good additions."
5,"unusual, musically interesting, my six year old is addicted","Someone gave me this CD and when I first played it for my daughter, age 6, she listened to it again and again. The best songs...""I'm Six,"" and ""Little Sister"" for instance, really get into the head of a child. I enjoy the music too and think this CD deserves wider distribution."
3,everything was great until...,My little bro had this and we used it often at the park. It was a great toy for about a year until I was pushing him around and out of nowhere it just broke into pieces! JUST like one of those videos on AFV. It was pretty funny....but the bike went in the trash after that.
5,Ruben Blades is a master!,"This is a must for any Ruben Blades fan! Every track is fantastic! The lyrics give you goose bumps! Just like you remember from 20+ years ago. It takes you home. ITunes only has a few tracks available, not the whole album, so get the CD while you can."
3,Monkey Bridge,"I enjoyed this glimpse of Vietnam that came from a perspective other than an American soldier.I will say that while I loved the images of a peaceful Vietnam, the story never really took off for me. I knew what was going to happen early on in the story.I think this is a good story about what a mother's (or parent's) love entails. The final selfless act to free her daughter of her haunted past was hard to understand and admirable at the same time.3.5 stars!"
5,Worked Great,I've had my printer for almost 2 years now. Started getting the streaks... Order this part and the problem is fixed.
2,High hopes,"I had high hopes for this workbook, based on the sheer number of lessons, colorful cover, and price. At first, I was disappointed by the ""slick"" pages that don't hold pencil well. It doesn't matter how hard you push on the pencil, you still can't see the writing very well. Erasing, even with a good quality eraser, is impossible and just leaves smudges. I was going to use this (along with manipulatives) for our main math curriculum, but there was next to no instruction and I found it to be a little too fast moving. I ended up giving these books away. I would only recommend using them as a supplement by topic, not as a methodical, cover-to-cover workbook."
5,Great Supplementary Math Workbook,I bought this to supplement our 1st grade math curricula and it's exactly what I needed: Another form of math practice that builds on itself all year long. It is thorough for first grade math and my son will be well prepared for second grade. Great book!
3,"Math Made Easy: 1st Grade Workbook, Ages 6-7",Book delivered earlier than it was scheduled. My son liked this book so far but he found page no 113 has pencil written answer by some one. since I bought new book it should be unused but this was not. I did not expected this from Amazon.
4,Great for summer time review,"My son just finished kindergarten so we purchased this book to use over the summer as he gets ready for first grade. We have completed about 12 pages so far and it is a review of what he already learned in kindergarten, which is great to keep this knowledge fresh. The pages offer a variety of activities and provide easy to follow instructions. The only draw back to this book is that the pages are not perforated so I am having to tear them out of the book to make it easier for him to do his work. I would recommend this book as a review or supplemental source for teaching math concepts."
4,"Not perfect, but good","Using this to homeschool my son in 1st grade, and he really likes the book. The pages are glossy, though, which makes them harder to write on with a pencil (although it holds up well when he decides to push too hard with his pencil) and harder to erase. As others said, the subjects jump around and seem pretty random, but he seems to do well with the variety rather than pounding away at the same topic in math for days on end. Recommended."
1,doesn't work,"I tried this product on two seperate occasions.I followed the instructions accordingly and nothing happened.Well a total or 6 to 8 hairs were on the strip,that is really nothing.But then i figured that my skin may have been a liitle dam.The second time about a week later i tried it i reread the instructions carefully and that time only two hairs appeared on the strip.So no i wouldnt recommend this hair remover,cause no hairs were actually removed.This product is a waste of money."
2,Ouch!,"NADs is known to remove hair quickly and not grow back after a certain amount of times you use their product. I ordered this kit and used it...it was so hard to remove the wax from the bowl it came in without making a huge mess everywhere, and because you don't warm it up it doesn't glide onto your legs easily. The wax strips run out quickly, and even though I washed them with soap and water they shrunk so I couldn't use as much wax the next time around...I did not enjoy using this product."
5,Near Perfect Likeness of Saint Padre Pio,There are a number of Sterling Silver pendants of St Padre Pio that one can find in the market but not as near perfect likeness as this one. This pendant is also well made and I am very pleased with the overall quality.
5,Just like being there...even if you're not a pilot.,"Wilson is an extraordinary story teller, and while these stories are of great interest to pilots, they are enjoyable for non-pilots as well. He brings a warmth and humor to his work that every reader can appreciate. I heartily recommend this book!"
4,911,"This single is one of the most powerful singles on this CD. It is strangely hypnotic and intoxicating. Mary J. Blige's and Wyclef's soulful and mourning renditions play out the scenario between the couple beautifully. I love this song. No matter how many times I listen to it, I can go back again and feel the emotions Wyclef and Mary are attempting to communicate. A wonderful expression of a love that can never be."
5,The Go-to Glass Grinder!,The Glastar Superstar II Grinder is very easy to use. Glass is shaped and dulled at the same time. Clean up is easy.
2,Only buy it for Anna,"Anna Nicole's brief onscreen appearances are the only plus side of this movie. While the ideas were fun, the stereotypes were sad. Also, Alexis Arquette and the rest of the ""Santa Ana Annas"" were terrible! Their wigs were cheap, costumes predictable and not really Anna Nicole enough. We have better wigs here in Boise (and better Anna Nicole impersonators, I might add). Alexis Arquette screams her way through a sad script. Allana Ubach and Antonio Sabato Jr.'s performances were nice though. This could have been executed a whole lot better."
2,Rather disappointing,"The description gave the impression this book would be more advanced in detail, documentation and descriptions or drawings. It would be a fine book for someone just starting to show interest in clothing of Medieval times (more like a book for a youth).Nothing wrong with it other than that."
2,nice ..just not the right one for my pan.,This is probably O.K. It just did not fit my pan. so I've never used it.The company gets an A for service and packaging.
5,I approve of this software,"I started using WE back during version 4. Since then, I have seen some great improvements and some less than desirable ones. Overall, this is a program that is relatively easy to use, once you sit down and spend time learning the different pros and cons of it.I have used other WYSIWYG programs, and this is the one that I find myself going back to all the time. I actually use it more often than not, when I am designing simple sites.The features that are included are nice and easy to learn through a little bit of trial and error. But once you have a good handle on all of them, you are blowing out good quality sites with little work.I highly recommend this software for those who are interesting in building a simple website for their own personal or professional use."
1,Not for existing website development,"The box sounds like it allows site development, but it only lets you create a site from scratch in its own format. I wanted to use this program to maintain sites created with other tools (not necessarily Frontpage/Expressions) - it is not good for that at all."
1,"Mac users love American Heritage, too.","I'd love to be able to review this CD-ROM, but you didn't make it clear on your website that it's only for Windows users. So I'll be returning it to you, along with my request for a Mac edition; after all, it would be nice to be able to boot up the world's best CD-ROM dictionary on the world's best computer."
3,Worth a listen.,"I've always liked this debut album from Toto. It's almost as good as Toto IV, but not quite. Toto IV is just a bit better than this disc. All of the songs on here are listenable and energetic. The album does sound dated, but that doesn't take away from the tunes. Personal favorites are ""I'll Supply the Love,"" ""Georgy Porgy,"" and ""Takin' It Back."" Steve Porcaro's vocals on ""Takin' It Back"" are really nice. Steve Lukather is a good guitar player and lead vocalist. I've always liked his vocals the most compared to the other Toto singers. This album sports good production, musicianship, and songwriting. It's worth a listen."
4,Love Toto,I have loved this album forever. When I got this album I played it three days straight and dreamt about this music.
5,Hard to beat,"Very good, I don't know if this is the best nori that I've ever had, but it's good and for the price it's just about impossible to beat.The sushi mat is pretty good too. Smelled a little bit off when I bought it but that has worn off now. Not a bad deal overall at all for a mat + 50 nori."
4,Dokken at its heaviest,"This ranks at second as my favorite Dokken album. The album starts off great with the threatening instrumental Without Warning. Then it kicks right in to the lead track Tooth and Nail, one of the heaviest songs in Dokken's catalog. The album's got a good edgy production and has many great songs: especially Into the Fire, Just Got Lucky, and the popular ballad Alone Again. Good album."
4,One of the best vintage melodic rock albums,"This a is a very strong heavy metal album. It has the speed in ""Tooth and nail"" and ""Don't close your eyes"" as well as the hooks and the melody in ""Just got lucky"" and ""Heartless heart"". And of course you get a ballad in ""Alone again"" (remember this was released back in 1984). Don Dokken has a great voice, and together with George Lynch ability to both play and write, this is an album clearly above the average standard in this musical line. My only objection is that the production/sound could be a lot better - I don't know what a re-mastering is able to do for this album, but it wouldn't hurt to try. Anyway, don't let that scare you away from this great effort!"
4,"I LOVE ""EVERYTHING I OWN""!!!!!!!!!!!","The song ""Everything I own"" is an awesome song. My parents used to listen to it. Then, once my boyfriend let me hear it and I hadn't heard it for years. It totally applied to how our relationship was going and it's been our song ever since."
2,too much & not enough,"I had all of the singles in the 70s and there are a few to many songs that arent really good here + they left out the 1 song they rocked out on Mother freedom. Hearing all these songs back to back made me name it the whiney CD, never the less 2 or 3 songs at a time and they have some great classics- Im looking into a more concise collection of thier HITS. EDIT>>> Maybe 2 stars is to low- after getting a 5.1 reciever I got to say this cd has about the best sound you can get without a high def format If you likie bread this is the way to go- even if you have to skip some songs."
2,"Cute, forgettable songs","Bread was a band that mastered the concept of songs to work in an office by. Unobtrusive with little lasting value, Bread's songs pass through your ears like a sun shower on a field, momentarily pleasent and then quickly forgotten. The Anthology collects the best of their particular style of music."
1,THIS STINKS.,It smells nothing like vanilla.Its is all musky and disgusting. And it is so tiny..it comes in a roll on bottle.
4,Black & Decker Battery,After going through different websites we were glad to find the Black & Decker Slide Style Battery on Amazon.com. Finding the replacement battery saved us from buying a new power tool for my husband.
3,Bought for my toddler,"The shirts are much bigger than she is, so if you would consider your child more of a 'bean pole' (tall and skinny) you might like the Faded Glory shirts better... so far those are the only ones that actually fit her. I thought that at 3 years old this product would fit better."
1,Very basic book,This is a typical basic book with no real help or new dicoveries. There has got to be a better book out there.
5,Great for beginners or experts,"This book explains most of the terminology involved in candle-making, as well as explanations of different techniques and step-by-step instructions for getting started. Each style of candle described includes a list of equipment needed and great photographs of the finished product. There is a detailed description for each style of candle and hints on how to overcome more difficult steps. Each style of candle is followed up with the exact making process, including notes on the author's personal experiences and failings (and how to avoid repeating them.) This has been a very enjoyable book. It was also my first candle-making book."
3,Not as advertised,"The picture and the description on Amazon shows ""Grass Gator 5095 String Trimmer Line"" to be 140 feet. The package I received is 128 feet. Same barcode numbers and 5095 product number but the words ""New & Improved"" replace the US Patent number. If they think ""New & Improved"" means less string then I've got a bridge I'd like to sell them.Update Mar 25, 2012. I tried to return this item but Amazon said it wasn't necessary to send it back and issued me a full refund. Now that's customer service!"
5,wonderful summer practice book,I think this workbook is great for covering all the subjects needed for the coming year. Some of the work is review which is good for retention over the summer but can be boring for quicker learners.
5,Hive Management: A Seasonal Guide for Beekeepers,"I was very happy with my purchase of Hive Management: A Seasonal Guide for Beekeepers. This is my first year as a beekeeper. While other beekeeping books explain every aspect of beekeeping, this one condenses what the beekeeper should be doing at each part of the year and what to look for for the health of the colony. It's a quick look up and read book. It was just what I was looking for. It arrived much sooner than expected."
4,"Good performance, but don't forget a good heat-sink compound","Overall this ""all copper"" Thermaltake fan-cooler cooled down my Mobo in an order of magnitude of about 10 Celsius, and my Prescott CPU about 7 Celsius. I was expecting more, but the heat-sink paste used was far from good. I expect to improve the performance with a better heat-sink compound. And don't forget that copper is far superior to aluminum as a heat transfer material. Recommended for Prescott P4 CPU users."
4,Thermaltake TR2 M12,This is a good cooling option for your CPU. I have used a couple of them now. I will advise you that they are advertised as ball bearing fans but when you receive the box it will tell you one ball bearing and one sleeve bearing. Hopefully they have placed the sleeve bearing in the non load position so that it does not fail first.
2,Not what I expected.,"First off, the clips are a pain to attach and remove. After adding this heat sink to my board (P4 3.0GHz, Arctic silver compound), the cpu temps hovered around 55 degrees on idle (and thats without overclocking!) and increased to the high 60's under load. I removed this and inserted my old TT Volcano 7+ and now the temps are around 43 degrees on idle. The heatsink may have been improperly seated, but I'm sticking with my old Volcano."
2,Noisy,I bought this because I thought the original Intel CPU fan was too noisy. This one is just as bad if not worse so it was a waste of money for me. I didn't have any of the problems installing it that other reviewers seemed to have.
5,Excelent New Band,"Depswa's ""Two Angels And A Dream"" album is a great mixture of melody and a good, meaty guitar sound, soaring choruses and catchy hooks. Tracks 1 and the title track are probably the best on here, if I had to choose - track 5 reminds me a little bit of HIM, too (which is good).If you like Ra, Trapt, or From Zero (the closest reference point in my opinion), then definitely check this band out. While you're at it, check out Smile Empty Soul, Finger Eleven and doubleDrive, too.Highly recommended for anyone who likes the melodic-rock/metal scene."
4,Underappreciated,"I find it amazing that Depswa is so unheard of. The only reason I heard them is they were briefly featured by Coke FM. I have never heard them on the radio. Depswa is an awesome band, one of my favorite by far. I am very picky about what I listen to, so for this to even rank is a pretty big deal. One thing that I really liked and noticed about this album is that the songs are all different. They are all about different things, some romantic, others sad, etc... It's bands like this that truly deserve the airtime that the radios waste playing trash. Thanks to ClearChanner Communications I guess. But yes, you NEED to buy this CD, you will NOT regret it."
4,"Great book, hardcover edition quality is very poor.",This is a fantastic book and it deserved a great hardcover edition. I recommend you buy the paperback instead of wasting your money on the lame hardcover edition.
5,An incredible adventure to share with a child!,"I had never known about this gem, written by Julie Andrews, until a friend loaned her original copy of this wonderful book to my son and I. We have tremendously enjoyed reading this action-packed, colorful and inventive story. As a parent, I appreciate how this well written fantasy values innocence, encourages creative thinking, awakens the imagination, and weaves challenging words and ideas into a story any child, young or old, will appreciate. My son and I both enjoy the predicaments and wonders that the characters encounter in their travels. We will be revisiting this book and the wonders of a magical place which also enable us to share some magical time together. I highly recommend this as family reading"
5,Whangdoodle love passes to daughter,This was one of the most memorable books from my childhood. I read it again as an adult and still found it to be magical. I introduced it to my 8 year old daughter this year and she loves it too. I am so glad it is still being published - it's absolutely a delight to read.
4,What an imagination!,"There is so much creative power at work in this story, it's wonderful. I'd give it a ten (on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being highest) for the imagination alone involved in creating all the creatures in the story. Read it yourself and, if you don't like the plot, at least read it for the fascinating descriptions of all the creatures in it. Oh to have an imagination like this author! It was great. I found myself smiling and giggling like a little girl while I was reading it. It's a great conversation piece too - how many discussions are about ""whangdoodles"" anyway? :o) Great read!"
5,Umbledumbledumm,"I first read this book in 8th grade (a long long time ago) It has remained one of my favorites and I buy it as a special gift for children of my friends. My best friend and his girlfriend gave me a copy for my college graduation and I still re-read it. It's one of those special stories that is always fresh and new.If you ever want to know how powerful, wonderful, and beautiful imagination can be, you must read this book. Then read it or give it to others. Even Prock would agree to that. :-)"
5,This book is a treasure to pass on to readers of all ages.,"I read this book for the first time when I was in the 4th grade. In the last 23 years I have read it countless times, wearing my cover thin. Since becoming a 4th grade teacher myself, I have shared this fantastic story with my own class every year. Each time I finish it, my class erupts in applause and wants to hear it again. I'm presently without a voice after reading the passage about the Swamp Gaboons yesterday. Julie Andrews is known world-wide for her lovely singing voice. What a pity it is that her literary contributions are the world's best kept secret."
4,This album is very close to me,I love it! Blood of Christ is great! I wish the Close to Me version on the album was like the one with the horns
4,it tastes like nothing on earth,"dark Kyoto Song aching soaring urgent Pushnervousjumpyexaltation Close to Methere is much here. this album is happy and searing and dark and lovely.elise asks, why does it end so sadly sinking?"
4,1985 sounded this good?,"Picking a favorite Cure album is like choosing between air or water, hard to do. This might not be my absolute #1, but ""Head On The Door"" is the first Cure album I really knew note for note, and completely absorbed. What I love about it has been said before, it's mid-way through their best years, and is as diverse as it is excellent. It's got the hits like ""In Between Days"" and ""Close To Me"", the odd-balls like ""The Blood"" and ""Screw"", and the moody pieces like ""Kyoto Song"" and ""Sinking"". Their next album ""Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me"" might one-up this disc, but ""Head On The Door"" is still 37 minutes of primo Cure. It was the soundtrack to my pizza-delivery years."
5,WOnderful MEmoRies!,"Lately I've been feeling the old pull of certain music from my past and this is definitely one of them. Robert Smith's voice and just the bassy sounds in some of their darker songs will always bring me back to their live shows, standing in the dark, under the stars with the smell of clove cigarettes in the air. Heaven...I've picked up some of the cd's from a ""newer"" and yet now defunct girl band, Jack off Jill, that has very obvious Cure influences and yet are totally their own band, edgier and heavier.They were the ones who brought me full circle-back to The Cure."
3,"Nice pictures, lame writing.","My 3-year old boy loves this book. He asks for it nearly every night. The pictures and pop ups are very well done but the writing and meter is horrible. My husband and I can't stand the writing. We are still trying to figure out how ""roars"" rhymes with ""paws"".On another note, our version doesn't mention anything about poop. :)"
2,Helmet with limited options,Product offers only 2 sizes - large and small. Large was too small for me. Had to return.
2,sizes are off,"the difference between the large and x-large is 58-59 with the small/medium at 55-56. huge range, i know.way too small for me."
5,READ IT - great distraction from everyday life.,"A truly enjoyable book and fine distraction from everyday life (or afterlife). The pace kept up; I laughed out loud, felt suspense, and rooted for the heroes. The characters were believable and the type you could have an enjoyable evening draining beers or blood, as the case may be. The story suspended my disbelief in vampires and gave them a reasonable place in the plot. Read it."
5,awesome,"by the time youre actually interested in buying this album, you know what to expect. its one of their best. it rules"
4,Killer Songs With A Poor Production,"I'm a massive Metal church fan and will always consider this one of the classic metal releases along with their first one. But, unlike the first one, the production on this one, the sound, was not up to par. The songs themselves are killer, trademark Church, no doubt. However, the sound level was low, not as clear as the first, which makes you have to hit the bass boost on the your amp, and have the volume knob higher up the dial than most CD's. Killer songs though, not to be missed. Picks are: Ton of Bricks, The Dark, Psycho, Start The Fire, and of course, Watch The Children Pray. If you want to hear some of these songs loud beyond belief, with a clear production, pick up their live import on here, Metal Church Live. Cheers from Scraggy's Tomb!"
1,Not as smart as he thinks he is,"What a disappointment. This book is a jumbled mess of misogyny, narcissism, and bad writing. The detective is one of those arrogant jackasses who believes he's the smartest person in the room AND irresistible to women. Mr. Schweizer enjoys giving us lots of insider detail about church music and the Episcopal church (and most of those details he gets right) but he doesn't craft a very good mystery. The villain is a cartoon character who is loathsome from her first appearance (I kept hoping there would be some kind of interesting twist at the end, but Schweizer isn't that talented or imaginative)and supporting characters in the mystery are simply unbelievable. The detective ends up being judge, jury AND ecclesiastical court - nothing so mundane for him as actually building a case...I won't buy another one."
5,The Alto Wore Tweed LOVED IT!,"this book was SUPER I loved every page of it, was a cross between an agatha christie and a patrick mcManus. I laughed out loud more than once and when i finished it ran back to amazon and bought 6 more of the series. I can't wait to find out what he does next. for me this is a REALLY GOOD READ!! to the author: Bring them on, give us more, loved it so very much. Thank you for writing this book the laughter did me good!"
4,A very witty 'Who dun nit' ?,"Wow Robert Parker meets Dave Barry! This is a possibly one of the funniest police mystery novels I've ever read.......witty dialog, loveable characters and a really deceiving plot, that keeps you guessing `who dun nit' right up until the last few pages of the novel. Mark Schweizer has a wonderful sense of humor, but he can also spin a decent yarn!I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to read the other 7 novels in the series."
2,"Not really that good, already outdated","This book is not really that good. It's printed in tiny fonts and filled with sidebar BS so it's hard to read and keep track of what you read. The author rambles a lot and there's very little concrete information even though a lot of topics are covered in a cursory manner. Worst, this book is already way outdated, as ECNs and ATS's as well as industry consolidations plus the Grasso fiasco have changed industry landscape (and enriched many a capital pig who does not produce real products but reaps billions for stealing other people's money). Ok, I'm a financial analyst so i don't contribute anything to this society either, but I'm no capitalist pig, just a lowly employee."
3,pretty cool,"not a bad game, better played with a controller for me. the alien mission is kind of cool, wish the game was more free roaming, facehugging more than one available character but it had to follow the story so thats ok. voice acting ok. player options and abilities really cool, walking on the walls and ceiling really cool. all in all, a good game"
5,Good buy,"Took a couple days for it being ""expedited"", but I didn't need it before I got it, so no complaints."
4,Foul Play,"Pure Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase slapstick romantic comedy. If you like them, you'll love the movie."
4,Foul Play - still loads of fun,"The film Foul Play with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase from the 70s are still loads of fun , and still grips you right from the beginning untill the hilarious end. Goldie Hawn with her huge innocent eyes sparkles and the late Rachel Roberts creates a sinister character , Dudley Moore as the sex starved conductor , Stanley is outstanding. The car chase through San Francisco is hair raising . A definitive must have"
3,Miniature version of the screwdriver.,"I was looking for the full sized screwdriver. I have one that I love and wanted a replacement. Should have looked closer at the picture. This one is a miniature version with bits that would be used on your glasses. Nothing wrong with it, just was expecting the ""normal"" size screwdriver."
3,Good academic study but lacks spiritual discussion.,"The book is well researched and well written. As an academic book it is very good, however the author's discussion ignores the deep spiritual attachment that many members of the church have towards the temple, his book focuses on why members might not like the temple ceremony rather than why a vast majority draw strenght from temple worship. The list of books in the appendix that describe what goes on in the temple are mostly polemical works that mock, and denigrate things that are sacred to a large group of people."
1,Too Basic,This book is very basic and gives advice about how to manage money. However the one mistake the book makes is that it assumes that collection agencies and/or creditors are legitimate and offers no recourse to how to dispute charges from less scrupulous companies and agencies. The text for dealing with credit reporting bureaus is very basic. There are more precise texts to tell how to clean up your credit report (naturally after you have closed the accounts).
4,Good book...,"I liked this book but it didn't draw me in like the author's other books;The Debt and The Note. I know it was loosely based on the fairy tale characters from sleeping beauty but I just couldn't match it up. It is an interesting book though. I would recommend it to everyone.Semi-spoiler!Aurora Norquest has been bound all her life to a lie that she has believed. After the death of her mother, that lie starts to unravel and come to a touching end. It is a roller coaster ride until you get there, so buckle up and read!"
3,great book,Books came in good time and they are perfect for our little two year old grandson who is fascinated with these machines!
4,clamps,cheaper than local supply houses and are an exact oem fit i wont ever be caught with out a clamp again
3,Though the songs are great let me explain the 3 stars,"What they have done here is combined two Southside albums ""The Jukes"" and ""Why Is Love Such A Sacrifice"". Not a bad idea, especially since those are my two favorite Soutside albums, but they should have both been included in their entirety (double disc). You have some great cuts here: ""Sacrifice"", ""All I Want Is Everything"", ""It Hurts"", ""On The Beach"" and ""Restless Heart"", but what you're MISSING!!!!! ""Murder"", ""Love When It's Strong"", ""Long Distance"" and ""Why"" from Sacrifice and three masterpieces from ""The Jukes"": ""Wait In Vain"", ""Paris"" and ""The Time"" (not to mention the rocking ""Your Reply"" and ""Security"". Take it from me people--seek out the originals once you hear ""The Time"" you will wonder how such a song never propelled Southside to the stardom that he deserved."
4,What Bruce Could Have Been,"This old set of cuts from SSJ contains some classic cuts -- Everything is one of the best along with Living in the Real World. He emerged from the Jersey Shore about the same time as Springsteen but never got to the level Bruce did. This and some of his later works show where Springsteen could have gone, while Bruce's material shows where SSJ never did go. There are a couple of cuts on this CD that don't quite make it but those that do -- head and shoulders above anything else to come out of Jersey. Listen to it and remember what Rock 'n Roll was supposed to be."
4,online help,"I am glad to see they are finally coming up with a new starcraft game. I love playing this online but even with high speed internet I still see red pings for some people and there is still a whole lot of lag. I used to play the game with dial up when it first came out and had very little trouble. Sure there was red pings then too, but its been out for close to 10 yrs and the blizzard servers still have lag with me I even tried it at work where I have 3 times as much speed and it still has lag. but find the games where there is no red ping and you will be fine."
3,Nice and easy to understand,"I was writing a report about turbocharging a 294cc rotary engine. I used this book and found it easy to follow. But it lacks the maps for very small engines, other than 650cc for motorbikes."
5,Excellent turbo info.,"This book is a little dated, but still has lots of important information about turbo charging. Very informative and easy to read. Makes you want to turbo charge your car!"
4,Everything a beginner needs to know about turbos and more,"Very well presented, with good balance between theory and practice, a lot of photos and an easy to read style. The only MINUS of this book is that it says nothing about the turbo engine of the decade - the VW/Audi 1.8T motor. I would immediately buy a new edition, covering this topic."
5,If you want to build a turbo...,"...you can rely on this book like the really useful manual. Don't think you will have been answered about basic physical laws or rules - you had the time in school... This serious work from Mr. Bell was made for professionals, not for amateur. If you decided to install turbo system on your runabout or you are going to tune up your almost dead something eighties turbo car, it's for you. Merely you will know exactly what where when, and why so, in your engine occurs..."
5,School is in session and understanding available here,"I've owned and driven a turbo designed car for many years. I've read a number of articles here and there and had a number of conversations, all aimed at getting an understanding of how my car worked. This book really is a concise, yet thorough, explanation of a turbo-charged engine. A discussion of the competing dynamics that are at work and what one can do to influence those dynamics. The author has provided a ton of math, so the technically inclined can use the formulas and explanations to guide their own tuning. But the book is also practical in it's explanations, not just theoretical. I drive an older Saab and I came away from the book with a real appreciation for how much great science went into the design of my car."
5,Very useful and easy to understand.,"This book is very useful for the average enthusiast. I'm a mechanical engineer, so much of the technical discussion was easy for me to understand, however none of it was so complex that a non-technical person couldn't grasp it extremely quickly. Very helpful and useful for those attempting to understand turbochargers and their set up and installation. Before you get into any project, you have to understand the foundations and the big picture before you can understand the details. This is the perfect book to familiarize almost anyone with the overall design, installation, and function of turbochargers."
3,Ok but no increased mpg,"Purchased this filter to hopefully see an increase in gas mileage, so far no luck, actually my mpg went down a little bit. But will leave it in for a while to see if things change. I did notice a little more power."
1,Simple Solutions 11137 Training Pad Holder not a great buy,"I just purchased this for my Chihuahua puppy and the fasteners don't hold very tight leaving enough gap for little claw to dig out the edges of the pee pad and rip it to shreds. Because of the fact that the top needs to be disassembled and reassembled every time makes it a real hassle. I suggest spending the extra money on a better quality product. For this, you're getting less than what you paid for."
5,"Great knife, especially for the price","I've had this knife for a couple of years now. It was given to me by my dad. The blade holds an edge really well and the synthetic handle has held up perfectly. If you take care of this knife it will last forever. Case has excellent customer service as well, so you can't go wrong buying one of their products."
2,Kind of disappointing,"Ultra Dance 06 is a double-disc of the hottest dance tunes so you do get your money's worth in terms of length. However, this cd set does not live up to the other normally-good releases on Ultra records.I found this double-disc has too many songs that sound the same - too many female vocalists over upbeat mostly bland bouncy beats.The mixing wasn't the greatest either in between songs and that's not even something I normally notice. Basically, there was nothing really happening here for me.Also, there seems to be a lot overlap with the Ministry of Sound ""Annual 2005"" double-disc. I would say you would be better of picking that one up instead of this one."
2,Commercial dance music,"That's the best way to describe this double CD. Some of the tracks are actually pretty good, however the producers selected some rather poor mixes of them. There's no real progression or flow with mixes like these (they don't start off slowly and bulid their way up like a good DJ set would). Also, if you are into the club scene at all, you'll realize that many of these tracks are pretty old. If you want to listen to some true house music, check out This Is Everybody Too by Sander Kleinenberg or Subliminal Winter Sessions by Eric Morillo."
2,hard to work with,I bought this to get the correct cork and glue for my first attempt at replacing neck cork on a alto sax. after soaking the cork for over 30 min. in warm water the cork fit over the lip of the sax but while trying to cut away the very thick cork it split. there is one preformed piece of cork so you get one shot at getting it right.the cork is approx 1/4 in thick and the recommended thickness is 1/16. maybe a professional could get this to work with very sharp tools and a sanding disk but not worth it for a newbie.
1,wish it was more about the wrights,"Listened to part of this book on tape (did not read book). Quit after an hour because he talked about his own recent travel to WHERE the Wrights were born, buried etc. and not as much ABOUT the Wrights. His focus seemed more on his impression of places, and not enough details about the protagonists & why & how they experimented with flight. Had to stop when he described offering his tour guide a spoonful of his strawberry jam. Who cares about that? Tell the story of the Wright Bros!"
5,"Good price, good adapter bar",This adapter bar does just what it says. Holds the bike sturdy for a hitch mount rack. Price is just right. No complaints.
3,Good concept; needs better description / measurements,"Bought this to carry children's bicycles on our car hitch style bike rack; was just ""arranging"" the bikes on the rack to make them work but figured I would purchase this to add the ""center"" bar to make them hang and carry easier. Unfortunately, the bar does not shorten down enough to fit child's bicycles. The connectors are very easy to operate and latch down well but this is only useful for adult or large teen bike's that are missing the center bar."
3,Spare Hand Bike Adapter,This worked well with a two wheel bicycle but I was looking for one that might work with a tricycle for adults. Good product
3,The cost of doing business,"13is a movie about a man seizing an opportunity to take on a dead man's identity for the potential of a large payout. He didn't realize that the payout would include his life, IF he won; payout was at the conclusion of a deadly Russian Roulette tournament.Basically,13is about bored rich men using poor men for their amusement, with no regard for the poor men's feelings or lives. The poor men are worth about as much as plastic chess pawns. This is not a concept that I enjoy in life or in fiction.The acting wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Viewers seeking a great thriller shouldn't waste their time; however, if you're looking for a drama to kill an hour and a half of your time, ""13"" isn't a bad way to go."
3,B-MOVIE NOIR ON STEROIDS -- BUT NOT AS INTENSE AS THE ORIGINAL,"A desperate handyman steals an envelope containing information about a mysterious job that could pay a fortune. Under a false identity, he finds himself as a participant in an underworld Russian roulette tournament where bettors gamble on who will survive. With the highest stakes imaginable - both good and bad -- and the belief that his odds are as good as anyone's, he plays this most deadly game. A great cast, Jason Statham, Sam Riley, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Ray Winstone, Alexander Skarsgard, Mickey Rourke, inhabits this B noir on steroids.See if you can find the original if this remake works for you. It's even more intense."
1,Terrible Movie,"A slow, boring movie with a terrible ending. It has some quality actors and an intriguing premise. But the ending is a make you feel bad ending and at the end of the movie, I felt like I wasted my money. I pay for movies to be entertaining, and this was not. Just terrible."
1,WASTE OF TIME,Absolutely a waste of money. 80% of the movie takes place in one scene. The beginning is alright and it quickly goes down hill.
3,Entertaining diversion,"While this movie won't garner any Oscars, I did find it to be a welcome diversion. It's the American version of ""13 Tzamati"" (which I have not seen) and centers around three participants at a Russian roulette competition at a secret location on a Pennsylvania estate. Two of these men--played by Sam Riley and Mickey Rourke--have no idea what they're getting into while the third (Ray Winstone) is a favored champion in the competition. Although the principal players exhibit solid acting, some of the supporting cast members (Michael Shannon) do not. Alexander Skarsgard, Jason Statham and David Zayas, however, offer up quality supporting roles. Ben Gazzara was barely recognizable (since he's super old now). The movie's ending didn't satisfy me, but then maybe that's a good thing. Worth a look. Keep your expectations low going in and you might just come away pleased."
1,wasn't worth it.,The movie was actually so slow and bad that I only watched maybe 5-10 minutes of it. I was actually mad at myself for wasting my $3.99! I guess my review is not really a review of the movie since I didn't watch it! Sad.
2,Shallow plot,This movie just didn't grab me. I thought the plot was interesting enough but it just didn't flow well or leave me wondering what would happen next. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend or want to watch it again.
1,"If I could select zero stars, I would.","This guitar is awful. It looks pretty, but the tuning knobs don't work at all, and the guitar can't be played -- crappy, even as a child's toy. I've seen better quality pieces in the international markets in Mexico City, and that's not saying much. At least those guitars were priced appropriately. This item isn't worth one dollar. It's a complete piece of crap. Also, the vendor doesn't care about the product or the condition in which it arrives. Basically, he told me - albeit politely - to ship it back and email the tracking number so they can locate it in their ""giant warehouse."" Otherwise, they won't have a clue about it's location. Not a word about the condition of the broken guitar, and no apology for the piss-poor quality of this item. AWFUL! I posted pictures of the strings that can never be tightened. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1,Terrible Product and Seller,i bought this as a present for my daughter. we both were very excited when it arrived but when we took it out of the box it was defected and broken. the strings were all lose and when you try to tighten them the plastic pieces dont hold in place so the second you try to play the strings all slip. i tried contacting the seller a few times and to this day i have not gotten a response. i am very unhappy and this is my first bad experience with any seller on amazon. do not buy this product from this seller it is better to throw your money down the drain. this seller does not respond to emails.
1,Drivers for XP,XP doesn't recognize it. And no support on finding drivers to make it work. Money wasted for nothing
1,FAKE Documentary- waste of time,"I rented this thinking it was a real documentary. Cover box and synopis misleading. 5 minutes in, it was obvious. The actors are horrible sterotyping rural southerners. Phony accents and scripted dialouge comes through plenty. I guess this film is trying to go for a ""Blair Witch"" faux realism but it doesn't work. It is laughable attempt to create a ""reality gone mad"" fakeumentary."
5,Old Dirty,"These fellas are hot, they are a cool hip hop group from my hood, and keep an ear out for that boy Old Dirty he's chainless. SC"
4,"Learning Your A's, B's and Cure","This is a great start for someone looking to get into the early Cure. You can't get any better than this...right? Well actually you can, the cassette tape had all the A-sides mentioned (17 songs), but also had just as many B-sides jammed into that little bad boy. All the songs on this cassette version are now released on the ""Connect the Dots"" box set. I only gave this 4 stars because the cassette version is worth a fiver. Enjoy!!!"
4,tire inflator,Works well at filling and deflating. Seems well made and a good product for the garage mechanic. the gauge is accurate for normal tire pressures.
1,Tire Inflator not what they say it is.,I purchased this thinking it was a 0 to 100 Psi which is what is advertised but what arrived is a 0 to 160 Psi which is worthless for checking lower tire pressures. Not worth the effort sending back maybe I can covert to a blow gun. One must remember you get what you pay for.
1,WARNING - Does not work for PSI over 100,"This Tire Gauge has a warning on it not to use to inflate over 100 PSI. The product information stating ""Gauge has range of 10-140 psi"" is incorrect and misleading. DO NOT ORDER FOR RV USE!!!"
5,"Good, inflator. Could have been great with different chuck!","Good size, fits my hand well, gauge is east to read and goes to 140psi. I threw the chuck away and bought a dual head air chuck."
1,Does Not Match Any Normal Compresser Fittings,"After spending the greater part of the day going to several parts stores in order to find a matching connector so I could use it with any of my 3 compressors, I finally had to purchase one at a store that cost 2 times as much."
5,worked very good,"clip on worked very good. guage was spot on accurate, the guage went up to 250#s not that any tire can hold that. Really helps out a one legged guy fill his tires."
5,Buy a gauge when you purchase this item.,"I have seen these in operation before I made the purchase. I knew the provided gauge was a pos, so i ordered a 0-60, 1/4"" npt Interstate gauge ($5.99) at the same time. (I just want to fill and check golf carts and passenger cars so the included 0-160 was too hard to read as the needle never advanced beyond the first quarter of the dial). If I had young eyes, it may have been ok, but I don't. Next, i quickly unscrewed the old gauge, popped off the nice rubber guard and replaced the new meter w/ guard on the inflater. Voila! I have a tool that works great. My working range is mostly in the middle of the gauge range with bright well-spaced numbers. If I ever buy a semi or a blimp, I will put the old gauge back on. I give it 5* after mod, 3* out of the box. Here is the link for the new gauge.Interstate Pneumatics G2012-060 2 Inch 60 PSI - 1/4 Inch NPT Bottom Mount Pressure Gauge"
2,As advertised,"I felt the item was incomplete since it did not have a connection that could be hooked up to my compressor. I had to go out and buy a separate fitting to connect it. However that was not the fault of the item. It just came that way. Other than that, I am satisfied."
3,my thoughts on tire gauge,I like the idea of a built in tire gauge but the air flow is to slow for my likeings
4,Small wood Gerber,"Arrived on time.Came out of the box sharp.Comes with belt-loop sheath; sheath has a hard plastic insert, so blade doesn't cut it up.Smallish size fits my hand nicely.Wood handle is bottum chubby; easy enough to sand it down if you don't like it I guess...This knife looks real slick and feels great!Good buy"
4,For elementary students,"The CD is good, but I teach high school and half the songs are too boring for older students, because it repeats the steps frequently and older students need more of a challenge from beginning to end. It is perfect for elementary school from Kinder to grade 6maybe."
2,Partial purring,"2 1/2If I've said it once, I've said it thirty six times; bloated bombast and pompous production sinks most of the moving (instrumental) segments into being just another off-broadway, neo-prog delusion."
3,Not for tropical areas.,"Didn't work when my friends and I were traveling in Southeast Asia. It's possible that the mosquitoes there are tougher...Edit: Changed my 1-star review to 3 stars, because this thing worked pretty well in repelling a potential ant invasion into my apartment."
4,Simple Pleasures,"The strength of this album is in the lyrics. Marcus Joseph is a poet. His lyrics are touching, simple, and timeless, and the words cut to the heart of the matter. His phrasing is exquisite, and the melodies unusual. Some of the songs are a bit 'over-produced' as was the style back then, but I find myself listening to the sweeter songs again and again. They have a universal theme, and if you like the music of Steven Bishop, England Dan & John Ford Coley, or Seals & Crofts, you will enjoy Marcus Joseph's album."
2,Unstable,"This looked like the ultimate luxury accessory for my hammock. Unfortunately, it just does not stay balanced and tips your drink at angles severe enough to regularly spill it. I must have tried attaching this to six different locations on the hammock and rigging the hanging rope ten different ways to stabilize it. It needs a third hanging rope, some kind of dead weight, or other innovation to make it work. You're better off just putting a tiny side table by the hammock."
3,Lobsta Gangs,"This book was very pedantic but interesting. It's essentially an ""academic read"" [sociology], but contains enough ""nuggets"" of insight into life in Maine lobstering communities to be of interest to the curious reader BUT it isn't particularly ""entertaining""."
2,Nice swivel screen,"That's the good part. You can rotate it in any direction, which means you can view it in a variety of situations. Let's see - oh yeah, the sound on the player is nice.Now the bad part? The LCD screen died after 1 year, and they wanted as much to fix it as the cost of a new player.Not worth buying for 1 year of ownership - and I really took care of it."
1,A complete....,This is not an Exchange 5.5 manual. Most of the book is written for v. 4.0 and 5.0 of Exchange. The authors merely added a few paragraphs about what has been added for version 5.5 but offer no information that any administrator could find useful. Passing this book off as a 5.5 manual is an insult. Save your money.
1,Was shorted an issue in 2011 and won't renew,"The November 2011/Fall 2011 double issue was a scam that wasn't fair to customers. The magazine is okay, but not great and the last straw for me was the ""double"" issue without notice or warning or approval from me when I paid for a certain number of issues. I'll never subscribe again."
2,"THIS IS AVERAGE, REALLY AVERAGE","SO I FINALLY GOT ROUND TO LISTENING TO THIS '''SO CALLED CLASSIC ALBUM''' AND I HAVE TO SAY WHOA! MAN! THIS IS AVERAGE!! OH MY GOD!! WHAT A BAD CHOICE!! I MEAN I HAD TWO ALBUMS IN MY HANDS, THIS AVERAGE MAUVE COVERED TRASH AND THE GREAT LINKIN PARK, MAYBE THIS WAS EXCITING FOR PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN THE 70S OR WHATEVER THEN SURE I CAN SEE THE APPEAL, BUT FOR MY GENERATION THE TRAILBLAAZIN' LIMP BIZKIT SET STANDARDS THAT CAN NEVER BE SURPASSED BY MEDIOCRE STUFF LIKE THIS. I MEAN CHECK THE RIFFS, SERIOUSLY THOUGH, THE SOLOS, WEAK! THE VOCALS, TOO FEMININE... SERIOUSLY THOUGH, SERIOUSLY I LOVE ROCK, IM A ROCK HEAD, BUT YOU METALLICA FANS NEED TO 'GET WITH IT', GET WITH THE 20TH CENTURY MAN, WHERE CRAZY STUFF IS HAPPENING, 'ALL DAY, EVERY DAY'SERIOUSLY THOUGH THIS IS AN 'AVERAGE' EFFORT, SOMETHING THAT IS FINE FOR THE EVERY DAY 'JOE SOAP' BUT NOT FOR ME. THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER."
2,overrated,The lack of original guitarist Dave Mustaines blazing riffs is appearent on this album. However it has it's moments and is enjoyable the first 10 listens or so.
5,The Golden Age,"I would give anything to go back in time to 1986. Reign in Blood was kicking the world's ass, Megadeth was Selling Peace, and prog shred just started to hit the air waves. More importantly, Master of Puppets was released and it defined Metallica. It was their climax, their epic, their swan song. From the fires of Battery, to the onslaught of Disposable Heroes, to the majesty of Orion, to The Thing That Should Not Be, the album defys the mortal coil of metal and proclaims itself god. Though Slayer is the king of my metal empire, Master of Puppets is incredibly significant, with only the spitefully fast fury that is Damage Inc. holding them back from perfection. Obey your Master."
1,Metallica sucked then and sucks now!,"The songs were long and repetitive the riff for Master of the Puppets sounds like the cd got scratched and skipped. Don't listen to this sh** or extremly gay Iron Maiden listen to good 80s metal like GNR Motley Crue Def Leppard Van Halen. Yeah theyre more poppy but they actually made good music. The only decent hardcore bands are Ozzie Osbourne/Black Sabbath, Pantera and Nirvana. Ill tell you metallica fans this as much as I hate metallica, Iron maiden makes metallica look good"
1,Utter Nonsense,"This so-called ""great"" album is extremely overrated. Overly-long, droning songs, ridiculous lyrics, neanderthal-like grunting from the singer...is this music? Try Load or Re-load to hear how a metal band should sound."
5,"Best album in the history of all music, not just metal.","Battery: Thrash insanity;good way to open up the album. One of my personal faves.Master of Puppets: An epic! Awesome riffs, solos and lyrics. A tad lengthy but hey: It still rulesThe Thing that Should Not Be: My least favorite on the album, but still a great song. Kind of has that sludgy old-school Sabbath feel.Welcome Home(Sanitarium): A great ballad. Changes things up a bit. One of my all time favorite 'Tallica songs.Disposable Heroes: Same as 'Puppets. A little lengthy but still great.Leper Messiah: Slows things up a bit but retains it's heaviness. A taste of the years to come.Orion: Metallica's best instrumental ever. And that's aying something.Damage,Inc.: Heaviest on the album( or any other Metallica album for that matter) and one of the best.Great way to close it.Puppets is by far the best album of all time. If you don't like it, you cannot call yourself a metal fan. METALLICA!!!"
1,Great Album...Terrible Vinyl Edition,"I purchased the Vinyl edition of this album about a month ago. I was excited to listen to ""Orion"" only to be disappointed by constant hisses and pops from a BRAND NEW Vinyl. One track wouldn't even play all the way through it would reach a certain point and skip over and over again.I thought I might have gotten a bad disk so I returned it. The second disk had exactly the same problems. I've bought 20 year old vinyls that sounded better.I think this is just a really cheap pressing. I've noticed that the best vinyls tend to advertise they have a high grain (180). This vinyl seems really thin and cheap. Maybe that is why it is so messed up.I'm giving the vinyl edition 1 star. Its a 5 star album though."
5,"Best Metallica - wait, no - best metal album of all time","This is by far the best Metallica album and best heavy metal album of all time. It breaks the rules of 80's American metal being nothing but noise, mixing good rock rhythm with high decibal speed. It also displays Metallica frontman James Hetfield's incredible talent for strong and meaningful lyrics. In a decade when most rock bands incouraged drug use, Metallica sings of the horrors of cocaine addiction in the track, ""Master of Puppets."" also the aloneness and depression of the mentally ill in ""Welcome Home (Sanatirium.) This is not an alubum for just hearing a bunch of noise, this is the album for the intelectual metal fan..."
1,Boy are these lyrics bad,"I rather listen to songs about dragons(dio), satan(mercyful fate), historic battles(iron maiden), pirates(running wild) or leather then some drunk 6th grade education 22 year old pi$$ and moan about real life subjects like james does, that is what nirvana is for. kurt cobain might have been annoying at times, but he had 1000 times the talent of james hetfeild,hell,all of metallica combind."
5,Sound quality is the best.,"A must have. Even if you already have Puppets, you still gotta have this one. Sound quality is excellent. The 24k gold c.d. is also very cool. ANd the glossy finish on the booklet is awesome. 5 Star"
2,DEFECTS IN VINYL FROM NEW Manufacturing Problem,"When I purchased this item I was really looking forward to hearing some good Metallica in awesome sound quality, because hearing something on a brand new vinyl is like hearing it for the first time but I was extremely disappointed because right from the start the record would skip, I believe this to be a manufacturing error and not one of shipping or mishandling. I did not try to return it due to my schedule."
5,METALLICA'S BEST ALBUM... EVER!!!,"Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" is their best album. I mean, everything was great. The band still had Cliff Burton, who had an amazing talent of reading notes, and this is thrash metal at its best. Better then most bands put out today. This is my second review of ""Master of Puppets"", this time rating them with a 10/10 score:1. Battery 9.5/102. Master of Puppets 10/10 THEIR BEST SONG... EVER!!!3. The Thing That Should Not Be 10/104. Welcome Home(Sanitarium) 10/105. Disposable Heroes 10/106. Leper Messiah 9.9/107. Orion (Instrumental) 9.5/108. Damage, Inc. 9.5/10Overall: A+ (98.0%)= 5 STARS!!!"
2,Battery and Orion are all you need to listen to.,"I'll say yes, because this atleast has about 2 good songs in Battery and Orion. Listen to those. Battery makes me laugh."
2,Good news for people who like crappy music,"What was good once usually becomes outdated after time. Such is the deal with Metallica. This album was good back then but now it's crap. It's just riff after riff. And whats more many people these days can play this stuff. If it was truly art, )which it is only considered by non-musicians and crappy musicians) then then it would be difficult. So as you all know Metallica are now sellouts and are fading from the metal scene. Good Riddance:) New bands like Blind Guardian (The gods of metal) simply put Metallica to shame. Its harder to play, Lyrics are more indepth, Drumming is 10x better. All of the people in Blind Guardian are 10x better then James, Kirk, Lars and which ever bassist you choose. There is really no comparison. And I know about real metal music and since you consider metallica to be the best, you obviously don't. So you should stay away from Blind Guardian because you don't deserve to listen to it."
1,Heavy Over Rated,"Heavily over Rated!!! If there is one Band that is over rated Metallica is it... The sounds never changes... While James is fantastic, his sound remains the same... He needs a fresh break! Where is the rest of the bands in put? Maybe they are still counting their money, from being selling out... to the commercial masses."
5,Master of Puppets,Killer disk. Had when I was a teenager. Have had to re-add to my collection. Grew up on them. They were a local band for me.
1,There's nothing metal about metallica.,"I never liked this album. It was garbage in my opinion. You guys can bash me all you want, but i dont care, THIS ALBUM SUCKED."
2,I HAVE AN EXPLANATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok every fan of Matallica I meet theyre all like one big cult(I'm probably wrong)but dont you think this band is just a little overratted! Dont get me wrong theyre awsome theyre METAL GODS!!!!The album is awsome but all I'm syin is that theyre not theeee best!BUT THEYRE AWSOME(..)
3,"Not bad, but overrated.","Metallica at this point was not a bad band, although they sold out later and sucked. The first song ""Battery"" is very good, I like it a lot, it and the second song ""Master of Puppets"" are my favorites on the album. The rest is not bad, but it is certainly overrated. Also, this album's influence is overrated as well I believe. THe members of Metallica complain about Napster, yet their success came baecause they STOLE music from Dave Mustaine, who started Megadeth, a better band you should check out. Get Killing is My Business... and Business is Good remastered, and Peace Sells but whos buying and anything else. Also check out testament, get their rerecorded best of First Strike still deadly and THe New order. Also, Iron Maiden is great and deserves a lot of credit, they get it fortunately unlike megadeth. Also if u like thrash metal and insane solos check out two great bands Children of Bodom and Kalmah."
5,The Best of Metallica,"If you had to pick the best Metallica album of all time, Master of puppets is it. This is a fast paced, thrashing album that any rock fan will love. The title song will blow you away with it's solos and wild guitar. Sanitarium inspires the true sense of rebellion that everyone feels. Disposable Heroes brings home a heavy point about the military today and what might come in the future. Orion takes you on a hard rock journey through space, and Damage Inc. is just flat out awesome! I give this 5 stars and recommend it to both newcomers and veterans of the hard rock genre."
5,Master of Puppets is very good.,"Well I would have to say that Metallica's Master of Puppet CD is the best after Ride The Lightning and before And Justice For All. Most of the songs are great with great classic intros like ""Battery"",""Master Of Puppets"", and ""Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"". Metallica is for people with good taste and Rolling Stones is for people with poor taste. Highly recommended."
5,Remember the good old days?,"Ah, the good old days. The summer of '86, cruising the strip with Damage, Inc. blasting at top volume...sniffle.... And now, everything's all gone to garbage. We've all grown up since those days, and I guess, unfortunately, Metallica has too. But at least we have the first three albums (of which Master is the best) to remind us of how things used to be. If you're one of these little kids running around with a sock on your head and claiming that Load and Reload rock, then you really owe it to yourself to listen to this album. You should hear what they sounded like when they REALLY rocked. Back in the good old days..."
1,You know you're a poser when...,"You know you're a poser when you think Metallica sold out sometime AFTER Master of Puppets.This is the Metallica sell-out album. Unless Garbage Days came out before??I forgot when I moved on to bands like Nuclear Death, A.C. Meat S**ts, Nasty Savage, etc.A lot of bands have self-destructed selling out but Metallica is a true sellout success story. I can't blame them. They are wealthy beyond belief now.I am not going to waste my money listening to this pop garbage though."
5,"Some hard-driving, intense stuff here","What can I say? This is one of those albums that is perfect to blast from the stereo during long-distance, late night drives. The usual S.F. themes in the lyrics abound: ""Spirit of the Age"" is about a future society of clones; ""Damnation Alley"" about a city-to-city courier in a post-nuclear war world. The title track can best be described as a love song for nerds. ""Hassan I Sahba"" tops them all: A hard rock song with Middle Eastern overtones, sung in Arabic. The musical style here is about five years ahead of it's time (this album was originally released in 1978) and groups like A Flock of Seagulls, and _Signals_-era Rush, owe a great deal influence-wise to this album. It rocks harder than either of those, however. If you're not already a Hawkwind believer this album will make you one."
2,WEAKEST OF THE SET,"I have purchased the whole set (seven) to complete it, this one by far I found to be the weakest. The artists are not the best either, from start to finish the series is excellent. Except Vol.four & and this one, it was a good live series all recorded at a club in Louisiana, it is a bunch of artists who were all on the (Blacktop) label at the time. I think the whole set is great except these two I mentioned, I would not rate any of them below four stars except these two. (see my other review on the rest of the set)"
5,Elaine,You have made my day!!!! I have also been searching for this CD/MP3. I bought this album a second time in the 1980s because I was wearing the first one out. This is one of my all time favorites!!!!! Thank you for making it available!!!
4,one little omission,"I agree totally with the ""lonereviewer"" except for one other piece of trivia and that is ""you got me running"" was covered very nicely by gene cotton and a hit also."
3,hard rock with an edge thanks to great guitar playing,"Probably the best of the dokken albums though I'd also recommend the following album ""back for the attack"" both have probably a good half dozen songs each that are prime examples of what this band were all about when they were at their best. On this album you get the heavier side of dokken for tracks like ""lighnin strikes again"" & ""til the livin end"" which are a little bit formulaic but are saved by the guitar playing of George Lynch, one of the most underappreciated guitar players in metal circles, the tracks to really look out for though are ones like ""in my dreams"", ""its not love"" (my personal fav!), ""jaded heart"" & ""will the sun rise"" where glorious power chords abound along with great solos & vocal hooks to drag you in. Probably just too heavy to really make the band megastars."
3,Complain about misleading product description,"The description of this Dokken CD, provided by Amazon, is misleading, as it refers to a Japanese edition, not to the product you are looking at. The disclamer about product description referring to a Japanese print CD was not always there, it appeared (supposedly after similair complains) after I have ordered this CD. If I'd known that it is not a Japanese edition, I would rather look for a remastered edition of this album. I have to admit that recording quality is OK, however I would rahter know what I am buying beforehand. This all seems to be a simple database fault, but leaves unpleasant impression about the Amazon service that overall I rate as one of the best globally."
5,Arguably Dokken's best,"After the Melodic Metal debut album, Breaking The Chains, and the much heavier follow up, Tooth And Nail, Dokken found a middle ground on Under Lock And Key. Under Lock And Key features several of Dokken's best songs, including ""In My Dreams,"" ""It's Not Love,"" ""Unchain The Night,"" and ""The Hunter."" ULAK also features the rip roaring ""Lightning Strikes Again,"" one of their best ""fast and heavy"" songs, and ""Slippin' Away,"" the follow up to ""Alone Again"" from Tooth And Nail. ""Slippin' Away"" is actually almost as good as ""Alone Again."" The production on ULAK is excellent, with a GREAT guitar tone and a great mix. For a combination of power and melody with some great hooks you can't find anything better than Under Lock And Key. As good? Maybe. But not better. -(And if you like this one, check out Alice Cooper's Hey Stoopid CD, KISS' Asylum CD, and Ratt's Dancing Undercover CD.)"
5,Dokken at its best! This CD Rocks! Plain And Simple!,"This CD is 5 star all the way. This is a feel good all around rockin CD, This CD rocks top to bottom never a dull spot. Listen to my personal fav its not love these guys can rock. Some more of my favs are Jaded Heart, Unchain The Night, The Hunter. But the rest of the cd is awsome to Definatly there best work but i also recommend there other CD's released before 1988 after that they just didn't rock like they once did. Five stars all the way this Cd has been with me during good times, bad times and in between a must for any headbanger, or any hair band metal lover."
4,Not a hardcore reggae listener,"But I do listen to reggae. Mainly to artists like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Steel Pulse. I enjoy this album very much. I especially enjoyed Save Black Music, Not King James Version and Babylon the Bandit. Steel Pulse brings the heat, whether the sound is traditional reggae music or not, I haven't a clue. But I do know these songs are inspiring and the rest of the album is good enough to warrant a sale.Even ""Love Walks Out"" was a nice duet with an american artist (Gwen Guthrie I think). The only song I had little use for was ""School Boy Crush""."
4,"I am a huge Buffy fan, and this book was incredible!!","I am a huge fan of Buffy, The Vampire Slayer and I have to tell you that the novelization of the episodes from the show are awesome. I never actually saw the first episodes until after I read the books and all of them are great. I recommend it for anyone, it is a fun book you will not be able to put down."
1,NDE AUTHORS CASH IN ON INSECURE PEOPLE,NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES ARE FAKE!!!!I WAS CLINICALLY DEAD FOR 6 AND A HALF MINUTES. DURING THAT TIME I SAW NOTHING. AFTER DEATH YOU CEASE TO EXIST. NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE STORIES ARE MADE UP SO AUTHORS CAN MAKE MONEY ON PEOPLES FEAR OF DEATH. DONT SUPPORT THESE CON ARTISTS.
1,Not so hot,"The only valuable (and non-redundant; i.e., not out there on the net) information I obtained from this book was the difference between an ""active"" and ""easygoing"" and a ""shy"" toddler. Did not give me any insight into what to do now that my 20 month old is throwing tantrums, screeching (sometimes with joy, sometimes with anger), what to do about ""flinging food"", ""fighting getting into the car seat"", fighting getting his diaper changed ... - in other words - nothing about how I might guide his behavior. I am still looking for a good parenting book that really tells it like it is."
5,A real life saver,"Nothing is worse than forcing bad-tasting pills down a sick dog! These ""pill pockets"" are wonderful, they are soft like a chewy brownie so they really stick to the pill, but don't stick to your fingers. They can be easily reshaped so one pocket can be used for multiple doses. My dog loves them and anything I can do to make her happy at this point is a blessing!"
4,Great but for one thing,just to make sure that wants to see winter comes you take it down because it will dry rot. my husband hooked up with the hammock in april and he in my daughter both fell to the ground because it snapped right in half.
1,Great product BUT!,"This is only my second review, but I had to write as this product is great, BUT has a fatal flaw. Replace the S hooks immediately (before hammock use) with carabiners. If two people are in the hammock and one gets up to leave then the S hook can easily pop out of the ring and the hammock falls to the ground. That happened to me when my husband got up and I hit the ground hard. NO fun and easily fixed with closed carabiners. The product is great otherwise, but you really have to figure out how to set it up -- sort of a geometry problem, but doable."
5,MUST HAVE,"The straps are a MUST HAVE for your hammock! 5 star review, sets up in minutes, does not harm tree!"
2,Disappointing.,"I read the above recommendations, and believed what I read. But when I actually watched the DVD I was very disappointed with the image quality. To my eyes, it was not in HD and was a bit fuzzy. I also found it a little boring. The one sections I did really like were the Canyon chapters."
4,"Wow! How this band never made it, I'll never know","I just recently discovered this one album band from the late 1960's. Originally released on EMI's Harvest label in 1969, some of Bakerloo's label mates were Pink Floyd, The Move, Deep Purple, Pete Brown and Piblokto! and Roy Harper The album rocks out hard. The band was only together to record this one album and then disbanded to eventually work with others. It definitley echoes Cream and Led Zeppelin in their harder, bluesier moments."
4,Great product,"Perfect for winter grilling. Heats evenly and fits a 12"" lid if need be. Nonstick and FAR easier to clean than cast iron. I wish the ridges were a bit narrower like a real grill, but that is a very small complaint. I can finally get rid of my heavy cast iron grill pan! HOORAY!!"
4,Myths be gone !,John L. Allen brings his level headed and thorough reporting skills to bear on this book about Opus Dei. Those who demonize the group or overstate its goals and practices will find this book to be a necessary corrective.
1,Horrible,"Do not waste your time and money on this one. Not even worth hanging from your rear-view mirror. The first ablum shook my world, this one shook my faith in Otten"
1,"Green meadows, bubbling brooks, where?","Sure, anybody can do this. It did not take much creativity to go down to a real stream and tape it. So what's new up or down out there in that meadow you are in? Hey get with it it is 1999 and Y2K ready!!"
1,This is the worst,"As famed music critic Will friedwald says in his book ""jazz singing"", linda Ronstadt is not professional enough to sings standards, and as Firedwald also mentions even though she hired Nelson Riddle, his great arrangemts make her sound even more ametuerish. Even Plas Johnson's dreamy sax solos cant make her sound good. Too bad, what a waste!"
4,For fans,"The thing about Linda Ronstadt's three albums in which she collaborated with Nelson Riddle is, you either love them or you hate them. Count me as one of the people who enjoys it. I wouldn't say it's essential Linda Ronstadt by any means, if you are a big fan I think it suits you better, but it's a nice listen. I think she handles the songs with grace and her voice is just fine for what it calls for. So you have all three albums on this two disc set. Personally, I think the first album (tracks 1-9, WHATS NEW) is the best of the three, but there's good moments throughout all 32 tracks."
3,Problems with the DVDs,"I had to return this DVD pkg twice. There was a humming noise in the first DVD pkg through the first 15 minutes. I returned it. After I received the 2nd pkg, there was still a humming noise in the beginning 5 minutes and it was OK afterward. Yet, the second Special Features DVD that came with it did not play at all. It froze. My DVD player is fine. Everything else plays great. I will purchase The September Issue someplace else, since I had problems with the first two returns."
3,Documentary style,"I imagined this DVD to be a feature film, however it was more documentary style. Important for people in fashion"
1,Sorry I didn't visit this review site first,"Purchased two copies of the book based on the testimonials by the various book reviewers. I had planned to give one as a gift and keep the other for myself. I now have two books I don't think I'll even donate to the used book sale because the story is nothing like what you are led to believe it will be and, in fact, is anything but ""an intense and affecting journey of faith, miracle and humanity."" . I am thoroughly disappointed and disgusted with myself for wasting the money."
2,Not Likely,"Having lived in the Pacific Northwest a life time and in the church a life time, the main problem with this book is that it stretches belief. A Marian sighting in a Pacific Northwest logging town is surely possible, but it would generate a response of about ten people. Lots of good description of places and some of people. However, this isn't Rosswell, New Mexico people here in the Northwest aren't that gullable."
1,Still waiting for the point of it all...,"Snow Falling on Cedars in one of my favorite books. Even the movie was great. I read East of the Mountains with the expectation of enjoying it just as much. Boring. So I thought I'd give Guterson another try with Our Lady of the Forest. Even more boring. The most redeeming part of this book is that Anne sees the apparition at the very beginning of the book, on page 10. The rest of the book I kept on reading, waiting, hoping for something to happen, but nothing ever did. Ok, I'll admit it was mildly interesting to ponder how faith moves people in profound ways. But other than that, I think I'm done with Guterson. Or maybe I'll just read Snow Falling on Cedars again."
1,Disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed in this book and felt it was definitely written by an anti-Catholic. There was nothing uplifting whatsoever. I felt it was just another slam against the church and would not recommend it to anyone.Especially after loving Snow Falling on Cedars, this was a big letdown."
1,Guterson's fall,"An utter disappointment. Guterson falls way short of the bar he set for himself in Snow Falling on Cedars, which was the best book I've ever read. I feel like I've been raped in the same way Mark raped Ann."
2,A Disappointment,"I was delighted to find this book in my local library after enjoying Snow Falling on Cedars so very much a few years ago. Delight quickly turned to disappointment. Guterson's main characters are all obsessed with sex - Ann masterbates, she's been sexually abused in her past; Tom Cook thinks constantly about raunchy sex and imagines himself doing it with every woman he runs across; the priest masterbates and thinks about sex and the woman that ""befriends"" Ann (really uses her) is worried about men being attracted to her. I felt like Guterson was having some sort of mid life crisis, couldn't stop thinking about sex and had to write a book about it. It totally overwhelmed what could have been a very interesting and imaginative story. The ending was a disappointment as well - not what I had hoped or expected. I hope Mr. Guterson's got another good book in him somewhere - this sure isn't it."
2,Our Writer of Disappointments,"The character development in this book is absurd. Ann is mentioned all over the place in the context of the dialog of others, but has such little development that in the end, she barely matters. The priests are stereotypes, and terrible ones at that. Many parts of this story could have been cut and were absolutely boring. I am so disappointed in this book and the overall story. I'm angry at how negatively G. characterizes people, society, (not that I want a happy go-lucky book, but G. is just obnoxious, self-serving, and elitist) and the faithful. The quirks of Carolyn are idiotic and not humorous. The only one you end up feeling something for is Tom Cross (albeit mildly in that Hallmark Channel ending way). This book could have been so much more. G. has proven himself as a smart and talented writer. Too bad this book got in the way."
2,Intriguing Story Drenched by Explicit and Graphic Sadness,"If you're looking for another ""Snow Falling on Cedars,"" this isn't it. Guterson certainly has a gift for storytelling and painting characters with vivid descriptions and voices. But be forewarned - The language is gut-wrenchingly foul and the horribly brutal and graphic descriptions of both consensual sex and rape are so explicit that they overpower the story. ... The story of the homeless Ann Holmes being visited by the Virgin Mary is beautiful in its simplicity, including the crowd of both cynics and followers that surround her. However, Guterson seems so determined to develop dark, flawed characters with few redeeming qualities that you're left wondering why he bothered to embark on this journey. This is a sad story that leaves you not with a feeling of hopefulness, but rather despair at the cynicism that abounds in Guterson's world."
4,underrated band,"another underrated 80's band, still playing but unfortunately they're best singer just passed away (David Wayne) so its without him.Great cd here,recommended listening"
2,Classic metal... but...,"I'm not really thinking it's their best work. It falls a little flat from time to time, and is a little lacking in originality."
2,fiesta coffee mugs,the coffee mugs were fiesta ware cup in the correct color but the picture shown has a large opening in the handle the product i recevied has the small opening. the cups are not as pictured. so beware!!!mj
3,Good and Bad,"I was dissapointed when I picked Lyricist Lounge 2 up. First The track that I wanted was not there Rza/Last Emperor song. Also this was a little too mainstreem for me. The first Lounge had ill MC's on it that were underground and hungry. This one had mainstreem rappers like J.T. Money, Pastoy Troy, Redman, Bennie Seigel, Q tip and Macy Gray who is R&B. Their are bangers on the album like, ""Oh no"" with Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Monch. ""Ms. Fat Booty 2"", with Mos Def and Ghostface. ""Sharp Shooters"", with Talib Kweli and Dead Prez. ""Legendary Street Team"", with Kool G Rap and M.O.P. ""The Grimmy Way"", with Big Noyd and Prodigy. ""The Interlude with ill underground MC's kicking tight verses, and ""Right and Exact"" with Dilated Peoples. Besides that the rest of the album is Garbage. Lyricist Lounge 1 is a whole lot better then LL2."
1,did not fit my truck,Product ripped when i tried to put onto my Ford expedition..it was too small..Does not fit Trucks. I was totally dissapointed
1,This product STINKS!,"No, really! It smells so bad, that I have kept it out on my porch for over two weeks now, hoping the smell would go away so that I can put it in my car. But to no avail.I will be returning it, because there is NO WAY I can install it in my car with that awful smell.I really don't understand what causes it, but nothing seems to get rid of it. My sister used 2 bottles of Fabreeze on hers, and even that didn't work, so she sent hers back as well.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Work well,"Filters work well, this size is impossible to find locally, glad that there are decent filters you can get for this size instead of having to cut your own or use the el-cheapo filters."
5,Don't Go Abroad Without It,"This book is an absolute must for anyone teaching large, mixed level classes, a frequent challenge in many language classes. This book is one of the few that I always take with me when I am going abroad to teach in an EFL context. Often the placement of English language learners abroad (into university level classes) has little to do with proficiency as students travel with a cohort in pre-selected classes and earlier K-12 learning may vary greatly among students. This book is essential for confronting some of those challenges. It is easy to use, has great ideas and is very applicable to EFL and ESL many classroom settings."
2,Not good.,"I can record and play the sounds and here them fine. BUT <--- people over xbox can not hear anything. So, it is useless."
2,EMC Retrospect software,"Not fully compatible with Windows Vista Home Premium. Purchased it because my previous version (for XP) would not work with Vista. Guess what, this version of Retrospect also is not fully compatible. My next back-up software will not be Retrospect."
2,Too small for Garrett 350,"The description says it fits ""any fully assembled Garrett metal detector"". Not true. I have a Garrett 350 with the Double-D coil and it does not fit into the bag. I'm not a very tall person so I don't have mine adjusted to be very long. But I shouldn't have to collapse the thing to get it to fit into a bag that's supposedly made fore it. Pretty disappointed."
3,The Calls Worst,"Out of all the call albums this is their least interesting and their worst. Not only are the songs below average but they all sound the same, there isn't one stand out track on the album. I can't believe that people think this is so good. It isn't! You'd be best served to hunt down Red Moon, Let the Day Begin, Reconciled and their latest album To Heaven and Back for some true call classics or even Michael Beens ""solo"" album."
1,Don't waste your money,"Unfortunately I have bought this dictionary. In the English-Hebrew part the author just gives a list of Hebrew equivalents for every English words without defining the exact meaning of each one and no examples at all. If you look for ""fan"", you won't know which Hebrew word means fan like fanatic and which means fan like ventilator. I have made my Israely friends laugh several times because of this book. Also the letters are so small that a foreign learner will have a good headache trying to decipher them. Go for Oxford dictionaries instead, they are more expensive but worthy"
1,cd player,I can't get this thing to work. An LED display comes on for a couple of seconds and then it's gone. And nothing more happens. It didn't come with instructions - but how complicated can it be??? Very disappointing.
4,"I ""Gotta Tell You"" this is a GREAT Album!","Samantha Mumba's 1st album is a smash hit! With her first single ""Gotta Tell You"", I thought it was great! There should be more singles released b/c, I think this is a great album! ""Baby Come On Over"" is the other single, it's great! It delivers a greta mix of songs, and I hope to see more from her in the future.Letter Grade : B-"
3,This is ok...,"Samantha Mumba is from Ireland and I have not seen that many young pop artists come out of Ireland to the United States. For that I really admire her courage. In the us it seems like all people care about is an image,but this girl is a good singer. I like her new album,but there are a few flaws in it. For one thing,I do not like the song ""The Boy"". Whoever that rapper is needs to go away because he totally ruined that song. As for the song ""Never Meant To Be"",that song was never meant to be because it majorly [bad]! It's very cheesy traditional pop. (bubblegum)Though i don't like those songs,there are good trakcs on the cd like ""Till night becomes day"", ""gotta tell you"", and ""body II body"". Let me say one thing. Sam has talent and tons of potential and all i can do is pray that she will go out on her own an do something different from the Britneys and Christinas of the pop world. That is all."
5,Off the Hook,"My favorite group is 3-6 mafia from the memphis ten. On a 3-6 cd they had sample songs and yo gottis ""reppin north memphis"" was on it for like 30 seconds. I ordered the cd online cause they didnt have that in sacramento at the time. It was worth the $17 to me just to hear the rest of that song. You couldnt belive my happiness when I listened to the whole thing. This is just an incredible cd. The beats are Great and go great with the lyrics. I havent even listened to the cd for over a year just cause I dont think my stereo is good enough to play it. Thats not a joke either. Once my car stereo is On the same level as this cd then everyone is sacramento will know who YO GOTTI is weather they want to or not."
4,A Great Voice and Great Songs,"I would rather hear Michael Feinstein sing Irving Berlin's songs than anyone else. My only complaint is the choice of some of the songs. That's my problem, however, and not the fault of the CD. I would have loved to hear him sing ""I Love A Piano"" as he did on Irving Berlin's 100th birthday celebration. He really gave it a rousing rendition and I wish it had been included on this CD. I do like this CD enough to have bought extra copies for friends, however."
2,Disappointed,"How boring is this album? Well, we could not get through half the album before ejecting it from our car's player in favor of whatever NPR was broadcasting. ""Putting on the Ritz"" was the best of the lot.Most of the songs are unknown, and for good reason. They are not very melodic and most seem to be written in the same key, so listening to one is listening to them all. Of course I cannot speak for the second half of the album because we never got there.Within a minute, we were asking each other, ""Who can we give this to?"""
4,Great Speciality Whisk,Great whisk for gravys and sauces. Gets into the corners of pots and pans to keep all of the sauce well mixed. I would like a silicone wrapped version fro non-stick cookware.
5,Excellent sauce whisk,This Kuhn Rikon Heart Spring whisk is perfect for preparing sauces and gravies. Gets into the corners of pots and pans. Well built and solid. Dishwasher safe.
4,"Durable, handsome watch","I purchased this watch for my husband a couple of years ago and it is durable, handsome, and he is happy with it. Invicta is a very good brand. The only issue is that it is very difficult to change the time, because of the nature of the stem, to keep it waterproof. It is pretty tricky to access and turn. We never had a waterproof watch before, so we weren't familiar with this aspect of it! But we haven't had an issue of his watch going bad from moisture, so that is the trade off."
1,Never Received It,"Item never arrived at my house. Called company and they said ""we sent it"". Refused to send another and refused to offer credit. Can't actually say if the product is any good as I've never seen it...but I won't buy from this vendor again."
2,Collected Odds & Sods,"Spear of Destiny released some extremely exciting and original rock music throughout the 80's. Unfortunately, the ownership of the masters seems to be a bit of a mess, so this release consists of various live recordings and demos. As such, only of interest to the hard core fan and certainly not a ""Best Of"". A shoddy & disappointing cash in by the record label."
3,this is not an album by the band Immaculate Fools.,"This is a best of from the band Spear of Destiny, not the band Immaculate Fools. Spear of Destiny is a very good band, but not what you're looking for if you're looking for the Immaculate Fools. But, if you're looking for Spear of Destiny, I would definitely recomend this one."
4,good read,"As usual, you can;t go wrong with Ed McBain.His characters are always interesting and his plots keep your interest. I especially like the 87'th precinct stories and will read them all. Read a lot of them 20 years ago..Also saw all the TV shows about 87th precinct which Ed also wrote."
5,Fantastic!!,"I have been looking for this album since the early 80's. I just recently bought the CD last December 98 and I was really amazed at the great work of all the artists featured in this fantastic album ( i.e., from Bruce to JT to Doobie Bros. to Jackson Browne. This album confirms that music is not only a means to give enjoyment to people but also to reach out and convey relevant messages. Also, it shows that artist are also concerned citizen of this planet interested in the preservation of peace and survival"
2,Sounds of the Season: The NBC Holiday,"I just heard Josh Groban's ""O Holy Night""on the radio,it is beautiful, but I can't justify spending $32.00 for one song. Please explain why this 13 song CD IS $32.00.Sounds Of The Season: The NBC Holiday Collection"
4,Good CD.,"Got this CD for one song in particular that could not find on any other CD, The entire CD turned out to be pretty good!"
3,Get into the holiday mood,Overall an okay CD. Did not care too much for a couple of the tracks. Only purchased it for one of the tracks and that particular track was awesome.
2,Failed after four years,"enjoyed the TV and convenience of the built-in DVD until the DVD player jammed up earlier this year, rendering it inoperable and almost eating a rental disk. Then, this weekend, it suddenly stopped displaying any video regardless of the input used, sound continued on. Frankly I expect better reliability for something we've used so infrequently. I have ordered a tv only replacement for less than half the price since I suspect it's not reasonably repairable. Unfortunate disposable world today. I did not order another toshiba based on this experience, however."
1,Very Disappointing,"The screen is moderately clear, I would say fuzzy to look at and after two months with very little use, the dvd player no longer works. It is beyond the return date, so now we are stuck with a crappy tv and no dvd player. Guess you get what you pay for."
1,Should have never been made,"This cd is such a disapointment! I looked forward to receiving it and now wish I had not ordered it. The music is tired and unoriginal, it sounds like they are on major downers. The lyrics, oh there really aren't any."
1,This is a complete waste of money,"I bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday. This was a mistake. They say you get what you pay for? Well I don't think we got that good. I feel bad that I wasted money on this thing because it has taken maybe one good picture in the 2 years she's had it. I was trying to get her something inexpensive becuase she was only 13. Well it wasn't even that good. I can't take a decent picture with it and I'm a professional photographer! I will give my daughter credit, she tries to use it, but it eats batteries and that alone can get expensive. I have learned to pay more money for a camera if I want something decent and I won't even consider a Digital Connections for my 6 year old. I think they would be better off with a disposable camera."
1,Digital Concepts Digital Camera needs lots of work!,It is a waste of money. Very slow turning on. It takes 30 seconds for the flash to charge with NEW batteries. You have to redue the camera options every time you turn it on or will be taking low qualtiy shots. The flash is too bright for close up shots. Everything must be still during the shot because of the slow shutter speed. It does not have a wrist band so it can be dropped easily. Overall it is a $30 camera not a $70 camera.
1,Memory Eraser!,"I bought this camera because I have a great camera already but the A/V out plug is messed up. I thought ok, something cheap that uses the same memory card so I can upload to my computer. WRONG. As soon as I put the memory card into this useless junk, it erased everything. Hundreds of photos lost. And now, my original camera won't even aknowledge the memory card. It just reads, ""Memory error"" and wont let me take pics. If you use Digital Connections, expect it to ruin your memory card.Digital Concepts 4.1MP Digital Camera"
1,Junk,Dont wast your money on these plastic guards. They were not an exact fit and they broke on my second ride
4,"Good, Easy to Use, Easy to Clean","Sorry, but I have to disagree with the previous reviewer who gave this garlic press two stars. I have no complaints about this press and I am very demanding of my kitchen equipment having worked in the kitchen of a very good French restaurant. This press easily minces garlic and is easy to clean- emphasis on easy to clean. I find the scraper functional and the handle long enough for my average size male hands. If you are one to appreciate good design, the aesthetics are pleasing too."
1,Breaks easily,"The mobile is completely plastic. The mobile started leaning and when I looked to see why, it snapped off and luckily missed falling directly on my son! The piece at the bottom that connects to the crib is not secure enough to hold the load - obviously - or I just happened to purchase one that was defective! I think it could be made better. I would not buy again!"
2,A rating from GiGi -- Birmingham Mich. Age 13 Months,I didn't like this video. It seems geared more toward boys. I like the puppets and the kids playing with gender neutral stuff like in the other videos. Not to say girls don't like trains and boats and stuff but I like baby Noah or Doolittle where the puppets are hugging and waving and interacting or singing songs I can dance to.
1,Did musical genius kid loco REALLY put his name to this?,"having heard a grand love story and his dj kicks i was SEVERELY disappointed with this CD. can it be true that such a mastermind as kid loco really had anything to do with this album? why are there vocals? where are the off-the-wall and bizarre tracks i love him for? is there a whole other kid loco that i have just never heard of? almost every track grated on my hearing.in a nutshell - if you, like me, thought his dj kicks was absolutely amazing, then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS CD."
3,very small,"i shouldve know, this package was very small and it was sorta a let down, if you want to give this as a present for your friend, i suggest buying more than one order"
1,Horrible Service From abctoy4me Company,I didnt get my hi chew yet and ive waited almost 2 weeks horrible service do not order from them
2,Buy something better at the store!,"I ordered two of these for my sons room and the quality was very poor,what ur getting is flag board .In fact there are parts too this that u snap together,JUNK!I have ordered probably about two hundred items from amazon before and never did one of these reviews.But I was a sucker and got a punch...Don't be the next one too get a punch!!"
4,Pretting Color,"It's a pretty color and easy to use because it doesn't drip if you're careful.They are all toxic and dangerous but this one is much less so, making it the much more preferred.My Mother-in-law had such pretty hair and the gray did not wash her out. I was hoping to be like that ..but not the case. I tried everything to avoid unhealthy toxic hair color and if I were rich I could..As I said, if you feel you have to color your hair, better off going with this product than the totally toxic ones that seep into your scalp and you breath in...off the shelf hair colors."
5,Great Civil War photography,"As a self proclaimed History Channel addict, I find the American Civil War one of the most interesting periods ever. I grew up in Middle Tennessee surrounded by battlefields that lay witness to perhaps some of the bloodiest battles of the war. I live in Nashville and when I saw this book, I knew I had to have one. The photographs by Barnard are rich in detail and capture the essence of that place in time. I drive many of these streets daily and now I can visualize what these places looked like in the 1860's. The Chattanooga pictures are just as awesome. I've sat on Lookout Mountain and tried to imagine what it would have been like to be there during the battle. This is the next best thing. If you're a serious Civil War history buff, this is the picture book for you."
1,LAME and CHEAP,"I bought this tape thinking I would learn something: I don't dance at all. Half the tape is full of ""testimonials"" from other students. Some of the women look like deer caught in the headlights! To me, it was worthless. They do teach some basic stuff and you will learn, but very little. You'll learn more by going to a strip club. The instructor's movements seem robotic, as if she's never actually done this before. It was a waste of good money."
2,Go to a Club,"I bought this video because I thought it would teach me something I didn't already know. I was disappointed. You can learn just as much by going to a club and watching the dancers. It's not filmed very well. Mostly, the video contains testimonials from students who took the class."
5,Lenox solitaire platinum-banded Ivory dinner plates,Purchased 8 of these dinner plates and they all arrived in excellent condition. I fell very pleased they arrived with no shipment damage and all 8 dishes appear to be from Lenox's top rate quality line of this particular china pattern
5,DORINDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This video was a blessing beyond words. Dorinda really ministered through the whole video and she has so much energy and zeal for christ that you can hardly take you eyes off of her. Not to mention that she is beautiful.
1,Not sure what to tell ya'll...,"but this dvd is disappointing. Nothing seems to fit. Introductions by Eddie Long & Byron Cage at the beginning of the DVD and the hip-hop dancers struggle for belonging on this DVD. Why are there no shots of the band? The material is not worthy of Dorinda's anointed voice and the entire project seems thrown together. For these reasons, this DVD has only seen my DVD player once in the 2 years I've had it."
5,Dorinda is Amazing,"I have been watching this DVD for about two months straight since I got it. I was feeling discouraged in my life and the anointing of Dorinda's ministry and performance has uplifted my spirit so much and reminded me that I am still here by the grace of GOD.. I love the entire DVD. The sincerity shines through and her personal testimony is so wonderful. I have been a fan of Karen Clark Sheard for years and now Dorinda has been added to the list. If it had not been for the Lord, I would not have ordered her DVD and be here to tell you all about this wonderful ""Rose"" of gospel. There are truly angels watching over us all. Be encouraged and please get this DVD."
4,Nice tongs for certain use but won't replace traditional tongs,"These tongs have some really nice qualities. They are nice and sturdy and lock easily for easy storage. I particularly like using them for removing items from the toaster, flipping light, delicate items like fish, etc. But they really can't handle much weight at all without losing their grip so I find that more often than not I either need to use a regular spatula or traditional tongs. So these are nice to have in addition to these, but for the price, I'm not sure they are versatile enough for most people."
3,"Good quality, works most of the time","I'm probably still learning when best to grab these tongs instead of the more traditional ones we have in our utensil holder. I can't say they are my first choice yet, but not bad."
5,Accurate and true description of otherwise concealed facts,"This is a description of a major event in Italy, the causes of which were concealed and distorted in Italian medias at the time of the trials and afterwards. It is a new approach to one of the ""Italian misteries"""
1,Not what I expected.,"The version of ""Nowhere Girl"" on this disc is not the popular college radio version."
4,So Far---So Great!,"I've had the watch for about two weeks now. For the first ten days or so it was running about 7-10 seconds fast in 24 hrs. The last 3-4 days it's gotten broken in and consistently is off less then 5 secs. fast in 24hrs. That's as accurate as one of my Tag Grand Carreras and more accurate than the other and is very close to official ""Chronograph"" accuracy.It has an NH25A movement which I believe is from Seiko. In any case it looks a lot like the mov't in my Seiko 5.I like the looks of it but I don't expect much of the gold plating. I would have liked it better without that. Maybe if they had skipped the gold, they could have stepped up the quality of the bracelet. It doesn't look bad but seems kinda chintzy compared to the Tag but actually wears quite comfortably.Obviously it's too early to judge endurance. I'll get back with you later on that. Right now I wish they also had one of these available in green."
1,Not happy,"watch stops when you dont wear it.not a user friendly watch,time has to be set everytime you wear it. date is not accurate, has to be set again and again.does look very elegant when you wear it."
4,good value for money,I love this great looking watch !No complaints whatsoever and been wearing it every day since it was delivered !
1,Bad deal,This watch lasted 8 months before it stopped running. 1year warranty from Invicta which costs $28.00 and takes about 4 weeks from the date you ship and when you receive the repaired watch.
4,"High Class, For Low Cost","This watch is very elegant. It has a very high quality finish and gets loads of attention. The 23k Gold Plating is polished to a mirror finish and makes the watch look more expensive than it is. If I didn't know what it cost and someone told me it cost over $1,000, I would believe them. Very easy to wind or set the time and date. I really like the open back feature on this model. I will be buying more Invicta watches as my first has made quite an impression on me. My boss has a Rolex Submariner, but my Invicta 8928OB looks just as good. Be sure to buy this old Coin Bezel style as the new style is not nearly as attractive."
2,Poor workmanshio,"After 3 months the bracelet on this watch has fallen apart. Invicta wants $25.00 to warranty it which, I think is rediculous. I am going to have it repaired at my own expense."
1,Pretty but,"Watch looks great, but does not stay wound, even with every day use. Has been losing time 2-5 minutes per day.Very bulky"
3,Fells chip,It fells chip specialty the bracelet but look ok I guess for the price is no to bad That's what I think
2,Don't bump the crown,"The instructions say to screw the crown back tight after setting to avoid letting water into the case. I did that and after a couple of months of use, I noticed the crown had come loose, water had infiltrated and stopped the watch. Seems pretty fragile for a so called ""diver's watch."" Also, you must pre-pay return postage by cashier's check at $28 each way for an $86 watch which might or might not be within warranty--not a good use of my time. It is a lovely watch though."
4,watch out for blue dial,first of all this watch had a great box which is solid.also watch out for blue dial. if u love the color don give a second thought go for itelse order its brother with golden dialll...but its a great watch with good amount of stuff in itits worthwhile purchasing it
3,"For the price, you can't beat it","I've had several comments-people really think it's a Rolex. It's a very good looking watch, I love wearing it. However, there are times when the self-winding stops. I need to take it off my hand and vigorously shake it to get it going again. I don't know why Invicta didn't make it battery operated. I don't care if it's self-winding, all I care about it looks like a Rolex."
1,Poor customer service,"I would not recommend purchasing anything from this company due to extremely poor customer service. This is not related to Amazon, only Extang. I will never purchase an Extang product again."
3,riley,I did not like this book becuas it was very boring. I think they should have not talked so much. It was about a dog that was from the pound. His name was Riley. He was a mixed breed that caused toruble. He snaptped at any horse trying to bite it's leg off. The boys father sent Riley back to the pound. But all they did was talked for amost the hole book and the book was 236 pagis long.
5,Back Pain Reliever!!!,"I have considered purchasing an inversion table for some time. I knew someone who had one in the late 70s, andliked it because it relieved the strain gravity put on my spine.Since I have been going to physical therapy lately,I decided to look for one on Amazon.com and found the one Iwanted.Well, it's great! Gravity plays a cruel joke on the spine,and the Teeter Hang Ups F7000S Inversion Table(Factory Refurbished)was just the right unit.I believe I've said enough. So... If you have any kind of low back pain, Amazon.com probably has the right unit.D.Humpal"
5,Two for one,"This CD not only introduced me to Kid Ramos,but also to Lynwood Slim. Their style fits each other's perfectly. I was lookig for this music for years,but did'nt know exactly what to call it. So, now I know what west coast, jump, swing, blues sounds like. They should get together more. Kids' guitar and slims' vocal delivery are second to none. I love this music and constantly look for more, but they are only afew artists that do it as well Kid Ramos."
1,This film is not one of Leslie Cheung's !,"This is not a Leslie Cheung film, I wonder why it's listed under Leslie Cheung's. Although the name is the same as Leslie cheung's film ""Fatal Love"" in English, it confused people, since the introduction of the film said, starred by Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung, it's a big mistake !I'm afraid I cannot rate this one, cos' I don't have any idea about this film, I'm only familiar with the film ""Fatal Love"" starred by Leslie Cheung and Cherie Chung, definitely NOT this one !!!Seemed that I was unable to post this review if I don't give any rate to this film, therefore I reluctantly rate it as ""1 star"", I definitely don't want to give any rating to it, NOT EVEN ONE !!!"
1,Ripped Off,"I bought this CD for ""This Beat Goes On/Switchin' to Glide"", which, according to the menu, is included on this CD. When the CD arrived, there were only 11 cuts (#2 through #12 listed below.) The label and CD appear to be factory. BUY WITH CAUTION."
4,Question,What is the song he is listening to when he's driving in his car drinking milk and eating cereal? Does anyone know? It's right before his car breaks down
4,Classic Rock with a Jamaican Twist!,"I played the heck out of this CD when it first came out, but somehow misplaced it a few years back. I have tried tracking it down on itunes or other digital formats, but ended up buying the CD again here.Featuring the surviving members of Sublime (as collaborators), this album boasts some great reggae covers of classic rock songs. My favorites include ""A Whiter Shade of Pale,"" ""Love the One You're With,"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone.""If you're a fan of these classic songs, you should give it a listen, as these are excellent covers that are well produced."
5,Please CW is legend!,For those critics I would suggest you purchase a CD with strings and fabricated electronic synthesizers-really some creative work! CW is a legend in himself a GREAT AMERICAN storyteller with a huge dose of humor added to his work. I think CW (The real CW) is now in Ouray Colorado enjoying the Rockies and realizing the greatness of his story telling. I for one applaud you for creating this CD. Perhaps the person who suggested listening to this CD in hell could go there and send us a report after his stay! Keep up the good work and that continued sense of humor CW! BTW ronwelte when you return from hell feel free to send us the CD! SMILE!
2,Only for MSR and GWB fanatics. Tha Aire is not Fresh anymore,"This CD is something like a compromise of MSR and Chip Davis after the two towers catastrofe, with the july the 4th as frame. From Romantic Melodies and Fresh Aire 8, MSR lost the spirit, with semi-compilations as this shows that they must be retired. Please, leave our good memories of Fresh Aire in peace. Buy it used. With all my respects, only for USA citizens."
1,Not the quality you know from the Christmas CD,"This is a horrible collision of a Florida Theme park and Convoy (yep breaker 1 9)> I have loved every Christmas CD but this is a DOG. The Star Spangled Banner is a wimpy electric piano, and there are several ""songs"" that are read scripts that really sound like a poor copy of what you might find at a theme parks story of the US Presidents. At about the time you are ready to slit your wrist ""America the Beautiful"" comes along and you think that this isn't the worst you have ever heard. Convoy, the next song... is the worst. Fanfare is OK but get the real version from Boston Pops (Williams) America the Dream goes on or Telarc's American Jubilee (Kunzel)Over all a complete dissapointment!"
4,Almost as Good as the Christmas Music,"I love Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas music, so I've been collecting their music for other holidays as well. I wish they'd avoided the occasional speaking parts in this but I love most of the musical parts. They did a good job on the Aaron Copland piece! I'll be listening to it other than on July 4th."
2,This Album Is Dangerous,"Talking With The Taxman About Poetry has two very good songs on it-- ""Greetings to the New Brunette""and ""Levi Stubbs' Tears."" The other songs make this reviewer worried that Billy Bragg might be a socialist. He's sometimes hard to understand because he has a thick English accent, but on ""The Warmest Room,"" Bragg sings something about Chairman Mao. Even more obvious is ""Power in a Union,"" wherein Bragg sings about his love for Organized Labor and distrust of corporations. I believe that the album is dangerous because children or impressionable people could hear it and become socialists. It's a shame because the songs that are good are really excellent."
4,"so nice, so familiar","This CD grew on me really quickly, and it feels somehow very comforting and familiar to listen to. The combination of stickin'-it-to-the-man songs and love songs makes for an unexpected but very nice combination. Wonderful lyrics, and I'm glad about the contributions of Johnny Marr (of my favorite band, The Smiths). It's a nice, easy-to-digest CD, and you will enjoy it. My favorite tracks are Greetings to the New Brunette, Help Save the Youth of America, and The Warmest Room. Buy this."
4,Sleep-deprived in the Southwest,"Mr. Baudrillard's essay reads like the work of a visitor plopped down in the middle of the Southwest desert and deprived of sleep for several days. It has an alienated, disconnected feel to it. An attempt to understand American surfaces and vast desert spaces. But it is nevertheless worth reading for its penetrating comments about the nature of America. Just beware of the completely bizarre opinions which pop up out of nowhere like lizards out of sagebrush."
3,The Original without Copy,"Simulacra and Simulation (The Body, In Theory: Histories of Cultural Materialism)Baudrillard is admidttendly very tough to decipher.I read Simulacra about three times to get some kind of grip on his prose. The truth is that Foucault is just as difficult to extrapolate some kind of practical idealism. Baudrillard was a philosopher, great philosophers always keeps us thinking."
5,I love these.,They were easy to put on and remove. They make the care look way better. I love this proudct. I would reccomend it.
5,I will eat your children... HEY!,"From the beginning of this all-too-short EP, the guitars almost sound wacky. But soon, you realize it's all a part of their evil plan. Very goofy, dark, psycotic and playful. It's a murderous children's character run amock. If only it were just that. This one of my favorite pieces of music, seeing how it's not an album. But it is very rich and layered. Emotions range from a first person view of a mistaken identity murder victim to an apathetic to love song concerning the human race and a girl. Then goes into a song about the disgust of hypocritical people in their faith, living not as they preach or appear to live. There's a great tribute ""American Psycho"" by the same name, relating it to American way of life. The last song is actually my favorite. It's a song about lost love, tragedy awaits the significant other as, ""strangers in the dark are waiting."" Simply put, get this album. It's a definite must-have."
3,It's a matter of taste,"If you want to get inside Lee's head and see JKD through his eyes, this is a good book. The bad news is, the info is scattered all over the place, the illustrations are often quite unclear, and a lot of text is repeated in his other smaller books (Skill in techniques for example). If you're experienced in martial arts you may find a lot of useful things, about feinting and speed. If you're not, go practice at your local martial arts school, THEN buy the book. I wasn't really dissapointed with the book cause Lee never got to actually finishing it. As long as you look at it as a collection of ideas about what JKD is according to Lee, then it's a good book."
2,A Jumble of Thoughts,"Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee, published after his death, is neither a book in the sense it has a plot, nor a manual to guide learning. It is simply a collection of sayings, statements and raw sketches in search of an author or a great editor.There is very little connectivity between paragraphs that could give the reader a sense of where the author was heading. In essence, his survivors simply published his unedited note book.Some people might gain insight from reading this book; I could not unravel his message."
3,book,"This was puirchased for my youngest son,13, saw Bruce Lee's movie & became very interested in his practice of martial arts."
4,Really good,"I can't say much more than what has been said by the other reviewers. If you want to know more about Lee or JKD, you need this book. I knocked it down a star because some of the drawings are crude, but they get the point across. Also because in some areas it seems a little unorganized."
3,Interesting but Jumbled Insights To Bruce Lee,"This book was never actually written by Bruce for book form. This is a compilation of his notes and drawings. While this creates somewhat of a jumbled reading experience, Tao of Jeet Kune Do is still an interesting insight to how progressive Bruce Lee was for his time. What he created, which was carried on by Joe Lewis in the ring, was a practical, functional method of fighting that inspires martial artists to this day."
4,ESSENTIAL!,"If you are a Bruce Lee fan, interested in Martial Arts, A Jeet Kune Do student or be that a student of any Martial Art then this book is essential to you. This represents the inner workings and theories of Bruce Lee as he was developing Jeet Kune Do. Sure you can not learn an art form from a book but a book can inspire a prospective student, help guide a beginner and add to the knowledge of someone more experienced. If you are a serious student then read this book. It covers all areas of Bruce's personal training including warm-up techniques and fitness training.The journey then continues onto notes about combat strategies (tools, preparations, mobility and attacks). As I have previously said buy this book! If you like Martial Arts, Bruce Lee or just serious training then buy this Book!"
4,2,"Whether you're serious or not about the martial arts, I stronglyrecommend this book. Trouble is, if you're not serious you won'tunderstand a lot of it. Many of the concepts and theory presented arecomplex and require a strong background in martial arts to understand.Regardless, any beginner will be better off for having read it. Thisis one of those books you'll read more than once because there is somuch of Bruce's insight contained within this book. The book is notan exciting read, but it's one that you'll always keep. Tao containsBruce's philosophy, mind set, and techniques that made him unique. Irated the book as 4 stars only because it's not necessarily anenjoyable read, but it's a great one.Ted Weimann, author WarriorSpeed."
1,AXL WANNABE,"This album is trash, this band completely copies and tries to be GUNS N ROSES of the 1985-1989 era with the leather, boots and aviators. The lead singer of faster pussy in one video tries to be AXL in ""jungle"" with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelets and leather pants. Dont buy this imposter junk, go get Appetite for Destruction by Gn'R and rock out. No one can ever be AXL. The songs try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [being bad]. Also the lyrics try to be like brett michaels of poison and [are awful]. Rock on"
3,Can't complain,"I can't complain about this fan, it does feel cool its similar to those fans that they make for kids that are battery powered with the soft blades. This fan is quite noisy but if it's in the 60's than this fan will work fine but dont expect to be cooled off if you are on your laptop in 80 degree weather. For the price you can't complain but after I bought it i saw it online for $2. Over all its Ok deff room for improvement"
1,Do no go for it,"If you what a small usb fan, go with the targus brand, this one does not work, i got 2 and the are both in the trash..."
5,Last of the Wild Side,"The post Girls Girls Girls majorly wild Motley Crue was never as fun during the heyday of these guys. This was the last wild ride that spawned two instant classics, Wild Side and Girls, Girls, Girls. Everything up to this point secures Motley Crue as pretty darn cool, for what they are. Most of this album is pretty good and maintains ok as rock. This album embodies everything that is Motley Crue and the wild rock star lifestyle which nearly ended in the death of bassist Nikki Sixx. I'm glad they're all still with us. If you're still discovering the Crue, this is a worthwhile purchase in your collection. IMHO you need not buy anything beyond Doctor Feelgood. They still put on an excellent concert and I do recommend you go hear Vince pathetically garble his singing performance."
4,Perfect analysis of the American sports fan.,"Another humorous read by Joe Queenan. If you are a somewhat intelligent sports fan and not one of those people who show up blind drunk at a Mets game with your girl, so that she can flash her derrier tatoo at the Phillies left-fielder, then you'll identify with Queenan's take on the life of a sports fan. This book isn't written for the fan who runs around at an NFL playoff game on a frigid day with his shirt-off, but for the fan who hopes that ""shirtless"" guy just leaves him alone so that he can watch the game.Queenan uses his usual style of humor and self-deprecating wit to explain and analyze the behavior, and by his admission the sometimes unexplainable behavior, of fandom.A quick easy read for any sports fan with a sense of humor and an ability to say ""it's only a game"" even when you know that this really isn't true."
4,"Elderly be aware, You need strong hand, it's ""too"" well made.","After seeing TV's commercial (you know, those cheap and useless stuff), we decide on this good one. The built of this one is great, it is definitely built for life time use. To our surprise, the spring handle is so strong, each time we use it, we feel struggle to hold it close - it's like a workout for you hands. We gave it to a younger couple, they absolutely love it."
5,Very well made,Love these tongs. They work very well and I choose them because of the construction and the fact that they were all metal. I never use the locking feature except for storage. Very high quality.
1,nmrose,this book is dreadful! the jargon and accent is overwhelming. the plot and characters are poorly developed. the first half of the story is little more than soft core porn. definitely not worth the ttime or the money.
3,Hawkwind - 'Mighty Hawkwind Classics 1980-85' (Griffin),"Just how mighty are these classics?Until the time that the 'Golden Void 1969-79' 2-CD release came out,THIS disc was a good find.With twelve cuts total,the back cover of this disc lets you know WHAT old vinyl singles THESE tunes originally had come off of.With this release,you get an eight page booklet that informs you in detail about Hawkwind's four(4) 7"" or 10"" singles that the one that I think I liked the best was the 1977 issue of the song ""Motorhead"" backed with the extended eight-minute version of ""Valium Ten"".Have always dug that tune.For Hawkwind completists only."
1,Too Bad,"Too bad I can't review this book, since Amazon sent it to who-knows-where in Ohio and I never got it. Ohio... Arizona... I see the similarity."
2,Old book,There was a pile of free books at my school and this book was in that pile. I took it because I like to see what students used to read. My mother was trying to find the publication date and then saw that the book is for white children. It had racist slurs but I think given that the book was written in 1956 it may have been used in a private school. I read some parts and its an easy read for beginners I was just shocked with some of what was written.
1,unappealing and harsh,"A friend of mine at work bought this CD after listening to the intro and intermission on REanimation. Boy were we surprised to hear this CD. It has harsh sounding and highly annoying. We didn't realize that LP was not the producer of the album. We will check more closely on future purchases. Also I do not claim to have perfect pitch, but this seemed way off at times."
2,Rather pointless exercise...,"This diary has little interest: no political analysis and no view on military affairs... obviously Ciano and the rest of the Italian government and military have no clue about what's happening around them. They keep saying stupidly: 'this war is going to be long'. Needless to say, not a world of moral or ethical judgment.Most entries are criticism of some inept Italian General (too fat, and dyes his hair !), complaints about the Germans , or complaints about Albanians stealing silver cutlery at official dinners. Admittedly there is some emotion after 1942 when they start to realize that everything is going wrong, but the psychological analysis is very shallow (Ciano merely notes the 'depressed' mood of everybody after 1942). Nothing about Ciano's personal life in Rome's upper class, which would probably have been more interesting.For a clever (too clever ?) Italian view of the war, read Kaputt, by Curzio Malaparte."
4,Ciano revisited,"I was very impressed to know how unprepared was Italy to participate in WWII, and now it is easy to understand why all the disasters in Greece and North Africa campaigns. What attracted me the most reading this book is to meet the main characters of that drama almost as they were talking by themselves: Mussolini, Hitler, Goering, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin. Not a word about Jews and the massacres in Russia. It seemed to me that Galeazzo was totally indifferent to the many thousands of Italians dead or made POW. Mussolini shows through the pages all his vanity and clearly demonstrates how a single man can move his own people to starvation and destruction just because of his huge personal ambition. Oh, yes, there are similar politicians and national leaders doing the same in our time."
3,Back in the early 1990's,"The first few tracks on this CD exhibit some of the finest all-out thrash riffing you will find. The distinctive vocals chime-in and the session drummer is a powerhouse.Artillery fizzled after 1990's ""By Inheritance"", an good LP that was too clinically produced, without the trademark huge guitar sound. They're back with their new album in 2000 which picks up where they left off, but with a clear, powerful, in-your-face production.It doesn't have the diversity of B.I. or the consistency or nostalgia of Terror Squad and is perhaps a bit dated. That said, probably 7 out of the 10 songs are great. The others have their moments but...This is all-out thrash guitar riffs. None of that simple Korn stuff. Great stuff, but needs a bit of diversity. Haven't heard the bonus tracks which apparently show such."
3,"from whence came the ""?""'s?","the mixed reviews are understandable; however, i found the story entertaining. in the kindle version, the substitution of ""?"" for ""fi"" and sometimes ""fl"" was distracting in this and other books in the series. and i don't know why my capital button isn't working!"
4,a bit better than average historical...,"my only addition to most of the other reviews is the strange ""about face"" the author gives the heroine in the last 50 or so pages of the book. Up till that point the author writes a endearing, mature romance about two older (30's) characters who've been hurt by past loves and are realistically flawed because of it. The author then goes a bit wanky with her writing-having both the hero and heroine behaving so outlandishly you'll be wondering if you're reading the same book:)The book does have a happy ending-and the writing is at least above average. The love scenes are mild, to moderately erotic at the end.The hero, Simon, a man who was entrenched in women's rights issues-a hero before his time, and a true romantic-ya gotta love him!Overall, a pleasant read and I'll be trying more of this author's books. 4 stars!"
3,A bit boring,"Took me weeks to get through this book, It is the kind you want to finish, but it lacked, what ever it takes, to get you going.Simon was wonderful, but Eleanor was boring, and never changing. The ending was dreadful, I mean a romantic ending of course. But I wanted to tear out Eleanor's hair by the end of the book. I hated how she was such a blabbermouth. The one deep secret she had ..I don't think a soul in the book didn't know by the end. I would have tossed on her ear myself.... if I was Simon.Candice Hern, is a very gifted writer..and I know somewhere among her books, (this was my second) I will find a keeper, just not the two I have read so far. They lack what makes me not put a book down, to eat... or sleep... or clean my house. If my house is dirty, it means I am reading a good book."
3,a reviewer from massachusetts,"if i was asked what the best dokken album is i,would have to say its a tie between this,and tooth and nail.this album is more intellectual,and polished than tooth,but just as exciting just more mature. even to this date ten years after they tore it down ,the wall is still an interesting song''because of the guitar in it''.george was really in top form at this period in time. iyear,after this george left dokken,andin 1999 formed lynch mob.i gave this a3 star rating because no matter how great don' vocals are or mr.scary's guitar work is on this or the first 2 lynch mob cd's,mick browns headache inducing (bang them as hard as you can) wild drumming is always there to ruin it."
5,"Best Dokken disc, Hands down!!!!","I love Dokken,all their stuff,but"" Back for the Attack"" is their best.Beginning to end it does truly rock!With ""Lost behind the wall, and cry of the gypsy being my favorites!"
2,George sure knows how to waste potential,"The only good thing about this Cd is the ""KISS OF DEATH"", it gives us a glimpse of what George could of been doing if he didnt waste his time with making cheesey hair ballads. ""Dream Warriors"" is a good track but there is not a cd out there worth buying at full price, just for 2 good tracks. I never fully understood why so many people praise DOkken, all of their cd's suffer from being very mediocre. If you want some good LA styled metal with glam elements, that doesn't suck , check out W.A.S.P."
2,Flag Day,"This book could be carefully integrated into an elementary classroom to show that other cultures celebrate Flag Day as well as the United States. This book has a very good story line and is even a tear jerker at the end of the story. However, the pictures are in black and white making them somewhat enjoyable. This book deals with soldiers and shows them carrying guns demanding that the flags be taken down and again at the end of the story shows a helicopter and a soldier with a gun. This could make the book questionable in a classroom setting, although a good description of the time and reasoning for the soldiers could overcome some of the questions that may arise."
1,Wrong Item Sent,"Received the luggage in a box that had been obviously tampered with. A different, smaller piece of luggage was in its place, no paperwork, various garbage used as packing materials. To the vendor's credit, returning the item was very easy."
5,Pristine Pop,"The Pernice Brothers continue their tradition of pristine pop records with this fine album. I'd write more, but you really need to just buy the bloody thing (and both their previous releases). I'm not a fan of Scud Mountain Boys, though (just like the far superior Wilco had the overrated Uncle Tupelo as a parent band, The Pernice Bros. have Scud Mountain Boys)."

3,Not that great,"It doesn't even have an alarm of any kind... dissapointing. and it looks bogus.. I can't explain it.. but when you have it on your bedside, it just looks cheesy and plastic. but it works. and its cheap. so heck."
1,cop and a half,I bought this Dvd only to find it will not play on my Dvd player so i am now stuck with a brand new Dvd that wont play.
4,Wonderful characters!,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips has become one of my favorite authors. Her writing skill rises above those of almost every other author in this genre. She makes me feel like I personally know each character in her books, whether I like them or not! Her gift for dialogue is unmatched. Her characterization of southern males is spot on - and I think that's what makes this book so funny... I can actually *see* and *understand* Bobby Tom as he's rambling along, being oblivious to what is right in front of him. That said, the pacing was off a little in this book. I think Phillips let Bobby Tom be oblivious to his feelings for Gracie too long. It pulled me out of the story when I wanted to smack him every other page. The grovel scene worked toward making up for it, but it wasn't enough and, therefore, won't be a reread for me (I love BT too much to keep smacking him)- hence the 4 stars."
4,Very Enjoyable!,"After having read 3 books by SEP, I can safely that she will rarely disappoint and she doesn't, yet again in another of her football series. Although, I'm reading these in no particular order, I am really enjoying them. This is Tom Denton and Gracie's story and they're both very lovable characters and you can expect the same witty dialogues and the excellent sense of humor and timing by this wonderful author. I took one star away just because sometimes, I would skip a couple of pages since they felt too long. But all in all, Heaven Texas is a very safe bet for some great entertaining!"
5,Skin Protective Dressing,"I have to tape my knee cap to keep it from moving around too much. This gel helps keep the skin protective tape that I use on longer. I then use a latex based leukotape to keep the knee cap in place. Since my skin is sensitive to latex, I have to use the protective tape too. It works pretty good as I usually only have to change out the bandage every 3-4 days depending on my activities."
2,Meandering and Dull,"It's rare when I can't finsih a book, but I tried in vain with this for a month and couldn't end it. The author spends far too much time going into detail about a small part of John Dee's life, and seems to lose presepctive about Dee's contributions. We get too much of his court intrigues and that can get mighty dull. This book could have benefitted form being a good deal shorter."
5,What I like about this order,"I recently orderedEpson S041568 Double-Sided Matte Photo Paper (8.5x11, 50-Sheets). I am very happy with the paper. I wanted to make a digital photo album where I actually make it in to a hard bound book. The paper is excellant quality and is also an excellant price. I definately will order it again."
1,ITS JUST CARDSTOCK!!,"Ok, I got this thinking it was going to be quality Matte Photo paper, but I really don't see the difference from regular card stock. I compared the 2, one of which I purchased a ream at wal mart for half the price of this. Very disappointed in the print quality as well. Images look so much more vivid and bolder on regular paper than this. Don't waste your money. Its just card stock."
3,Universal Mobile Base,"When you put it together it's great. The hard part is putting it together. The wheels that don't move on one side, the bracket holding the wheel was made with little care to craftsmanship due to the fact that it was crooked and I had to sand down the nylon gasket to get the wheel to fit into the bracket. Also, there was rust on one part of the frame that holds the movable wheels. The paint was bubbling up and I had to get a drimmel to get rid of the paint and rust and repaint the bracket. The instructions to put together the base was very minimal. They sell this product at Sears, but it is way cheaper on Amazon, saved $30 on the price, almost half with free shipping - Sears wanted to charge me shipping too."
4,Vintage GA Airport Photos,"If you fly General Aviation on the Eastern Seaboard, or Gulf Coast, you are likely to be fascinated by this book. For example...New England aviators will enjoy excellent historic photographs, and concise histories of BHB, RKD, AUG, LEW, SFM, BVY, HYA, ACK, MVY, GON, and MTP. Really worth a look."
3,don't press your garlic over a glass bowl,"No instructions where given with this product, and it does get clumsy to use, usually flipping out and hitting my glass bowl. Otherwise, it works good when you finally figure out how to use it. Not as easy toclean as reported."
3,It does not clean well,"I bought this based on the great reviews, not realizing it was not self cleaning. My old one, bought in a grocery store 30 years ago, what looked like a piece of crap, was self cleaning and, worked great, and, lasted 30 years. This thing, does not clean well, the garlic sticks to the press, and is difficult to get off. A lot of money, and it doesn't hold a large clove of garlic. I am ordering another one, and this one is going in the garage sale. I am buying one here that costs 8.95 and got tried and true reviews."
5,Great garlic press,This is a great press. It is a powerful tool and is very easy to clean. I've tried cheaper presses and have been disappointed. This Kuhn Rikon is worth the money.
5,worth the investment,"When my husband recently broke our IKEA garlic press which I've had probably for close to 10 years, I decided to look for something that was a bit more heavy-duty. This seemed to fit the bill. We've been using it now for the last couple months and I am so glad I chose this one over theOXO SteeL Garlic Press, Stainless. I actually bought that one for myself several years ago but ended up giving it to my mom after deciding I liked my cheapo IKEA one better.This thing crushes garlic to perfection, and love LOVE how easy it is to clean. Honestly, I can't imagine this ever breaking. And if it does, it has a lifetime guarantee!"
5,"Expensive, but works great","This was recommended by Cook's Illustrated, and it lives up to its billing. It handles two large cloves and minces them beautifully. The entire mincing bucket swings out for easy cleaning. It was not cheap, but well worth the price. Best garlic press I've ever used."
4,Good product but way too expensive,"Indeed, this is a really good and sturdy press, but paying $30-40 for that seems excessive -- you might as well buy cheaper ones and replace them when they break. Well, if you're ok with the money and you need something that will not break down -- go for it. I certainly do not regret this purchase."
4,A big improvement over the generic ones,"This garlic press comes very highly recommended by Cook's Illustrated, my favorite cooking magazine and food website. It is very easy on the hands, holds a large clove of garlic and does press pieces of just the right size, so that I will not have to mince ever again. It is somewhat easier to clean than my old generic one, but not as easy as I thought it would be. I am glad that I paid $27 on amazon.com and not the recommended price of $40."
