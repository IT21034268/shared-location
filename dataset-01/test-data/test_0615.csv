3,It's okay,It was kind of helpful when learning forumlas but nothing to write home about. I think it helped a little since I did pass on the first try
1,"If you love Giulini and Mozart, don't get this version","Giulini is probably my favorite conductor and Mozart my favorite composer. The Symphonies 40 and 41 are among the greatest masterpieces of classical music. Unfortunately, these versions are not. They are slow - almost painfully slow, and hard to listen to if you are used to more sprightly versions - and, I might add, every version I have ever heard is more sprightly.Fortunately, Giulini recorded these same symphonies in 1965 with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. Those are masterpieces. If you can find a CD of those performances, don't hesitate to get it! And then you can pretend that these versions, recorded many years later, do not exist."
2,I love the French,This was an interesting film about a young girl (a rather dispicable character) who leaves home after a phyical altercation with her mother and hits the road with her boyfriend and a male companion with the intent of finding a new life in Tel Aviv and of their adventures along the way. The cinematography was great but I was very much disapointed to find that the video was not really in widescreen as advertised. If I had known I never would have purchased it. The film should be released on DVD in it's full screen size. I give it only two stars because of my dispointment.
3,Functional but poor quality,"The cage works ok at this price but it's weak, and the welds are sloppy.But hey, it's cheap right?"
1,Not Satisfied,I was unaware that this product didn't come with hardware to attach it to the bike - what a waste
2,WARNING!!,"I bought 4 of these from Yosemite Bicycles. Only 1 was as described. They all had the same part number, but 3 came with a handle bar mount only 1 matched the picture and could be mounted on my frame. I sent them all back and purchasedBlackburn Mountain Bicycle Water Bottle Cageof these instead. I am happy with them.2 stars because the 1 item I received as shown seemed to be of good quality, just hope you get the right one."
2,water cage,the wage cage looks good and is light weight but the seem joining one side of the rail is not even so it scratches the water bottle. I had to file down the seem and repaint the cage.
5,Fossil Women's Metal Watch-Glitz-Pink MOP Dial,This was is absolutely beautiful. If you like classy glitz and bling you will be extremely pleased. The actual watch has a deeper pink in the face than the picture shows. I love it. I saw a similar watch by Seiko for $599.99. You'll enjoy this.
5,College,My nephew has gone off to college this year and some of his books were so expensive we were lucky to find some of them here on Amazon and at a way better price than a retailer Very pleased with the books we were able to find!
5,Way too fun.,"After hearing about Shantae being the best Game Boy Color game ever, I decided to see if I could find a copy. I found that the cheapest copy was over a hundred dollars. Forget that. After doing a little searching I found out that the same people that made Shantae (WayForward Technologies) also made a little game called Wendy's Every Witch Way. It was far cheaper. I figured I might as well give it a shot. It can't be all bad if these people also made the best GBC game ever. I was happy to find out that this game is actually pretty damn fun. I'm unfamiliar with the character or where she's from, but this game is just a really well-made little platformer. Definitely worth it."
1,Do Not Buy,"Never worked, ate new batteries within 15 minutes of installation. Never got the first pic... Do not buy!"
5,skitz skitz,"They've come a long way in the past year...this CD is worth the buy. Much in similarity to Fall Out Boy, probably because Fall Out Boy's bassist, Pete Wentz was the one who discovered them.This album is a alot different from their older stuff, warn you. It's alot more poppy, with guest vocals from Patrick Stump (Fall Out Boy) and Hayley Williams (Paramore)."
4,Interesting sound,"If Something Corporate, Fall Out Boy and Panic At The Disco had a child it would be October Fall. They aren't as good as the afformentioned bands, but they're pretty cool. The money is worth it for the cd. Songs like ""Second Chances"" Caught in the Rain"" ""Walking"" Keep it Comin'"" make the cd solid."
1,What a total rip off!,"This CD is utter trash. Pure and simple.If you read the description on the back cover it shows such songs as ""Ghostbusters"" by ""Ray Erskine Parker, Jr."" but they are crediting the WRITER of the song, not the performer. While you think you are getting a nice horror-themed compilation CD with such classics as ""Ghostbusters"" or Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" and the B.G.'s ""Stayin' Alive"" what you really get is these songs remade, and poorly, by some anonymous studio band (possibly Dr. Love themselves).So understand going in that what you are buying is not the versions of these songs that you know and love, but insipid, uninspired covers of these songs by a band that never should have left their garage.Ughhh."
1,Very Disappointed,"I installed this product on my computer, and I cannot use it. I contacted the Peachtree software website, and they have not answered me. I then had to spend double what I paid for the Peachtree, and get another accounting software package. I will never order or use Peachtree again. Their customer support leaves a lot to be desired."
5,I Couldn't Put This Book Down!,"I had to write in just to say I couldn't put this book down! I couldn't get the thing out of my head, I just had to see what was going to happen next. Tiger Reef was just outstanding entertainment. Amazon: send me Crash Dive by this same guy. Too cool."
5,"Intelligence in Lyrics, what a concept","Rick is in rare form. He always had the gift for song even back during his SCTV days, no one did a better Merv Griffin parody. His songs are great and they get better every time you listen to them. This album really grows on you. I dare you not to be singing 'I never go no where' after listening to this album. Buy it and enjoy."
5,The Simplest way to get friendly with SNMP,SNMP was something completely new for me and i was struggling to understand it reading various RFC's. Althoug they helped but it was not unless i started reading this book that SNMP seemed something really interesting to work with.Sincere thanks to Dr Feit.
2,World beat fluff...,"Definively inferior to Banco de Gaia's previous work, this is nothing else than fake world music with some techno-electronic beats thrown in. It must be said that Drippy, the first track is a trully great opener, but the rest of the stuff is pure dissapointment."
5,Book Description,"Neca Stoller is well regarded as both a poet and poetry editor. Her success and acclaim are the result of her mastery of language and imagery. In ""How to Write Haiku"", Stoller uses direct and clear, but still beautifully evocative descriptions of the history and various elements of haiku and senyru.This book is perfect for beginner Haiku poets of any age, and has been sought after by school teachers even before it's publication. Take it on your meanderings through the wilderness - use it as inspiration to capture a moment perfectly.Sections include: What are Haiku? Historical Background of Haiku; Content of Haiku; Form of Haiku; A Guide to Three Line Haiku; Kireji - Cutting Word; Kigo - Seasonal Theme; Getting Started; Senryu; Your Turn and more!Available as an e-book and combined with ""How to Write A Cinquain"" in both e-book and print form.For more information regarding this and other great books, visit http://www.streetsaint.com."
5,Best Place to Start,"That is, if you want to get into the music of Les Paul & Mary Ford, then this is the best place to start. I've owned this for about 5 years now and I've always enjoyed it. All the songs that established them ('How High The Moon', 'The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise', 'Voyas Con Dios' ,etc) are on the first album on the CD titled 'The Hitmakers'. Also included are some other famous covers and some amazing Les Paul instrumentals. Literally, 'The Hitmakers' is almost a greatest hits album, that showcased Les & Mary as being ahead of their time. The second album on the CD, 'Time To Dream' is somewhat the opposite of 'The Hitmakers', it was releasd about 4-5 years later and is a very subdued, almost introspective production. Very little in the way of Paul's frenetic fret work and/or multi tracking, his minimalist playing lets Ford's vocals express a vast array of emotions on this album. In all, the best starting point to enjoy Les & Mary is with this CD!"
1,I had to return it due to missing parts.,I did not use it because missing the handle. So their was no rating given.
3,A tenor in baritone key,"I was very interested in this recording of ""Winterreise"" and just now listened to the 5 choices you offer on amazon. I have to admit, I don`t know the whole recording - but I dont think it`s o.k. that out of five songs three were a whole step down, one (""Gefrorne Tr√§nen"") a half step and only ""Lindenbaum"" in original key (it only goes up to an E of course). Additionally the tempo of ""Gute Nacht"" is ridiculously slow. I was very interested in the CD of this truly great singer, but now I don`t think, I will buy it!"
3,Agree it's incomplete,I like this show and have the first 2 seasons on DVD. I will also wait to purchase season 3 until it isn't cut.
3,"Love the show, hate the packaging!","We have loved Eureka since it first aired, and purchased the first two seasons as soon as possible. This new set however is frustrating and annoying, partially because there is NO listing of what episodes are even included, let alone which disk they are on!Well, so I figured I would look up the listing on the website mentioned on the packaging ([....]). BIG mistake! The website was horrendously slow trying to load some sort of animated something, did not respond at all well to mouse clicks, and even after I finally got to the page regarding the product, it didn't have the info I wanted. It told me about the bonus stuff, but not what episodes were where! And no, I'm not using dial-up, I do have broadband.So I'm kinda frustrated, and I also fear that this sort of website neglect is symptomatic of the same sort of poor planning which makes good shows disappear!"
1,Don't Support Split Seasons!,"Eureka is a great show, but people who buy the ""split season"" DVD are supporting the concept of selling seasons in two parts. Remember, the company that is doing this is the same one that changed its name from SciFi to SyFy. They seem incompetent when it comes to marketing and knowing what the user wants. At every turn they try and do something to alienate (no pun intended) their userbase. The only solution is to stop buying their products until they change their behavior. Watch the show on TV, but don't buy split season DVDs until they change their sales tactic. By doing this in mass, SyFy (I pronounce it SeeFee) will get the message."
2,It would be nice if the whole season were included.,"Great show and great episodes. But the fact that this says ""Season 3"" and it doesn't have all the episodes is deceptive. You really have to look hard to find that it's not the entire season."
2,"I'll wait, thanks","It's no fault of the show that season 3 was truncated to 8 episodes. They had announced that the rest of the season would air late winter/early spring. That obviously hasn't happened.Sci-Fi is launching a rebranding of their network to ""SyFy"", as the term Sci-Fi cannot be copy-written. It's to launch this summer, with Eureka as the banner show. I'm guessing that the 2nd half of season 3 was folded into a full fledged, extended season 4 - which is fine. But that doesn't justify charging full fare for a 1/2 season. So, I'll wait and get it used for $8 or $9 or so."
1,Rip Off Artists!!!!,8 Episodes. The season isn't over yet. I'll wait until I can get ALL episodes in 1 nice neat lil' package.
5,awesome show. all one stars for packaging are too slanted,"This show rocks, it makes science cool and the people who change the world with science the heroes of the day. I do think that 27 one star reviews on packaging along is rather harsh. Of course it would be better for the whole season to be on one boxset but didn't they put this out before the second half premiered? even if not I wouldn't go less than a three for packaging because A one star review is for something that EVERYTHING is wrong with I think. (not just packaging and lack of a full season) I love this show and although I want each season on one boxset I can't go less than five stars because this show entertains me immensely. Hopefully they will make more eps in season 4 (why not make 20 a year?) and I bet they will split it up. and the boxsets will be split too. after all they have 6 months? between halves of the season."
4,Never a disappointment!,"I wasn't aware that season 3 was in two parts - so I thought I was getting a better deal than I actually did - but beyond that, it is never a disappointment. The shipment arrived days before I expected it and I passed it to my dad to watch first and he watched it all 2x before returning it!"
1,2 Thumbs Up to Eureka/2 Down to SyFy-Universal,"Eureka still out classes most of today's TV series offerings, but I'm jumping on the bandwagon of those opposed to purchasing one season in two full-priced installments. Sorry, SyFy and Universal, but I'm not responsible for the writer's strike... wasn't involved in it in any way... so why do you expect me to pay for it? When you come to your senses and release a reasonably priced full third season, I'll be fighting my way to the front of the line to purchase it. Until then... count me out."
5,Awesome,This show is so amazing. My family and I sit down and watch it together when there isn't anything on tv.
5,Delicious and unique,"I bought the pineapple and the apricot, not even sure I'd like either. They are both very good! I have increased my fruit, veg and water intake and this is an easy way to do it. I keep them on hand at home and work. The crisp is unexpected and unique. The fruit retains most of the nutrition and a ton of flavor."
1,"Not as ""Classic"" as it could be","While Pong, Centipede, and Asteroids WERE groundbreaking, they aren't ""Classic"" on this console. If you're one of the rare types who finds the old Atari games more mesmerizing than any of the new stuff on the market, then you could potentially enjoy this title.Otherwise, it's hard to have any appreciation for this if you switch game cartridges from Meteos or Mario Kart to this. Retro Atari just doesn't deliver.It should also be noted that the controls aren't consistent. For some games you have to use the stylus to ""Touch the Screen"" but as soon as the game begings, you're required to use the directional pad."
1,"If I could give NO stars, I would","So I'm pretty much beating myself up right about now b/c I didn't read any reviews before purchasing this item. If I could give zero stars, I would have. This game is so cheap, it's not even worth 1 penny. I downloaded it at noon and uninstalled it by 12:02pm.I own other slot games (ie. Reel Deal Slot games by Phantom EFX) and this slot game doesn't even come close. The graphics are pathetic, and like others have written, it's not exactly 7007 games. It's only a couple of different games w/ a bunch of variations to that game.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy a Phantom EFX game instead, you'll thank me later.Now, I have to find someone that I could give this away to."
1,worst slot game EVER!!!,"Never in my gaming life have I been more disappointed than I was when I anxiously unwrapped my new slots game....and got this!! the creators of this game should be ashamed of themselves, lining their pockets with everyone who's bought this without reading reviews first money...my bad...and then not having anyway to return it...shiesty tactics, if you ask me"
3,Good story but confilcting information,"I read the book and enjoyed it. However the one thing that bothered me about the book, is that it seemed as if the authors focused only on the plot of this book and not on the information that they put into their first book, in areas where the subject matter overlapped.Both of Chantel's parents were dead and all she had left, come graduation, was a step-mother.The Exiles: Chantel (The Creoles, Book 1)So how was she visiting with her parents at graduation?I know this seems like a small matter, and it doesn't really affect the plot of this story. But if someone is going to write a series I would appreciate it if they took the time to make sure that the books didn't conflict each other."
2,NOT for an exercise ball,"Bought these to pump up my exercise ball. DO NOT GET THEM if you are going to try that. They are not made well for exercise balls. I'm sure they'd work for swim floaties, but nothing more."
1,What the hell happened??????????,"ill give it that its still better than all other new metal like Korn, Slipknot, Marylin Manson. and you can have a valid point for arguing that it blends nice metal and industrial. BUT IF YOU ARE A TRUE INFLAMES FAN.... DONT GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!! OR REROUTE TO REMAIN!!!!!!!!!! their changes of music styles and song writting is really depressing and sad, there is nothing that sticks out in their songs anymore, its like all the emotion has been drained from them and replaced with corporate recylced garbage! and besides, i hate industrial, so im not found of the transitions. if you like true metal, or listen to other good music, dont waste your time and money on this!!!!!!"
5,"A Really Extraordinary Book, Worth Reading!!!",This book was one of the best accounts I have read of the turmoil and savagery suffered by the people in concentration camps. The remarkable courage of Mitchell makes for fascinating reading. The story of his survival makes me believe that angels do exist...and he must have had one watching over him throughout his experience.
4,The best on the ITF forms of Taekwondo,"This is probably the best and most efficient account of the Taekwondo Hyungs. The photographs are clear, and the movements are relatively obvious. I have read this book for a long time. However, on the downside, I would like to add that the verbal description of the forms is very short. What is most irritating, is that the application of the forms are not explicitly dealt with. There are some verbal indications given at the beginning of each Hyung, but the lack of explicitly shown applications, stops me from giving it 5 stars.Also, it could have benefitted from some arrows, indicating movement.Perhaps these minor downpoints could be remedied in later editions?In all, still probably the best series written on the Hyungs."
1,"No, no!",Charlotte Church has a decent voice but Jennifer Lehmer is 11 and has a BEAUTIFUL voice! Her CD will be sold this year on here so watch for it!!!!
5,Fit perfectly in my 2001 Toyota Corolla S,Good weight and build quality. Worked as a perfect replacement in my 2001 Corolla S. Easy to install. Matter of removing 3 bolts. Still perfectly functioning months later.
3,Introducing the Groove Armada...,"""I See You Baby,"" the first US single from this British duo with a curious name, is an ample taste of what we can expect from their full length album dropping in February. The first three mixes are radio edit length and groove with various funk interpretations, from Fat Boy Slim to Norman Cook. The Futureshock mix is a club attack at a more club-inspired length too.The next two tracks are remixes of other album tracks which could comfortably be called ambient trip hop. This is also an enhanced CD, and there is a video for a previous UK single, ""At The River."" This video is futuristic and alludes to a virtual world. The song is lilting trip-hop, sampling Patty Page's old crooner, ""Old Cape Cod."" Mesmerizing!"
3,Popstar is what you would expect,"Okay so the movie is very predicitable. Why not, I have to say I enjoyed it. I have been a fan of the backstreet boys for years and had my fair shair or aaron carter concerts, so I figured I had nothing else to do one night and rented the movie. My parents also watched it with me - it was a great family movie. The acting was not up to par, but I will say that it was almost soo cheesy that you couldnt help but laugh and get put in a great mood. The basis of the movie is the girl next door becomes friends with the superstar. What every little girl dreams of, its a great movie for kids, and heck i even found it entertaining myself. I say go ahead an watch it if you need that good feeling that will make you a dreamer again."
1,"Aaron Carter Stole the Story of ""The Biggest Fan""","So, the other day, my granddaughter asked me if I wanted to watch ""Popstar"" with her. I said yes, and she popped the dvd in. While watching the movie, I was thinking, ""What the?!?!? This movie stole The Biggest Fan's story!"" J.D. McQueen falls for his biggest fan, Chris Trousdale falls for his biggest fan. Jane Brighton is J.D's biggest fan, Debbie Worden is Chris's biggest fan. I always knew that Aaron Carter was a copier! This movie sucked. I didn't like it. Whatever you do, don't buy ""Popstar""! It's such a cheesy movie! Thank God it wasn't ""The Biggest Fan 2""!"
3,It was an OK beach read but not much more,This book was a passable read. It contained some interesting information that was not generally known by the general public. The writing was repetitive and in many places dull as dishwater. Don't pay full price for this book---buy it used since you won't be all that interested in keeping it.
2,Needed: Good Editor,"I found this book to be very disorganized - no discernable order/timeline - and extremely repetitive. Author's 'voice' is snippy and accusatory which didn't make this book enjoyable to read. Also, most of the information is anecdotal and second-hand so question the credibility and accuracy. Could have benefitted from a skilled editor."
3,"Not the Man, but the Era","More of a gossip driven expose' on a particular Hollywood scene/era, than a biography of Henry Willson. A less reputable aspect to the 40's - 60's Tinseltown star machine is covered in all of it's sordid ""glory"". The seamier side to many A-list and no-list figures of the day are exposed in frank detail. Once read, you likely won't be able to look at certain films, television shows, or celebrities in the same fashion as you once did. Yet, you also won't have much of an understanding of the man at the center of it all, aside from what he did and where those actions ultimately left him."
5,best lubricant,"My wife and I have tried several lubricant brands. Astroglide is the best without question. All the others are a combined waste of money. This product especially enhances a hindered condom interface. It is also the best ""personal"" lubricant I have ever used."
3,Slice of life with a dash of Kaiju.,"This was very differnt from what I was expecting. Instead of a fairly typical Kaiju movie with Something Big tramping over Tokyo we get an interesting, if odd, look at several misfits connected with a prophetic vision that one of them has of a future disaster. More of a character study that an action film. The dream/prophecy sequence of Demeking doing what all Kaiju do was very well done and an interesting looking monster scored for me. There are several indications that the prophecy will arrive. This was based on a Japanese manga or graphic novel and I have no idea if the original story line was continued beyond the stopping point of the film. Worth a look if you know what you're getting into."
5,The only book that truly rivals 'The Celestine Prophecy'.,I have searched for books which follow a spiritual journey similar in power and text as 'The Celestine Prophecy' and this is the only one that even comes close. This is a truly riveting book which is hard to put down. It is a combination of a spiritual journey and a quest for extraordinary historical artifacts. This is one of the few books that makes the reader feel they are really participating in the events of the book. The way it is written allows the reader to visualize or image the events being described throughout the book. The only regret is that it was over too soon and it leaves you hungrey for more. Hopefully Irving Benig will be publishing a new book soon.
1,Failed after two years,"I had this memory card from 1999-2002, and when it worked, it worked great.Then one day, the LED display that allowed you to switch between memory blocks stopped working, and the card died shortly after. As in, when I was frantically trying to transfer back-up copies. I lost hundreds of hours of game playing. I was very upset.This will probably end up being an uncommented upon useless review, as this item is rare and no longer available. Why is it rare now?? It had a small shelf life. So if ever should have an opportunity to buy this -- don't! The card will betray you, and you'll lose everything you've saved on it. If you need high memory capacity look elsewhere, my overpriced 'official' PS1 sony 1MB memory cards still work, and sometimes I still wish I bought more of them instead of this."
4,Massive data collection,"I am a fan of this book. That being said, I will also say the majority of it is not fascinating and did try my patience at times. There is an overwhelming amount of data that is presented. I think that the fact someone took the time to gather all of it and analyse it in this way should be applauded. It is information that previously had been assumed, taken for granted, not known or wrongly believed. It allows us to look at the historical facts in a completely objective manner, and is eye opening in many ways. I will definitely try to implement some of these strategies in the future.I do think there is a lot of material in the book which could have been cut out (and maybe should have been) without having any real loss of valuable information. Are all the data and details of every losing strategy actually needed? Overall, I believe the book is a ""must have"" for any serious long term investor!"
2,Disappointed - a small investor review,"I was disappointed with the book. It was not as helpful for the small, individual investor as I wanted it to be. $10,000 spread over 50 stocks means investing $200 per stock without even talking about any fees for buying and selling 50 different stocks. So from this book I can narrow down my indivual selection of stocks to 25 or 50, but if I only want to purchase 3-5 stocks how do I decide which 3-5 of the 50 to buy?The book did give me a broader understanding of the different strategies used behind mutual funds. When I review a mutual fund's strategy, now I know the lingo and what the fund manager is looking for in a stock and how that strategy compares to other strategies. So I think the book has made me a better mutual fund shopper, but has not helped me as much in purchasing individual stocks."
2,Check out the watch photo,"The image in the photograph is not very good. I think it will be hard to sell this watch when the icon on the face, where the 9 is, is broken. You might want to choose another photo."
5,age appropriate,Good book for 4 years old and younger. It has a lot of pictures and keeps their attention. Our little girls really enjoyed it.
4,New Full Length CD,"I fell in love with Cary Bros after ""Blue Eyes"" on the Garden State Soundtrack. The wait for this full-length CD was worth it. All the soulfulness you would expect along with great lyrics and music. Love this CD!!!"
5,Awesome Guitar Case,I have never been so satisfied with a purchase. This is the best guitar case I have ever owned and it was half the price of others. I have a large 12 string guitar and it fits absolutely perfect in this case. The case is very high quality both inside and out. It is sturdy and secure and the interior is very plush. There is also a fairly large compartment inside for additional guitar accessories. The guitar case was delivered to me just three days after purchase--amazingly fast delivery. Dynamite product in every way.
4,A decent case for the money,"I bought this to house my Washburn WD25SCE. It arrived with a couple of air bubbles here and there, but nothing to cry about. The build quality is fairly solid, opens and closes without issues, and it came with a set of keys. The interior is soft, well cushioned, and my guitar fits into it well. The gold accented hardware is pretty nice and, overall, it looks like cases I've seen for twice the price. Not bad."
1,Simplistic and Stating the Obvious,"Who has ever heard of David Lereah? Is he a small time player in the investment arena? If you are completely oblivious to the industry this book might help. But if you have a clue on what's going on, you can figure this stuff out for yourself. I'm sorry but I feel I wasted my money."
4,Oh come on... it's not that bad!,"Surprisingly engaging dance remixes of material from the 2002 ""Eternal Youth"" album...As a cohesive piece of work, this may even hold up better than the original album."
1,Unimpressed,"I was quite dissapointed with this movie. It was disjointed and lacked plot. There wasn't really any resolution of the character either. I got the feeling that the people who made this movie didn't really want to take the time to tweek and refine the movie's script etc... Quite sad for me, as a christian I would expect better."
3,I WAS DISAPPOINTED,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE OF SEVERAL TIMES I SAW THESE GUYS ON PBS SPECIALS. I WANTED THEM TO EXTEND THE SONGS THE WAY THEY DID ON PBS; ESPECIALLY THEIR SIGNATURE SONG ""LOOKING FOR AN ECHO"". THEY DIDN'T. IT WAS LIKE THEY MADE THE ALBUM IN A STUDIO. THEY SUNG A LOT OF OLDIES, & DID A GOOD JOB. THEY MAY LOOK LIKE AN OVER-THE-HILL BUNCH OF WANNABE GANGSTERS (AFTER ALL, THEY'RE FROM BROOKLYN), & LEAD SINGER KENNY VANCE MAY LOOK LIKE HERMAN MUNSTER, BUT THESE GUYS ARE THE GOODS. THEY CAN REALLY SING. AND VANCE, EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T DO IT ON THIS ALBUM, CAN REALLY HOLD A NOTE. THESE GUYS ARE THE PLANOTONES, AND THEY ARE GREAT."
1,salon owner & STYLIST,"This was the most boring book, and not anything helpful for a service or retail business of any kindthis author loves to talk about talking"
2,A Lot of Smoke and Mirrors,I'm a sucker for self-help books. Every now and then I find a gem or two in one. That didn't happen here. And I can't help but wonder how he and his publisher concluded that the contents validated the title. They don't.Save your money. Go to a good movie instead.
5,This book has totally changed my thinking!,"Before I read this book the idea of being a ""salesperson"" made me feel slimy and uncomfortable.Michael helped me let go of my limiting beliefs and dramatically shifted my perspective of the sales process.As a result, I'm out there helping others and changing lives. My business is booming and I'm Getting Booked Solid!Definitely a refreshing change from all the dry and boring business books I've bought before, but never got around to finishing. Michael has the magic touch!"
1,Horribly done STOLEN songs,"It seems this entire CD is just a collection of songs they stole and poorly remixed them. All of the songs are horribly hard to listen to and make you want to claw out your ears from the overused loud instruments that sound like someone scratching a chalkboard with a piece of metal, and not to mention the vocals that are agonizing to the human brain itself. I never knew one band that could single-handedly take so many good songs and such a beautifull style of music and make it suck!"
1,"this is the least suspenseful ""mystery"" I have ever read","This is the first and the last Desiree Shapiro book I will ever read. The main character Desiree might be comfortable with herself and funny in her own way, but she has no problem solving skills. I figured out the killer in the first chapter and continued to think it was the same person throughout the book, only to find out in the end, that it was exactly who I thought it was. BORING and STUPID. I love mysteries, but this book not only lacked good humor, it also lacked any mystery."
3,"The foot or me, who knows what the problem is.","I'm fairly green in regards to my sewing skills so I may be to blame but I couldn't get this foot to work properly (that's why I rated it in the middle as I'm sure I'm at least partially to blame). Mine was not supplied with any instructions but after watching a few tutorial online I kept trying and could never get it to roll the hem over and give a finished edge. It would fold over the edge but never roll so I always ended up with a raw edge sticking out. I tried feeding more and less fabric in and always the same result. So I may be faulty or the foot may just not work very well, who knows. I also noticed that fit wasn't ideal as the needle just barely rubbed on the foot. I have an older Singer (probably late 70's early 80's). So overall, for the price it was worth the shot but disapointed that I couldn't get it to work."
3,Watch Full Metal Jacket.,watched the movie and you read the book. literally all that would be great lines in this book were used in the movie. Other than that it wasn't that captivating. I find it way overhyped.
1,Incoherent mess,"I made it to page 52 before I gave up. Rambling babble with no structure. It is just Herr attempting to impress himself page after page. Very pretentious. I mean, here's an example from page 44: ""If milk snakes could kill you, you might compare the Mission and its arms to a big intertwined ball of baby milk snakes. Mostly they were there that innocent, and about that conscious. And a lot, one way or the other, had some satisfaction.""WHAT?? Huh?? What did I just read?? Did that make ANY sense?? Amateurish prose masquerading as intellectualism. I mean, half the passages in this book could be submitted to that yearly contest they do where people send in the worst possible opening sentences of imaginary novels.I read all the good reviews and was excited to read this book. But man, it's horrible. One of the most poorly written books I have ever attempted to read. Big thumbs down."
1,Unrealistic and grossly dramatic,"This book over-dramatizes everything. It's not possible to see a look in a man's face and get 6 ultra-dramatic impressions from it. And then to write about every one of them!! Herr might say,""The look in his face could have sheared off a mountain at its base, chopped it into a million pieces and scattered it over a thousand square miles. Puuuhlease!!! A few times in a book such a description adds impact, but this entire book is written this way. Seldom have I seen an author pound a writing technique to such smitherines as this guy does."
5,The best of a good bunch...,"I read Dispatches when it first came out and still find it to be the best of all books from the Viet Nam war. For history you might want to read Stanley Karnow's Viet Nam, for the best in fiction try Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried, and for an oral history nothing is better than Gloria Emerson's Winners and Losers, which is a stunning and even handed look at the most controversial of all wars. I have always counted Dispatches as one of the ten best books that I have ever read."
4,Good product. Be careful with use--itching/burning can occur occasionally.,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this product. My boyfriend and I were looking for a spermicide to use on top of contraceptive pills as an extra precaution, and it was a frustrating search. The first product we tried (VCF) was expensive and had a very high percentage of Noxinol-9--it caused itching and burning for both me and my boyfriend. Gynol II Jelly has been much less irritating. It still seems to cause itching and burning if it gets in the urethra, so it is important to apply it as far back in the vagina as possible and wipe it off carefully if it leaks out. With careful use it has been comfortable and easy to use. One tube has lasted us quite a while--I would guess at least 20-30 applications."
1,Flimsy,"I purchased these knives at a store's closing sale for $130. The list price was $329 so I thought I getting a great deal on a good knife set. I was very shocked when I got home to find them to be so flimsy. They are also very light and they don't fit well in your hands. I would not recommend this purchase. I ended up getting a J.A Henckels set from Bed Bath and Beyond and am MUCH happier. They are very sharp, fit well in my hand, and the blades are very thick and sturdy."
3,BEWARE!,"This is NOT the same Smile that released ""Girl Crushes Boy.""Not that its that bad (luckily for me I like pop music) but if youre expecting to hear Mike Rosas songs you'll be very disappointed! This Smile kinda sounds like ""Minus 5"" a little bit to me, the songs are pretty light hearted, good pop rock songs. But honestly... I would not have bought this if I didn't think it was the other Smile."
3,"I'd like to say this movie is a dog, but...","I managed to catch it on cable a year or so back, and thought it was pretty decent as far as cheesy-70's ""nature attacks"" movies go. Even with the bloodthirsty poodles. I remember a setpiece involving a rabid dog chasing the characters through a cabin that I found surprisingly hair-raising and theres a sublimely absurd scene where the dogs chase a vehicle onto a dock, and come to a screeching halt when the vehicle starts to back up."
1,Came undone in a few short months! VERY Poor Quality!,"Braided rugs are supposed to be durrable. That's why I purchased this for my nursery. But before my baby was even mobile, this thing came apart. First the braiding seperated in the center so there was a big split. I had the rug placed in the center of the room with no furniture near it so the split was quite obvious but after a few months it was too late to return it so I kept it. Then a few weeks after the split the ends started to frey and come undone. I never washed this rug on only ran a light vacuum over it a couple times. What a disapointment!!!"
2,False Advertising,"I ordered this sword because it said it was a ""carbon steel"" Last Samurai Sword. It is stainless steel(Stamped right on the blade) which is a huge difference and it is actually a Kill Bill Demon sword. I like the look and feel of the blade but I was very dissapointed in the deseptive way it was advertised. I don't recommend it."
3,CDN Audio -- Frig/Freeze alarm,"works fine in the frig, when put in the freezer the readout is wacky, never know what number will be displayed, so ended up buying a different type for the freezer and keep this one in the frig where it works fine"
3,freezer alarm,"works ok but the high temp alert needs to a lot louder, although it was priced fairly for the functions it performs."
1,Not worth the time,"Clute struggles to create an interesting vision for the future, but his vision is so clouded by his own ""language""(I'll bet that he thinks he's being clever) that it takes too much effort to get through to the story. When you finally do figure it out, he has nothing to say... his grand conflict between god and the universe left me completely bored. And what really annoyed me, was that Clute has the gall to describe in the aknowledgements how he used elements from two Borges stories (an author who I greatly enjoy) to create his mess. Don't waste your time with this book - if you want to read some trippy sci-fi, read some Phil Dick."
2,blah,its the same old boring and unfunny jokes it always was. in my opinion it wasn't funny at all. i'm gonna get crap for it but i just thought it was stupid. larry the cable guy is the worst comedian ever. same goes for bill. the only one on the tour that wasn't over rated was ron. ron white owns. so yeah i gave it 2 stars for ron. but this totally not worth the money.
2,It is really a mouse pad!,"Listen all, it is a good idea to have the rudiments printed on the pad which is why I purchased it. I thought it would be cool. However, the person that posted that he would not take a stick to this pad is correct because I won't either. I have been a drummer for 30 years and if you practice on this you will damage whatever is under it. It is actually a mouse pad that you use for your computer. It should really be advertised as such. That is what I am using it for. I needed a new one anyway and the cost was about the same. LOL!!!"
1,Everything you want,this product does not play in my dvd player becuase it is more than likely recorded in the wrong region.
5,VW Manual,This manual is an outstanding value. It covers the vehicles from top to bottom and addresses any oddities that may be part of a particular version. The pictures are clear and very helpful.
5,The perfect manual,"A little bummed that some important detail are left out in the manual, but it's nothing I cant figure out on my own. Well worth the money."
2,Mono Ena Thavma!,"Music/Lyrics/Orchestrations/Production Nikos Karvelas.A weak Rock album which lacks Anna's Dramatic slow ballads, we only get one here (track 6). Anna & Nikos were and still are ahead of their time with their music. This album did great commercially but is losing it's wit 13 years after it's release."
4,Great for price,"I love the product. They're cheap, so I can mass order them for when my boyfriend looses them all. They do bend a little easier then I would like, but for the price I didn't care. I bought them for something like $2 a pair and its a great buy. I think that might have been on a sale however. If so they should really drop back down to that."
5,Great and authentic movie,Native film makers consider this the hallmark of authenticity and beauty in Native American film making. It's engaging and mysterious. I very highly recommend this movie. It is timeless.
2,not a must see,"I am a bit confused as to why this movie has won so many awards and gotten all this great press. Is it because its a peek into the world of the Inuit? And it was written, acted and directed all by the Inuit? This alone does not allow for any concessions. It is a sincere effort, but its also quite amatuer. The bad guy is really bad and the good guy is really good(almost no character development). the camera work is awkward(cheesy zoom in's on actors' faces when we're supposed to grasp the dramatic moment). the acting stiff. the narrative is strange and hard to follow(all of a sudden he's got two wives!). and the length...yes long, but not really slow, it was neither compelling nor boring to watch. i am however quite interested in what the actors are up to these days. but hey, the movie is not a must see. you can pass this one up."
2,"Typical movie plot, but set in the frozen north","I admit that do not know for sure, but I do suspect that believing that this movie accurately reflects Inuit life would be like believing that soap operas and murder mysteries accurately reflect life in the U.S. I can understand why one reviewer said that the movie is an insult to Native Americans."
3,pretty but small,"My daughter loved it because it's red. (her favorite color) It really works- you have to tune it, it comes with a tuning pipe, pick, replacement strings, everything! But it was much smaller than I had pictured. My child isn't interested (yet) in really learning to play a guitar but wants to pretend with her friends. They laugh because her guitar is so small."
3,"Very ""What color is your parachute-ish""","Lots of the Robin's advice comes straight out of the job hunting bible of the past 2 decades ""What color is your parachute"" by Richard Bolles but still --- It's an excellent primer for the real thing, and summarizes a lot of what Richard Bolles preaches and teaches.Because it is a quick an easy read, I suggest buying it cheap (or take it out of the library (sorry Amazon)), use it to whet your appetite for Bolles books, then begin collecting every edition you can get your hands on of ""What color is your parachute"" (every edition has something new in it). And try to get a hold of the audio book (I think he only put one out in 1995 - I wish he'd put one out every year!). It'll change your life and maybe mine too, cause maybe, just maybe, If everyone were to read Bolles books and truly understand the concepts I wouldn't have to deal with so many unhappy, bitter people at the work place."
1,Good service... Bad product,"Evidently they just don't make a good bath pillow. I decided to give this one a chance since it looked a little more promising than some of the alternatives.Nice packaging and item appeared to be good quality. Worked great until the ""third"" use when the bladder seam failed and it took on water. The bladder contains a cloth type filling, so the pillow now feels more like a bag of rock salt. Aside from the weight, we had concerns of mold and bacteria, so we tossed it."
5,spa pillow,This pillow is just what I was looking for. It works great and came in record time after purchase. It might be a little puffy so just let air out. It sticks on the tub perfectly and makes for a relaxing tub experience! The only minor glich was that it is offered in several colors but when it came to purchasing it was only available in 2. Pink works but I would have perferred another color. If that's all I have to grip about I figure that's nothing!
5,finnaly an ambient compilation worth buying,"Mum, Isan, Solvent, Lali Puna the kings of electronica and few rare finds as well; B. Fleischmann, Ulrich Schnauss, Hermann and Kleine, Icebreaker. It's worth it as an introduction to other great artist you may not of heard of otherwise. Turn it up and ponder the nothingness that surrounds you. Don't get me wrong a few songs just suck."
5,Great TV show with an epic season finale.,"I have been hooked on the Venture Bros for years now. As a Johnny Quest fan in childhood, I did not realize how much I missed ""adventure"" shows until the Venture Bros came on the air. The show has been consistently funny and well-written. It takes a few viewings to get every joke, so the DVD set is worth purchasing to re-watch again and again. I was put off when the creators split up this season, but it's hard to argue with results.My only warning is not to let kids watch during episodes like ""Operation P.R.O.M."" because of the language. It's not censored out on the DVDs, so keep that in mind."
5,"If you want to be more and have more, read this book!","Steven Lloyd has written a book that should be required reading by anyone who wants to succeed in business, relationships, selling or, life! If you want to do more, be more and have more; read this book!"
5,Selling From The Heart is a remarkable book!,"It is so refreshing to read a work from an author that is successful at what he does and has the writing and communication skills and abilities to teach others how to do it too! Steven Lloyd and his remarkable book will take you from theory to practical, from observation to action! This book needs to be required reading for every serious student of sales, marketing, management, and life!"
1,Cell phone Case,Cell case is too small to fit the Motorola V3xx phone as advertised. The V3xx is just a little longer than the rest of the Razor phones. Otherwise this is a fine case.
3,State Standards Deluxe elementary edition,"The questions in the test are very good. And it includes everything for that grade. But it doest not tell you which answer is correct. It said to click the""show me button for the correct answer"", but there wasn't such button in it, and the printing button does not print anything."
2,Fairly slapdash,"I love these guys, but I can see why this date wasn't released for awhile. There are a number of places -- primarily where someone has to come in for a solo -- where they should have just stopped and started over again, but they soldier on, to everyone's embrassment, I'm sure. They also do a little bit too much clowning around for my taste. And it sounds like the tape on the machine stretched here and there.If you're new to this group, get a studio date first. There are plenty of good ones at the top of Amazon's list. I was looking for ""Girl Talk,"" though, and couldn't find it on a studio date."
5,Superb Performance; Don't worry about audience noise,"According to the Tureck Bach Research Institute, the performances on this disk were recorded in the mid-1980s. It is easy enough to tell from listening that these works were not recorded all from the same performance. There is no audience noise during or after the first prelude and fugue or the Aria with Variations. In both cases, contrary to another reviewer, I would say that both the instrument and the recording itself are exceptionally fine. From the Chromatic Fantasy onward, there is modest applause after the works, the audience must of have been very small. In no case does the applause intrude upon the music. From the Capriccio onward the recording quality is very slightly worse, occasionally becoming oversaturated in loud passages. The instrument itself sounds like a good one. In all cases the performances are exceptionally nuanced and characterful. Don't hesitate to buy this one!"
3,"Average, if not a little under.","In reply to a previous review posted by ""Kangarew"" who claimed that the song ""39"" was hardcore and rockin the whole way through...did you even review the right cd? It's not heavy in the least, the music sounds alot like New Found Glory but the vocalist is a lil annoying. This is basically just punk rock at heart, don't expect anything else. Compare it to the likes of Simple Plan, NFG, Yellowcard (who is by the way a notch above the rest) right down the the pre-pubescent sounding singer."
3,"Too Preachy, poor sound quality and expensive","I'm not complaining about Steve's politics as expressed in the songs themselves, but rather, all the preaching between songs on this CD and at his shows. I skiped the Minneapolis show this round because it bores me to no end, especially after standing in a smoky bar for 3 hours plus. I love his music, his band, the Steve Earle sound, and the songs. I just wish he didn't beat the politcal drum to death between songs at the shows too.This CD doesn't sound as good as other live CDs I own like John Hiatt's Alive At Budokans. This should sound better based on Earle's recording experience and great sounding studio records.I can't figure why this CD is so expensive? I hope he is donating some of the profits to something he believes in? I hope Steve will get off the pulpit in his future concerts so I can go and ENJOY THE MUSIC.Honestly, 3 stars is generous for this overpriced CD. Go buy everything he has done like I have."
4,Excellent book,Excellent book for young boys who love football. Our six-year-old grandson loves football on TV and know all the teams and most of the players. He has played one year of flag football and loved it! He was thrilled with this book that explains the terms of football and helps him understand it better. So glad I found it for him.
4,Good overview of football rules,"My 7 year old was very curious about football rules. This book is great. It clearly can't teach every situation, but it's a great starting point."
2,Not scary or creepy enough!,I have to say that I'm disappointed in Mannheim Steamroller who usually make great music. But Halloween compilation isn't creepy enough for me nor does it frighten me in the bit. I would say that the compilation could be best used in schools around Halloweentime for Halloween parties. The two disc compilation is not their greatest work and I would like to have been frightened at least once but all it is creepy sounds but not creepy enough for me. Maybe it's designed for schools during the Halloween season or for Halloween parties in general.I'll stick to their Christmas music. I'm giving this to my school.
2,THIS is Halloween music?!?!,"This may be somebody's idea of Halloween music, but it sure isn't mine. Way too techno-rock to stir up a spooky mood. I purchased this for background music for a Witches Tea, and there's not a single tune on here I can use. I blame myself, because I based my purchase on the description and list of titles - should have listened to the samples! I was hoping for kinda creepy, vaguely eerie, a bit mystical. This stuff is like getting pounded with the soundtrack of a Saturday-morning cartoon. Booming drums, shrill keyboards, swoops and flourishes of jarring music that could not possibly be considered scary or spooky. The only thing Halloweenish about this collection is the song titles. I guess it's probably played well, but since it's not my kind of music, I'm not a fair judge of that. My first listen to Mannheim Steamroller, and likely my last."
3,I prefer her live,"I like the music, but I think her voice has more edge to it when she's live, which I'd have liked to have heard in the CD."
2,Very sophomoric,"Two stars for the voice alone. The writing on this album is very sophomoric. It takes me back to high school. I am a very big Shanice fan but this one should have been left alone or Neicy should have waited for more mature sounding songs. Forget about loving your man and bragging about it like you have a high school crush. This album should have been ""grown and sexy."""
3,She's A Woman Now,"All you really need to know about this record is that the production is current, the VOCALS are excellent and the lyrics are typical. the second half of this CD stands out as being more mature lyrically, wich is a good thing. Good Cd worth the long haitus.."
2,Wake me when it's over,I agree with the previous reviewer: this recording contains about three minutes of musical bliss. The rest of it is self-conscious and belabored.
2,Pio Peep book,"I was very happy when I found this ""Traditional Spanish Nursery Rhymes"" book, since most of the songs were the ones I used to sing to my daughters when they were little. Now that I have a grandson I said to myself, he need to lern that, so I went ahead and purchaded the book and a CD, but for my surprise, there were only 5 songs in Spanish, and then the same ones in English, I was a little disappointed.I wish I can find a CD with all those songs in Spanish, since I want my grandson to learn that language."
3,Seems ok... but poor CD,"I looked the book over and ostensibly, it looks good. but upon further inspection of the CD, I find that the code is EXTREMELY difficult to read with many extranuous tags all over the place. I get a great deal out of deciphering code and when it's sloppy, it becomes very difficult to learn from. Further, even upon coping the contents of the cd to my machine and trying to browse the demo site, it kept having problems finding the data souce. The material itself may be excellent, but the quality of the CD is awful."
3,White Flour and sugar ?,"Whether you'll like this cookbook depends on what you're looking for. If you are eating vegan to be healthier, if you wish to avoid refined flour and sugar, then this book isn't for you. If you want to eat ""veganized"" versions of popular foods in the typical American diet, this might be the cookbook for you. Many of the recipes call for white flour, sugar, or both. This was a huge disappointment to me, as I was expecting whole grain recipes using a variety of different grains and beans. If you want to bake cookies, muffins, scones, and other desserts, this book provides a good selection of recipes.Update: I have purchased ""Appetite for Reduction: 125 Fast and Filling Low-Fat Vegan Recipes"" by the same author (Moskowitz), and I highly recommend it as a source of healthy and tasty vegan recipes."
3,Pretty good but can't eat soy,this had a lot of recipes in it. I can't eat soy or tofu etc. and don't like mushrooms. A lot of the recipes had those in it. The recipes look awesome otherwise. I did not try any so I don't know if they are or not.
3,Not sure what all the fuss is about!,"This book has had a kind of cult following from the start, but as a sturdy, everyday kind of vegan cookbook, it falls short. I've made several of the recipes with really mixed results: the basic pancakes are fabulous, the jerk seitan was so-so for all the effort it took, and the matzo balls made a horrible slurry at the bottom of the pot. I agree with the other reviewers that the desserts are too sugary; and why use all-purpose flour when you can use whole wheat pastry or spelt with the same or better results? Still, there are a lot of inventive ideas in the book, so I haven't totally given up. The black-and-white design is pretty boring, though the photos are good. The authors are funny, but I don't necessarily need comedy when I'm trying to get dinner on the table."
5,Fun book!,"I bought all three of Isa's cookbooks as a package, and along with the recipes, you get plenty of stories, information and advice. It's a big help to someone like me that is new to vegan cooking and baking. I would definitely recommend getting Veganomicon along with it though, that cookbook is awesome!"
4,Excellent although lots of work,"This book provides an abundance of recipes. The ginger cookies are AMAZING. The entrees are very good as well. The only draw back is that if you are trying to make something quick and easy, this is not the book for you. If you want more creative and high quality vegan food, this book is great."
3,"Good, but not great.","This is a good vegan cookbook, but I find when I am looking for a certain recipe, more likely than not, it is in Isa's other cookbook, Veganomican. If I had to choose between the two, it would be Veganomicon without a doubt."
4,"Good recipes, interesting tidbits","for many years I've been using the Moose wood cook book, a vegetarian must have book. this book has a lot of great recipes , which use 'fancier'and ingredients. Most are really tasty with a lot of flavor. Also my husband is quite fond of many of them. The book is a keeper and I'm very glad I purchased it."
3,Politics and Food Don't Belong in the Same Book,"This is a great great book for cooking, but when I began reading it one night after having it sit on my shelf untouched for a few months, I was SHOCKED that Isa would interrupt a great cookbook to place some not very favorable political comments about George Bush. Hey, Isa: you don't want to alienate your readers with your views that have NOTHING to do with cooking. I was very disgusted when I read that and had I known that those comments were in there, I would NOT have purchased the book. Some of your readers were probably very HAPPY that John Kerry was not elected. I will never ever buy a book of yours again.To end on a positive note, the peanut butter cookies are phenomenal."
3,Okay!,"This is an okay book, I've found some recipes that I really wanted to make but still haven't gotten a chance to. I'm so lazy about it lol."
2,only for sugar-tarians,"I'm really surprised this book gets so many great reviews. It just goes to show how far hype and a funny personality can take someone. I love vegan food, but hated all of the savory recipes I made from this book: the biscuits are dry and flavorless, the punk rock gravy tasted too strongly of lemon juice, the sausage crumbles were bland. The bbq tofu was okayish but I already had a much tastier recipe for it and the coconut rice was virtually flavorless. But the worst of the bunch? The veggie burgers. Weirdest thing I have ever tasted, absolutely nauseating. I threw it in the trash. Her dessert recipes ARE very good tasting, but full of sugar and fat. Personally, I prefer desserts that are a bit on the healthier side, with ingredients like whole wheat pastry flour, maple syrup and fruit sweetener. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the author needs to go to culinary school."
2,Not feeling this one...,"Too much sugar & time required to make most of the recipes. Not bad, but not great. The recipes that I have tried were ok, but again, nothing to write home about. If I were to suggest a few vegan cookbooks to a friend this one would probably not make the list."
5,"delicious, CHEAP, & animal-free",isa isn't joking. these simple recipes make a variety of reasonably priced & yummy vegan-friendly meals. my husband 7 i never ate vegan until we got this book & it made it all so simple. get her veganomicon for things a little more complex & adventurous. but by all means do yourself a favor & get a little isa in your life.
4,great tasting food!,"All the recipes in this book are great tasting--I've made about 1/2 of them so far. However, some can be a bit time consuming with many ingredients. A few ingredients are difficult to find. Some recipes are not ""health food"" because they have lots of sugar or white flour/pasta/rice, etc...but they sure taste great! Maybe not an everyday vegan cookbook unless you have an hour or two to cook, but great to use for entertaining. All my non-vegan coworkers are always begging for a taste of my leftovers at lunch."
2,Not so healthy...,"I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews. Many recipes call for refined sugar, white flour, corn oil, etc. Virtually all the recipes contain soy--soy milk, soy cream, soy yogurt, etc.--with only minor mention of fermented soy products. While this cookbook is vegan, it certainly isn't healthy."
2,"Funny and stuff, but the processed meat-dairy substitute to whole foods is kind of too high for mes","I definitely agree with most reviewers: Isa Chandra Moskowitz is witty and engaging as a writer, but the recipes mostly don't do it for me. I thought there were too many American-style ""we don't eat meat or dairy but we just love faux-meat and faux-dairy"" recipes, as opposed to recipes that are equally vegan but are based on grains, legumes, and vegetables.I don't regret having bought the book, but so far, my other vegetarian/vegan cookbooks are getting a lot more use, while this one is looking hip and post-punk on the bookshelf. I probably won't be racing to buy another book by this author."
5,Great recipes and a good read,"I usually don't read a cookbook all the way through, I tend to browse. This cookbook has a unique style. It is chatty, has great tips and the recipes I've tried have come out very well.She uses unprocessed ingredients, and most are easily picked up at some grocery stores and at health food stores.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for high quality vegan recipes and a lot of helpful information."
3,"Very good, but for the collector only...","This is not a five star CD by Rich, it would not be the first choice, It seems to be a darker version of some of his other songs... As a collector of Rich this is not his most creative work, but not bad"
5,Greg Brown - If I Had Known (CD & DVD Combo),"Simple, honest music. This is a perfect CD/DVD to purchase to get to know Greg Brown and his music. The CD provides a nice variety of songs taken from some of his numerous albums. The DVD gives great background of his life, including interviews with friends and family members. The DVD also has some nice concert footage and reveals the nature of the man and his earthy, somewhat mischeivous background and outlook on life."
5,Excellent Fun!,"City Hunter is one of my favorite Korean dramas. It is fun and engaging and you will love the characters. If Lee Min Ho was not in it I would give it 4 stars because I wanted a more explicit ending between the two main characters. He is phenomenal, though, and pushes this series up to 5 stars fo me. Watch it on the many Korean drama websides or Netflix first to get a taste for it. You won't be sorry."
2,ruined by 'soundtrack',"This would be a great overview. As stated before in earlier reviews; I can't understand the choice of the production genius who decided this needed a 'very strident and way too loud musical score'. It renders this great series almost insuferable at times. They should have taken a lesson from the British series ""The Great War"" about WWI. They did it right, light musical score never distracting and fits the mood of the naration."
4,Enjoyable,"I must say, I don't know what veryone wants, this is a very enjoyable album. No, it is not going to ever come close to make the list of best albums ever, but it is enjoyable."
3,Typical Paul,"I always want to hear some new Paul McCartney music. Like any other Paul/Beatles fan I hold out hope for good material. But this all relative at this point - is it not? Paul is a master, so it is easy to take for granted how good some of his material can be. He seems to do much of it with ease. But in the end I just want the visceral ""feel good thing"" from Paul and he scores on a few songs here, but overall this is a typically inconsistent recording. ""My Ever Present Past"" is my favorite song here. The song as well as the whole CD has an excellent sound but there are way too many throwaways for this to be considered worthy of a new purchase. Download the good songs or get a used copy of the CD."
1,These lyrics are so silly,like some attempt by a cover band to try for a hit - yukMama only knows - over and over and over ..... bad
3,The McCartney Sound,"Thought it wasn't his best music to date but I was glad to add it to my collection anyway. Wasn't as rock and roll as I would have liked. A few of his songs reminded me of his early post Beatles days just after the breakup. Maybe that's the problem for me. It doesn't seem to progress away from it. His song Ever Present Past reminded of his Ram album. His song starts out slow but picks up speed later on. The problem for me is I don't find any of his songs memorable like Band On The Run or Let Me Roll It. Maybe if I listen to this CD enough, something will take. It's one of those CD's that you'd want to hear after a hard days work to wind down to. It's not great but it's not bad either."
3,But I will buy the next one.....,"Paul is one of the very few pop/rock writers who can make their style and material seem fresh no matter how many albums they have made. This one is better than most in my opinion. It is a keeper for at least 4 songs. They are just so McCartney. The opener, Dance Tonight is a wonderful happy go lucky tune. Ever Present Past is a song that tends to get stuck in your head and you can't get it out. Mr. Bellamy reminds me of the early 70's stuff of Ram era and Nod Your Head is a great closer. Four really good songs and the rest is ok. I liked 1996's Flaming Pie better, but not much in between."
2,close to the end,"Being a Paul fan, this album is probably one of his worst. More bad than good. Not one really great song of the lot. Just mediocre meandering songs. It's really getting closer to the end, creatively, for good old paul."
5,Fantastic,"Memory Almost Full continues Paul's amazing string of albums that started with 1997's Flaming Pie. This is simply a must own for any lover of good music. Every song is superb. Start with the simple, catchy Dance Tonight (can't get that tune out of my head) and listen all the way to Nod Your Head (take that, Heather) and you have a classic album that ranks up there with his best work. Thanks, Paul!"
2,Tank Almost Empty,"A typical Paul McCartney record. Ambitious, impeccably produced and--sometimes--not very good.Macca's stellar four-album winning streak ends here.I wish I could draw a bead on his albums before they come out so I don't waste money on stinkers. Unfortunately, McCartney is a greater marketer than he is a songwriter. Every new record seems like it's going to be huge.This one starts promisingly enough. Dance Tonight and Ever Present Past are winners. But it's sharply downhill after that. Nothing else is even remotely interesting. I rate this one behind Wild Life, Off The Ground and Red Rose Speedway; in the same range as Press to Play, Pipes of Peace, London Town, Back to the Egg and McCartney II. Less than exalted company.Starbucks should have released Chaos and Creation in the Backyard rather than this.At Sir Paul's age, you have to wonder how much he has left."
4,Another Good One,"McCartney is the consummate song-writer and performer, giving a strong effort on every try. The first 8-9 songs are all polished, melodius creations, starting with the effervesant, ""Dance Tonight,"" through the fine ballad, ""Only Mama Knows."" Worth listening to, as usual."
1,Cannot believe I bought this CD!,"Lazy, pretentious and just plain awful is how I would rate this CD!! The lyrics - inane and comical. The music - uninspired and hollow. I was so disappointed by this hyped up disaster..... Paul, you can do SO much better then this!!!!!"
2,Love Paul...hate the album,"I can be counted as a life long fan of Paul McCartney.After reading the reviews, I expect to be enchanted with this album.I wasn't.The lyrics are somewhat introspective, but the music is mediocre at best.I think from this point forward I'll stick with listening to my Wings CD's."
3,Memory Almost Full,"I love Paul McCartney and I have purchased all his CD's... I hate to say this, but I was a little disappointed with this CD, I don't think it's as good as his other work..."
5,"A fun, upbeat CD","This one is great fun and very catchy. You'll be singing along in no time. The only song I tend to skip is ""Nod your Head""."
4,One of the heaviest albums of the year.,"There is no way around it, Nora has written one of the heaviest albums I've heard this year. Everything about this album is heavy: the guitars, the vocals, the bass, the drums, and the lyrics. The beginning of the first song is so heavy I kept replaying the beginning of the first song over and over. This is also one of the few albums I've heard this year that sustains it's heaviness through the whole album. People who think bands like Creed are heavy need to add this cd to their collection and have their eyes opened. Honest, aggressive heaviness."
4,The Classic of Industrial Design,"Henry Dreyfuss is among the top industrial designers ever, and here he shares many of the experiences from his industrial design projects, many of them dealing with everyday objects that we take for granted.This book gives insight on many of the thought processes involved in the face of the many projects where he had essentially zero direct experience in. His unrelenting focus on ""Joe and Josephine"" -- the human actually using the product -- has resulted in an array of user-friendly products, even before that term was used.He also covers almost anything to do with industrial design, or running an industrial design firm, including starting off, relationships with clients, payment issues, staff management, etc.This book would be interesting for anyone interested in design in general, or even the merely curious who would like to know why some everyday objects are the way they are.An easy and interesting read."
4,Max You Little Devil,"3rd and hopefully not final installment of Peggy Turner and Cobb's Landing. In this outing, Peggy the mayor of this small New England town, is forced by the irrepressible Max, to put aside her own Thanksgiving plans so Max can capitalize on an original Pilgrim Thanksgiving for the tourists. If this weren't enough, Peggy has to deal with the new obnoxious neighbor who is found dead on the village green, Stu's new fiance - which he is afraid to tell his own mother about and her growing love for Ian. I really enjoy this series of books and hope that Kate Borden hasn't stopped writing about the antics of this little town."
3,At The Earths Core,A fairly good movie that enlists a scientist and his assistant to travel to the center of the earth only to have to save the local natives from giant bird like creatures
2,Ineffective Combo,"I bought 3 items from Skin Laboratory: a) Lactic 35% & Glycolic 25% Combination Acid Gel Peel, b) Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, c) Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.I have used each peel for 4 weeks, rest 1 week in between, which is important to avoid sensitivity problem. The result from the combo is the worst. If you have acne, Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel works perfectly. It clears my occasional spots and whiteheads instantly. If you have uneven skin tone, large pores or fine lines, Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel brings about a much more dramatic and noticeable effect."
5,"Soul Blues, Indeed","Half mountain holler, half strangled cry, Junior Kimbrough's was a music in which the elementary components dripped with something deeper. He didn't just restore the hypnotic ramble and hum of classic north Mississippi blues, he gave it a steroid shot with his slow-boiling style and his wide groove. This is a far cry from the shred-manic, soul-deprived garbage which is being passed off as the blues most of the time today. And it's as close to the core of humanness as contemporary blues will ever get without yanking Robert Johnson or Fred McDowell up out of their graves, fitting them with electric guitars, and urging them to let it loose right there with the elder upstart."
5,Her books make me think,"Lizard Wine, like all of Elizabeth Engstrom's stories, is riveting and disturbing. Engstrom gets inside of the heads of even the most twisted characters allowing her readers to explore the darker side of human nature. Lizard Wine is chilling, powerful and thought provoking."
3,I love Bon Jovi but....,"I love the song on here Memory of Us, but I am sorry I just dont care for this Bon Jovi album as a whole. It is way too much country for my taste. Jon and the guys need to get back to their rock roots. Sorry Jon, I love you but please no more country."
4,Bon Jovi does The Jayhawks,"Yeah, if I'd never heard this sound before I may have given it 5 stars, because it sounds very good.However, if you're at all familiar with The Jayhawks, especially the brilliant and criminally overlooked ""Smile"" then you've heard this before.They may call it country in some reviews but others have identified this sound as ""Americana"" and that's what I'm going with. Harmonies, strings, beats and rhythms, it's all here as clear and crisp as Bon Jovi can give it.Go ahead and give it a whirl and, if you like it, listen to ""Smile"" by The Jayhawks also.Nice stuff."
1,Do not confuse this band with the Bon Jovi of the 80's,"I just got this tonight and gave it a listen. I was not a fan at all of Have A Nice Day except for the title track, but I was hoping this cd would sound more of the rocking Bon Jovi. It does not. This is like pop meets country and it sounds horrible. There is not one track on Lost Highway that I enjoyed listening to. Obviously by the 4 1/2 star rating some people like this direction Bon Jovi is going in, but I am not one of them. There isn't really any trace left of the Bon Jovi that put out the amazing Slippery When Wet album. If you like pop/country then this cd may be for you, but if you are a fan of old school Bon Jovi then you are going to be sadly disappointed. The only similarity between 2008 Bon Jovi and 1980's Bon Jovi is the band name."
1,Cheesy,"I had to listen to this out of curiosity. What a waste of time! Bon Jovi and their big hair sucked back in the eighties, and they suck almost as bad as a country band. Won't this guy ever go away? If you want to hear some real rock, try Zeppeln, Purple, Sabbath or Motorhead. If you want some real country, try Johnny Cash, Willie, Merle, Robert Earl Keen, Emmylou, Steve Earle, Billy Joe Shaver, The Flatlanders, etc. There are plenty of good artists in both categories. Bon Jovi is pathetic!! He needs to go back to Jersey and clean some recording studios. Did another reveiwer compare him to Springsteen? Gimme a break."
5,Hasn't come out of the CD player,Excellent listening. I just love this CD. There is not a bad song in the bunch. I highly recommend it
3,"Man, I miss These Days",All I can say is Bon Jovi's sound has traveled far and wide from the way it used to be back in the good old days of Keepin the Faith and These Days.... Jon's voice is nearly an octave lower than it used to be and his accent has changed too. I much prefer to hear the magnificent vocals found on past albums than the average vocals you'll find on this one...
5,Musthave live-CD for true Prince fans,"""Real music for real music lovers""... That's what he says somewhere during the concert. No question about that, the musicians he used during the live concert are impressive. Just as Prince himself. It's pure funk! On the 3 CD's you hear a mixture of jazz, funk, soul and blues where he shows impressive timing in breaks and brigdes. I had this concert in mp3 format for years and it became one of my favourite albums ever. That's why I decided to purchase the original CD's just because it's worth it. The book that's included containes several comments of fans and critics."
1,"Eh, not great.","I needed a white noise machine to sleep. This one is loud enough, but the white noise setting is not at all smooth- you can hear when the loop is repeating. This makes it jarring if you're sensitive to noise when you sleep, which I imagine most people who buy these things are. The maximum volume also varies for each of the sound settings, so some of them aren't loud enough to drown out street noises. The sound quality for some of the settings can be pretty poor- the rainfall, for example, sounds very scratchy and irritating. The running stream suits my needs well enough (loud enough and not too jarring), so I might as well keep it, but I would recommend someone who wants actual white noise to look elsewhere. I don't need the clock or radio functions, but the time is indeed difficult to read from across the room."
2,Clock too bright!,"The product itself is great with a good selection of sounds. I liked the radio on it as well as the 2 different alarm settings (1 for me and 1 for my husband). However, the digital area of the clock has a blue background with black numbers. Most digital clocks are the opposite with a black background and green/red/blue numbers. The difference this makes is that the clock is really bright at night. It has a dimmer switch but it doesn't dim much. And if you aren't right in front of the clock looking at it dead on you can't see the numbers. If you look at it from an angle you can't read what time it is."
1,Failure Right Out of the Box,"Did not work with power adapter. The display would light, but clock would not show and unit would not turn on (no clock, radio or sounds). Did get it to work with batteries, but reverted to failure mode when electrical adapter was plugged in. Returning this one and will not buy again."
1,Worthless,"Ordered first one--could not set time, sound feature did not turn on, returned same. Ordered second one, set time, then moved clock to different room, time would not reset. Sound did work on that one. Returned. Found a different product."
1,Nice Sound Quality but Terrible Display,"Two big problems with the time display: 1. The blue, backlit time display is impossible to read unless you put the clock at eye level in a darkened room. Any other angle, and any light (lamp, natural light from windows, etc) reflected off of the plastic display cover, renders it illegible. You can almost see this in the large product picture. I just bought two of these to use as sound machines for my toddler and newborn and I am willing to overlook flaw #1 but that brings me to #2. The backlit display is BRIGHT. I've used it in my own room the last two nights. I'm not a night light person and I can't sleep with the amount of ambient light this thing produces--I'm writing this review at 3:30 am. Researchers have found a strong link between night light use in children's bedrooms and myopia so I'm uncomfortable allowing these in my babies' bedrooms."
1,Couldn't even get the darn thing to work!,"Even using the directions, I couldn't set the alarm or change any of the sound settings. I was pushing buttons as instructed and getting nothing, or something other than what I was expecting. Maybe I got a faulty one, but I didn't want to take any chances and decided to return the stupid thing. I wouldn't waste my money if I were you. I found it very disappointing."
1,Defective after 5 months - cannot return it,"I loved this clock for the first week, then I started noticing the time would always be either behind or ahead, no matter how often I updated it to sync with any other clock. That did not bother me though because I purchased it mainly for the radio and the sound therapy. Now, 5 months later, the clock goes completely out and it will not turn on at all unless I mess with it for about 20 miniutes. Eventually it will work but it is inconsistent."
1,Makes crackling sound when using sound therapy option,"Makes crackling sound when using sound therapy option. We bought this for sound therapy option and when it is playing sounds it makes loud crackling noises, interrupting sleep!"
4,Seems to work fine & does it's job.,"Bought this for my wife & she's very happy with it. The ""blue glow"" is a bit bright, but the sounds help put us both to sleep & the alarm does, well, what it's supposed to do!"
3,"Lots of sound options, but poor display","This clock has a lot of soothing sound options , but the display is hard to read. I have a tall bed and i could not see the time on the night stand that sits slightly lower than my bed. I have adjusted the brightness and contrast but nothing helps. It works well by my baby's crib for backround noise for her to sleep."
3,Good Product but Too Bright,"This alarm clock / noisemaker has all of the functions I want, but the clock light literally lights up half of my room at night. I have to put something over it to block the brightness."
2,Radio buttons malfunctioned after a couple of years,"I have liked my Conair and would have rated it 4-5 out of 5. However, over the last couple of weeks various buttons on the top have stopped working. The Snooze button, the Off button and 1 of the Alarm set buttons are no longer working. What a shame."
3,ok for a 2 year old,"Once you have had a Marpac nothing compares.....but I didn't want to spend the money for my 2 year old for when the new baby arrived. The white noise is a horrible static sound, but my daughter LOVES the crickets. It is great for kids, just something that I couldn't sleep with."
2,Great night light & sound therapy but AWFUL CLOCK & ALARM,"If you only want sound therapy/ noises to sleep by and a bright blue night light, it is great but AVOID this unit if you want a clock or alarm. The clock is not visible if you sit, stand or lie at various angles and the alarm is not reliable, consistent or dependable. I only kept it for the sound scape and night light and had to buy a separate clock and alarm to wake me up. VERY DISSAPPOINTING!!!!"
2,Need a beacon light? Try this!,"I would have given this product 5 stars for doing what it's supposed to do at a reasonable price, but I gave it only two because of a frustrating design flaw. Even when it's on the ""dim"" setting, the clock is so bright it's beyond nightlight, it's more like beacon light, illuminating the whole room! If you look at the picture, you can see why. Most clock radios have numbers illuminated against a dark display. This one is reverse with the numbers dark and the entire rest of the (quite large) display illuminated shedding WAY too much light for a person to reasonably sleep with.We got this mainly as a sound machine for our daughter who also needs a very dark room to fall asleep, so we're either going to have to return this or jerry-rig something to go over the display to make it dimmer."
2,not good for an alternative sounding alarm,"We liked the sounds this machine had to offer, but unfortunately, you can't use them for the alarm function. There is only one default sound available for the alarm mode--""babbling brook."" Is anyone out there actually pulled from sleep by the sound of a babbling brook? Bird sounds, perhaps...but not a babbling brook. So, we sent it back."
2,nice alarm; operating instructions incomplete,"This is overall a nice alarm, but the instructions did not include any hint of how to set the alarm to any nature sound other than the default of running water. I really would prefer to wake up to the tropical birds, or the crickets and have been able to discover absolutely no way to get it to play that sound when the alarm goes off. (Anyone, help?) That is maddening and is the main reason I'm only giving it two stars. That and the fact that the other reviewers are correct that the display is waaay too bright even on its dimmest setting, yet weirdly difficult to read because of the way it's back-lit. I have to keep mine turned sideways so it won't bother my spouse."
4,great sound maker,"This is a great sound maker. The only thing I don't like is that the LED light is too bright at night, so I have to turn the clock to the other side."
1,Horrible and frustrating!,"After about two months of use, the plug that goes into the machine became loose. I can not turn it on unless the plug is in a very particular spot, which is often impossible to find. I stand over it and twist and turn the plug and most often I get NOTHING! So frustrating. I own the Conair Sound Therapy that does not have a clock radio. It has worked nightly for my daughter for 5 years. Buy that one instead! Save yourself the headache. When it did work, radio reception was iffy and the alarm clock display too bright."
1,Sound not great and can't read numbers at different angles.,"You can't read the numbers from certain angles on the clock feature. It's really bad, like the numbers fade out depending on how you look at it. The sounds were not great but doable. The antenna broke off when I unpacked it. We returned it between the crappy antenna and not being able to read the clock on our night stand."
4,"Lots of options, Good for white noise","We've had this machine for more than two years now and I use it during our son's naptime to block out house noises so he'll sleep well. There are a number of different noise combinations - waterfall, ocean, birds, stream, rain fall, thunder storms, etc. - and he sleeps very well with it. It also has radio functions and a nice long antennae, so you can get better reception.It is small enough to pack up and take with you on trips and the blue clock light functions as a bit of a night light. Unfortunately, you can't really turn the clock light down, so if you're trying to achieve total darkness you'll have to turn the clock face to the wall.Overall, we love it and will continue to use it for quite some time."
1,Loved it UNTIL it stopped working!,"The noise was perfect. It was easy to use. We loved it UNTIL it stopped working. This piece of crap quit working a few days after we got it. None of the buttons would work. We couldn't even set the clock. Quite a disappointment because our 6-month-old had finally started to sleep through the night. All of a sudden, we were left without our magic white noise. Skip this one!"
4,Great for background noise & night light,"I am very pleased with this clock/radio/sound machine. I have it in my girls' room and the ocean waves sound is great background noise blocker. But the display is VERY bright and blue. For the girls it's great because it functions as a night light. Even the dim setting is quite powerful. I wouldn't like it for my room because of the brightness. The clock is not easy to read, even in the highest contrast setting (there is 3 of them). The sounds are repetitive, but that doesn't bother the girls or me/husband (we listen to it through the baby monitor). It's a nice, little egg-shape device that doesn't take much room. Price was right ($17), much less than other sound devices. Great for my needs."
4,Works perfectly,Very happy to have found a sound machine for a good price with many options. We mainly use the white noise option for our baby while he sleeps - oh and we have used the alarm options. Thank you Conair!
3,Too Bright!,"I bought this because my husband hated my need for a box fan (for noise). The white noise is ok, I have adjusted but the display is VERY bright. My alarm clocks have always been black background with lit numbers. This is opposite so very bright. I have to block it from my view which kind of stinks. That is my only complaint."
2,Blue Light is Not Special,"I will cut to the chase. The product designers at Conair have a well designed, good price point product except for one fatal flaw. The blue back light LCD time display not only is difficult to read if you are at the wrong angle but it is too bright and lights up a dark room. If you are thinking about using this in a bedroom at night then be prepared to wear sunglasses to get to sleep. Of course that is an exaggeration but even when using the dimming switch, the LCD is too bright. The change in design from LED digits against a black background (circa 1990's) to what this device has which is a brightly lit blue background surrounding dark LCD digits is a big mistake in my sleepless opinion."
1,Unusable Clock,The blue glowing backlight overpowers the numbers of the clock. The clock is not readable if you are more than 5 feet away. All you see is a blue glow. And that glow is very bright. Basically it is a bright blue night light with sounds.
1,Great radio.,"The radio in this sound therapy machine is quite good. Unfortunately, the radio in the machine that I purchased would not turn off even when the sounds were playing. So, I sent the machine back to Amazon for a refund."
2,It's quite annoying,"I was hoping to purchase this and be relaxed by it. On the contrary, the sounds are quite annoying. The only sound that I was able to get use to and even use is the Thunderstorm one. The tracks repeat about every 45 seconds to a minute. If you can easily pick up on patters or are into music and art, this will annoy you because you will easily be able to pick up on the lack of a full sound therapy track. The blue light even on the ""dim"" setting is very bright and when you pick it up to plug it in it feels like a fisher price toy."
4,For the money,For the money this product does what I expect. The sound quality is not perfect but the louder it is the lesser the quality. It will go off automatically or it will stay on continuously. I use both features as well as the alarm clock to keep my nearly two year old sleeping past our 5:30 wake up time. Soon I will use it to help her sleep through the night time feedings of a new baby. I would buy it again.
1,Not a fan,"I bought this last Christmas to replace a sound machine and an alarm clock we had. The reviews were all good so I went for this one. I wish I hadn't. The alarm clock is a pain to set - you have to make sure that it is on the right setting - sound, buzzer, radio - because if you sleep with the sound machine on and have it set to the sounds it won't wake you! My husband has attempted to set it a few times and gave up. The light from the clock bothers him too. I don't think that's really an issue for me but he's a lighter sleeper than I am. And truthfully, the sounds aren't that great. I guess you get what you pay for and this certainly was a reasonably priced item. I am on the market again this Christmas to replace this one... hopefully my next choice will be a better pick."
3,A Bit Bright,"Purchased this product for the ""sound effects"" and as a replacement alarm. The sound effects worked very well(we like the rain).However,blue dials are way too bright.If you want a night light,you have it with this clock.But,as a bedside clock,its light acts as a blue flashlight.So, I am using it as a sound machine only and covered the face with that old standby---duct tape. The plus side is the quality of the sound is very good,esp.considering the low price."
2,Hard to read settings on face.,"Hard to read settings on face. Sounds are good. Second alarm not reliable has not worked for us, but first one works except settings are illegible even when magnifying glass is used. Price for item was excellent."
3,Serves it's purpose for the price,"The service related to ordering & shipping this item was perfect. Upon reciept, I was a bit disappointed. It is of reasonable quality. If all you need is white noise to fall asleep this will be fine; especially considering that the clock & alarm work well and are easy to use.My disappointment is that there is no earphone jack for private listening. I need the white noise/soothing sleep sounds NOT my husband. The other issues are that the sounds are very similar sounding and there is no sleep timer.Some of these issues are mine for not having read the product description better or asked questions. I have resorted to my CD player again and rather than return this- too much trouble- I have put it on my husbands side of the bed as an alarm clock! For that purpose it works well & is easy to use."
3,so far not so pleased...,"Got this yesterday and was disappointed. The sounds are poor quality, and the brightness of the clock even on low is too bright! Plus from across my daughter's 10x12 room you can not read the led clock laying down. I had to prop it at an angle so it was readable... Crazy!"
1,Not a good buy,"This product is terrible. I currently have a sound machine that I love, but needed to replace. I searched for 2 months for the right machine and was hesitant to buy online- but I could not find one in my local stores.This product is terrible. It claims to have a dim switch for the clock but the light is VERY bright even on dim.Then the alarm clock was quite complicated to set.Then when you hit snooze this device rather than turning OFF your radio alarm and allowing you to snooze, it simply lowers the music waaaaayyy down which was quite irritating! I don't know what it does with the BUZZ alarm function- as I refuse to wake to an obnoxious noise!AND on top of all this, the sounds are terrible. Most of them sounded the same and quite muffled. POOR quality.This is a terrible product that needs to be updated before they put this product on the market!"
4,Excellent. You turn it off and it is already set for the next day.,"I like this clock because I'll turn off the alarm and it's already set for the next day. I like how you can also set back to back alarms (one for 6:00 a.m. and one for 6:30 a.m., for example). Nature sounds are soothing too!"
2,outdated,"i felt that although this book contains a few good tips, overall it was outdated. i would recommend anyone interested in the vidal sassoon way of cutting to pay a little more and purchase a dvd instead. the dvd's are much more in depth and easier to follow and you will get a lot more out of it than this book."
2,Far below the best of Elfquest,"Of course I bought this book, and anyone who's following the Elfquest series will do the same. However, it is one of the weaker volumes. Much of the art is terrible -- the characters are literally unrecognizable, all looking (and acting) like effete children. There are huge holes in the plot, and the story is shallow. I suspect that Forevergreen was written not by Wendy Pini but by someone who didn't really bother to research the universe in which the story is set."
4,Sturdy knife,"I purchased this one to replace a the ""same"" model that I lost after several years of use. Although I thought it would be identical, this one is not as smooth or as well made; not that this is a bad knife and it does cost about 30% less than I paid years ago. It has a sturdy, thick blade with a strong lock so it won't fold unexpectedly. I carry this knife daily and use it for cutting all sorts of things: string, rope, cardboard, packaging as well as lots of stuff that a knife shouldn't be used for and is has held up well. Easy, one-handed open/close. Did I mention sturdy? It is. Never pry with a pocket knife (but this one will open a paint can or poke a hole in the top of an oil can. The pocket clip is well made and functional -- it is removable and although I do not use it I chose to leave it in place. I would rather rate it 3.5 stars, but would likely buy the same model again."
2,gerber knives,I had one of these knives for about 5 years before I lost it. I used to think Gerber made the best knives around but when I replaced my old Gerber knife with one of these I discovered that Gerber was no longer made in the U.S.A. They are now made in Taiwan and the quality has greatly suffered. My old knife would hold a edge very well. This knife will not (a problem I've had with another made in Taiwan Gerber knife I bought). The black teflon coating on the blade wore off rather quickly and the round end on the thumb stud fell out. On the plus side it did last me 5 years and I'm pretty hard on knives. If you want my recomedation skip this knife and buy a Kershaw. Kershaw is made in the U.S.A. and the one I carry now seems to hold an edge very well.
5,Great Value,"I am old enough to have purchased some of the original JBL reference speakers, (either $1000 each or $1000 for the pair), but what I loved is ' the clear sound', that makes you think you are setting in the audotorium.The JBL spot speaks have that same quality, and for $100, this is a 'must buy'.In addition, they happily connect to my IPOD, PC, or any other source that I can find. Great product."
3,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of the Jesse so when I seen this come out I had to right out and buy it, but I was very dispointed in it. You get a chance to build what they built on the tv show but it;t not like what you would think. It's basically more of a memory game. You go in order parts and have to remember what all parts that you need. It was really a little lame if you ask me and not much fun. I guess if you was a younger generation it might be apealing and a little fun, but for an adult I can say it was not worth buying."
3,Involving if over-extended,"Though fans of BP may be underwhelmed if going in with high expectations, this all but encompasses hip experimental jazzy background music."
1,Deisgn Flaw?,"This item was packaged and sent to me with 8 horizontal bars of the same length. Just looking at the photo can tell you that the bars on the bottom (the towel rack portion) need to be longer then the bars at the top creating the shelf. The instructions seem to indicate the bars are of the same length. When I spoke with Polder they said that all the bars were to be of the same length. I clarified if the curved supporting bars were curved towards each other, to which I was told no. To make a long story short, it is physically impossible to piece together the product as show in this photo with what I was sent. I doubt I will be buying from this manufacturer again."
1,STAY AWAY from this pan!!,"At first, I was really excited about this pan! Until about 2 weeks after buying it and following the instructions EXACTLY for cleaning and cooking, I noticed a 1 huge chip and several smaller ones in the non-stick coating, exposing the light metal underneath. It looks like peeling paint! Speaking of which, the handle is cheaply painted with black paint which is also cracking and chipping off. This is a toxic pan, avoid at all costs...now I have to spend time trying to return it. Not worth the low cost at all."
3,"Good quality, but a small and strapless.","Case is of good quality materials and construction, but is smaller than I expected from the photo. It does fit the FZ7 camera easily, but if you need a single case for your camera, lens hood, battery charger, manual and cables, you'll have to look elsewhere.Case also does not include its own strap. I was able to place the camera in the case such that the camera's own strap could be used for toting the combined camera and case. However, when it is time to take photos, you have to have to keep track of where you placed the case. The case does have a belt hoop as an alternative, though I will not likely use it.Overall, for the price I expected a bit more."
4,"the ""compleat"" hebrew dictionary","dictionary is truly outstanding; has both modern hebrew & biblical hebrew; many unusual words evident; truly only negative is price, and likely may be excessive for majority of users"
5,Quick Shipper!,"The product came as described, and really quick. I am stationed in Italy, and I had this in my hands in a week!"
3,Ok but there are better books by this author,"We didn't find this book very amusing, actually it's our least Mary Murphy book. probably for an older child it makes more sense, but not too much for a 2 year old."
5,Constantly in my CD player,"Great songs, wonderful pop song production, beautiful harmonies. I just bought this CD, and at 52 years old, I'm embarassed to say that I didn't know just how good The Hollies were. Certainly very near the equal of the Beatles, before they got all ""important"". This collection has all the classic ""first Hollies"" songs, before G. Nash left and they went all MOR in the very late sixties/early seventies - which is exactly what I wanted. That means no ""Long Cool Woman"" or ""He Ain't Heavy"". If you favor those songs, you need another collection. My one regret is that ""King Midas in Reverse"" is not on this CD. Can I subtract a quarter star for that? Now I have to buy the King Midas reissue as well - which I'm sure I won't regret."
1,Didn't ship to correct address,"I do not know how this product is since I did not receive it. I went back and had to change my address in the order and the click on the ship to this address did not click properly so this and two other CD's went to an address that I have changed now twice with amazon, I will probably not be ordering from them after this."
2,Not that great in my opinion........,Not impressed........I donated to my local library not anything special. I would not recommend just so so!~ I actually find Native American flute music to relax me the best. every one is different you might like it. Just not for me!~
2,"He was good, once...","I remember when this guy could give Frazetta a run for his money. Then he became less interested in the art and more concerned with the models - perfectly-muscled men and women who are barely altered from the obviously contrived bodybuilding poses he photographs them in. These characters are more at home on a contest stage than fighting fantastic creatures. Also, his overuse of earth-tones in his paintings of the last 10 or so years is horrible. Everything looks bland and uniform; nothing catches the eye anymore. I wish he'd get back to producing work that had atmosphere instead of churning out piece after piece for his calendars."
3,Comprehensive look at the folks that settled Riviera Beach,"The author did a good job of interviewing many of the old-time settlers of Riviera Beach. Being one of the many grandchildren of Alborn and Alice Moree, it was a pleasure to read about events and places that they experienced early in their lives. Places and stories handed down to the family over the years. The book attempts to capture some of the true flavor of the accent and life-style of those first families, and does it pretty well. Also of interest is the portion of the book discussing the families' history in the Bahamas, and how the search for good fishing harvests brought them to Singer Island. Imagine buying land on the East coast of South Florida for $5.00 a lot! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in an accurate look at life in a Florida beach town of the early 1900's. The accompanying pictures are also wonderful!"
2,"Too much talk, not enough trucks",Gave this as a gift. Just watched one of the set. Seemed like too much time on the hosts and not enough time showing the big trucks.
1,"""God did it""","Has anyone asked the authors who the ""intelligent designer"" is? It is totally disingenuous of them to say that their definition of ""intelligent designer"" is not God, when I can't think of who or what else it might be. But I guess it could be the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or Zeus. As others have said, intelligent design is just creationism in a cheap tuxedo."
1,Usual creationist dishonesty,"For those of us already used to the dishonesty of those who adhere to a literal interpretation of the Genesis, Of Pandas and People contains no surprises. It's nevertheless always intriguing why people in this group seem to have an irresistible drive to attempt to establish their beliefs on a scientific footing. This gives an idea of what their human and religious statures are, for two reasons: First, they think nothing of lying, in order to push their agenda (as clearly illustrated in this book, as pointed out by other reviewers), and second, their faith seems to be so flimsy that they desperately crave for the confirmation of science. Instead of focusing their energies in propagating falsehoods, maybe they should ask themselves about the reasons that underpin the weakness of their faith."
1,IS THIS BOOK FLUSHABLE??,Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon came up with a good substitute for bathroom tissue. This is the sort of BS the creationists wants to introduce in our Public Schools. To fully understand the motivation behind this book please read Creationism's Trojan Horse by Barbara Forrest & Paul R. Gross.

1,Pseudoscience,"This book is pseudo scientific attempting to create the illusion that evolution is scientifically unsound. It is not only completely wrong when it expounds on evolution, it is a malicious attempt by fundamentalists to undermine what they see as against their beliefs."
5,Goo Live in Buffalo,"I love their live music--it has just as much energy as the recorded stuff; I am a big fan (disclaimer) but I was not disappointed at all with this album. Love the fact they did some of their older stuff also. My only regret was I could not make the concert that day-I am a local, but the DVD was great consolation!"
5,"Powerful, Well Honed Reading","From the opening fanfares of the Chicago brass to the quiet ending an hour and forty minutes later this is one powerful Mahler 3rd. I think Haitink is at the height of his powers here. The whole Chicago Symphony Orchestra plays so well that it is hard to believe that it is a live performance. There is no audience noise that I could pick up upon first audition. This CD is a winner in the CSO Resound label.The Mahler 3rd is the longest symphony in the regular repetoire of symphonies. It is the last symphony that Mahler completed completely in the 19th century. It is grandiosomania to the nth degree. It is one of my favorite Mahler symphonies. Lengthwise he would write no symphony longer. Only the 8th would be ""bigger"" and only because of the number of performers. I have a hard time qualifying the 8th as symphony to boot. So it is the 3rd that is largest of large statements by the composer of megasymphonies! RECOMMENDED."
5,The Real Story of Suffragists,This book was a tremendously interesting read. We all remember the stories in high school history class about the Suffragettes marching with placards to secure the vote for women. What we didn't learn was how horribly they were treated and that it took 72 years to secure the vote. This book should be read by every high school girl so that she realizes what these women went through to make sure voting is a right for women as well as men.
4,Great for teaching women's suffrage,"Great book with primary sources to teach intermediate elementary students the history of women's suffrage. There are a few minor moments where subjective language is used to paint a picture of certain historical figures, but otherwise a fair and intriguing read for parents and students alike."
5,LOVELY STUFF !!!!,"I have all the Siddartha CDs, and this one is good just as the 2 parts before of this. Is very very very very goooood music. Recomended."
3,A mediocre social history,"Richards is a physician at Cambridge, not a social historian. So although he could expound at length on the etiology of Mycobacterium leprae, his attempts at historical reconstruction of the leper settlements of Scandanavia-- a fascinating topic-- smacks of undergraduate thesis. The book does provide a glimpse into the life of these poor outcasts, but the reader is left upon finishing it with a desire for a full portrait, not just a glimpse. I would still recommend it, but in conjunction with other, more well-researched works."
3,Easy for the whole family to play,"This game is a hit with my three boys 10, 8, and 6. I had been looking for games we could play as a family that wouldn't be too boring for the older one, or too frustrating for the youngest one- and this one fit the bill. Essentially you look at a card with a picture of blocks and then try to recreate the picture with your blocks in the allotted time. It can be played quickly and requires no reading at all. The boys think it is great fun, but I wish there were some more challenging cards, or maybe even a more advanced set of cards to use for the grown-ups."
5,Awesome!,I purchase this toy as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter.....had a large gathering for the holidays everyone loves it including her!
3,"Great subject, subpar delivery","While the subject of these poems, the freedom of the old-style cowboy, is certainly an interesting one, the poetry itself did not grab me. At times the rhyming sequence seemed a bit forced and the rhythm artificial. The old-style cowboy led a very difficult life; there was dirt, extreme weather, the danger of Indians and loneliness. Yet, it was a life with a great deal of freedom, to many the open land and the stars are great company. McGrady captures that aspect of the cowboy's life, just doesn't say it all that well."
1,The world has gone mad.,"As a previous reviewer has mentioned, anyone who would write such a book has serious issues with understanding the difference between fantasy and reality. Please, join the 21st century and leave your Inquisition attitudes in their own times."
4,this is so sad,i cna't believe connor and liz don't get 2gether. they were great 2gether. i reread all of the scenes of them 2 2gether. i was hopin they wud kiss in senior cut day. they were the best relationship ever. i hope pascal brings him bak and sweet vally BETTA have not ended. i live 2 read these books. i am so depressed i want dem 2 b 2gether(god im sad)
3,sounds great if you're stoned,"That may sound harsh, but its true. Its very rock'n'roll. Every song refers to love and blood. Which is cool i geuss, but kind of gets old since pretty much every song has no real new sound. Just old rock riffs done the Flesh Eaters way. Highlights would probably be 'House Amid The Thickets' which has an awesome (and original) sound. 'Salty Black Water', 'Evil Flower', 'Nobody Lives Forever' and 'Mourning Becomes You' Are also really good. So if you're a kid who just loves rock'n'roll and smokin' pot... well this is the cd for you."
2,too tiny,"The type is so tiny in this slender volume that I can hardly see it. With a magnifying glass, the phrase book can be helpful."
4,A tense and edgy adventure,"Anne Stuart breaks the rules and does it well. While she has been criticized for creating unrealistic scenarios, I think her characterizations hit the mark particularly when they concern heroes like Bastien Toussaint. He's close to the real thing even though that might be hard to take for readers accustomed to more ""romantic"" protagonists. As for Chloe, once again I think Ms. Stuart gets it right in her depiction of an average young woman thrown into shocking circumstances outside her control. ""Black Ice"" may stretch the genre but I think that's a good thing."
2,Just couldn't warm up to Black Ice,"This was my first Anne Stuart book. I'd read that she tends to write alpha-jerk heros and doormat heroines, which is actually okay by me! I cut my teeth on Linda Howard books, and she is notorious for these sorts of characters. I was sort of hoping Anne Stuart might deliver a similar level of emotional involvement and chemistry between the leads, but I simply didn't care about Chloe or Bastian. Linda Howards heroines (though often doormats!) always have redeeming qualities: a sweetness, spunk, or cleverness that makes me want to root for them. Chloe seemed dull, shallow, and frankly, a little mean. Bastian was a blank stereotype who I never believed had any real interest in Chloe. So this book just didn't work for me on the romance level."
3,Pass It Up,"Let me start by saying Im an Anne Stuart fan. This book however, is just too extreme. The female hero is too young for the adventure the book put her in. She's barely likable. The male hero though conciderate to Chloe is too dark with very little in redeeming characterist. Finally, the violence of the book was just too much, even for a fiction novel."
1,Sony / Logitech USB Headset for the PS2,They're both junk and work fine at once but over time they stop working or break. Get yourselves a GameTalk its made by Datel. Its cheaper and lasts longer.
1,Failed after 2 Months,"Well, After 2 mos. this headset has failed. In games, the mic icon shows up with no response from headset. Apparently, after reading dozens of blogs/reviews, this headset will either FRY your PS3 or get FRIED BY your PS3. It will eventually just stop working and is not compatable w/a PS3. Most of the the reviews I read are less than 3 months old and from people who say,""It's working great"", so, a true objective opinion is not available...unless of course yours is FRIED...like mine...After 2 mos."
2,Total Junk,"Note: I don't own a PS2, I bought this for a cheap USB headset for my computer.This headset is really bad. The build quality is a joke; I was afraid I was going to break it taking it out if the packaging (incidentally, the packaging is quite solid). The plastic is cheap and flimsy.Besides the low quality build, this thing is tiny, clearly designed for a little kid to wear. I adjusted it as big as it would go, and while I got it on my head, the fit was light years from satisfactory. Even for people with smaller heads, it only adjusts on one side, so if you adjust the size the headset becomes lopsided.The sound quality is also very poor. While it noticeably cancels some noise, the remaining signal is scratchy, and generally low quality (though not as bad is the build quality)."
5,Best one out there,"For the price, this is just the best headset you are going to find. If you step on it, its going to break, no different then stepping on any thing else. Has a volume control and mute button. Just get it!"
1,Headset 90% of the time DOES NOT work.,"This thing is a mess. My PS3 barely identifies it most of the time,and its a struggle to make it work. Every time I plug it into the PS3,and go to accessory settings to choose my input device,it is not even listed as an option. 10% of the time,it may appear,and I can chose it. And when that does,it works great.However,for $25 that is a really,really bad deal. You would be wiser to spend your money on the Sony one,and avoid this shoddy work of material. Maybe I got a dud,I don't know,I just thought I'd warn you.My opinion: Avoid. Avoid. AVOID."
1,It really sucks!!!,I bought this item brand new only last week and tried it to my new PS3 because im so excited to talk to my friends while playing Resistance:Fall of Man....to my suprise this item does not work at all thou the power is on but i cant hear them......im planning to return it back and probably switch to HBH-610a bluetooth...
5,Even us kids dig it,My pops has known George for a few years and always told me about how great a guy he is and how wonderful of a writer he is. Well pop was reading this book and laughing so I had to see what was so funny. I could not put this book down! I laughed harder when reading A Jew than I do when I read Mad. I cant belive how much I can relate to George and he grew up like like in a different time than I. I honestly felt like I wanted to be there to help this pour kid out and save him from the bullies in his life. You cant help but fall in love with this poor kid and want to be his savior. George you need to write more!!!
5,what a book!,When i started reading it i seriously could not put this book down. It has everyhting needed to be the perfect book. When reading this book you really have to feel bad for George Tabb. He was beat up every day on the bus jsut for being Jewish. His dad was horrible too him( when he played on the baseball team his dad would only buy one shirt for him and his brother). He was even beat up by a blind kid (he wouldn't hit him) and people thought he was making everyhting up. He was punched in the face just for defending a retarded kid. George Tabb is in Furious George a really punk band.
1,Returned due to poor info,"This product does not have a label that describes the uses pitched in the info about the stuff. Nothing about proper mixes to meet advertised uses. That worried me, so I sent it back."
2,It was not worth for the price I paid.,They talk much about this product but it was not worth for what i expected and the price I paid for. It is expensive and does less.
3,This one is all about the Supernatural,"I wasn't a huge fan of this one. I liked the first book because of the characters and the overall plot of the book. The one thing I would have changed about it was actually making it ""horror"". None of the deeds or consequences of not doing the deeds were frightening or really that bad. In this book they change that, but they also bring in this whole backstory to the man they hit in the road in the first book, and bring in satanic cults and weird stuff. Just not my cup of tea, and should have been left out OR should have been included in the first book to not have it so ""out there"".On top of that, the characters were really annoying this time around."
4,Promises to be a good series.,"I bought this book because I loved Parkinson's ""The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower"". I wasn't disappointed. The character is believable and the situations authentic. Good action. Starts slow but promises to be a good series."
2,"Personally, I didn't like these condoms. They were ...","Personally, I didn't like these condoms. They were very dry and uncomfortable. They also felt as if they'd break. I wouldn't purchase them and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I liked the fact that they include spermicide, though. I like the Trojan brand, just not this particular product."
4,This product felt like I didn't have anything ...,"This product felt like I didn't have anything on. It felt natural. It held up well during performance. And it didn't seem to bother the other person either, so I'd recommend these condoms for others to enjoy also."
3,Overlaps with Foonberg's other books,"The information in this book is good, but all of the important parts are also contained (almost verbatim) inHow to Start & Build a Law Practice, 5th Edition (Career Series / American Bar Association). The best thing the author has to teach in either book is client psychology. He bases the advice in both books on empirical surveys of client satisfaction conducted by the ABA. If customer service is your goal, Foonberg's your man. However, his other book is a much better bang for your buck, especially since this one went out of print."
2,"Coby PMP7040 7"" TFT Portable Player","Great picture, but I puchased this unit because it claimed to play mp4's! It doesn't play mp4's!!! It plays avi's beautiful, but does not know the mp4 file type. If you don't mind converting your movies to avi, or that is the file type that you have... than this is the player for you."
4,Great for DIYers,"This integrates your single din radio quite nicely into the space, albeit seamlessly. That pocket is rather useful for storing the cable connector for one's iPod, though you need to saw a hole into it, especially if the radio's connection for said cable is in back."
2,"Good Quality, does not fit my vehicle.","I have seen and installed many single DIN mounting kits that were cheap and flimsy. But this one seems more sturdy than some. The price was really good as ones like these I have seen were double the price or more. However, it does not fit my 2000 Chrysler Cirrus LXI. The kit itself does not fit the parameter of the opening and I was really disappointed. The manufacturer should be more specific as to what models it fits, not just the years and makers. I give it two stars only because I can't say I like it because I can't use it. Although its construction quality seems good its lack of specifics to vehicle match description list from the manufacturer keeps my rating lower. Would I buy another kit from this manufacturer? Yes but knowing whether it will fit might be risky."
2,Not the best fit,"Installed in 2005 Ram 1500. Exterior looks fine. The ISO mount didn't work, radio slid in; but the bracket snaps were too loose to keep the radio locked in place. The actual spot to mount the cage for the radio is to far back; the radio is inset in the dash now and smacks up against the defroster vents. The bezel insert was loose and useless."
4,radio mount,very nice mount. Easy to install. The radio has tabs that are bent out to lock into the mount. This makes it all secure and rattle free.
1,Horrible,I received this clock and the hour hand was broken from the center post that turns it. Very poor quality
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:This volume is full of illustrations that will energize preaching, teaching, or writing. Special features make the entries easy to use:clear arrangement by topicexpanded alternate subject listingseasy-to-use indexspace for recordsthe right to copy"
2,"Good watch, terrible heart rate monitor","As a runner I have to say that the Timex Ironman Watch was a real disappointment. This product is totally overrated (I really don't know how they got the authorization to put the Ironman logo on it, since it does not even work correctly under easy training conditions). If you are serious about running/exercising/competing and looking for a good heart rate monitor watch to control your performance, you better look for another product. It ramdomly goes crazy while training and/or competing, chest strap is too tight and watch size is perfect for small women or skinny guys, not real men."
1,Worked well... when it worked,I bought this monitor in January when I started spinning classes in addition to step aerobics. Worked well and had all the features that I wanted. But then it suddenly stopped working in May. Under warranty I contacted Timex. It took 5 weeks to finally get a new working watch and chest strap. Then the chest strap broke in September in a way that is unfixable. I give up. I'm looking for a Polar.
2,inconsistent,"My wife and I both purchased one of these watches, and neither one kept accurate heart rate information. My didn't work at all, and my wife's is inconsistently working/not working. I like the features but wish the heart rate monitor was more reliable."
5,Attitude Adjustment,This film adjusts your attitude as to what is important and what isn't in life! I enjoy the film very much!
5,My son ordered this for me. 4 stars!,This is a truly inspirational video that gives wonderful insight into what makes people really happy. My son got it for me & what perfect timing. It certainly is uplifting! I highly recommend this video! I even ordered one for my best friend & she enjoyed it also.
2,On second thought,"After watching this video which had a leaning toward the happiness of communal life, I could only think of the recent case last year of the suburban mother of 3 young children who waked out on her husband and children to join an OWS commune and has not seen them since. I guess she is experiencing ""personal happiness"", but for me it brought a misconception in their thesis. Not as overwhelmed as some by this presentation."
1,this book sucks,Read your DAW's instruction manual better than this book .there are dozen of book like this .this book don't tell you nothing about sequencing techniques .however author's another book MIDI Orchestration is excellence and really tell you midi sequencing techniques .
2,Way Over Priced,I bought this book for close to $43.74 ($39.74 + $3.99 shipping)and when it arrived it was marked $19.99 on the cover.Very annoyed!!!Will not be so quick to order again>
3,Too many odd spices and ingredients,"The recipes in this book look really good. It is a beautiful book. However, too many require unusual spices and ingredients for the ordinary cook. On the other hand, some of the recipes do use everyday ingredients.Many of the recipes also require the use of a blender or food processor. That involves extra steps and cleanup.Also, I was under the impression that whole wheat pastas had a lower GI index than regular pastas, and she doesn't use these in her recipes.What I needed was a low GI cookbook with ordinary ingredients and simple recipes."
5,Low GI Recipes are TASTY!,I found the recipes in here VERY manageable and delicious. It has been such an easy transition to this new eating style and these books that were recommended by my Dermatologist have been an excellent source of information and reference. I will definitely purchase the other GI books that relate to my current conditions!
3,"good info, so-so recipes","I like the information on GI and that part of the book is really informative and helpful. It's not packed full of recipes I would use. I ordered a second book also part of the GI diet Called The GoodCarb Cookbook by Sandra Woodruff, it's much better. Still good GI info and packed full of recipes that my family will eat and many are easy to prepare. It even has good desserts, so for the best cookbook I recommend the sandra Woodruff book."
2,"The Low GI Diet Cookbook: 100 Simple,",I did not like most of the recepies that were in the book. They were too exotic for me. A couple of the desert recepies were ok and I did like the color pages that showed the food.
4,Great,"I purchased quite a few russian courses being determined to learn it. This includes the penguin course, the CD based courses by both rachel farmer and the one by daphne west, and this one. Of the CD based courses, so far I like this one the best.I must say that I have really enjoyed this course to date. I have not completed it yet, but it is a great way to build one's russian vocabulary to the point where you could converse and get around in russia. The included manual contains the english and the russian cyrillic which I find helpful so as to see how the words are spelled in russian.At least in the early lessons, there is not much addressing proper grammar, as russian grammar is different than english, but I think that this is addressed to some extent in the later lessons. I am using the penguin text as well to supplement this and they do complement each other well."
1,Not a course. Just a reading of a Russian-English dictionary,"If you or someone you know is interested in learning Russian, and you want to kill that passion, this is an ideal package to purchase. Not only has this course made me less interested in Russian, its made me less interested in life in general. It's honestly that bad."
2,Fact or Fiction?,"Man, i just love those murder theory books...one more outlandish than the next...and they are everywhere!!This Book is at it's best when it's talking about ""something's got to give"". The rest is based on some serious hear-say, dubious ""mystery"" sources and claims of second hand witnesses. The likes of Robert Slatzer and Jeanne Carmen pop up a lot in this....doesn't exactly inpire trust in the truth. This Book is sort of like reading ""the national enquierer"". It's entertaining, sure...but how much is inflated?"
1,Garbage,"This is the most ridiculous piece of literature I have been subjected to read in my life! I know this Bonnie Hayman, she is a gold digger! Her daughters are beautiful girls, don't penalize them! Bonnie, however, is writing this book on my fathers grave! She is not a divorced woman, yet, a widow! A widow? Yes, she is a widow. Her husband had three children, now, this is not fiction, one named Greg, whom she had met, and subsequently tried to seduce, one Jason, and one Jeff. Of all, jason took he brunt of everything. He was the survivor. It wasn't his fault!!!"
3,There wasn't a noticeable difference between these condoms ...,"There wasn't a noticeable difference between these condoms and a good latex condom. Also, these condoms, like other natural membrane condoms, don't provide protection against STDs and HIV. I probably wouldn't recommend these condoms to friends and family."
5,all around good time,"you want to listen to music while you work, while you drive, while you buy junk on-line...this is a great album for all of those things, but what's more is that it's a great album to LISTEN to. that's right, LISTEN. if you pay attention you'll hear another cool tidbit everytime! the overall vibe is great & fun, but the music is in the details...these guys know what they're doing"
1,Wow! What a piece of crap.,I consider myself to be an intermediate PS user but I wanted to take my skills to the Pro level and I thought this book would do it. Boy was I wrong!Just because you are an expert in PS doesn't mean you know how to write a tutorial based book about it. This book is so badly written I feel like I know LESS than before I started! There is no order in this book. The tutorials are not laid out in an organizes step-by-step manner. Each page is crammed with so much text the reader doesn't know where to start.This book has some amazing pictures of what can be accomplish in PS but unfortunately the reader is left wondering how the heck do I create that? Save your money and search for better tutorials online instead.
3,Good book for beginners but make sure you get one INCLUDING a CD,"This is a very useful little book, easy to read, however, don't make the mistake I did. I bought a ""like new"" edition that didn't specify whether the cd was included or not (I assumed if it was like new it would) and there are many exercises in the book that rely on images contained in that cd, as well as plug ins for your photoshop 7 for your computer.If you get the book, be sure to get an edition with a disc."
4,needs to be larger format,"Good writing combined with straight forward information is a hallmark of this series of books.However my continued observation is that this needs to be printed in a larger formatto make it an easier read.Just being crammed full of relavant information and good instruction isn't enough, I put off reading this book because it was somewhat difficult to get through with the smaller typeface used.Photos in examples used could be larger as well, though many examples are included on the CD-Rom that comes with the book I can only give this book 4 stars.Change the type size, insert larger photos and it is a 5 star book."
1,This is digusting !!!,"Just when I thought Kidz Bop was as bad as it could get, DJ kid proved me wrong. now, I know this is aimed at younger kids, but its still pathetic. I srtongly reccomend ""Disneymania"" for fans of hip,bouncy songs....by singers who can actually SING !!!"
2,This is *not* whisper quiet,"I bought this fan to quiet down my older, white Xbox 360 while watching movies. The factor fan screams of course, and my hope was that this fan would make the Xbox nearly silent. Unfortunately, there's almost no difference between this fan and the factory unit. Read the product details carefully - it's only advertised to be 7% or 3 decibels quieter, not much of a difference. I'll be looking for another option to quiet down my Xbox as this didn't do the trick."
2,My problem with my fan,"i bought this fan hoping it can really do its job but it didnt... first of all i tried to plug this seperate piece that goes with the fan and it was really hard. when i pluged it in only 1 side worked and spent over a hour trying to see what i can do i gave it to my neighbor to look at he did a minor fix to it and both sides worked. i was happy but after a hour of playing time i felt my xbox it was really, really hot its now maybe as strong as the stoke fan except i paid $20 just to add blue led lights to it... im hoping to return it for another new one but the paper i was given said i couldnt return it for full refund if used or out of the box. i hope i can return my defective fan and get a new one... so thats a problem i had to all of you buys."
2,Not a very good fan,"It looks nice & It really did pull in more air for my Console, but later in the night that I installed it, One of fan blades stopped working. So Blehh on this item."
4,This would make a great video game or cartoon!,A fun book about the future of motorcycle racing. Could this be the new world?
2,The Staircase,"It wa the wrong DVD. I wanted the Staircase with William Peterson. I coudn't undertand why it was so expensive when I ordered it, but realized when it came that it was the wrong one. I was going to return it but then was able to give it to somone else for a present at Christmas.sta=ircawe"
2,A Bit of a Turn-Off,"I, too, was enthralled by Anne Labastille's ""Woodswoman"" and eagerly bought the hardcopy of this book when it first came out. I have to say I found it a bit of a turn-off. Her reasons for moving father back in the woods gave me the same feeling I get whenever I see gated communities: as if the people living in them consider themselves too special and elite to associate with us common folk. I haven't bought any more of the author's books since."
1,Awful!! Misleading Product Description!!,"I was very disappointed about this order. The product description is hugely misleading. The web page shows the product, titled ""Trojan Condoms Trojan Ribbed Lubricated 3 Pack Condoms"", with a picture showing a pack of 12 condoms. This makes customers think that the seller will send 3 packs of 12 condoms (36 pieces in total), but they have sent only 3 pieces (~$3/piece) in a small package. I was hugely disappointed in this order and got an impression that the seller is dishonest. They need to correct this problem immediately. Don't trust them!!"
2,Weakest Effort To Date,"After listening to TCOL, I want to up all my other KC ratings (except those that are a five already) to be in proportion with this one, and to remind myself just how good those records are. One of the most dissappointing CD's I've ever purchased, too needlessly harsh. It makes me appreciate just how varied and wonderful Thrak was.This is not without it's moments though, there are a couple good Beatlesesque vocal moments from Belew, but I don't know why his voice needs to be run through some crazy effect on every song, especially Prozakc Blues, which I don't ever need to hear again.Larks Tongues IV is pretty good as is the title cut. Heaven And Earth just sounds like an outtake, not even good enough for bonus track material. Too many of the tracks just seem to go nowhere, even though they may have began as a good musical idea. Most Crimson material sounds better live, but it's tough to say what that will do for this album.The departure of Bruford and Levin really hurts too."
4,Great 80's brand Crimson,"Though the first track on this album is iritating at best the other tracks are great. The album is not up to par with ""Dicipline"",or one of their best 80's albums, ""Absent Lovers"", but it's almost as good as ""Beat"". If this makes any sense to you, your a Crimson fan. Buy this CD. It rocks."
3,The product worked as it was supposed to. ...,The product worked as it was supposed to. The lubrication helps to not lose the mood. The ridges weren't all that great for my wife.
4,Needless to say Trojan is probably the leading ...,Needless to say Trojan is probably the leading brand in condoms. This product leaves you with no wonders why.
5,Awesome,"I think it's just as good as the first album, if not better. I have been listening to it for 3 days straight now and I absolutely LOVE every track - especially ""Better That We Break"", ""Won't Go Home Without You"" and ""Kiwi""."
3,Like the Police?,"I won't say this album is 5 stars for the simple fact that I doubt it will be enduring. I decided to purchase the album after hearing Makes Me Wonder. I don't know if I am the only one who thinks this way, but this album sounds real similar to the Police; too similar for my tastes. Most of the tracks are decent however I tend to pass over they tunes where Adam goes into detail about how sexy he is. I could care less about that, and it seems that he wants to remind me about it constantly. I prefer lyrics with a little bit more meaning to them. Regardless of how sexy he is, the album has some fun tracks that are worth playing at parties and while you drive around town. Just don't let Sting hear them."
4,Over Produced but Solid.,"This album doesn't come close to ""Songs about Jane."" The new disc is washed, scrubbed and polished to the point where you just want to hear some raw emotion out of Levine's voce but you never do. But instead what you do get is smartly written, smarmy pop gems that is still better than most of anything else on the radio these days.All over the disc you get snippets of other artists that have influenced them and that mostly comes from the 80's. You get a Prince tune: ""Kiwi,"" with its metaphorical lyrics, ""Goodnight Goodnight,"" which sounds as if it fell out of Stevie Wonder's amazing songbook and the stunning ""Better that we Break."" Maroon 5's a great band, but here it seems as if they are going after a new audience while trying to sustain their old but without branching out as artists. They can handle more than what they are doing on this disc. Levine at times, treads the same waters as he did in ""Songs about Jane."""
4,Even better then the last one.,I think this Maroon 5 album is the best one so far. I enjoyed the last one but this one is even better. I was very happy with it. It was worth the wait.
5,A stand alone follow up...,"Well it good to know that one of my favortie groups was able to avoid the sophmore slumps. I love this album, as I loved the first. I'm thankful for a little change to the sound, as it shows an artist desire to change, grow, try new things. This is definately something I'm glad they tried."
5,Worth the wait!,"I have been waiting for a new maroon 5 album for awhile, but this was worth the wait! Love it."
1,Poopy,"I really can't stand this band or this CD. My friend Chinderbugs brought a copy of this to our weekly Sound of Music club meeting and we were willing to give it a chance. You know what? Come here, I'm not afraid to tell you, this is just not a good Cd. It's like someone took the music of Juhmeerohkwy and said, it's just not annoying and polished enough. Now you have Maroon 5. I liked ""She will be loved"" because it brings back good memories of me running the show, but I've never liked their other stuff. They just look at you like they are disappointed that you can't make a pot pie like they can. I'm sorry Maroon 5, everytime I try to make a pot pie the crust gets loose on me. Stuff happens. Anyway, if you want a disc that makes your ears bleed and dance like an idiot, get this. If you want to be like me, buy some Johnny Cash underground remix stuff."
4,Can't Maroon 5 Ever Be Happy?,"I was waiting for this a long time. While mostly upbeat in the beginning tracks and somewhat lackadasical towards the end, I really was hoping for something much more WOW.This should have been called ""Songs About {fill in name of female here}"". Maroon 5 never seems to be able to create songs out about good relationships, only breakups. I mean, c'mon ... ""6 ft tall, came without a warning, so I had to shoot him dead""? WHAT?Jeez, guys. Be happy. 5 years is a long time to wait for more ""I realize I really hated you"" stuff you already covered on 'Songs About Jane"".Someone in Maroon 5 needs to quit dating shallow pretty girls and try to enjoy life with a down to earth female. Maybe then we'll hear songs that aren't so depressing.Or maybe not. Rumor has it that Maroon 5 may be breaking up soon ..."
2,Disappointed fan,"After hearing ""Makes Me Wonder"" on the radio I instantly wanted to buy the new album by Maroon 5. I loved ""Songs About Jane"" and I thought if the new track is any indication, they have changed their sound and made something fresh and catchy that I could listen to. I was wrong, maybe it's me, but other than ""Makes Me Wonder,"" all the other tracks on this CD are boring and nothing that I can get hooked on. Some of the tracks reminded me of very ""poppy"" Britney Spears songs and it made me sad to see Maroon 5 conform to pop music and completely abandon their old jazzy sound. I really like the band and I'm hoping they will release a 3rd album with more of the elements that put them where they are today."
3,Okay...,I liked their debut album a lot. This cd was just okay to me. I will continue to support them because they are very talented.
2,"HUGE Maroon 5 Fan, Here","My preorder was downloaded a few minutes ago and almost ALL of the songs on this CD are remade from Songs About Jane. I would not have spent the money to buy remixes. I can do that myself, if I really want to. I am SO disappointed by this CD. I feel like Maroon 5 gave me the shaft and they kept the mine. Wow. This is ultimate buyer game playing. They have had how many years to think of new material and release for all of their anxious fans, such as myself. It's up to you, but I would not waste my money on this remix CD. OH...I love the song Makes Me Wonder...good decision on that song."
2,Picture of the Ford Mondeo in the UK,"Given that the Ford Mondeo is actually a Ford Contour of the UK, there was no information about the pictures that were used. In the section were they talk about changing the radio, the picture shows the climate control dials aren't the same as the Contour's, but of the Mondeo. They should have mentioned that the picture didn't match"
3,"More Coca, please","I bought this to introduce my grandkids (ages 16 and 12) to Your Show of Shows. I'd have liked less talk, more skits ... and more of Caesar and Coca interacting. The sketch with Howard Morris is a winner."
2,Substandard print quality,The problem with this movie is the poor quality print. Yes it's watchable but it's dark and lacking clarity. I bought this DVD-R hoping it would be copied from a better quality source than the other DVD offerings selling at half the price. I gambled and I lost. It's the same poor quality print as the others.
5,Russian,I had not heard any of these pieces before! They are all fantastic and the instrument and recorded sound is excellent. Several of the tracks are very interesting. I had no idea Glazunov wrote so much for the organ!Congratulations to Iain Quinn and Chandos for this great release.
2,Audio Not in Sync!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The player plays video very well and plays all of the formats described but the audio does run in line with the action in the DVD. It only gets worse if you have to pause and restart the movie. Other than this annoying fact, the player works great but I would not recommend anyone to buy this player even at such a low price."
1,Don't Buy This Piece Of Trash,"This DVD player is junk, DON""T BUY IT. At first, it seemed OK, but i hadn't yet noticed the severity of the audio sync problem. My friend pointed it out to me, and then i began seeing it more and more. It's so annoying i power off the DVD player and power it back on to try and get it to work. Also, now it ahs developed a ""Disc Error"" problem. I put in BRAND NEW Dvd's, haven't even been played, and get a ""disc error"" problem. You have to repeat this process about 30 times before it actually loads, and some DVD's don't. I'm going to try and bring it back to where I bought it and complain that it has chronic issues (audio sync), and hopefully get my money back, because this was the biggest waste of money EVER!"
4,I miss JD,"John Denver's life was all to short. He was taken away from us all to soon. I love all his music. This 2 disk set is great, but its missing one very important song. Why wasnt Follow Me included in this compilation? R.I.P John...."
4,JOHN DENVER DVD,"THE ESSENTIAL JOHN DENVER CD IS A WARM RENDITION OF MANY OF JOHN'S PASSIONATE MELODYS. WHATEVER HE RECORDS, WHATEVER THE STAGE IN HIS CAREER, IF YOU'RE A JOHN DENVER FAN, YOU'LL ENJOY LISTENING TO HIS SONGS. THIS DVD IS NO EXCEPTION."
4,Denvers' Best,"IMO, a few of the songs could have been left off and then squeeze the rest onto one CD. A few of the lesser known songs are good, but some aren't for the causal listener, which I am. I like artist compilations of their best stuff, but some songs really are dated and have to be excluded for that reason. In this case, Denver wrote a couple early hits for others, that didn't sound as good when he recorded it, not sure if he recorded and released them earlier or not, but the production quality of those couple of early songs isn't that good compared to when he broke out and made his own hits. It's interesting to hear once, but not repeatedly. This is a problem with most major artists compilations after they die. What to include or not."
5,Useful instruction on finding and playing combinations,"This book talks intelligently about the ways a player can improve combinational ability, in many different types of position.My home library contains 350-400 books, most of which I have read, and yet few of those books have so many original examples as this one. LeMoir has done a great deal of research from sources both old and new.Gambit is a dedicated chess publisher (the owners are all strong chessplayers and they only publish books on chess), and the company has published several books on tactics.However this one contains the best advice on how to swindle an opponent!"
2,Way Too Difficult,"I didn't like this book, but that's because I didn't understand it. This book is written on a VERY high level (1800+ USCF). It's been sitting on my shelf for six months and i still can't understand a word. Don't buy this book unless you're an expert at the game."
1,Neither effective nor interesting,"I find that I learn much better when I'm introduced to new vocabulary in the context of a story or dialog. I was hoping that this CD would have songs or rhymes that would help me remember new words better, but it's just a random list of words read in Spanish and English with music in the background. I was quite disappointed, and would have given it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest. If you learn can subliminally, maybe you can pick up Spanish by listening to this over and over, but I got bored with this very quickly and found it irritating after the first 20 minutes."
5,about time,"there have been a surge of new ""skinhead"" and ""oi"" bands in the last couple of years thanks in part to dropkick...however, these guys have definitely kept it real and stayed true the sound. they are definitely one of the best bands to emerge from a dying scene, so i hope they are willing to carry the torch and bring punk back to life."
5,Kansas City OI!,"This is their first album, so obviosly its their best. They are definately the best oi band from the kansas city scene and one of the best in the world. this album has several great songs from their 7""'s and many great ""new"" songs. but it doesnt come close to representing them live."
3,It Does the Job,"I studied reviews for several different brushes prior to purchasing this one. It works well for the most part. The bristles are very gentle on my car. I like the side brushes a lot. The extendable handle is strong and effective. The only thing I don't like is the hose connector. No matter what I do, I cannot get it to stop leaking. I don't mean it is just dripping a little bit. Water practically pours out of the connection point. I may not be the smartest person, but I've never had a problem connecting sprayers, nozzles, sprinklers, or other attachments to a water hose, until now. It's as though the thread pattern is different or something. Very annoying."
5,Ace Telephone Line Tester.,Item being reviewed is the Ace Telephone Line Tester. It was a excellent choice. The test works as expected and arrived on time.
5,Superbly written,"Edgar Tafel has truly written his Masterpiece! I was rivetted to the story and found it almost impossible to put down. I can only imagine what it was like to be an apprentice to a genius and Edgar has enlightened me. I very highly recommend this book for some enjoyed reading.Also recommended: Many Masks, Drawings and Plans of Frank Lloyd Wright"
2,Adequate but not stellar introduction to hang gliding,"An adequate introduction to the sport, but very thin. Gives only the basics, but lacks detail. The book could also use a good editor."
3,Great new writer,Promising new writer for me to read. I like her style but would like a bit more character development. Well-paced story. Denial love scenes but need a little more development (maybe refer to Brenda Joyce writing?). Will keep watch on her books.
2,Not memorable,"I didn't hate CARNAL GIFT, despite the 2 stars. But it's a very slow-moving story, and it took its time to generate & hold my interest. (I could easily put it down, and wasn't feeling enthused about picking it up again.) The setting is different (Ireland, 1750's), and it started out well, but from that point, it was pretty sterotypical (repressed & resentful Irish and brutal English) and the basic love story and characterizations will remind you of other romances you've read (they certainly reminded me). The author has some talent but I was underwhelmed by the staleness and dragging plot.Nice cover art. That, and the back blurb, persuaded me to buy it, but the old adage ""don't buy a book for its cover"" lived up to its warning in this case."
4,"These worked nicely, gave both of us pleasure ...","These worked nicely, gave both of us pleasure and provided the security we wanted. We'll definitely purchase these again."
5,"I just got this, and I do really like it.","I've been a Mentals fan for many years. I really got hot on Creatures of Leisure when it came out, but gradually thought I'd outgrown them. I recently pulled out Creatures of Leisure and it help up really well...So I pulled out some of their CDs that I'd collected used and cut out over the years. Cats and Dogs was great, as was Cyclone Raymond, and the Greatest Hits collection exposed me to some of their earlier singles, and I was surprised that I liked what I heard, despite the fact that it was much simpler and more basic than Creatures of Leisure. So I finally bought Get Wet, their first album, and I am more than pleasantly surprised. If you got into the Mentals midperiod as I did, don't be afraid to go back to the beginning. They certainly refined their style and their production techniques as time went on, but they were great right out of the gate."
3,Love Julia Duffy,I only bought it to gawk at Julia Duffy. What a beautiful lady. This fulfilled my need for a while. Next will be Brittany Murphy.
3,Excellent Performances - Poor Liner notes,"One would be hard put to find performances of these works elsewhere. There is no background information on the composers or the selctions played. In the Accolay Concerto in a, there is a liner note description that this is part 1 which begs the question: What happened to Part 2 and beyond?"
5,A Feast for the Mind,"An excellent read for anyone who eats food. You will gain a greater understanding of the complex relationship you have with food. The author has a wide background and has done extensive work in many fields. But hey, this is not a dry read. Wise humor peppers the pages making this book deliciously entertaining, insightful and helpful. I devoured it and would recommend it for gift giving, your summer vacation or weekend at the beach.Dr Tim"
3,Pencey Prep,"I have to say, Frank Iero has a damn good voice. Not that it's up to par with most lead singers in the biz today, but it's pretty awesome, I must say. But I love My Chem and I love Pencey Prep. Therefore, I love this cd."
4,Tremendous transition from real soccer,"I myself have played soccer for many, many years. I watch tons of soccer matches, even on the spanish channels. This game really recreates the soccer experience quite well. The AI seems to be top notch and will adjust playing styles, the animations are quite fluid, and the game really requires skill and strategy to play. You do not need to know soccer to play as the game is that simple to pick up. Kick the ball in the net. The real challenge is how the ball has gotten to that point. I personally think this is one of the best soccer games I have ever played and is leaps and bounds over the EA Fifa series. This game may force EA's hand on the soccer market though so keep an eye out for the coming years to see what comes next.I would recommend this game to skill level of player."
2,Not a romance or love sotry!,"I expected a bit better. I guess I am a romantic fool, but this book did not do it for me! It is just too poorly written..."
2,cheated,"Although I very much love Kouyu Shurei, I took a risk (and failed miserably) when I ordered this item. I only saw one blurry picture of the cover and it looked nice enough. But upon getting it today, I find that there a grand total of FIVE and only five prints inside a folder--not a book--and I don't know, I suppose I was expecting a lot more for 50 dollars. I will admit that they are beautiful pictures--very high quality, and beautiful is synonymous with Shurei's art--but I still feel very much cheated.I still gave it two stars because of the quality of the prints. They are on textured paper and on first--or even second or third--glance can be mistaken for an actual, original painting.However, I would not recommend this to buyers. If you are looking for an experience, purchase the Alichino manga (only $10 for so much more content than what I just got) and enjoy the read...and if not the story, you will fall in love with the darkly beautiful art."
5,Haunting!,"Hearing the legendary Bayreuth Bells, subsequently melted down by the Nazi's for cannon fodder, is a truly haunting experience. This is as close as we can get to what Wagner envisioned."
2,A Little Disapointing. Not Up to His Usual Standards,"I love short stories and have been fond of much of what i've read by Harry Turtledove in the past both novels and short fiction. Thus I was disapointed by this book. Virtually none of the stories were of the alternative history variety which is Turtledove's specialty. Moreover, many of the plots were dull and plodding. A few of the stories I had trouble getting through. There were a few good ones in the collection but not enough to make me glad I purchased the volume. This collection is not up to other Turtledove works...."
5,Scariest movie in existence,"Oh my! What a scary movie! This is one of those movies that defy the whole genre-thing. There are no blood-and-guts scenes and the acting is terrific. I love horror movies and have seen a ton, but I actually SCREAMED during this one. Needless to say, I didn't sleep very well that night! See this movie!!"
5,Stellar Horror film,"When I first saw this as a child I was terrified for months. I don't even think i would take baths after that. Yea, it's that good.This is one of the scariest movies ever made, and one of the most underrated. If you thought the evil dead or the shining was terrifying..heh, get this. I've seen them all friends, this is in the top 3.George C. Scott's performance is 100%. One of the true greats of the 20th century and it shows in this Performance. Also check out the VERY underrated Exorcist 3 in which Scott also plays the lead role."
5,"One of the all time BEST ""scary"" movies","I was young when I first saw this movie, but it has always stuck with me as my favorite haunting movie of all. It was the best movie for sleepovers, Halloween, and all-night movie bashes. I still remember being terrified to take a bath because I was certain that somone or something would try and drown me. I believe that growing up a rented this movie at least 20 times, so now I am just going to buy it! I totally urge any horror movie buff to see this movie ASAP."
3,"Not bad, but not all that","I enjoyed this movie, but it's not very scary. It's also a bit slow in spots. What I enjoy about movies from this time is that the actors are more convincing than most of what we see today. But the movies themselves, like this one, are rather tepid, too timid to really get one involved or frightened. I recommend watching this and ""The Hearse"" together to see which you prefer, this one with G. C. Scott, or ""Hearse,"" starring his wife, Trish Van Devere. 'Changeling' is more layered and elegant, while 'Hearse' is simpler, faster-moving and (IMHO) a bit more entertaining."
2,Ruin by atmosphere constantly cut off,"Don't believe the hype:It's more a suspense than a real horror movie!Sure the story is good but I found the overall dull. A cute storie but not to view it twice when you know the end.First, the main character is a tired old man (goerge scott). They should use a 35-40 woman. Where the director miss the point is when a scene become to bring some creepy tension ... it suddenly cut and jump in time to a boring ordinary scene instead of extending it. All these abrupt cuts ruins entirely all the atmosphere and put the movie to the rank of 'only for the story suspense' instead of real horror film.No gore, no blood and unfortunatly not enough atmosphere (because it's constantly cut off)... amityville is much better as atmospheric ghost story than this boring suspense."
4,A chilling little tale of terror!,"When I first saw this chilling treasure of a movie starring the great George C. Scott and Melvyn Douglas, I was hooked. The movie came out around the time of The Omen. This was not as expensive but is very good. Watch it and you will get some chills."
2,Definately not the best haunted house story!,"In a couple of scenes, you can see the camera man's shadow, and even his reflection! This really isn't scary, so skip it. The only good part is the end."
5,Scared the stuffing out of me... & a great mystery to boot,"After George C. Scott loses his wife and daugther in a terrible car accident, he moves into a house he's leasing from a historical society. A sprit, not-at-rest, reaches out to him. The climax of this movie will have you sleeping with a night light again. This goes beyond physical scares (for the most part) and reaches its viewers on a psychological level. A fantastic film and a must see for all horror fans!"
5,Loved it!,"One of the scariest, creepiest movies ever. I bought this movie to show my college son and his friends as an example that scary movies do not require blood and hacked up bodies...they loved the movie and agreed it was one of the scariest they had ever seen."
5,Awesome Infuencial Ghost Story,"If you love Silent Hill games etc, see where much of the imagery and storyline comes from. You can also relate the storyline to modern classics such as The Ring/Ringu and other horror movie standards. This movie is not well known but belongs in every movie lovers library."
3,No North by NW ?,Where the heck is North by Northwest ? One of his best is not on here.Can't be his masterpieces if one of his top 5 is missing.
5,Good Gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my new son-in-law because it was on his Amazon wish list. He was very happy.
3,Missing 36 Page Booklet,"Purchased this item as a birthday gift. 5 weeks later the recipient opened his present, then removed the shrink wrap and opened the box set. The DVDs were there, but there was no 36 page booklet inside as promised. We looked everywhere. Nope - not included. According to Amazon's site, I can't return or exchange this item as I am 1 week past the 30 day return date. Thus, I am only giving this 3 stars as a package deal. The set looks great, the DVD quality was quite good - but the gift was a disappointment without the booklet; especially as it was purchased for a collector/fan. If the booklet had been included, I would have given it 5 stars. Obviously this was a manufacturing issue, and not Amazon's fault per se, but gift items really should have a longer return/exchange window."
5,Excellent,"I recently purchased this box set and i have to say I am very pleased with it. There have been a lot of complaints about this, although many of them are ridiculous, the most ridiculous of which is the complaints about the cover art and the music on each DVD. Regardless of whether picture was drawn up for the show (same goes for the music), to many, this is what is associated with Mr. Hitchcock. Everyone knows him by the song and the sketch, stop being so nit-picky. The box looks great. Also, for 14 movies (yes, FOURTEEN), the price of a little less than $100 is certainly reasonable. In fact, it could be sold for much more. As for the selection, if you don't like it, don't buy the set. And if you bought it anyway, then don't complain.Again, an excellent box set that I would certainly recommend to any Hitchcock fan or any fan of film in general."
1,Packaging Incomplete - NO BOOKLET,I bought two of these box sets in October when they went on sale saving them for Christmas gifts. Christmas day comes and the recipients both open their gifts and NEITHER has the advertised 36-page booklet. Makes me wonder how many of these sets were sent out without booklets that both sets I received were missing them. It's too late to return to Amazon and there doesn't appear to be any way to obtain the missing booklet from them. I'm really disappointed in this box set that it was NOT what was advertised.
4,WHAT HAPPENED TO PRODUCTION,"THIS CD WAS AWESOME....GREAT BEATS, GREAT COLLABOS, GREAT LYRICISTS, BUT THE PRODUCTIO WAS OFF. NONE OF THESE SONGS BANGED HARD BASS. THE SECOND SNOWGOONS(BLACK SNOW) WAS PRODUCED MUCH BETTER. EVERY TRACK WAS THUMPING. ITS TOO BAD THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY LACKING ELEMENT, OTHERWISE I WOULD STILL HAVE THIS IN MY PLAYER NOW."
2,Another wordy book that should only be 50 pages,"The book is very wordy and goes into the history of the web to start. It is definitely not a manager's guide but a mismash of different subjects that drags on for over 400 pages. If you are slightly technical this is not the book. If you want the basics, I'm sure Motorolla Press has something less cumbersome and provides more value."
3,Response to Jay Jones.,You can be critial about the author or the book but your negative comment on India shows your prejudice.
2,The lack of licensing ruins it as always.,"Like any other game in the sries winning eleven eight puts a strong emphasis on gameplay, and being a big fan of the sport i appreaciate that fact. But once again the lack of licensing brings the games presentation down along with visuals that cant compare to the fifa series. I have been buying both fifa and winning eleven 8 games side by side for a long time, and every year i enjoy fifa more. While i can understand why this game is said to be better then fifa and is pereffered by gamers it still doesnt work for a statistical buff like me who finds licensing to be an important part of ne soccer game."
1,A Worthless Book,"After reading through this book, I have decided to destroy it rather than donate it to the local library.The amount of misinformation included here is almost dangerous in its scope. About half way through the book I realized that the inconsistencies would be obvious even to someone not experienced with computer technology.The preface is dedicated to MCSE instead of A+ exams.On page 194 he claims that the original Pentiums include 16KB L1 Cache. On page 195, he claims they support up to 512KB L1 Cache.The book is riddled with this kind technical inaccuracy, making it unusable.Sure, some of the information is useful - but what is the point of even trying to use it, if you have to double-check everything with another source because you can't trust the author?The next A+ book I read, I hope the author gets the FACTS right."
2,definitely not one-size fits,"The overall design isn't bad (hence 2 stars). But I don't get why they made something one size that isn't adjustable. I'm 5'4"", 140lbs -- I'd hardly say my legs are ""small"". This thing is just huge. I returned it."
3,"Comfy, but not great fit for my skinny legs!","This product says it fits my height and weight, but the fit's still not perfect. It is pretty comfortable, but gets loose after walking 20 minutes straight."
3,"Seems well made, but definitely not one size","I'm a size 12P/14P and this product didn't come close to fitting properly. It seems very well made, so I don't think it deserves a 1 star rating. I think it would be a perfect fit for those size 10 and below. I would purchase again if they had my size."
2,Disappointed,Unfortunately 1 size often means 1 size fits most. The support was too tight when stretched enough for the velcro to clasp.
2,Not one size fits all,"The Wellgate For Women Gel Comfort Knee Support, 1 size is not for all. I read reviews before ordering but after receiving this item, if you are a larger woman don't depend on this to fit. I read where smaller women were having problems because it was to large for them. I'm sure it works for some women that are in the middle of small and large it fits perfectly. Not happy with it."
5,Wellgate for women,I bought this for my Mother-In-Law and my tired it. very happy with this product very comfy tooMother in law didn't use it yet but I know she will love this product
5,Wellgate for women Gel-Cofort Knee support,"This product is everything that was told about it, & fits great I don't believe it would fit anyone with to large of leg I am 155 lbs & fits real well."
4,For my son,"My son requested a leather-bound journal for Christmas to chronicle his first year away at college. It looked nicer than many of the journals I'd seen in my price range. Cover feels a little ""plastic-y"" but that may help with durability. I will see how he keeps up with journaling before investing in a true leather bound journal."
4,Doesn't work with my LG Chocolate,"I was able to pair the S2 with my Verizon LG Chocolate just fine, but I could not use it. When pushing the ""finger"" to make a call, it would immediately disconnect. I tried lots of combinations of button-pressing both on the S2 and cell, without success. Before giving up, I contacted BlueAnt and they agreed that the LG Chocolate (and certain other phones) possibly wouldn't work with the S2 because of something in the cell circuitry. I returned it. In its place, I purchased a Motorola T305, which works fine with my Chocolate but has personality problems (see T305 reviews). I don't think it is in the same league as the S2, but it does offer hands-free safety. Which is what I was looking for."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"I PAIRED THIS HIGH QUALITY ITEM WITH MY VERIZON RAZRMAX VE......AND ITS BEEN FLAWLESS......I DO ALOT OF DRIVING FOR MY PROFESSION, AND I GOT TIRED OF LOOKING LIKE MR SPOCK WITH A BLUETOOTH DEVICE HANGING OUT OF MY EAR , THIS IS A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO NOT HAVING TO DRIVE AROUND WITH MY CELL PHONE TO MY EAR AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD AND RISKING A TICKET. THIS IS A VERY WELL BUILT ITEM WITH A VERY EASY TO USE VOLUME CONTROL AND PAIRS VERY EASILY TO BLUETOOTH ENABLED PHONE....THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY EASYAND THE SUPPORT IF YOU NEED IT FROM BLUEANT IS EXCELLENT.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS ITEM IF YOU NEED A BLUETOOTH DEVICE IN YOUR CAR OR HOME THAT WILL GIVE YOU A SPEAKERPHONE WITH EXTREME CLARITY AND QUALITY"
5,Great Way To Be Handsfree,"The Blue Ant has become a major part of my driving enjoyment! Now I can make and recieve calls easily and safely! I like it so much that I have purchased one for a friend and when I showed it to my brother, he immediately went on line and destroyed my birthday gift plans for him!Truly Great Product!"
4,It actually works,The BlueAnt Bluetooth Portable Handsfree Supertooth II Handsfree speakerphone is just like its title and its easy to use and it works even for those that aren't gadget knowledgable. If my husband can use it anyone can.
2,not reliable with centro or treo,"The sound quality in the car is great. The callers often complain that they can't understand me despite talking directly into the mic.The thing that makes this unuseable is that it often links to my phone but doesn't actually connect. I may or may not hear it ringing when I make a call... and, even though I am connected to the device, when the caller answers, we can't hear each other....it isn't really connected.so, this is useless"
4,Not bad.,"It is a good product. It is very easy to synch up to a phone. The draw back is that there is a list of compatible phones that it will work well with it. While it will work with any Bluetooth phone, you may have problems if you're not on the list. My phone was not on the list and it works and I have not had a complaint from any one except my buddy who was on a Bluetooth headset. He got major feedback and missing words when he talked to me but everyone else can hear me fine. The speaker is plenty loud enough. All in all I'm happy with it. Very easy to use."
1,Horrible Product,"Bought this product about 2 months ago. I really had high hopes for it. It has only worked a couple of times when I first got it - where I could actually hear the other person through the speaker. So, I was dumb enough to throw the box away at that point. Since then, it has never worked. I can barely hear through the speaker. People on the other end can't hear me at all. I have tried uninstalling the device and reinstalling...nothing works. I don't drive a noisy car either. I have a 2004 Explorer that is pretty quite on the road. I also use a Motorola Q. It is supposed to work fine with that phone. I also tried to pair the device with my wife's phone, a Motorola V710. Same thing, it pairs up, but I can't hear anything through the speaker. I guess I will go back to using a bluetooth headset. Please don't waste your money on this garbage."
4,BlueAnt Supertooth II is great,Pros: Clever powerful magnets on the device coupled with a steel visor clip makes it simple and convenient remove and install and this unit also makes a first rate speaker phone outside the vehicle as well.Sync up with my Blackberry was quick and painless; speaker clarity inside the cabin of my econo-box is crystal clear and robust.Persons on the other end of my hands free conversations say they didn't believe I was using a hands free device because there was no distortion or echo.Cons: Does not automatically find my phone and initiate the linkup. I must manually establish contact every time I enter the car.This is the best piece of electronics I have purchased in a long time. I highly recommend it.
3,No quite good enough.,"The voice quality is good for those you call, but at highway speeds the volume in the car is not quite loud enough. I have a quiet Mercedes and I still can't use in on the freeway. It works fine arounds town. I use it with a Treo 680 and it creates a quirk with the phone. After I use the Blue Ant, I need to power off the phone and power it back on or I can't hear those I call with regular phone (no Bluetooth)."
5,surprised,My nephew had suggested I watch this movie. I loved the movie and the music. It's on my ipod and I enjoy it each time one of the songs come up.
3,A Good Guide But Not the Best,"I have read all of the guidebooks about Costa Rica while living in the country. Frommer's is well written and is filled with useful tips for the first-time traveller. However, Moon's Costa Rica Handbook contains at least twice the information."
4,Frommer's is better than Adventure Guide to Costa Rica(4th),"This book is much better than the Adventure Guide to Costa Rica (4th Edition). I ordered them both and Frommer's contains much more detail, is in a friendlier format, and is just more professionally done. You certainly don't need both and Frommer's is the way to go. The one frustrating thing about both these books is that they always assume your (sub)trips start in San Jose! Since most tourists travel around CR, it would be nice to take the vantage point of different locales to better understand transportation options, travel times, and tours. But this holds true for websites I've found on CR as well, so I can't fault the authors."
4,Easy to Use,"I've used this product several times since I received it and found it very easy to operate. The instructions were clear and understandable. The one criticism I have is that the little mirror is virtually worthless. Although it is a great idea, it is too small for me to be able to see with any clarity."
3,Not bad for the price...,"Just received this product. The video clips are all MOV files, and are nicely organized. The resolution isn't as high as I'd hoped, but for the price it's okay. If you don't mind either a smaller screen size or slightly blurry video at larger sizes, then you'll like this video. I would only recommend these stock clips for the amateur video producer, though."
3,was it a mistake???,"o.k. i'm not exactly that one who should review because of his skills in the music-area, i have to admit that this was the first time i heard something from hooverphonic...i've got this cd from my friend and i DONT THINK THAT THE CUSTOMERS WHO LISTENED TO HOOVERPHONIC (AT LEAST TO ""SIT AND LISTEN"") WOULD ALSO BE FANS OF LAMB OR MASSIVE ATTACK and other way round(see recomendation from Amazon), I THINK IT ISNT APPROPRIATE TO RECOMMEND THIS MUSIC GROUP TOGETHER WITH THOSE MENTIONED.maybe for those who like groups like Gathering...would be this cd an exquisite pleasure to hear, but as i like rather Lamb, Air, Massive Attack or Underworld, for me these tracks were DISSAPOINTMENT."
4,"These were very easy to apply, and comfortable ...","These were very easy to apply, and comfortable for both my wife and me. I'd definitely recommend these to my sons -- I've put some in the spare bedroom for when they visit!!!"
3,"If You Are A Reggaeton Collector, Than Get This Cd",This is not the best Master Joe and O.G. Black but it is still one to get. There is some cool songs in this cd but as well is the boring ones. This is not the best but if you are a collector than get this anyway.
3,not as advertised,"this product was supposed to be packaged in a plastic case to be carried as a keychain, however it came in a cardboard box. the describtion should match the produt as advertised"
4,History Made Easy,"Great way to learn about Middle Eastern culture, mores and cuisine. The story threads through Moroccan society from 1882 to 1907, with a light romance that captivates. Readers will take to the quick paced account of Lili, a Moroccan girl adopted by the American Ambassador. Lili, along with her British and aristocratic Arab cohorts, lives through civil war as the French strive to dominate the region.A must read for anyone unfortunate enough not to have lived in Tangier."
5,A Rich and Vibrant Tapestry,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which kept me coming back for more as often as I could. Wonderfully rich in detail, with endearing characters and a perfect pace.Knowing nothing about Morocco prior to reading this novel - I now feel like I have lived and breathed its essence and culture, thanks to the Author's wonderfully descriptive account of a special period in time.Thank you for an enjoyable reading experience."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book due to the glowing reviews of the other reviewers, and was very disappointed. The book was sloppily edited. I wasn't looking for errors, but kept finding them - picky stuff like typos, contradictions, and word for word repetition. A writing book shouldn't contain these types of errors.Nearly half of the book was long-winded bios of SF authors which were sometimes interesting, but mostly not - and suggested nothing to improve writing. There were a few good tidbits, but they were few and far between.Do not buy. Get Damon Kight's book instead - Creating Short Fiction. Much more practical and interesting."
5,SOX,"Excellent product, arrived early - will buy from this seller many times I hope! Too bad I used another - it won't happen again!"
4,gradson,This is the 2nd purchase as he lost the first gun. He has enjoyed it and it has held up to his playing
2,marginal electronica,"I was really let down by this disk and sold it immediately. They should hardly call it electro-jazz. It's just marginal electronica. Hardly jazzy, very repetitive, like it should be the background music while you're shopping at Express.If you really want some real electro-jazz check out Amon Tobin or Nicola Conte."
4,Decent,"I think this book has great intentions.Its not the kind thats bores you, its a quick and easy read.Especially, good when you want to reference back.I am not saying it covers everything, but finding a book that covers everything would be overwhelming, and I'd prob. not pick it up unless its organized exceptionally well.Anyway, this book is a 4/5 for me because I think it could have covered a little bit more.It is a book that I would recommend to a vegetarian, because I have not found a good book on vegetarian nutrition.Plus what I like is that it does not OVER EMPHASIZE SOY, which I can't stand eating. Most vegetarian books tend to do that, and its very frustrating.I also like parts where it compares apgar scores, nutrition profiles etc of meat eating vs. vegetarian etc..Its reassuring for some people I bet."
2,Not a good choice...,"I bought this book hoping that it would tell me some things I didn't know about eating healthy as a vegetarian while pregnant. When I got it, I found that it wasn't helpful at all. It spends a great deal of time talking about other pregnancy issues that have nothing to do with nutrition or being vegetarian. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Great Reference!,"As a vegetarian, I have many questions about what to eat while pregnant or trying to conceive. I feel that this book does an excellent job outlinging the main points of a vegetarian diet and pregnancy. In a simple question and answer format, the author clearly provided information for all my questions. I liked that it was straightforward and simply put without overdoing it on the herbal remedies like other books I have read. It is a good reference!"
3,Ok for an oolong,This tea tasted okay for an oolong. I was looking for something a little fresher tasting. It helps to steep the tea for less than 2 minutes. The packaging is sturdy and pretty. This will probably make about 60 cups of tea since the leaves can be reused up to 3 times. (It actually tastes better the second and third brewing.)
5,Wonderful,I look forward to doing this exercise series every morning. Scott provides gentle instructions to the gentle exercises. Clare is inspiring. Great!
1,No notification of cancellation,"I pre-ordered this item, but now when i look at ""My Account"" the order is not listed. Apparently, Amazon has cancelled my order without even notifying me. I didn't even receive an e-mail."
1,C13:01 ERROR . Not compatible with sony products,This product is not compatible with Sony DSC F707. The memory stick adaptor doesn't do anything other than throwing error.Sandisk claims that it works with all memeory stick products with the given adapter is false and don't believe that. I searched the internet after buying and found this non-compatibility issue with C13:01 ERROR is universal.Beware before buying.
2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe I was using the product wrong, but it didn't seem to do much good for my shoes. Granted, I had done quite a number on them wearing them out on New Year's Eve, but it seemed that other people had much more success. I followed the directions, but it really just seemed like I was rubbing an old-school eraser on the shoe and then scratching them up with the brush. I guess the shoes are ruined?"
1,too too smal,"I thought it would be big enough for my weekend tripswell, its not. its just setting there i cant use it for anything.its just a waste of money thats what it is."
1,WARNING! Dr Browns Bottles Are Made Using BPA Bisphenol-A.,"I liked Dr Browns Bottles, my daughter Liked them too! Then I found out about Bisphenol -A being used to make the Bottles. After re-searching Bisphenol -A, I discovered that exposing my baby to harmful chemicals with the potential for long term affects later in life, was definitely not for me!! There are other options out there, all glass bottles are safe, as well as Born Free, Mam by Sassy, Green to Grow and Adrini. Do your own research. I'm really surprised the non Bisphenol -A Free bottles haven't been recalled yet! I'm sure it's just a matter of time, before enough people are educated. Note! The Glass Bottles By Dr Browns Are Safe!"
3,Too much talk before the talk.,"This is a useful introduction to the value of self-talk as a means of guiding one's self-change efforts. The introductory story likening a child's search for buried treasure to the difficulties adults have in discovering inner worth is cute, but rather tedious, as is the repetitious discussion of various other details. I have no quarrel with the author's argument favoring intelligent plan and implementation of self-talk, but it does seem to me that the contents of this particular set could be reduced to only one cassette with no loss in meaning. Still, I do recommend the set. I only wish the presentation had been more efficiently edited."
2,Just be sure you know what you are buying,"The price was great and they are well made. These are not mittens though as the photo may suggest. They are covered, insulated gloves. They appear much more difficult and time consuming to build than mittens; probably thought we would get the best of both worlds. The problem for me is I have both permanently frosbite damaged index fingers and needed the warmth of a mitten that gloves can not give. Mittens allow all the fingers to remain together to warm each other. These ""hybrids"" take away that benefit by insulating the fingers from each other so were of no use to me. Maybe the designer lives in the sunbelt, who knows, but I'm certain they were well intentioned, but...I can't return them because of a 25% [minimum] restocking fee plus postage will likely exceed the cost of the gloves. They might be fine for someone who knows they are gloves and wants gloves. These will now be gifts for my kids who don't have my finger/warmth problems yet.Thank you,MR"
4,Toby rules,"Great DVD set for Toby Radloff fans. The original Killer Nerd is a classic cheesy ""horror"" flick. The bonus of the second movie is alright, but not great. The 'Bride' is only 55 minutes long!"
5,Kratt's Creatures,"Again this type of dvd/cd was both entertaining and educational to my grandchildren and I like watching it myself. You are never too old to learn new facts about the ""creatures"" in the Kratt's world."
5,OH YEAH,The kids looooooove this movie! It is a great addition to their classic movies. I do recommend this movie if it is still available.
3,Biltmore Estate,"While excellent new quality at reasonable discount from new at Biltmore gift shop, this book had a little too much construction detail which somewhat redundant of what covered during Biltmore tour and less general information on the Biltmore Estate which would have been more appealing."
5,great toy,This is a great toy. I'm a star wars fan and a fire fighter so this was a must have for me and the price was also good.
3,Not good... Frustrating!,"The game is frustrating. That's simply it. There are only eight stages, and all the people I know that play this game say it's frustrating.The controls hurt. The graphics aren't moving at 60 FPS, so the controls are clumsy. Left analog to move, right analog to turn. Easy? Not easy when you have a choppy frame rate.The game has some very strange mechanics. The strangest is the security cameras. One time, I went right across the camera. The alarm didn't sound. Weird. Later I tried it again. Now it sounded. Wacky!There is also a ton of tricky spots in the game. Tons of laser securities and cameras. Tons. On the first level, half of it is laser security. It's frustrating to manage. You have to wander around quite a bit just to figure out what to do.That being said, the game is a bit fun. Sneaking and killing is fun. That's it. Other portions of the game failed.This game dropped from 50 to 20 bucks (new) in 2 months. Does that tell you something?"
1,GIVE US SOME NEW IDEAS!!,Back to the basics! This book would have broader appeal if it had more than just the basic ideas that everyone in the business is already pursuing.
3,Surprise!,"I was shopping for short stories on cassette tape to read while I was working in the kitchen. I did not notice that this was a tape by Kenny Rogers, which probably has a song called Short Stories. One of these days I'll listen to it. Caveat Emptor."
1,This is Garbage!,I consider myself a Gentle Giant fanatic. This poor excuse for an attempt at commercialism. This record never should have been released. It's... You can finish the sentence. That's all there is to it!
4,Good intro,"I'm a big fan of the show and most people that read this book probably are as well. It's not a series like Lord of the Rings but it's not a bad book either. It's not real long, you can read it over a weekend and get a little bit of an Alias fix quickly. It's geared toward young adults so if that's not you don't expect something else. It's a good book if you want a good story, geared toward young adults, that's all about Alias and discovering life before the tv series.I love it and have read others as well. I'm planning on reading most, if not all of them. I like to know what others think life for Syd was like before we all starting watching her on tv!"
2,"Great track, mediocre b-side","Great track, mediocre b-side, a worthy buy for the collector or fanatic of garbage, but for the light-fan, do pass.werp"
3,SLOW and MELLOW!!!,"If you want a good mix of slow and fast music, this is NOT the album for you!!! The Kings Singers ""A Little Christmas Music"" is better for that purpose.In this album, although every songs is as beautiful and flawless as you would expect from the Kings Singers, it is so mellow you will have to fix an expresso just to stay awake!I guess if you are the ultra-hyper kind that needs something to mellow you out during the holidays, this would be just right for you. But I need energetic songs once in a while to keep me moving."
1,It's OK,"This book is ok, but it really seems to be more of the same old-same old. Most of the information has been said in many past travel books and newspaper articles. I think this is basically old information packaged to take advantage of the events of 9-11."
2,High level introductory text,"This book is targeted to large traditional corporations - not the ""new economy"" companies that are doing a lot of the alliances these days.It also lacks depth, providing only an outline of the Booze Hamilton approach to alliances. The book is a sales tool in that if you want to learn all the details of their process, you must buy an engagement in addition to the book.So, if you are with a large corporation, skip the book and call a consultant. If you are in the new economy skip the book."
2,Intro Text,"I gave this book 2 stars rather than 1, as it is a decent introductory text (with its share of fluff) with a couple of good charts (though a preponderance of ""filler"" charts). However, the book is a thinly disguised publicity push of Booz Allen (and a few others). And the book is impractical since it is virtually devoid of tools--rather useless for the professional. Caveat emptor."
2,"Watch it if you like sit coms, otherwise, don't bother.",This appears to be a broadly acted play filmed in front of a live audience who are familiar with the cast. I turned it off after a few minutes.
3,what my husband doesnt know,this was ok but thought it would be better. its ok its ok its ok its ok thats all i have to say
4,The Sea Wife,"The Sea Wife is a book that reminds me of all the reasons why I stopped reading many historical romances. There aren't enough like this one! The Sea Wife entertains the reader while not annoying the reader by being historically inaccurate. Holly Cook manages to weave a wonderfully entertaining Gothic tale while not straying from historical accuracy - which makes it a rollicking good tale in the vein of Laura Kinsale. Any reader who likes a really vivid story with true-to-life characters, a good Alpha hero and a heroine with guts and fire, and secondary characters that are simply adorable, I recommend The Sea Wife thoroughly!"
2,loose exercise gloves,"I purchased the size Small, and they sent me X-Small, which actually worked out as they seem to run large. The issue was the back of the hand side where the mesh material is tend to stretch quite a bit. After a couple of uses, the gloves seems very loose on you pre-strapping with the Velcro.Seems like good quality with the palm side, good leather, good grip, but comfort on the wear itself is a bit doubtful, unfortunately."
4,Great basic phone,"I've had this phone for about 4 months and it's a great basic phone. It does the basics very well but it does have some things a don't like.Pro'sGreat sound and reception. I get full reception on the lower level of Grand Central Station as well as Metronorth. Someone was complaining about the sound being to low. Turn up the sound and the side of the phone.Very nice screen and easy to use menu system.You can quickly put the phone in vibrate mode by pressing and holding the * key.Con'sYou can't get rid of the word ""cingular"" scrolling on the outside display.When you save contacts to your SIM card and then have double entries.No flash on camera, no big deal for me as I have a digital camera.Ringtones suck and 1 crappy game but no big deal for me, I have an ipod and an xbox :).Overall, if you are looking for a ""phone"" you can't go wrong with the this LG>"
2,"Pretty meh, all around","I have had this phone for about a month and a half, and I'm getting rid of it. The ringer is not loud enough, photo called ID is overrated, it lacks bluetooth, and is big and bulky.I don't like having to use vibrate just to know if someone is calling me, but I am stuck doing so just to know when I'm getting a call. Having the thing clipped to you while you're watching TV is a little ridiculous. Alas, if you want to know if someone is calling, you need to have it on vibrate, touching you. Forget it.I'm going to sell this one, and buy a V551 instead. It's what I should have done from the beginning, but I wanted photo caller ID instead. If the photo caller ID is the only reason you're buying this one instead of something like the V551, don't bother: it's not that cool anyway."
4,This is a good Phone,"This phone is good, comparing to Motorola V180 that Cingular is giving for free. Motorola V180 sucks!!!!. This phone has a easy access menu and very easy to Program.Sound is very clear, It's not very fancy, but it does what it suppose to do."
4,Cool Phone,"If you are looking to buy a new phone this should be the one you consider. The LG L1400 comes with alot of extra for its cheap price($115) but as with everything theres room for improvement: Louder Ringtones, allow you set thngs recorded from the voice recorder as the ringtones, more games, speakerphone...Other Than that The Phone is GREAT!!"
4,One of the best phones I have had!,I found this phone to have one of the coolest camera features ever the outside large screen to let u see yourself when taking your own picture unlike the tiny mirror on most phones! It takes good quality pictures and has outstanding sound quality. I also found it easyest to navagate. The only bad side i found is its bulky and has no zoom on camera!
2,Philips - LISTEN UP,"You have a _great_ product here. I loved having it. The sound is good, and rechargeable batteries make it so convenient.You need to do two things with this product:1) Allow music to come from a SD card2) Use USB 2.0Then you will have a winner and I'd definitely get one.I returned mine."
1,"Terrible, just terrible","Unfortunately, the music of this band is identical to the sad and pathetic nature of its publicity attempts. Like another reviewer mentioned, it sounds as though this album is a blatant, uninspired ripoff of NIN. Were it not for the disgusting, morally repulsive nature of their ""stunts,"" this band would garner no attention whatsoever. This band is more like a freak show than a musical ensemble."
1,Load of Trash,"This is the Marilyn Manson sound-alike, But they did it like a load of trash. They didn't make music at all. That's why their show will include live suicide. So Poor"
2,A dissapointment,"Despite the cheesy title, i bought this book on the strength of MW & TH's previous books, which are excellent. I read this, however, and wondered if their hearts were really in it. The plot was a predictable, off-the-shelf, race to the ancient artifact. The characters were weak, they had odd and changing motivations, and trite dialogue. Parts of the book make no logical sense. Most dissapointing was the setting. The starshield universe held a bright promise for mixing scifi and fantasy, but there is little to no science here. The authors seem to have fallen back to their old material and use only d&d creatures. The setting might just as well have been the forgotten realms. And obviously someone is hung up on sailing and sailing terms. Do your self a favor, skip this book, and hope for better in the future."
5,A perfect continuance to a wonderful serries!!!,"A MUST READ! WIES AND HICKMAN HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!!! This is a wonderful book. It is a bit different from there norm (or from any other standard of normality for that matter) but it is still them. This book elaborates greatly on the STARSHIELD universe which has been a great success. The Nightsword gives a wonder feel for what the STARSHIELD universe is, and introduces a lot more races and cultures than the last book.It puts a compleatly new spinn on what a typical fantasy novel would have."
5,Nightsword is a success!,"_Nightsword_ does, infact, deliver more on the Story of the Starshield Universe. _Nightsword_ is a powerful novel whose universe is based on Quantum Physics, making a dynamic medium with which to work in._Nightsword_ follows _The Mantle of Kendis-Dai_ beautifully, adding the ideas of others into the plot, making it a living work. The Mythology behind the Starshield Universe is also expertly revealed: from hints at Earth's involvement in the Galaxy's distant past to Lokan's Crusade to stamp out racial diversity, literally.I say that anyone interested in reading this book should do so, but only after you've read the first one first. Or you would be lost."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I ordered a brand new book in early September. It took ten days to arrive (not typical for Amazon). I thought I was dealing direct with Amazon which I have only had wonderful customer service. The supposed new book arrived in a crumpled horrible looking package. I opened the book and it was obviously used. Cover was worn and had a tear in it. I was very disappointed as it was to be a gift. I returned the book and was told on October 18 via email that I would be refunded. The refund could take up to ten days. They asked me to take off unfavorable information. I did that in good faith. As of this writing, Oct. 28th, I still have not received my refund. This is totally unacceptable that the refund has taken this long. I will be very careful in the future to make sure I am only working directly with Amazon. I am reposting my unfavorable review. Be careful of this company!!!"
3,Emily of New Moon,"The first season of Emily of New Moon was quite good, including these two episodes. Later seasons strayed far from the books and became almost ridiculous, but the style of acting and directing definitely have the feel of the books."
4,Easy to follow,"This text book along with the CD's was very easy to follow and understand. The only reason why this did not get 5 stars from me is due to the fact that it is marketed as a beginners Spanish book, which it is, but it is geared toward someone who would be traveling to a Spanish speaking country in Europe. I would like to learn more Spanish that I could use in America comfortably. I did not need to know all the ""tourist"" expressions that this book was teaching me. If you are going to a European country where Spanish is the native language, then you are in luck and this is a great book. Not so good for the American trying to learn a second language for everyday use."
3,"Where is ""vosotros?""","Why is the 2nd person plural informal form ""vosotros"" omitted entirely from this book? One cannot simply use ""ustedes"" (2nd person plural formal) when speaking to friends or children, for example."
5,Great deal!,Bought it w/other books for when I had my 1st child and it's very informative. Written by the experts themselves.
3,Pretty Good Resource,"This book is not as great as I had hoped. I am a first time mom and wanted a book that would help when I have questions, like how to help baby feel better when he has a cold, when to take him to the doctor, and how to get through teething. This book did not really offer much on what I've had questions about so far. I would choose something else next time."
1,Extremely Outdated,"We were given this by our pediatrician's office, and even our MD admitted it wasn't the most up-to-date publication. There is a lot of outdated information and unsubstantiated ""facts,"" and it is not well organized. There are much better options out there. The AAP should be ashamed - or at least embarrassed enough to do an update."
4,Great information,"I'm still working my way through it. There's a ton of information, and I find myself re-reading sections. Well-organized with easy to find headings under each section for eating, health and developmental expectations."
5,everything is as advertised!,"great great audio book ""good to great and the social sectors"" good product lightening fast shipping ordered on a sat. received on a mon. this is gonna end being a lot of repeat business i am impressed to say the least!"
2,Not happy,"I did not realize this was only the accompany to Good to Great. I was looking for the actual book which meant I had to make another purchase, I wasn't happy."
2,Good to Great and the Social Sectors,"The item was received in excellent condition. The contents are certainly not Great, and rating it Good is generous. If it isn't mandatory reading, don't buy it."
1,not very specific or missing details: do not buy this book,"I has been working for the public sector for over 15 years. Those times were a part of my long journey to search for the right realistic answers to fill the gaps between increasing demands from people and the services delivered. I has been very tired of bureacracy inside, lack of passion for those so-called experienced, and strong private interests, let alone the unpredictable political influences. This book does not help much for my long quests."
2,So much promise . . . . falls short in the execution!,"This book (actually I listened to the CD version) would have been a useful chapter or two published as part of the original ""Good To Great"" book. Unfortunately, I didn't think that it stood up well on its own. I was hoping for some sort of ""aha"" moment, but this 'monograph' failed to deliver. Maybe Jim Collins and his team were not able to do the same in-depth research on non-profits as was done on the Corporations for ""Good To Great"".Hmmm . . . I was disappointed and thought I overpaid for the relative value I got out of 'Social Sectors'."
4,A good backstop to any trip to Boston's sites,"We purchased this book in Boston and found almost all of the sites we saw in town in this book. In this book, the older, up to 150-year old photo of the original structures on the current site, or older pictures than offered a juxtaposition of the surrounding landscape of buildings present in the past and now around selected sites.While I was a little disappointed in no picture of Fenway Park, or in a map to help locate where some of these pictures were taken in the city (after all, I'm not a native of Boston), I found the book to very ably support the exhibits we saw on Boston's history, and add greatly to my understanding of the city and the growth of urbanism in general. The architecture depicted is often unique, and the descriptions offer a bit of information on who the architects were, how the areas shown were constructed, and more.Overall, I came out pretty pleased by what is found in this book."
5,An indispensable guide to women who write mystery series.,"I loved the first Silk Stalkings, and am thrilled with the new edition, which contains well-researched, cross-indexed information about my favorite kind of author--women who write series mysteries. The book is cross-referenced and chock full of information, not the least of which are lists of authors with all their psuedonyms for those who write under more than one name. I couldn't do without this book."
1,This book TERRIFIED ME!,"I am 12 weeks pregnant with twins, and this book has scared the bejesus out of me. These women had nothing but horror stories to tell - from being unable to exercise, walk, have sex, to bedrest and then sleepless nights for 9 months! even to having the whole family fall apart and the twins almost resulting in a divorce! While I realize this will be harder than my singleton pregnancies and births (which were incredibly easy), I don't appreciate being scared out of my wits."
5,The best introduction to early US migrations,"They went where?!One of the most difficult things for the beginning genealogist or historian to understand is how, and why, various populations moved across the early American landscape. This book packs easily understood information on the ways that early America was settled into a format that you can carry to the library without breaking your back. There's an amazing amount of information here: trails, roads, turnpikes, canals, rivers, flatboats, land availability, group migrations, etc. The book includes many helpful maps, plus notes and suggestions for further reading. Dollarhide writes very clearly, making what could be dry material in other hands blessedly understandable and intriguing.This book is a great value for its reasonable cost."
4,Olsens Rule,This cd is great and i always listen to it if im down in the dumps. my favourite song has to be dancing your dreams. i think they r really great songs nad definatly worth buying. I also brought i am the cute one (blisterpack) and loved that to. i think the olsens r really great and very talented
2,the most self-defeating book of its time,"Nancy Reagan does all she can to defuse the negative images of herself by telling her real story in the white house, but for most readers she ends up only reinforcing their negative impressions. She has a huge list of grudges to work through, and strikes back at endless people who she had conflicts with, including her own children. Kitty Kelley, who did her best to paint Nancy in the worst light in her bio, concluded in the end that of all the kiss-and-tell books that embarrassed the Reagan administration, this one was the most damaging... and she may be right."
3,alternate universe,"Review by Isis Beckhardt: Did the other reviewers read a memoir porrtraying an entirely different woman than I did? Nancy Reagan reveals herself to be exactly as numerous others described her: entitled, shallow, manipulative, and self-centered. For eight years, she was in a unique position to contribute to the greater good and to dedicate herself to a causes larger than herself. Instead, lacking a moral compass, her concerns were designer clothes and jewelry (without paying for them), socializing with the elite, berating those she considered beneath her, and turning a cold shoulder to the disenfranchised she could have greatly assisted had she not refused to be ""inconvenienced.""I am sincerely glad for her happy and loving marriage; I just wish that, counting her blessings, she would have been willing to translate her joys to helping others find their own."
4,"OK, but dry","This is a follow-on to Professor Lloyd's book ""Early Greek Science from Thales to Aristotle"". It contains chapters of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers, Hellenic Mathematics, Hellenic Astronomy, Hellenic Biology and Medicine, Applied Mechanics and Technology, Ptolemy, Galen and The Decline of Ancient Science. I found this book much more focused than his previous one on early Greek science, but it was equally dry. I particularly liked the section on technology, but the others are also good; good but dry. I was a little disappointed by the Ptolemy chapter because I was expecting a more in-depth treatment of the Ptolemaic system.I have mentioned twice that I felt that the book was dry, by this I mean that it was slow reading and not as interesting as I had hoped. Nonetheless, I am giving the book 4 stars. While dry, the book contains a lot of very interesting information and was worth the time that I spent on with it."
1,"Disjointed, spelling and typo errors, nice CD though","I was really disappointed when I read this book. I wondered if the author proofed the copy before it was published because I found both grammatical and spelling errors. Did they use a vanity press?I sympathize with the loss the author incurred. Losing your family has to be an awful experience. But I can't honestly recommend this book.I honestly feel that this book had potential, but given the errors it comes across as simply a way for someone to make money off of this tragedy."
4,A very detailled historical research,"The book is an excellent and very detailled history of the operations flown by the Banff and Dallachy wings from 09/44 to the end of WWII.The amount of research made is quite impressive, with a lot of first hand accounts.But the way its written doesn't make it very exciting."
3,Companion Product.,"A video produced by the Royal Air Force Museum ""The Mosquito"" may be of interest to readers of ""A Separate Little War"". The final 8 or so minutes of the film features a shipping strike by one or more units from a northern base attacking targets obviously in the fijords of Norway.The entire video is 45 minutes long and in black and white.Check this site for availability; I got mine from a supplier in Canada (where over 1,000 Mossies were made)."
4,Mob Enforcer,"I got this game for a grand total of less than $1.10. So already, it's doing well. For the price I paid (or even if I paid a bit more), this product has exceeded my expectations. I have not completed the game, but it is exciting, fun to play and is a pretty great game overall.The only annoying thing is the action key (to open doors, etc) is a bit inconvenient to use.Other than that, the game is great. You can find this game for pretty cheap (as I did). There are 10 levels and 9 ""authentic weapons."" It is easy to learn how to play. I definitely recommend this product; it's cheap, simple, and fun."
3,parker scorgie,A cool gangster game with cool levels and weapons like tommyguns colt45 pistol and shotguns.The graphics are ok but when you use the sniper rifel in aim mode the aiming site could not even be on the enemy it will still kill him.so it is ok but buy mafia instead its better................
5,Fabulous,This was my favorite book as a teenager and after re-reading it again in my 20's I remembered why. It is about Theresa a young lady who is distraught about her life and runs away from home. On the road she picks up two hitchikers who change her life... Definitely Pike at his best!
2,Missing good songs,"I can't believe all the good songs they did not include.The best song that is playing as Jennifer Anston walks along the sidewalk with the name carvings on the trees and while in the coffee shop is ""I'm With You"" by Avril Lavigne which is also missing from this soundtrack.The one playing during the restaurant scene where he doesn't propose is ""If I Ruled the World"" Performed by Tony Bennett"
3,I know the title of the song!,It is called 'Chariots of Fire' from Vangelis. Glad to help you all that were looking for it!
5,John Debney!,"The only reason, and I say again the only reason I gave this soundtrack 5 stars is for John Debney's magnificent musical score. Enough said."
3,A pedestrian approach to security design,"This book has pretty low level info.If you are looking for ways to secure a high level executive's office suite using the principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, forget it. The examples in this book are more at the level of bus stops.Hopefully the authors will update their information with modern design scenarios."
3,"It's just okay - not great, would try a different one next time","It fits on all the seats well so that is a plus when you have different shaped toilets. The handles are good, but because they adjust when you clean this water/cleaner can get inside and then the interior gets wet and it leaks out slowly - ewww. It sits a little high, okay if you have a child with long legs. Works fine for boys and girls equally. Because pee gets trapped it does need to be cleaned often."
1,A totall MESS of a seat,"We did a potty ring instead of a small children's potty to avoid some clean up. Little did I know that this seat would be a total catastrophe. There is no splash guard and the pee gets all over the bottom of the seat, making taking it on and off the toilet a big mess that involves a lot of cleaning and wiping every time. My son does like the handles and the fact that it is padded, but I don't think it's worth the mess."
2,A MIXED BAG,"There are a few fun songs on this CD but for the most part it isn't that thrilling. ""Coconut"" and ""Got to Give It Up"" are fun and I also liked tracks 4, 7, and 9 well. The rest are kind of a mixed back...but the intrumental music is pretty good."
4,Great!!!,Wow! a fantastic albub all the music is great ( exept black eyed dog and is this real) you can really picure the film in your head as it is playing check out the theme tune it is really groovy I would definatally recomend this album to any one who has seen the movie and I would reccomend the movie to any one!!!I didn't regret buying this and I don't think i ever will
4,great book on black female elected officials,"Too often, authors speak of blacks getting the right to vote, when in reality, it was only black men who could do so until 1920. Similarly, to this day, all the blacks are men and all the women are white, when it comes to talk about elected officials. Finally, here is a book to break the silence. McCain Gill discusses each black women that has ever been elected to Congress by the mid-1990s. Her style is journalistic and biographical. This would be a great book for all women of color majoring in political science. Further, for sistas thinking about running for office, this is a great tool for learning about the passages that have already been cleared for you. This book may seem a little dated now. Too, I wish someone would write a book like this that mentions all women of color, not just blacks. Still, I enjoyed this book and I thank McCain Gill (a woman, unlike another review suggests)for this positive contribution to womanist studies."
4,Olympus kit and metal strap,Case and battery worth the price in the kit instead of separately. Metal strap too long and slippery on the shoulders.
4,Two shortened concerts,"This disc contains music from two different concerts in San Francisco. Both are shortened. The 1949 concert with Svanholm can be found complete on Naxos. Both singers are in top form.The excerpts from 1950 gives us three songs by Richard Strauss, seldom sung by Flagstad. They are performed in an impressing way.The final scene from G√∂tterd√§mmerung is better with Furtw√§ngler 1952/EMI. It's good here but perhaps a bit uninspired.The photo on the CD is fascinating. Flagstad looks as she has given up all hope and is jailed behind bars!"
5,love gershwin BUT...,"This CD is amazing but just so you know, there are not 26 tracks even though it lists 26 different songs...There are instead beautiful medleys of wonderful Gershwin."
5,wavelet made easy,This is an excellent book. Wavelet IS a quite advanced concept in Math. The author did a good job to minimize the math backgrond needed to understand wavelet. DON'T BLAM author because you have way too little math training.
5,Great Solution for Hard-to-Find Product,"I live in Singapore & have never been able to find these white nail pencils here. What a great surprise to find them on my old friend Amazon! Sephora delivered just what I needed, right on time. Thanks!"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected a careful, general overview of the various uses of technology in music. This book is clearly for a classroom that uses Macs and the specific software indicated. There is not one entry for Finale, nor microphone/recording techniques. The book is pretentious in its organization (academic music ed. types) and woefully lacking in providing the required general overview of concepts, and prefers to teach specific software applications, many of which are not mainstream."
5,Great 1st dance,Surprised our daughter and she loved it for her 1st dance with her father.nice keepsake for her to kep inherent wedding box of memories
1,Really took me (a)back,"It took me the longest time to figure out what this recording reminded me off, but it finally came to me. Back in high school a buddy of mine had this old lp from like the 1950s entitled ""Poitier Meets Plato."" It was Sidney Poitier giving dramatic readings of passages from Plato's Republic to backing tracks of hokey beatnik bongo jazz, real beret-and-goatee-groovy-daddy-o kind of stuff. The mega-solemnity of the spoken part and the cheesiness of the musical part made for a hysterically funny combination. It made us laugh to the point of physical pain. This record has something of the same thing going on, but it's nowhere near as much fun. I'd give big money to get my hands on the Poitier/Plato album again."
5,Remarkably Easy Listen,"This record is an entirely original breath of fresh air. It makes you feel good about life, and is highly inspirational. Listen for yourself; it's a great work."
2,Not Country Dancing,Although the cover has a country title the lessons are more of a ballroom style. Very dissapointed that the Cha Cha was not a cowboy cha cha.
2,Not the usual Ferry,"I have to admit Im a huge Ferry fan,but this 2 disc set just doesnt do it for me.This is alot calmer than im used to.With the exception of a few songs,the entire album is kinda boring,and totally different from the rest of his albums.I remember after watching the ""Right of Way""DVD he said that he will no longer be doing mixed compilations and will focus more on ""studio"" albums in the future.Epic trance is what put this dj on the map,so if you want some of his best trance stuff check out ""Mixed Live @ Spundae,LA"" or some of the ""Global Trancemissions""series.Also if your a fan of electronica,techno and trance pick up his Right of Way""album...you wont be sorry you did.This album explores more of the techno side with a few hints of trance thrown in between.I really DONT recommend this album."
4,Sweet,"Sweet voice, great lyrics, and a melody so sweet you'll be singing in your sleep. She'll wake you up from a pleasant dream.Can't seem to get tired of this album - it comes back to me regardless of the mood. Plus, I love the fact that it goes to show age has nothing to do with maturity. An old soul lies within Sonya Kitchell's songs.Thank you for sharing this gift with us!"
4,good overview of Josephus,"I'm no scholar, just a layperson. But I enjoy learning and facts. I was familiar with Josephus in a vague type of way and knew his writings gave us much background and history for understanding New Testament life and times. And I wanted to learn more about Josephus and his writings. This book seemed the best option. It was somewhat ""hard"" reading for me, but I feel it was worth my efforts. The author, in my opinion, is somewhat on the theological liberal side. (I'm very conservative...) But I felt the book gave me a good overview of Josephus. It was what I was looking for..."
5,Worth it!,This Album is excellent. I recieved it from my sister when it was still in Promo. Many of my friends always ask me who this is when I play it during parties. It's very lounge/ chill/ ambient type music. Her voice is etherial and haunting. I suggest this to anyone who enjoys good female vocals with light electronic beats.
5,GREAT RE-RELEASE,THIS CD WAS GREAT WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED IN 1992 AND TEN YEARS LATER IT IS BETTER THAN EVER IT STILL HAS ALL OF THE SAME TRACKS INCLUDING A REVISITED VERSION OF THE HARDWAY WHICH IS STILL THE SAME EXCEPT IT IS MORE UP TEMPO THAN THE ORIGINAL YOU ALSO GET A FEW AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACKS WHERE THEY TALK ABOUTLUV IS A VERB SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE AND MICHAEL TAIT'S HAIR THE WAY IT WAS ON THE COVER OF FREE AT LAST. THIS IS REALLY GOOD
5,"Beautiful Edition About Columbus' Ships. HIgh Quality Foldouts of Pinta and ""Santa Maria""","This is a beautiful edition printed on high quality paper, regarding the ships of Christopher Columbus. Detailed cutaways and cross-sectionals of the ships, their cargo holds, crew quarters and other details are in two large foldouts in the middle of the book. Particularly the Pinta and Santa Maria. Elsewhere in the book are details of the Nina.Originally in Italian and translated into English for this edition, the book is a treasure trove of interesting facts and details and a must for the history buff, nautical book collector or anyone interested in the lore of the sea.That such a long voyage could be made in such small ships is astonishing.This book chronicles some of the technical details at the start of the age of oceanic exploration and discovery."
3,A murder mystery at sea,"I purchased this novel anticipating some amount of naval action. While it does contain some action, the author's knowledge of the subject seems to be lacking in some respects. He speaks of cannon being run out, loaded, and run back in, and of bar shot consisting of two bars connected by a chain (I can't imagine anyone trying to fire that mess from a cannon - bar shot was two half spheres connected by a short bar).The main story concerns the feud between two officers, and the murder of an officer aboard a Royal Navy ship. Much of the action seems unlikely, but officers could become tyrants aboard their own ships. A captain commiting piracy by taking supplies from a British ship and then sinking the ship would almost certainly end his career (especially an officer without influence).The story becomes a matter of intrigue aboard the ship, with various factions, secret routes, a hidden compartment, etc. The plot is based on some of the more evil aspects of Royal Navy service."
4,Study pictures...,"Not professionally installed, did you notice brake cable hanging on right side of bike? I am sure torque values are way off too. I have seen this bike at store. Buy it if you want to collect a rare bike. But if I were you, I would keep it hanging on the wall. At that value you are better off going to local store to get a better bike for that price. You'll get professional installation, free adjustments for a year and most likely adjusted for a better fit, did I mention all for free!!"
1,THIS IS A JOKE,"Are you kidding? Why on earth would anyone want to buy this CD. Use Your Illusion I & II could be the two greatest rock and roll albums of all time. Together, they are a masterpiece. This thing doesn't have Breakdown, Get in the Ring, You Could Be Mine, Back Off B*itch, and most important COMA. No true fan should buy this over the two original albums....on the other hand, this came out in 1998...no true fan should be buying the albums seven or more years after they were released anyway. If you go with this one, you really are ripping yourself off."
3,"A ""best of"" from 2 albums?","Made in USA in 1998, Serial# GEFD-24463, Playing Time 63:52The best thing about this CD is the idea for the cover that merges the artwork from the individual ""Use Your Illusion 1"" and ""Use Your Illusion 2"" CDs.If you're on a tight budget, it's worth it, and you can be the proud owner of the edited version of ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"", the full version being on the original CD ""UYI 2"". Or if you're a die-hard GNR fan, you'll have to buy this for the very same reason.Releasing the albums as a pair was somewhat daring, and I can't say I like everything on them. But each of them has some material that unfortunately didn't make it on this ""compilation"".I'm by no means a big GNR fan, but I think you should do yourself a favor: buy both separately, and forget about this compilation."
3,wHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL?,WHY THEY FELT THEY HAD TO RERELEASE THE TWO ALBUMS IT SMUSH'EM TOGETHER IS BEYOND ME .The 2 seperate is better plus some of my favorite songs are missing.If I was just starting to listen to G n'R I would be missing out on great some songs. Don't fix if it ain't broke!!!!!
4,Very catchy stuff,"In my experience, CD collections of any genre tend to be a roller coaster ride - the listener is forced to sift through a significant percentage of mediocre numbers to mine the true gems. This disk, while not uniformly brilliant, is consistently entertaining and provides a good way to get turned on to some talented artists wallowing in relative obscurity. I'm a big Dave Alvin fan, and his track is my favorite on the record. This is a slow, achingly soulful acoustic number that departs from his barrelhouse rock leanings to great success. The Greg Brown and Guy Davis tracks are also standouts. I bought this CD for next to nothing - it was beside the cash register for about five bucks - but price aside, this is a keeper. I recommend it."
3,1999 Cabrio,"Like the Haynes manual this book also does not cover the later 1999 Cabrio models.The engine is simalar but the interior, lighting and more are all very different, this is mainly because there was a big mid-year change but they are all 1999 models."
5,Great manual,"Thanks, needed wiring diagram for vr6. this one told me where my problem was. This one was used, but in great shape."
3,Bentley manual,"I'm honestly not very impressed with this manual. Write up aren't very informative, few supportive photos, missing information on models. I personally have found this manual to be lacking some information. Most other car manuals I have found provide much more indepth details and photos. This manual is best used by someone who already has a good knowledge about a particular vw. I also found this manual does not provide some information about my vehicles components which were factory installed options.I did find this manual helpful for noting torque specs on various items, with some heavy searching throughout the manual."
1,The worst editing of any live show,"Here is a great band performing ,evidenly ,two sets.The first set ends at track 5 of 19 tracks.There are no introductions,applause or much else to give a live feel to the show.The CD will contain 74 minutes of music ,this producer only uses 47 minutes ,or so.There are at least three other live CD's available,such as ""Okie from Muskogee"" and the Philidelphia show ,that show what a live CD should sound like.I just saw Merle in person six months ago,he is still powerful,and carries a good band.Don't waste your money on this CD,buy a ticket and see him live."
4,Legion by William Peter Blatty,"It was a good read. Not great, but good. The main character was the police lt. that was in the first story, and the movie. I love him."
1,Falls apart,I purchased two of these this several years ago for both of my kids and it started falling apart soon after I purchased them. It has now completely fallen apart. The dividers are torn and the front of it has completely separated from the rest of the portfolio. I didn't move it around very much either. It's not worth the money.
4,Small price to keep using your laptop,"The color is just barely off, but by now most of the powerbooks in the world are pretty banged up anyway. It fits, it looks decent, it powers your computer. What else do you want? If you want to hang on to your powerbook for a little while longer, throw down the 50 dollars and get one of these... otherwise go grab a new macbook pro."
3,Not Even Close- you get what you pay for.,"Some helpful information:-the bottom cover is PLASTIC, not the original aluminum, thus the color is noticeably off.-the casing does not fit well and the battery sticks out a bit.-the indicator lights and button works well; time will tell if they are accurate.-the rubber foot is in the correct spot and is the right size.-the information tag is cheaply glued on and pulling it back easily reveals the power cells. Not very significant, but interesting.The only saving grace for this product was the price.Item was ordered Sunday night and arrived the next Saturday. Not extremely fast, but fast enough. Product came from the nebulous ""power_direct"" and there was never any contact from the seller.The battery has a charge but I will not know what the life is like until I use it more extensively. Gets the job done but it's not as beautiful as the original product! :)"
1,"Great at first, then really bad. As in not-even-working-at-all bad.","This battery was inexpensive and worked really well at first. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not the exact color of the PowerBook G4 body, but that doesn't matter.I enjoyed the long battery life for about the first three weeks, but then it went from 100% capacity to 92% capacity almost overnight.Then, yesterday, it stopped taking a charge while my Mac was plugged in. There was nothing wrong with my power cords or the Mac itself--it charged my older battery fine this morning. But this product will not charge.I'll be returning it."
1,Avoid this brand. Look elsewhere,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who owns the 12"" powerbook. The battery worked for about a month then absolutely nothing. Construction seems cheap (the button to check battery level is recessed, and cannot be pressed with just a finger), and the adhesive for the glued on labels is puckered.There are many bad reviews for this model, and I wish there had been last year when I bought it."
3,toolbox terror,"Far superior in every way to Tobe Hoopers new version, Cameron mitchell stars as the balaclava wearing drill/nailgun weilding maniac who for the first 20 minutes or so lovingly despatches a host of maidens with a different tool in his box everytime. This film is very grisly and is still unavailable uncut in most places, apart from the states of course. After the opening sequences the film becomes a bit mundane and plods along extremely slowly developing into a kidnap drama with a psycho twist but Mitchell is superb and strangely - for an ex-cowboy - extremely believable as the tormentor, the rest of the acting is pretty appalling as you would come to expect from these types of movies but the gore scenes at the begginning are quite shocking, especially the nail-gun scenario. Blue underground havedone a great job of cleaning up the image and is a very worthwhile addition to the horror genre."
2,Too long and Too Drawn Out-,"I watched this with my wife hoping it would be an entertaining love story and was disappointed. Neither my wife or I enjoyed this movie. The storyline is not great, it needed something more to keep it interesting for the duration. Half way through we were ready for it to be over. The acting was not bad it but the dialog and story progression needed a lot of work. WARNING: I WILL BE GIVING AWAY WHAT THE STORY IS MAINLY ABOUT SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE.The whole point of the movie was to develop the obvious point that her love is gone and must now move on was unoriginal and boring. It was too drawn out and deserves no where close to the 4 stars it averages on this site."
3,"Romantic, depressing and disappointing","My Irish wife was in the mood for a romance, and thought we would enjoy this film, but she fell asleep about half way through.I managed to watch it all but came away more sad than warmed, as it is a movie more about resolution and loss than about love. The message in the film is a common one, that you should let those you love in on your secret every day, not expect that they know it.But that's just me.Now my wife watched all the way through yesterday with our youngest daughter, and she really liked it after all. But she is a big believer in not getting over your true love (me too, but that's not the way I saw this turn). My bigger problem was the conclusion of the film where it reminded me of when my wife's Ford Expedition was stolen, she wanted another Ford Expedition. After you watch the film you may see what I mean... I felt like the inferred afterward in the story was kind of twisted along the same line.But again, that's just me."
5,The Ultimate Tear Jerker,"Hilary Swank is such a versatile actress. Is there a role she can't play well? In PS - I Love You, she plays Holly, a young widow who's lost the love of her life to cancer. Gerry, her husband, knows his death is going to be hard on her and arranges a year's worth of letters and gifts to be delivered to Holly at specific occasions.The year sees Holly take an emotional roller coaster ride. At time she completely withdraws and friends and family go from concern to just having enough of it and moving on without her. In the end, with the last letter from Gerry telling her get on with it, and a heart to heart with her mom, Holly rejoins the world, reconnects with her friends and finds a new path for herself."
2,Pass on this one,"I wasn't sure if it looked interesting by the trailer, but I saw it had decent reviews and rented it...It started out holding my attention but the last 40 minutes were brutal! It became so slow and jumps all over the place. I would not recommend this."
5,Incredible Romantic not just a chick flick,This movie is very good. Lots of laughs and some tears for us ladies. My boyfriend plans on buying a copy as well so there is enough in there for the guys to make for a great movie to watch with your significant other.
5,Chick flick,This was a delightful movie. Lovely story line with a good ending. Excellent if you want a good cry. Excellent acting
1,Don't Expect to finish watching,"This is a slow moving film. We started one night and tried to finish the next, but Amazon cut off the movie in mid-viewng blaming the ""copyright holder"", so we paid $3.99 to watch a $15 boring movie and we couldn't even see the ending.Advice: Don't use Amazon Unbox. 24 hours is harsh when it's as rigorously enforced as it is with eletronic delivery. We should have at least been permitted to finish watching a movie we were actively watchng when it was cut off.We weren't allowed to finish the movie and you won't either. It's $3.99 lost forever on a sucker deal. Be prepared to lose your investment."
4,I'm not outwardly sensitive and I really liked it.,"I said I wouldn't like it at first, then I found my self really liking it. I reccommend you watch it with girlfriend or wife..."
5,Best Movie,"The movie was delivered fairly quick, always seems to take longer when you want something fast, but it ws delivered just as seller stated. The quality is great, brand new DVD, nothing damaged, GREAT MOVIE GREAT LOW PRICE"
3,Not really a Comedy,Interesting Premise Good Acting and some beautiful scenery but this has very serious overtones I would not call it a comedy but that being said it not a bad movie and I think Harry Connick may steal the movie. Kathy Bates is also very good as the mother Worth a look
5,Best girly movie!,"I have loved this movie for a long time and decided I wanted to watch it, when... low and behold, my DVD collection didn't include this movie! AHHH! I immediately went to Amazon and purchased the blu-ray. If you're on the fence about buying this movie, take the plunge. It's lighthearted and sentimental all at the same time--you'll laugh through the tears! LOVE IT!"
4,P.S. I love this movie!,This is definitely a perfect movie for when you need a good cry. Have a girls night in and enjoy!
2,Sappy love.,Has it's moments. Good soundtrack and great looks of beautiful Ireland. But its pretty much too far over-the-top.The attempted connection with Harry Connick Jr. was pretty disgusting.
4,best widow movie!,Five years ago I became a widow. While watching this movie I cried like a baby. The parts where they show her feeling his touch and hearing his voice was oh so real I could relate. Loved It!!!!
3,"P.S., Wha???","This is a pleasant romantic comedy. Gerry Butler is certainly engaging enough as the male half of the equation. Hillary Swank plays such a high-pressure female always flying off the handle and finding it hard to relax. It was hard for me to see any chemistry between her and Butler or anyone else for that matter. There are some beautiful shots of Ireland in the Blu-Ray transfer, and the sound is quite nice. The story line is based on a very comprehensive plot that Butler concocts, that I find difficult to believe he could have forseen or even afforded to pull the scheme off. The whole magilla kind of peters out in the last reel and ends fortuitously for all (almost as if the studio had to call it quits on the film and end it happily). Enjoyable, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it (it's a date movie after all--cleverly designed to make us guys feel totally inadequate)."
2,All the ingredients but half-baked,"I search for movies I can watch with my teen children and the reviews indicated this would be allright. What they didn't say was that Harry Connick's character talked about using prostitutes, and having two ex-girlfriends who are now in a relationship with each other. In an odd twist, Swank's character (while receiving letters from her deceased husband) has a one-night stand with a man she's just met. Please! After being married to Gerard Butler? Kathy Bates (mom) could have added a badly-needed element of depth to show Swank's journey through grief. Lisa Kudrow, as Hilary's pal, was a shallow one-dimensional character who was ruthlessly looking for a man to marry - another misfire which could have been developed to add depth and contrast to Swank's grieving process if her character had been better developed. There were touching moments between Butler and Swank, and it was a great cast and concept, but the tacky elements left a bad taste."
2,Waste of time,"Any movie that starts with a juvenile fight between two lovers should be a sign that it will not be a great indulgence on the behalf of the movie/DVD watcher. This film is one of those. Even the assemble of the superior female cast of actresses like: Hilary Swank, Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon cannot save this movie. Love between two people is universal and we all love differenly. But the idea of arranging fun outings for the remaining spouse after the other one is long gone, is spooky if anything else. Mourning is personal and we deal with it in our own ways and having friends and family involved in some scheduled string of fun outings is just plain weird. If you are a fan of the romantic comedy there are better ones out there that this one. You can skip this one and not regret it at all."
4,Great Christmas Gift,I ended up using the Movie as a Dirty Santa gift with a bunch of ladies. It was a great gift all the ladies I know LOVE this movie.
5,"Fantastic, just watch it!!","This movie has it all in my opinion. very touching story, great romance, beautiful scenery (Ireland), gorgeous men (Gerard Butler, Jeffrey Dean Morgan), uplifting ending, although rather sad in parts, great acting (Hilary Swank is magical in this role!). It starts out slow but keeps getting better and better."
4,Good Movie. Not Enough of Gerard Butler,"I enjoyed the movie. It made me laugh and made me cry. However, there aren't enough scenes with the delightful Gerard Butler. He's very entertaining, and I wish they would have used him more."
5,It will toy with your emotions...,"Okay, like many other people here I (glancing over both my shoulders) love this movie. It will make you laugh really hard and make you cry even harder. From concept, to the acting, and on through editing, it is a finely crafted film. Why, I am actually starting to make myself gag over all this gushing and the guy in the next cubby is totally staring. Watch this then then buy it. It is a keeper. Oh yeah, you'll want to bring tissue! :o)"
3,Made the mistake of reading the book before watching the movie...,"I think if you watch the movie without reading the book, then you'll like the movie a lot. However, if you're like me and love to read the books behind movies, you will be very disappointed with this movie. If you liked the movie and want to go more into depth with the story, I would read the book! The best part of the movie was Gerard Butler - definitely made the movie. I just can't really see him falling for Hilary Swank though; she's too manly looking! She is a great actress though...just casting could have been better."
1,Disappointing,If you plan on reading the book or you have read the book DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I loved the book and read it in less than a week but when I watch this movie I almost turned it off. I was sooo disappointed in how far away from the real story that this movie went. You may like it if you don't ever intend to read the book.
4,Cried and Laughed...Really Liked the Movie!,"I'm not the greatest movie reviewer. I'll be honest about that up front. I tend to watch movies purely for my enjoyment and will usually rate it based on that alone. I rarely judge the acting, the script, the development of plot, etc. I really enjoyed watching this movie because it had ""a little of everything""--something I personally need in a movie. It made me laugh and cry. It had seriousness and lightheartedness. The only disconnect I had was at the beginning of the movie. The plot seemed to make a jump and I was left with a few questions. I wondered if I missed something in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Overall, though, it was a movie that I'd watch again and recommend to my girlfriends. Not sure if it'd be a movie my hubby would watch with me, though."
4,Much better than I expected,I found PS I Love you to be sad and happy at the same time. Loved the back-flashes that seemed to fill in the blanks in a timely manner. Gerard Butler and Hillary Swank made a good pair. Too bad we didn't get to see more of Butler. Worth the purchase.
5,Great guys! Great album!,"A friend of mine and I followed the Limbeck band all over Iowa during our college years and still enjoy their music, finding them around in our respective cities whenever we can. I'm living in Boston now and hope to see them out on the opposite coast sometime. They're a fun group who loves what they do, and it shows in their music. The music is catchy, fun, but super unique. Listening to their albums (""Let Me Come Home"" and ""Hi, Everything's Great"" are favorites) is like going on a road trip with a bunch of your best friends. Flannel and t-shirts... vinyl... good music... good fun... Have fun! You'll love it."
2,"Okay John, so you had a baby...","... and don't we get to hear about it. Gorka takes his subjects a bit too literally for those who don't want to know too much about the man himself. But there are some decent songs on this album - January Floor for instance is light and catchy, just right. Poduction on this album is noticably more in your face than usual and none the better for it. It's also a bit too obvious that some of the percusion was put on afterwards. Not a bad effort, but the last one was better and the one before better still. Careful now Mr Gorka."
1,"My Kodak Error ""E45"" Moment","For those of you interested in buying a LS-443, keep it in mind that in about 2 years time this camera will break. NO MATTER WHAT.I brought this camera from Amazon.com for $400.00 in 2003. Normally, I would expect a camera with this kind of price tag to last for.. oh, I don't know... at least 5 years! But silly me, I was wrong.Kodak will not fix this camera for you if it breaks. Instead, they will tell you to buy a new one.If you are looking to pay big for a camera with a life span of 2 years then, Kodak is for you."
1,chuck it now,"ENOUGH SAID HERE ""E45"" HOW ABOUT KOCRAP AND BUY A FUJI FINE PIX...QUALITY IS INCLUDED IN THE PRICE !!!!"
2,lens won't open,"One month after warranty expired (1 year), the lens no longer opens. Just a clicking noise when you turn the camera on, like gears slipping.Took pretty good photos while it lasted, but $400 for one year's photos is a bad deal."
2,Not recommended,"I know nothing about cameras, so bought this because it is meant to be so easy to use. I sell real estate so wanted it to photograph houses etc. nothing fancy. However, the colours are really awful... nothing like the real life ones my friends get with other cameras. The blue skys usually comes out looking like a thunderstorm is on the way. I live in Portugal where its very bright sun. I was told I can adjust exposure and stuff, but I bought it because it is so heavily promoted as being so easy to use. Recently my camera (in a soft case) fell off the dashboard of my car, onto the car floor..Ok, I know its my fault.. but such a short fall onto a car carpet, broke the small multifuncion button. The camera still works ok, but the loose button keeps putting on the maginifying mode when Im reviewing pictures.. Didnt think it would be such a fragile little thing. If you need a camera for work, I don't think this is the one."
1,#E45 Error Message,"Reading through these reviews, I think I may have set a new record for this camera. I bought one in December 2002 and it went wrong in June 2006. I make that 3.5 years before it died. Does this qualify me for a prize? Same thing as others -stuck open with blue screen displaying error #E45. My views are similar to those of the many others who weren't so ""lucky"". Good easy camera to use with reasonable quality, but its reliability is very poor. I'm going to replace it with one from a proper manufacturer."
4,Pedometer Saver,This little tool is a handy way for me to hang on to my pedometer. too many times the clip on the pedometer pops off my waist band and it is gone. This leash keeps it from getting lost by making me take quick notice if it is no longer attached to may waist band. My only complaint was that the merchange mailed in an envelope with .44 postage and I had to pay the post office another $1.27. Don't mind paying - just would rather pay up front than at delivery.
1,Waste of money,"The Safety leash for Pedometer was a total waste of money. The item was poorly constructed with poor quality materials. I could have made it in my basement and done a better job at a fraction of the cost. In addition, the pedometer came with a Safety Leash included. I would send it back but the shipping cost is greater that the purchase price of this piece of elastic with a clip on one end. DON'T BUY, DON'T, DONT'T BUY."
3,It's handy.,This is not as good as the original. Shame on the company for not sending what came originally with the product!!!
2,Minimal design,"I purchased a Fit Bit and was offered this product as an accessory to prevent loss. Well the pedometer has no provision for attaching this accessory, OOPS"
1,A disappointment,"Enjoyed using it for 2 weeks, and then it broke. It is not possible to repair it. Very flimsy."
5,Satisfied Customer,I am very please with the quality of the leash and speed of delivery. I would order from this seller again.
2,Bulky and Unnecessary,"I bought this safety leash for my Fit Bit. But it added a lot of unnecessary bulk. Plus, the Fit Bit stays my waistband on just fine without the leash even when I am running and working out at the gym. This leash was a waste of money."
1,broke right away,My son was over and set my pedometer and put the safety leash on right away and it must have broken within the first day or two.
1,LASTED 3 HOURS BEFORE IT BROKE,"I bought this strap to reinforce the one on my new pedometer. It has a metal clasp that attaches to your waistband. The first time I used it, the strap broke away from the metal clasp and I found the pedometer with the strap in my pocket and the clasp alone attached to my waistband. Luckily the pedometer was in my pocket. I'm still using the strap after tying it with several knots to the clasp. However, if my pedometer had not been a pocket model, it would have been lost on the first day. I would not recommend this strap to anyone."
1,Was not worth the money.,"While I did not spend a lot of $ on this product, it came to me apart and there was no putting together. Item was supposed to keep my ""FitBit"" close by, but I could not use it. Ended up throwing away.No, I would not recommend to a friend."
1,Wiiiieeeer!!! (cat sound),"Highly elitist and superficial. The premise of this book is that all conservative women are evil and have accomplished their goals by deceit. She promotes choice on abortion but not choice on politial parties. She is merciless and holier than thou with those who don't agree with her. She falls into lockstep with the anti-Halliburton, I hate Bush garbage. She shamelessly attacks Laura Bush's personal tragedy (car crash) and politicization of that was beyond the pale.If you want a fair characterization of conservative women this is not it, but if you want insignificant catty vitriol, order this book yesterday."
1,An Editorial Between Hardcovers,"You can read this stuff on the editorial page of your morning newspaper. You can read it FREE on dozens of web-sites. The best thing that can be said about this book is that you could probably read it while doing something else. It delivers little in the way of information, requires no thought, and exercises only some easy emotions. Why people pay money for these things is beyond me."
5,Panamax Surge Protector,I purchased this surge protector after consulting with Panamax technical services. There are very few surge protectors that can provide protection for fractional horsepower motors in addition to sensitive electronics. I needed this type of protection for a new boiler.This is my seventh Panamax product and I have never had damage to items protected by Panamax.
4,A View From 1851,"This is a fascinating view of the most important battles as seen from the perspective of 1851. I'm not quite sure what Jetpack's criticism of the book is, since it was written over 160 years ago and should not be expected to reflect modern sensibilities.While many of us are at least aware of the battle of Marathon, the battle of Arbela and Metaurus are not nearly so well remembered today. Look back a century and a half to see what they thought, which were the most important conflicts, and how they saw them.Well worth downloading and spending a quiet evening in the company of Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy. His view is very Eurocentric, and his faith is a reflection of ""Musclular Christianity"", a concept popular at the time of this books creation. This was written in the heyday of the ""New Imperialism"" that saw European, American, and Asian expansion that went well into the the 20th century and culminated in World War II."
3,Hard to read,Very factual but very dry. The writer too often went on tangents that added several pages that were unnecessary. I did enjoy the book.
5,Safety Video,This movie was great in that it taught my three year old how to remember her phone number and what to do if she's lost in a store. I love having this movie on hand since it sends a message that needs to be heard over and over. As usual sesame street does a great job getting the point across while keeping it simple and entertaining.
2,the average talent pool is getting way to full,"Here we are with yet another band that lacks any originality. Ofcourse the lyrics are different from other bands but then again, that's why we have copyrights. Two stars for their efforts as it is hard to have originality in this day and age however that doesn't excuse them for making very average music. Not bad but not good either. This band will be just another band needing exposure to masses before other bands of the same caliber do in order to survive. To sum up...AVERAGE."
4,Geat cd to buy!,"This cd is loaded of good songs. The first song i listen on TV was ""Guilt"", what a good song. When i got the cd i was suprised it had 15 songs especially a new band like ""Fingertight"". When i started to listen to the cd numbers 1-5 are great songs, even 6 is mellow, the rest of the songs are good. I have over 500 cd's from rock to metal and when i looked at the front cover of the album i was kind of disapointed on the picture, but i did end of buying it and it was definetly worth it. Rating it a 4 might be a understapement, but when you hear as many cd's i do, it is kind of hard to give it a 5. I encourage you to go buy this cd it is worth it."
4,Very enjoyable and comprehensive biography,"I'm not a big fan of biographies, but Pearce does a fine job here. Part of it obviously is due to the wonderful man he is dealing with, a splendidly witty writer who perfected the paradox and dared to insert common sense into politics. The material on the younger Chesterton isn't too interesting, but Pearce succesfully explains Chesterton's views, reviews all his major writings, covers his personal life well and gives fair space to Chesterton's critics as well as his friends (though the two were often one and the same, such as Shaw and Wells, as the book points out). A very good introduction into the life of Chesterton and recommended for anyone interested in him or anyone who doesn't know anything of this great man."
1,Avoid this book at all costs!,"There is nothing but one-side christian propaganda here. Especially on the article regarding pornography. It has the typical right wing christian response toward it. ""Any porn whatosever is wrong...blah blah blah.Just for that i'll replace my addiction to the net...by smoking cigarettes."
4,For all you English Patient fans...,"... you definitely will not be disappointed with Saul Kelly's THE LOST OASIS. I'm three chapters into the book and it's a fascinating recount of the true members of the Zerzura Club. If you're an English Patient fan like I am, you won't be disappointed either. It sheds light on places and topics mentioned by Ondaatje, such as the Gilf Kebir, the Cave of Swimmers, Zerzura, and even things such as how these early explorers kept their primitive vehicles from getting stuck in the sand. But whether you're an English Patient fan or not, this book stands alone just fine."
1,Doggie Hoots Crakler,Advertised as tough but it did not last but a few hours. Would not recommend for dogs who are chewers. Is not sturdy to withstand chewing. Not as tough as adverstised.
3,decent book,"this book is probably going to be one of the required books for photography in college but it's not a horrible book. not the most exciting, but definitely has enough to get one started with critical thinking about photography and such."
4,"Take that, Andrew Marvell!","No, it's not ""The Last Unicorn"", but you can't recreate the best book in the world, so who cares? ""A Fine and Private Place"" is incredibly winning, philosophical, funny, and poignant. It's about two ghosts who find the love they've been looking for all their lives...after their lives have ended. They're befriended by Mr. Rebeck, the old recluse living in the cemetary, a wise-cracking raven, and a strong-willed widow. It's Beagle's trademark to combine incredibly real, well-rounded, however eccentric, characters with incredibly beautiful, insightful prose. This book is no exception!"
2,the edge is gone,"I enjoyed the Villans CD after first learning about The Verve Pipe watching a VH1 telecast. They were hard hitting and different.With some hesitation I recently purchased ""Underneath"". It is bland and very ordinary. Clearly a concerted effort was made to be more mainstrain and Top 40 radio compliant. Too bad."
5,An excellent album (4 1/2 Stars),"I've listened, to this CD over and over again and can't stop.I had heard ""The Freshmen"" song, but didn't know about these guys.After hearing ""Never Let You Down"" on the radio I got interested and got this CD.This is one of the best alternative rock CD's I have heard in awhile."" Only Words,Never Let You down(upbeat & catchy),Miles Away,Happiness is,Medicate Myself (hard rockin & dark),Gotta Move On & Colorful"" are the songs that really stand out to me.The Alt. Rock jangle then powerful post-grunge guitars and cool druming are all here, but the little things and way it's put together make things stand out.On top of that I really like the lead singer's strong, slightly raspy, but lush voice.Highly recommended as well as their fine ""Villains"" album."
1,Very Bad product/Horrible and expensive,"This product should be taken off the shelves !!!!! Several of the packages were actually moldy but it was hard to tell as the taste was so artificial and horrible anyway.You didn't realize what was wrong until it dawned on you it was moldy throughout the entire cake !!Company was not acessable to contact about the product and the item was only good to throw in the garbage. I couldn't even donate it to a local food pantry, it's so bad."
5,Very funny - and actually has good advice,"The very best Dave Berry -- truth described in a hilarious way. Despite his protestations to the contrary, there is actually good advice here."
3,"Fun enough, but missing something.","I think that this is my first Samantha Adams mystery, and I should say right off the bat that it is not a bad read. If you like a quick-read mystery with snappy dialogue and a few laughs thrown in, then this is a good book for you.Personally, while I enjoyed it, I found it at least a little bit too slick and too glib. I felt like the con man element could have been developed out a little bit more (I liked it-- I felt frustrated when it didn't pan out). And unfortunatly the ending felt a little bit too easy.I will probably read others in the series if I see them available as used books. Mystery fans who like their stories on the cynical/humorous side may find this book appealing."
2,A different perspective,"I just want to add a note of caution to prospective buyers. I can appreciate a book about the internet, business, and the history of the web. If that's what you want, buy this book! Don't read any further!If you are looking for a book on designing a web site however, this may not be the book for you. You have to really search to find good advice, and who has the time? Go out and buy a book like ""Don't Make Me Think?"" by Steve Krug if you want good advice. Buy this book if you're interested in web history."
4,MLP FIM,The sound/video quality of the episodes was very good. I already knew I loved all the episodes on the disk so I was not disappointed. The only thing I can say bad about it is that all of the additional features on the disk are not entertaining at all.
5,Fun with Ponies!,"This DVD is a wonderful addition to any Pony fan's collection. It has some of the greatest episodes, and some great bonus content. I especially enjoyed the extended theme song and the promo spots included in the bonus features. The episodes themselves are in great, crisp quality, ready to be viewed over and over again. This product comes highly recommended for any fan, brony or other."
1,terrible!!,"This DVD is terrible! Why Hasbro would create a new DVD this bad is confusing. Based on the front cover of this with cute happy ponies and the title ""Friendship is Magic"" one would expect fun, fantastical, sweet stories. The first episode in two parts is so scary my 4 yr old refused to watch it. When I checked it out it in fact was filled with bug-eyed animals that lurch out from the darkness and death defying leaps off of cliffs that make the Road Runner look sedate. Intermixed with these creepy, unsettling graphics is bratty superficial dialogue. This could have been so cute...the creative possibilities for this could have been endless. Not sure why any parent would want their kids to watch this."
3,mixed,"The hat looks great, but I bought it as a gift and it doesn't come close to fitting my friend's head, or anyone else I've tried it out on. And the return policy time is so small that I couldn't get a refund."
1,Misleading military analysis and personal political views,"The title of this book gives the impression that expert analysis would be provided. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Ms. Kinzey freely mixes his own opinions of what transpired in Operation Desert Storm with incorrect military analysis to provide what turns out to be a completely unsatisfying book."
3,"Totally Hits- Are they really ""TOTALLY HITS?""","To see if these are actually all hits, as what it claims to be, i have compiled a list of the peak positions of the songs from the billboard hot 100.1.

1,Stale water taffy Not Salt,"I am so disappointed with this purchase. Normally this is my favorite candy because it is so soft and chewy. However, this batch is hard as a rock and stale as ever and much too sweet. Very unhappy!"
5,The Boss Takes The Cake,"Per my sons flute teacher, who happens to be first flute for our most excellent Jacksonville Symphony, I purchased the Boss DB-90. My son absolutely loves it. It is the newest model and can do everything but take out the trash. It has actually encouraged my son to play more as he uses it all the time now and his music sounds so much better. Excellent price, cheapest I could find on the net. Be sure to order the AC adapter to save money on battery purchases."
3,another look at dance,"This work offers the bare basic patterns(box step, underarm turn..rock step)instruction in an interchangeable styling-free approach to the listed dances.Costume and set background colors (black on black) make it difficult, if not impossible for the visual learner to discern the man's (leg and footwork patterns)parts easily.Auditory learners will find The Verbal cues are well articulated and easy to hear.This production might offer a suplemental social dance resource (practice companion)for the student enrolled in a community social dance class."
2,Very disappointing (though not a complete waste of time),"This is a story book about a series of road trips one man made in order to chronicle a set of interesting characters who live in New Orleans, but it is hardly a book that introduces you to ""Voudou in America."" The journalist got so caught up in the personality of one of the women he followed around that he began to absorb her likes and dislikes. The worst part of the book is the writer's insistence on pitting Black American Voudou practitioners against Cuban/Caribbean Santeria practitioners. I think he just got too caught up in the personality politics of his subjects to be objective in the end.Basically, good for stories and to get some general insight from someone who is, to say the very least, not prejudiced against the religion -- BUT just take a few notes, jot down a few names (like ""Luisah Teish"" and ""Ava Kay Jones"") and move on..."
1,What the hell was that?!,"I can tell you from hust looking at the cover of the book that the books is not even about Vodou. The cover shows religious practices of people who work with the Orisa. Not Vodou. Even though I'm going towards my Kanzo ( Vodou Initiation ), I'm not completely ignorant about Vodou. If you want to learn more about traditional Vodou, I would recommend researching Haitian Vodou."
2,Don't bother,"If you know anything at all about voodoo, or voudou, this book will amaze you with it's focus on Santeria and/or it's focus on African voudou. Were this your first reading on the topic, you would, in all likelihood, not read anyting else. While Santeria is popular in this country, it pales in comparison to Haitian voodoo.That having been said, his adventures in New Orleans are entertaining. It just lacks most of the facts about real American Voudou!"
5,Wererats are nasty,this is a good solid bood with good basic ideas and rules. Sensible feats are also included. If you have never really used wererats before this book will give you a lot.
5,JM,"This really works! I have trouble with my thumbs in the morning. I am a bookkeeper by trade and I use my thumbs a lot and the pain was to the point that I could not move them. After taking this product for two weeks, I noticed that the pain was much less and by the end of the bottle, I was in a state of hardly no pain! I say, try it, you might get the same results that I did!"
5,The Ever lovin' Blue Eyed Thing!,Here is another one of those classic VHS tapes from childhood. I would rent these from Captain Video (here in Omaha) and one day I took a chance with my allowance and asked if I could buy one. Low and behold the lady said sure and my collection began.This is one of my absolute favorites because it features an episode almost exclusively devoted to Benjamin Gimm (The Thing). He is kidnapped and taken into space to compete in a gladatorial arena. I enjoy the stories where the hero is on their own removed from their normal habitat and on their own facing foes in a foreign land so to speak.The second episode is a classic from the 1967 Spider-Man featuring a bizarre villain named Skymaster and his floating blimp of ill repute. Tons of fun!If you enjoy these old cartoons then pick this up as they are becoming harder and harder to find. Happy hunting!!
1,this is really bad,"This is the first time I've posted a review of a movie online. I'm an avid fan of horror, fantasy and science fiction and I've seen a lot of movies. I can also tolerate a lot of really bad stuff as long as it has some redeeming qualities--a good plot, good characters, interesting concepts and imaginative settings. Dylan Dog, however, has none of the above. It is devoid of any originality or creativity. This is truly a worthless film. Don't waste a moment of your time watching this mess."
3,I'll probably buy it,"I rented this movie as soon as it was available. As a huge fan of shows like ""Supernatural"" and movies like ""Underworld"", ""Hellyboy"" and ""Resident Evil"", I had been waiting in anticipation to see this movie. It was o.k., but did not live up entirely to expectations, the story line could have been better. Either way it was entertaining and had allot of morbid humor so I will probably end up buying it."
2,Dylan not...,"I have not read the comic books but I am sure that Brandon Routh did not do justice to the character, the acting seemed forced and not natural. It had a good casting overall and the idea of the movie it's good and original.The effects were not bad for a movie that probably did not have much budget for visual effects, the characters looked very interesting, scary and real for the most part. At the end it was an entertaining movie that you can put on the background while you do something else, I am just glad I did not go to the movies to see it."
3,Good for non-beginners,"I bought this DVD for my 4 year old. She enjoys dancing around the house, as well as watching a yoga video that I picked up. This DVD was a bit too advanced for her. Although the teacher shows each position, it still goes too fast for a little one who has never had a dance class. My daughter did enjoy the jazz section, and I caught her trying many of their moves. This DVD is great if your little one already has a little dance background. Be prepared to have tap shoes for the tap section, as the teacher focuses on the sounds that a tap shoe makes. We don't have tap shoes and were practicing on the carpet, making it difficult to fully appreciate the tapping. I will probably put this DVD away and bring it out again when my little one is closer to 5."
2,Bad Production values,Although the kids are cute the production value is like someones home camera. It seems the producers have strung together 3 old videos to make one long tape. The instructor is cold and not endearing which makes me wonder how children can possibly relate to this tape. My child watched it once and now it sites on the shelf. Ebay anyone?
4,A bit too fast for beginners?,"My sister-in-law, a high schooler who has taken a few years of dance classes at a local dance studio, noted that the instructor in this video seems to move a bit too quickly for beginning dancers. My 4-year-old daughter does enjoy the video and tries to follow along, but she definitely is having a hard time picking up most of the moves. It's a hard balance to strike, though, because you want to go slow enough for beginners, yet you also want it to be advanced enough that there's the opportunity for the person who owns the DVD to grow as s/he repeatedly practices with it. So all in all, I'd say it's a well-done video, but buyers need to be aware of what may possibly be too steep of a learning curve."
2,"I dod not like this this DVD, I have a 3 , 7 and 9 year ole and they did not like this DVD, but I am sure it is good for others.","I have an 3, 7 and 9 year girls, they could not follow along with the DVD, it was to fast for them to keep up, but Iam sure it works for some others."
2,Recycled Hipper than Hip,"Let me be the first to warn you all, this is Hipper than Hip in new packaging! To add insult to injury, the original Hipper than Hip is cheaper. I do not dislike Rania, and do have many of her dvd's. However I did not have Hipper than Hip because I never ordered it based on bad reviews. The other reviews are accurate, it may be a faster paced cardio workout than her other dvd's but does not flow well at all. I'm very dissapointed and may actually return the video."
1,Waste of time,I recently bought this DVD and I'm very disapointed. The movie has no story line and lacks any charature devolopment. It is a nonstop blood bath from the first scene. The ending is terrible and only leaves more questions than answered. Send your money else where.
2,A little better than painful to watch,"It really is just an anime about swordfighting and it doesn't even SHOW the swordplay. One moment the two opponents are facing each other, then a still-frame of the opponent yelling, a flash of light, a cool pose by the hero, and blood blood blood. And about half of the fight scenes seem to be random encounters. Just what is the frog-thing with the spear, anyways? If you like this sort of now-he's-living-now-he's-not 'action' than this is a good one. If you're more interested in things like realism and character development (etc etc) then maybe you should watch a different anime."
2,Bad,"This is nothing close to ninja scroll. There's no fluidity in the whole film. Just stay away, I didn't listen, don't make the same mistake... Its BAD!"
1,Totally botched my order and no one answers the phone.,"I ordered this sink a month ago and checked it for damage but did not realize that is was the wrong size. I need a replacement immediately for the item I ordered, the 42"" Kubus sink, but no one answers the phone. Hopefully someone at Home West or Amazon will contact me immediately to make this right!"
3,Game Play = Terrible,"At first you open the game and start to play, it acctually is a cool game intill you decide to play career. It should take you about 3 hours to beat it then there is nothing to do. you start to play other peopl in regular mode but it gets dull. It took me about one week to stop playing the game allogether. SPEN YOUR MONEY ON A MORE ENTERTAINING ITEM"
2,Backward step from the original K.K.,"I was and still am a big fan of the 1st K.K. because it was a fairly lifelike boxing game.I rushed out and bought K.K. 2000 thinking that they could only improve on the original but how I was wrong.The only improvement was the boxers faces and physiques but everything else made playing the game worse.The boxers are far too wooden like and look like they have their feet tied together K.K. 2000 is like an arcade beat em up,press every button till someone drops game.I can only hope that KK 2001 recaptures what the original tried to achieve but I'll be renting first this time."
1,Don't buy,My litle girl used it one time in the tube and it now no longer works and we didint even get to use it in the pool
3,Better than most,"I thought the shark was going to be a bit bigger (only 14 inches) and he takes a while to get started. When you first place him in the water he is lopsided and takes a few minutes to work his way upright. Other than that, it was fun having it in the pool. At one point we couldn't find him, an then several hours later he was discovered in the filter, still swimming like a brave little soldier. Would purchase again if price were $12, not $20."
3,Not The Best,"This is not the best game I`ve ever played. I think most people would like to lead a lap or two but you can`t!!! The computer speads up the field until they pass you. The handling is arcade style, waaay too easy. I have the very first NASCAR game and it is better than this one. I also think they need 43 drivers racing at the same time. People want realism and in real life there are 43 drivers racing, not 16!!! You are limited on just about everything, you don`t have good pitstop choices or anything. I think you could do better NASCAR!!!"
5,First class product,"An enjoyable buying experience. The price was excellent, arrived timely and in prime condition, and the arrows are perfect. Spine, fletching and finish are all excellent. I heartily recommend this seller."
4,"Great pad, but Start and Select should've been moved up.","Playstation's Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it, and they usually don't do a very good job. Their d-pads are always too awkward, or their construction is too lightweight. The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last. I'm an emulation gamer, and thanks to SmartJoy's USB adapter I can use a real PS1/PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem.My only gripes with the pad: A) The Start/Select buttons really should've been moved up after the addition of analog sticks. I'm always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select. B) While the d-pad is very sturdy, it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play. Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch-sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows."
5,Virtua Fighter!,As soon as I heard that there was an anime of one of my favorite game series I had to get this dvd. I watched online to see if it was good first and now I wish that more than 35 episodes more like 65-100. Virtua fighter fans if you like the game get the anime because it's very entertaining.
5,Great backpack,"I went to France last summer and was searching for something that would fit my needs: hold 3 cameras, maps, 20+ rolls of film, etc.Without a doubt this backpack made the trip a joy. I was able to carry a Nikon CP990, an SLR with an extra lens, a Lomo LC-A, all my filters, film, maps, a bottle of water, keys, passports, etc. It all fit it. And while the backpack may have felt heavy to lift, on my back it didn't cause any difficulty wearing it for extended periods of time.I love it, it feels great on my back and can carry more things than I need to.I now use it at home to carry all my stuff around. The rebuildable compartments are perfect. The greatest thing is that it just looks like a regular backpack."
4,A well-crafted bag that suits many needs,"Tamrac's Adventure 8 backpack is well suited for all sorts of day trips. The bag has a padded compartment for camera equipment, a main compartment suitable for holding a variety of goodies, and an assortment of smaller nooks and compartments for holding the rest of your gear.The Tamrac website boasts that the padded compartment has the capability to hold a camera body, 3 lenses of varying size, and a flash. While this is essentially true (assuming one of your lenses is attached to your camera body), squeezing that much gear would be a tight fit. I generallycarry a camera body, a table-top tripod, and either 2 extra lenses or a lens and the flash.The bag is small in size but large enough to handle a day's worth of gear and goodies. And because it looks like a backpack, the bag passes through certain security checks where traditional camera bags may be red flagged."
5,Yummy!,"I love marzipan, and the ""toasting"" gives it a unique flavor that is absolutely delicious. If you like marzipan, I truly believe you'll LOVE this product!!"
4,pretty good but not the best,"being raised in germany, i always had the great marzipan. when i got this box it actually did taste pretty good but it was somewhat dry, though i think the toasting is the cause of that. it didnt have an intense flavor and was more sweet than almondy, another reason it wasnt my favorite. i love marzipan but i cant afford the real expensive stuff so i buy this stuff and its delicious either way, since i rarely get to try it.shipping was on time and it was fresh. so all in all i rate this four, for the good service, and the good tasting candy.warning- it was smaller than i expected."
2,College Basketball fans stay away,"The game is to unrealistic. I play the pro basketball games and they are much better than this. First, there are only some mid-majors. The odds are if your team isn't a major school it wont be on there. Second, it is to unrealistic. You can be Howard and beat Duke by 20 even if it's your first time playing. You just go in for the steal and slam it and score. If you fail to steal you can just block it. If you try to drive the lane using back turns and crossovers the player just runs right out of bounds. They make it way to easy to shoot. If you play 20 minute halves you will find yourself with 70-80 points at halftime. On the other hand, the commentary is good and it is the only place with women's action. I would NOT recomend this game."
1,MARCH MADNESS 2000,"Who creates this game? Because let me tell you this game has not made any improvement over the last 4 years I think it's getting worse. First of all the back ground is horrible, you can't even read the stats.Second of all where are all the other conferences such as the sunbelt and so fourth. It is not callenging. I took the worst team to the final four the first time I played it. I think NCAA football creatures should get together, and use the same concept as they did when creating NCAA football. I will never buy this game again."
2,Cute but need a magnifying glass to see it,"Got this for my wife after she told me she had one as a child that she loved and it was destroyed. So I thought I'd surprise her and get her one.I was worried when it arrived in a mail bag not much bigger than a sandwich bag so I opened it and it's so small it looks like a chew toy for a small dog!When I think doll I think of something the size of a real baby that a child can cradle and rock in their arms but I can lay this doll flat on the palm of my hand and I'm not a big guy {ring size only 9). My wife says it looks just like the one she had as a child just a miniature version which was disappointing to her.It says 12 inch which sounds big but if you think about it 1 foot is just that, about the size of a medium adult shoe."
5,great game,"This was the best basketball ever when this came out plus it has legends like jordan, bird and Dr.J you can also play outdoors 1on1"
4,One of the best,What's up with all of you thinking that the graphics are bad. In my opinion there the best on any latest basketball game. I got this game 2-3 months ago and i cant stop playing it. I incoaurage everybody to go out and buy it.
5,The Best NBA Game Out There!,"This game has everything a real basketball fan would want. 1-1 streetcourt bball, all the great NBA players, all-star teams for the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80, and 90s! It also has great play-by-play commentary, and graphics. if you have Playstation, this is A MUST GET GAME."
4,One Slam Dunk of a Game,"NBA Live 2000 is just one of the many EA Sports games that just blows away all other games like it. This game has it all.The graphics are totally amazing in this game, and the sound is excellent. There are many different modes to play in, and each one offers you something different, making NBA Live 2000 one complete game.Being able to play with the legends is a really nice touch, and of course, the addition of Michael Jordan is huge. And, don't forget about all of the statistics. This is, by far, the best basketball game on the market. Not to steal any catch-phrases or anything, but NBA Live 2000 is FANtastic."
2,Different then any other Live game,"This game did not meet my expectations. The graphics downgraded. You CANNOT shot outside shots. And you cant drive to the hole. Everything got worse i dont understand how. I give it 2 stars because of the one-on-one mode, but that is all."
3,A little difficult to fold out...,"My 2-year-old son loves Maisy, so Santa got this book for him for Christmas. It is a nice book, but he needs help to look at it. The ""origami"" style fold out is difficult to use...I even have trouble with it sometimes!"
5,Awesome!,"This is a great backpack, durable and plenty of room for a whole days worth of books for classes and your laptop.The bone color is more of a off-white grey color, which i like.I love the pocket for my iPod and water bottle. It also has a nice zippered case for my computer doodads such as flash drives and other small items."
2,A Library Rental,"I have been reading books about vampires for years, starting as far back as Bram Stroker's ""Dracula"" and as current as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". They have all have one thing in common, they all tried to give the reader the illusion that vampires walk among us. Some stories worked while others failed. ""The London Vampire Pinic"" failed. What Romkey did was introduce familiar historical characters in his book to give us the illusion that a vampire could be anyone, including a great composer. It reminded me of a movie I watched years ago called ""Death Becomes Her"" with Bruce Willis. Just because the story wasn't interesting doesn't mean the book wasn't good. It had it's high points when it came to horror and suspense."
2,Too much for me..,"Submission and Suduction was alittle too hardcore for me...alot of butt plug this and butt plug that. Some of the ""love"" scenes were so outrageous to me that it read like a comedy. I enjoyed it overall, but It was just more oversexed than I would have liked."
4,Play on,Working well in the family's PS2. We have a lot of save games in it Good to know a PS1 memory card can work in a PS2. Play on!!!
5,Charge me up!!!,Some dude (a plumber) left his flashlight at my house....I called for nearly a year off and on and no one came to get it......soooo....I ordered this charger....It came quickly in the mail...was wrapped well .....and viola` it fit!!!...charged that flashlight right up....so now for the small price of this charger...I have a usable top of the line flashy...which in my neighborhood is muy importante...since the lights are always going off....(too many big trees near the power lines)...and at least the flashlight will always be super charged! Thanks
4,Good Utility Bag,"I bought this bag, and was shocked to see how small it was. However, I did find a pretty good way to use it. I store my spare batteries, Smart Media cards, lens cleaner, and other small items. This is kind of handy when on a short shoot outdoors, and don't want to lug around a huge camera bag. Buy it for this purpose, and it's a good deal. I don't reccomend this case for Digital cameras, or any camera for that matter. The case is unlined, and not padded. Only the very tiny Canon Elf would fit this bag ... I Think!"
2,talking pedometer,"We began to use the pedometer last week and the clip broke right away. Now we fill we have wasted our money, because it can't be clipped to my belt.It worked very well for a week. Loved it. Need a stronger clip so it can be used again."
3,Not bad could be better,My friends liked it but I was not too impressed as the quality was a bit distored. Seems as the copy they made it from is worn.
5,A World War II esponiage tale.......,"A World War II espionage tale that explodes with sheer drama in the face of allied adversity. The allies are are relying on your skill to triumph over the Nazis. Graphically, this game is a vivid pictorial of hand to hand combat. Audibly, if at all possible, play this game in surround sound, or you might just miss the bullets whizzing past your head, or the German attack dogs in the distance. This game contains replicas of authentic weapons used during the conflict that you'll be able to deploy with ease. Overall, this game is heart-pounding fun that will make you believe that you're behind enemy lines!"
5,a gotta have game for all you playstationers.,"this game is alot of fun, period. while the two player levels are small. they are still great fun. i think the only way they could be more fun is if it were 4 players. the 1 player game has alot to offer also. real missions and an environment that actually draws you into it. the graphics do get a bit blurry. but when it all comes down to it, this game is just plain fun."
5,THa best Psx shooter out there!,"THis game is challenging, but never frustrating levelz.. The game is divided into 7 missions, and after a while, the levelz get kind of old, but this game is still off tha hook! Great variety of weaponz to chooze from. go and buy this, you wont reGret it!"
5,you cannot put it down!,"All of Donachie's books are great! They are totally exiting and the main characters are rounded and charming. I always keep up all night to finish them. I have one criticism, however:What s really lacking is a map of a ship or a naval glossary because it is frustrating to have to skip over all the naval descriptions because you cannot understand them without background knowledge."
4,Where is that book?,"I am always looking for this book! Although I cannot fault the recipes, and there are truly some grand offers, the best part is the blue section in the back that explains what, when and how to best prepare this particular vegetable. When in a hurry, wondering if the microwave will destroy flavor, etc., this section gets opened on the table. It is already dog-eared and I have had it less than a year. Besides that - it is a pretty book! Great Gift for gardeners and a wonderful reference."
5,Insightful and Pragmatic Information,"I thought I'd be put off by this book - I have been by similar titles, and I can't stand pushy, egotistical parents - but this really impressed me with its insightful commentary and pragmatic tips. My favorite comments (p.50) were about monitoring high school grading, insights I've never read anywhere else. Admission officers complain that parents are ignorant of the quality of the applicant pool. Wissner-Gross's book will educate you about that pool and the fair and ethical efforts a parent can undertake to enhance their kids education, and eligibility. I appreciate her notes and links on this page and look forward to her next book."
3,history of angkor wat,"Good introduction to Cambodia's Angkor Wat. Leonard Nimoy, ""Mr. Spock's"" voice offers a nice touch too. I would recommmend this for those interested in traveling to this region in order to get a perspective on the culture and teasures awaiting visitors. I am anticipating a trip to Angkor Wat in the near future and think this presentation was a good start. I think the price was right for this VHS tape!!"
2,It doesn't really fit,"My Superwinch is mounted on my trailer and there is zero room underneath it to get this to fit. So I just did what I could to half-way secure it for the winter months to keep the Superwinch out of the snow. It's a really nice cover, but it doesn't fit correctly. The sides are not correct to make this fit. It looks like it was designed for some other type of winch."
4,Tamarac 5273 Fits The Bill,"I have an Olympus E-510 and an additional telephoto lens plus sun shades for both lenses and they all fit comfortably and securely in the back pack. There is also plenty of space for extra batteries, cards and personal items....I was even able to secure my tripod to the outside. If you have more gear than that opt for a larger product. Only negative for me is the zipper has a large overhanging flap (to keep things dry) and it is difficult to grasp the zipper at times. Suits me perfectly for photo outings."
1,Photo and description are very deceptive.,"There is no way the picture of the bag is the same one they send you. The bag will hold an SLR with a lens, an additional small zoom lens, a flash and a few small accessories. The pictures showing 3 - 4 other lenses and a teleconverter in addition to an SLR with a lens is completely misleading. This backpack should probably be called a backpurse. It is very small compared to ANY backpack you have ever seen. It will not hold what the pictures show. Amazon's description ""Capable of holding an SLR body with up to a 7-inch lens attached, as well as four to five additional lenses and equipment, the Expedition 3 is roomy enough to fit the needs of most photographers."" is simply not an honest statement. Remember the obscure Pentax 110 SLR? That little known interchangable lens SLR might fit per the description. This bag is the size of a medium sized shoebox."
3,Smaller than you think,"I have a rebel XT, 75-300, 50 1.8, and the 17-85 IS lenses. This bag claims this should all fit. I didn't mention that I have lens hoods for the 17-85 and the 75-300. I can fit the camera and lenses, but as soon as you add a flash (580EXII - Excellent flash), or the lens hoods, it goes from *unnngh-TIGHT* to *A pool of extra items sitting on the floor that wont fit*. Its a cute little backpack assuming you aren't serious (even halfway serious) about photography. If all you have is a kit lens and a 75-300, you might be OK, but any more, Go for something larger. Seriously."
2,It's a very nice bag - but way too small!,"This bag is well made, but the photo is VERY deceiving. My Olympus body is way too large for this bag, and so it will not even hold the body and two lenses. Don't get me wrong, the bag is nice - but for a point and shoot camera and a tube of lipstick - but not for a Pro!"
2,Way too small,I had no idea how small this was going to be. A normal human being would never be able to use the shoulder straps on this. It seems like it might be made for an infant. But why would an infant need this?
1,What was he thinking,"The Priestess is, as always, in charge and the Priest is relegated to being little more than an alter boy. The rituals presented are stiff and full of stilted language that, I suppose, is designed to make it sound as if it were old and important. In reading these rites I felt no spark of spontaneity or real emotion. One of the most disturbing ideas contained in the book is the idea that the priestess and priest of a coven are selected for their good looks and winning personalities. Which as a high priestess should be based on exp and fact""The most beautiful and most magnetic young woman shall act as the Priestess, and the most comely, dynamic young man shall act as the Priest."" is sexist as heck i brought this book back to store and demanded another look at (page 17) This is certainly not a book worth buying and one of problems in wicca and paganism I wonder why some wiccan go dianicED Fitch shame on you!! be balanced and do some more readingBalance is the keyBlessed Be;"
3,Druidism modified for feminists,I have to say I have read much on Druid lore and on the Wiccan religion. I have to say I get the impression that most of what is in the Wiccan religion is taken from the ancient Druids. Yet the Druids never required a woman to be the leader in spiritual matters. In fact the druids believed each were equal yet should be separated. I have to say that I feel this book as of most involving Wicca are mainly to make women feel better about them selves. Good in theory of magic and the training section is fantastic.
1,gardner rolling in his grave,"Grimoire of Shadows was one of the first books on the occult that I purchased, studied, and learned from. Looking over it again, I have no doubt as to why I stumbled so mcuh in the beginning. With books like these as the guideposts of initiation into the higher mysteries, the world would be filled with dabblers.I don't feel that Mr. Fitch gives any really good, solid information. He offers some exercises that won't really catapult the person anywhere, coupled with creating a desire for phenomenon, rather than real-world results. We all know that you can light a candle or burst a tumbler with your magickal abilities, but why waste your time? This sums up most of the book and its exercises: a waste of time."
1,Two steps back for the Wiccan community...,"As with most Wiccan books, Fitch's writing contains informative pieces on Wicca's rituals, spells, and especially magickal training. However, some of this author's attitudes (mostly in the beginning sections of his work) that merge with his beliefs are archaic and disturbing, and discredits much of Wiccan philosophy. I would recommend it only for its magickal training, and I warn anyone to disregard Part 1 - and subsequent bits of other sections - of this book, if they chose to read it at all."
3,"A great story, but....","The Buddy Rich story had to be told, and on the whole Torm√© does it with honesty and humour. His writing, however, suffers from a number of bad mixed metaphors, and there is a dreadful editing mistake when the lead in quote to one of the final chapters is dated as being at Rich's birthday party in 1988. He died in 1987. These qualms aside, the book is easy reading, with many funny anecdotes. The view of the jazz scene is predictably white and cronyish, but the main interest is Rich's extraordinary life and talent."
2,Not as GOOD as I remembered...,First off the music is not relative to the times the movie is trying to depict. Two the characters as with most of Bakshi's work are nothing more than archetypes. They don't stretch out beyond their own limitations which is frustrating. And just quite frankly the story just stinks. Truly one of his lesser works. If you want to see a real Bakshi masterpiece take a gander at American Pop. Now that's a movie.
5,Bakshi's best!,i love this show. ill be so glad when it comes to dvd.you got to see this. its so funny!ill buy the dvd of this in a sec.
5,Tight Fit for Sony DSC-S85/S75,"I purchased this bag based on an earlier review that the S85 fits. Well, it does, but it's a REAL snug fit...Plus, I plan to add a filter adaptor and filter to protect the Carl Zeiss lens. Then, it DEFINITELY won't fit.This bag is actually 3/4"" thinner (I.D.) than the next smaller model, the 5693 (not stocked by Amazon).But it's a NICE bag. Just doesn't fit my application."
2,Buy Items Seperate,"Just a note of interset: I have always had good luck with my Senco tool and have no reason to expect different from this compressor or nail gun. What really surprised me was that the gun did not come with a case. The case makes it easier to transport the tool to a job site and helps protect the tool when not in use so it last longer. I suppose the description does not indicate it has a case so I should have known better, but I thought that since about 15 years ago when Senco dropped (was forced to change) the policy of selling their cases seperately they would not be so cheap as to not include the two-dollars-worth of plasic with this brad nailer. What really surprised me was that now that I checked I can buy both items seperately form Amazon for four dollars less than the l kit price, both with free shipping and get the case for the brad nailer. Not a big deal; but, get more and spend less - Amazon normally does better than this. Buy them seperate."
3,Lightweight,"Drives 2 1/2"" nails in well but needs a fair amount of recovery time if you are driving more than a few nails at a time. Much quieter than a gas gun. It's a light weight compressor for light weight work."
1,don't buy it!,"Thought this compressor would be the answer for smaller jobs. I bought the compressor only as I own senco guns already. It lasted only three small jobs, maybe 300 fasteners shot with this compressor and it stopped working. It's past the 90 days warrenty-I missed that, thought 1 year. don't buy this one. what a dissapointment!"
5,Easy To Learn - Impossible To Put Down,"Totally addictive gameboy version of the well-known card game. Cute animation, clever graphics, nicely-done sound effects. The music is really annoying, but easily turned off. Excellent value for the money."
5,Awesome Bluegrass collection,"I bought this CD because I am a huge Tony Rice fan. When it comes to bluegrass accoustic guitar picking, Tony Rice is in a class by himself.This CD is certainly one of the best for Tony Rice and bluegrass fans. Wish that I could rate it higher that just 5 stars!"
5,Great Quality for the price!,"Wasn't sure what to expect because of the price, but they are heavy duty rubber mats, the smell is not bad at all! If people complain about the smell they are anal and don't deserve them. They fit in my Subaru Impreza\outback perfectly except one part by the driver side, but the best part is they have cut outs to fit your car.. so after i cut that section out they were perfect. A girl at my job saw them and ordered them. I highly recommend."
1,nauseous and a headache,"I don't know what these mats are made of but they should not be allowed to be used in a closed space such as a car. The have a horrible smell. They smell like burned rubber. After a week of driving around with the windows rolled down hoping that whatever they are off-gassing goes away, I have resorted to scrubbing them with soap and a stiff brush. Even after a vigorous scrub, they still smell. I will either return them to amazon or throw them away. I just hope that what ever they are off-gassing it not a carcinogen.WARNING: The smell of these mats may make you nauseous and will likely cause a headache."
4,Rubber Queen 70501 4 piece Vinyl Floor Mats,"I purchased these Mats for my car from Amazon back in June. They have worked out very well. There is nothing worse than having mats that are constantly moving & buckleing up under your feet! These stay in place & don't move easily. Once in awhile, I have to reposition the one on the drivers side but not often. Also, when it gets cold, some mats become very stiff, bend & freeze so that you can't flaten them-frustrating to say the least! These mats get cold but don't bend or freeze they stay flat. They are also easy to clean--wet them-little soap & water-hose them off-good as new! I've used these mats now for 7 months and there is no sign of wear & tear to this date. They are very durable. The price was right too! I am very pleased with these mats."
3,Very Interesting.,"I love this album. I would give it a higher rating but I honestly do not believe everyone who gives it a try will like it. My recommendation is to listen to the first song. If you like the first song you will love the album. If you don't like it than it probably isn't for you. The music is very dark, but very interesting. Matthew and Karla Schickle create some of the eeriest vocal harmonics belting out very powerful lyrics about the lack of care and responsibility we see in modern society. I wish I could elaborate on the content of this cd but it truly is hard to describe. Just remember to have an open mind when you decide to give it a go."
5,Jean De Florette/ Manon of the Spring,"This double feature details village life in Provence, where greed breeds tragedy, and a terrible truth comes out...too late. It is a well-told soap opera in some respects, but it features many of France's better actors in roles they play brilliantly. The cinematography is super, and the scenery a delight. I recommend these two highly. They are films you will want to watch more than once!"
2,"Too small for an SLR, and just too small","I returned this item because it was just not big enough for my SLR. I have two lenses, neither is huge. I tried to fit the camera with one lens on and another off, plus flash and a few other gizmos. Everything was too tight. There were several pockets inside the flap allegedly for accessories (they mentioned filters), but my filters, my notebook, my lens tissue -- none fit! They make some dubous claim about strapping on a tripod, but they don't mean a professional tripod, I guess.I'll try the larger model and see if things are better."
3,My parents had a fit!,"I read this book in junior high (82-84). I got it from the library at school. My mom found it and read it and both my parents freaked out! They made a visit to the librarian (who hadn't read the book) and it ended up getting pulled from the shelves! I know I won't let my daughter (now 10) read this book until she's old enough to date, but we will have many conversations about the subject matter before that happens. I would absolutely warn parents to read it first and then decide if it's appropriate for your daughter. It has a good message about adoption, but you may be turned off by the other subjects addressed.PS - haven't read it since junior high, but I still remember it!"
3,Could be more realistic,"While the overall content of teen sex and pregnancy was realistic, I had to laugh at poor Julie's hospital experiences. I was hoping with the newest addition, it might be more believable. Having worked in a hosptial OB unit since 1989, I have yet to give a laboring mom an enema, nor do we use cold sterile delivery rooms.( I could see where this might have been believable in the early eighties edition of the book, but it should have been deleted in the 1995 edition and most definitely the most recent one). I think the author could have kept in mind that most people (especially teens) have watched one of the many true birth stories on TV and could be given better info than the delivery in the book. If it was made to scare teens into abstinance, it would be better to have it more believable than to try to scare them with a humiliating hospital experience. Most OB's are women these days, and almost everyone gets an epidural well before they are too uncomfortable!"
5,The truth,"Defines the truth about our relationship with Israel. A whole nation on America's welfare rolls. It is very obvious, that American Middle East policy is formulated and directed from Tel Aviv, where a ruthless ruler, wanted by the World Court for crimes against humanity, is challenged by a Nobel Peace Prize winner. You would never know that by reading the daily distortions, served by the American media. Magnificent book, equalled only by Liberty, ..."
3,It's too small for the Olympus c-2100,"This is a lovely, well made case which would be fine for a small digital camera, but it's too small for the c-2100. The camera goes into the case very snugly which makes it difficult to remove later. There is very little room for accessories. I'll probably use it for my old Kodak dc210 and look for a new case for the Olympus."
5,Perfect for the C 2100UZ,"I bought this case for the Olympus c2100 UZ and it fits perfectly. The front pocket holds two sets of spare batteries, the inside pocket spare camedia cards and the outside pocket the remote and a Zio. The camera goes in back downwards and there's additional room by the side of the lens if you need it. It has a nice long shoulder strap too. Good buy."
3,"OK, I think",I don't have enough experience with this kind of product. I want to carry the manual with the camera (I'm a rookie) but dosn't fit easy.
5,Tamrac 5696 with Canon S1 IS,"I picked up the lens adapter for the Canon S1 which increased the dimensions of the camera. This Tamrac case is the perfect match for it and I am able to carry 3 extra memory cards, an extra set of 4 AA batteries as well as a cleaning pen and an audio/video cable.The top down storage of the camera also makes for fast removal/storage.Excellent design and quality."
5,What a Goddess!,"I've gotta admit, I'm a huge Beyonce fan. This single, though it only contains 2 tracks, is worth adding to any collection. The tracks are:1. Me, Myself, & I (radio edit)2. Krazy in Luv (Junior's Dance radio mix)As an added bonus, the cover art is beautiful as well. 'Me, Myself, & I' is one of the 9 slow jams featured on Beyonce's solo debut ""Dangerously in Love."" 9 ballads is a little heavy, indeed, but at least all of them are very stylish and beautifully sung. And honestly, a slow jam is a perfect choice for the upcoming holiday season. Ballads tend to do best on radio during this time of year. Let's hope that Beyonce's next single in the new year will be the Middle Eastern flavored 'Naughty Girl.' Cheers to Beyonce on a job beatifully done!"
2,business math,"This book is alright. It is outdated though, the book still uses examples from the 90's. Like Profit functions dealing with the sales of VCR's!"
1,HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE OF A BOOK!,"Pray that you have a good instructor. The only thing I dislike about my instructor is that she picked this book to use!!!!! If you have a good College Algebra book, I suggest you use it for clearer examples. That's the only thing getting me through at the moment. This book as good as sold (to the next sucker) when this class is over!"
3,Its ok for a cheap shooter,"I bought this game because of the N64 game golden eye, this was NOTHING like that. You are in 3rd person mode, and its hard to maneuver almost all of the time. Also, having automatic weapons is no help, the enimy takes its damage and wont take another for about another second or 2, destroying the purpose of having and automatic weapon. The graphics aren't very good either. There is however no bloodshed, making it more suitable for younger people. This is ok, just not like I expected it to be."
1,"Very, very bad game","Tomorrow Never Dies is one of the worst action games ever. There are hardly any puzzles to solve, and the puzzles in the game are extremely easy. There was no thought put into this game. Only 10 levels that are SOOO short. There are only about 3-4 hours of gameplay. Weapons were okay, but they were too powerful, and that kind of made the game too easy. I mean, the pistol has UNLIMITED ammo. It also has sixteen bullets per clip, and an extremely fast rate of fire. The pistol can kill regular enemies so easily, and it can even kill the bosses easily. I could beat the whole frikkin' game using the pistol. Also, Bond never dies. The enemies are so dumb that you will never lose. When I play games, I want a challenge..."
3,Very Spotty but Heck Its Bond,"If this game did not have the Bond name and at least the cool movie clips in it from the movie it would easily get two stars, but that makes it worth three. So what's wrong with this game? First of all the controls are not intuitive at all. And after spending awhile resetting the controls to something I could use I found the interaction awful. I don't know how many times I died trying to walk down stairs and getting caught. Also the aim is terrible. It seems like no matter how well I aim I'm always off, finally I figured out that it seems to fire just above the actual aiming dot. The level designs are okay, but nothing spectacular and the graphics are decent but again nothing spectacular. Overall my biggest problem with this game is that it has a high frustration factor. You seem to spend more time dying from something accidental than doing what you were trying to do. Heck though it is Bond."
2,Tomorrow never dies review,TND is a boring action adventure game that tries to match Syphon Filter but doesnt come close.
1,This game is horrible,"This game is horrible. The graphics are terrible, the control is absolutly a joke. When I was playing the game it was so hard to shoot the terrorists because the control is off. Another thing is Bond has no auto aim in the game. This makes it very difficult to shoot people. EA released this game without even completing the game. I advise everyone who reads this to not buy this game. This game isn't even worth the price on this website. Its worth a lot less. If you don't belive me just rent the game and you will see for yourself."
2,"Sorry Robert, It's Just Not That Good","I was really looking forward to another Cure album after the beautiful ""Bloodflowers"". This was a major disappointment for me though. The Cure is my favorite all-time band, I own EVERYTHING from them...but this I listen to very rarely. Even ""Wild Mood Swings"" is better than this. There are some very good moments, like ""The Promise"", ""Anniversary"", and ""Labyrinth"", but that's about it. The production is horrible. Korn is another of my favorite bands, but their producer did NOTHING to help the sound of the Cure. I listen to three songs on here and that's about it. I loved Bloodflowers, but not this. It's just not that good. And I agree about the DVD. I watched it once and that's it. Definitely not worth an extra dollar, let alone 3-4. Wild Mood Swings was the last album from the Cure that made me skip songs...until this chaotic mess. Next please..."
2,Coulda have been much better,"Ill tell you how I think this album could have been much better..1) Get a new producer. There is some great potential here in these somgs. Increase the volume and clarity of the bass, drums, guitars, and keyboards. They are so distant to roberts vocals. I played this for several people and they where like ""where is the music at?""2) Stop screaming and moaning on every song. Its not needed and lose the repetative lyrics.3) Include all the tracks on the album. Ive heard the additional tracks and they are better then most of the ones on the american release. Its a slap in the face to your american audience to leave off some good songs."
3,I'M A TRUE CURE FAN AND NOBODY CARES,"Let's all cry right now for all the ""TRUE"" cure fans who are enraged by negative reviews of this album. Lighten up. My God, Robert did. He's happy now, people. And sad. And lost. And in love. And in pain. But for some reason, I'm not connecting to this batch of songs. I crave the feeling I got when I first heard ""The Edge of the Deep Green Sea"" or ""Fascination Street"". To me, this album comes across as outtakes of Wild Mood Swings and Bloodflowers. ""The End of the World"" tends to be beautiful when driving at night. And ""Anniversary"" is swell. But, I crave the orchestral sounds of Wish and Disintegration. I miss the rich layers, the neverending build-ups, and the harmonies. Sure, this cd isn't awful, but how I wish it were better."
2,Adding a bad taste 2 what should've been a nice occasion.,"Ok, The Cure made a really good album. Now here is the problem. The f*ckfaces only released 3/4 of it in America. Why does Japan get three extra songs? Why does England get one extra song? And really, why does the crappy vinyl version HAVE FOUR EXTRA SONGS? I know 20 songs were recorded, so use some ""non-album"" material for a b-side. I don't want to buy any more singles. You have made enough money off of me. You want a higher rating? Put up the songs you ripped me off for to download for free on your website (I will download them anyway). Don't try to pull that greedy @ss crap again."
2,Catchyness?... close to none,"I wanted to give it 3 stars. I dont think its good enough. The album lacks melodies, and strains on repetitive lyrics and unchanging music backing up Roberts vocals. While a song may start out quite intresting, dont expect anymore surprises after the first minute, there are none. Songs tend to drone on with the same repetitive sounds( ex. Lost, Labyrinth). The Cure have excellent albums, and plenty of great songs... this album however contributes to non of that.Being so its also cut short of 3 tracks found on the import... I wouldnt even buy it knowing im getting ripped off for 3 other songs. Why not include them all. Pointless. And having those tracks could greatly change my opinion givin theres a little bit more there to listen to. This album just dosent hold up to anyhting in the past they have done. and again, were cut short with only 11 tracks when they recorded close to 20 for this album. Dissapointing, so hopefully better luck next time."
3,Simple and Safe,"Correct me if I am wrong, but is this the third album in a row in which Robert has a ""Swan Song""? Anyway..he should keep going on, and on, and on. The music in the album is superb. Lyrics...well, quite simple and basic; but yet they say so much. A definte keeper...but i am looking forward to his solo ""stuff"" in which he has already recorded...he is simply toying with our emotions...like every song."
3,If this music wasn't written by R. Smith: FIVE STARS,"The two songs you're looking for are: ""End of the World"" and ""alt.end"". The first is written in the more calculated and well-orchestrated 80's Cure style, the second is more stream of consciousness but equally intriguing. A lot of this album is filler. I am a big fan of Robert Smith, enough to buy the Cure VHS this week (all of the older videos and some wanky filler footage). If you aren't familiar with their sound, but would like to hear what they're all about, try: ""Disintegration"" or ""Wish"". The bonus DVD was of no interest to me, except for the Smith stills frizzes his hair and wears lipstick."
5,hammer drill,"I have been using Milwaukee drills for years and they have all been great. This hammer drill is no exception. I have never used a hammer drill before now, only a rotary hammer, but this drill performed as needed. It took a little more pressure while drilling, but it did the job."
5,buy it now!,"this disc serves as a reminder of what a real band doing real music is all about. this rocks, plain and simple!"
3,okay low budget horror film,I have a five dollar copy of this movie and I don't think it's that bad. I really enjoyed Tom Savini's performance.At least it's better than The Ripper.
3,Equivalent to a 100 watt light bulb,I had to buy the 150 watts bulb in order to get enough light for my dinning room light fixture where a conventional 100 watt bulb was used.
2,Kirk Alyn,"Kirk Alyn as a reporter who saves the beautiful Adrian Booth in chapter after chapter. Kirk was a Republic stuntman who finally got credit in his own serial. He shows little of the foot action that he was noted for as a stuntman. He is most noted for the later Superman serials. Roy Barcroft is the #1 bad guy, but even he is not up to his usual excellent job. Several of the cliffhangers are from other Republic serials. Adrian Booth is a beautiful woman. For Kirk Alyn and Roy Barcroft fans. Little else good about it. I give it 2 stars."
2,FIFA 2000,"VERY disappointing! I bought this game because I have loved playing the FIFA series. After several matches of 9-5, I think I may sell it or wait till the next FIFA game for the PS2. It is NOT realistic for the fact that SO MANY goals are scored. Julie Foudy is TERRIBLE! She sounds like a kindergartener. Nuf Said."
4,good product,"Pros: works as advertised specially in warm climateCons: quite a bit messy, if you use it under gym clothes you must wash them by themselves, i learned it the hard way when i put all my work out clothes with the ones i use to do my cardio with sweet sweat and the other clothes got stained with the wax residue, it took me a wash with hot water to get it out, which is not too good for delicate fibers like in under armor or other high end training clothing.Overall i would recomend this product"
4,Helped me out,Rich smooth application smells great. Get the most out of your workout with this product.. Will buy again have had two of the girls in the 98degree hot yoga class try it out and they were impressed
5,Fastest and safest way to cut weight for a fight!!!,"This is the best sweat enhancer on the market! I had no idea that you can lose so much water weight in a single workout and/or sauna session. I am a MMA fighter and I typically cut around 6-8 lbs. per fight. It used to take me 2-3 hours to cut this much water weight and I would usually have no energy for my fights the next day because I was so depleted from sitting in the sauna for so long. I have seen several guys around the gym using Sweet Sweat so and raving about it. So I finally decided to try it for my next fight. WOW!!! I could not believe how much I was sweating with Sweet Sweat. I could honestly fill up a glass with all of the sweat in my shirt and shorts. I was able to cut 8 lbs. of water weight for my next fight in just one hour of exercising and sauna. I also had more energy the next day for my fight which gave me the edge I needed to fight through a decision. From now on, Sweet Sweat will always be in my gym bag!!"
5,terrific,"These restored films are a real pleasure to watch. Both sound and picture are excellent. The only mar is the sometimes inaccurate close-captioning; otherwise, a fine product."
4,Sherlock Holmes Collection Vol. 1,I enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes DVDs. The quality is much better than watching the movies on the classics channel. I enjoy the subtle digs at Watson and Rathbone plays a excellent arrogant Holmes. I think Sherlock Holmes fans will watch this collection over and over again.
2,Inconvenient,"The bookends are big and clunky - not good for small shelves as they'll take up all the shelf space and leave no room for books. When I opened the box one of the book ends had 3 of the 4 tabs broken off - the ones that keep the picture in. When opening the back of the other bookend to put a photo in another tab broke off. Also, the picture area has rounded corners. You will need to trim any 4x6 photo you intend on putting into the bookends."
5,aqua4-hawaii,"I really do like this product. I started using it from a sample I received in the mail when I was pregnant. I squeezed every bit I could out of this little tube. I first used it when my son was 3 or 4 weeks old when he started having that shinny red, dry cheeks and rash around his mouth. Applied thick and gently dabbed it off. Overnight I could see the difference in his face. I also use this for my 7 year old who has eczema. Great for any dry skin. I highly recommend this product."
5,very simple and good for small children,"I had expected that the game would entail lots of racing over many surfaces but it was just a hot wheels car on a hot wheels track. The track is set up in several different places around a home. My son is five years old and really enjoys this game. It is the type of game where you can just ""floor it"" and keep going. If you want to do really well it takes additional skill to spin, brake, flip or swerve the car for extra points. But my son just likes racing the car as fast as it can go. He rarely notices what place he came in. This is not like the video arcade game ""Cruisin' USA"" where he cannot stay on the track for more than a few seconds at a time. (not that he tries very hard not to hit the trees, etc.)"
3,"Like it overall, BUT...","My son is 4 and loves this show on T.V. While looking for DVD's on-line, this particular one caught my attention. ""A Whale of a Tale"" and the pictured Orca on the front gave the impression that there was an episode or more with an Orca character. My son if very ocean friendly and is loves learning about it's many animals...of which the Orca is his favorite. We got the DVD, put it in the player and watched all the episodes with no Orcas seen. As much as he loved watching Olly and his adventures, he was for sure bummed out that there was no episode with the Orca as pictured and, for the most part, stated on the front. A lttle touch of false advertising! Bummer!"
5,Camera Case (used for G120,"After reading many, many reviews, we decided to buy this camera case. This fits our Canon G12 perfectly. The camera has the shoulder strap attached, and still fits fine. We also have a backup battery/memory card stored in front. I would recommend this camera case for any G12 owner."
5,a peak experience!,"It is clear by this live document that the Waterboys were a band more than just a solo instrument for Mike Scott's muse. The interplay between musicians is astounding and the energy clearly shines through. The version of ""Purple Rain"" is incendiary and proves that this band was willing to take risks. A must have for fans of this band and a great starting place for the uninitiated."
2,THEY GAVE ME THE BLUES,"I anticipated buying this release on Amazon , especially after reading 5 star reviewa. I was disaappointed .Two songs , i think they are titled Death Is Not the End , and This is the Sea , are great , but much of the album ,and it is a double C D , ( and especially the fiddle , ) sounds the same , with virtually none of the sounds I love on a live alvum , to wit the crowd."
2,Just OK,"I've been using this product for about a month now. I don't see any difference between this product and any of the others I've tried for dried, cracked skin. The search continues..."
2,Education should be kept secular,"As the others, I had to buy this book for a semester at college.I haven't gone in too far, and so far the explanations and theories all seem good, but I have one problem: bringing in Christian beliefs to topics.I don't need to read that the ""original sin"" brought about scarcity or how Genesis is a ""powerful account"" of how natural resources came to be. That is absolutely ridiculous, whether or not you are a Christian, that is YOUR belief and should not be forced upon others. All I need to know is that scarcity exists and that natural resources are limited, I can study and become an economist without having to swallow beliefs that I do not share.How would you feel if your textbook said the Indian god Krishna caused scarcity? Or how Allah created all resources or how Buddha affects your choices?Revise the book and get rid of the religious aspects."
3,"This is okay, but it is no hospital pump!","I stayed in the hospital for 1 week & 1day after my son was born. During this time, I used the electric pump from the hospital. They were able to get this pump for me for free. My insurance paid for it. It does not have the same suction power as the hospital pumps. It is convenient that all the equipment fits in this backpack. It seems to be an okay pump, but I wish they made it as powerful as the hospital pumps. I also wish they sold replacement parts. One of my tubes is splitting where it connects to the bottles. This affects the suction power, so it needs to be replaced."
5,Happy in Texas,"I am a first time Mom and have used the Medela Traveler for almost one year. I bought the pump when my son was about a week old so that I could continue to breastfeed after I went back to work. I have never had any issues with the pump, although the plastic tubes are now a bit loose and sometimes disconnect during the expressing process.Buying the Traveler version was the best pump for us as it is easy to travel with and the battery pack is also very convenient to use while in the car.I would highly recommend this pump for anybody that is considering breastfeeding. If not for this pump, I doubt I would have breastfed for more than a couple of weeks as I could not determine the quantity of milk that my son was receiving."
1,this is the worst wrestling game ever,Don not buy wcw maythem.It is not even close to attidues power.This Game is not a stocking stuffer.
2,WCW Boredom (Mayhem),"Mayhem may be the worst wrestling game ever made. The graphics are good enough, although everyone looks disperportional, and the sound is good, although rather baren. What drags this game down is the gameplay. Quite simply, there is none. The one button moves and complete lack of strategy or challenge makes for a very boring game. The wrestlers move very well, there's just no fun in playing. The create your own wrestler should have been left out as it's very limited. Tho only redeeming quality of this game is the running commentary of Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone. Bottom line, it's not worth it."
3,FFVI is a MUST to have. FFV and the music CD are JUNKS!,"FFVI is undoubtedly the best in the FF series. It has the best storyline and playability. But if you started your FF experience with FF7 or above, U may found the ""old"" game less than attractive. But the storyline is still the best so far. The music CD is a total crap! It doesn't even include the Celes theme. What's in the mind of those people who edited the music CD! FFV... let's put it this way, if U have better game choices, just put this game on the display shelf."
4,Don't claim to be a FF fan if you have not experienced this!,"Final Fantasy Anthology is truly a blessing to the new generation of FF fans. If you started out with the PS FFs, then you probably did not play the older ones. This compilation combines FFV and, most importantly, FFVI. FFV introduces the fantastic job system, but it is a very average game. The only reason you simply must buy this is FFVI. Considered as the best game in the series by many fans, this game is simply amazing. Although lacking in graphics by today's standard, almost every other aspect of this game beats the best of today's games! Be it the characters, story or music, FFVI is truly a masterpiece. I gave this a four-star rating only because the graphics don't match today's standards."
5,Squaresoft+RPG=Gaming heaven,"It usually takes a year or two for Square to release another Final Fantasy game, but anthology is not just one great FF game, it's two great FF games. Sure they're old and many will be scared off by the 16-bit graphics, but those who stick around will enjoy some quality gaming. This package will last you a while too, as each game will take 40+ hours to complete. This is well worth your time."
4,Good but could be better,"I am glad they decided to remake this for the playstation - It gave me a chance to replay a classic. But they decided to upgrade some parts of the game and in doing so they made it worse in my opinion. The battle scenes have been modified with new intro and exit graphics which would be a good idea but it adds more time to the game that doesn't need to be there. Also the modified item names did not need to be done - like changing FenixDown to PhoenixDown. It is a good idea, but doing so changes the fun of the original game.Overall I like it but I think they should have left the original alone."
3,big disappointment,"I bought this to play FFVI, so I never played FF V. This remake just sucked....for one thing, the sound effects were screwed up, as well as some slowdown. Another gripe is no extras except a couple cutscenes and a monster encyclopedia. I guess I was expecting more cutscenes and a lot of other extrasskip this and just get an emulator and play the original SNES version"
5,Totally worth it,"Now obviously Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI were originally on the SNES (and V wasn't originally released in the U.S.), so the graphics aren't going to be like they are today. However, the newly added CG Movie Sequences that were put into the game as an opening sequence are stunning, and the graphics for VI were PS1 quality at some parts.Anyway, both games have a very captivating storyline, and you genuinely get to know the characters. The gameplay is also different in both games with regards to learning new abilities and such, so it's not like you're having to start from square one again once you finish one game, and then start the other. These two games have all the Final Fantasy trademarks like the same opening score, Chocobos, Moogles, a character named Cid, an airship, etc. If you're a Final Fantasy fanatic...this game is a must."
4,A Good Investment,"Two great RPG's in one package. Playstation owners who began Final Fantasy with the 7th installment can finally see what all the hype is about with VI. Final Fantasy V is also a great game, the first in the series where you spend alot of time in the menu combining abilities with accessories/equipment to customize your characters.The only downside is the short load times when entering battles/opening the menu/entering new levels. However, these never last more than a few seconds.Whether you're discovering the SNES generation of Final Fantasy for the first time or re-visiting the classics, Final Fantasy Anthology offers a great gaming experience that you can only get on a console."
5,Its an ok game,I liked this game. I mean Final Fantasy VII is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok.
5,Oh sweet victory!,"I am now ready to die!This game make me realize how mundane my life is. What a self reflection!You can take me now, oh non-existant god."
4,The true classics are never outdated,"FFV and FFVI are probably the two very best old RPGs, and that's why they're still around now. These two games definitely live up to the Final Fantasy standard with good stories, likable characters, and good battle systems. Longtime FF fans will surely want to pick this one up, but people whose first Final Fantsy was FFVII or FFVIII might not be able to handle the oudated graphics. These people will want to rent it first to see if they can take it. If the old feel doesn't bug you too much, FF Anthology is a great choice."
5,A delicious and wonderful treat!,"While the notion that you can cut them into 12 tiny 100 calorie servings is a bit silly..these brownies are wonderful, fat free heaven. I am willing to mail order these beauties just to have the nonfat treat. Try them hot with frozen cool whip on top and send your diet into taste overdrive!!"
4,"Low price, good book","The book condition is still good although its bought used. There are a few writings on the pages but its fine. However, there are some missing pages probably from printing error of the book."
1,scary book,"I purchased this book after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, both my 14 month old granddaughter and my 17 month old grandson, were so frightened by the loud ""moo"" and the blinking lights at the end of it, that they both burst into tears and had to be comforted. My granddaughter even became frightened at the mere sight of the book...without even opening it!! And they weren't together when they saw the book...my granddaughter was visiting first, and then a couple of days later my grandson...so they clearly weren't influenced by each other's reactions.I have now had to hide the book so that they can't come across it!!Never again will I purchase these books!! I'd be interested to know if any other parents or grandparents had this experience."
5,Millie Moo Touch and Feel Picture Book,I love this book. It is fun reading it to my grandchildren and they love to interact with me while I am reading it to them. I have eight children and 7 of them are married. I have bought this book for each family to have. I highly recomend it.
4,Rubber rings for Blender,"The rings are fine..Nothing wrong with gaskets.There were supposed to be 3 rings in the pack and instead there wereonly 2 rubber gaskets. Poor quality control regarding packing. I notified company, and they never sent the 3rd ring!These are not expensive items...but if ad states 3 rings, then I expect 3 rings, not 2!!"
4,Blender Gaskets,"I keep chewing up my blender gaskets. Could not find in any stores, but went online and there they were. Ordered and was shipped the next day. I know have spares and no longer worry about doing my blending. Great response time. Thanks"
5,"yup, they're rubber rings alright","well when i couldn't find my oster blender gasket,aka rubber ring,for like a month.i decided to make sure that never happened again.hence this purchase.now i have a back up in case one falls into the compost hole in our kitchen(not shortly after my rings arrived did i find the original in the compost) or gets eaten by the blender(which has happened).it's good to know i have a spare or three."
2,Confusion: Beecham vs. Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra,"I think I stumbled upon the explanation for the confusion exhibited here in the reviews by Unrath and Snyder. It appears that Amazon has mixed the reviews for Thomas Beecham's version of Symphonie Fantastique with those of Andreas Sporri and the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra. The latter can be found on Emusic at:[...]The album graphics and track timings are virtually identical with this one, and it is a much more modern sounding but lame plodding tepid performance. So if you download this one, you're probably getting Sporri's version. Too bad.The real Beecham, labeled as such, is at:http://www.amazon.com/Berlioz-Symphonie-Fantastique-Corsaire-Troyens/dp/B000TDBL1K/ref=sr_1_sc_1_digr?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1356399966&sr;=1-1-spell"

5,Like having a teacher right with you,"I loved this book. I have bought other sushi books that SAY they can teach you sushi, but end up just being picture books of one style. This book has all of the favourites from the restaurants and an outstanding set of directions for how to CUT the sashimi! This is the only book you will ever need."
4,Not that great,When I bought this I thought it was going to be something easier than Dance Dance Revolution because I find DDR pretty hard. So when I started playing this I kept winning and winning because it was to easy! Hmm.....Maybe I'll get better at DDR and just stick with that.
3,Beware of alcohol content,"I am not too sure as to what the effects of alcohol are or are not when it comes to this product, but we only bought it because are usual provider was experiencing inventory issues. Apawthecary has a strong alcohol smell which made me question just how much of the actual milk thistle was in the bottle.As for the benefits of Milk Thistle itself, this product has been one of the key contributors to our dog-with-cushings success. We also give it to other dogs in hope of preventing cushings as well as other problems."
2,Not for squash,"If you use it for squash, you need two racquet compartments 'cause the strings break more often than in tennis, so you usually carry two racquets just in case. It has only one racquet compartment. Anyway you can put in two racquets, but there is less room for other things. Another important issue is to carry your squash shoes. There is not enough room for this unless you force the whole backpack.The second compartment is big. You can put another t-shirt, wrist bands, cell phone, but forget to put it in order, because the inside pockets are to tight to put anything there. The zipper in this compartment is annoying."
3,The Arabian Show Horse,"First, The Arabian Show Horse is not a guide on showing your Arabian. It might be more aptly titled Skippers Complaint. The Book is a critique on the development of Arabian horse breeding in context with what the author believes is breeding for show type and ignoring the classic Arabian characteristics. For the American reader, unless you are really up on British breeding programs the horses won't ring many bells as far individual horse recognition.Amid the criticisms there is plenty of historical and interesting information. Many beautiful pictures. I guess overall I could have done without the authors biases while complaining about those of other breeders."
2,disappointing,"Although this track is fun to drive the cars around by hand, one of the points of the toy is to shoot your car up a ramp. The launcher barely has enough power to get the car (even the car provided with the toy) TO the ramp, let alone up it with any sort of force."
2,Please get a better editor!,"As others have mentioned, the book was really poorly written. I actually have a hard-copy of the book (free, thankfully!) and I finally got out my red pen because I couldn't stand it any more. There was incorrect word usage and poor grammar. They even used the wrong name for a character at one point!(they must have changed it at some point at missed some corrections) Most of that I blame on whoever the editor was supposed to be. Even moving past all of that, I found the plot tremenously predictable and trite, with excessive meanlingless details. Since this was a Harlequin, some of me also expected a little more on the ""romance"" side of things, even though it is supposed to be an ""intrigue"" novel. Yeah, none of that either. Can't believe someone got paid to write this..."
3,Family ranch saga,"When bones are discovered in a old well on the Cardwell ranch, it uncovers more then just a murder. Lies, betrayals and fund-raisers, along with murders and threats. This book as done wonders for the simple art of romance writing. Our main characters have to deal with family, past wrongs and lies, to uncover the truth about what happened at the well all those years ago.Well written and thought out plot. You wont know who it was until the end. Well worth the read."
4,"Actually, it was good.","Never suspected who the killer was! Threw me for a loop. Mystery, murder, romance its got it all. I'm impressed with this Harlequin book. They usually don't do it for me"
2,Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch (Harlequin Intrigue),"i returned this book after reading just a few chapters. It really didn't appeal to me at all, perhaps it the genre."
5,Great Read,I thought this book was a good read. Read this in one day. Would read more by this author and genre.
4,Loved it!!!,"Well, this was my first book to read from DJ Daniels, It was amazing. Loved the plot from the beginning to end. It was a suspense that you really could not figure out who was the bad guy. Dana's broken heart, teaches to always look into the facts before judging. Overall an A Plus..."
3,"Ok book, with a lousy ending.","I could have done without the premarital sex (none of which was horribly explicit but I would prefer it not be there at all) but the book was otherwise enjoyable. At least it was right up until the end. It's almost as if the author was too lazy to write the final chapter. It left me feeling like I was missing something. The mystery was solved for the most part but the author left at least a half dozen loose ends untied at the end of the book. I was pretty disappointed. If you read Harlequins because you enjoy the neat, tidy resolutions then this book isn't for you."
4,Wish we had cowboys like that around my way. Good Read!,I wont give anything away but for being a free book not bad! I absolutley LOVE the charecters and the plot. Total mind blowing ending that you would never imagine! All in all good book :)
4,liked it...didnt love it,I felt there could have been a lot more development of the characters. I thought the book focused more on the past relationship of Dana and Hud rather than the crime. The crime was summed up in 1 chapter. You dont get to see what happens after that. Heres the crime...we love each other...the end. Not a bad read but I wish things would have developed more.
3,Not the black salve you might think it is!,"I got this when I needed to get rid of a boil under my arm. I was disappointed to see it wasn't the black salve we had used some years ago--the active ingredient is benzocaine 20%.The ointment does numb the pain of the boil, but it isn't a drawing salve. The boil doesn't come to a quicker end.If you require pain relief, this will do the job, but if you are looking for something to get draw out the pus and getrid of a nasty boil quickly, look for some other product."
2,Not what I expected.,"I thought these would be useful in scrapbooking and that they would work like embossing powders. They didn't work like that, but there was absolutely nothing to describe how to use them in a different way. Could've been more descriptive with the product beforehand, and the product itself could've contained more information about its use."
4,pants,I'm wearing them right now. They are one of my favorite pairs. I wear them at least once a week. They have been washed at least 100 times and are still.just as sturdy
4,Excellent playing of less challenging Sor repertoire,"Not the usual choice of pieces for a player of Jason Vieaux's calibre, but hearing the intermediate level exercises of Sor's Opus 44 played by him is a rewarding experience nonetheless. This also increased my appreciation for Sor's genius in composing relatively simple but listenable classical guitar compositions. Although not the most recorded pieces or the most memorable compositions of the greatest guitar composer ever, this CD is still worth listening to.Recommended."
1,Zzzzzzzzzz,"I liked Ulver's work up through Themes from William Blake's the Marriage of Heaven and Hell (great album that), but ever since they've been less and less interesting. Perdition City at least varied things a bit, even if the end product was not very impressive. This album is basically one long electronic doodle. It's almost a stretch to call it musical, much less enjoyable. If you need some random background electronic beeping to help you fall aslepp, go into a trance, or dierct planes from Air Traffic Control, you might find a use for this, but if you're wanting a listenable, enjoyable, musical experience, best look elsewhere. I can appreciate Garn's experimental aspirations, but this is just lame, and I won't be wasting any more of my time or $ on his future recordings"
1,"""This product is not effective on the scalp or nails."" This is a quote from the insert!","Why would you call call your product Fungi Nail Anti-fungal Solution, and then state it doesn't work on nails?I call this false advertising !"
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted this product to work.. it just didn't. To be honest I have a hard time believing the picture on the product box. My nail was not as bad as the one in the picture and I saw little to no improvement over almost 2 months. I followed the instructions on the bottle, applying to the infected area twice a day (once in the A.M. after showering and once at night) and nothing seemed to improve. During this time I also noticed the fungus just starting to spread to the adjacent nail so I really tried to lather this stuff on and under the nail. Still didn't stop it from happening. If you are someone who is prone to having reoccurring nail issues I could see using the product to be proactive, but for as far as curing a current infection I wouldn't recommend it. Its not terribly expensive, so its worth a shot if you wanna try it but for me it just didn't work."
2,Misleading - package says 'does not treat nail fungus',"I should have done a little more research, but when I received this product, it clearly says that it is not effective on nail fungus. I just thought that a product called ""Fungi-Nail"" would work on FUNGUS on NAILS. Oh well. You live, you learn."
4,"so far, so good....","It's hard to fully assess this stuff yet, but so far, with use of about 2 weeks, I am seeing a difference with that ugly black fungus that I am getting on my toenails. How the stuff began I do not know...what I do know is that I want it to go away and I'll try this for a while before considering oral medication from a podiatrist..."
5,Use with Tea Tree Oil for Qucker and Longer Lasting Results,"I used this product alone in the past and it totally worked as advertised however it took a few months to completely eliminate the fungus. This was not a surprise to me because I already knew that nail fungus is not easy to get rid of and it sometimes it takes even longer than a few months for medications to fully kick in. Late last year, it came back in the same areas so I used this solution again but in conjunction with actual tea tree oil (100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Bars) which I read was another effective remedy for treating nail fungus. Well, within a month I saw results and a couple weeks later the fungus was gone again. It's been almost a year and it has not come back so I recommend using tea tree oil along with this product for quicker and longer lasting results."
1,I give up,"I have used a bottle of this product judiciously after showers morning and night, rarely skipping an application. The bottle is now empty. Sorry to say that both my large toes still have fungus. I trimmed, cut, sanded,I even used a high speed roto tool to remove as much infected toenail as I could. Still no improvement, at least not to the extent others claim. If you read the very very small print on the side it states, ""This product is not effective on the scalp or toenails..."" The packaging implies otherwise. Well, now I am going to try another product called Mycocide, we'll see how that goes."
3,Its good but not great,I have a ps2 unlike these other bashers its fine i get games before xbox and gamecube but im gonna pick up an xbox as well because of it being the most powerful system and having the best graphics. Others will say power doesnt matter but its the only other good system and i usually have had 2 consoles. The gamecube is disapointing besides having more ram and being able to show 8 textures at once its only a little more powerful that the ps2. The games on gamecube is alot more disappointing for the older gamer. I would recomend the gamecube for someone under the age of 12. Steer clear of gamecube if your not in that age group or you'll go insane by pokemon some other childish series of games. Nintendo is also known for delaying and canceling games. If ya want a system now get the ps2 if your patient get xbox.
5,DVD Playback,"I just want to say a few words about DVD playback, first of all a few people say that in order to play DVD's you need a remote control that is NOT true. You can still play DVD's without remote control just use the controller instead. I played around 20 movies on it and had no problems. When it to comes to games they are exciting and fun to play for many hours. The only thing missing so far is the lack of online games, but supposely Sony is coming out with online gaming next Spring. I love my PS2 and I am sure you will love it too."
3,WEAK!!!,"This was a very disappointing CD from Water Music Records...The album concept is totally unoriginal--Uhh, Hello!! ""Black Martini"" already has a martini glass on the cover!! Also, the songs on this set do very little for the ""Dinner at Eight"" theme. Lemongrass' ""I Love You"" and ORG Lounge's ""Less Ugh!"" are the only reasons why I bought this CD, and even they get boring after repeated listenings. Julia Messenger's ""Telepathy"" is good, but by the time you get to it, you're so uninterested in the CD that it falls short. The only songs that fit the concept of ""Dinner at Eight""--which I'm assuming is supposed to be piano-laced music with a jazz flava'-- are Slowpho's ""Before I Wake"" and Ohm Guru's ""Please Please Please."" Buy at your own risk or if you're just trying to impress dinner guests with your ""pseudo-riche"" music collection. And y'all thought I would never write a bad review for a Water Music Records comp CD."
2,Marks a Decline,"Anne Barbour has always written interesting books with strong characters. Unfortunately, her recent novels have taken a turn into what might be termed ""speculative history."" In an introductory note, she points out that her story is ""how it might have happened."" The problem is that her proposed turn of events doesn't really make sense, and isn't consistent with her characters. I've read two of this new style of Barbour novel, and won't read any more."
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"I don't like this book for following reasons:- The source code can't be used on a project due to bugs and poor quality.- The author does not know what Java Beans are but goes on to provide a buggy utility class.- About 30% of the book is dedicated to non XML related concepts such as EJBs and Servelts etc.,- Does not explain the concepts of DOM L1/L2 in detail.- Does not describe JAXP in sufficient detail.There are few more reasons, but I will stop here due to lack of time...The landscape of Java & XML is very dynamic. There are lots of good books on XML but there are no good ones that provide good conent in the context of Java and JAXP. There is no point in buying this book unless company is paying for it."
5,"secure wires, calbles, electric cords, and even heavy yarn",These twist ties are just about indispensible. I am so glad I found a supply for them.I had been getting them along with cables for computer accessories. I have 4 different sizes and have uses for all of them. Thank you. Patty
1,Not worth the money,This item started to break before I could even put it together. The different pieces wouldn't stay in and would move with minimal pressure. I will stick with the edgers that don't change. I would give this a 0 if I could.
1,The tiles slide right off the holder....,"I was very excited about this product at first because there are many different designs you could make on the side of the cake but when I actually received it and tried to use it, the tiles fell right off. I couldn't believe I wasted my money on this item. I should have read the reviews on it before hand. Now I am determined to make a holder of my own so that I may use the tiles it came with. For a Wilton product, I am very disappointed and hope that others won't waste their money on this.~Bethany"
4,Going raw? start here,"This is a good book to start with if you're thinking of going raw. All the basics are here. The author encourages you to start slowly and introduce raw foods gradually into your diet rather than going raw overnight. On this diet, it is so important to food combine properly, which is explained in the book. Also, she includes easily digestible foods that are not raw. I would have given this book 5 stars, but she did not fully explain that apples and lemons can be combined with vegetables, so I think it looks like she is contradicting herself when she includes a recipe with apples, lemon, and greens. Earlier in the book she says that fruit must be eaten alone. Also, she says that avocado is metabolized as a starch, but all other food combining sources say it is a protien. It's okay that she has a differing opinion, but she doesn't state why she thinks so. Read this, get what you can from it, but also do your homework and read from other sources, as well. Gourmet Raw is also good."
1,Not the best raw foods book out there...,"I have read a lot of raw foods books since becoming interested in the diet and this one is probably the worst. It includes instructions on how to give yourself an enema, and several recipes that are not raw foods. If you wanted just an ordinary cook book it could have just said that. I recommend David Wolfe's Eating for Beauty. That was the most informative about the diet and it has some delicious recipes in it. I also don't think you should eat raw meat, which she suggested in this book. It can in fact make you very sick and it doesn't sound that appealing to me."
4,Excellent value for money,"This little book was recommended to me by a trusted friend and it has proved to be one of my best buys. I too would recommend it to anyone trying to lose a little weight painlessly and stay healthy at the same time. The green lemonade recipe is easy to follow and provides the simplest way to obtain your ""5-a-day"" and get those anti-oxidents into your system every morning."
2,Disheartening for newbies,"I purchased this book the same week I was learning (and very excited about) ""green smoothies."" I was anxious to learn more about incorporating the ""raw food diet"" and believed this book would help in that transition. In reality though, the food combining information completely confused me and discouraged me from this way of eating. In addition, the author states multiple times that one should never eat fruit with any other type of food, so now my green smoothies were no longer looking so great. I am looking elsewhere for information to get started on a raw diet with simpler explanations and no strict rules about what to eat at what time of day, etc. - much better for a newbie like me."
2,Great in theory...,"I am glad I checked this book out of the library because this diet just won't pan out in my life. She makes some good points about eating healthy raw foods, but the section most important to me 'Raw on a Budget' tiptoed around the fact that you can't afford the really good raw stuff unless you've got plenty of disposable income, but if you really want to make it work you'll magically find the money. I will take away healthier choices, but going through a head of celery a day for some juice and getting monthly colonics while brushing your body daily is more Hollywood than real life. Mostly this book will just make you feel bad about the food you're going to keep eating because living raw isn't totally viable for average people."
1,"Junk ""Science""","Be wary of a book that claims fact after fact after fact and has no sources. After 100 pages (ugh!) we learn to cut McDonalds, drink water, and cut sugar, caffeine, and alcohol. And then it goes off the deep end. This book just wildly starts making accusations. I""m still not sure why I am supposed to cut dairy.This book is a poorly written vegan manifesto. The recipes are even subpar compared to plain old internet vegan recipes."
1,Goes against what all other dieticians say,"Natalia Rose has an unhealthy obsession with poo, plus she thinks you can gobble down tons of avocados and coconuts (both teaming with calories and fat) and still loose weight! She also wants you to skip breakfast--one of the key things every other dietitian tells you NOT to do! This ""diet"" left me feeling light-headed and nauseous. I need real food, not juice and water. This book is for crazy people."
4,Great book!,This is a great book to get infomation on how to start a RAW food lifestyle. It has some recipes and tips on how to start off and get on a healthier eating path.
5,Good Intro Book,"This book was the first I'd read on Raw Food. I'm interested in health and nutrition and read a variety of books in that area. This book was well written, explaining the pros of raw food. As any diet book, it has menus and ideas, but this book has several stages to 'ease' you onto raw foods. I like how the health benefits are tied into how your body works. I've bought this book for others, and shared my copy of the book with friends. It even inspired me to go out and get a juicer, something I've been thinking about for years, but have never done."
2,What's with the black stuff?,"I got this as part of a larger set (bought elsewhere) as a gift. While I've had a blast shaking and making cocktails, I noticed that the ink on the sides of the mixing glass comes off when wet. I thought it was the rubber gasket around the top, but found after discarding the gasket one night, the glass chipped easily, causing me to waste a drink.Great price for an introductory shaker, but really the better ones and clear mixing glasses are pennies in comparison.Also, after mixing about 10 drinks, the gasket becomes so loose that it falls off."
3,Oggi Shaker set,"the shaker doesn't fit together well. the gasket is very thin. i bought it to replace one that had broken, i used the glass as a replacement. the model they made before this one works well."
5,A True Teacher,Paul Grilley is one of the most knowledgeable teachers I have ever met. The depth of his understanding of anatomy is inspiring. This two disc set is a must have for all yoga teachers; it will boost your knowledge and your teaching skills. I recommend anything that Paul puts on the market and his workshops to all teachers and students; who wish to develop a better understanding of asana and why no two people do an asana in the same way.
5,Excellent!,"This two DVD set is a real investment.You may only watch the educational DVD once, but the actual practice DVD you will probably use hundreds of times. That assumes you like yin yoga.I had not done any before buying this set. Since then, I have become a real devotee.In addition to this DVD, I use the Sarah Powers Yin Practice, I think its title is Insight Yoga, and Erin Flemming's CD.All are wonderful in their own ways.Paul's is a great place to start as he gives excellent instruction in the actual poses. He also shows people with different types of flexibility,and ways to adapt the practice to your own unique body. He offers a variety of yin practices as well as some very creative and fluid yang options.Sarah's has a Buddhist slant that appeals to me. She has two yin practices: one for the kidneys and one for the liver. She also includes hatha vinyasa, savasana, and meditation.Erin's is only a one hour practice, but it's very well rounded and a delight to do."
5,fantastic!,"I bought this DVD already three times and gave it as a gift to friends. I can highly recommend this dvd to people, who look for a relaxing and healing yoga practice!"
3,Buyer Be Cautious,"This Yin Yoga DVD set contains a great description of the theory/principles of the Yin Yoga practice. The audio/verbal cues are clear, concise, and easy to follow. However, I would recommend this Yoga for experienced practitioners ONLY. The poses are defintiely not suitable for those just beginning to explore the wonderful benefits of yoga. (The poses are held too long for beginners.)"
2,"If Only This Was A 12"" Collection","Cool cover, that's all I can really say. One of the greatest bands of the 80's, one of the greatest bands ever. If this was all 12"" versions, then this would be a different story. Why would you get this when you can get all of Alphaville's individual albums like I did?!? All of their albums are great so instead of wasting your money, save your money to get the albums instead. Why won't the record company release the best of Alphaville ""The Extended Versions & B-sides""?"
4,Vostok Rocket N1,"Out of the boc, the watch was fast by 15 minutes every two weeks. After adjustment, it was off only 20 seconds every two weeks. It's hard to find replacement rubber seals for the back. The leather band had white stitching on it so care has to be taken during use to keep it clean. Loved the dual time capability and the big dial-makes it easy to read at night. The black hydride coating is wearing well-no scratches or dings yet.Only complaint is that the date cannot be set independently so there was a lot of winding initially to get the correct value. I've got a watch winder now."
4,perfect for small apartment,+veSmall sizeLite waitslim shape can be stored any where.beg less.-vemore noise (this will be issue with all small size vacums because they can not implement noise reduction)not good for stairsneed to empty after every use.filters are very expensive (most expensive in all eureks filters.)
4,does what it's suppose to do,"I've only used a few times, but it works just fine. Not a cleaner for the lazy. Filter should be cleaned after each use especially if you have inside animals. Works great at picking up pet hair. I'm in a wheelchair so the light weight is really nice. I'll buy another when this one goes."
5,Grerat light vacuum cleaner,This is a super light vacuum and great for use all around the house.Easy to assemble and clean. Very happy with purchase.
4,Works fine!,"We've been using this with our Windows XP system for about a month now. The driver installation was quick and easy, and the physical hookup as simple as could be asked for (short of wireless).Performance has been quite good between our small home network (1 Windows, 1 Mac, and 1 firewall) and the cable Internet service that I use. I don't have any precise measurements but we've been completely happy.We don't communicate between our two home systems (yet) so I can't report anything about that.A previous reviewer mentioned a faulty USB cable coming with the device. I didn't even notice at first that a USB cable was included--it was hidden under a cardboard insert."
3,Works as advertised,"The dasboard of my car does not have a flat place close enough to the driver. The base-to-screen angle starts at 90deg. and lays down to about 135deg. Unfortunately the curvature of my dash is the opposite...it would have been better if the angle went the other way (tilting forward instead of backward). Anyway, the display is a little too small and the backlight feature is a little dim (unless my batteries a going out...which is a possibility since I live in Alaska and the cold saps batteries!)"
2,Useless,"It didn't malfunction but it's clunky and the temp gauge is really useless because you never get an accurate reading really.Really a waste of money so don't bother. I learned the hard way with investing the money into this thing....just skip this and get a GPS like I eventually did,.....much more worth the money...."
2,I had better,I have used this item for about a week. I first had the gauge within the dial area in front of the steering wheel but the temperature didn't represent that in the rest of the car. I have moved it to a more central location and it appears to be more accurate now. I have used the digital compass and it has yet to indicated the correct direction. Not sure what the problem is.
2,Not very accurate,"We have set and reset our compass and it doesn't come out true, according to maps. It seems to be about 15-20 degrees off. Plus the thermometer doesn't really work very well either. I'm disappointed in this device."
3,Where do I put it?,"This is a cool compass with all the info I wanted. The only problem is I have had a hard time figuring out where to put it. I have a 2005 F-250, and it looks funny dead center on top of the dash. I wish it was all one flat piece. Then I could stick it on the front of the dash some where."
4,useful technique,"I don't like book translations, so i bought this book at Amazon.France, french language. I't a good companion to John Bollinger book.This work features interesting visual approach, with studies of slopes and shapes of bollinger bands."
2,Not for all motherboards,"Check your motherboard at the manufacturer web site. I'm sure this product is wonderful, but all I can do now is return it or use it for a paperweight. Neither of my 2 motherboards have the ""cooler mounting holes around the CPU socket"". (These are needed because, depending on the version, its either very heavy, or very very heavy). This is noted in the fine print on the back of the packaging, but I have to fault Amazon for not noting it in the product description. Even at that, the Zalman web site covers not even half the motherboards out there, which in turn may or may not have the special holes in them. If you are replacing an existing noisy fan you will have to completely remove your motherboard to get to its back side and mount things."
5,Great book,"Yes, the yarn listed is very expensive. However, it really isn't that difficult to substitute. Contrary to some of the earlier reviews, smaller women are still REAL women, and these patterns are a great fit. The patterns are beautiful, not super difficult, and it is one of my favorite knitting books. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
1,Pacman has better gameplay than WCW Mayhem...,"EA's WCW Mayhem was a very large let down once i got a hold of it. I found that the gameplay was irritating and the moves were annoyingly assigned to the wrong buttons. I compare this game to THQ's WWF 2000 and you can really notice the difference. For the wrestling game fan i advice you, although the fact that you can wrestle in other places than the ring (backstage etc...), do not buy this game. You WILL be disappointed. Hopefully EA will learn from its mistakes. And better luck to them next time..."
2,Mayhem get's counted out!,"If you've played, or own WCW/nWo Revenge, get ready for a playing let-down, Mayhem's graphics are very good, but the gameplay resembles WWF Warzone on a bad day! I found the controlling the moves and punches were a little difficult, also the punches themselves look very lame indeed. overall I was very disapointed in this game. Don't waste your money on this one, If you don't own, or ever played WCW/nWo Revenge, by all means get that one instead!"
1,Good for short time...,You can only set the timer up to 99 minutes and 99 seconds. So you're out of luck when you have a 3 hour roast in the oven. It also easily falls off of the refrigerator because of it size.
4,"Good product, a little more info on details would be better","Product is exactly what I ordered. I don't have the resources to review the product itself. This review is about it's description in Amazon and the delivery process.I would have appreciated a little more info in detailed product specs. There are quite a few variants on quantity and packaging. For the expert, no problem, but for a novice, a more detailed intro would be good.Delivery was just fine. The only, and minor, issue is that delivery was not trackable, probably due to third party supplier.That said, I will certainly consider Amazon for products like hibiclens again. Other than the minor details noted, Amazon's excellent customer service is evident."
5,I love this stuff,This is a great product. I sweat a lot so I use it as an underarm deodorant. It keeps the smell at bay.
5,Hibiclens,I have a skin disorder called Hidradenitis Suppurativa so it is neccesary for me to use a very good skin cleanser. This was reccomended to me by 2 plastic surgeons and a dermatologist. It works great.to keep areas prone to breakouts clean and odor free. Follow the directions on the bottle.
3,Horrible game but great movie,"I purchase this game for one reason and one reason only, it was a cheap way to get the Hard Boiled Movie. Note that the movie is not in HD, so do not expect a 1080p transfer of the movie. I really like the movie, unfortunately, that did not translate to the game. This game remind me too much of Max Payne, with BulletTime and everything, except Max Payne was developed for PS2 and Stranglehold's graphic is about just as good as that. Overall, I think I played a total of 20 minutes of the game, but have watched the movie numerous time. For $6.99, its not bad."
2,"Good effort, but . . .","I bought this book because my co-worker raved about it, and I thought the title was enticing. When I read the book however, I was disappointed because there were so many grammatical errors and typos it was disappointing (Did the writer have an editor read a copy before publishing?). In addition the concept of a woman dying from being(oversexed)for the lack of a more appropriate word, is mythological. I must give props to the author for even writing this book, as well as publishing it himself. If you don't mind reading a mediocre book, by all means buy this book, however, if you're looking for something substantial, with solid characters and plot that will hold your attention please look elsewhere."
4,Great Practical Sturdy Compact Stand,"Got a 12"" Dewalt miter saw on this stand and have no complaints.I install wood floors and remodel.The stand is quick and easy to set up and mount the saw.Its sturdy and serves the purpose like it should.It breaks down to 46"" wide for easy storage. Good for job boxes!I would buy another one."
3,"Intellectual, not personal","I must disagree with some of the reviewers here, and some of the reviewers on the book jacket. I didn't find these memoirs very personal at all. It read more like an annotated bibliography than anything else; anyone who wants to know which 20th century thinkers Benedict XVI thinks are important must begin here. To be sure, there are reflections on pleasant scenes from Ratzinger's life, but these are fairly generic (which is to say, they're things you might expect to find in anyone's life). In fact, I found ""Salt of the Earth"" more revealing of the man, since it is in interview format."
5,Love it!!,Must husband had a ring like this (that he lost on the golf course) - only in gold. We bought this ring as a interim replacement & he still wears it! For the price - a perfect purchase!
4,A bit of a slow starter - really three and a half stars.,"Marcoux is an excellent writer, but the setup on this one was a bit slow. It did keep me reading, although I didn't find it a page-turner. About one third of the way in, the pace picked up and I found it harder to put down. Jessie Mercer is a complex and interesting writer/woman with some paranormal talents and the ability to tap into other levels of being; this makes her life complicated when her novels and research foreshadow events in her life. In this book she meeets many beings from her past lives and becomes entangled in their machinations. Hard to believe? Yes, but fascinating reading. One more look at the Merovingian 'heresy', but it isn't the focus of the book. It will be interesting to see where Marcoux takes Mercer from here."
1,Bad,"This Cd is better than the rest but it is still the same thing, the songs are horrible (exept Esperanza and Nunca te Olvidar√©)and they put them so much on the radio that I am getting tired of them. Enrique Iglesias does not know how to sing and he thinks he it the greatest thing on this universe. It seems like if he is crying, has a stomach ache, and pushing(like if he is going to deliver a baby or something) while he is singing. A waste of money and time."
1,A terrible mix of junky songs and unpleasant voice.,Enrique Iglesias is so bad that the only way his music would ever be considered decent would be if the rest of the Latin singers died of the plague. I feel sorry for anyone over the age of 14 who likes this marketed commodity masquerading as music. It seems any no-talent can get popular these days! Don't waste your money on this filth.
1,Disappointed,I'm not going to ramble on about the book. It was the first book I've read by Martha Grimes and probably the last.
2,Disappointing two-star effort for a five-star writer,"There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed, for one, It took longer than any of the rest of the stuff I bought to be shipped, then when i finally got it, I had to fix it. It came to me broken. Very upset. Sure I could have sent it back but shoot, then I would have waited however long AGAIN to get it."
5,"I LOVED THIS BOOK, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!","Gabriel's Ghost is a fantastic book!!! It's a puzzle of compelling pieces set into a beautifully finished, futuristic landscape--one you can't wait to finish. The tale enthralled me with its constant action, adventure, and a gripping love story. Linnea Sinclair has mastered the difficult skill of weaving a futuristic world with a detailed science fiction setting that can't be topped... all of this... balanced with an equally captivating story. Don't miss Linnea Sinclair's Gabriel's Ghost!!!"
4,Fun Read,"Will have to finish this review quickly so I can look through Ms. Sinclair's catalog to figure out which book I want to read next. This is my first L.Sinclair book but it won't be my last. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and characters. I loved Sully's vulnerability. I would have given this 5 stars but in the end I did get a little tired of Chaz learning about Sully's abilities one spoonful at a time: it wasn't as convincing, towards the end, for him not to trust her anymore and I was slightly skeezed that he was less than truthful about ""Ky'sara"" at first.That small criticism aside Gabriel's Ghost was great. Must go purchase more books.Debbie"
3,"The Roommate, Yet Another 'Try-Hard' Thrill Film","'The Roommate' is just another thrilling movie that is shown in theaters. Yes, there they have some 'jumpy' moments, but overally, it may seem a little less too boring. The plot itself is very predictable and a little bit old. *Spoiler* It was about Sara, a new college student who just moved in on her dorm, and meeting her new roommate, Rebecca. You will immediately know what Rebecca plans when you see the trailer. She wants to be Sara's friend, her VERY close friend. She overprotects her, and whatnot.I want to give this movie four stars because of it's great bestfriends scenes, but I can't. Some roles/actors were just thrown in the movie for no apparent reasons. Like Irene and Jason.If this DVD come out, I would definitely buy it, because, frankly, I kind of liked the movie. And if you have nothing to do on your freetime, this movie is definitely worth it!"
2,An ok movie... at best!,"OK, I saw this in theaters. Thank GOD i didn't have to pay for that ticket.This movie just, isn't all that good. I mean for teens i guess its all that but you kinda see everything coming. She's crazy and wants people to like her. And to make it sexy they throw in some girl on girl action for about a few min.I hate movies when you know how it ends before you sit in the seat at the theater."
3,"What's on TV? Ok, good.","This is what should be standard TV. Some of its jokes are funny, and some are tired. And a few ones are truly inspired (restaurant set, an immigration lawyer working for poor people looking for their American Dream, you need to see it to understand how great a moment that is). But that's it by now. I watched half of this first season' episodes and ""How I Met Your Mother"" is not. However, the relationship between the characters seem (for once) adult-like, and for those people in their forties the subject matter of the series is going to be pretty relevant (hey, 3 stars is good!)."
2,nothing special,"This book is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it because there are better, more ""ultimate"" options.I personally don't enjoy the tone/humor. It's verbose and feels like advice from my grandmother, which may include very good points, but muddled in an old-fashioned voice.More importantly, the content is broad, but lacks depth. I have more often referenced ""Baby 411"" and the AAP's ""Caring for Your Baby and Young Child"" as well as a handful of books on specific topics such as ""Baby Bargains"" for gear and ""The Nursing Mother's Companion"" for breastfeeding."
2,Too much focus on pregnancy and newborns,"I would say this book was a large disappointment to me. I expected a book that would be of use for a year, as it said on the cover. I was surprised that it was of very little relevance to me, a mother of a 2 month old. More than half the book is devoted to pregnancy, birth, and newborn care. I did not need information on pregnancy or birth, and the newborn care and information could have been condensed into one chapter. This book is very unbalanced towards young infancy. If you have a baby who is older than a week or two, you'll get very little out of it. However, if you are pregnant, perhaps it would be an OK book. But for a book that calls itself The Mother of all Baby Books, I expected more about babies 0-12 months, less about pregnancy and basic newborn care."
2,Rather diapointed in this book...,"While this book has some good information in it, finding that info is harder than it should be. A subject will be brought up several times throughout the book, but only some of the instances will be listed in the index, which makes finding something you read a while ago very tough. It also seems that some basic & important topics are not mentioned or are barely so. The book is also not organized very well, making it hard to guess where you might find the info that you are looking for.I've gone out and purchased some other baby books and found them far more helpful and easy to use."
1,Slick!!,"Leave it to Disney to put their name behind Fall Out Boy T-Shirts as well as this overwrought disaster ""starring"" Stephen Dorff. This is quite honestly one of the most pretentious, smarmy movies I have ever seen. It's slickness goes beyond distraction; a character that has to choose between being something like a Euro-trash director or a remarkably superficial relationship with a model. ""Entropy"" almost taunts its viewers with the notion that a life of intrigue depends on the relative shallowness of its most important characters. Slickly made and with style for style's sake cinematography, its direction immediately dates it to the late nineties, a work of film-school camera tricks and Hollywood malaise that's beyond condescending. Joanou never tries to get us to like Dorff's character, but to be honest, we've already decided not to by the time the opening credits have finished.."
5,Song list,"I'm not here to write a review, you either like it or you don't. But I am here to help out a few of the song junkies like myself sooth that aching pain of not finding a certain song or soundtrack. I've only seen the movie once, so I'm pulling these out of my head of what I remember being in the movie - I don't have a complete list, I'll try and repost it if I ever find them.The U2 Songs are easy to find, just scour the net a bit.A few that come to mind are:U2 - Mofo among the other harder to find ones.Bran Van 3000 - Drinking in L.A. :: This is the haunting pulse song that seems to resonate during the movie, you'll know it when you hear it.And..Im drawing a serious blank. One was titled Vultures, another Female Species, and Sea - those I remember reading during the credits. Sorry I can't be of more help.Good luck on your search."
1,Would not recommend,"This may be the only book i have ever given up on. I labored through the first 50 pages, skimmed the next 50 pages, and had to stop reading. Was unbearably boring. The writing style is very choppy and unpleasant to read."
4,Nice Size,"I have had this for over a year and have been happy since day one. Nicely weighted, does not topple over. It is at the back door so it catches everyone as they come in, no more coats and sweaters hanging on chairs. Plus the design is very pleasing to the eye."
2,An average book on treatment planning in radiotherapy,"In my view not the best book by this author. The previous book Physics of Radiation Therapy described in minute detail the fundamental physics, and with that was particularly aimed at the novice in Radiotherapy Physics. This book is much more general in nature and provides an overview of what is/should be state-of-the art in radiotherapy treatment planning. However, people active in the field should be familiar with that, and in that respect this book offers not much new. Despite my criticism it is a convenient overview in just one book."
4,Recommended for Understanding RT; for Dosimetry etc,"Understanding various aspects of RT in a concise manner from the experts themselves is very appealing. The editors have done a good work of collating the best from the minds in the advancing fields of RT, 3DCRT, IMRT, brachytherapy and STRT. All these topics are presented with contrasting Isodose profiles and respective techniques; give a good grasp of the subjects that form the basis of today's best work aimed for in established radiation oncology treatment centers.The important aspect of the book is in keeping it simple to understand. This is great and emphasizes the use of the techniques in practical terms rather than in a less appealing theoretical concept.I recommend it to every dosimetrist, like myself, RTs, oncologists, and even medical physicists. A must have for every upcoming student in Radiation Oncology. Thanks to Dr.Khan and Dr.Potish.Pannir T. Selvam. RT(T) MHSMDosimetristSingapore"
5,GBA SP,"As each grand-child approaches their 5th birthday/Christmas, this is the gift of choice. There's a wide variety of games available - making future presents a snap!!Our family has ordered 6 so far!!! They are small and quite easy to carry around but big enough for tiny (over 5 yrs) fingers to use."
5,Great DVD!!,"DVD was used, but like NEW condition. no sratches. My two year old loves it and will watch it like its a new episode every time it goes in the DVD player. thanks."
5,My granddaughter loves it!,We purchased this to take on a long road trip with our 3 and 1/2 year old granddaughter. She already loved WordWorld and this 2 disc set allowed for more selection and many hours of viewing. Since our return she has been trying to sound out words just like on WordWorld!
4,Very useful product and decent sound quality,"This is a pretty good product when you need to have hands free to do other work while speaking on the phone. When calling other LAN lines with handsets, the other party cannot tell you are using a wireless headset where the sound quality is fantastic on both ends. However, if the other end is using a speakerphone, I've had a few complaints of a little bit of echo, so I'd have to pick up my handset."
2,Wears out too quick,"I thought these would be great for taking the fuzz off some carvings I made with my Carvewright machine. They begin to work but wear out so quickly that you end up using several for one job. That adds too much cost to the project. I could make it work if they were around $1 each, but not at this price. I still have not found the perfect accessory to smooth these carvings."
1,Taking Bob Prechters advice will ruin you financially.,"Avoid this book !!!Prechters view is markets peaked in wave 5 in year 2000.Never called the bottom in 2002, and stated thehigh of year 2000 would not be surpassed.Well 6 years later the DOW has indeed surpassed the year 2000 high!Listening to his advice would cost one dearly.Not only missing out on the recent market rise, but also constantlypushing one to take a bearish stance against the market during theentire rise over the past 3 plus years, while the market was rising!"
4,I got taken!,"This book was sold to me as new, but was full of someone else's comments and highlighting in several colors, most of which made the print difficult to read. It wasn't just here and there. Every chapter was full of highlighted text, much of it in dark green. I bought it mid semester as a supplement text, so I didn't have time to fool around with getting it exchanged for a new one. I've been had!"
5,"...cleverly produced, kept simple and up-to-date...","First, I'd like to start off saying that I expected this video to disappoint me. There are very few decent instructional videos that relate to goalies, and even fewer that keep the current style of play in consideration. Most of the ones I have bought seem to be so outdated, the demonstrators are wearing old leather equipment and teach skate saves (old school). When I came across this, I decided to risk it. The risk turned out to be pleasantly rewarding and entertaining. The video uses 3 different goalies of various ages demonstrating the techniques. The style seems to promote the ""butterfly"" without abusing it. There are mental toughness quotes that occur after each segment which is a nice added bonus. The goalie coach is narrating throughout the whole video, and keeps the commentary short and simple. I think that any goalie can relate and benefit from watching this. Highly recommended!"
5,Loved it,"For me, this was the perfect blend of traditional hymns with interesting musical spins put on them. I especially love the blues-tinged version of Amazing Grace and the African pieces.I think there's something very likeable and strong about the group -- I just discovered them from a piece on a WOW Worship CD and really enjoy them. Their voices are really good, the piano is great, and I love the harmonies. Their music definitely touches me.It sounds as though the original trio has partially disbanded. I hope they all get back together and make lots more CDs. I think they're terrific."
2,It is ok !,I do not think this is their greatest album. It is an ok album but not as good as I was hoping.
4,This is nice music,"I was not as impressed with this CD as I had hoped to be.It is nice, but not spectacular. I always search for albums where I love every song(Steven Curtis Chapman's ""Re-creation"")"
4,Replacement power cord.,"We purchase appliances to meet our household needs and expect them to last for many years. However, that doesn't take into consideration a lost power cord. Some of the power cords seem to get misplaced thru the years and it becomes necessary to secure a replacement. Seems that the original manufacture will have the necessary replacements but that is not always the case. Amazon to our rescue. Their products and not only available, but meet the requirements of our needs. Always look to them before you give up."
4,Feel-good book!,"I liked this book very much. Frisco is a tough, accomplished guy, but has been discouraged by an injury, which makes him think he has to resign from the Navy. His niece is dumped on him, and he comes through as a great guy. He does a lot of growing, because he loves her. There are dangers to avoid, though - not so easy for a man with a bum leg. The romantic part of this book is good also. I'll leave you to discover that yourself."
3,Computer System Reliability ISBN: 0471276340,"This book concerns the reliability for computer systems, it is both a comprehensive and mathematical reference that describes for the reader the process of calculating the system reliability of the computer concerning all the components inside it."
1,Not good for serious chewers,"I got each of my dogs a Christmas gift, and this was the first one to reach the trash can because within minutes the plastic was breaking off as it was chewed on. I purchased the large thinking it would be more challenging for my 20 pound dogs to destroy. WRONG! This may be good for a dog that doesn't have much chewing power, but it's not for Jack Russells, that's for sure."
2,Lasted 10 minutes,"We have a Weimaraner and she chewed this up in 10 minutes into pieces. Also, it breaks down into small plastic pieces which was all over the carpet and i dont think it is good for the dog to swallow. I do not recommend this for a Medium to large dog who is an agressive chewer"
5,Keeps 'em chewing... and not on your shoes!,"This is a great product. It keeps my dog occupied for hours and cleans his teeth too. The best part is it lasts forever and does not stink like rawhide or other chew bones (especially cow hooves, YUCK). I have a small dog (yorkie) and I especially like this product because I don't have to worry about him choking on it. Of course, like with all doggie toys you have to supervise them but I believe this product to be safer than some others out there. I bought two of them and put one away since they last for such a long time."
2,"Dogs loved, but they fell apart!","My dog loved it, but it fell apart very quickly. I will never buy again!"
4,great dog chew!,I have had this for a few months now and my dog still pulls it out and loves to chew on it. The hard outside keeps her from gobbling up all the yummy stuff.
1,Dissapointed,"I purchased this toy because it came up when I typed in ""Hypo-allergenic Dog bone."" My dog has some pretty severe allergies and I was looking for a great toy to fight boredom. The minute I opened the package of this bone the smell hit me. It has a pretty stinky scent. AND, within an hour of giving this toy to my dog, she had some pretty severe gas! I ended up tossing it. So, needless to say, I wouldn't recommend it.The seller was great though. Great price and timely delivery. The product itself was just disappointing."
5,magical!,"i don't know what to say... i have no words to describe this divine cd! if anyone heard the album Moment Of Glory they should know what i am talking about. the collaboration with the orchestra is one of the best things the scorps have ever done during their career. this track is a ballad, and this fact only should prepare us for a wonderful listening to Meine's voice. this time he is doing a duet with a young amarican singer, whose voice combines perfectly with Klaus`. The music is good too, the band plays in such grace with the orchestra, it just lifts up the spirit in the best way you can think of. i recommend this cd with all my heart, it's a pleasure which only the scorps can provide."
1,Didn't learn anything I didn't know: Just that simple,"Although Don peppers and Matha Rogers are good speakers, the books are beginning to sound repetitive. Basically, how many times can you say the same thing. They must learn how to broaden their minds like the ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" and ""Dummies"" books"
1,Not the one!!!!,This is the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever used. Wow! It's super bad- the cord won't even wrap up properly- I just about cry every time I use it. I'm not even going to waste my time returning it. I will throw it in the trash!If you're looking for a vacuum- your search is not over!
4,Does the job,"The vacuum works well for what it's intended need is. If you have animals that shed, you will have to take out the filter every other time to clean off the hair and fur as it gets trapped."
1,"Cheaply made, ineffective","I only have four small carpeted rooms, so I thought this would be good enough for my purposes. It was not. It had a lot of suction power, but it did not last enough to vacuum a small 14x 16 bedroom because of the small filter. Additionally the hose broke off. This machine was treated very gently, and now it is completely broken. The other reviews said that it blows air out of the front, and boy, they're not kidding. I think the blower out the front was more powerful than the suction. It absolutely will not pick anything up off of a hard wood floor or a textured indoor/outdoor rug."
1,Damaged upon delivery,I would love to review this item but it came damaged and I am still awaiting the part (dust cap) from Eureka which is backordered. It's been sitting in my basement waiting for the part for almost two months now!
2,"Seems to work well, but almost impossible to assemble","My wife got the house and the Dyson, so I needed a vacuum for my new apartment. The Eureka 4700 seemed right.The problem: assembly required. For a vacuum?!?The worse problem: it's damn near impossible to assemble.The first step requires inserting a long screw to put part of the upright assembly on the base. The plastic part to attach would not accept the screw. I am 6'4 and 200 pounds. I had to put all of my strength and weight Into it to get this done.A later step rewires you to insert two small screws into vertical canals to affix the part. The canals were too small for the very common multiple screw head driver I use. I had to buy a skinny Phillips head screwdriver to do this step.This is ridiculous. A vacuum cleaner should not require assembly. If it does, assembly should be effortless.Don't buy this product."
1,Unhappily in search again of a vacuum,"Very unhappy with this item and when I wrote to the seller, I found they weren't willing to back up their product with too much customer care. It stopped working within 3times of use. The suction was very low and it started to smell like it was burning. The belt was still working but the motor was getting hot. So I am again in search...."
4,The Best Vacuum I've Purchased!,"I love this vacuum. I have a dirt devil vacuum, which keeps losing suction. It is currently in the repair shop. The Eureka 4700A has a washable filter, which I love. No more buying high-priced filters. It picks up dirt, dog hair, etc. It has a light, which shines bright for night time vacuuming. The auto height adjuster is great. It vacuums on carpet and floors. The only thing about this vacuum I don't like is that it doesn't have enough on-board tools for other cleaning jobs around the house. I will use some of my tools, which came with my dirt devil vacuum for other cleaning jobs. It really deep cleans and makes the carpet look like new. I would purchase this vacuum cleaner instead of a dirt devil. In the past, I have owned several vacuums, from several name brand companies, and this is the best by far. Good purchase. No taxes, shipping and it is shipped directly to the purchaser. One stop shopping, can't beat that."
4,Good vacuum,Good vacuum for the price. Love the bagless feature and yellow is my favorite color. Seems to be a bit louder than my previous vacuum however.
2,zippy,"zippy, light, and powerful but the exhaust blows out the front so yes its hard to use on hardwood floors but if all ya goot is carpet or rugs ...its great!"
3,Great for carpets ONLY!,"I bought this at a wal-mart at the same price. I really like this vacuum cleaner on my carpeted section of the house but when I got to the bare floor I notice that I shoots all the dirt out the back onto your feet. I guess it's too powerful for bare floors. Not to mention that when it's on it blows air at the same time so dust bunnies and pieces of trash fly off around you. It was pretty frustrating during the rainy season when you get dirt and mud tracked into your home and you try to vacuum it up with this one... you get mud shot everywhere else. Like I said, this is great for carpets and the attachments are neat and work great in furniture crevices and blinds. It is very powerful and picks everything out of the carpets and leaves the thick ones all fluffy! Plus it is bagless so that is a big saver on buying bags. So if you don't have ANY bare floors...buy it!"
2,Very cheaply made...,"I had read a lot of positive reviews and since my Dyson stopped working due to waterlog, I had to get another vacuum PDQ. Unfortunately, it was so cheaply made that everytime I moved it, it just fell apart. So, I bought another refurbished Dyson, and I'll be sure not to use it around water."
5,Great for the Price!,Bought this for my mom and she loves it. It works amazing as long as you keep it clean.
1,Biggest POS ever.,"This thing doesn't vaacum at all. It evenly moves any dirt and dust trough your house and thats about it. Its as noisy as a jet, heavy and totally useless. My husband had to buy it cause it looked cool or whatever but he simply bought the worst piece of crap ever made... I loathe vaacuming our apartment because it only means I'll hurt my toes trying to move this tank trough our apartment, cause my cat to panic and poop all over the floor and in the end its still dirty. Great, thanks for making us waste [...]$ Eureka! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
2,Only For Small Jobs,"I purchased this product in 2009 from Kmart and, within the first year, I replaced the agitator roller because the other one literally melted! This vacuum does not handle carpet well. Even short pieces of hair get stuck in the sides of the roller and burn with a lovely smell that never leaves your house. I've tried raising the height, but then it doesn't pick up anything at all! I never had these problems with previous models from other companies. If you only do small jobs on thin rugs and need to use the hose for tight areas, then it's fine. Otherwise, you're asking for trouble."
5,Happy Happy,A little tough to put together but all in all works like a charm. Really Sucks dirt and does it well. I would buy it again. Easy to get rid of nasty dirt in the canister.
1,Junk don't waste your time and money,"The belt broke after the machine was used twice. I ordered new belts and filters, at a cost of another $50, but the brushroll still won't turn and the belt began to smoke. This vacuum is crap. I'm returning the belts and filters, and the vacuum too, and I'll buy some other brand. I don't know how Eureka stays in business selling this junk."
4,Works great,"I, too, had problems initially with the vacuum hose coming out of the base of the unit. However, for whatever reason, it no longer comes out during use. I have never had the listed problem of the vacuum overheating and shutting down. Admittedly I have only one room with carpet, the remainder is hardwood or tile so the machine may not get the use that someone with five carpeted bedrooms would give it.What I do have is a machine that outperforms every other vacuum I have ever owned including other Eureka models. The vacuum canister can be difficult to reinstall and that is what has kept me from giving it five stars. No bags, no fuss, no more dirt on my floors. I would buy it again!"
2,Disposable Vacuums,"Eureka used to sell a quality product, but the last two (including this model) are poor products. The first few times you use the vacuum, you will be impressed at how much suction they have. After that, it is all downhill. You will find yourself constantly cleaning filters, buying filters and performing maintenance to keep the level of suction that you had when you first purchased. Spend the money upfront and get a better vacuum from a better manufacturer."
4,Better than the last vacuum I owned.,"My husband brought this one home after our Infinity went belly up. I am constantly amazed at how much dust and pet hair comes off our carpet with this vacuum. I don't mind having to keep the filter clean, but it's true, you should wash it out after every use. The only complaints I have is the cord is a bit short, and it simply will NOT pick up kitty litter. It acts like it has sucked it up, but when I turn the vacuum off, there is invariably a little pile of kitty litter underneath the vacuum. I then have to get our antique Mighty Mite out and finish off the pile of litter."
4,Happy with this vacuum,"It's been three years since we have this vacuum so needless to say, it's been good to us. We have both hardwood and carpet and it's done a great job cleaning both. It picks up dirt and doggie hair on our carpet and we use it to clean up the dust bunnies on our hardwood floor before we swift it to buff/shine. The attachments are so readily available, it helps cleaning a breeze: we use the brush attachments to go around the quarter rounds edges on our house or on over our upholstery. Quite happy that this vacuum has lasted so long. We wash the filter once a year and so great that we don't have to deal with a bag. Great vacuum that has lasted us through the years!"
2,Smells Like Burning Rubber,"We bought this vacuum last year. The suction was powerful and the vacuum was very light. The hose kept on dislodging itself, which was annoying but fixable with a bit of teflon. Band burned through shortly. Last week it started to smell like burning rubber again. Checked the band, everything was fine. Noticed that the little plastic part that held the roller brush was melted. One the other side of the roller (the one held by the belt), the metal pin that is supposed to be in the middle of the rod was off-center, which I figure was the culprit of the struggle to rotate. Will now have to order a roller for $21. I'm sure this company makes its money on parts.."
5,Excellent experience,Thank you!!! I was looking for this so hard. I'm looking forward to do it again!!!
1,EXTREME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow, at first I thought it boring but then it was awsome!Iwas so exited about the new weapens I just beat omega without even notcen.oh, and it's like......AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!well, to bad you don't have a hook shot...oh well it's still good anyways,I don't want to spoil it!"
2,Enough Already,"This is just another book that draws on Nickeledoen and other kids TV for its inspiration. It can be funny but this style of book is feeling so much like watching TV, I'd like to turn it off. Joe's Wish was very charming and had a nice message but this comic book is just a waste of time. This is not a children's book in its truest sense. Mr. Proiimos, please go bck to the Loudness of Sam and your special gift of creating children's literature that does not imitate TV."
4,Good for a Tribute Album . . .,"There is nothing really surprising about this album. Most of the bands on this tribute to (the great) Venom are fabulous. Such as Kreator, Anathema, and Vio-Vod. Their renditions are great. They really capture the essence of Venom. But on the other hand, bands like Messiah/Candlemass and Skyclad destroyed true classics. The two unreleased Venom tracks are pure genius. The remix just plain out rocks. Most tribute albums are not essential, but this album is worth at least checking out. Especially if you are an Anathema and/or Kreator fan (which I am proud to say that I am). But watch out for the two tracks I mentioned earlier, beacuse, well. Just trust me, they suck...-MC"
4,"nice, but not the same","The knives are nice, but not the same shape as the steak knives that I purchased from Oneida many years ago. The blade end is wider and not as graceful looking."
4,One of Her Best even Read Today.,"Though the book was written almost a decade ago, you won't feel like reading an old story. The plot was full of twists and surprises as well as adventures making the book full, not lopsided to sole romance. I also like the inclusion of the story about Janellen and Bowie. It made the storyline rich and ever more pleasant. The only thing that kept me from giving the book a full mark was Lara's reason for not telling the truth about the scandal. I understand she had a lot of integrity, but the explanation was so unconvincing."
4,Smokescreen,"I think Okie Doke's review is right on the money, although the dirt wasn't shoveled up till the last chapter. Could there exist such a doormat as Lara? She truly needed saving. The bad guys are never quite as bad as their reputations and the good guys certainly were not."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this earbud looking for comfort and a good microphone, but didn't really receive either.The FlexiLoop was the best part of the product, it was comfortable and stayed in place, but trying to talk into the microphone located on the cord became uncomfortable. The person I was on the phone with could barley hear me. In all, this earbud looks like a cheap toy. Don't waste your money."
1,Save your money,"I create my own soaps, creams and lotions from scratch using quality ingredients. I currently do not have a source of information on lotions and such and thought this ebook might help further my skills. It did not and because its an electronic book I can't return it. In my opionion this book is not good for even a serious hobbiest! It uses pre made bases or products (Suave shampoo) that you just add a few things to and call it good. Not good enough for me and not worth $10. If you are looking for the most elementary information then this might be for you."
3,SMALLER SIZES ARE AVAILABLE!!,"Most websites have only the 9' and longer sizes shown as available. This is erroneous! Sizes as small as 3' long are made. I didn't know this until receipt of the product bought, and the package was opened. My need is the 3' length, not 9'! So now I'm stuck with a product I don't need, and have to buy direct from the mfr. to get the size I really need. This is a great dis-service to we consumers."
1,failed and pipes froze,"The product worked for one winter, this winter we plugged it in, lights came on and no heat so the pipes froze up. A nasty expense and trouble. We won't use this brand again or tell anyone to use it."
3,beware re stocking fee,I was confused by the description and ordered the wrong item. My bad...I did not know there was a restocking fee if returned. I assumed since it was Amazon I did'nt have to worry about that. Nowhere did it say there was a restocking fee. By the time I paid shipping it was hardly worth the trouble... It was totally my error. Next time I will be more careful where it is coming from.
2,Trouble,"The original trouble game is much better, then this one. The popper was very hard to use for the little hands playing the game. They would have to hit the popper as they were punching something."
4,"broad, sweeping melodies","I had to listen to this a couple of times, but I'm hooked now. All of its accessible and some of it quite engaging. Not a new sound, but refreshingly different than the NY garage revival stuff that's so popular. It's part electronic and part singer-songwriter style. At their best on ""Only So Long"", its what Jeff Buckley might have sounded like had he been part of Death Cab for Cutie. Also similar to For Stars."
3,"Okay, but no cigar",This was an easy and fun read. But just because you are planning a sequel does not mean you have to stiff the reader with no ending. This is not a way to sell future books. Also the story line was all over the place. A good book to borrow but not to buy.
1,A waste of your money,"I just bought this machine and hoped it would be a great investment. However, it was such a terible mistake and waste of money. Puting all pieces toghether took me almost one day. That complex and ridiculous it was. After I finally got it all up and running, I was shocked how noisy the machine was. If you go to a speed higher than 2 MPH, you might need ear pluggs. The hydraulics( however they call them) and the running belts make a terrible sound. Everything looks like it will fall apart and not last for very long. What a waste of money and time! I will return it as soon as possible."
5,Unpredictable thriller!,"Nancy Mehl is heartless when it comes to murdering characters, but she sure keeps you guessing while reading her mysteries. Just when you think you have this book figured out and think you know where it's going, you get thrown for a loop with another shocking murder and all your theories get tossed out the window.Icy Curtis is a completely believable heroine, even while she's figuring out clues before the cops. Her self-deprecating humor is delightful, and her emotional struggles bond her to readers because they're pretty much the same things we all go through. I'm so glad her adorably crusty new buddy, Det. Milt Barbarino, is determined to keep her involved in crime solving so I'll get to read more of her adventures, and I can't wait for the next one!"
1,Eureka Altima- High Yellow,I agree with all the one stars. It started out great but now it does not want to pick up anything. We have replaced the belt and cleaned the filters and also unclogged them. I was in denial at first but now I looking to purchase another after buying this one in January 2007. It may have lasted 6 months
2,Shoots Stuff back at Your Feet,"So do not buy this model, its a waste, the ""vacuum"" simply shoots stuff back at you... Its awful, and very frustrating. I feel like calling the manufacture but its a waste of time because it will be hell to get any decent service. Do not spend money on this."
1,Worked great for 2 weeks.,"I bought this vacuum at target in April, and for the first few weeks it worked great, except for the attachments which never worked at all. It has continually gone downhill to the point that I am ready to just throw it out. It doesn't pick up anything, and Ive kept it up exactly to the manuals instructions. The inner filters need to be washed out every other week, and the hepa filter needs to be replaced after 6 months, but it didn't even last that long. All it does now is spit the dust back out and create these disgusting hairballs. Don't waste your money."
1,Total Piece of Crap,"We've had this vacuum for some time and let me tell you - it totally sucks. For every 1 hour vacuuming, we have to spend 4 hours troubleshooting it, trying to figure out why it's not working. We're pretty technical handy people, but we cannot figure out how to keep this thing happy. It's super-finicky and just stops working frequently.To top that off, the accessories have a habit of jettisoning off while vacuuming, so we spend quite a bit of time picking up the bar, putting it back on, plugging the dust wand back in, etc. It's exhausting trying to use this.We contacted Eureka Customer Service via their web site and have yet to hear a response. We're very disappointed and would give this no stars if it were possible. Needless to say, we won't be buying a Eureka again. Had they returned our inquiry and at least offered some assistance, we would have been amicable to them as a company.Terrible Product + Bad Customer Service = Eureka Altima!"
1,Don't buy it!,"I loved this vacuum for three months. It picked up pet hair dander and dust better than most. I babied the machine, cleaned out the dust container mid use and washed the filters and dust cup after each use. Then it happened, a loud noise a small amount of smoke and the belt had snapped, the brush mount melted and the housing destroyed (from the melted brush mount). Eureka representatives said the part that failed was not under warranty and has refused to replace or repair my relatively new vaccum. They even said it was my fault for not keeping it at a high enough setting for my carpet (I keep it on the highest setting). It would have cost me more to repair than replace the machine. I have had great luck with Eureka products in the past but with their response (or lack thereof) I will not buy a Eureka again. Do yourself a favor and don't buy a Eureka Altima."
1,dont waste your money!...,"i had this for 2 weeks, called the company because the dirt kept getting caught in the top filter. they had me readjust the carpet height..it only worked on one height. i called again in 2 weeks as i had changed the belt and it was still smelling like somethign was burning. it was clogged, but i got the clog out. still wasnt working right. today i had to call again (2 weeks after last call...6 weeks after i bought it). the vacuum was smoking! the roller actually melted!!! they told me it was my fault as the height adjustment was probably wrong..even though i told them there was only one height i could use it on. so now im out the money i spent on this and out a vacuum! dont waste your money on any eureka. oh they said warranty wouldnt cover it as it was the roller..and that im at fault????"
1,Awful Vacuum-Don't Buy Eureka,"My wife and I bought this vacuum about a year ago because the previous one we had (which lasted over 5 years) finally died. Well, the first month or so, it worked fine. I won't say that it worked well, because it still was not as good as our last vacuum. Then, suddenly, it was awful. It would clog in three different places, the belt would slip continuously, it would hardly pick anything up at all, and like you heard from others, it actually shot/threw things back out, making our carpet worse than before!All I can say is DO NOT BUY EUREKA! Ever! I read reviews for two of their other models and observed the same response. The company will NOT do anything to rectify this situation. Apparently, this model (and the others with the poor reviews) were never tested. They were simply put out on the market to use the brand name to make money.I hope they go out of business for the awful product(s) and nonexistant customer service."
1,Quit working for me,"Great when I bought it. Very heavy though. About 3 weeks after I bought it, the brush underneath quit turning when I was vacuuming. checked everything, tried everything. spins fine if I tilt it back and not let it touch the floor but when I put it on the carpet it quits turning and the motor overheats and it even began smoking the last time I used it. It's going back to Wallyworld asap. Wish I had better news."
1,Don't Buy Eureka Altima,"This is the worst vaccum i have ever had. First of all, the top filter needs cleaning after almost every use. Secondly, dust chokes the dust tunnel every now and then, needs cleaning. Now the roller has stopped spinning , on examining it, i found, the plastic edges had melted, causing a tilt and now it gets stuck reducing the suction and fumes because of friction between belt and pulley.I use it not more than once a month and this is what i have had to put up with since the beginning.I won't suggest anyone to buy this product."
5,Surprising,"I was surprised by this vacuum. For $80 it performs at least as well as as units costing twice the price. Some reviews commented about the accessories falling off as well as the filter covers. This hasn't been a problem for me - everything stays where it belongs. The suction is great and the ""power paw"" is a great feature. It grabs cat hair from the furniture quicker than a piece of tape! I got the yellow one from Wal-Mart and am more than just pleased - I am very happy. Okay, okay, the yellow/black combination appeals to my senses - same color as my DeWalt tools!"
1,useless,"truly awful - filter clogs almost immediately, belt broke after about 30 minutes of use. amazon should introduce zero star rating just for this item."
3,WRONG COLOR,the box came quick and was up in an hour but the wrong color. out where i live you can not just return to amazon without a lot of hassle.
5,Nice Watch,A great buy for the money. Well built and looks great. Keeps better time than my Rolex.....
3,Eurkea 2904AZ Maxima Upright Vacuum,"A decent vacuum at a modest price. Does a decent job on my rugs -- it is basic but, for the price, cleans just fine."
3,"""goth"" you might say","There is indeed goth rock on here, but there is also way too much industrial and Darkwave.... It is a decent c.d. but not exactly good. There could have been some really good older bands on it instead of really bad over redundant industrial/ebm/darkwave.I don't really recomend this cd unless you like industrial. Industrial is nothing like goth or goth rock, and I wish compilations would just do one or the other."
5,Brings back memories from the 80's,"I remember watching this show every Thursday night and laughing hysterically most of the time. Even after all these years, these DVD's made me laugh all over again. One thing that is great about these as opposed to seeing them on tv (even though they aren't rerunning this show right now), is that you get the entire show. Some of the scenes are deleted for commercial purposes when they air. Waiting for the final 2 seasons to complete my collection."
4,A bit of fun!,"""The Giant Rat of Sumatra"" is a delightful little book suitable for a quick dose of Holmes. Why not have some fun with the concept of Doyle's ""lost"" manuscripts? I found the author's treatment of this idea entertaining and thought provoking. The presentation of Holmes' brother is particularly refreshing and I was amused by his assistance to Holmes throughout the tale.It would be a mistake to approach this clever little adventure with a Holmesian purist's zeal looking to pounce on any perceived lack of faithfulness to the originals; I say relax and enjoy a timely tale of hatred of civilization with authentic renderings of some of our most beloved companions.The attractive cover matches the exotic sense of adventure suggested in the title, while the subdued ""period"" illustrations appropriately punctuate and supplement the text.As a gift from a friend, it was a fine companion for a short bit of post-holiday relaxation by the fire."
1,TERRIBLE !!!,"Be warned that this is NOT a downtempo compilation!!!Moby's ""Porcelain"", starting the first cd, is good,the rest of the album REALLY bad.The album is filled with stuff OTHER than ""chillout"",new-agey tunes, jazzy tunes, at least three boring relaxationmusic tunes with little birdies chirping in the forest, lots ofelevator music, and even a really unnerving, edgy techno tune,starting the second cd!DON'T buy it: you'd regret it!"
3,It's OK,"This vaccuum was rated very well by Consumer Reposrts, so I purchased it. It is very powerful, and has attachments, but here's the downside: The hose has an extention pipe for reaching high or narrow places. But, the attachment nozzles, like the crevice tool, don't fit on the end of the extension pipe! How stupid is that?! Neither does the ""stair claw."" Also, the vaccuum is HEAVY and hard to control. It is much better than the old ""Hoover Soft and Light"" I had before in terms of power, but it's not all it's cracked up to be. I guess if you want a vaccuum that will certainly pick up the dirt, it's for you. I am sadly not as impressed as I expected to be for $150.00"
1,hate it,"I was leery about buying an upright since I had had a canister for 17 years but since it was an Eureka I thought the upright should be just as good, boy was I wrong. Unless you have a shag carpet(who does?) this vacuum hardly picks up anything, it's terrible on bare floors. The extension hose for the brush is way too short, it doesn't fit under any furniture and doesn't get close enough to the edges. Horrible!"
5,Great Vacuum,this is our third vacuum and love it. It is a little difficult to engage with the foot - but besides that it is great - picks up everything - very strong. Highly recommend.
2,Tough to push,This vacuum has good pick-up power but it so difficult to push; has no options for self propelled. It is also hard to release the pedal; it is not for the average gal to push around. I would not recommend this vacuum.
1,Not as good as they hype...,"Bought this vacuum after reading all of the wonderful reviews from consumers and magazines. This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned. My Dirt Devil which was less than half the price did a much better job. Even on my thin plush carpet, I have to put height on the highest setting in order for the brushes to rotate. I also have to go over things over and over again for it to pick up the dirt. My cleaning people have also expressed frustration using it. Save your $$ and go with another brand! This has been nothing but a disappointment."
1,I sent it back. I couldn't move the handle!,"We got this machine and the handle wouldn't budge unless you practically stood on the release button. We tried everything but it was like moving a truck, and it was so heavy I knew it would kill me if I had to use it everyday. We finally sent it back to Amazon and I am glad it is out of my home.We bought an Electrolux canister from Costco and it is light and easy to use. Now I'm happy again."
2,Not worthy the money,"I was pretty happy about this vacuum during my first time of using it, it has pretty good suction power. I gave it 4 stars for my first review. But the problem occurred only a few minutes into the use for the second time, the brush stopped rolling. I noticed that there was no suction power. I brought it to the nearby warranty station, and it was found out that the belt was broken. it has been only used once for normal in-house cleaning and I neither saw anything unusual got caught nor heard any noise during the cleaning. The service guy told me that the belt is not the good type and unfortunately is not under warranty, to replace it I need to pay more than $40 and he is not sure how long the new belt will last or if any other problems will happen as he has no confidence in this model at all. He also mentioned that Consumer Report doesn't know what they are doing when ranking the vacuum cleaner."
4,Eureka 4870GZ,Very good at picking up dirt on carpet and tile. Only negatives are the foot release leaver to hard to release and the hose is very short.
2,Short lived,"I bought the vacuum from Amazon last year. It only lasted a year for me and now the brush runs all the time, even on hard floors. The hose attachment broke up and I replaced it once and now it needs replaced again. I am looking for another vacuum."
4,Eureka 4870GZ worth the buy,Good suction. A little heavy. Don't like the release foot control; can't do it with bare feet and it feels like it will be the first thing to break. Otherwise GREAT vacuum. I would buy another one.
5,Pet hair power house!,"I have had this vacuum for about a year and it has worked wonderfully! I had the previous model as well for about 4 years and it too was a great vacuum.I work my vacuums to death! In my home, we have 3 large dogs, 4 guinea pigs, 2 mice, 1 cat and twin 8 year old kids. We also have dark green carpet that shows EVERYTHING that touches it. This vacuum does such a good job, after I have cleaned, my carpet looks like it has just been shampooed. It works as well today as it did the day I bought it.If you need a vacuum that works great for pet hair, this is the one!"
3,Heavy and Not good on bare floors,"It works well on carpeting, but if you have both hardwoods and carpet- you really need to purchase a second machine. On the hardwood it is really loud and does not pick up well."
2,Might be great- I don't know!,"Bought it brand-new and the beater brush never worked right. It would stall out and stop spinning no matter what I did to make it work. Tech support gave me two options- take it to their service center about 25 miles away or take it back for another one where I bought it. Neither option was acceptable to me. I didn't buy a brand-new cleaner just to stop what I am doing, burn a few gallons of gas and stand in line at returns just to buy another one. Seems like these things should work right when you buy them."
1,Very dissatisfied,"I researched the heck out of this purchase and I believed Consumer Reports when they recommended this one -- I just don't get it. It has been terrible for us. Makes a horribly loud roaring noise; passes right over dirt and fuzz without picking it up, yet somehow sucked up and damaged the carpet where the carpet met the hard floor; it won't stay in the hard floors setting when we want it to; the attachments won't stay snapped into their storage positions... I hate this vacuum and I'm so annoyed I bought it."
3,Good product,"I purchased this product after reading positive reviews from it here and at Consumer Reports. Overall, I'm happy with the vacuum. However, I am concerned that it might not last long because so much of it is made of plastic. The lever to adjust the handle height is very stiff and I'm afraid I will break the whole machine when I step on it. Likewise, the lever to change from carpet to bare surface requires quite a bit of force to lock in place and this too is a plastic piece. Also, do not like how the wheels leave track marks on my new carpet -- I guess this is because of the weight of the machine. The vacuum is very powerful and does do a great job of cleaning, much better than my old Eureka. I will say that the customer service is excellent. Called them for information that wasn't clear in the directions provided and was pleasantly surprised with the assistance I received."
5,Great Vacuum,"I have enjoyed the quality of the cleaning power of this vacuum. The floor/carpet switch is hard to get used to. The ""claw"" attachment with its separate brush roller is great for small places and upholstery. The only real problem I have had is finding bags and parts in my area. Had to order directly from manufacturer who has a subscription deal which is fairly priced."
5,Something to hold onto!,"Please don't tell anybody----- my last vacuum cleaner cost me more than $1,500.00! I recently purchased the Eureka Boss model 4807G at a fraction of the cost of my original vacuum (the name shall not be mentioned, to protect the guilty.)I purchased the Eureka thinking I would use it as a backup only to discover it is more fun to use and does a better job. Since purchasing it , my daughter's sensitivity to pollens has diminished (I believe this is due to its Hepa filtration system.) I also like the handle - it is ergonomically shaped to hold more easily.If you are looking for a vacuum that looks good, sounds good, cleans good and just feels good; (while saving money) this Boss is for you!Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com"
5,Best Vacuum I've ever owned.,"This Vacuum has unbelieveable pickup power. The extra attachments are great, and they attach right on the vacuum, so you don't have to store them elsewhere. A little loud, but not enough to bother you while cleaning. I would definetly purchase this vacuum again! This was ""Consumer Reports"" second highest rated vacuum, this one is better priced than the first."
1,Falls Apart and Heavy,I've had this vacuum for 2 years and I've hated every minute of it. It's just so heavy that it's difficult to manage the stairs. It also needs to be kept in an 'open' position while struggling w/the stairs or else the beater brush doesn't engage and all you get is suction. That's not satisfactory for carpeted stairs. The extra atatchments break easily and are worthless. It does a decent job on carpeting but on hardwood I needed to use the hose. The hose split after 1yr and I had to duct tape it. The lever to release the handle so it can lay flat broke after 18months. It's not well made. I had to buy bags on line because they're hard to find.
1,Lasted about 3 months--with little use,"The pivot pedal permanently jammed, and even after replacing the bag, all it does is blow OUT dirt and dust."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FAULTY PRODUCT,"This thing worked great for about 2 weeks, since then I've replaced the belt 9 times in less than 1 year. Eureka does not stand behind their product and will not give you your money back. The repair man they send you to says ""this is the worst vacuum I've seen in 40 years of being a dealer, I stopped carrying it"" then he says ""see you next month"" because he knows I'll be back. Flat out told me it was a design flaw. The service people at Eureka are the worst too. I can't believe consumer reports rated this anything but JUNK!!!!"
2,Not all that great.,"We bought the Smart Boss because Consumer Reports rated it very high. I am very disappointed in how easy it is to use. The vacuum cleaner is very big, heavy, and hard to maneuver. The pedal to release the top portion, or handle is very hard to use. It takes a lot of strength to push the pedal down enough to release it. I also find it very difficult to go from the carpet mode to the floor mode. In order to change modes, you have to push a lever that moves the brush for the different modes. This lever is very difficult to push. It takes both of my hands to push hard enough to move the brushes. I think it is sufficient in how powerful the unit is, but since I find it difficult to maneuver, I do not use it that much."
4,Good vacuum for the price,Overall I am very pleased with this vacuum. The suction is so much better than my old Hoover. I have two little dogs that shed constantly and this vacuum picks up their pet hair with one swipe. It also fluffed up the nap in my carpet so that it looks almost like new. I do wish the Power Paw had a storage location on the vacuum. That is really the only thing negative that I can say. I don't think I could have gotten a better vacuum for the price. It does the job that I expected it to do and it does it very well.
2,Eureka Boss upright,"I ordered this product after reading many reviews about how well it worked and how quiet it was. I am very disappointed with the fact that it is extremely loud. Although it does a good job cleaning my white carpeting, the motor is so noisy that you need earplugs to use it!"
2,Very Disappointing,I'm on my FOURTH belt and I've used it less than 15 times. Suction was almost non-existent on high carpet setting. This vacuum is almost completely covered in dust as it spits out dust occassionally. If this is a top rated vacuum I'd hate to see an average one.
4,None,"Usual good Eureka product. But, prefer not to be asked to review things I order at Amazon. Thanks."
3,Not too user friendly........,I bought this vacuum and the suction is really not too bad. The problem is that I have to really use a lot of pressure on the button to lower the handle when you first start it and I am by no means a weak person. Maybe I just got a bad apple but I'm sure there are better ones out there.
1,Falling Apart,"Three month is all this thing lasted yes it does have very good suction and the brush does very good but it started sounding like it was over the hill after a week then the lever that opens the bag compartment broke while opening it and shortly after that the lower tool holder and part of the power cord and hose holder sheared off, but it still sucks. Yes it is very heavy and the light is worthless. It is not worth it pay a little more and get something that will last."
4,Very Pleased,"I think the only bad thing I have to say about this vacuum is that it is a little heavy for a person who would be out of shape. I'm 34 and in pretty good shape. I have used it on wood floors and carpet and the suction is wonderful. My carpet is really a disgrace, but we can't afford to replace it. This vacuum allows me to feel better about my kids playing on our carpet. I've also use the little attachment for the stairs. It is great! I hope this review is helpful to you. I know after reading other reviews on Amazon it helped me to decide to go with this one."
4,Wonderful vacuum,"Historically I go through one vacuum a year. Between the cat hair and my curly hair, the poor vacuums never stand a chance...but this one is different. Granted I havent had it for a year, in fact its only been a couple of months but, this is without a doubt, the best vacuum that I have bought. The suction is amazing!!! It cleans the cat hair off of the carpet, and the furniture. The appliances work really well too.The cons- Its heavy. Its not easy to push and its hard to bring up the steps. But I am still thrilled with it."
3,it in the details...belt hard to replace,Appears to be a good vacuum -- bought it a few weeks ago -- only took my 14 year old one attempt to vacuum for him to break the belt -- wasn't too concerned about it until I realized that the belt is not one of the sizes routinely sold by supermarkets or hardware stores. So now its a project to replace the belt. But if that is not a concern for you -- don't buy it at Amazon -- in my search for a belt found this vacuum for $109 at Kmart. UGH!
2,Brush Roll Problems,"I, like a lot of other reviewers out there, bought this vacuum on the advice of Consumer Reports. They had it listed as their ""best buy."" They definitely messed up on this one.I have experienced a substantial amount of belt slippage on my vacuum. In my opinion, it is just bad design. There are no gears on the belt. It is a smooth belt turned by a smooth motor shaft. No wonder it slips.I ended up taking my vacuum into a service center to assist me with replacing the belt. I was not encouraged by his comment that ""that thing is a piece of junk."" He thought I would get two years out of it, tops. He says that he does a lot of brush roll replacements on them because the design of it allows pet hair to become trapped in the ends of the brush roll.I have come to learn that if you want a good vacuum, you need to spend $300 or more. I think I will consult with a different source than Consumer Reports on my next vacuum purchase, too."
2,Eureka Company not very helpful,I purchased this vacuum and it had the wrong hose attachment on it. Now hardly 5 weeks later the belt has broken and the brush won't stop rotating with a new belt. I have had to take it in for repairs which is a 95 mile round trip and will have to return to pick it up. The company was not willing to admit that the machine was defective from the time I bought it. I won't buy another Eureka.
4,Pulled up lots of dirt and hair,"I had been using a Dirt Devil Canister for a few years and its wire frayed so I was scared of getting shock therapy so I look at the Consumer Reports and other peoples reviews of the top two and I bought this one. I used it for the first time just now and it pulled up so much dog hair and what I can only imagine is dead skin cells that I can't believe it. I filled the bag up in about 500sqft. I vacuumed weekly with the other one and it was time to vacuum but still I was freaked out. The carpet feels better to walk on and it left the pile looking nice. If you get this make sure you have a set of Phillips Heads screw drivers. I luckily found my set because it takes just the right one to screw in those three screws. I'm horrible at putting stuff together, like really bad, but I get this together in no time. It is just a matter of screwing the handle on. If this keeps working as well as it did on the fist try I'll like it."
5,"Affordable, easy to use, We love it.","After reading lots of reviews, this seemed like a good choice. After using it a month . . .. . it was a great choice. I love having the hose travel around with the machine, its not too heavy, and if you push the release lever with your heal instead of your toe it is easy to release . . . I'd recommend this to my mother its so good"
4,This Vacuum Really SUCKS!! :),"I love my new Eureka Boss! It has great suction power. I like the onboard attachments and the suction is just as strong when you are using the hose and attachments.There is a switch that you flip to turn the suction off of the floor part of the vacuum and on to the hose. It also can be set to sweep a bare floor. This vacuum has a light on the front and comes with a stair cleaning attachment. It has a really long cord.The only down side to this vacuum is that it is heavy.I originally bought a much more expensive vacuum, but returned it and like this vacuum MUCH better."
1,Burned Out in a Year,"This vacuum didn't last at all. Granted, I have a dog that sheds (don't we all?) a lot of the year. These lower end vacuums just don't hold up to heavy vacuuming. That being said, this vacuum was at the dump in just under a year - another throw away. This would be great for people who don't have pets that shed or kids that track in everything under the sun."
1,Worst Vacuum ever!,"We bought this vacuum on the strength of its reviews here and in Comsumer Reports. Everyone seemed to love it. However, we have had this vacuum less than 1 year and have already had to replace the belt 6 times!! We also had problems with the motor overheating. When it works, yes it does OK. Our problem with it is that it almost never is in working order! Junk! Don't go near it!"
2,Go with the Dyson Ball,"I bought this instrument after reading that it was a ""best buy"" as according to Consumer Reports. Well, this tool is extremely heavy, bulky, hard to maneuver, terrible on stairs, and chips cracks and wears out after only 2 years.We just invested in the Dyson Ball, and there is a night and day difference. The light weight ball is handy, agile, and convenient. The Eureka has moved in to the guest bedroom upstairs and will only come out on occasion, and maybe to clean out the fireplace. Sorry Eureka, the Dyson is a better product all around."
2,Low quality; gave out after few months,"I researched many vacuums including Consumer Reports, Good Housekeeping, and several web sites -- all came back to this vacuum. Price was right. However, the vacuum did not live up to expectations. Switching from carpet to bare rug difficult. Roller quit after few months. Bulky. The HEPA filtration blowing in front just blew all the dust/pet hair away from vacuum cleaner. Gave up using it after just few months and bought an Oreck."
3,Great but not so great,"Very powerful but also very heavy. the RR Bags cannot be found in any store locally, not even in wal-mart. The hepa filter cost is $20.00 and should be changed quite often. I would have never purchased this item if I knew then what I know now."
3,"works well, but very HEAVY","Great suction, cleans very well, but this vacuum is very big and very heavy. Since it is so big, it is hard to reach into smaller spaces in my apartment without using the attachments. But primarily I have trouble manipulating because it so very heavy and requires a lot of arm and wrist strength. From the reviews, I knew this vacuum would be heavy, but I got it anyway because I needed to replace a convenient light-weight vacuum that did not have good suction and easily overheated. After six months, this one still runs well and cleans very well. Another small design flaw is that the electrical cord extends from the machine strangely lower to the ground than in other upright vacuums. This means that you must hold the cord in one hand (so you don't run over it) while you push the heavy vacuum with your other hand."
5,Super cleaning,Cleans great and extensions are easy to use. It is quite heavy and so may no be the right cleaner for an older person.
4,Eureka 4870GZ,This vacuum works very well. Having two cats and a long haired dog makes an ability to pick up animal hair from carpet imperative. I was not disappointed. I purchased the GZ(Red) model instead of the newer HZ(Blue) because of a lower price and free shipping. This was a total saving of about $60. I would recommend it to anyone other than someone frail; it might be difficult for the elderly to handle.
5,Right Size - Excellent Product,"Already have a similar card holder, but a bit larger. Bought this one to have a slightly more manageable size - 3 cards height is just right for fitting into some of my drawers and easier to carry around. Liked the good quality leather and durable stitching. I am very satisfied with this product!"
2,item not properly described,"This item is intended to hold 60, not 120 cards.When I told the seller this, I was instructed to store the cards in a ""back to back"" fashion, as if this workaround adequately forgives them for advertising this product as a 120-card holder and not a 60-card holder, which it most certainly is.This may not have been such a big deal if this was outlined in the product description. But it is not.When I meet someone and we exchange cards, I write a little something on the back of their card to help me better remember the context in which I met the individual. Using this ""back-to-back"" method makes my practice less helpful if I have to yank every card out to find that one guy I met at that certain meeting where we discussed such and such.The construction of the product is decent and the leather is genuine and of a suitable color and texture (mine is the brown).But remember, only order this if you intend to use it as a 60-card holder, NOT a 120-card holder."
2,not good,"it was one-sided. i wish it came with double-paged.the quality is not good. the leather is not good either, and the color comes off a little bit.i purchased two, one of which had smear on it.it doesn't seem to hold 120 cards as described.you can simply buy a much better one with the same price.don't be cheated by the previous reviews. i read the reviews to purchase this item, but i am simply disappointed.based on my personal experience, i know how they manage to get so many good reviews. i will never trust reviews on individual sellers on amazon. the way they operate it is cheating."
5,I really like it,"It's nice, the leather cover is soft and looks expensive. It's not too small or too big - simply perfect."
3,"Good card holder, but...","The card windows should be thicker, of a more sturdy material. The leather wallet needs to be thicker as well."
2,Hmmm.,"I can barely remember everything from this CD, since I haven't listened to it since I was like, 8. SEXO is a dumb song, though, I remember."
3,New sharpeners do not work as well,We have an older version of this Chantry sharpener that works much better than this one. The only thing I can think of is that the sharpening wheels in this one seem to have a layer of paint or something one them whereas the old on does not (and doesn't appear that it ever did). Perhaps the paint will wear off and it will work better but for now it is what it is.
1,On fire,Our toastmaster oven caught fire over the weekend. We were lucky that the toaster oven was the only casualty. Of course there was also the mess to clean up after the use of the fire extinguisher. It could have been disastrous. I think we only had the toaster oven for barely 6 months. I will not be buying this model again.
1,terrible toaster,toast will either burn or one must stand by watching to get it done properly & toasting takes long time - toasting 2 slices of bread could take 10 min. Had a toastmaster years ago & loved it so thats why I bought this thinking it would be as good as what I had before. Plan to get a pop up toaster even though I just got this in Dec. 2005. Have not had a good slice of toast since I got this contraption.
1,You get what you paid for,"About a month after I got this toaster oven (and just a few uses) the timer knob broke off. Since there is no off setting for the timer, the toaster is on continuously unless it's unplugged. It's a piece of junk and not worth the money."
1,disappointed,"i've had this item for almost 3 months.after having used toaster ovens for years, this one is a disappointment!i loved the roomy interior for baking [8x8 pan] but the toaster setting is stupid.no way to set it for muffins or bread.it's different each time. when setting timer half the numbers rubbbed right off and last night,turning the timer the dial came off! thank god, i was a girlscout and fixed it. the exterior really overheats. i feel this is too dangerous to have and am buying another one."
3,A bit weak.,This seems a bit weak after The King's Speech and a number of documentaries about George VI and Elizabeth. It was OK and well acted I suppose but Bertie didn't come across as well as I expected. Apparently both George and Elizabeth were very committed to service and encouraging Britain during WWII and beyond.
5,Deep Tissue Massage & Myofascial Release (A. Riggs).,"Exceptional. I highly recommend both the book and DVD set to all massage therapists, especially those who are convinced they know all the tricks of the trades. I appreciate the emphasis on techniques for using good body mechanics that prevent fatigue and injury to the M.T."
5,the good review,"I was glad to have found this CD. Um, I really can't say anything else other than that I needed it for something. I mean what do you want me to say? That I so grateful to have specifically bought it from Amazon.com. Perhaps you might want to hear that I needed it to complete my diabolical plans to take over the east coast....You see, there is no real reason to be specific about why I needed it. To put it simple, I just needed it and I am happy that I found it."
5,for my son,can hardly wait to give it to my son. it is ridiculous to have to write additional words to submit a review. UHG
3,What I ordered is not what I got,There was a different Kidsong video inside this package. The seller refunded my money though so it was ok and the kids still like the other one. Just a bit disappointing.
4,celebration of Iowa quilters,"I received this book for Christmas, it was on my wish list! It took me two nights to go through it. Each Chapter is about an Iowa Quilter or Quilt Group. This book makes you wish you could meet each of the women and men that were highlighted. My only disappointment with the book was that there were no pictures of the wonderful quilts that were described in each chapter. The photos came from the author's collection and that of an Iowa Museum. This book is a good book for anyone who enjoys quilt history."
1,The Worst Feminist Diatribe I Have Ever Read,"I was told this was 'the' book to read on this topci. Have never been so badly put wrong in my life. It was total rant, no arguments offered, the position was just stated without evidence or sources offered most of the time. The conclusions were jumped to by psycho-analysis into objectors' childhoods and prudish tendancies ""these people hate sex"" ""this entire class of people hate women"" all the while assuming without argument that anyone who likes sex and likes women will agree with her. If its feminist rant you want for the purposes of convincing other feminist ranters who don't would rather hear about their oponents women/sex hating tendencies than why their arguments are invalid then buy this you will love it. On the other hand if you want to engage in an academic arena and employ logic and arguments steer clear and don't waste your money."
1,it sucks. plain and simple,"i bought it as a gift. didnt even think of trying it out before i gave it to them as a christmas present. come to find out, it was broken. i took it back home to test it out. only one of the fret buttons, the start button and the whammy bar worked. nothing else. i havent gotten around to calling the company but its the first thing im doing when i get the chance. spend the money on getting an offical guitar through red octane. its worth spending the $40-$60 for the controller. at least you know that one wont break on you."
2,Boring! And egotistical.,I love reality programs but this one was the pits! Not only were the challenges dull but the B-grade and C-grade celebrities would battle over who had the biggest ego. The only thing stopping me from giving this a one-star is Kathy Griffin - the only redeeming feature in this celebrity snorefest.
2,Mean spirited & deceptive view of use of the Columbia River,Harden writes in a mean spirited tone about the people who rely on the Columbia River to make a living. He uses deception to make a case that the Columbia Basin Irrigation Project is impractical. He neglects to mention that the Project only uses 2% of the Columbia River and that 40 % of the world's food is raised with irrigation
3,Not Donleavy's Best,"After reading the Ginger Man and the entire Darcy Dancer trilogy, this novel is a sad disappointment of wearisome and sophomoric writing. Particularly unnerving is the slipshod shuttlecocking from third person to first person narration which begins on the first page.-Where was the bleeding editor!?!-There is also the pretentious Joycean reference to the last lines of Ulysses on p. 220:""No. I'm glad you said yes.""""Yes I said yes.""One wonders whom Donleavy was trying to impress here-those who had read the last page, or last line of Ulysses? Or was he just being careless and lazy? I very much fear the latter.I'm a great Donleavy fan. But this is not the book of the great writer that you want to read. The Ginger Man or any of the Darcy Dancer trilogy books display so much more lyricism and craft than this book that it almost seems as if it were by another writer entirely."
1,Be VERY careful with Hartz products,"Hartz products have been known to cause severe illness and even death in younger animals. I've been a veterinary technican for 16 years and have seen their products do some terrible things. If you can avoid using them, do so."
4,Good stuff - good price,"My wife bathes her little dogs often and alternates with three different ""flavors"" of shampoo from Hartz - this has a pleasant odor and seems to do it's job with regards to the fleas."
1,Evil corporations,"Dear hartz,I recently purchased your ""Flea shampoo"" as my dog has contracted fleas and I had no other way to ensure their cleanliness, to my amazement my dogs fleas have since passed away and I am not one but happy, your product has killed my dogs fleas and I shall await your response in order to arrange a form of compensation to deal with this recent bereavement."
2,A let down but worth adding to your library collection,With great anticipation I glanced through a copy of this two vol. tome.I believe only two libraries in all of Texas have purchased the book.The book gets mixed reviews. I believe its better than the outdatedJohnsgard. More time contacting regional biologist and going through the journals would have made the book better. Many species have information only as current as the late 1980s.I consider the book a required addition to anyone's library if one is serious about waterfowl (other than the species in the United States where the BNA series and the soon to be released Bellrose would be better) but suggest you wait a year and purchase a used copy. It simply is not worth the current price
2,Disappointing,"Had liked Konik's earlier book and so I was excited to read this one. It's slow, tedious, boring and not worth the price of admission. I am giving the book two stars because one or two of the articles were ""fair"" and even had a surprise or two buried among the hashed-over stories. If you know anything about gambling, you will not be surprised or enlightened by this volume, which seems to be rushed and even banged out. Let's hope Konik's next book is better."
4,Pretty Good,"I purchased the unit in Omaha, NE during a cross country trip. I have since used it on two other cross county trips and have not had any problems with reception. I am extremely sastisfied with the service. The only problem I find is that when travelling in large cities, e.g. Chicago, Washington D.C., etc... there is some interference from radio stations on the same frequency. Herein lies the problem, there are only four FM settings, so it can be a bit tricky to find a station with good reception. That is my only complaint. I recommend the service and this unit, I have enjoyed eight months of quality service."
2,This is System Dynamics called differently,Warren describes the application of System Dynamics to strategic enterprise policy development and calls it Resource Based View.
2,Terrible Support,"The product is reasonably good. Used it for several months, then refused to open PDF files.Support (even email support) costs $9.99. They have an online knowledge base, but it is realtively useless. I've never used commercial business software that doesn't at least have free email support, or a user message board to discuss problems. Very annoying."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I agree with S. Rua that we women need to enjoy life and not obsess over every detail of food, but did you really need this book to finally convince you of that ?I have to agree that walking, drinking water, watching what you eat and enjoying the experience of eating is good advice (who could disagree). But it being a ""new way"" of thinking and a means of APPRECIATING LIFE !...well I think you've gone a bit overboard.If it took this book to finally bring you to those conclusions, then I feel sorry for you. You've been missing out on a lot.And I agree with the man from California that you should exercise as well, avoid tobacco, find good quality food, and don't obsess over food.Personally, while I did enjoy reading parts of this book, in the end it's just another way to cash in on the diet craze in America."
4,French Like!,nicely written. the chapter are like stores and make its fun to read. in between the use of french words makes once curious to look for the meanings and they're very well said at places with the context.don't expect quick fix solutions as it is only a guide and what you should followup on daily basis to see an improvement.thanks.
3,Strange appeal,"Although the author appears to be condescending there was something about this book that made me want to look/act/eat more in the French style. (Not that there is anything wrong with American style.) I look at the book occasionally, which gives me the incentive to eat and dress well all the time although I'm in my sweats as I type this review."
5,A beautiful culinary memior,"I was drawn into this book within the first few pages, a rarity among any diet esque book. It brings out a sense of peace and harmony with the natural world that I never knew food could bring. (I am so moving to France) Guiliano shows all of us that there is no need to hate yourself for indulging in a piece of chocolate, or that creamy sauce, but that you only need to compensate for doing so. This book has turned a new leaf in my life, I am no longer as stressed out, I take more joy in preparing my meals (no longer called cooking in my house), I have only been doing this for a few days and I feel much better about myself and my life. This is a fabulous read and has valueable teachings all of America could use. Thank you so much Mireille!P.S.The Magical Leek Soup is very delicous!"
2,Good story but impractical,"While the basic advice of ""French Women Don't Get Fat"" is sound, many of the hints and tips are simply not feasible. I wish I had the time to shop four times a week at an open air market. I wish I had the spare income to exclusively buy heirloom and organic produce. Unfortunately, I live in a world that does not have room for backyard fruit trees and a nanny who tells adorable dinnertime stories to encourage children to eat healthy soup. Something tells me that the majority of American women live in the same world I do.The book has some cute anecdotes, interesting recipes, and a decent story. However, lots of the information does not fit well into a working family's weekly schedule. I'd be more interested in a book that focuses on implementing the author's ideas with a limited budget and limited time."
4,Not your typical diet book,"This is a very engaging read for anyone, regardless of physique. Lots of common sense advice presented in a very readable format. If you love quality food, you'll love this book."
1,I doubt French women would read this,"This book started off well, talking about French vs American culture, etc. (We're the neanderthals, they're perfect). And she talked about the high standards of French women and how they shop for their food at the markets every morning, etc. However, as the book goes on, she suggests that to lose weight you have to always be somewhat hungry, that French women never eat until satisfied, etc. Stay hungry if you want to be thin and beautiful. Anyway, it sounded miserable. And unrealistic."
4,misunderstood,"I feel that some people are taking this book too literally. This book, like any other diet book, is about changing some habits from unhealthy to healthy. And it promotes thinking about food in a different way, and using different ingredients than you normally would.I used to go to the farmers market every Saturday and buy loads of healthy food, and then let it all go to waste because I was either too lazy or uninspired to do anything with it.After reading this book I am planning my meals more, thinking about at least 3 different recipes I could use for one kind of fruit or vegetable when I buy them (to prevent waste), and balancing my meals better.Sure, sometimes it can come off as condescending, but what diet book doesn't?Instead of nitpicking maybe people should just get over their attitude and enjoy the book for what it's worth."
1,Unbelievably arrogant and not unique.,"Apparently this woman just likes to brag. About her worldy champagne drinking job, her life in the french country side, her self proclaimed wonderful story telling abiliby, her penthouse apartment (we get it). It seems like she wrote this book for vain middle aged america women who want to be worldly but arent but not before letting you know that all french people are born better than you and being American is like something she pitys you for. Unless you are some bragadocious wannabe socialite who can afford this unrealistic devotion of time and money skip this book. To me it is hard, and frankly, impossible to follow this plan if you live in most places in this country. You are better off reading Bob Greene's Best Life. There are the exact same tips minus the snobbery of proclaiming being French is somehow better than anything. I just rolled my eyes at half the things coming out of this women's mouth. This book is pure fantasy."
2,Very Overrated!,"Save your money and read the Fat Fallacy instead, if you want to really find out how eating the ""French way"" can make a difference in your life. This book is merely a light read with no real details and mostly full of recipes. You aren't going to read or learn anything new or enlightening that hasn't already been covered far better in other books regarding the same topic."
2,Don't bother..,"I did not plan to take this book as a literal eating plan but I was still surprised at the lack of any new information. The author tells the reader that they should ""diet"" for three months and they should be able to lose half the weight they need to. That is a really broad generalization - some people might want to lose 10 pounds and other 100! How does she know? Also, it just seems like there was page after page about how wonderful the food is in French, which doesn't help us. I can't get local French strawberries at any time! I was very disappointed."
5,Completely makes sense,"To all the reviewers who say that American women live different lives, etc.: my son went to a French school in Chicago for 7 years. I've met quite a few French mothers who've lived in the US for a while, and ALL of them are slim. They shop at the supermarket, they run errands, they take the kids to soccer practice, some of them work full time. However they have a completely different relationship with food than we do - it is to be enjoyed in moderation, not hated and consumed in large quantities.Another interesting note - hot lunch at the school always included vegetables, and the portions were just enough to satisfy hunger, no more. Now my son is at a public high school, and he complains that every lunch includes greasy french fries as the vegetable."
1,Avoid this rubbish,"The author of this book spends more time promoting products for her company than she does offering anything approaching practical advice for wemon to lose weight or maintain a slim figure. The tone of this book is very condescending and remplit with platitudes and snobish nonsense. The author has no qualifications to write on the subject of dieting and her advice is laughable at best! On a side note my mom is from france (Narbonne) and this lady doenst even look french, she must be from Stra√üburg (Allemange) Finally, if French wemon don`t get fat, then why are there so many jokes of the type `ta m√®re est tellemente grosse que` in france nowadays?"
1,"Boring, Boring Boring","I listened to the cd and thought wow America is a great country if this women was able to sell this book. I dont think she talks to the average american women and the problems that we face regarding weight. She sounds like she is talking to the more privledged and wealthy women who have the time to sit around and dine on salmon and champagne. I had an eating disorder a number of years ago and was just kind of curious as to what her remedy to weight gain was. I must say if you battling weight gain I think one question would be to ask yourself is it more serious than what this woman proposes,and if it is a deeper problem , go see a therapist or check out a 12 step group."
1,That's what she would have you believe,"If you have to read it, borrow, do not buy.You might want to check out the following related article:http://slate.com/id/2113911/"
3,viva la difference....,"I have a split review on this book, as a diet book there is nothing new under the sun except for some recipes. As a read it is very enjoyable recounting of the author's life with food and weight. French women walk everywhere, eat full fat food in small quantities and balance their intake overall - what a shock! The positives is that it is a common sense livable approach to life and eating. The negative is that it is that easy and don't need a book to tell you. The recipes were overall unappealing to me or too complicated- maybe I would be thinner if I consumed leek soup but who knows. There are better diet books and memoirs out there, save the money on this book and borrow it from a friend or library, not a keeper."
2,French Women DO Get Fat,"I wish the author would have come out with a Veuve Cliquot diet instead. It would have been a lot more fun and equally effective. This regime supposedly is all about dragging your groceries here and there, eating better (and lots of really awful soup, some of which may act as a diuretic. The Beverly Hills diet calls for lots of fruit, but either way you end up spending a lot of time in the ladies room.)Most French women smoke A LOT. A LOT. Most of France smokes a lot. That revs up one's metabolism and cuts hunger. I know of one really famous French model whose ""secret"" was an unlimited stash of thyroxin,which when taken in huge amounts, causes osteoporosis -- among other things.There isn't anything different here. In the words of Rita Mae Brown, if you wrap a red bow around it ...."
3,This isn't how the French do it!,"This is a great start on the concept of helping people to lose weight. However, the author still misses the mark by advocating certain foods, such as her soup recipe (think cabbage soup diet). If you really want to lose weight without eating special ""diet"" foods or doing extra exercise because you lost your self control, then you should check out ""The Overfed Head"" by Rob Stevens. He nails this concept on the head (no pun intended!) by helping people learn to get in touch with their hunger, rather than eating what someone else tells them to eat. Why not listen to your own body and lose weight naturally? That's how I lost 15 pounds during the holidays and that's how the French women really do it too!!!"
1,KILL ME NOW,"This stopped functioning the moment it was removed from it's package, before I had even handed it to my child.New batteries did not help and I just don't understand why these line of toys were made so badly.Sneaking it away from my 3 year old with autism to return it is like mission impossible, I am tired of returning these toys.This ENTIRE LINE of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse toys is AWFUL and DO NOT function correctly. I am very angry and annoyed with this."
5,great full size popcorn popper,This popcorn popper is the BEST! It was easy to set up and very easy to use. It has been a huge hit with our kids and grandkids...I would encourage everyone who has ever considered purchasing a full size popper to get this one!
5,One of the best cd i ever got.,i got this cd from one of my friend because my name is arash too and she thought it would be cool.i would rate this cd 5 star and i'd say it's the one the few cd that i could listen to whole songs and don't get tired of it.
1,Proof that faith alone theology twists Holy Writ.,"Sproul proves once again that he lacks an understanding of St. Paul's epistles. He forces his ""faith alone"" theology onto scripture instead of letting scripture guide him. Sproul needs to realize that the only place in scripture the word ""alone"" is placed next to the word ""faith"" is when it is preceded by ""not by"". I highly recommend Robert Sungenis's book ""NOT BY FAITH ALONE"" to every Protestant and Catholic who craves the truth to the question ""How can I be saved?""."
2,Not what I expected,"My intent was to enter a study on faith, what it is, how it is critical, and how to strengthen it. This book did not deliver. While there are a few nuggets of gold within it, overall Mr. Sproul does not maintain a focused writing style, causing me to find myself as lost as he was on many of his points. He also uses latin phrases numerous times unecessarily - as if only to show he knows the meanings and we don't. While I continue to value many of Mr. Sproul's writings and the work he does, this one is lacking. I would suggest ""Justification by Faith Alone"" by Jonathan Edwards as an alternative ISBN: 1-57358-107-0."
5,Mervielles Review,"I have owned this CD for two years and have yet to become tired of it. You will like it if you enjoy Classical music, Japanese Rock, Music with Dark themes or synth.I love this CD because the songs vary, they're a mix of dark, occult type songs and soft, violin/piano songs. And it all fits together. So I give it 5 stars!"
5,What Gabriel Stricker Said,"Gee, I wish I could find something other than what Mr. Stricker said in his review, but I can't. This is an incredible book of photos! If you've ever contemplated taking a series of photos of the many urban themes and sub-themes available, here's a catalog of some of the more amazing ones. My favorites? The duct tape series, the metal construction plates, all the signage, the blank billboards -- heck, they're all super.As an added bonus for New Yorkers -- it's fun tying in the visual cues to the real places.Superb."
5,perfect!!,"I was looking for this kind of socks to wear on my wedding day! And they are perfect, exactly what i was looking for!. Good quality, comfortable, good price and delivered on time!"
3,Good Enough,"I purchased these to put in the lunch box of my 3rd grade daughter. There are several that are cute and she enjoys her daily notes. I like the animal illustrations. That said, there are also several that are too religious and too old for a young child. I've cut the printed words off of these particular pages and written my own words. They are all feminine and only a few are suitable for young boys. There's likely a better product out there for what I am looking for (more age appropriate for an 8 y-o and not religious) - hope I find it!"
3,Cute but we have better,"My 3 year old son enjoys this one. My 4 1/2 year old daughter does not. The age is listed as 4-7 reading level, but I can not see a 6 or 7 year old really enjoying this. More of a cute rhyming type of story for a 2-3 year old."
5,"Jesse Bear, What Will You Wear?","Children love the ""sing Songy"" Rhymes. Illustrations are adorable. A must have for every childs collection."
5,One of our favorites,Some tales are just too good to get from the library. They simply need to be read again and again. This is one of those! A lovely book and a fun story.
5,Glorious singing,Glorious singing and great customs- the sound is marvelous and the minimal stage is done with great taste. You can tell when a good creative team got together to create a masterpiece.. I wish for more Opera DVDS like this. The sound is so wonderful that you will feel right there in the pit with the orchestra. Subtitles are exquisitely done .
2,Wearying wit is a hinderance,"At first, the author's trenchant remarks promised to add spice to what I feared would be the intimidating proces of learning some basic calculus. As it turned out, the book is not really about learning calculus so much as it is about the history of calculus and related mathematical subjects-- a fine topic in its own right, though not the one I had hoped to find in a book with this title. Unfortunately, even this interesting information is itself compromised by the author's unrelenting use of ""humorous"" comments (most with a snickery, knowing slant) which, in more judicious doses, might have been engaging."
2,Bad Lesson,"Not my favorite story. At the end of the story, the duck leaves the others in the mud after they helped him get unstuck."
4,Fun,"This is a fun read for ALL.... I started reading this book to my son when he was 2years old, two years on and he still loves it... One of those books that is a pleasure to read over and over again."
5,Versatile timer,"You can stick it to the fridge, clip it on your pants pocket or stand it on the counter. This timer has a pleasant ring - not too loud, not too soft - and not annoying. What else could you ask???"
2,Can't hear it.,Why do they have such a problem with the volume. I can barely hear this timer if at all. Don't buy it unless your hearing is a good as your dogs!
1,Zero stars rating not available,Could not hear the alarm on this joke of a timer unless I held it up to my ear. Then it was very soft. This is a classic example of junk from China.
