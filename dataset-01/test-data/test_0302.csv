3,I expected more.,"This book is more like an entertaining pamphlet. If you're browsing for curiosity, this book will work. It lightly details delivering a child, allegator wrestling and so forth. If you're looking for a survival manual, try PRIMITIVE WILDERNESS SKILLS: Applied and Advanced or SAS Survival Manual. I'm back to get SAS Survival Manual, regretting that a friend paid what he did to buy this book for me."
4,I like it!,"I just purchased this for $35. I haven't purchased a pack in 20 years. My last external frame coleman aluminum pack works great and has lasted many years. It just wasn't as functional as I'd like...one main compartment and 4 side pockets. It was time to upgrade.This pack seems well made and has plenty of pockets and fastners. I'm large 6'2"" 230 and have adjusted the pack to the maximum. The hip belt appears to fit ok, and the pack sits well. I haven't loaded it and put it on for hours yet...that will be the final test.Overall I'm happy with the pruchase.Why didn't I give it five stars, I don't know...I'm a pretty critcal person and I expect a lot for my money. I'll adjust it to five after I've used it if rides well, but remember I'm at the larger size for the average hiker. It may fit a smaller body perfectly."
4,"tis ok, tis ok!","just as good as their first A-Team album, and being from australia myself and knowing well of Maya Jupiter (a groovy chick who represents sydney well) and MC Trey (who I also consider kinda weak)... Trey and Maya are both well below the standard of MC which australia has to offer... AUstralian mC's like 'Pegz', 'MC Lazy Grey', 'Brad Strut', 'Bias B', 'hilltop hoods', 'Downsyde', 'Hunter and Dazastah' are all vastly superior to Trey and Maya both in terms of dexterity, flow, meaning and energy...Well, just doing my part to spread ozhiphop to the world...Ace and Ab's are once again excellant... if you want to here what else Abstract did in austrlaia, pic up Resin Dogs latest album 'Hi-Fidelity Dirt' and catch a few more of the accents that no one can stand... ha haaa...cheers,"
1,Boring!,What an incredible disappointment! This is a boring and dreadful video.The sound is awful and there is really no new material. Two of the speakersare nothing more than Freddie Mercury impersonators. Pass on this piece ofnonsense and buy Queen Rock Montreal + Live Aid.I will always remember the way Freddie electified the audience at Live Aid.
2,not as good as the first,"I loved the stories in the original book, Tajar Tales. I have heard 3 stories out of ""A Perfect Day"" and they do not live up to the originals. I think they are a good addition to the stories when you have read all the originals and need more, but I think the highly inflated price is not worth it."
2,Elvis: Word for Word,"This was an alright book. I have read others that were better. There was a lot of repeating of the conversations sometimes the wording was a little different. The book was fairly formatted nicely and easy to read but boring. If you are an avid fan, there are other books out there to buy and read. If you are just an average person wanting to read something about Elvis, then this is a good book."
4,My 5 yr old loves this book,"My son adores this book, as he was already a huge MSB fan and a huge dinosaur lover. The only thing I don't like about it as the parent reading it to him, was there seems to be a disconnect in the story regarding the characters. The book does not refer to the characters by name in the story which feels very odd to me after reading the MSB chapter books. It is only a slight weirdness and maybe I'm being too picky, because overall we do love this book and will purchase others like it."
1,"Not accurate information, be careful using this one","The info in this book doesn't follow the Bible facts about the creation of Earth, man and animals. Be careful using this book. Make sure it follows an explaination to your youngster about Bible truths. This is a FICTION book and not based on facts."
3,Works ok,The track is fine but the engine is kind of weak. It struggles to go up hills. I guess you can't ask for much from something of this size and that uses a single AA battery. I'm just not too impressed.
5,Am I minging or Blingin?,"Well, as the co author of this book, Super fish bucket sized Jade Goody must be asking herself this question: Am I minging or blinging?Regular people must surly know the answer to this question, especially onced they have tasted the golden shower that belongs to miss Goody.In saying that, maybe the view is better from the rear? Then again, probally not much of an improvement!"
5,Good for sanding in tight spaces.,"The SAIT sanding belts work well for sanding small spaces where a file or hand sanding would otherwise be needed. They are reasonably priced from Amazon and, as usual, shipment was fast."
5,Very soothing,"I get ribbed all the time because I like New Age music. Sitting at my computor, working on stuff, and having the music playing low in the background, is relaxing. I am a music nut, with over 2600 CD's from every genre; I listen to what I'm in the mood for. There's a time and a place for music such as this.Arkenstone carefully and successfully blends his soothing melodies with the gentle sounds of a spring rain on this CD. In essence, the rain compliments the music, and the music compliments the rain, and it's this combination that keeps the music interesting. If one has a problem with tention from time to time, and who doesn't, this CD will help you relax; it's that good."
4,"Low cost, reliable solution","The transfer switch is very sturdy and well built, however I have two issues with the device. First, although the utility and the generator pair of breakers are clearly identified, it is not obvious what the source of power is, unless you read the indistinct 'On/Off' markings on the breakers themselves. Perhaps a pointer attached to the mechanical interlocking device and combined with proper labeling can remedy the situation. The other objection is a lack of a bus or lug for connecting the neutral wires. Nevertheless the skilful electrician can easily solve this problem. Otherwise I am very satisfied with the product since it delivers a great value for a low price."
3,IT was great but it skips,"my Zumba dvd that i got was great and its fun, but at the end of the exercise the dvd is skipping at the end in a few spots . so the dvd was ok. i just wish it didnt skip at the end in few spots."
3,zumba cd,said it was like new but it has alot of pauses while playing it still a good price and I can use it
3,zumba dvd,DVD was scrached and doesn't play all the way through. But the dvd was used so it was to be expected. The work out is great inspite of all of this.
2,Didn't work,"I'm not sure if I was using them correctly, but they did not noticeably reduce noise. They were reasonably comfortable, and I molded them to try to cover my ear, but they just didn't do anything for me."
3,Not as good as they advertise,Can not have the whole plug in ear way to big...and you can still hear someone snoring when they are in the same bed.
2,"""Silicone Ear plugs"" Do not block noise well.","I bought these for studying at the library and other places around campus. I get distracted easily so I need quite but these did not do the trick. I've always used the ""in ear"" foams plugs (These form a seal outside of your ear canal) and these silicone plugs did not even block out half of what the foam plugs do. I could hear people walking around. And since I opened the box to try it out I can no longer return them to amazon. Waste of money if your trying to keep noise out for studying. However, they may help out for keeping water out of your ears."
3,Catches your hair = hell,"These, if fitted correctly block out everything, even airplane noise. but LADIES BEWARE, if this gets on your hair it is like having bubblegum stuck in your hair. painful to get out"
1,Very poor design of hearing protection,"Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone ear plugs are strange in design and a mess to use. The plugs are a sticky lump of silicone that is inserted into the outer ear - not the ear canal. The plugs are held in place by their stickiness and come out of your ear on pillows or anything else that brushes against them. As a product these things are silly and useless.Dream Essentials, LLC is the seller of the product. They delivered the item promptly and I have no complaints about them at all - they did a good job."
5,Mack Pillow earplugs,I love the Mack earplugs . I use them in my pool and zero water get into my ears. Thanks
5,Best Leatherman for the Size,"We have two of the Leatherman Juice Multi-Tools and a variety of the other styles. My go to before a camping trip is always the Juice. It is a great size. Fits in the pocket on my backpack designed for a knife and has everything I need no matter what the situation. I am a scout leader and although the scouts could probably get away with a smaller version, it is important I have the extra tools if necessary."
3,my misconception,"my mistake, I really assumed by the photo that this was going to be a LOT bigger...I didnt think to check the small print. I gave it away."
4,Finally - Wayne Wonder,"Took a while, but I am glad that one of my favorite singers finally hit the ""big-time"". Been a fan since '88. Love the album. My favorite tune is ""Just Another Day"", The harmonies by Sadeki and Wayne is awesome. Question: Does Sadeki have an album out? Where can I find more songs from him? Keep up the good work Wayne! Fan FO' LIFE!!!"
5,Nifty,"I do not yet dye my hair but every so often I notice bits of gray. I picked up one these combs a couple of years ago in a local drugstore and found it to be a perfect solution to cover those few strands without having to commit dyeing. The drugstore sold to large chain and I could not find this comb anywhere. So happy that Amazon has come thru! Okay its a quirky item. There is slab of thick brown coloring in the comb, which must be submerged in hot water to soften then combed thru the grays. Works really great for me tho. If you have just a little gray and darkish brown hair this is a easy, quick fix. Love it."
4,"good game, but not good anough","I am a big fan of Mario Tennis. I loved the first one for the N64 and Gameboy color. I think This a great way to refreash the Mario franchise. First of all I have to admit that the graphics are incredible, uhm.......for a gamecube game. Not to say the the gamecube doesn't have good graphics it's just that........oh, never mind. But, anyway the gameplay gets kind of boring after a while but it is very fun at first. If you quickly fine this game boring. Then you would probably like the special mode. Other then that you should find this game very adictive and fun to play. Second of all the multiplayer allright. I still think online would be the best. I would probably have given it a 5, if it wasn't for the online failure. Over all this game is great for the holidays."
1,review of binocular camera,This item came in apparently good condition. Taking still pictures worked however it was supposed to be able to take video pictures as well. This I was unable to do. When i inquired about this I received an E-Mail that this item was not supported by manufacturer. I have since returned this item to amazon for refund.
1,Galileo 1.3 MegaPixel Digital Binocular Camera,"Well, I did not see in the description, anywhere, that the software was made for a PC and not a Mac which is what I have. So, that was out. Then, when I tried to use it just as binoculars, I discovered that one of the lens was in backwards. So, on one side I saw what was in front of me but, on the other side it was backwards. I was not happy but, didn't send it in for a refund because I had thrown the box away. That's my last experience with Galileo until their products improve."
2,Right for the Price,"For the price the mask was good,but i found the eye holes very uncomfortable. The mask does keep the face warm however."
5,"""No kidding; I was there ... ""","Thus starts many a 'sea story' or 'war story' but not this one. However, reading this, you will feel that you were there. In short, it's an incredible story for fiction, but this book is real history making the 'plot' all the more remarkable. Big things come from small packages ... get the book. Read it. Read it again in a year. It will still be captivating."
4,Issues #15-19 focus on a young man and his estranged father in Philadelphia,"This third TPB collects issues #15-#19 of the acclaimed Brian Azzarello/Eduardo Risso crime series. This is the longest story arc thus far in the series, focusing on a young man and his estranged father. The story opens at a murder scene on the streets of North Philadelphia, where Agent Graves reveals himself to the young man and offers him the famed attache and information on his father's whereabouts. Carlo and Daphne (the thug and cafe waitress couple from issue #8) visit from Miami as connections to the previous issues continue to appear. Fans of the first two volumes will almost certainly enjoy this one as well. I especially appreciated the references to Philadelphia throughout all five issues and the trip to see the Phillies game."
3,sizes run small,I purchased a size medium of these gloves and I find them to run a bit small. I weigh 120 lbs. and have a hard time getting them on. If I had known this I would have ordered a larger size.
4,heyyou,I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. He is only 18 months old and the plane seemed a little small for him to ride on. He is a big Elmo fan so that was a plus and he could push the plane around.
2,Broke after 3 months,"My 15 month old son got this for his first birthday. He has rode it indoors, not a ton, but enough. It does tip forward very easily, which is why I never let him take it outside. The steering wheel broke completely off the other day and not just in one spot. The whole housing is broken and not able to be fixed. Luckily Christmas is around the corner and he is getting a ride on dump truck."
3,"TONS of Fun, but tips over VERY easily","I bought this toy 3 years ago for my first child, and he loved it. In fact,it has been a hit for all three of my children. They all love it, and even though my oldest is 3 1/2, he still tries to get on and play with it, though he is too big for it now. My only issue with it is that it tips over VERY easily. When your child is riding it it doesn't tip side ways, but if they lean too far over the front, it will tip forward. The worst is when your child is not on it and just playing with it. If the wings are down, any weight on them will tip the toy. All of my children have ended up getting bumps and bruises with this toy, however, they have had countless of hours of fun on it too. Would I buy it again? Yes. Parents, you just need to supervise your little ones with it. Once they have mastered it overall, they will do fine."
3,Good price but messed up!,I got this toy for my nephews b-day and well when I got it I checked to make sure it was in the box than just wrapped it and gave it to him.... WELL when he got it he started to ride it and it makes a HORRIABLE clicking noise and its cracked behind the front blades my guess is its from the way they shipped it!!!!!! I felt like a complete jerk for giving him this toy.. yes its very cute and he LOVES planes so over all it was going to be a GREAT buy its just annoying the click and dont know how long it will last untill the crack gets bigger and it breaks!!!
3,Tips forward too easily for little ones,"My son has had this toy for 2 years, beginning when he was 16 months old. The plane has a catch in the back so that it doesn't tip backwards, but there is nothing in the front to keep it from tipping forward. We had a number of incidents where he was trying to climb off or on, and he leaned too much on the front, causing him and the plane to launch forward. Luckily, we never had any injuries other than a few minor head bonks. Even when he was a little older and had used the toy for a while, he would still have trouble occasionally. He was over 2 before he really got the hang of it, but by then he didn't like it as much. I will admit that despite the safety flaw, he did love this toy when he was young. I cringed every time he found where I hid it though."
5,A wonderful read,"This is simply a wonderful book, very well researched and entertaining to read. If you know anyone interested in technical things, science, and/or social history get them this book."
4,"Useful, but could be better","This tool has a good assortment of tools, some more useful than others. The scissors are great, and easily worth having this on your keys just for that. The bottle opener is functional but a bit annoying to use, and the tweezers are good quality as long as your not looking for precision use.Overall, the biggest complaint is that you need to open the scissors to use the other functions, which can be painful if your not careful and inconvenient regardless. Ultimately, it will take up a decent amount of space in your pocket for good scissors and tweezers, the other tools are less than exceptional."
5,Perfect Size,I own a full-size Leatherman but wanted something I could have on me at all times. The Micra is perfect for just that.
4,"Like the tool, but not thrilled with the finish","First off this tool is shiny black. It is not a subdued black like on the squirt black handled tool. Also the handles are just black aluminum slip over pieces that go over a standard micra tool. I wish they made these in a black finish like black oxide, but they don't currently. The tool itself is an awesome companion to a larger tool or is a great stand alone in an ultra light bug out or backpacking load out. The scissors get used more than the blade for me so this tool is great for fishing and small crafts. The scissors slice through leather like a hot knife through butter. The standard stainless finish is better in my opinion, but my wife has a blue one for her desk that looks more politically correct and unobtrusive in an office."
5,Micra Multitool,I have brought apox 4-5 of these over the years and just love them. They are very versatile and being small they are easy to carry. And easy to loose but thats my problem. Great little tool
5,Excellant,"Carry it with me always. I find uses for it almost everyday. Excellant, small and easy to use and carry"
4,great book for reference,"Now I took this out from the library and bought it. So I think its a great book, lots of fun ideas with art. Now here is my only beef: They could give more step by step and write more. They talk like you have 50 years of art teaching under your belt. Just put a stem on the tree and add water color leaves. Uhhh, how about more details and more step by step pictures??!! Still love it though."
3,Nice except one side is thicher then the other,"Well made, but not as well as Leatherman Micra or Swiss knives.The side with scissors is about 1mm thicker than the other, which looks terrible and stupid in the direction of end. The designer should pay more attention to details.Maybe it's because the juice series have several items such as juice c2, XE6,...But I still think it's better if both side have the same thickness. Besides, juice XE6 has the same problem too.This is why I give it 3 stars ranking."
4,A real talent,"I've just discovered David Bridie and bought this CD on the strength of the Hotel Radio title track. I still think it's the stand out track, but the rest is first class and grows on you."
3,A good album but disturbed sound,"Unfortunately Sony SPECIAL PRODUCTS brought out another of Mahalia's great original albums named 'Everytime I Feel The Spirit' ,but with an unbelievable bad sound on cd. If I take my over 40 years old Columbia Records album I find a thousand times better sound than here.The lost 2 stars are for that bad sound-quality."
4,"very light, convenient travel adapter","I also bought this for my Dell M1210, just before a trip from the US to Japan. It powers and charges my laptop just fine, plus it is lighter and thinner than the Dell power brick. It doesn't get noticeably hot, either - even after many straight hours of operation on the plane. The smarttips are a bit expensive, but they work just fine and are worth the investment.Aside from the price, the one negative point is the short plug connecting the adapter to the wall outlet, which leaves the adapter dangling in most cases. other than that, however, this is a great travel adapter."
3,Meet the colors - ok for preschoolers,"Of all the ""Meet the ..."" DVDs, this one is the weakest only because the authors chose to exclude some popular colors. My daughter is indignant that the color ""pink"" is missing, and my son wonders where ""brown"" went. It's a good DVD for toddlers, but preschoolers will likely already know all the colors that are presented. The quality of content is on par with the rest of the DVD series so I would recommend it for 1 and 2 yr-olds."
1,I would not recommend this book,"I purchased it. Tried to get into it. Thought the advice was not well organized and it related to low level play, and frankly, I have read much better books. Sorry to the author - but he did get full retail price from me and I got no benefit from him."
2,broke after guarantee ended,"This product worked great, until the solid metal piece at the hinge shattered in my hand! My grip strenth is not very strong, so this was very surprising. I called up pampered chef, who informed me that because I had purchased it four years ago, it was not covered under the three year guarantee. I don't mind spending a lot on something if it lasts, but only lasting four years is not worth it. I was curious if this was a freak incident, but after viewing other similar complaints, it would appear it was not. I will now be trying out a different brand."
5,"More Everything for Early Learning, Grade Preschool",This item is GREAT for pre preschool learning!!! our little great neices & great nephews & adopted grandchildren are benefiting tremendously from this book!The youngest at age 2 began it 6wks ago & is ALREADY able to PRINT his NAME on paper & art board & can spell & add & subtract & trace & color INSIDE the lines after only 6wks!!! GREAT for getting your little ones ready for pre-K!!! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!
5,excellent,great book for beginning homeschoolers or anyone wanting to give preschoolers a gentle backup to other education systems
5,Gentleman By Givenchy For Men,"have used Gentleman Givenchy for years ;this is my first time ordering from amazon.com,& found the whole ordering process quite professional & user friendly.thanks Amazon !!"
5,"Work great, look better",I love this style and the satin nickel finish is really nice. I am pleased with the purchase and they seam very sturdy. Definately worth the cost and that wasn't even that much
4,Like it,Great service. Arrived on time and. Great product and quality. xxx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
5,Get out of the box....,"This was my first introduction to Loretta LaRoche. I found this DVD entertaining, humourous and thought provoking. It was a wonderful reminder to choose to live life with joy and optimism."
2,Bad Choice of text,"I am sorry if you have been told you have to use this book for class. The information is all there - E&M doesn't exactly change, but the format is amazingly confusing. The typeface is offensive and the symbols are not the standards. Other little things, like the way previously defined equations are referenced (43^19 means section 43 EQ19) are confusing and so over used that you can't read one page of the book without haveing to look something up elsewhere in the book. The book is cheap for a reason, corners were cut to print such a small book. If you have not done any E&M it might be ok because you won't be looking for the standard symbols and formatting. Otherwise, if you have the choice, use a different book."
2,Damaged goods,This product was fine but I ordered 2 and one of them came with a broken mug. I haven't yet figured out how to get a replacement.
3,decent for use,"I purchased this product a few month ago. It is decent. I would not recommend for commercial use. It seems like they cheaped out on quality and it is thinner than most ive seen. I purchased some a few years back, not sur which brand but was a quality product. Overall for price it is average and serves it purpose."
5,Perfect for the price,"There is a little bad point from manufacturing, the joints are not perfect matched. Anyway, it's doing ok. I don't need to move it so often. I only need it for organizing my papers and it's perfect for its price. I like it."
5,Volant 35060 Air Scoop,"I installed this item on my 2002 Chevy Duramax with the Volant 15866 Cool Air Intake Kit, it was easy to install and looks and sounds great! I haven't checked the mileage yet."
3,Could have been so much more...,"Being a fan of the Avatar show on nickelodeon, i had to buy the wii version of this game... it seems to me the game was rushed into being relased on time with the wii console... Playing with all the characters and have them bend the elements is the only fun part that made me give this game 3 stars... looking at the characters from the top the entire time makes this game feel like i'm playing some nintendo game from the 90's.... so when comparing it to zelda twilight princess then this game is a complete bust... if you are a fan of the avatar series, then this game brings some level of fun though..."
4,"Fun game, not too frustrating or boring","This is the first game we rented with our new Wii. I have to say that I have really enjoyed playing (34 yr old mom). My seven year old daughter also enjoys it. The game play is very simple, allowing you to conquer the ""boss"" in each level after trying just a couple times or even the first time you try. My daughter was also able to play without getting frustrated.Even though it might be too easy for hard core gamers, there are still several levels to the game that make it more than a kiddie game. You can try to find all the hidden objectives in each level, and the items you collect are an interesting mix of headbands, rings, robes, boots, and various amulets and ingredients for potions. I found myself rushing to get dinner finished so we could spend more time at play!"
3,Wii game,This wasn't as much fun as expected. Maybe it will get better with time. Thanks for having it available.
3,Really fun.......but could be a lot better,"I think this game is really fun,but I was dissapointed because I was excited to do bending skills like the characters in the show.The menu controls don't always work. The game controls don't work well.Fighting Firebenders is fun.The game is not too hard, but not too easy.If u reaaly want this game, you should wait untill the price goes goes down, or buy it for gcube,because it's probably not too different."
3,the one that got away,"teena is bad, make no mistake. this cd has the usual fare of the other compilation discs. the stand out feature is the cut, ""gonna have my cake..."". this cut is not on any other disc except the original--wild and peaceful. the jazz flavor of this cut can only be appreciated by true teena fans. ..."
4,Great for Start-ups!,"This book speaks to the entreprenuer providing straight forward terms abou the processes needed to start and build an eBusiness. As a consultant, I would recommend this book to anyone starting on their own, to understand what is needed for your company before bringing in ""professionals"" to work with you. You'll have a better understanding of what's needed and how to work together to build the capabilities for your business."
3,Something's missing...,"A few songs featured on the European soundtrack but not on the American one are what brings this CD down 2 stars. The song ""do your thing"" by basement jaxx (featured in the trailer/preview and in the film) is among the most notably absent. But overall not bad."
4,please help!,"Hello. I love ""Bend it Like Beckham!"" I watch this movie every other day. I heard that there are different versions of the soundtract. Can anyone PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE help me find the CD version that has the song that was played the night they went to the club in Germany. Not the songs in the actual club but the Indian song that played when Jes came outside in the nice outfit (after her makeover) right before they went to the club. I really, really like this song and would like to get it. If it's not on any of the versions, can someone tell me the name so that I can get it. Thanks! :D"
1,Avoid this underpowered version..,"Don't buy this pathetically stripped down and underpowered version when you can get the real thing on import! The import version has one of the most dynamically interesting songs, ""Baddest Ruffest"" by Back Yard Dog that I've heard in a long while, plus you get two extra songs and some funny dialogue bytes from the movie."
1,Complete confusing waste of time,"I love James Patterson, and since I've read everything he's written except this one, I figured what the heck. It's boring, confusing, I can't tell which set of characters he's talking about until I see a specific name - he doesn't separate the characters/story lines in any sort of way - some of the characters don't have anything to do with the plot and are confusing. I'm forcing myself to finish it, in case he gets to the point at the end, but every page is a struggle. I can hardly believe this is his work, I think my 12th grade son writes better than this. Boring, completely confusing, awful and a total waste of money. I'd rate it a zero if I could."
2,Not Patterson's Best,"This is James Patterson's first book and I am happy to report he does get better. I am a huge fan of JP's - I have read all of his Alex Cross and Murder Club books...now I am going back to some of his older books. If I had started with this book I am not sure I would have read any more of his books.The THOMAS BERRYMAN NUMBER is not very well written. It tells the story of a hitman through the eyes of several people. It jumps from 'present' day back to the past and back again. It tells the same story from different perspectives. At times this style is very hard to follow. He introduces too many characters and it is hard to keep up with everyone and their relationship to the story. The main story line is good but the style of telling the story is confusing and difficult to read.If you want to read James Patterson - try one of his Alex Cross books, they are wonderful. Skip this one!!"
1,save your money & time,"this book was in one word ""BORING"". It just never got going. I think Thomas Patterson's other stuff is exciting and fast paced, this is the total antithesesis. Horrible! It was written a long time ago, he's a much better writer now"
1,Very disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this after having enjoyed ""Jack and Jill"". I was, however, very disappointed. This book was hard to read and difficult to follow. I could not get into this book. I found it to be very boring. I had a hard time finishing it."
1,James Patterson Thomas Berryman,Very poor quality not as stated pages just bearly hanging in well used not as stated. Very dissappointed. Review not on the book but the seller. Book as always James Patterson never fails...
3,A So-So Read,"I thought this was a good book, but not at all what I was expecting. The characters were developed very well, but everything I read said that it was very suspenseful, but I did not find it to be suspensful. It was engrossing, and I was interested in finding out the ending, but not one of those books I could not put down. Well worth the time to read, but just don't expect to be totally wrapped up in it."
3,1st novel by J Patterson,"I found it a little hard to follow, but this was his first. He has grown a lot since then."
2,Only for Patterson completists,"Judging from the reviews here on Amazon this book was really bad, but since it had won an Edgar Award I decided to give it a try. Now, the biggest mystery about ""The Thomas Berryman Number"" is why it won the award. The writing (a first person narrative) is not bad and occasionally funny, but the plotting is very weak. In the beginning of the book we're told the mayor of Nashville was assassinated and then we get to follow a journalist who investigates the assassination. There's never any suspense and I never really cared about the story of the characters. It's a quick read but a pointless one. The only reason ""The Thomas Berryman Number"" is still in print is because it was written by James Patterson and I would recommend it only to Patterson completists."
1,Easy to put down,"I listen to a lot of audiobooks, and this one I just couldn't get into. I found it confusing...in fact, after listening to the first 1/2 disc I went back to the beginning and started over to see if I had 'drifted off' somewhere, but it was just as confusing the second time around. A little ways into the second disc, I just gave up on it and made another selection. I've listened to a lot of Patterson books and liked most of them...at least the ones which he actually wrote and didn't just lend his name to the cover."
4,The Memoirs of Glueckel of Hameln,"A fascinating first-hand account of a Jewish woman's life in the 17th Century.The memoirs , mainly written for her children as she struggled to take over her late husband's business,show a very pious woman who is devoted to her children.Glueckel is better known in Germany than in the US, but she deserves a place in the history of life at that time. She is remarkable in being able to read and write at a time when that was not so common , especially for women.If you can get over the many religious passages, you will enjoy reading this book."
1,more of the same--only less this time,"This book contributes nothing to the success of a trader. The techniques described are re-ground rehash of what others have discussed for many years and are worhtless to any serious market trader. I'm certain that the author's goal when he wrote this book was to earn some money he probably lost while trading the approaches he presents in the book. Don't waste your money on this one guys, do yourself a favor and buy your broker lunch, you'll get more in return than you do with this empty gibberish.jackal"
1,A reader,"I can't believe that any one could publish such an empty collection of gibberish. What a waist of time and money. All this book contains is the collection of expressions found on Wall Street without explanation and meaning. Instead read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, The Market Wizards, The Crowd you will get more inside, then this book will ever produce."
3,Good but better out there!,"Neill's book is good but I feel there are other books worth reading first. ""Tricks of the floor trader"" reminds me of Jake bernstein talking about how great these seasonal patterns are.Teh book does give a good job defining some ideas that you might e able to apply in your own trading, but many are all known widely. This book does not reveal any secrets to trading. In this book.the author makes fun of trading courses and simultaneously leads you on to think his book will help you trade better. No book can make you trade better, it's just not that easy. If you really want a book that gives you a genuine feeling of being on the trading floor YOU MUST BUY ""PIT BULL"" by Marty ""Buzzy"" Schwartz. ""Pitbull"" will give you the fealing of being right there on the floor and make you feel as if it were you making the same decisions. I t will make you laugh histarically and cry! Buy it, Read it, and Reap!"
3,bunch of tips,"This book is written in short hodgepodge chapters like Eng and Longstreet. Weintraub presents a myriad of trading ideas, thoughts, tips and cliches to the reader. 90% of it is not going to be beneficial to any trader, but in the pile of dung.. there are some gold nuggets if you dig around long enough. The chapter at the end on spreads is very interesting and would be worth looking into."
4,The way things were,"Written by the Apple ""House Hippie,"" De Lello discusses what it was like to ""work"" in the Apple press office under Derek Taylor in the late sixties. Parts are funny, and the entire atmosphere of complete spongeing and absurdity is made very vivid. The Beatles themselves play only marginal roles in the book."
4,Soothing...,"This is a very calm version of the typical David Arkenstone, which to me is almost music to fall asleep to. It would make very good background music to a quiet cocktail party, but don't drive while listening to this album."
1,"Coyote Cut out, :(",it looks good on the site but it is actually lousyits a cardboard cut- out flew away with a strong wind the next day.
5,America...Here is the next big singing sensation!!,"I really enjoyed this cd. It was a gift. However I am planning to give a copy to every music lover on my gift list. If you like JoJo and K-C, Marvin Gaye, Alicia...You will love Ke'red.True talent without the studio tricks. Buy It!!"
2,Disappointing,"These dishes looked great in the picture - but were something of a let-down when they arrived. They're fairly cheaply made. The sizes of the bowls are not uniform; there are bubbles in the glass; the hand painting is hasty and inaccurate, with smears of colour where there shouldn't be any; and there are flaws in the red colouring on the foot of the dishes - in some spots it's scratched off, in others blotchy.Taken all together these small flaws make for a substandard product that isn't really worth the money. I would have sent them back, but I live in the UK and arranging and paying for return postage to the US wasn't worth it, so I cut my losses and kept them.Not really recommended, sadly."
4,10th victim,Nice example of 60's film style. Futuristic setting with morality tale of dubious impact. Ursula is appropriately clothed and therefore visually stunning. Marcello has good contrasting role to some of his Fellini characters.
2,Italian science fiction in The 10th Victim,"I enjoy Italian films, and I enjoy Ursula Andress. From the cover of the box, I thought I'd get to see Ursula naked in the film. She comes close during her strip at the beginning of the film, but never does get naked. The film is a sci-fi/fantasy about a world where instead of war, people can relieve their agressions by registering as hunters. Hunters try to kill other hunters. A hunter who successfully kills 10 other hunters, can retire very rich. Once registered as a hunter, a person either kills 10 other hunters or is killed--they cannot leave the game. Hunts are televised world-wide. Ursula's 10th victim is Marcello Mastrianni (spelling?), and they fall in love. I found the story to be rather silly, and was disappointed in there being no nudity in this film."
4,"Not What I Expected, But Still Enjoyable","I originally ordered this, along with ""Windscapes,"" thinking it would be a new age music CD. As it turns out, while it does have some music it's 50% sound effects and ethereal keyboard sounds. It is an ""ambience"" CD, not a music CD, and I wish they'd make that clearer in the product description. However, having said that I enjoy it as an ambience CD. It's great to listen to while napping or writing."
1,Not at ALL what is in the description,"I ordered this along with the 1550 case. First, the 1550 case is WAY too big for the PCS soft case. You can almost fit two of the soft cases into the the 1550 hard case. Second, there's no way a laptop would fit in there let alone a laptop and a DSLR like I was hoping, like what was described. So I called Pelican, and they don't even make this soft PCS case???? I'm not sure what's going on here but stay away!"
2,This is not for espresso & it's plastic,"This is a horrible grinder for serious espresso enthusiasts. It doesn't get fine enough, and the idea behind espresso grinding is that the grinds are uniform. Barely adequate for an espresso drinker on a budget, but the consistency and crema are disappointing. Oh, and it's plastic. Expect the plastic tabs on the grind size adjuster within to break.Why two stars and not one? It was all I could afford and it does perform okay for its price level. It just upsets me that they couldn't spend the extra 50 cents to make working parts out of aluminum and had to use cheap plastic."
3,"Good grinder, BUT .....",This is a great coffee grinder. It doesn't make a mess & grinds evenly. BUT it has no timer; it is almost impossible to get a consistant amount of ground coffee.
5,So Far-out!!!,This book is awesome! I learned a lot of my hippie skills from this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone even the slightest bit interested in the hippies. This book teaches you about everything from how to name your hippie baby to ambling to protests. You MUST purchase this book! You won't regret it.
2,For Wannabee Hippies,"I think if you're an old hippie (like me) you know everything in this book already..Now if you can justttt remember it!!! LOL I think it is written for young people who want to discover the art of being a hippie, and adopt that lifestyle, more than for old heads or the people who have ""been there, done that"" For the old heads, I would recommend a book I've had since it first came out in the 60's (i think) Living on the Earth by Alicia Bay Laurel. Or Carla Emery's book The Encyclopedia of Country Lore, these people lived the life and walked the walk, and the information is 'right on'. Namaste."
5,Exceptional Dean Martin,"An exceptional reproduction of the original. Well worth buying. This is Dean at his very best, during his ride at the top of popularity."
5,One Cool CD!,"This CD includes TWO LP's recorded by Dino in the late fifties. The first, ""This Time I'm Swingin'"" has some really great tunes,a big band (with strings), and some swingin'arrangements.The other, earlier LP (from 1956), ""Pretty Baby"" teams Dean with a small combo (a couple of horns and a rhythm section)and a chorus with some fine Gus Levine arrangements. I was thrilled when I discovered that this CD exists - I had bought both LPs while I was in high school (I go back a ways)and, needless to say, they were both very worn. I have been playing this CD non-stop since I recieved it a couple of weeks ago. Dean is the best - relaxed, cool, and smooth. Give this gift to someone you love - young or old- they will enjoy it!"
2,Overindulgent look at New England WASPs,"Ms. Stuart writes engagingly and at first I thought this history might include some fresh insight into Boston Brahmin culture. Somewhere in the middle of the book I began skimming, avoiding timeworn descriptions of WASP snobbery and emotional coldness. The one area in which the story might have added some depth, generations of psychiatric hospitalizations, is treated as a tour guide of hospitals for the rich. This book will only interest those completely unfamiliar New England WASP culture."
3,"Great service, product could be better","I was happy to find this butter slicer to replace the one I had that had broken wires when my husband tried to cut a frozen stick of butter! The service was great but I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the product because it is not as sturdy as the one I had before, even being made of stainless steel! The wires seem to have more flex than the one I had before. We can use this one (on non-frozen butter) but will use it carefully."
1,this is terrible,"I dont even know what to say. This has got to be the worst :w: album yet. It seems that through time Rudy is getting worse and his obsession with these terrible female singers is getting to be too much. I loved :w: when all there was, was good industrial slammish and rythm. Now all I hear is offkey lyrics (which a 5 year old could write) to boring music. Dont waste your money on this garbage. Rudys legacy ended at Wreath of Barbs."
2,THE CHILD DEVIANT!,"I am a huge Wumpscut fan, but I am sorry to report, this is my least favorite :W: album. It's not that Rudy is lacking in talent, ...he is and always will be one of my favorite artist, and by far one of the greatest artist in electro/industrial scene, but not with this album. If your new to :W:, please don't start here...I suggest Embryodead, Music For A Slaughtering Tribe, Eevil Young Flesh, Bunker Gate 7, or Cannibal Anthem. Even Bonepeeler, and Wreath Of Barbs would be better than Evoke. Evoke is not a great Wumpscut album."
5,Excellent transfer from vinyl to CD,"I was amazed at the transfer quality, as earlier works usually sound tinny. I forgot how divers Cream is. It is as if they were experimenting with different types of songs. This is better than having variations of the same thing across the whole CD.It did not take me long to fall in love with the individual songs again. Everyone is familiar with ""White Room"" which is what made me think of this first but few remember ""Pressed Rat and Warthog"" or ""Those Were the Days"".Bottom line the album is worth discovering or rediscovering."
3,Lied Des Teufels / Hanuman (Kuckuck),"A bit confusing here, but this posting looks to be a 2-CD release of this obscure German krautrock band's two albums - 'Hanuman' ('71) and 'Lied Des Teufels' ('73). Band name appears to be the actual title of each lp reissue. Following me so far? The music here didn't do all that much for me - simply too artsy-fartsy. Couple of tunes that I thought are okay were ""Wenn Du Fragst"" [English translation: If You Ask], the well-played ""Nichts"" [trans: Nothing], ""Gott, Geld Und Freiheit"" [meaning God, Money And Liberty] and the eleven-minute jamming ""Sonnenaufgand"" [translation: Sunrise"". Line-up: Ralf Schultz - guitar & vocals, Peter Barth - sax, flute & vocals, Jor Hahnfeld - drums and Thomas Holm - drums. Just glad that I got to listen to a borrowed copy of this title."
3,Great insight into how this team was put together and inside the locker room.,"If you are interested in how the Red Wings put together their all-star hockey team. This is a good book. It is interesting to see how the players intereact with the coaching staff and each other off the ice.It is a difficult read though because it is written in sort of a ""random"" mode. Do not really know what the book is supposed to be as it seems like a game play by play at points and them seems like a general manager/player issue play by play.Almost like a bunch of news articles put together into a book with no clear thread to hang onto throughout. Less a story than an insider recounting of events.But, if you like the Wings this is an interesting read."
2,Meh,"I was really looking forward to this book, but it was a letdown. As others have said, it's mostly just a recap of published news stories and box scores. There's very little relevant ""inside"" stuff here."
5,Really fun Ska,"This is my first Ska disk and it really upbeat and fun. Makes the work day go by very quickly. Cool songs, cool beats."
5,Great!!! but not perfect,"This is a scary movie. Milo has what you need, and it is different from all the other slasher films. It is really good. It has scary music, a creepy kid with a creepy voice, and is authenticly scary. Rent it."
4,Thorough and strong on native instruments...,"Encyclopedia showing every musical instrument you can think of, from its primitive origins to modern orchestral versions. No photos, but good detailed drawings that show multiple variations of native instruments. Minimal but clear discussion on construction, method of playing, sound production etc. Attractive layout, thorough and apparently scholarly. Originally British, published in 1976."
2,Save your money!!,"i read all of the short stories in this book and was severly dissapointed, 95% of them had nothing to do with the crow. most of these stories are good, but they don't belong under the title of the crow. the book is an ok read if you are bored and have nothing else that you haven't read already. the very few good stories are few and far between. i was usually left with the feeling of ""did i just miss something? what in the world does this have to do with the crow and eternal love?"" i've read much better stories on the fan fiction archive. if you must purchase this book, wait till you can get in paperback, or even better, the bargin bin!!"
3,"A good combination of art, poetry & shorts","This O'Barr and Kramer edited book offers a unique blend of art, poetic verse, and short stories, combined into one volume. O'Barr contributes to all three mediums. His story, ""Spooky"", is a disappointment. O'Barr uses the same ""guy and woman get killed by gang and guy comes back"" story. It would have been nice to see him use another set of circumstances, perhaps even using a female avatar since he has been reported to be a very big proponet of one making it to the bigscreen. There is more potential original story in his ""October"" storyboard that was shown in the last KSP Crow comic. All in all the other stories are good, Chet Williamson as always spins a very good tale. A warning, not all of the stories use the Crow premise. They are more a collection of pain, suffering and revenge, than specific stories in the Crow arena. You must enjoy dark stories for this book to keep your eyes from closing. For those of us that do like them, it is a good read."
4,A good read for Crow or horror fans,"I wasn't at all dissapointed that all the stories did not directly deal with the crow- they were a wonderful collection of stories about pain, fear, loss, revenge and of course love. I am sorry to hear that ""The Real Thing"" was not in the paperback edition, I thought it was a great story. I also loved ""Wings Burnt Black"". Now that I think of it I love too many of the stories to mention them all... you won't be dissapointed if you buy this one.(for crow and horror fans only)"
4,works good but,"I install cabinets for a living, so I like to buy tools that will last which is why I chose Bosch, the saw works great making nice steady cuts. The plastic boot that was supplied for the base had rough edges which will gouge up any finish the cord is too long if youwant to use the case.The body is very long making it tough to use in confined spaces, still haven't gotten use to the always on feature, meaning switch on or switch off, no trigger."
5,I wish I could give it 6 stars!!,I have had this saw for nearly a year now and every time I use it I'm blown away with how great it feels. The cutting action is so smooth and the saw is well balanced making it very easy to control. I use mine often and it hasn't missed a beat!
5,Love to cut,"If you are reading this review, you probably already like to work on household projects; but, this saw makes you really look forward to them. I have used this to cut all kinds of materials in several projects. There are many blades available and this cuts straight with no vibrations. I had previously bought a Skil jigsaw for half the price at a box store and it lasted me a year or two. It is obvious that this jigsaw will be around a while. The cord is extra long so you can move around a bit without dragging an extension cord with you. It took a little while to get used to but I am a big fan of the barrel grip now."
3,A mixed bag...,"The idea of a self-performing magic book is a nice one. To be sure, this book is cleverly designed.However, the tricks are a mixed bag... Some are ingeniously designed; others entail simple arithmetic tricks (that even a ten year old could work out)."
1,Not Worth The money,"Bought this book, thought it would be cool, but I feet like I wasted my money. The tricks were childish and not hard to figure out."
5,Happy,I am very pleased with my purchase and the ease of the transaction. This item arrived in great condition and is exactly as advertised.Thank you very much.
3,Interesting story...poor story teller,"Moore's story is a fascinating one without a doubt. If for no other reason, I'd recommend you buy and read the book simply to inspire yourself to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip as he did. However, throughout the book, I found myself picturing Moore simply transcribing his travel logs onto a laptop in a weekend and calling it a book.The book reads like a story you would expect a good friend (albeit an intelligent and witty friend) to tell you about their trip; the stories only grab you where the situation is one that would capture your imagination even if it were being told on public radio. The writing itself fails to bring the situations to life and wrap your imagination up in the surroundings like so many other great travel writers are able to do. It's clear that Moore's trip was fascinating, but his failure to develop scenes, create context, develop a story line that reads like a novel rather than a travel log are what prevents this book from being great."
2,To Silly To Be Funny!!!,"Just pathetic!...Way over the top comedy that just becomes stupid, added with annoying over-the-top acting. Katrina Kaif again does the same wooden acting as she does in ever other film she appears in. No substance, silly story, predictable acting esp by Katrina Kaif - Avoid!...Only thing decent is the soundtrack."
4,"fun, but within limits","Wish I knew the disc had to be put in each time I wanted to play. But laziness aside (although a bit of a bother) the game is good to pass the time, and harmless fun. Like the bonus rounds best."
1,Slots from Bally Gaming DUD,"This game has no install wizard and no uninstall. It says compatible with Windows 98 and ME. When I loaded it on my computer Windows ME, it would not work. MShell21.DLL lobby error. Tried to uninstall and it uninstalled components of other programs on my computer, which then totally crashed. Tried to load it on another computer using Windows 98, still would not work. Contacted Masque, they had me return the product for a refund. I think there are bugs in this program. Buyer Beware."
1,This game CD is a hassle to play.,"After I installed the ""Slots from Bally Gaming"" on my had hard drive, I discovered that I can't play the games unless the CD in inserted into my computer. I found out from Masque Support that the CD is copy protected and must be in the CD drive to play the game. To me, that is too much of a hassle. Also the slot games are very slow to show the winning line. This game is going into a Yard Sale or going to Good Will. Don't waist your money on this Slot Game CD."
5,Almost as fun as Vegas,"Like the slots, but hate to lose $ ?This is the best thing to come along since sliced bread. Better. It recreates your finest moments in Vegas (or wherever); I even won a jackpot that required an ""attendant""...great fun!The bonus rounds are believable; the graphics are incredible.The only thing missing is a cocktail person bringing me free drinks."
3,Great Game... Outdated Software... :/,"Game was a blast, but it crashed a couple times and I lost all of the progress. It said it was a disc error so I don't think it was my computer."
2,Great quality construction BUT...,"The quality of construction on this item is great. It's sturdy, durable & you don't have to worry it'll fall apart. I like the material it's made out of, and the film strap works really well. So that is why I gave it 5 stars.I personally don't think it's the most comfortable camera bag I have used. It's a bit awkward to wear on your hip & over the shoulder.There are quite a few downsides to this product. My Diana Mini doesn't fit. I literally have to squeeze it in, and to get it in I cannot have the ""wallet"" in there, and the lens cap cannot be on the camera. I contacted LOMO before purchasing & they said it would be no problem to get a mini in there. Also the Diana flash barely fits, but it's possible.I bought this to take to Vegas & to be able to transport my camera through airports. I wish I hadn't...it would of been another $30+ I could of spent on the trip. Oh well, live & learn."
2,"great, concise, BUT.....","If any book calls for photos, this book is it! No photos?!? There is a photographers credit but no photos, what a missed opportunity."
1,Incomprehensible dreck!,This is probably the worst piece of journalism I have ever read. It doesn't even seem like the author was actually in Iraq! It is poorly-written and demonstrates zero knowledge of Middle East politics. It looks to me as if she wrote the book just to make a buck. This author should stay focused on her main career: writing bad children's books.
2,If you are deaf this is great.,"So excited about this item. Everything in one unit is great. All would be perfect but for an audible hiss or static which is present even when nothing is actually playing. You can hear it when the cd is playing as well. The noise blends in with radio, tape, and record playing to become part of the background noise. When I hit the mute button, you hear the hiss. When the music is low, the hissing overwhelmes the music. If you are going deaf, you may not notice the hiss. I am not deaf, and I returned it. I don't know what I am going to do to replace the system. I was really excited about it."
5,Rocky Tshirt,Great purchase. Wished there were more sizes. Its is made from a nice thicker cotton material. Doesn't feel like cheap fabric. Thanks for the product!P.S. The seller's website isn't very easy to navigate and upload. But they have some really nice selection of apparel.
5,Cool Factor,I got this as a gift for my dad. He is an avid reader and Louis L'Amour is his favorite. I was worried that he would be embarrassed by the fact that it is getting hard for him to see the print in the books but when he saw it was narrated by all his favorite country singers he was thrilled with it. It is a nice presentation (it comes in a wood box) and with all the big name country stars it gives it a 'cool' factor.
4,Leatherman Juice XE6,Great Product. I would recomend for anyone who needs a pocket knife with some extra power. I really like all the extra essentials. I have used each tool with much success. Great purchase.
3,Very useful but not durable,"When I did a lot of work on sailboats, this was the tool I carried with me everywhere I went. It was extremely useful in that you could use it to make a huge range of minor repairs. The only problem is that the inside parts of the tool fall out eventually, causing some of the tools to not lock into place. I have had to send it in twice to be replaced under Leatherman's 25-year warranty. So it is a useful tool and the warranty on it is great, but it would be nice to not have to use the warranty as much."
3,heavy,"So this band is EXTREMELY heavy. Full of breakdowns, double bass, and low end that will crush your head. But dont get me wrong, they are playing tough-guy hardcore, and it gets very repetitive after a couple of listens. Dont get me wrong on that either, because when youre in the mood to move like a madman they are the perfect band for that. Put on your dancing shoes, and get ready to stomp."
2,Nice Product Lousy Shipping,"Product is nice, just as advertised. Shipping of product is terrible. 2 Days late when I paid for the best and most expensive shipping. Shipping detail is not accurate for tracking either. Goodluck!!"
1,AWFUL,Don't waste your money or time - complete rip off of a download the sims starts in 1960 UGH - UNINSTALLED for sure!
4,"Great binoculars, horrible strap","I got these binoculars for whale watching and the optics are really nice. Very bright compared to my Pentax binoculars. Because of the size, they are also easier to keep steady than my smaller Pentax binoculars.The major issue that I have is the strap. The strap came undone and my binoculars hit the ground! Luckily they are armored and the only thing that got scuffed up was the plastic eye cover. I couldn't get the strap to stay attached to the binoculars by themselves. I eventually had to wrap scotch tape around the straps (the only tape I had access to) in order to keep the strap from sliding free of the plastic clip.Lastly, the binoculars are olive green and not black as pictured."
5,Patriotic,Good selection of patriotic songs. As always those singers could really sing good.Wish we had more singers you could understand the words they sang.
1,A disgrace.,"It pains me to see Oscar Wilde used as a vessel through which ultra-Christian values are forced. I believe another reviewer mentioned ""De Profundis,"" and I agree entirely. Wilde was most definitely not a superficial, pleasure-seeking Victorian dandy; if you read nearly anything written after his imprisonment, it becomes quite apparent that he was anything but shallow. It's a terrible iniquity to characterize a man by the mask he wore instead of the person he really was."
2,"Great book, bad translation","Aristotle's Ethics is an excellent philosphical read and gives great insight into both greek philosphy and the history of philosphy. All of the above review are correct, my only concern, and the reason why I gave it a low rating, is that the translation is terrible in this version. It is meant to be a simple and easy to understand version. For more serious students, I would stick to more scholary versions."
1,He's out of touch,"I found this book extremely tedious and pointless. I don't see Aristotle's convoluted ""ethical"" theories having any relevance at all to the world today. He might think that he knows how people ought to live their lives, but he doesn't have much of a clue. All in all, a wase of time."
1,Poorly organized,"The author has made a very interesting collection of words whose origins conflict with the current meaning of those words, often diametrically opposite to their current meaning. He explains shifts in meaning well, but could often do more in the way of explaining the words' origins. The book's chapters are categories, e.g. foodstuffs, but the book's principal weakness is that the words are not alphabetized within their categories and each entry could be about twice as long; too much of the story is omitted."
4,Very Fun but....,"the game is a very fun game with some humor in the dialogues i love how you can unlock weapons,characters and pictures not to menton the music from the game and sounds from it the game itself is quite short but thats what i expect ""nightmare"" the ultimate diffulcultie (have to unlock) is for. i have seen the movie the game does have some parts from the movie that werent there (like the wheel scene i wanted to do that part) and the part where will and bootstrap play agianst davy jones in liar dice but overall i thought it was a pretty fun game"
1,"If 'unuseful' were a word, I'd use it.","I am a fashion designer who was looking for some good resource books to help with figure-appropriate designs. I came across this book after a long search and thought I had found gold. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. I was really disappointed with the line sketches used to explain clothing choices and found those designs to be VERY outdated- especially considering the second printing was in 2002. For example, I could not disagree more with the advice for rectangular-shaped women- that they should opt for sack dresses that ignore the waist, rather than trying to create one.The chapters on jewlery choices and color charts were equally useless.I would not recommend this book to any fashion designer looking for figure-flattering design elements. ""Dress Your Best"" by Stacy London and Clinton Kelly is by far a better choice- especially considering the price."
3,Little piece of history,This book was just that! A little piece of history. I especially enjoyed the actual letters that were in the book. It definitely showed a different side to plantation life
5,POWER PACKED WITH GREAT IDEAS!!!!!!,LONA KERZMAN WRITES WITH KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THIS INDUSTRY. SHE IS FULL OF WONDERFUL IDEAS THAT REALLY WORK!!! TRUST ME I HAVE USED MANY OF HER TECHNIQUES. I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL MORE BOOKS TO GIVE TO MY AGENTS. POWER PACKED INFORMATION!
1,Not one size fits all or even any,These are VERY small. I wear a 8.5 shoe and these were so tight that they hurt my toes. They run Very SMALL so be sure when you order them.
3,THOSE SOULFUL PHILLY SOUNDS,"First of all, by all means anyone who has listened to soul music in the 1970's or from the 1970's will read the song list of any CD stating various Artists of Philadelphia (curiosity). In this Sony Special project are basic essentials, no surprises.My only criticism is the choice of too many easy to find O'Jays and Harold Melvin cutts that are included here, truly basics. Another criticism is that the complilation should have included more Intruders song. The Intruders paved the way for the Philly sound and should be hailed in such regards. What's a philly compilation without 'Cowboys to Girls' and 'Together (How happy we'll be)' by the Intruders? It's a no no!"
4,"Complete dictionary, Used books rule!","For a first year accounting student, this book offers seemingly complete access to commonly used accounting terms."
4,team sleep,"This album is excellent. It angers me to read reviews that say ""this is not the deftones."" Yes i agree that this album definietly is not the Deftones, but that is not a reason to criticize this album. Team Sleep is something completely experimental and different than most other acts in the music scene today. Listeners have to also think of them as ""Team Sleep the band"" not ""Team Sleep the side project of Chino Moreno of the Deftones. It is very dark and chilling but in a very good way. This album is not for everyone, obviously.Highlight tracks:ever (foreign flag), blvd. nights, ever since world war I"
4,"An album that relaxes, yet entices....","I really enjoyed this album because it definitely reminded me of the White Pony album. Chino sounds so relaxed, with the exception of King Diamond and Boulevard Nights, and each song drifts into the other with grace instead of a stumble, which bothered me about the last Deftones album. I shouldn't compare these two bands, because they are extremely different. However, I felt that this album was a very impressive debut from what will hopefully become a pretty popular alternative band. I am excited about future projects, and hopefully Team Sleep will gain a larger fan base as time progresses."
2,Don't Get Your Hopes Up....,"Okay...not that I expected this album to be a collection of those amazingly haunting ""softer"" Deftones songs, but I'm still not feelin' it. Most of the songs lack any kind of feeling and emotion, and seem to get lost within themselves. There are a few songs on here worth hearing, so I'd look for a good deal on a used CD."
2,Not That Great,"I can't believe all the 5-star reviews for this tool. I almost hesitate to use the pliers because it's really easy to pinch your finger between the two handles when you squeeze them together. I've gotten blood-blisters more times than I care to count. On well-designed pliers, the handles don't come completely together when you squeeze them, just for this reason. Even if you hold it carefully, the handles are too short to give you very much leverage. Then there are the various tools--of the 6 stored in the handles, three of them are little more than flat-head screwdrivers of various sizes. Hopefully you never need a Phillips-head! Forget trying to use the wire cutters. Even if you're successful it's impossible to finish the cut without pinching your finger. The knife is OK--sharp and solid, and the file seems useful. But if you're going to use the pliers, be sure to wear a glove."
2,Bad reproduction of superb material,"I awaited months for this collection and I was truly desappointed by the awful job Marvel Comics did of reproducing these gems.First, the paper: who said glossy paper was better quality? It makes the colors pop out way too much. The original colors were meant for a more absorbing paper. When printed on the glossy stock they just scream.Second: the gorgeous inking by the imcomparable Joe Sinnot is totally destroyed by the abysmal reproduction.These original comics are some of the absolute best ever. They need to be preserved for history's sake. I know Marvel can do better than that...This is why this book is rated 2 stars instead of the five stars the original material deserves."
2,"Very nice seat, frustrating handle","We had purchased this seat for our daughter before she was born. We feel that it is very safe and she is comfortable in it. We also liked that we could buy an additional base since we have two cars. It snaps in and out of the bases, shopping carts and the sit and stand stroller we also purchased very easily. My complaint is that it is very hard to depress the release buttons to move the handle. It seems the longer we use it, the harder it gets. I have two other friends with the same seat and the same complaint. It is very frustrating and after just 3 months, I am looking to purchase a new seat."
3,Thin,"A minor work by Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard. Two old masters, Atzbacher and Reger, meet in Vienna's Kunsthistorisches museum, as is their daily habit, to reflect on the decline of modern European culture. Bernhard proceeds in his typically famous style-with enormously winding sentences that fill pages with complaints, anecdotes, commentaries, and rants. This little book is much more traditional than his finer novels, and one gets the impression that it was underdeveloped in its conception. We find endlessly repetitious complaints about Vienna's bourgeoisie and its anti-intellectualism. Yet there is none of the urgency we find with the great characters developed in Der Untergeher or Correction. A slim achievement."
1,Crap,Didn't work. There was something wrong with the bearings massive vibrations the slowed it down. Had to send it back.
3,Misleading,The photo and large print on the box lead the buyer to believe that the VHS tape focuses primarily on the Coneheads. Not so. There is a bunch of other stuff--especially musical guest appearances--that doubles the length of the tape. The Conehead sketches are good as expected.
5,I'm in Love!,"I saw Petty Booka in concert for the first time a few days ago, and I am SMITTEN. This ukulele duo is just so good and so charming, one can't help but fall in love with their note perfect harmonies Hawaiian style! I was really excited to get this CD, which is a collection of the best tracks from Petty Booka's many, many Japanese releases, plus two exclusive, never before released songs ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"" and ""Let's Talk Dirty in Hawaiian."" Backed by an ace band of Island style musicians playing slack key guitar, Hawaiian steel, and other authentic instruments, the Petty Booka girls do amazingly adorable versions of songs ranging from Tom Waits' ""Hang Down Your Head"" to Blondie's hit ""The Tide is High"" to Gomez' ""Whipping Picadilly"" plus ukulele standards like ""Sophisticated Hula."" Petty Booka is so charming and so GOOD, you can't help but love them!!"
3,cookies,Always love the cookies...but they are individually wrapped and that is way too much packaging to be wasting.
4,"Same Satire, new topic","It is a pretty good little book in the same line of other ""Worst Case Scenario Guide of...."" Nothing spectacular, but if you like the other books, you will enjoy this one."
4,Edgier Eliza better,"Note to Roy Castleberry...there's no such word as ""monotonal."" It's nice to hear a folk singer sing topical songs again; especially one like Eliza who has the vocal and emotional range to handle the material. This CD is reminiscent of the folk music from the 60's--it touches your heart and makes you think."
3,"It's OK. If your want nice slow mood cuddling music, this is great","The lady is a monotone singer but good, you just have to really be in a kicked back mode to listen to herI am a solid lover of Female Jazz and Blues singers.She kinda comes close.....If you have that someone special with that special nightShe will help light your fire.She is talented in her Genre......"
1,serious design flaws,"My computer exceeds system requirements for the game and I could barely get passed the intro screen before I got kicked back to my desktop. I tried reinstalling without any positive success and have neither the time or energy to mess with patches or customer support (based on earlier reviews it sounds like it would'nt do much good anyway). No, I think I will just return this ""game"" and avoid future Dreamcatcher titles."
5,Please republish this winner,"This is a monumental novel that was a bit daunting when I saw the size of it. But I became totally immersed in the historical period and the story, and was really sorry to come to the end of it. I felt sort of lost, without another book worthy of this one to start on! That was last year--now I want to own the book ( the trilogy) so I can dive in again and re-read parts of it. ( I may just start over at page one!) I hope the publisher will reprint this great book."
5,Great DVD,This is a great DVD set. Around 13 hours of watching Arino challenge himself does not get old but gets better. Support this release so Discotek will license more of Arino's gruelling game challenges.
2,Mostly of historical interest,"This is probably the finest joint effort from John and Beverley Martyn, before he launched into a meteoric solo career that eventually crashed into drug addiction. Most of it is forgettable folk-rock -- but the title track (the final one on the album) is John Martyn as we know and love him, with gravelly, meditative vocals and pyrotechnical guitar work. I don't say the whole album is worth buying for this one track, but it IS pretty impressive!"
4,Good & Worthful book,Hi this is the best book for struts.the author tries to explain all topics in easy way so that a beginer to struts can understand.good chapters on tag libraries.
2,"Lacks Depth, Found Printing Mistakes","The book starts with good introduction to Struts basics but lacks depth and explanation. In addition to that I found some printing mistakes in some of the examples in LookupDispathAction and MappingDispatchAction classes. I saw such mistakes somewhere else also in the book. The Tiles chapter does not cover some of the basic things, which someone new to Tiles should know.Overall I do not think I would recommend this book for struts. I liked the book Struts in Action: Building Web Applications with the Leading Java Framework by Ted Husted and Struts authors, which covers the nitty gritties on every struts topic and is more thorough."
5,Best enjoyed by people born before 1949,"And I was born 6 August 1949. I enjoyed the hell out of this program.TV -- as we know it -- was born in 1939: A World Fair somewhere, probablyNew York. Because of WWII, Atomic Bombs, and Aliens being hidden in NewMexico, it wasn't popularized until 1949.If you don't care about the '30s, '40s. and '50s, you certainly won't beinterested in THIS either.If so, enjoy!"
2,GO BACK AND READ THE FIRST REVIEW _ HE'S RIGHT!,STOP right here. It's a waste of time to go any further. The first review is SO right on! This DVD is much more about Vaudeville than TV (Period)
4,Works but a bit flimsy,I would have given the product a 5 star review if it didn't squeak when opened. Worth the price.
3,"It's okay - It is a little dificult for me to see all of the ties, however, it is better than having them on a hanger.","It's okay - It is a little dificult for me to see all of the ties, however, it is better than having them on a hanger."
2,Serious design flaw,"This is a great idea although it does seem flimsy. The worst part is the way it attaches to the wire shelf. It uses spring clips which become un-clipped if you slide clothing across the shelf above it. The clothing snags the clip and releases the entire unit sending it, your belts, and ties crashing to the bottom of the closet."
1,"Don't waste your money, or your time","All the negative reviews on this movie are correct. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the video. This video does not deserve ANY stars, the filmmakers falsely presented the idea of ""being out there."" Looks more like they went out for the day, and came back home. The music sucked and the movie consisted of people being interviewed on a crowded beach somewhere in the Bahamas--no open water video footage."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"If you're planning on Cruising, or just wishful thinking, this is the DVD that will answer some questions, bring up others and make you want to sail off to Margaritaville!"
1,TO BE CLEAR,I am returning this item. It was very expensive to begin with to NOT have the TRAY INCLUDED as clearly pictured. DECEIVING. DISAPPOINTED.
4,Functional Dish Rack,"I love that it is stainless steel (everything except the separate bottom tray) so it will not rust. Looks great on my stainless steel topped island, blends right in. The bottom tray should have an area for the water to drain into the sink because it does show water marks and needs to be wiped quite often to prevent them. You do not have to use the tray though because it is not attached. This rack is not meant for a lot of large items such as pots & pans, but works fine for small things that I do not put in the dishwasher. Works for this family of two."
4,the group slides but still shines,"After four great discs in a row aerosmith came out with this one which is a disapointment in comparison to what came before , but it's still a good disc.It still has alot of great music on here and is far above their next three studio discs for sure. ""Draw the line"" and 'kings and queens' and 'bright light fright' are great 70's metal all the way. So while drugs were destroying these guys at the time they still were burning and that's why this is still a aerosmith fave for me to this day. There are no bad songs on here; if you love aerosmith."
3,"Not a Great, but Still Good (3.5 stars)","Coming on the heels of Aerosmith's best albums, Toys in the Attic and Rocks, Draw the Line is a somewhat overlooked piece of the band's catalog. It is, however, a strong album, more reminiscent of their earliest work than either Toys or Rocks, and fairly stripped down.It's worth owning simply for the part in the title track where Tyler's vocals suddenly reach their screeching best."
2,I used this on its own,"I used this product on its own, though many people stated its good to use with the NO-Explode i already had left over creatine and didn't want to by more yet. the product states to take on an empty stomach i found this weird because i was always told never take any pill on an empty stomach but i did as it said and found that when i did this i felt discomfort in my stomach. i stopped taking the product for a week and the discomfort went away then i just ate before taking it and there was no discomfort. as for the results my veins did bulge faster and stayed out longer but honestly i did not notice much of a difference in my workout as in being able to do more reps."
1,very bad printing,very very bad printing. do not buy it. waste moneyvery very bad printing. do not buy it. waste money
4,"well, this made me hot!","seriously, this is better than porn i've seen. read it on a loooong plane ride. Made me...feel things haha!!!!!!!! recommend."
2,"Pretty to look at, not so easy to play","The Irish Rosewood Flute is beautiful to look at but not that easy to play. The E note is particularly weak and whispy sounding and the tuning is not very good from note to note. I find I have to make a lot of note by not adjustment to play something in tune. I pretty much have stopped playing the Irish Rosewood Flute, but did not return it because I enjoy the look of it where it rests in my study."
1,"Not as bad as ""Clumsy"" bust still bad",Uninteresting and overrated. Do not get this unless you are already familiar with Jeffrey Brown. I got all his stuff on a recommendation and it was all horrible.
3,Sound Quality Not That Great,I didn't think that the sound was all that great on this CD. You would think that a band that is as professional as Third Day would have more professional sound people. They were recording this at a live concert but only one song sounds good enough to be listenable.An average project at best. The first offerings album was MUCH better.
4,worship on valium,"Third Day is a gifted band. Their songs here are well crafted, and there is no denying their passion. It shines through in the music and also through the sleeve notes that precede each track. Unlike many Christian bands today, they have a sound that is consistent and instantly recognizable.But, boy, I wish they would up the tempo a bit. Even with strong lyrics and solid music, the plodding tempo of most of these songs puts me to sleep. Hey, guys, this is a worship album, not a collection of lullabies.If you consider worship to be a solemn, cerebral exploration of God's greatness, then this is the CD for you. If, however, you prefer to jump up and down, wave your arms in the air and celebrate, you'll be disappointed by this offering.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
4,Cursed One,Songs Include : Polygraph / God And Country / Promised Land / Bloody Mary / Nineteen Seventy Four 1974 / Negative Two Point Five / Guilt Parade - Written By The Swarm / Another Day / Opposable Thumbs / Pariah
4,excellent series,"The final book in the Farseer Trilogy provides an excellent finish to a wonderful series. The build up to a dramatic climax is true to the best fantasy traditions. Many of the unanswered questions raised in the first two books of the series are left unresolved until the conclusion of the story creating a page turning frenzy.One criticism is the obvious lead into other series by leaving certain matters hanging. This is no real criticism, however, as it just means that I get to read more books by this excellent author."
4,"travelogue, but still a good book","While I enjoyed this book, it was probably the weakest in the series. It read more like a travelogue for much of the story as we find Fitz journeying to find Verity. I didn't feel the excitement and page turning action/intrigue that I felt from book 2. This one had alot of self pity, alot of Fitz dreaming about others and Fitz just wishing he didn't have to do what he was stuck doing.I have to agree with what most have said about the ending. Hobbs really ties it all up in a nice tight summary with about 20 pages left. You don't get any of the confrontation you would have expected. It felt like she had run out of time and just needed to close all those plot lines and move on. I would have liked her to have cut about 100+ pages of travel and focus on that instead.Still, this is fantasy writing head and shoulders above most. The characters are drawn well and the story is told well."
4,"Good, but not as good","This is a very well-written, emotionally complex book. It really does [draw] you in, and I think the character development is beautifully done.However, I must admit that I enjoyed the first two books better. I really liked reading about all the court intrigue around Buckkeep and assasinations and such, so when ""Assassin's Quest"" took a more mythical turn with all the dragons, I was caught a bit off guard. That said, it is still a great book."
2,Disappointing Ending to a Decent Series,"I must agree with what a lot of the other people have said about this book. The author victimizes the main character way too much, makes Regal way too evil. They make everything go wrong for him, I seriously think it would've been a happier book if the main character died. *SPOILERS AHEAD* Then at least his heart wouldn't have been broken. The kings and princes demand too much from him, the characters become suddenly stupid after the first book. In the 3rd especially everyone is stupid, everyone is willing to believe the propaganda, even the stupidest lies. Fitz himself turns into a blundering idiot who falls into traps too often. *SPOILERS OVER* I already got the first book of another of her series (I got it before reading the 3rd book) but I am wary to read it because I don't wish to be so disappointed by later books in the series. IF YOU LIKE A TRAGEDY THIS BOOK IS PERFECT FOR YOU."
3,mixed feelings,"I feel that I have mixed feelings about this book. I really enjoyed the first two, and the third was also good, but too long and confusing near the end. The one thing that i loved most about the books was The Fool. He kept you laughing, and kept the book interesting with his colourful jibes. What did his kiss with fitz mean at the end? many unanswered questions. I think that molly with Burrich is gross, but you almost knew that it was coming. I loved some of the other characters as well, like patience and chade, or even regal, but found that fitz's character, while good, was somewhat lacking and confusing. overall, a good series but overshadowed by many better books that I have read."
5,One of the best stories I've ever read.,"If you are looking for nonstop slugfests between wizards and warriors and monsters, the Farseer trilogy may not be the fantasy for you. If you are looking for a well-written story with great characters and heart-wrenching drama, told from an unsung hero's point of view (and add in some magic, just a few battles, and a dragon or two at the very end), then I think you will love these three books as much as I did. Make sure you have plenty of time to put aside for this, so you can read it slowly and enjoy it to it's fullest."
4,WHAT HAPPENED!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"""Assassin's Quest"" must *not* be the end to this amazing series (I'm sorry but I'm in denial). I have so many questions still unanswered!! I think Miss Hobb is taking the ""keep your audience wanting for more"" bit a little too far.Still, Hobb continues to write in a masterful manner. Her characters are dynamic and life-like. This is trully a work of art. I just wish there's a book four (fingers crossed)"
2,Worst Ending Ever,"The first book of the trilogy is very good with characters that are well developed and scenery that is well described leaving a person with a scense of being part of the story. The second book of the trilogy starts the decline and is not as enthralling as the first.As for the third book of the trilogy, the first half was slow and the last half was awful. I almost stopped reading during the last fifty pages, but I trudged on. I have Never read an ending as truly gut wrenching as the end of this trilogy. Much of it didn't even flow with the story."
4,A Worthy Read With A Disappointing Ending,"Robin Hobb takes the time to pull the reader deep into the lives of her characters. I was more invested in the characters of these books than anything I have previously read. I felt the pain and disappointment of the main character as personal attacks. I was right with him through each trial and heartache and on to eventual redemption. Professional reviewers have commented that these books were too long. I think that the investment pays off. Except. This is another of those books where you are really invested and the plot is thick and you know it's the last book and you look in horror to realize that there is only 15 pages left. Someone either got bored or ran into a deadline. I agree with a number of other reviewers. The end was sloppy and unsatisfying. After all the evolution and growth the main character goes through, the ending truly belies the magnitude of the character's strength and accomplishments."
2,TTS disabled,Love the books but TTS not enabled is a big no no ... Voice acting isn't the same it distracts from the story. I'd probably pay the extra 8 bucks if I had to if I could turn on the voice...Guess it just sucks to be me /w 3 learning disabilities
5,Fun faces!,"At first I was disappointed that this book was a small board book, but my kids liked it so much I got over that quickly. It was in my almost 2 yr old daughters stocking Christmas morning and she kept opening it and laughing, even slapping the floor! Teaches emotions and expressions too."
1,Poor construction and poor customer service,"My daughter used this umbrella 4 or 5 times before one of the metal struts detached from the umbrella ribs, making it unusable. And these were gentle uses!I contacted the company, as I'd gotten it directly from Kidorable. They told me they'd be happy to replace it, if I mailed it back to them at my own expense. Cost of shipping tube, plus cost of first-class postage, was over $8, for a $14 umbrella.Also, it's cute, but TINY!"
3,Need a little help,"These need a little help from their friends. Their friends the staples, that is. By themselves, they will bend, do yoga, perhaps even dance the fandango. I had to use staples to stabilize them. Stretchers, like nostalgia, are not what they used to be."
1,Did not work for me,"Either it was not compatible with an Abit K7A motherboard, or was DOA. I don't have the means or the time to test. I returned it. I'm just happy it didn't fry my mobo."
3,Good Picture taking. Forget Video editting,This camera so far takes pretty good pictures. I think my 35 mm takes better shots but this one does well. You can access the photos with Windows XP and bypass the Kodak software which I think is great because I think that the Kodak software is not very good.What I was disappointed with is the video function. You can take 1 min of video with sound which is great. But the software Kodak gives does not allow you to edit it. The video function is also not compatible with windows xp. You can only use QuickTime to view. And so far from what I researched have to buy the quicktime pro to edit or switch formats. I was going to buy adobe photoshop 2.0 to edit video but from what I understand adobe photoshop 2.0 is not compatible with the video from this camera. It is like Kodak just threw in the video function to give some more sell power but didn't spend enough time to make it worthwhile.
1,BAD Investment....,After only 1 month my camera started to give me troubles: It does not work with the external memory ONLY the internal. DONT BUY IT!!
3,"Fun, but not floor friendly","My sister-in-law gave us this toy, since her youngest had outgrown it and I have a nearly one year old daughter. Unfortunately, my big girls (6 and 4) couldn't resist taking turns riding it and pushing each other around--and the hard plastic wheels left permanent scuff marks all over my laminate flooring. Laminate is super durable--this car is literally the first thing ever to leave permanent damage and I've had these floors for three years. If you have only small children and no wood or laminate type floors, then I'd recommend it. Otherwise, maybe look for something with rubber wheels."
5,Best text for Qualified Retirement Plans.,I first used this book in 1978. It is by far the best text for Qualified Retirement Plans anywhere. I highly recommend it.
4,Bath tub for doll,This toy is absolutely loved. Has been quite frequently since it's arrival to the house.
4,great stuff!,A friend shared his bottle with me. Great flavor good heat. I have been eating it on everything lately.Dont forget that it was on your food and non chilli heads taste your food!!!! Just ordered some ghost pepper seeds!!!!!! Have fun
3,German at its best ...,"German at its best ... which is still German.I have a dozen of her albums - all in French.There is no comparison.On Rendezvous her voice is, as always, superb.The recording is technically fine.But, unless you love German, it is still in German.If you do like German, the album is an absolute treat.I bought this thinking it was French renditions just titled in German. Wrong.The title - Rendezvous - read quickly - seemed to be French. I forgot about the hyphen.So I have the lovely Mireille singing in German.And soon to be For Sale in English."
1,Beware,"The subtitle is ""A facing-pages translation into contemporary English"" and it is not a line by line translation, it simply has short scene summaries, a disappointment given this description. Also it would be more accurate to call this a pamphlet rather than a book since it is 30 pages of text and 10 pages of bibliography and appendices. I bought it to supplement classroom material and ironically found out that appearances are not reality!"
3,Could be better but it is a good start,It could include more details of historical productions... but it is a good starting point.
4,Very good and very simple!,I checked this book out from the library and I really love the simplicity of the recipes - especially the ease of mixing the flours in large batches ahead of time. I tried a couple of the recipes and they were absolutely yummy. I'm going to buy this book myself so I can have it on hand. I've been eating wheat free since July 2011.
2,book,The book was received in damaged condition the binding was falling apart and pages were coming out
5,An amazing work,"The one and only book about Vanport. I would give it 6 stars if I could. The story of the liberty ships, the workers, the tense war-time environment, the determination and sacrifice of the people who lived there. This book covers the extraordinary birth and violent death of Oregon's second-largest town; how it was wiped off the face of the Earth in a single day.The research is meticulous, the photographs astonishing. Many historic details are included, but the pace never drags. The positive and the negative are highlighted: Vanport did have racially integrated schools long before such things were federally mandated. But the racism of the times is not ignored. The book doesn't make judgments, just tells it like it was. The reader can decide if the story of Vanport can be considered Portland's shame, or Portland's triumph."
1,I am not pleased..,"This was the one gift that my son was the most excited about opening on Christmas morning. I was very upset to find that the steering gage did not work. It would go forward and back, but it would not turn right or left. I would like to have it replaced with one that works properly."
3,Expensive for What It is,"Purchased this bath tub based on a request made to Santa. I'm sure my daughter will enjoy it. However, per another review here, the quality of the product (design, materials, durability) is not worth the price listed here."
1,Life is too short to spend time on this book,"""Hippies"" is a poorly-written, mostly unbelievable plot vehicle for smarmy reminiscences about the late 60s and early 70s. There aren't a whole lot of hippies in it; mostly frat boys smoking dope, chasing skirts, and skirting involvement in the politics of the time. The dialog is wooden. Go listen to the Moody Blues, Procol Harem, Iron Butterfly, Janis Joplin or Bob Dylan music instead--time better spent."
4,Very Informative,"Very informative and a great style-- Sam Yulish, author of Where Have All the Hippies Gone?"
1,I didn't get it,"I was disappointed that Jedick took an inherently interesting topic and made it so uninteresting. The writing style he chose (grammatical and spelling errors, poor sentence structure, inane dialog) did not help this book's cause. In fact, I was never sure he CHOSE the style (as opposed to having it forced on him for not employing a proofreader).I attended KSU in 1970, and I couldn't finish the book. Huge disappointment."
4,business!,"This cd is the proper business. Its just ridiculously vibrant, rattlingly, soulful and mechanical all at once....with a lot of bass and toasting. A useful primer to some wicked tunage- when people wet themselves over the latest r and b producers' knobtwiddling, its good to be reminded how much more amazing and mental the future sounded 15 years ago. Ragga Twins stuff is interesting i guess historically, although I swear that rave music's many varied iterations had a lot more to do with incubating jungle than them two, though respect is due, and all that. Massive."
1,Beware,This item does not fit on a 5/8 arbor bolt. They should have been more descriptive. I will be trying to drill it out larger to allow it to fit on my Miter Saw. I'll update this review when i do it later today.The product itself seems to be well built.
1,You probably don't need this book.,"I read about this book in a magazine and was eager to get it. Being a first time home buyer/owner, I really thought it would be a useful tool. When it arrived I was very disappointed. 1/3 of the book is devoted to dreams and plans for your house (I already have a notebook for that) and the rest is for writing down information about appliances, paint, repairs, etc. I returned the book and will be starting a notebook. A 3-ring binder will suffice for me. However, for an unorganized person this book might be great."
4,Compliments to Zoo Med on customer service,"I can't comment on the light yet because it is brand new, but when this item arrived, one of the bracket screws was broken (the wide head snapped off in shipping). I was dreading packaging everything up and returning to Amazon, so I popped a quick email to Zoo Med and within a couple of hours I got a response and a replacement screw was mailed out.This may seem like a small thing, but I have had much less positive experiences with a number of other pet product vendors in the past, so I wanted to give them props!This light will be used in a 28 gallon bowfront, heavily planted in a soil substrate with no CO2 but some Flourish Excel dosing. I'll comment on success in a couple of months :)"
5,A small handbook to enlightenment,"This concise but profound book is a beautiful commentary by two contemporary Tibetan lamas on the centuries-old Indian and Tibetan teachings on ""lojong,"" or ""thought transformation."" The subjects include meditation on emptiness, generation of bodhicitta, and changing adverse circumstances into the path. This is one of the most practical and helpful books on Buddhist philosophy and practice that I have read."
2,Fidelity Problem ?? (MP3 version),"With some of these songs, the mid-range and bass are lacking. Sounds like the engineer for the MP3 version screwed up. I like a good bass guitar that is prominent when you hear these songs on the radio."
4,"One disc, 16 hits.","I do realize there's the 2-disc ""Chronicles"" collection, as well as others, but being a minor fan this made the most sense to me. It has most everything you've heard on the radio (hence the title), plus some. Included is ""Fly By Night"", ""Closer To The Heart"", ""Freewill"", ""New World Man"", and the popular ""Tom Sawyer"". Plus it ends with my favorite ""Time Stand Still"", with guest vocals from ""Aimee Mann"". The only thing I wish they had fit on is ""Show Don't Tell"", from the album ""Presto"". Some copies of this came with a bonus DVD with lyrics and 5 videos too. Overall, these songs are a real ""Rush"", and it's a great collection for the casual fan."
3,Just a Tease,"This compilation has the more well known stuff so it might be a good jump-in buy for the casual Rush fan. Problem is, I don't think I've ever met a ""casual Rush fan"". If you know the band's work, Chronicles is a better pick up. If you've heard a couple of songs on radion and want to learn more about their music, buy Moving Pictures, Exit Stage Left, Permanent Waves or Signals. If you are going to get into their music- you won't be disappointed by any of these and is money better spent. These are all good songs, but overall is little more than a teaser."
5,"Rush delivers, as usual!","I just popped the CD in and blasted it as loud as possible. Of course, we've heard all the songs before. But now, they just jump of the disk! It's especially gratifying to hear a track like ""Distant Early Warning"" sound so great, because on the original recording, it sounded like it was dragged through the mud. Everything is sharp, clear, and clean. I didn't think I would buy this, because I have every Rush album and I love every song they have ever done, and I was just getting it for the DVD. However, the sound is so bright, it's like falling in love all over again. Can't wait to watch the DVD!"
1,Why?,"This album has tracks which can be found on at least two other Rush retrospectives: ""Chronicles"" and the two ""Retrospective"" disks. And all of the videos on the DVD can be found on the ""Chronicles"" VHS or DVD. I would recommend keeping your money and buying a Rush gold disk or two..."
1,really bad!!!,"Huge Claypool and Primus fan. That's why I bought this album without hearing anything from it. I couldn't even get through the whole thing. I think I got a little past half way. Les and the boys must have been high on some kick ass acid when they recorded this! The music is all over the place. There is no flow, no rythum, it's like a real bad experimental jam session that they put on CD. Buckethead adds nothing. His guitar playing abillities are not even showcased here except for maybe on one song. Les has done this kinda way out there stuff before and I've never liked it but this is an entire album of it and it and it is impossible to get into."
1,Misleading title,"I think this book is mislabeled. It should be called the ""Stewart Swerdlow Story"" or ""The alien abduction of Stewart Swerdlow"". I bought this book because I enjoyed ""Montauk, Experiments in Time"" so much and was hoping this was a continuation of alien agenda, alien details, or expansion or continuation of the Montauk story with discussions of alien technology, alien life, alien pictures, alien physical details, or science learned. But all I get from someone with ""direct contact"" with numerous species of aliens is vague descriptions and passing comments about their agenda/science/life buried inbetween minute details of Steward's story (which I rather not know so much about). Steward may have higher I.Q. and be able to ""read"" people ( and I'm sure he is a great help to people) but it sounds like he is just as lost and easily confused as the rest of us. Sorry, this book is not worth the effort."
1,I think this is a disinformation hoax,"This book is an unbelievable account of life adventures of the author, who claims to be very special alien creation for the purpose of using his special structures (DNA, etc.) to create other life in the universe. And you have to understand, that he is so much more evolved that the rest of us.The author maybe a confused human being (programmed and controlled by very bad people). He may be sincere, but I don't think that he is a free person. This kind of fictions are usually used to discredit legitimate programmed individuals who break free from controlled hold, and those who help them. Besides the book is set heavy in occult, and have agenda to discredit GOD and His Word the Bible.It stinks."
1,Horrible,"If one was to believe anything at all by any of the Montauk books this book will make you once again a non-believer. It is simply the most ridiculous story about someones so-called alien abductions with absolutely no plausibility.Seriously i couldn't read it with a straight face and couldn't even finish it.I enjoyed the original Montauk Files and Montauk Project books 1 and 2. But this story simply is a way for the ""author"" to make money. These books should have stopped when there was still a slight degree of plausability to them, instead they insist on trying to make ridiculous connections to anything and everything into this so-called conspiracy story."
1,Bad Juicer and Bad Customer Service,"The motor on this juicer simply stopped working after just one year, Before that I was happy enough with it. I tried to contact Omega about it, since it was still under warranty. I emailed, called and left many messages. No one ever picked up, replied or returned my calls at any point. I will never buy another Omega product again. What good is a warranty when no one will make good on it or even answer the phone?"
3,Refurbished -It leaked bad,"I bought a Refurbished"" juicer.It worked fine,But leaked between the top and white band part!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please Dont Chance It !!!,"Purchased this juicer 2 weeks ago. The First day it worked great.Second day the motor would slow down and speed up no matter what Iwas juicing (90% of the time it was cucumbers and celery). The motorwould speed up and slow down even when I stopped feeding it. On the10th day after 2 carrotts and three stalks of celery it begain to makea very loud noise. I stopped it , cleaned it, checked everything as for asproper assembly, but alas no change. It is going back to amazon.I will never buy another product from Omega. A juicer is a simple productthere is no excuse for such slip shod manufacturing. I bought this product so I could have fresh juice not so I could develope a relationship with customer service. If you chance it (when it worked it worked good) SAVE THE BOXES youwill probably need them."
4,Motivator monitor,Once the parameters are set it's fine. You have to frequently monitor the steps while walking so that it is in fact recording. The belt grip is not adequate if one is not wearing a belt but just has an elastic or drawstring waistband. I've atached a reel belt clip that really grabs the waist band so it doesn't fall off and break. The talking mode is motivating and cute.
5,Most Durable Ride-On Car,"I purchased this for my little girl a week before her first birthday. We thought it would help her start walking a little. We were wrong, it helped her walk a lot. She loved it and pushed it around for 2 weeks before she ventured out on her own. She still likes to push it around even though she's practically running on her own. And loves to be pushed around on it."
2,"Not the toy pictured, and a nightmare to put together.","I bought this toy for my youngest grandchild for Christmas (I'm guessing at the ratings, since she hasn't received it yet). I started to put it together, but I didn't get very far: the parts were so ill-fitting that I didn't have the physical strength to do it. I got my son to help me, and it was a real struggle for him to get it together, even though he is strong and very handy. At one point we thought we'd have to send it back because we couldn't get a rod fastened from one end to the other. Now it's together (although I'm concerned that it won't be sturdy, given the barely connecting parts), and it's nothing like the racer pictured. It's blue with yellow and red, instead of all red, it doesn't have decals, and the shape is different. The box says ""Push & Ride Racer,"" but in fact the toy looks just like the Little Tikes Push & Ride Doll Walker also sold on Amazon. That's not what I wanted: I wanted the toy in the picture."
5,Definitely Worth It!,"My son received this for his first birthday and now almost 2 years later, he still plays with it. There has been no other toy that has kept his attention this long. Not only has he enjoyed it by himself, but he has also enjoyed ""pushing"" his friends around the house too. Great for indoors or outdoors - and I especially like that it doesn't make noise - something parents can appreciate!"
3,White Noise!,"I was very restless one evening and could not get to sleepso I thought I would try some thing to fill the time. Put this onand next thing I knew it was time to get up and start a new day! Fine ,Fine sleeping pill!!"
3,bible your god,time and time again he right about people take scripture wrong. the bible is not god nor is gods word without thought. satans greatest triumph is for you to read books like one timothy and believe in slavery and ruling women. get a life and the holy spirit by loving and learning unconditionally. this pleases your higher power not using the bible as a weapon or sheild for ignorance.
4,goid,"Good, Great product! I recommend it!Nice timing, great price, perfect for students budget. I do not regret my purchase"
5,Small and handy this quality tool is a great bargain,"This is a handy, little tool that easily fits into your pocket or on a key chain. Leatherman did a good job with the design, as it is small but very practical. Quality construction and easy to use. It's great for day-to-day jobs that a larger multi-tool may be an overkill."
4,Convenient tool,"For a small, light multi-tool, this Leatherman has been my favorite. Unlike the Gerber it replaced, all the tools come out without difficulty. The quality is nice and it's small/light enough to not be noticed in the pocket. That's why various airports have a collection of my old tools."
5,Much improved!,"I have two of the original small Leatherman's and this one is not only prettier, but easier for me to use since the tools open from the outside and the scissors which I use a lot work more smoothly. A pleasant surprise."
1,Sorry it didn't work...,"I don't understand how a garage remote system works.....I tried another before I purchased this one. It just didn't work with my garage. I don't think it is failure of this remote, it just didn't match the system. I was hoping it would work. I am not sure how to make sure if a remote works to your garage if the garage is not so popular brand. If somebody knows, please tell me! :("
1,Buy the Indexed version - too tough to navigate this one,The only way to navigate this version of the Kindle edition of Plato's Republic is by PAGING through it or searching for keywords you already know. Get the mobile version instead. It has a table of contents with working links.
5,The War Against America,"The WHITE KING AND THE DOCTOR, is not just a good book- it is an extremely important one. This is a book about real, contemporary bad guys- Usama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, Abou AL-Zarkawai- and the evil that is Al Qaeda. It is about the subversion of and ultimate goal of the destruction of America. How does one go about taking down a super power that cannot be conquered militarily? Author Lee Kessler tells us how, in this chilling and all-too-real story. She expertly weaves actual events into a suspense-filled thriller, with her own goal of alerting Americans to the dangerous game being played by our enemies. I love this book!"
3,A good synopsis...,Being a long time fan of Cat Stevens I find this live event to be a good snapshot of his early career. Though I would like more improvisation during the concert I know his music isn't too versatile by it's nature (except for maybe Foreigner Suite). I have his box set also and plan on downloading more of his music as I felt the box set left a lot out. But this live set is a good supplement when I just want to hear the highlights of his early career.
3,Crowd Noise a Major Distraction - Music Great,"I spent hours editing my wav files to eliminate annoying crowd lead-ins and fades..... and cut out Cat's insipid remarks.... Cat needs to stick to just music.... overall, my album is 8 minutes shorter and eminently more listenable.... the music is great.... sound quality is great... wish I could have been there...."
3,"Good travel system, but don't overload","I've had this travel system for 1.5 years now. The infant seat was great. The stroller is good with good storage underneath and easy to lay it back when the baby is asleep. Getting into the storage compartment when the baby is laid back is challenging, but this was a relatively infrequent problem for us.However, I must complain about the wheels. I like to stroll to the grocery store for a few items. Twice now, I've had to call for help when the stroller wheel broke off on me in the middle of our outing. Yes, I had exceeding the recommended weight for the system. But it is really easy to do with a 25lb toddler, a gallon of milk and a diaper bag."
1,Disgruntled,"This unit was hooked up as should be. It never worked. two e-mails, and two phone calls to the manufacturers ""tech support"" went unanswered. As per their written instructions, I complied with all, even accessing my ISP for their input, and Qwest to make sure I still had callwaiting. These units are showing up in bargain outlet stores, and a conversation with a manager of one, confirmed that they too were getting returns for non working units. This company needs to be more responsive to customers needs, or pull this ""junk"" off of the market."
4,Perfect,"This is Perfect for people who go online sometimes, not all the time or if you don't have alot of phone calls, just a few important call and if your a buissness-type person. I got this for Christmas and it is perfect. I don't get alot of phone calls while I'm online. Sure I get kicked off after 30 seconds while I'm talking on the phone, but hey, I didn't miss any important phone calls and it's almost like I have DSL, except for the speed and the connecting. The another good thing is it doesn't affect the speed."
1,"Worst CPU, they say 1.7Ghz but it calculate to 1.2GHz P4","This is the worst CPU, worst that AMD Duron.This CPU is not really running at 1.7Ghz, the cache on this CPU is only 128, comapring to P4 512.They say 1.7 but really runs at 1.2 GHZ or less comparing to P4 or Athlon XP."
2,TaiChi evaluation.,The service from Amazon was excellent.The book in itself was not of much value. It was difficult to follow the instructions and the exercise movements.Look for a better instruction book.
3,Portrayal of Roman Republic and its fall were excellent,"The book was a little difficult to read at times, probably due to its originally being written in German & then translated into English. The portrayal of Caesar was thorough and interesting, but at times I found it hard to relate to him personnally...probably because it's a 2 thousand year old story. The best part of the book was the portrayal of the Roman Republic and its fall. I found very interesting Meier's descriptions of the paradoxes existing in the republic."
4,"Fine work, but somewhat distracted","Fully in keeping with modern historical outlooks, Meier's Caesar is a man embedded in his times. As a result much of this otherwise excellent work is devoted to describing and analyzing those times. For readers familiar with the Republic, he has some interesting observations to make on the nature of the Republic and its ruling elite, but these digressions can become distracting and frustrating. Increasingly, I found myself wanting to know more about what Caesar was doing, not Cato or Cicero or Pompey. Also, I found his notion of the ""two realities"" (one for the Republic, one for Caesar) a bit trendy and unconvincing. Despite these criticisms, it is a good book and a very useful overview not just of Caesar but the entire Late Republic."
2,OK,"There are not a lot of good books out there for this kind of thing. In that respect, there is a lot to learn out of this book for a newbie. But I have to say I have found more than a few inaccuracies in this book. You would think for an exam guide, they would get a few professionals to proofread it first - before publication."
4,Not as good as thr old Mennen Pre Shave.,"Not as good as the old Mennen pre Shave. Does not smell as good, kind of sticky. When you have a winner, don't change the formula. It is OK , but not as good."
5,Better than good cables.,"First off these are the biggest cables I've ever bought,These cables are just as big as my Pete Cornish guitar cables times three...No problem with the color but the only problem with these cables are that they are kina'hard to plum thru your armoire and the plastic emblem that holds these cables together can get caught real easy in your entertainment center's back board...I can tell these cables are robust enough to last long periods of play from what source you use DVD/VCR/SAT.ect...My last opinon..It's not necessary to have all that fancy color coding and flair cause these cables are to be used behind the TV were noone will see them."
4,Kind of Blue,This is a very thorough description on the making of one of the best Jazz albums of all time. The author does repeat himself a lot of the time and the book could have been shorter without losing any of the detail. I am really new to jazz but this album was so special after playing it only 2 or 3 times that I wanted to know how it came about. I would have liked more information on the Lydian system and examples of where it was used on the recodings. There are some wonderful stories on each of the band members and the lead up to the album. Nisenson does a great job and leaves you wanting more info on the lives of the players.
1,an horrendous book with a misleading title.,"There are very few facts in this book. Most of the book is about the bio of the musicians and how miles discovered modal. Every chapter is filled with annoying opinions about this or that musician or this or that solo. We can listen for ourselves, don't tell me who's good and who's bad. I'll buy Downbeat for that. There is one small chapter about the actual session and it is very very very disappointing. My recommendation? do not buy this book, I could not finish it, I left in on the plane."
3,a decent overview of jazz and Kind of Blue,"Unlike other reviewers below, I haven't read the author's other books, so I have to judge this one on its own merit. As far as his knowledge, he provides an excellent overview of various jazz styles and competent quick bios of the major players. My problem is with the pastiche-like feel of the book. It feels like the author slapped together a whole bunch of short encyclopedia articles, added some musical commentary and bang, had a book. At times it feels less than professional -- he mentions the drug and dope band thing about 20 times, plus a bit of namedropping on all his personal meetings with Miles.Despite the fact it reads a bit like a late night college paper, I did learn a lot about jazz history, the lives of the players and the mood of the album. The author knows his stuff in this regard. If you're a big fan of the album, you'll cull some interesting information from this book. Don't let the small writing problems get in your way."
1,Fawning with a vengeance,"Okay, there is some interesting information here, but there's also quite a bit of fiction. Too often, the author infers the state of mind of his subjects. So he was a friend of Miles. Was he also psychic?I agree with another reviewer that the book is fawning. While the author of this book ascribes much of Miles' anti-social behavior to principle, still another reviewer correctly points out that it actually reveals him to be a jerk. The author's adoration of Miles taints his objectivity. The result is an unwitting and failed attempt at a snow job.Ashley Kahn's book on the making of Kind of Blue (which see) is not as adulatory, but in attempting to include musical information Kahn makes many errors, and glosses over the numerous mistakes Columbia Records made in recording and releasing the album.Browse through this book for the fun of it, if you're amused by fairy tales and delight in the hype of a press release."
3,Decent watch for the price,"For the price this watch clearly is a good buy. While the face doesn't really have the clean look of a high end watch, it has a lot of bells an whistles.The timer works well. The analog and digital readout all work well. It has a chime that goes off hourly that I finally turned off after fiddling with it for 30 minutes.The instructions could be more user friendly. They come on a small piece of paper less than the size of two business cards. The print is so small and in light color ink, they should have sent a magnifying glass with it.Nevertheless it did work. And for $20 I'm not complaining."
5,Amazing Crepes,"I purchased this book for my wife for Christmas and I have to say, it's her favorite cook book, along as the rest of us as we've been enjoying one spectacular meal of crepes after another. Anyone who loves Crepes will love this book. A must have for every enthusiast!"
2,watered down,"I first used the pumpkin rehydrating conditioner mask at a salon and I loved it. The smell is phenomenal and it works wonders on my course and kinky hair. I thought I would really like the shampoo also but I found it to be very watery and takes a few times to actually work up any lather in my hair, I really love the smell but the shampoo doesn't really work that well."
2,"Generally good book, but misses the mark on fairness.","I love to read about martyrs for Christ, but I became alarmed by the authors continued negative representation of those from Catholic and Orthodox faiths. Saints and sinners (and martyrs) can be found from any faith. It is hard to imagine how some of the obvious Catholic martyrs (Thomas More, John Foster, Fr. Miguel Pro, Edith Stein, Fr. Maximilian Kolbe and many, many more) were not included in a work of this sort."
2,Tried it once,"Since I don't have television, try to find entertainment online. I tried this show once but didn't like it. Matthew Perry is entertaining though and hopefully will find his venue."
2,it was ok,I thought that this show was ok. I didnt give it a five stars due to the fact that i really did not get into it. that is ok we all do not like the same things in life.
4,Good TV.,"Really enjoyed the pilot. waiting for more. I enjoy seeing Matthew Perry in a lighter, funny role again. I loved studio 60 series. it had plenty of Smart laughs, but it lacked the fun laughs. This show (GO On) has lots of fun laughs and enough smart laughs to keep me from feeling dumb. so far so good. keep the episodes coming!"
1,Hummers ignore it.,"Bought this product at Big Box store,easy to use no boiling,can mix small amounts which eliminates having to refrigerate.However, hummers completly ignore it .They all are still goimg to the one feeder I have with the simple syrup nectar that I made."
1,I'm looking for something cheaper,This turns out to be exactly the same price as the 1.5# boxes you can get at Wal-mart. I'm looking for something cheaper.
4,Kicks is cool,"Frankly with every book I read I take on the charecters a little and I grow from them, I have learned to love these charecters and their adventures, and I hope the same for you!"
4,The Masks of Flipside-review,"Mr. Cadet has written a wonderfully poetic book of short stories. At the end of each story the reader is salivating for more. His witty phrases make you laugh as well as go out and use them yourself in your every day conversations. In a world where to many authors echo the same sentiment, his views are refreshingly different. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a good story."
1,THE WORST,"This band, is by far the worst band i have ever seen live. I went to the dredg show( a mellow, excellent band)and i was expecting good bands to play seeing how good dredg is. boy was i wrong. HAC, has the dumbest lyrics ever!.... Im pretty tolerent of bad music, and am able to silence my opinion, but these guys [stink]....I think these guys belong on say the disney channel, playing back up for the new hillary duff album. Their music has no value to it, and it didnt even make me want to dance(like Mr. Bungle, or Mindless self Indulgence does). All in All HAC is probably the worst band i have ever herd period"
3,"Not a fan of rap rock, BUT....","I give it three stars. It's great. It's dirty, and I absolutely LOVE one song and that's Fever for the Flava.The video is great!This was another one of my random DIRTY music buys. I have to say, I'm glad I bought the CD simply for that song because it absolutely ROCKS.Other than that, the rock rap is there, and I'm not a big fan of it. But I have to say, that it's worth it, for that one song. It's AWESOME!*grins*"
3,OK,I liked about half of the songs and didn't care for the other half. So I'd say this CD is only ok
2,Weak,"This is better than the first Classics Live, but it's still weak. The band was still rusty coming into their reunion, and Steven's voice needed some work. That coupled with a very predictable song selection make this a poor live album."
3,Aerosmith - 'Classics Live! Volume 2' (Sony),"Heard that most if not all the eight(8) cuts on this CD was recorded live at a reunion gig that took place on New Year's Eve,1984. 'Classics Live! Vol.2' is decent,but certainly nothing to flip out over. The sound quality is,well good FOR a live recording as such. Tunes that lured me into keeping this disc handy for repeated spins were ""Back In The Saddle"", ""Walk This Way"", ""Draw The Line"" and ""Toys In The Attic"" (this song has always had special meaning to me). Worth checking out."
2,Not the original translation!,"Please be aware that this is not the original translation (or at least the 1975 one). I mistakenly bought this, even especially looking for the large format edition, and found that it was not the one I remembered from my childhood. The original translation in entitled Peter's Adventures in Blueberry Land and in translated by Sheila LaFarge. I found the original to be much more quaint and it correctly identifies the mother in red as Mrs. Lingonberry, not Mrs. Cranberry. Why would they translate it as cranberry, when Elsa Beskow goes to the trouble to try and illustrate her botanicals correctly? Anyway, I wanted others to avoid the same mistake and disappointment. I wish the publishers and booksellers had made the difference more clear.BTW, so far, findings of Sheila LaFarge translation are very expensive!"
4,Good Price for the 4 Books.,"I bought this pack of 4 books based on the reviews from this site. The books helped me pass all the 4 core exams on my first attempt in a one month period of serious study. However you will need read carefully, and additional reading material from Microsoft."
3,Unexpected errors...,"After reading a few chapters on the network essentials, I found some incorrect figures and typing error. I expect the newer edition suppose to be improved from the first edition, but in fact the newer edition had more mistakes than the first. (e.g. the newer edition provided a star topology figure as a physical mesh). hope I won't find any more mistake for the rest of reading."
2,You get what you pay for!,"These book only skim the surface of the details that you will see on the test. If all you want to do learn enough to JUST pass the exam, then these books are for you!On most of the tests, there are at least 3-5 questions covering material found no where in the book. Doesn't sound like much until you realize there are only 30 questions on the entire exam. I have passed all four exams at this point on the first try.To Summarize: Networking Essentials was a good book. Past that the rest of the books were crap. Most people I know use the Transender Practice Exams to supplement these poorly written books. It is amazing to see how much information these books do not cover.My advice would be to check out the books from Microsoft Press. Consider it an investment in your career. Also they cover the same material in three books."
4,It helped me get certified,"I used these to get certified and pass all my core requirements tests. They are usefull and you can have them for a great resource although they are a little basic, and they are only good for certification."
3,Not for college students,"I am in search of a laptop for college :) and I heard great reviews on Lenovo, so I purchased one. Turns out, its one of those old computers, that isn't for the modern student, no offence but its great for mom and dad :) but for a gamer/student, yeah not the best product ^^. The company, computerpawn, is fairly decent, although a little disappointed I had to pay for my own shipping, as I returned it."
4,Timeless,"The only reason I give this (the first & best Matt Bianco album to date) four instead of five stars is probably purely the record companys fault...Firstly, when I first heard the album back in the early eighties it was on a tape that included things that are not on the CD I just bought.1) Track 2,the version of 'More Than I Can Bear' is not the one with Basia's soothingly brilliant backing vocals on it (there is a version featuring Basia which is better)2) Track 4, 'Half A Minute' is not the 12"" version as I'm sure it was on the tape3) & of course as has been mentioned, no 'Big Rosie' which I think was track 10 on the tape before 'Matts Mood II'Mark Reilly, Basia, Danny White & not forgetting Ronnie Ross' sax playing and all the other musicians made an album that was way ahead of its time and still sounds fresh today."
4,Fantastic mecha hold this faithful film together.,"although not for everyone, mecha fans and otakon alike will be pleased with Tekkaman. the mech designs are fantasticly organic, similair to Evangelion. The dubbing is fine, as with most of Urban Vision's titles, and it captures alot of the feeling of the original Tekkaman series. this is great fun, but don't reccomend it to someone who hasn't seen anime before."
3,"Fairly decent, small flaws","The Squirt P4 has a decent tool selection and all the tools work very well. Its main shortcomings are in the ""fit and finish"" department. This thing abounds with edges that haven't been relieved. The heads on the stainless steel rivets that hold the Squirt together have very thin, sharp edges and sit slightly proud of the body--I feel them every time I use the tool.I've carried P4 on my keyring for about a year and a half (displacing the Victorinox I've carried on there for the last 20+ years)and the cheap metal on the sides of the tool is soft enough that the three keys on my keyring have scarred the edges--creating yet another unpleasant surface I feel every time I use the tool.So, functionally it is a great tool. On the other hand, its poor fit and finish, and poor choice of materials let it down."
1,Warning--does not have padded forearms!,Please be aware if you are purchasing this and require padding--this jersey does not have it. I have noticed other websites selling this same jersey and also using the same description. I ordered it and had to send it back--at my own cost plus an additional re-stocking fee.
5,Wow this stuff really works,I was skeptical since all other waxes have never really worked. I followed the directions exactly and used on my eyebrows and upper lip. It was soooo easy. You will a pretty gnarly red mark but i will go away in a few hours. Highly recommend!
4,"Great set, spoons are a problem",I like this set of canisters. They are pretty and work well on my counter top. I had to take the spoons off because they were problematic. But it was nice; I created my own labels for them (pretty ones) and put them on. Nice addition to my kitchen.
4,"Fine social-history, but somewhat haphazard in its structure","To be clear - I love this book. The daily minutiae of Japanese social history is fascinating and clearly well researched. It covers the history of food, clothing, furnishing, home architecture, sanitation and so on in fascinating detail.However there are two structural problems that get in the way of the more casual reader. Firstly, there is an assumed knowledge of the flow of Japanese history over the last few hundred years. It would be great if the author could at least include an overview chapter of significant periods and major social movements, or a timeline, for reference. Secondly, some material could be gathered together more consistently, for example information about clothing is scattered somewhat haphazardly throughout the book."
4,Good stuff.,This is my first read of Hamilton. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading more of him.
5,"His impact was tremendous, although buried by TR's reputation","The impact of McKinley's presidency is widespread but the last couple of pages of this book summarize the problem.. TR was just too widely known and basically blurred out McKinley's impact on today's memory. From Cuba to the Phillipines, from Hawaii to US society as a whole, this president had a wide net of influence across the globe. The writer did an great job of summarizing these obstacles and challenges. I have a goal to read a book about every president and this one was a great source for a president that is hard to find a lot of information about. Summary, please read it!!"
2,boys are worth it,"Boys are worth it. They do deserve just as much fuss and time as our girls. The interest has peaked on this topic and the author's aren't living up to their potential. Slow down authors. We will wait for sincere and more weighted guidelines for our sons. For parents who want to raise thinking, creative and caring children (especially boys) consider other worthy words from two other great books: ""Loneliness in Childhood and Adolescence,"" and ''MOMMY-CEO,'' (not at all what you're thinking but great in sharing the little but important stuff) and both are easy friendly reading."
4,Glad I took the time to read it,"I didn't intend to read this one because I knew from reading Killing Moon that it would concern just the detective, Jack Thorton, and not any of the werewolves. Then, later, I checked out Full Moon from the library not even realizing that it was actually a combination of both Killing Moon and Edge of the Moon. I'm glad I made that mistake. Edge... was actually quite a fast-paced, fun read. My sole complaint was the fact that this story sounds sooooo much like the Alex Cross series from James Patterson. Alex, too, has two kids (boy and girl), a decease wife, an elderly lady who watches his kids for him, and crazy serial killers after him. So, one star off for lack of orginality."
3,"Edge of the Moon (The Moon Series, Book 2) by Rebecca York","Rebecca York - Berkley Publishig Group - Edge of the MoonThis book was much better than the first in the series. We were given more details about the characters and had a fuller scope of their feelings in this book. The book centers around Kathryn Reynolds who tenent is missing. She calls in to report it and comes in contact for the first time with Jack Thornton a cop. They go on a wild journey through sharing dreams and defending themselves against a magician who is hell bent on owning a demon. He decides to use Jack and Kathryn in his plan to take ownership of the demon. By the way, he also happens to be a serial killer. It is an exciting ride through the sick mind of a killer and the paranormal world that the demon inhabits."
2,Weird,"I got into this book without knowing WHAT I was getting into. I don't pick up stories of this kind as a rule, but I was fooled by the plot of this story outlined on the cover. Now that I know this had pre-equal and a sequel, I won't have to read anymore, especially since it is revealed that Jack had a lover in the first book too. It was all too much to believe and I guess you can do anything if a magician and demon are involved."
5,Howling success,"With her follow-up to Killing Moon, Rebecca York continues her exploration of the world she has created and expands upon it. The main focus in this book is on police Detective Jack Thornton and a beautiful woman who reported her roommate missing - which roommate is later found dead, killed by a vicious serial murderer who is now focused on Jack's new-found love. I hate to say more so as to avoid ruining the suspense, so I'll leave it at that - just add my accolades. The pacing was terrific, the plot keep me turning pages and the characters were well-written and believable. I plan to keep going on this series as I can. It is terrific."
3,Makes me want to read more of her work.,"This was actually my first experience with Doris Lessing, tho I've heard of her for years. Her picture of the So. African experience was quite revealing but I got a little tired of the analysis of those who joined the communist movement. It seems that though she worked as an activist, she never really'bought' the doctrine, to her credit. But she seems to have a need to over analyse the motives. It seems to me that most of the people were just trying to improve the social ills of the time and were taken in by the communist rhetoric. The writing was good enough to keep me reading even though I wasn't too happy with the her bohemian attitude; abandoning her children, taking successive lovers.... I respect her intellect but not her morals.I am not inclined to look for the second installment."
5,"Sincere, frank, honest -- a wonderful autobiography","As befits this marvelous writer's lifetime work, the autobiography tells all -- love affairs, difficult relationship with parents and children, disillusion with communism, a clear denouncing of the stupid fad of ""politically correctness"". Best biography of the year."
1,IT's didnt come to my house i think postofficers are lost it!!,I gave that order about 1.5 weeks ago they said it will come on thursday (last week) i don't know why it isnt come yet i want my money back!
1,Garbage,"The company that sold this gave me a FAKE. Yes they gave me imitation cologne. And you are probably wondering how I know that it was fake, well it was because I have had this cologne for almost 3 years and when they sent me whatever was in their bottle it basically smelled like rubbing alcohol. The only positive is that when I called the company for a refund and explanation they said just send the bottle back and we will refund you completely even for shipping and handling. Overall I think I am going to stick to buying cologne from stores not online then I can smell it before I buy it."
1,Bad product & Service,"I order these DVD's and none of them played on the DVD players in my home (3) in total. Even took them to another house to attempt to watch them and had the same results (2 DVD players).I then returned the DVD's to this dealer. Not only have I not received a response after (3) attempts, I have not received a credit for my return or offering any resolution. It has been over 2 months and still nothing.I would advise anyone NOT TO PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALER. Horrible customer service and products do NOT work. I must now attempt to get the funds back from my bank since NO ONE at this dealer will contact me or provide me with a contact number.Basically I got screwed!!!! Avoid them at all cost."
4,I also wondered about the credits,"I watched this on TV all those years ago and remember being very impressed with the acting of Henry Cele (who at the time was better known for his soccer skills). I didn't even remember Edward Fox being in it! So I was also surprised to see his name didn't appear in the credits.A bit of Googling showed that he unfortunately died in 2007, which may be the reason.I haven't ordered a copy of this yet but I definitely think I will."
4,Very comprehensive manual,I found this to provide a wealth of information on the digital photo revolution as well as providing an exhaustive treatment of processing after the photograph.I learned a lot and am still learning a lot. I downgraded the manual 1 star because of the reliance on the use of Photoshop which I don't have even though sample software is included with the book.
3,"The ""In""Complete Digital Photography","This book is LACKING much needed information. I am a serious amatuer digital photographer. I was hoping for a book with good examples and several colored photographs. This is one fat book and it only contains EIGHT COLOR PAGES with POOR EXAMPLES.Ben Long (the author) just ""touches"" the subjects and never bothers to go into much detail. He also does not offer many suggestions or situations when manual functions would be helpful. Charts with examples might help (but they do not exist within this text).I also agree with the other[Amazon.com]reviewer that stated that this book needed an editor or proofreader. While reading this book I came across SEVERAL ERRORS (one error in a book is too many and this book contained many).This book did not offer me any assistance in mastering the art of digital photography. I wish I had spent my hard-earned dollars on a different book :o("
3,good but a bit misleading,"I had read reviews that this was a more ""rock"" blues cd, but for the most part it is somewhat plodding. The guy clearly has skills, and it's worth the price of the cd just to hear his cover of Zeppelin's Tea For One...just awesome. I also liked Bridge to Better Days, which I would have sworn was a cover of someone else's song but was actually written by Bonamassa...I've heard it somewhere before this cd, maybe a movie soundtrack or something. Hopefully someone can convince him to let it rip on subsequent releases, because the guy can play."
5,Blues Rock of the Classic English Style,"You can hear Joe's influences in this album more than in his previous work; classic English blues rockers like Beck and Page. His cover of Zepplin's Tea for One is the BEST attempt to replicate a seldom played masterpiece. I think it's better than the original. The rythm section is anchored by none other than Jason Bohnam, and that apple didn't fall far from the tree either."
2,Not his best work.,"I had purchased Joe's albumSloe Gina few months prior to this one, and I was blown away. It showed his real talent and his ability to play heavy blues guitar with a new sound in each song.His guitar playing in this album his guitar playing is still good, but the music is very boring. Someone with Joe's talent should be playing better songs with a much better band."
2,Not what I expexted?,"With a big name producer, Jason Bonham on drums and Carmine Rojas on bass. I expected a guitar ""Rippin'"", ""Rocked Out"" ride from Joe. It's a diverse effort I'll give it that, but not a lot of excitement on this one. I hate to say that because I'm a huge fan of Joe's work. For me it just didn't have the same fire and passion as previous releases. If you liked ""Blues Deluxe"" this is for you. It's more diverse than that, but definately on the mellower side than previous work from Joe. ""Joe come back to us"". Give us more ""Pain and Sorrow""!! If your not familiar, that's Joe's equivalent of ""Free Bird"" from ""So It's Like That"". That and ""A New Day Yesterday"" were much better releases than this one. So if you like your ""Joe"" on the bluesy side this is for you. I like my Joe ROCKIN!"
2,"Looks good, but ...","Looks good, but ... Where it says ""elegant fruitwood finish"" you might think, as I did, that that means a real wood veneer, and just like me you would be wrong. The finish is some kind of contact paper or painted on stuff that can be damaged with very little effort. This on top of some pressed together saw dust. If you never intend on moving it it should hold up OK if your gentle. Putting it together is pretty straight forward, but very time consuming. I bought the whole set and every piece had damage, most of it out of sight, but still. Bottomline, unless you live in the middle of no where, check around and look for sales and you'll be able to get ""solid"" real wood furniture that you'll be much happier with for the same price or a little more."
3,"Not perfect, but....","This was fun read, a little too cluttered in places, but the character of Elizabeth Elliot is utterly charming and fascinating, which made the book worth reading. I'll be seeking out more of this series, just for the fun of reading about Elliot."
2,cheap,My little guy doesn't like this at all. I was hoping it would entertain him but it doesn't.It may be good for some kids but not my son.Very flimsyI'll try it again when he is a little older.
2,ok- but not favorite of amazon purchases,It's not as interactive for the child as it looked in the picture. Child will need direction until they can figure out what they are doing.
2,Fit for a 60-year-old bride.,"This book was quite dissapointing. It was extremely old fashioned. Most of the bouquet techniques used in this book were discontinued by professional florists. And out of the 125 pages only 4 are dedicated to hand-tied bouquets. Everything else is basically foam bouquet holders.Also, the flowers used are what was considered hip in the 70's. Lots of roses and carnations, lots and LOTS of baby's breath and fillers. The flower glossary of ""popular wedding flowers"" doesn't even include calla lilies or hydrangeas.On the upside, it does contain detailed instructions."
2,Cheesy and Tacky,"Most of the designs depicted in this book are truly passé and tacky. There are multiple points wherein the author suggests using silk flowers. Do they even make those anymore?!?! The headpiece she shows looks like something that came out of the children's costume drawer. There is literally a square of craft tulle attached to the back! I could make something more elegant and believable without directions.The author relies heavily on plastic and foam implements to construct her bouquets, and her shapes and flower choices are positively outdated. If you want your wedding to look like a low-budget 1960s throwback, go ahead and use this book.On a positive note, there are good instructions for making boutonnieres, although I'd advise leaving out the old-fashioned baby's breath sprigs.Another plus - you will have a good laugh at the bridal gowns the models are wearing. Wedding day at the FLDS compound!"
4,good rock funking stanky grooves,"if you are a serious funk fan check this out the bar kays was one of the best funkiest bands that lived their whole discography is worth checking into this 2 cd disc set is worth the money the funk lives here influenced heavily by motown, james brown, and funkadelic although funkadelic was more out there than the barkays still you want real funk this isn't bad."
4,Nice addition to the lean book world,"This is a book that's needed publishing for quite some time. Most lean books focus on what you *should* do, assuming that your lean effort can absolutely be a success. This book recognizes that lean transformation is very difficult and can get derailed easily. Of the ten reasons that lean failures occur, he specifies two of them as absolute show stoppers and the other eight are things that can slow down your lean effort. The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is its relatively short length (which can be a plus, however, if you're giving this to a busy executive). There were a few very good ""War Story"" examples in the book, which is what I really expected to read. The book could have been fleshed out with more war stories and case studies, that would have made it 5 stars."
2,"Probably effective, but Vanilla tastes HORRIFIC.","Accidentally ordered a 5.75-pound tub of this instead of Syntha-6 because they looked alike and I didn't bother reading the title.DECEPTIVE SERVING SIZE:The jar is almost 6 pounds, but each serving is 145g, so math -> 18 servings out of the entire huge jar. At 3 drinks a day, that's ONLY SIX DAYS.FOUL TASTE:I've had Chocolate Syntha-6, which was great. This ""Vanilla Ice Cream"" Truemass however, tastes like SOUR ROTTEN MILK. Absolutely vile, made me want to puke. My time in special forces taught me to eat anything regardless of taste, so I drank this down, but be warned. DO NOT GET IT!"
2,I loss weight on this gainer ???,"maybe some one can help me out but ive been on this for 2 weeks now and i have actually not gained at all?im even down a few poundls than normal. can some one help?? I eat somewhat healthy cuz im fairly picky, but i eat alot all day. i work out on a constant basis 5-6 times a week. 2 stars cuz the taste is not that bad but ive seen no effects"
4,good stuff,it works very good besides that makes my stomach a little gassy.i will have to mix with watr instead of milk.
3,tastes bad...,"I originally had vanilla ice cream flavor, which tasted really good. I figured I'd get the chocolate flavor since I like chocolate... Big mistake..."
4,Great product over all,This is a great product. I wanted to try a new flavor other than chocolate so I tried cookies and cream. It has a good flavor but I still like chocolate better.
3,Meh,"It's 3 scoops to get 47g of protein and 600 calories. That's not really a lean mass gainer, but it is a mass gainer. I've seen good steady gains in the last few months with it, and the test is good. One shake a day, and you'll get through the whole thing in less then 2 months."
2,Why I like my old one better,"Good qualitly, but...My older one had bamboo handles that hung at the top of my pot. My older one was SLIGHTLY bigger, allowing me to easily steam corn that was broken in 2. It looks like I am back to World Market again to replace my 10-year-old broken bamboo steamer. (This one will never get the chance to get broken by me for as little as I use it.)"
4,Eccentric!,I was engrossed in Temples from beginning to end. It had a different appeal to it. It made me want more!
5,Awesome game,"This game is probably one of the greatest RPG's I have ever played. Not because of the story but the wide variety of weapons to use, the great graphics, and so many special weapons and items you will be hooked for a couple of months. The story is ok but I wouldn't by this game for that. I like the battle system. It's not like the old RPG battle system where you select Attack, Magic, Item, or somthing like that. You run up to an enemy and just start swinging, or if you have a gun you stand back and start shooting. I also like the fact that you can make your own character. There are character to choose from but that desides your strength, how much magic you have, and stuff like that. The fun part is choosing their hieght, hair style, clothing color, facial features, and a name of course. If you have a dreamcast you have to have this game."
2,No online play...no fun at all,I bought Phantasy Star Online after Sega shut their servers down and never experienced the online play but from what I read it was the only way to play this game.The graphics are good and the story could pass but the gameplay sucks if you have to play alone. I don't know why Sega put 4 controller ports on the Dreamcast if I gotta be online to experience the multiplayer aspect.A HUGE disappoitment avoid like stale toast with rotten eggs!!
1,Does not work!,I do not have severe dark circles around my eyes but this product does not help me at all. Do not waste your money!
4,It is as described,"I was looking at two pedalboards and chose this one for it's features (power outlet) and pricing.The components are literally crammed together in there, so before ordering, make sure you measure the components you want to fit inside and leave some space for the connecting cables. You may need to purchase custom length cables or make your own. I found you will need lengths between 6"" to 18"""
1,not a trustworthy company,Thought I was getting a good deal. The laptop will not come on. Contacted the seller and was told tough luck. If I had known at the time I would have purchased this from somewhere else I will never order from this seller again. Buyer Beware the price is not worth the product.
2,Rated at 4 1/2:UPDATE: Rated at two. Read below.,"Well, this computer overheated once, I recieved it today. It is a OK computer, Overheated once Bluescreened 0 times. I just waned a travel notebook not worth $1000 like the MacBook air, so Dell came through again. Peace!UPDATE 9/3/2012Display died. I just bought a Mac. Just got this a couple months ago. Such a disapointment."
3,Not really complete...,"Although it says it's a Complete Guide, I didn't find it so. There is a level of assumed knowledge. So if you're a beginner, like me, skip this book and find something more basic.Specifically, it doesn't show how to thread a rod/reel; it doesn't show how to connect up sinkers, spinners, hooks, etc in the combinations you need for each type of fishing; and it doesn't describe how to do certain types of fishing -- it just names them and moves on.It's also not specific enough for the region you live in. It's a wide overview of the types of Freshwater fish found in the US, but it doesn't break it down by region. Try to find a local guidebook for the types of fish in your specific area instead."
2,Not what I have expected,"This wok works ok but turns out to be very difficult to maintain. Easily rusted. Everytime I wash it, I put it on the medium heat to dry it completely. But still it get rusted easily. This is not the wok for my style."
3,Nothing special,This wok is nothing special. If you go to an Asian food store or a store such as World Market you can get one on sale less expensive and just as good or better.
5,Works great!,"I bought this pack for my daughter a year ago when she was 9 years old. We do a lot of hiking and mountain bike riding. Her original pack, which was marketed for kids, did not have enough water or storage area. She loves this pack! One of the adult women in her biking club has the same pack and also enjoys it very much. The pack also has a nice look for women. My wife, on the other hand, who likes to drink a lot of water on the trail, would find this pack lacking. She uses the Camelbak Mule because the water reservoir is larger. The packs also provide spine protection if you crash. All the Camelbacs we own are rugged and comfortable. You may want to do some research on how to keep the water bag from ""flavoring"" the water. I often abandon by pack for a water bottle for sake of the flavor quality (which is a problem for all packs)."
1,Finicky,"My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas because my new camera required an awkward USB cable and I hated carrying it to and from school or waiting to upload my pictures. It worked fine the first time I used it then after that my computer only recognized it about 1/14 times I tried to plug it in. I have a standard SDHC card, so there is no reason it shouldn't work and it lights up when it is plugged in, but there must not be a good connection somewhere because my computer won't pick up that it is plugged in (and yes I've tried other computers).I can't say I'm all that upset, it is insanely cheap and it was a gift, but kind of a disappointment."
1,NOT PLUG AND PLAY,"It's insteresting when you buy a product and says it's plug and play and yet when you plug it in it doesn't play. Also said it came with an instruction manual hopefully a driver since it isn't plug and play like it is so indicated on the pakage, and yet it came with neither. I can't complain too much when you pay a dollar for something you get a dollars worth of work out of it. Thanks for the product though guys I now have a blue plastic paper weight or maybe a christmas tree ornament."
3,"Seems ok, so far.","Product received promptly as described. I got what I expected: a very cheaply made, poorly designed plastic card reader.The end caps simply slide on and don't ""snap"" into place, so they'll get lost soon.The device itself is relatively very wide (and tall) for a USB device, so can't be inserted alongside any other USB devices.But for $0.96, I'm happy with it. For 2 days now it has worked on 2 PC's with no problems at all. Hopefully, it'll hold up for at least a few months."
5,Great Item For a Great Price!,"This product does what it is suppose to, I simply stick in the sd memory card and instantly pops up the window on my computer. It also helps save my camera life battery so with this, I no longer have to have the camera turned on and connected to the computer. Great Item, I recommend it!"
3,The first one didn't work :(,The first one wouldn't recognize that there was a card in it. The seller however was very prompt in replacing it and the second one which was a different color and brand works great.
1,Junk,I had my doubts when purchasing this card reader but bought it anyway. Have tried to use it on multiple occasions but had no luck.
3,Good,I like this item but the case covering for the end where you insert the memory card easily comes off and it's easy to lose. Overall it's good though.
4,Why is this called a 10-in-one?,"Price was real good, Received it quickly. Sounds from the description that it should be called a 5-in-one, not a 10-in-one. I had a spare 1GB SD card laying around to test it, no problems. Left the SD card in and now I have a spare 1GB ""flash drive"". This is good because my new laptop pc has no card reader. I will carry this one with it and maybe I can call mine a 6-in-one now."
2,Does not last,"It worked well for a couple of months, then started to come apart. Super glue and duct tape held it together for a few more weeks, but eventually it would no longer read at all and ended up in the trash."
1,you get what you pay for,"I bought 4 of these figuring why not for the price. They work fine for my computer at home, but cause a hardware fault when plugged into computers at work (the computer just reboots after you plug it in and won't post). So they aren't very useful to me. And the cases they are in break very easy. I got a usb to sdhc from transcend that came with an shdc that i have had for over 1 year and works wonderfully. I would not recommend these."
1,"Died, dodgy","My first one died after about 9 months of use. One day, it simply stopped working. I ordered another, and it arrived useless upon arrival (will randomly eject itself from the computer when being read or written to). Return is pointless, seeing as I'm not paying to ship it back. Order with caution."
5,Easy card reader,"Fast shipping, easy to use reader/writer. So easy that my 81 year old mother-in-law thinks its easy!"
1,does not fit!,"It did not fit my sony pro duo adapter, even though it claimed to. It was too cheap to bother returning it, but just beware"
5,Exactly what I ordered!,"The memory card reader works flawlessly. It does exactly what I bought it to do, which is to transfer pictures from my digital camera to my computer. I'm very impressed with this product!"
4,The might of skinless,This is just insanity. Pure rage and they deserve alot more credit for their music.
1,Rambling and boring,"I do not recommend this book at all. In fairness, I couldn't get further than the first three chapters, so maybe it gets better later on in the book. He spends these chapters mostly rambling without a point. He has the very annoying habit of opening every paragraph with four questions and doesn't even begin to answer any of them. Even with a background understanding of the politics of the late Republic, Meier's questions hardly entice the reader to continue. Like many other reviewers, for a great historical biography, go with Peter Green's Alexander of Macedon and for a good introduction into the late Republic, go with Holland's Rubicon. Both are much more enjoyable than this book."
3,Slightly Scholarly Caesar,"Christian Meier's biography presents the facts of Caesars life and does quite a bit of analyzation as he asks why Caesar did some of the things he did. For instance, Meier answers the age old question of why Caesar crossed the Rubicon, by suggesting Caesar was orced by the Senatus Consultum Ultimum making him an enemy of the republic, but he does note it still took some vanity to ignite a civil war on his own behalf. Meier provides good insight into the life of Caesar, but the book overall is a bit of a dry, scholarly read. If you want to get into Caesar's head and dont mind the dry prose this book is for you."
2,Not many tips. Too much filling text.,"I heard about the book in a recent usability conference and bought it immediately. Conversion rates are probably the most important issues for anyone involved in managing a website and I expected to find lots of best-case examples and useful tips. Unfortunately the book does not have them. With more than 300 pages only 30 of them have examples of screenshots, not only that, half of them are of just one site: Cafepress. Too much text to state the obvious and few real life examples.Oh, and the cover picture is just horrendous."
3,BUY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RECORD MOVIES,"it would be a definitly 5 stars IF it could record movies. DON'T GET ANGRY AS I DID. Know that this camera DON'T RECORD MOVIES AT ALL! That's the American Version (with the ""U"" at the end) and I don't know why they make it that way. Did not find any advantage compared with the same camera, without the ""U"" at the end (international version).Buy the international version instead.I feel embrassed I got into this bad deal. Great camera (REEEEEALY great) if I did not have this expectation. IT'S A TRAP, not clearly advised at all. Only reading BOTH manuals would give a sure about what I realized and I'm telling to you."
2,"Buyer Beware! - Decent camera, bad service & false warranty","The LCD screen began manfunctioning within the fourth month of light use. CASIO support now states that ""lens and screens"" are not covered by their warranty despite what is stated in their products and their website."
5,camera simplicity,I am proud to own this tiny camera with the ease of use. I keep it in my hanbag.My daughter has one and after seeing it I went out to buy one. I am looking for an extra battery and have been unable to find one-elilim np 20. Can someone help me with this. thank you.Bev Byrne bevbyrne@adelphia.net
4,Keeps with Emeril's usual great format.,"After watching several of Emeril's shows, I decided to purchase the book. I am really glad that I did. Yes, you could probably print many of the recipes from the internet, but I have found it really interesting, as well as many more recipes, that I haven't seen on his shows. There are probably a few more than necessary nonscence photo's, and it should have more photo's of the different recipes that are in the book, but I love it just the same...The recipes are basically easy to follow."
1,Still a mystery to me ...,"Emeril has to be one of the worst chefs on television. He is clumsy, sloppy and wasteful. Almost all of his dishes from his live shows are already made by someone else. He has the basic cooking skills of a 13-year old. And not to mention all those tasteless jokes. Yet, he is popular as ever, every time I turn the channel to food network, and there he is, bamming away for another hour. His popularity is a mystery to me; perhaps he makes average homemakers feel comforting because if he can become so famous with such poor culinary skills, so can anyone. Give me chefs like Jacques Pepin, and Jacques Torres, watching their shows, you will know why they are the ""professional"" chefs. And you will definitely learn something. If you want to know the basic hows and whys of cooking and have fun with it, pick up a copy of Alton Brown's ""I'm Just Here for the Food"". As far as Emeril's book goes, it is more about how much he loves himself than how much he wants to teach you."
1,"Too bad I couldn't select ""ZERO STARS""","I have a feeling the 5 star reviewer here either A) did not read this book and is reviewing something else, or B) is a shill. There's nothing here that you can't get free a million places online, and without Lant's blatant self-promotion."
2,Defective picture tube,"Shortly after hooking it up to the cable box, I noticed a translucent blue green bloch about 3 inches in diameter in the upper left corner of the screen. I tried different sources (dvd) and various settings, but it didn't change anything.Aside from that, I simply could not adjust the picture such that the colors looked as good as my old sony analog tv which I had running beside it for comparison. The difference in resolution was very noticable, however the color on the zenith was inferior (in my opinion) to the sony (especially on skin tones)."
1,The most overrated blackjack book - Nothing original,"This is without a doubt the most ovverrated blackjack book. Scoblete is a professional writer, not a professional blackjack player. To the general public, this book is considered way up there, an incredible book. To those who are students of the game or professionals, realize scoblete is just a mickey mouse. There is nothing new in this book. Read the works of Wong, Snyder, Schlesinger, Anderson and Zender for serious texts."
5,Excellent book for strategies and insight,Frank Scoblete is an enjoyable writer who really understands what it takes to beat blackjack. The book is truly loaded with useful information and tips to make you winner. I can recommend it for beginners and advanced players as there is plenty for everyone. I especially enjoyed Scoblete's writing style. he has great wit and tells a wonderful story. This is one blackjack book that is not dry.
1,Poorly Laid,A quikie indeed.I got it and it was over.A poorly laidout book. The material may be too exciting to stay with it longer than a minute.
2,"Okay, but not nearly so good as the original author","Because I loved the original Lensman series so much, I was somewhat disappointed in this book. The plot itself seemed weak, and the story was told very slowly. I completed the book, but, for me, it was a very difficult read.Do not buy this book with the expectation that you will get the same feeling that you did from the original series, becasue you will not."
5,A Wild Adventure!!,"I am a fan of this time period and so these books were great! I was completely wrapped up in the books, held from beginning to end. Francis' adventures and trials were bunches of fun to experience and I will no doubt pick it up soon and reread it again!The writing is simple enough for a twelve year old to understand, yet I found it enjoyable. This author is great! I highly recommend these books!!"
5,Great Book,"I think that Tucket's Travels is a good book because there are so many adventures and I really like finishing one book after another. There are a lot of details and I think that only 8 years old or up should read the book. My favorite part of the book is when Mr Tucket gets away from the Pawnee tribe of Indians. The characters are Mr Grimes, Francis Tucket-Mr Tucket, Lottie-Charlotte, and Billy. My favorite character is,other than Mr Tucket, Lottie. I think Tucket's Travels is the best book I have ever read."
1,no good juicer,"Returning Juicer after just one try. the blade is not sufficiently sharp and wont shred vegetables. Studying the blade you can see that the small spikes are completely flat. Very little or no juice came out of the machine. Vegetables that arent shredded builds up as a lump inside the machine and causes the juicer to spin uncontrollably. The machine is also VERY loud and making juice is like being outside at an airport. Switched juicer to have one that was not made of plastic. However, im willing to take the risk of using plastic Omega Vert Juicer compared to not getting any juice at all, and having to worry about my own safety."
3,fast delivery :) Just super noisy.. don't know why:(,"Fast delivery :) Just super noisy.. don't know why:( My Godmother has an older version of this machine and its not so noisy!! Other than that, it juices great!! Roughage is super dry after!! :)"
5,Acme set the standard for juicers,"Acme was the standard for juicers when we purchased ours 15 years ago. It still does everything -- soft, hard, and green leafy vegetables, fruits, and root vegetables. The pulp from carrot and celery make the base for a great ""un-chicken"" salad.The citrus attachment is a worthwhile accesssory for orange and grapefruit juices. It is rock-solid and has never needed any part repaired or replaced.On the down side, it is heavy, bulky, a bit noisy. The newer juicers appear more ergonomic and boast more features, but I'm not sure if they can lay claim to the durablility of the Acme."
1,Terrible product & horrid customer service; STAY AWAY!,"This was bought as a gift in January but just started using it last week & motor stalls; metal shavings are in drink; and it rattles terribly. I do NOT want another one from the manufacturer and at no time at the point of sale was I advised that I had only 30 days to return it.Years ago, I owned 2 of these juicers that were made well but now, the product is inferior and cheaply made.Vendor refuses to take it back; they are nasty and rude. BEWARE! I am having amazon do an A-Z claim in order to get my money back for this piece of junk. What a dreadful experience this has been!"
5,Punch yourself in the throat if you don't own this one!,"I was introduced to HSB summer 2002. I had no idea what I was missing. If you are a fan or metal, metal core, death metal and hardcore, you must purchase this album immediately. These five guys have taken the best aspects of every genre and melded them into a consise representation. It doesn't sound like seperate parts. It's almost as if it's a completely new sound. I've heard Whatever It May Take a million times, and there are still times that it sends chills down my arms. They're earlier stuff is definitely worth looking into as well. Visit the Lifeforce records website for MP3s and a live video and don't forget their self titled web site. I look forward to seeing them if they ever make it to the US."
4,fantastic deathcore from eurpoe,"Heaven Shall Burn falls alongside bands such as Arkangel, Caliban (who've they done a split with), The Red Chord and others. This is primarily metal but there is a strong hardcore streak running through this giving it a highly aggressive edge coupled alongside thundering double bass and fast metal riffing. Fans of metal and hardcore will enjoy this making it an excellent crossover album. Check out the aforementioned bands as well for more fantastic music of this style"
1,bananas and coffee just don't go together,"I purchase coffee from this company all the time but this flavor was the worst! I thought it sounded yummy but it tasted gross. The banana flavor tasted sour or as though a banana went ""bad"". I would recommend this company but not the flavor."
4,"Coming of age in a real family, complete with real problems","The kind of book I'd like my 6th and 7th graders to read and discuss in class, both for its history tie-ins and portrayal of almost-teenage Micah's life. Putnam follows Micah's journey from child to young teen by demonstrating his growing awareness -- and -- harder still -- acceptance of the complexities and imperfections of his friends and family."
5,Definitely Buy This Book...................,"This is a definite buy for any NIN fan. After reading this book, you will definitely have a new outlook on Trent and NIN. Although I try not to believe everything I read or hear unless it comes from Trent's mouth. Everything in this book sounds true to the best of my knowledge, and believe me I've done my homework. Trent is a very non-public person, you will appreciate learning more information about him, his background, the way he thinks, his music and the coming together of Nine Inch Nails. You will be impressed by this book.........go buy it! Trent...your in *A Warm Place* in my heart!"
4,nin review,"I think this book is good, but it could have been a little more detailed- i.e.- most of this book is merely excerpts and quotes from trent himself or from interviews that huxley could get a hold of. I did enjoy it; it has wonderfully deep insights into trents' feelings about everything from rumours about courtney love to his long, painful battle with tvt records, to even how he felt while recording ""hurt"" for the first time. Good book, but if you arent a MAJOR nin fan like me, its not worth buying."
4,nice book,"well,I'm a NIN fan for years and I think that this book explains perfectly the musical vision of Trent Reznor, his efforts in making pretty hate machine, the incredible self destrcut tour, the story that lead to downward spiral.I learn a lot of things trought the quotation of Trent Reznor.It was really so enjoyable."
4,"Great, but could have been written better","Like what's been said, this is mainly a collection of interviews, but on the other hand it has different parts. The first part is sort of his life in Cleveland, and when he was in Option 30 and Exotic Birds. I didn't hear about the others as much. Then it gets into the part whenever he tours with Skinny Puppy, and spends time in UK. Then later, his not-so-good relationship with TVT, and Steve Gottlieb is one thing to mention on this. It also spoke about the PHM-era, and it talked mainly about the touring. It also had stuff on the Broken-era and then shortly after, TDS-era. In this one it has a lot. It even has reviews for it, about when he lived in ""le pig"", NOthing bands, etc. A must for a NINnie."
4,"The book is excellent just about the best,but......","There was to many article cut outs.It reminded me of when I was in school doing ""current events"".The auther should have use his own words and not someone else's.But besides that the book was great,he writes up a good story about him which is good."
1,"Looks nice outside, but inside it's JUNK!","First the plastic see-through dome cracked off the lid. Then, as other reviewers also mentioned, the heating element malfunctioned and would not brew the coffee. It would send a couple of perks of water through the grinds and then turn off.At the time, it costs me around $80 and I had this product for only 9 months. Delonghi requires faxing them the receipt, then sending them the electric cord and $7.50 to get a replacement.I will never again purchase a Delonghi product."
2,Not Worth It,"This season is deff weak, not worth it at all. i seen season 7 and at least thats a lil bit better. But im not gonna front the last two season have really gone down since Tony Childs left!"
5,Girlfriends: The Final Season,It was great to finally get it! I'd looked for the final seasons in many stores! Thanks so much and I'll shop with you more often!
1,Poor Service,"I never received this item because it was unavailable. I counted on getting this item for a gift and when Christmas came and went I still never had it. I did not find out til after Christmas, it was unavailable. I was very angry and dissatisfied with Amazon!"
5,Worth Training balls,My daughter is a catcher. We use the training balls to strengthen her arm (heavy ball) as well as increase her arm speed(light ball). So far so good. Quality product.
4,Review of the Handy Home Medical Adviser,The book arrived in a timely manner and was just as described. I would use these people again should I need another book that it hard to find.
5,as advertised,"the blender my wife loves broke a blade and the top was showing its age and had small leaks in use. the replacement fit perfectly and works well. it has saved us from purchasing a new complete Waring unit, which is very expensive, and will allow us to use out blender for years to come"
4,Waring Pro Blender,This blender makes the best smoothies I have ever made. It grinds the ice better than any blender I have ever used. I would not be without it.
1,Blade Assembly Shaft Failed; Warning Quality Control is Poor!,"I, too, experienced the failure of the blade assembly shaft with my replacement jar (not bought at Amazon, but it's the same model). The original jar and blade assembly lasted around 12 years; I probably made thousands of smoothies with it. The replacement jar lasted six. SMOOTHIES, not years!I love this blender, and the motor will probably last forever, but Waring's quality control appears to be poor now regarding their blender jars. I'm very disappointed with them. Waring, if you are reading these reviews, you need to address this issue immediately. I paid $60 for a replacement blender jar that failed after SIX USES. You're going to lose me as a customer if I don't see positive steps taken to address this issue."
1,"Leaky, never used!",I received a Waring 60th Anniversary Blender as a gift 2 years ago. I thought Waring was a good brand and had quality products. I did not use the blender until a week ago. I was surprised to find out that the jar was leaky from the bottom. Waring refused to replace or repair the jar since it had passed the limited warranty. I am very disappointed with the quality of the blender. Please don't be too sure about their products.
3,Goldtouch keyboard not quite golden.,"Love the tented tilt of the keyboard, but the buttons take much too much force to actuate. The microsoft keyboard is much better. The only reason I keep the thing is that there is less lateral movements of the buttons when pressed and I don't use this keyboard all day."
3,Uses besides for Pet Food,"What was I thinking in getting this? Read the dimensions carefully. This is a big container, and I only have one food fixated 17 pound cat who can't possibly need that much food on hand all the time. That said, if you have a very big dog or multiple pets, this item will work well for you. Note that the plastic isn't as sturdy as it could be. Mine came damaged, and I had the opportunity to test Amazon's slick return policy, which is virtually painless. When I receive my replacement, I intend to use it to store wrapping paper and package bows. It could also be used for storing Christmas ornaments."
2,Nice except for broken lid,The lid wouldn't stay on the container. Add to use masking tape to keep it closed. Otherwise nice container
4,Prototyp by Hurdy-Gurdy,"This group is... different, to say the least. They use sound bytes from the medieval instrument, The Hurdy-Gurdy, aka Crank Fiddle, aka I-could-never-play-one. This album is all instrumental, and has the ability to put you in a trance like state. This is not an in-the-car album. Before purchasing, look at their last-fm, or check the song ""Delirium"" out on playlist.com. I love this album, but I seriously doubt they'll make another. Their Myspace page hasn't been logged on to since 2007, and the music they have is a niche-ish style. You can't do much for a follow-up, unless the throw in a vocalist or percussion. Hell, give is an Apocalyptica setup, and then maybe you can have a follow up. But over all, this album is unique and deserves attention from those who enjoy trance music and light techno."
3,Not up to par,"Unfortunately author Hart isn't up to par in her latest Lawlessadventure, ""Merchant of Venus"". While the basic plot is promising, the book shows has excessive padding, and lacks the focus of previous efforts. Jane Lawless comes across vapid at times and her friend Cordelia is so busy feuding with her sisterthat her character lacks it's usual bigger that life comedy-drama. In the middle of her detecting, Jane mulls over the loss of her ex, Julia (a mistaken loss, in my opinion) whom Hart had her get rid of in the previous Lawless book, then gets back to following some rather unrealistic clues. Hart is usually a great writer, but ran out of ink on this one."
4,Crunch Pocket Multi-Tool,"I have been a user of the original Leatherman multi-tool when it first came out. After more than 20 years, I decided to get the crunch primarily because all the tools are locking and my original is not. It is the lightest in the heavy duty range and very well built. My only gripe is that every time I need to use the pliers, I have to assemble it. That's about it. Still getting use to the tool."
3,Adequate but that's all,If you don't have anything else this tool will do but that doesn't earn it 5 stars.All of the five star reviews for this product are written by Leatherman groupies. If this is the only tool you have it may do the job but if you have access to other tools you are not going to reach for it. If you are a serious cyclist your tool pouch has the tools it needs without this. If it doesn't add a miniature needle nose crunch - a real one and you are good to go.I have an original Leatherman and it is the greatest thing since sliced bread but that doesn't mean every subsequent product is a must have and this isn't. If you already have a leatherman tool you don't need this.I gave this three stars - it's adequate.
2,CLUNKY TOOL,"Difficult to keep pliers in proper configuration for use. Production quality is excellent, but new design needed for the plier. I am a true fan of Leatherman products but this tool was a waste of money."
5,Great tool,I love this tool. I love the finish and the tools it has on it. Very durable. The knife is sharp and has been shaarp for quite a while now
5,A Favorite of the little ones!,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Many nights I have heard her winding it up herself!
2,not worth the price,"For what I paid for this I ended up finding the cups, mat, timer, dvd instruciton video for the same price at a local department store."
3,review of stacking cups and service,All was as described and arrived in a timely manner. Good service
5,Sportline stopwatch,"This timer and stopwatch is very high quality with a better-than-average flat lanyard and a plastic buckle. Three line screen has large enough numbers and backlight for dark environments. As good or even better than my old Sportline 461 but able to hold up to 300 lap times. It reports the fastest, slowest and average lap times. Buttons operate softly but with positive action. Not sure how this brand is rated but its products are very reliable"
4,"Tried it, decided to go one size bigger","Doesn't have a 3D Y/C filter (just a std 3d filter), also the RGB Input appears to be good for only 640x480@60Hz. Even so, pretty good picture and whatnot for the price, I decided to go with the C32V22 (same TV, but with bigger tube and 3D Y/C filter).You can get around the limited number of HD component inputs with a basic video switchbox - these use RCA jacks, and if you look at your component cables, they have RCA connectors. I'm using one so that I can tune into a HD cable box and/or progressive-scan DVD player without unplugging/re-plugging cables, working just fine (so far)."
2,Whats all the hoopla,"This movie was very disappointing to me. I read all the reviews but I must have missed somthing. Long, drawn out and never an up beat moment. Sean Penn appears for 3 minutes."
1,Wish Bear Presents the Big Star Round-up,The Care Bear was a big hit! My daughter loved it.The movie was not age appropriate. There were Demons with red eyes being unleashed unto the Care Bears. My daughter asked why the Monster's would try to hurt the Care Bears. This was a children's movie targeted for 2 to 5 year olds. This movie will go into our trash bin. I am outraged.
3,Has a market but not for everyone,"I got this book and liked some of the ideas. It was great when I was a newlywed who couldn't cook and was intimidated. As I learned to cook and after my mother came to live with us I outgrew this book.My mother liked to cook as long as she did not have to everyday. So I learned a lot from her and as I began to dislike cooking with convenience items and began cocking with more fresh organic fish, poultry fruits and vegatables I found myself using this less and less.I finally gave it to my best friends brother who is a bachelor and has little time to cook and he loves it. I think this has a market I suggest figuring out if this is designed for you."
1,A disappointment.,"It was so small and the quality is so cheap. It was light and the cover was filmsy. You can't really cook much on it. After one use, I didn't even bother with it; I just donate it. Don't waste your money on this product like I did."
2,NOT WHAT IT COOKS UP TO BE,Does it cook fast? YES. Does it taste like it was grilled? NO. Does it warm bread? YES. Does it toast the the bun? NO. Does it make the bread soggy? YES. Does it make good grilled cheese sandwiches? YES (if you like dry ones) NO (if you like moist ones). Does it seal the flavor in? NO. Does it char the exterior? YES. Does it make meat taste bland? YES. Does the food stick? NO. Is it easy to clean? YES. Does it drain the fat? YES (if you buy fatty food). NO (if you do not buy fatty food). Would I buy it again? NO. Would I recommend? NO (Try before you buy).
4,A Dieters must have,This is a must have if you are monitoring your fat intake. It works especially well with fish. It is easy to clean and easy to store.
1,Disappointed,"This thing extremely small, even though it looks like it's larger cousins. You can only put 4 pieces of bacon in it at a time, so it takes forever to cook through a pack."
3,A good first step to what's coming next,"This book looks at sixty trends the author sees as being one of the next big things. Hill doesn't go for the bigger ""mega-trends"" but takes those and picks out smaller more manageable, personal trends. Some of these in no particular order are: interconnectedness, Peter Pan-ism and mercenary management. For each trend he gives the factors and factoids, implications and the opportunity. This gives you what he thinks are what the facts are, what it means and how you can use it. This gives the book a usefulness that is good. The problem I have is that I see some of the trends as not that useful or groundbreaking. Some of them also have a duh factor. As in duh tell me something I don't know. I suppose with 60 trends this is inevitable and it does give the book a something for everybody quality. Overall I give the book a B-. A useful first step if you want to see what might be coming next but I wouldn't bet the farm on anything in this book by itself."
3,Comparing the price,"Price wise, it's cheaper than what Saphora offers. I already have murad pomegranate cream with spf 15, which I love it. It's not greasy. However, For night, I use Amere Pacific peel. After cleansing my face, then I go applying a faceshop spot corrector that has alcohol ingredient because of my pimple problem. And then I apply Murad Perfecting Night cream. And now my skin tone looks bright and bright everyday."
1,Not Impressed,"Not impressed, chipped and missing teeth after a week or two.You will go broke saving money on these blades; just like I did.I thought they were a really good deal so I invested everything I had in them.But after their teeth came up missing I could not afford the dental bills.I had to start making payments. This cut into what I could spend for entertainment for my wife and I so she soon left me. Now I am homeless and just push these miserable blades around in a grocery cart."
1,A waste of money,"I bought it for my sister's 40th birthday. Luckily, I read it when it arrived instead of wrapping it and giving it to her.She won't be receiving it, but the trash will be. The book isn't even remotely humorous and many of the poems, whichI felt were badly written, left me scratching my head."
2,Disappointing,"Not what I expected. This book seems to be a mesh of various excerpts from several sources put together all not to well. I will Definetly search for another book on Angels with the hope that I find something a lot more indepth. If you are seeking a book along a Christian/Biblical ""scriptual line""--then don't waste your money and time."
5,loved this book,This is a book I loan out to people over and over again. Clear explanations of so much. I love the effort and research this author puts into his work!
5,We're having a blast!,"My husband and I play and we love it. It's great that we can make our own characters and then beat up on each other! I'm sure there's lots more for us to figure out, but so far it's great fun!"
3,Not bad for the price!,"I've always been a huge Mortal Kombat fan and was excited to try it on the Wii.It's a little old so the graphics might not be like the newer games, however for those who are fans of the game/ movies and know who the characters are, I suggest trying it out.Personally, I find it a little challenging to learn the new moves using the nunchuck and Wii remote, but once you master that I think it is probably a lot more enjoyable. Oh, it also has Motor Kombat, which is cute.P.s - Very bloody!"
3,Nice game but the Wii controls are not that easy,"In paper it looks that doing moves and fatalities will be very cool with the Wii Controls, but they don't. All the basic moves are easy to do, but fatalities, if you try to do something, most times the system will do something different or it won't work at all. This is very frustrating. I might get a Virtual Console game pad, but there is no game pad fatality list available at the Internet. The game will tell you the basic moves itself but the fatalities you have to search at the web. The Wii control fatality list is available, but no for the GCN or Virtual Console game pad yet.I had great expectations for this game, I had some satisfaction, but it is frustrating trying to do fatalities (somes in specific) and watch something else to happen"
3,It's sweet,This CD reminds me of summer camp . . . we played many of these tunes for fun. It would be wonderful to hear Mr. Harrell play Cole Porter with another cellist. That would be prima!
4,Need help making space for God in your life?,"Life is hectic--so hectic that we have to make a real effort to stay connected to the things that matter. Don Postema's book is a basic primer for those who want to include God in their lives. He gently teaches readers how to meditate, pray, and listen to God. Includes art of Van Gogh, excerpts from the writings of great Christian thinkers, and insights from Postema's own experience as a pastor and disciple of Christ. A Christian classic in the Reformed tradition."
4,Wake Up,"I workout everyday at 5 A.M due to my heavy schedule, and it works great. Never fails to wake me up. I would avoid to take it at night time (maybe just half the amount), however."
3,"Good for the workout, but good Lord that flavor","Part of me thinks that some of the workout benefits are overstated and that most of the benefit comes from good ol' caffeine; after a dose of this, you'll be flying from the caffeine, but I could certainly be wrong on that count. What I do know is that the fruit punch is one of the vilest-tasting things I've ever consumed (and I've eaten a deep-fried scorpion).I generally try to drink it with a straw that's as far into my mouth as possible so as to avoid as many taste buds as possible. If I could use a beer bong to drink this, I would."
3,Tastes horrible but works well,"After taking Noxplode for a while this feels as if it has a little extra kick, but the taste of watermelon is gross. If you thought fruit punch was bad, believe me this is worst, tastes like chalk. But, I'm not taking it to enjoy the taste, so overall I like it and the results it gives me in the gym. Feel like i can lift for 2+ hours without tiring out and with lots of focus"
5,no xplode,Great price w free shipping. Definelty does the job for a pre workout drink. Not sure if i prefer this or jack3d though. Have tried both and both work pretty well for me.
5,Perfect,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a workout supplement. I used Jack3d before (lemon lime flavor) it was nasty but got the job done. Since Jack3d changed their formula, I wanted to give this a try. I am glad I did."
3,Pretty good preworkout supp,I bought this as a pre-workout supplement trying to get a better pump and more out of my workouts. In terms of pump this is a good supplement and it tastes pretty good too (I got blue raz).. the only negative i have for this is that it has a bunch of caffeine and sometimes gives me the jitters.
2,Avoid this product,"I took NO-Xplode for about a month and I would not recommend buying it. I've taken Jack3d(DMAA version) and C4 which were far superior to NO-Xplode.About 15 minutes after taking NO-Xplode I would basically void my bowels, guaranteed. It was like clockwork. No one likes taking a dump at the gym before they workout.The scoops are huge compared to Jack3d and C4. The taste is fine though.This product is also pretty expensive when compared to others.Overall I did not see a difference in my workout performace (pump, energy, focus, etc.) and regret wasting my money."
2,"Good, but not good enough","My pre-workout for awhile was Hemo Rage Ultra Concentrated, It was amazing but I had to stop because it was giving me nose bleeds. So I went with N.O.-Xplode. The taste is not too good, the only way I can put it is that it taste's like a tree. I weigh 160 pounds and to get any results you have to take at least 2 scoops. For the money I'd say it is not worth it, better off going with Hemo Rage for the real bang for your buck."
2,You are way better off using a knife,"This works, but in most cases it is more trouble than using a knife. Unless you have some reason to actually want to use it for the fancy wave cuts. It is very difficult to clean, especially at the part where the wires fan out from. It also tends to either leave too much avocado behind attached to the skin, unless you really make an effort to force it along the skin, and then sometimes you end up with bits of skin attached."
2,Liked it till it broke,"I liked this DVD recorder for awhile, it just didn't last very long. For the $$ spent, would have expected it to last more than a couple of years. Can't afford to replace an item like this every couple of years. My mom has a cheapo Wal-Mart DVD player that has lasted way longer than my nice player/recorder. Are the recorders just prone to breaking down?"
1,Won't read disks,From the get go I've had problems with this unit not wanting to read ANY disks. It started itermittently and got progressively worse. Of course when I called LG about the unit 6 months into these issues I'm greeted with the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. To the trash can it goes. What a shame. It had everything that I wanted in a DVD player but was completely unreliable. I'll go back to $50 DVD players. Don't buy this unit. It's junk.
3,Mildly amusing,"Lori Mann's guide is mildly amusing and provides an interesting (and useful) look at the world of internet porn photography. Unfortunately, for those who look to this field as a ""get rich quick"" scheme, her advice probably will not be welcome. Nevertheless, if you do what she says you can probably make a few bucks. Note that Lori's primary business is boudoir photography at which she seems to be very successful."
2,the beginning of advertising Sergio as we know it,"This book would be better off as an entry in the 'Idiot's Guide' series. Not because Zyman is an idiot. He's quite smart. but because it's just a basic primer about how advertising works. Anyone beyond an Assistant Brand Manager role at any decent company knows this stuff cold. And, in my experience dealing with agencies, so do most mid-level and above ad people. Basically, he's selling himself. Every chapter contains tales of his great ideas and the 'visionaires' who agree with him (some of them dead.)Still, Sergio managed a 6-figure advance for a thin book with college-level information. Now, that's smart. Oh, and by the way: that's marketing."
1,End of advetising??? Interesting but unrealistic,"For anyone involved in advertising this book provides very interesting read. . Overall not impressed with the content and lack of substance. More marketing than substance! I preferred High Intensity Marketing by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with solid, meaty real world marketing insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books."
3,More Songs with Singing limit Style,"Normally Happy the Man has very few songs per CD with any singing. Their true power is in their offbeat, highly technical yet repeatable jazz rock. When they do have a song with someone singing, I believe its Stanley Whitaker, the style changes to fit. The best example is ""Wind Up Doll Day Wind"" on the CD ""Crafty Hands"" where the singing matches the style of music. This 3rd CD ""Better Late"" tries to intermix their normal music with a singing voice that doesn't quite work. Stanley Whitaker doesn't have the emotional power or range to pull it off, or his singing bogs down the flow. A must for Happy the Man fans but new comers try the first 2 Arista Records now on ""One Way"" records."
2,Not Sure Where to Go From Here,"I was very excited when I got the book and my working through it started out great. However, I got stuck in one part of it and tried everything I could to get unstuck to no avail. I then tried to contact the author with the contact information offered and never got a response. I tried repeatedly and got back nothing. The book is now sitting on my shelf and I still don't know as much about Pro Tools as I need to know."
4,Hybrid wolf/vamp with a biological clock that ticks like any human female,"Every womans nightmare happens to Riley when she wakes up tied up and naked, after being kidnapped by someone who wants to impregnate her.This leads into a story of clones and genetic reproduction, which has the feeing of a mad scientist , but on a larger much more repugnant scale. I like her feistyness and her inability to not destroy every car she drives. Her love/sex life is more than a little on the free side, which she expects any boyfriend to just accept, because it is part of her and her wolf. It is interesting to see the writer introduce Rileys very human female type of clock ticking baby wanting frame of mind, which is something other supernatural heroines tend not to think about. I really enjoyed the book."
5,Best Melodic Metal/Grind Album Ever.,"well ladies and gentlemen..yes. there is a best metal/grind album ever, and it is this one. pick it up. i have listened to it many many of times and i promise you you will never get sick of this album. if you do enjoy this, listen to from a second story window."
4,Great starter telescope,"Here's the skinny: the telescope was easy to assemble and learning the ropes was somewhat easy with the included DVD. After using it for about two weeks one of the gear mechanisms failed and I was forced to return it. The Autostar feature is cool and after aligning the scope, you can search the heavens for a boatload of objects in the sky. One evening I was able to get a clear view of Jupiter and some cloud bands. I also saw four of its moons (which looked liked four pinpoints next to the huge planet). That's pretty cool if you ask me.All in all the telescope worked fine up until it stopped working."
1,Great Movie! Lame DVD,"New Concorde, aka the worst company putting out cult DVDs still can't figure out how to not release things in pan and scan. Maybe one day I will actually buy some of their releases when the do it the right way. Why bother having a commentary. Why bother putting it out at all. WHY??!!"
3,Fun movie,"I just saw ""Crazy Mama"" yesterday on a theatre (actually, not a commercial theatre but the Lisbon Cinemateca).The movie is a lot of fun, a good ""road movie"", and clearly Demme has talent and avoids many of the technical or stylistic ""pitfalls"" that are unfortunately common on 70's cinema (hand-held camera, zoom, etc).Tha actors are well directed and the humour is kept on a restrained level, without over-the-top performances or situations that would be easy to do in a movie of this type.What intrigues me is the format issue. The DVD is not widescreen, and a viewer said it was ""pan-and-scan"". But the fact is the copy I saw yesterday was not widescreen either, and visually it didn't look ""pan-adn-scan""! And on IMDB, there is no mention to the picture's original format, but the DVD is referred to as ""pan-and-scan"".Will anyone help me on this?"
5,A Great Story of Redemption!!,"This movie is a great story of redemption about a car thief who lands into Boystown.Starring Art Carney,it's a must see!!"
3,Depressed Sting,"This is a live concert DVD recorded at Sting's home in Italy on September 11, 2001. Like all of us, Sting felt horrible on 9/11 and did not feel like he should go on and sing.His performance is somber and restrained. It does not look like he was enjoying himself-which is understandable under the circumstances. Most of the songs on the DVD are new jazzy arrangements except for a few like ""Everything She Does is Magic,"" ""Shape of My Heart,"" and ""If I Ever Loose My Faith in You."" There is a good live version of ""Desert Rose"" included in the documentary.""All This Time"" would have been a great concert DVD if it was not coincidently recorded on that most horrific day in our country's history. Sting's mind and heart was definitely elsewhere. This is an interesting concert but a bit disappointing."
2,"Sturdy hitch ball, but...","Bought this to pull heavier loads, but have only used it on a light trailer so far. In the picture, it has a satin finish and looks like stainless, but the description correctly says it's chrome plated. It seems robust enough, but after only one use much of the chrome has already worn off, even though a light coat of grease was applied before use. I wouldn't recommend this ball because of the poor quality of the chrome plating. My lighter-duty Reese hitch ball purchased at the local Walmart has better chrome plating and looks nicer after years of use."
3,left hanging,"This book is not bad but, The lessons seem to have a lot of steps left out of almost every lesson. I found it hard to follow a long. One minute the page has a sort of ugly sketch to follow a long with. Tun the page and that sketch has been turned into a very realistic painting with no real explanation as to how it got that way. I think this book is better if you already know what your doing when it comes to painting realistic characters and designing them, but then one could argue whats the point in getting this book also seeing as it cost a bit munch."
2,Perfume is awful,"Just purchased L'Oreal Age Perfect Day 2.5 oz, but cannot wear it because of the perfume, which smells like insecticide, and the smell stays with you for many hours. Otherwise product seems to perform well. I do use their Revitalift series, where the perfume is mild, not this type of grassy scent, and would use this one if it came in a non-perfumed version."
1,Doesn't hold air! Try another brand!,"Last summer we had a swim sweater for my daughter. It was wonderful. After sitting all winter it would no longer inflate. I couldn't find another swim sweater so, I then bought the Swim School Deluxe Tot Trainer with Pants to use for my youngest son. The first one I purchase was deflated by the time we walked from our garage to the pool. I was very dissapointed but figured it was a fluke. I exchanged it for a new one. This time it lasted about a week or three trips to the pool. Needless to say I am very dissapointed in the quality. The concept is great. My son was all over the pool independently and loving it! I replaced the Tot Trainer with a Swim Tee and am hoping for better results!"
4,somewhat disappointed,"I have 2 small boys who use these for swimming. When 1 broke this year, I had a hard time even locating another one. I was somewhat disappointed to see the new ones were much smaller that the old ones. The tire is smaller and so they don't stay up as high above the water. The vest is also smaller and much harder to pull on. We really have to stretch. We are making do, but it required adult help now instead of the kids getting dressed themselves."
1,Very disappointed!,"Says that it will fit children up to 4 years old. Could barely get it on a two year old. Caused his face to go towards the water. Like I said, very disappointed."
5,I love this product,"My grandson is 2 years old, It REALLY works...But for some reason it went flat....It wont hold a patch..All in all,I'ts still the best product for the pool...Vickie"
3,Good Product,"I bought this swimming tube for my 20 month old son we weighs...32lbs. At first he could not hold him self up and it was tipping him over...but the trick is to let them build up their confidence and learn to balance. after 2 weeks he was good to go and was swimming all around the pool , trying to jump in....it was wonderful. One issues i have ...it is hard to get on and off...the arm holes are not streching at all. I am gonna try to cut and sew some buttons in it...also it tends to rub him raw between his legs...swimming trunks seem to help with that issue.Overall great product. DO NOT LEAVE IN THE SUN!"
1,What a waste!,"I read the reviews on this product and thought this would be the way to go in helping our 27 month old son get around our inground pool. We followed the manufacter's instructions and inflated it with a bicycle pump to the recommended amount, and it appeared very sturdy. It's rated for ages 2-7 years old, but I couldn't find a weight recommendation. This just did NOT work. He immediately tipped over face first into the water. Our son's about 27 pounds, which shouldn't be too much weight considering the age rating. We had to hold him up the entire time he wore it in the pool, and it did NOT keep his face out of the water, the way it was advertised to. We're returning this and looking for something that does what it says!"
1,dangerous swimming gear,"I see that this item gets a pretty good rating overall, I have to disagree. A friend bought this tot trainer for our son (2 1/2 years old at the time) as a gift about a year ago and of course we tried it out straight away. As soon as we let him float a little, without being held, the rubber ring around the waist tipped and caused a very frightened little boy to tip forward, almost face down in the water! needless to say this item has ended up in the garage where it is safely out of use."
2,Deficient retractable USB port,The USB port does not stay locked in the projecting position to enable tight insertions into the USB ports of computers.
2,One little lame thing,"I haven't used it for much data yet, but it's been fine for what I've done so far...The only problem is that it doesn't come with any way to attach it to your key chain. There is a rod in the end that is too deep to hook even the smallest key ring to and it doesn't come with anything. I had to use a piece of wire to attach it to my keys.I wouldn't buy it again just because of that. A flash drive is pretty much a flash drive, but if it falls off your key chain then it doesn't matter how good it is."
2,NOT durable,"I would give this 0 stars for durability if I could. After only a couple weeks, the plastic casing broke in two. I had to tape it back together, but it's still wobbly and I don't trust it."
4,"Great drive (so far), but no way to attach to key ring","I just bought this Kingston DataTraveler 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DT100/4GB a week or so ago and it is working perfectly. The price was excellent for a 4gb drive. My only complaint is that the place where you are supposed to be able to attach a lanyard or key ring is so small that it is nearly impossible to do so. I managed to snake a bit of dental floss through by poking it with a twist-tie. If anyone has managed to attach this to key ring, I'd love to hear how you did so."
3,"Works fine, but slow","I purchased thwo of thes Kingston DataTraveler 4GB USB 2.0 Flash Drives. They work fine, but data transfer is SIGNIFICANTLY slower than with my SanDisk 4GB Cruzer."
3,Does *not* play nicely with Vista!,"The Data Traveler has performed completely to expectation on my XP system--easy to use, a little slow, perfect for my typical needs (scanned files, Word documents and spreadsheets). It can also take files from my XP system to my Vista system with no problems. But try to load the Data Traveler with large files *from* the Vista system? The files are often corrupted, and about one time in four, the whole system crashes. I never had any problem with my much older Cruzer drive--maybe there's something to be said for that silly U3 software after all...?"
4,Review for Kingston Data traveler 16 GB,"Good product. At first it wasn't working with my computer but that was apparently my computer's problem, which my friend fixed for me. Product arrived very soon after ordered. Thank you."
4,Kingston USB key,This USB key worked perfectly. It was very inexpensive for an 8GB USB key. I like the metal USB keys better but this plastic one works great.
2,delicate,"I bought this strictly for the price, not realizing how delicate the plastic cover is.Have to be very careful not dropping it on hard surface and in a crowded bag. Guaranteed to break! Next time I will buy Sandisk with metal cover."
2,Didn't work,"I don't know why, but it doesn't work on my computer, I tried several computers, all of them ok, except my own :("
1,Does Not Copy Well,"I have used Kingston Datatravelers for years and have been very pleased with them. I am extremely pleased with the 8GB device which copies fast and completely when I back up files and folders. However, I laid out a bit of money for the 16GB model and I was sorely disappointed! It is horrible. Not only is it SLOWER than mountains wearing down but it only seemed to copy some of the files and completely ignored whole sets of folders in the copying process! I have gone through the process 3 times now and my plan is to do something we all would like to do with a piece of technological junk: slam it with a hammer. I have to wonder what the failure rate is on these high capacity Kingston crappers. It is basically useless. DO NOT BUY THIS 16GB MODEL. Check around on the net and see that many others have issues with this data drive."
3,works OK but slow write performance,"I planned to use this drive for backup but had to give up since its write speed is not fast enough.A full backup of about 4.5Gb with 13K files took about 2 hours. So, I decided to buy a portable hard drive that reduced the same backup to 20 minutes. Otherwise this flash drive is fine to me."
3,USB Flash drive,"16 GB USB flash drive was great for the price, however I have to carry it in a case at all times. there is no way I can attach it to a key chain or put it on a rope-to make travel more convenient.I just wish there was an alternative portability. NO FAULT TO THE SELLER."
4,High Capacity - Low Cost,"I purchased 2 of these 16GB Kingston drives. I use them with my WD HD TV video unit, where I load video onto them using my computer, then take them upstairs to the WD HD TV unit to view the videos (movies and tv series). So far, they both have worked 100% perfect. I've got about 15-20 hours ""live"" usage time on each drive so far, and not once have I had a glitch.The ONLY reason I gave it four starts instead of five is this: The plastic housing of this unit feels a little cheap. I am not sure how much abuse this thing can take before it falls apart. In my case, I always treat these things like fragile glass, so hope it stays together. But for those of you who like to put these kind of things in your pocket, throw around, etc., you might find it to be a problem.But if you are gentle and are looking for a high-capacity USB thumb drive, then this is it and the price is outstanding!"
3,"A good flash drive, but hard to hook up to a key chain","The flash drive seems to work fine. The problem is hooking the device to a key chain. It comes with nothing to hook up to the key chain. Supposedly u can put a string through the back of the flash drive and tie that to your key chain. I finally got this to work, but it feels very flimsy. I am satisfied with this product as a flash drive, but if you plan on hooking it up to a key chain, I would not reccomend this."
3,no key chain attackment,good price ... but feels light and a bit flimsy ... and they did not even include a keychain attachmentment i had to use one of my old from from a sandisk model
2,Retractable feature not good,The retractable feature actually makes this USB difficult to use. It's hard to insert it into my computer.
2,Design and function - poor,"It's not easy to plug this thing into a USB port; the lever sticks and is hard to extend and retract the connector; the connector end retracts when inserting into the USB port; it's not stable; you have to hold onto the lever strongly in order to have it insert properly. There is a place on the other end to run a lanyard through but extremely difficult to accomplish. The price is right but the design and function of this thumb drive is extremely poor! Transfer of files is slow as well. I should have returned it but didn't. The work sleek used to describe this drive is more like ""flimsy"". I have the Kingston DataTraveler in a 1GB and really like it - sturdier, has a cap as a place on the end to easily insert a lanyard. And it's fast. Too bad this one is ""chintzy"". In this case, I got what I paid for."
1,horrible..................,"This movie is really bad, the elves so cheesy you will want to cry, the scripting terrible. Sadly, this movie had a lot of potential, Martin Short is normally funny, but not in this garbadge, the first time I put it on, I turned it off 40 minutes later, stricken by how bad it was.This movie would be fine for little kids with short attention spans but I don't think the majority of adults would be able to watch this.The plot could've been good too, the other Santas were good movies, this one had Martin S as Jack Frost, sounds interesting right? If you want to waste 20 dollars then this a perfect way to do so."
2,Did anyone want to be there?,"It seemed as if the actors didn't even want to be there. Very little emotion in this movie. The movie also seemed to be slapped together quickly. Frost, I think, was the best character, but with a PG rated, how funny can you get? The North Pole was a depressing, child labor factory. Almost all jokes were very lame and the movie was slow paced. I recommend a DVD rental only."
5,One of the best Christmas Movie,I went and took my son to this movie last November and he really loved it. That is why I bought it for him this Christmas.
2,Another evil Disney villain,"I was disappointed in the Jack Frost character, which I think could have been mischeivous and spunky and funny, but instead frightened my five-year-old. The character reminded me of Jim Carrey's character in one of the Batman movies, only with more malevolence. The story line was ho-hum. There were a few funny moments, but mostly I just wanted the movie to be over. I may give the movie another try when it comes out on DVD. My suggestions to you are to a) not take young or easily frightened children to see this in the theater (my child is quite sensitive, but then, so many children are) and b) unless you are a huge fan of Christmas movies, wait for the DVD next year."
2,not as great as the first one!,"Perhaps, I shouldn't have waste my time watching this movie. I thought it would be funny based on the preview. When I went to watch this movie on Saturday, I did not find one scene funny at all. The only funny stuff in this movie was the bloopers. Overall, the movie just sucks! It wasn't that great as the first one. The first one was more funnier. The second one was good too, but this one was just not that great. It was okay and all but it just wasn't that funny. I personally think that I should have seen Borat instead of this movie. At least, I would have something to laugh about! I miss the 90s! They used to have such good movies that were much more funnier! If anyone want to see a good Christmas movie, I would recommend Home Alone 1,2, Miracle on 34th Street, and The Santa Clause 1,2."
4,Good Christmas Movie,"Not the best of the series, but still worth watching.I think you will enjoy it as did I.I purchased it primarily so that I would have the entire set."
5,Satisfying on all fronts,"This film was not only very entertaining, and not the least for a look back at some enduring film stars, the plot kept me engaged throughout. Attention is required but certainly worth it. Seeing the jingoist Shand make his case for more than a ""hot dog"" in this satisfying crime drama gives this period piece an authenticity that the newer Brit crime fliks lack ( though I do love them, too). If you like Lock, Stock...,Snatch and the others, you should enjoy this earlier view of London's underworld. And Hoskins does tough good. Real good."
4,Could not put it down,"Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give is to say that from about mid-way I could not put it down; the story and characters really got a hold on me. The dialog is terrific, and I felt strongly about the 'players' from the beginning (something very important to me as a reader)."
5,Good book!,"This story of a widow with too many responsibilities and the true cynical, high powered man made me laugh, say, ""Oh No!"", and wonder how it would end. I even liked the dog."
3,"Another ""Losfer Words""?","Another CD of instrumentils only? That can't go too far! It's not like Mr. Five can't locate a singer: working with the likes of David Lee Roth, Rob Halford, Trent Reznor, Marilyn, and now Rob Zombie it's obvious he has connections. For his third CD John 5 should do what Tony Iommi and Dave Grol did for their debut solo projects and hire a different singer for each track. ""Iommi"" (2000) and ""Probot"" (04) are two of the best metal CDs this decade, mainly because of their diversity.John 5 (with diverse singers) could easily give us an album of equal greatness."
5,Great Book,If you own an Australian Shepherd this book is handy. Since my Aussie is the smartest dog I've ever owned its nice having a little professional help and some good insights into the breed. Without this book I wouldn't stand a chance of being top dog in my house.
5,Best food I've had in a long time,This Grill is awesome. Got it in from Amazon.com today and cooked with it tonight. Haven't had better burgers anywhere. They were so tender. I can't wait to cook more things on this grill. If you don't have one this is a MUST for every houshold.
4,Good for College,"You wanna burger? Just grill one up. Small enough to hide from RAs, but still gets the job done!"
4,Eh,"While this is a good item for people such as myself that have no cooking skills whatsoever, anyone else with the slightest amount of cooking skills should look elsewhere.I like it because I live in a studio apartment and have limited counter space in my kitchen. I also like it because one person doesn't have to make a big production just to cook enough food for one.The thing I don't like is the ""bun warmer"". It really didn't warm the buns even the slightest bit. That part seems rather useless to me.Other than that, it's a decent cooking tool for bachelor's such as myself with no cooking skills"
4,Size matters!,"This little unit does its job perfectly. It's compact, convenient, simple to use and easy to clean! The only downside is the size -- even when cooking one meal for one person, this unit can too small for the job! Want two burgers? You have to do them separately or break one in half.Definitely get and use the Foreman grill ... but give serious thought to a larger size!"
4,What an Apartment or Dorm Shouldn't Be Without...,"I bought this grill over the past weekend, and yes, I have used it to cook hot dogs. The appliance itself is a bit weak...the heat distribution is all over the place. The sweet spot on the grill is in the centre -- and should you have to move the food to places other than the centre, the food will be cooked unevenly.The pros of this little machine is: 1) Relatively inexpensive. 2) It does grill food w/o setting your apartment/dorm on fire. 3) The food does come out hot! 4) Relatively small footprint. 5) Cool colors. Matches your iMac should you happen to have one. Just don't confuse this appliance with your iMac! :)The cons: 1) Requires a lot of ""energy"" coursing through the machine. Can you say ""electricity""? 2) The heat distribution is quite uneven, even for a small unit. 3) Hinges are NOT durable per se. The unit is loosely constructed.Overall 4/5 stars."
3,Great Filming but Where Is the Information?,"This was an amazing filming experience. We loved the pictures and where all they took us. We had bought it for more of an educational experience though and we were so disappointed not to have the film makers comment more on what we were seeing! There was so much they could have been telling us. We hope they remake it using the same film, but adding in all the information."
5,Wow!,"Simply stunning. And if you have a HD/Widescreen TV, even better! The picture is crystal-clear, the content dramatic and much more than just an ordinary documentary. I constantly wondered throughout the program how they got the shots of the birds, and the stories behind each type of bird migration really boggle the mind. Amazing, compelling, you name it; this movie is a sight to behold."
5,winged,Video was well done. The inflight closeups of the migrating birds was spectcular. Was a bit too long and became boring but not to take away from the quality of the program. The bits and pieces of pollution really struck home. Those parts you do not forget. I had seen parts of the video a another location and decided to purchase my own copy to keep and loan.Well done...thanks
4,lovely,"This was a very relaxing and beautiful DVD. The photography was amazing and left us wondering ""how did they get that shot?""Absolutely stunning. I donated at copy to our local Nature Center."
5,Simply Beatiful,"Winged Migration is a beautiful documentary about birds migrating to warmer climates during the winter. Yes we all know this happens but how many of us are aware of the perils they face on the journey? Do we know how many of them actually make the journey to and from their destinations? Well I certainly was not aware of all this before the documentary. I had just taken it for granted that a bunch of birds just got up early one morning and flew away. It did not even occur to me the miles and miles they would have to fly just to find food and keep living. In all this film was very informative about beatiful creature we take for granted while we are down on earth destroying it the best way we can. For those who saw this venture as pointless...they need to take their heads out of the dark hole, look to the skies and experience a mind migration of their own."
1,"Still haven't received the product, first item was received broken and returned","Winged Migration was ordered over a month ago, received broken, returned, and, as of this date it hasn't been received."
2,Booooring,"It's like a 90-minute screensaver with bad music. Yeah, for a few minutes you're thinking, ""Wow, how did they get that shot,"" and there are a few really funny moments, but how many shots of birds flying can you watch.The music is really annoying; it sounds like they ... some poor boy to get the vocals.And the narrator has a really jarring French accent: ..."
1,REALLY Disappointed!,"With all the awards for this documentary video, I was expecting something great! It wasn't... it was awful!!! Scenes looked Photoshopped and overall the piece was boring - and I love nature. Save your money; don't purchase."
4,WOW!,"AMAZING video, insightful factoids. I feel more connected to the birds, their migration and nature after watching it. It strengthened my respect for all of the birds. The DVD resolution on my plasma TV isn't as clear or detailed as when I watched the broadcast in HD, and with a show that is so majestic both with scenery and detail of the birds' feathers and eyes, it is a big loss. You have to suspend belief for a few of the scenes (like with the horses, or the car in the desert) because they are clearly ""set-up"" by the filmmakers, but these are probably less than 10 percent of the show and the rest seems authentic."
1,A Cheat,"1. The fact that the birds were trained maekes this film no more exceptional than filming dogs or caged parrots.2. ""Winged"" is a disingenuous attempt to move the viewer toward a pro ""nature"" stance. Or maybe its just an attempt to win awards. Either way, the Wellsian, Dr. Moreau training of birds so they can be filmed ""natural"" is a major joke.3. Birds are better from afar. Some of the closeup footage of these robo-birds shows the glassy eyes that come from Skinner conditioning.4. The film and th etechnique of making it is only slightly less disgusting than Frankenstein. And if you believe birds are as good as humans (or better! as some wackos think), then ""Winged"" is worse than Frankenstein.5. In short, the film is inhuman!"
5,"Amazing, a real keeper","This film is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen... truly it will make you feel like you yourself can sour above the earth amongst the clouds. It is completely captivating and in parts very moving, it's the kind of film you can watch again and again and always notice things you didn't see the last time. Whether you love birds or not, you will walk away from a viewing of this film with a renewed appreciation for birds and a greater understanding of their lives. It captures the beauty of these creatures in a rare way that not many other films have been able to do.One thing I especially loved about this film was its music, so much so that it put me on a search for more work of the same composer (Bruno Coulais).I really recommend seeing this one, to people of all ages. It's a winner for sure."
4,"review of ""winged migrration""","this documentary was oscar nomicated, and for good reason. the flight footage is incredible! i wondered how could they have obtained such footage. i was somewhat disappointed when i learned the imprinted birds were used. nevertheless, and wonderful insight into magnificent creatures and thier travels."
5,Absolutely spellbinding!,"""Winged Migration"" is the video equivalent of relaxation audio programs. This is not a 'watch-once-and-put-on-the-shelf' kind of video, rather being one that adults and children alike will enjoy watching again and again. If you love nature, but can't get out as often as you like, this video is an excellent substitute (without the mosquitos).We bought a second copy and gave it to our daughter who owns and operates a child care business. It is an excellent video experience for children of all ages."
4,Nature is awesome,"I picked up Winged Migration since it had some good reviews. I did not know much about the film when I popped the DVD into the player. As it unfolded, the videography was stunning. I did not know how such excellent footage could be taken of birds in flight, at tremendous altitudes and conditions. Then I viewed the special features on the DVD and the story behind the film was even more amazing. It demonstrates our relationship with animals and our planet that many of us do not appreciate, it shows to me the dedication of the film makers and others to create a gift to the world, and it shows to me what we can create wtth nature when we work with it. The video is fantastic, and the story behind the video, a miracle in our midst. Well worth watching, and reflecting on our relatonship with nature."
2,Good screen saver,"If you just want to see a great video of birds in their own element, this is great. If you want to learn something about the migration of birds, get a BBC or other such documentary film. Very little narration, but great shots of birds flying and such. A joy to watch, but not much for listening to or learning anything new about birds."
5,Awesome documentary,This film will mesmerize you. It is an awesome film capturing the migration of birds worldwide. A must see for nature lovers!!
4,Visually stunning!,"Spectacular cinematographyIt's like nothing I have ever seen. I expected more of a documentary since I live on documentaries but it was pleasantly refreshing just to hear a few words narration and just watch all the different birds as if I was there myself, observing them in their habitat and flying right along with them. Unbelievable footage. Only giving 4 stars as I would have preferred it with just some musical background and no singing."
4,Nonna,"I bought this buggy for my 2 yr old granddaughter. It has nice rubber wheels so can be used indoors. If it was a little wider, it would be easier to control. The liner slips off easily. Sturdy construction. I pleased with it."
3,expectations too high,"I guess I was expecting way more content in this book. Nothing new here but I was hoping for some info that might cross the lines that might apply to children with difficulties such as high functioning autism. No, they are just not ever included in books like this. :("
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Braineater plan change.Having acted against Earth wishes in trying to get rid of his enemy, Gaborn isn't as superpowerful as before, but still will try and get rid of the Reavers.A kid gives him surprising new information gained from eating the brain of a dead 'un. Yum.So, a underground Reaver bash, is what comes next, to try and remove the menace before their super-wizard runs amok with an army."
4,Keep them coming!,"Much better than the previous installment of Brotherhood of the Wolf. I really enjoyed this book and I'm anxiously awaiting reading The Lair of Bones. The world building, monsters and fighting are outstanding. Keep them coming."
1,The worst set of short films I have ever seen...,"I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would find some interesting short films. What I got instead in the 2nd worst DVD I have ever bought. Most of the short films in this collection are mindlessly boring beyond belief (I kept finding myself hitting the fastword button), with the exception of three. Definately not worth the price of the DVD. If you're looking for good quality short films, look elsewhere - you won't find much here. Having seen this DVD once, I will never watch it again (yes, it's that bad)."
1,Rusted out within hours,"I used mine exactly once. The bacon was good. After cooling, I left the press next to my sink to wash. Some hours later, I noticed that the top of the press was newly rusted in a few spots. Lifting the press, the bottom was very rusty and now I have a nasty rust stain on my counter top to scrub off. I should have thought about what ""cast iron"" implied, but it's designed for cooking. I'd expect it to be anodized or something. Rust has no place touching my food. Returned, 1/5."
2,Rust Problem,"Seemed like a good item, but impossible to keep rust-free even after ""seasoning."" No issues with my other similar cast iron items, so this was disappointing. If not for the rust problem it worked well, flattening out pannini sandwiches and bacon. Too bad!"
5,FABULOUS PRODUCT,"Absolutely love this bacon grill press. Always wanted one, and saw this one online, cast iron, which I almost exclusively cook with, at a great price and also shipping was very reasonable and was surprised at how quickly it arrived. Have used 2 or 3 times a week since I have received it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who cooks a lot of bacon on the stovetop. Thinking about getting a second bacon press. Enjoy!"
5,Review for Norpro Round Bacon Press,I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift for my boyfriend. He loves it and I used it for the first time yesterday I thought it worked very well. The bacon cooked evenly on both sides.
2,At least the music was worthwhile.,"There's one reason and one reason only that I bring CANDY STRIPE NURSES to your attention -- its connection to another movie that's both more famous and rather infamous. The opening credits for NURSES attribute the music to the duo of Thompson and Tabor. It turns out that Tabor is none other than Eron Tabor, the actor who played one of the four rapists (Johnny, the gas station guy) in I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. (My source is the commentary on the Millennium Edition DVD of GRAVE.) Unfortunately, there's no way to tell how much of the music was composed by Mr. Tabor. Also unfortunately -- but not surprisingly -- there was no attempt to enhance the soundtrack for the DVD release, and there's significant wow in the music throughout.As far as the movie itself goes, it's an attempt to graft serious drama onto silly sex comedy, and in my opinion, the graft didn't take."
5,A story of samurai spirit with a romantic twist.,"This is a story of a low ranking samurai who sustained blindness at work(as a official food tester), and tried to cope with the ensuing physical, psychological and social impairment in a feudal society. The plot unfolds in an unhurried pace, but not slow. The sword fighting, while not spectacular, is realistic and suspenseful, devoid of special effects and improbable feats typical of samurai movie genre. The acting and scenes are nuanced and reserved, with occasional stunted humor. The love story line is somewhat stereotypical in the male chauvinistic tradition and predictable, but nevertheless engaging emotionally. A- and 2 thumbs up."
5,einfach super!--simply super!,"As a native citizen of Germany, I can testify that the book ""Let's go Germany"" is quite remarkable. My wife Hilda and I are frequently underway in Germany and we find this book very useful and organized in a logical and humourous fashion. In particular the chapter of my ""home town"" (Berlin) is quite contemporary and extensive. Also, the research of known only to German vacationers resorts like Frisia-islands and ""holstein switzerland"" is very good. We hope, that other travellers will be able to have enjoyment from this book as well. Best, H. Müller"
5,Best in the West,"These shears are tough, versatile, and handsome. They take apart so they are easy to clean. They have a notch on the blades to capture bones or other hard stuff, like rose stems. They have a can opener and flat screw-driver-type extension on the handle. Quality shears."
4,Love these shears,"They work great, are sharp and perfect for cutting chicken breasts. I wish they didn't come apart though, otherwise, perfect."
3,Pretty Pictures.,"This book has great picture to inspire. Mostly upscale patios, swimming pools, and a few decks. There is some practical information in the front and back on construction but this is NOT a do it yourself manual. The desing credits are 2 pages. A good book to decide what you want so that you can hire the job(s) out. This book is for the person with good taste and the money to go for it."
2,Ok. For a daily log but....not an interesting read.,"I have read tons of sailing books and I found this author spent far too much time complaining about having to bail his constantly leaking boat when he passes dozens, if not hundreds, of ports along the way that he could have stopped at to get it fixed. If you chose not to fix something then stop complaining about it page after page. Since he seemed bent on not stopping, the book lacked interesting stories of people and places he visited along the way and we were stuck listening to a guy give a daily log of the weather, his thoughts and complaints of how hard his trip was and how poorly built his boat was. It was just interesting enough for me to finish reading it, but I was glad when it was finally over. Others seemed to give it good reviews but it just wasn't my type of book."
2,Sailor's Story,"Unless you are a sailor, with your own sailboat, alot of the technical descriptions of what was happening as the author sailed around the world was lost in understanding what actually was happening. Natical terminology was hard to understand, and whenever the author used terms to discribe the various sails and steerage of the boat, it was difficult to fully understand what was going on. The actual events which occurred during his voyage, other than the technical descriptions were interesting, but the story ended rather abruptly before he returned to his home port. Perhaps he didn't feel the need to bring that closeure to his story."
1,This is the [explitive deleted]movie ever,"All I can bear to say is that this makes Pearl Harbor Look like The Godfather, ohw my god, I was once siting around watching a dvd of Lord of the rings when it ended i turned the t.v. back to t.v. mode episode of MST3000 this was playing. I complained about it so mutch online that someone on the internet named ""Metroidfan1"" jokingly saidthat he'ld send a copy tome. So I bought the DVD just to spite him. This is truly [not good] -1 out of 10"
1,A music abuse,"It seems and this is SO sad, that people are still amazed when someone's abusing musci. They call this ""personal taste"" but in this case, Argerich, shows no respect for the composers and music. Everything she's doing, is only to impress the audiance and nothing else. Where is the real MUSIC? Where is the passion for truth and honesty? Argerich with Horowitz and Gould are true examples of what is not music. Every student should hear them and know what we shouldn't do. It's shame.. We need to go forward, to see the truth and to be honest. It's so sad, I hope someday, this will change."
5,Spectacular! Nothing will ever compare!!,"Foods and flavors of the 90's that are unrivaled. Sophisticated recipes streamlined for preparation with ease. The most helpful part of the book, and perhaps the most creative, are the suggested menus that are presented with each recipe for fantastic combinations.ORDER IT NOW!!!"
1,Universal Lids,I have the large one tried to use it on coffee.... can't get it to work. Love the rest of the products.
5,I couldn't wait for the next page.... LOVED IT,I loved it.... a very fast paced and well written novel... one fascinating thing is the Bibliography...... is this fiction ??? Read and make your decision........
2,"Neat Idea, but not well focused","I really liked the premise of this book; a team of scientists digging in desert discover an Alien relic. Where did this relic come from? and what was its function? What does this say about ancient history and our world as we know it?The answer to these questions, which weaves fact with fiction is the most fascinating aspect of the story, and makes for a good, intelligent read.Unfortunately, the bulk of the plot is focused on a ridiculous plot involving drug lords, the DEA and many boring sequences in which the bad guys are in hot pursuit of the good guys. I had to skim the last few pages of the book because I was so bored at the end. Not my idea of a good time.In the final analysis, I wish the author focused more on his philosophy, ideas, and imagination regarding the alien relic, rather than try to build an action novel which didnt work."
1,"""LINK"" will find great acceptance among the illiterate.","A splattering of references to scientific fields with no apparent effort at comprehension, artifacts from alien visits, preachy anti-evolution"" nonsense, shallow characters, and a childish plot should make Morrow, the publisher, ashamed. Reads very fast -- because you skip a lot."
5,Loved it!,I use this pan for all kinds of cookies. I don't have the patience for decorating so this allows me to be creative without too much fuss.
2,Not impressed,"The middle part of the mold is really small compared to the rest, my cakes kept breaking in two. So disappointed, its really hard to find good lady finger molds with just the right proportions!"
1,serieously,i havent got this dvd but serieously is it actually 115 dollars i mean come on who wold pay for that
2,COLOR CAST,"I don't know its behavior with film, but with digital cameras, don't put 2 or more Cokin ND Graduated filters, one above the other. The magenta cast is awful and don't try to correct it by modifiying your in camera's color temperature: it will affect the non-filtered area. If one filter isn't enough, try the old and true Photoshop trick: with the camera in a tripod (ideally), take two -or more RAW shots, one for the highlights and one for the shadows (if I have no tripod handy, I use the bracketing and high speed in my camera to take a couple of pictures, trying not to move); then mix them in Photoshop and.... voila!!!! No need to bother with rings, attachments and delicate and easily scratched plastic filters.Added Feb. 3/09The previous review was done with the filters on Canon's 40D and 50D. I have now a Nikon D700 and the magenta cast isn't any more visible. May be ther is an issue with Canon's EF-S sensors."
1,No Home on the Range,No home on the range here. Stay on the ranch and off the shelf please. These Ranch style Pringles Potato Crisps just don't hold the same flavor. The ranch taste and the taste of the basic chips do not mesh. Back to the drawing board and rustle up some better tasting chips is in order here.
4,a meditation.,"This video is a meditation. Campbell's thoughts on life, myth, and religion (excerpts from his lectures) are presented together with images and music that complement them. There are many insights here. The video is both relaxing and thought provoking.There really is no central theme, other than the broad one of myth, religion, and the thoughts of Campbell. For those who have read Campbell's works, there is nothing new here, but the music, images, and Campbell's words fit together nicely."
4,Toddler Health,"The Toddler Health formula is wonderful. It is difficult to have to wait for it on the waiting list, and takes awhile to ship, but is worth it."
4,"It's No Kingdom Come, but seriously, what is?","The art is nice. The story is nice. The covers are absolutely fantastic. This was the most recent Alex Ross work I've read and it was my least favorite. It is a solid read, a better borrow than buy. If you love the Marvel Universe check out ""Marvels."" If you want Ross & co at their best check out ""Kingdom Come"" or the ""Justice"" series."
5,Fine All-Purpose Fry Pan/ Wok,"For three years I have used the Circulon elite hard-anodized 14-inch nonstick stir-fry pan as my main stove-top cooking pan. Not only is it a great high temperature stir fry pan, it also is perfect for omelettes, soups, stews, sautéing. Both small and large cooking tasks can be done in this single pan. Nothing sticks and mine shows no signs of wear after almost daily use for three years. I typically use a 800'F silicone spatula (Cuisinart) which effortlessly moves veggies around and lifts omelettes without hurting the pan surface. I have previously used both steel and nonstick woks and this is by far the best. It cleans up in a twinkling. I use the 14"" glass cover that came with a stock pot and with a domed cover that came with one of my defunct woks. This is a great purchase price for the only indispensable pan in my collection."
1,whisperlite/molotov cocktail,"I bought one of these and it burst into flames after about 10 uses at the pump, I have heard that this has been corrected in later designs. I still wouldn't use it again though. I would recommend the dragonfly, it has suited my needs well and hasn't once caused me any problems."
5,Ripened on The Vine,"Feel somewhat ambivalent about giving this a 5-star review because 5-star is equivalent of ""I love it."" There was so much personal pain and horror, to say I loved it just doesn't feel right. Now, saying I love Michele Davenport does feel right. Ripened on The Vine is a book about her life...one which made me wince as I read but could not put down. Her graphic descriptions made me feel like an eyewitness to her account and all I could think while reading is ""could her life get any worse?"" To my dismay...it did.The good news is this isn't a biography but an autobiography of an astounding overcomer who today shares her story without shame or apology across the nation. She thrives on helping hurting and abused women find not only peace but victory over defeat.Michele may have been dragged through a horrific past but clearly God has escorted her into an amazing future.Getting ready to read ""Choices Are For The Living"" and I can't wait."
4,Almost right,"I did get shorts, that were as described, however, they were not the color I had ordered. I know that they would have been exchanged had I asked, but I wanted them for a special time and the exchange would have not been on time. The shorts I kept, as I needed them. I will not order the same things from the place again. I still like the style of shorts, but will try and find them somewhere else."
2,Walking the Line . . . Again,"Another Christian author walking the line between cool and committed in their lead character. Only had to read about fifteen pages to figure out Caitlin. Flighty, shallow, trying to sound worldly, but shifting into miss goody mode every couple of paragraphs with casual refferences to prayer, trusting in God, etc; etc. Why can't our Christian authors come up with a human -- yet inspiring -- character?"
4,Peek-a-Block TOuch Sensation,Very happy to teach my infant textures. These were useful as we'd already been given a sensation Peek-a-Block set from a friend and my son was familiar with the shape.
4,Good Book,"Up to this time,there are no 5 stars books in Linear Systems. However, this book is one of the best 4 stars books available for the subject. Through the book, the author sometimes assumes that you know or understand some topic, formula,...etc. without mentioning it. However,you can do it, but it may take you some time to figure out what it is. If you are good enough in linear algebra you will have no problems to handle the book up to the last page. Chapter 2 & 3 are the most important chapters in the book because they prepare you for the rest of the book. MATLAB is being used in a nice and helpful way to visualize some concepts and applications of the linear control theory. I recommend this book as a textbook for an introductory linear systems course and also for self teaching purposes."
4,history of Spiritualism - arthur conan doyle,"I have looked for this book for many yrs, as yet I havent read it, but very happy to have it. Shall read as soon as I have finished my other Spiritual books... many thanks Amazon.... Meg"
4,Inspiring!,"I love this book. It is in fact one of the few ""Art Of"" books that I've read from beginning to end, instead of just skimming around for the ""good parts"". For me, it was ALL good parts. The book is filled with amazing artwork. You get to learn some interesting secrets about the movie. And, read about the gang's trip to China, which I found very interesting.If you liked Mulan, like animation or just like art, you definitly should buy this book!"
2,"Great visuals, weak writing","All of the drawings and production stills are beautiful and there's a nice mix of rough drawings and conceptual art along side the final product. The part where I felt short changed was where they actually explained the process of animation. In such a large book neither the steps in animation or the techniques used by the animation staff were explained. Most of the book was focusing on either the trip that the production staff took to China (which went on for way too long), or was exerpts taken describing each character - which if you've seen the movie you don't need to hear. I'm going to be very hesitant before I buy another art of disney book."
4,Great Improvement!,I thought the original was good and the makers have done a great job of improvement! The vehicles are larger and handle tons better. The gameplay has improved also. A great buy!
3,Smugglers semi fun run .,"I only played it a little bit , So I don't have much to say on it now . I bought mine used , & It did not come with a players manual . That makes the game harder to play when you don't have the directions . One thing that I really like about it is , That its not a Ubisoft game ."
5,Supercalifrajalisticexpealidocius,"This game totally rocks!!!! I HIGHLY reccomend this game for any serious gamers. If you loved the first one, you'll never stop playing the sequal!!!!!!!!"
1,How can anyone review this seriously????,"If you haven't seen this ""movie"" (and that's a generous description for this particular title), ONLY see it if you're into some low-budget laughs. The Alien Factor is the stuff of Mystery Science Theater - and I'm amazed those guys never got hold of this one. Horrendous acting, cheap EVERYTHING and an outrageously (and unintentionally) funny stilt-walking monster. The mere fact this has made it to DVD amazes and mystifies me.Do yourself a favor - order this ONLY if you're wanting to host your own MST3K party."
3,Add Unclear,"I can't tell from the description if this is just one, six foot section. If so, 288 is a little much. How many 6 foot sections are included?It says each section contains 12, 1 by 6 boards. ? I don't see any separate 'boards' in the section. Does this mean you get 12, six foot sections? If so, great deal. If it's just one, 6 foot section, then it's pretty expensive.If someone could re-write the product description, I could make a decision on this product."
3,"Good, but not JOHN DIGWEED Good","This CD isn't as good as any john digweed release. If you want a good CD get Hong Kong, Sydney, or Bedrock. Hong Kong is a masterpiece and towers over Los Angeles. CD1 lags and doesn't pick up till the middle. After a few good songs it dies and finally comes back with 1-800 ming. CD2 starts off harsh then picks up with ""My Release"" and then wanders off untill ""Genesis"".Only buy this CD if you are a fan of Digweed, or an Global Underground collector"
4,tight dark prog,"This is a fine record if you like a darker blend of progressive house.This sound is the future,a late-nite drugged-out flavor tastefuly blended by one of the masters. If you're tired of generic cookie-cutter trance stuff you should check it out.I give it 4 stars simply because 5 should mean it's a real classic, like the original sasha&john renaissance."
4,mxing? NO way,"Hi all you out there who think that Digweed actually stands behind a couple of Technics, mixing 12 inches when he records his cd's. Well, he doesn't. He records them into a computer program, adjusts the pitch of the files and sequences them into a perfect mix. Not only Digweed, but all the topjocks who make mix cd's do it this way (and heck why not?). It's really easy and you don't even have to be a dj tot make it sound beatmatched and perfect leveled. (This all doesnt mean I dislike the Global Undergrounds and others, I love em)"
3,Snore..,"2 hours of ploddingly dull progressive house. Just mindnumbingly boring. I enjoyed the first CD of his GU 14, and I enjoy his mixes with Sasha (Communicate and Northern Exposure are both excellent), but I just couldn't bring myself to listen to this a second time.Excellent, seamless mixing, though, but so what?"
2,Irrelevant title....Loquacious...Rather Anti-American,"Troost is clearly educated and intelligent, even mildly amusing at times. But this book is hardly worth any hype. The title is meaningless and unexplained. His text is far too long-winded. And for a man who bemoans capitalism, materialism and nearly everything American, where did he end up living? Cali! In the end, the hypocrisy was a bit much."
4,Hilarious travel story,"I've been on a Bill Bryson kick and generally adore books about travel, so I was psyched when my friend at work gave me this. I was also sickly enjoying reading about how crappy a beautiful tropical island can be sometimes! With arctic air masses threatening to give us frostbite and keep our cars from starting-- I think I had a bit of schadenfreude as I read about our main character's misadventures. Hey, it might be cold here but there's no sea lice, beer shortage, or sharks. It was a fun and fast past travel story."
5,What a hoot!,"This book was an impulse purchase from a stall at the train station, which usually foreshadows a crappy read not worth the $12.However, this time I hit the jackpot; this book is a complete jewel. It's funny as hell, intermittantly informative, and always entertaining.I hope this author publishes more. He's immensely likeable, and manages to avoid the cheap devices that can be such a bore in travel writing. He chronicles the absurdities of island life without being mean-spirited or overly PC. He creates a compelling main character of the island culture, and doesn't need to fashion self-consciously quirky characters out of his girlfriend and the I-Kiribati to sustain interest.Hilarious book, very well-written."
3,Not so good,I thought the book was boring and didn't even finish it. Something was lacking there to draw the reader along through the story.
2,Don't read this book if you're an optimist,"If you're an optimist, you'll quickly be turned off by the continual negativity and complaining about how miserable this island is, the endless self-deprecating humor about how lazy he considers himself, a procrastinator not accomplishing much of anything, while his wife works.After seeing so many positive reviews, I didn't realize it was going to be such a pessimistic book, but quickly realized that as soon as I started reading. I felt it may eventually turn positive but gave up half-way through when I realized it wasn't going to change.In short, if you're conscious of what you feed your mind and love a fun upbeat adventure, skip this book. If you love supermarket tabloids or modern television shows with their drama, negativity, and sarcasm, then you'll probably like this book.On the positive side, I did like the title, the beautiful cover art, and their courage to escape the norm."
3,"Except For The Writing, It Was A Good Book","The story starts slow, then gets interesting, then falters, then hits it's pace. Not bad, not great."
4,Everyone loves little donuts!,"This product is great! I've found that the donuts pop out of the pan very easily if I hit it against the counter right after they've come out of the oven. My only complaints are that the pan is a bit difficult to fill- it may be easier to use a pastry bag. Also, the bottoms of the donuts are kind of oddly shaped due to the very conical middle bit. But on top, they are absolutely adorable, and with the right recipe, tasty! As with other reviewers, I've found that it is useful to have 2 pans- the donuts are pretty small (perfect as a small treat, or for those watching waistlines)."
2,Doughnuts stick,"When I first got this, it worked great. 5 or 6 uses later, it doesn't matter how well I grease the pan or how carefully I measure the shortning in the recipe, the things stick. Doesn't matter when I try to take them out - still hot, warm, cool - they stick miserably."
3,Wish I had purchased the larger donut pan,"We love the convenience and healthiness of baking our own donuts but my experience with this pan is that it is very difficult to get the batter into the smallish grooves. Because the batter is generally thick and sticks together, I find it challenging to get the proper amount in the groove and frequently over-fill. We have ordered the larger version and are looking forward to experimenting with it."
2,disappointing after 16 Pleasures,"I'm about two-thirds of the way through The Fall of a Sparrow and really I am having to force myself to keep going. The characters do not feel real- the author seems to be trying too hard -doesn't seem like he really had the story in him. Too contrived. And why no discussion of why the mother left her children? It is unbelievable that the girls just shrug their shoulders about it and happily go on. I found the endless identification (it wasn't really description) if what the characters were eating, drinking or picking in the garden boring. So many things seem to have been put in the book just so we'd know how ""cool"" Woody (Hellenga?) is: He plays the blues, is a gourmet cook, is irresistable to women, is hip about the fact that his daughter is having an affair with an older married man, listens to Garrison Keillor, had hot sex with his wife every Sunday morning, the list goes on and on. Spare me."
2,"Irritating, finally","I started out really looking forward to this book, but was sorely disappointed. The main character, Woody, is self-indulgent and sexually immoral, though a kind father. I found all the characters unlikable to a degree. They are privileged and have no idea how privileged they are. I got bored half-way through and skimmed ahead to the end. I also was really tired of descriptions of Italian food, jazz/blues music, academic life, Italy and ancient things. The graphic sex descriptions were a lot more than was necessary too. By the middle I didn't care about anybody."
4,Sex,"Wow. I feel compelled to say in Mr. Helenga's defense--There is everso much more to this book than sex. I couldn't help but notice thatsex seemed to be a stumbling block for many readers. But there is much less sex in this book than there are sumptuous Italian recipes or gorgeous discriptions of blues guitars. And if you argue that there is a difference I think you miss the point. This is a story about a man and his family, each in their own way, coming back to life--in all its untidy complexity. I was very happy that Mr. Helenga didn't scrimp on the honest detail. I look forward to his next book."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"Fall of a Sparrow is an unbelievably bad book. First, the main theme is that serial sex affairs are a crucial response to grief. (This is the experience of the book's two main characters.) Second, the book is just plain badly written. The author often repeats virtually the same narrative in two parts of the book. This is either an example of sloppy editing or what the author thinks to be good writing. In either event, it was an annoying testament to the generally low quality of the writing. My advice: Don't waste your time."
4,"Engrossing, Generous Story Telling, Mostly Good","This is an expansive book, told by multiple voices, traveling across time and place (from small town Illinois, to Iran, to Bologna) with a fulcrum that's equal parts classical literature and the exploration of love and loss.Sound like a lot? Throw in bats, guitars, the blues, Italian terrorism, museum installations, chaos, cooking and a nun or two and you get the idea of the richness and variety of this deftly written book.The story is moving and well-woven. The central character is likable, interesting and a pleasure to watch, even as he stumbles in the wreckage of a life devastated by tragedy.Does the author pull it off? Sort of. The ending falls a bit flat, the voices sometimes waver (and so does the prose), the well-researched details sometimes lack a deeper verisimilitude or empathetic human understanding and the explorations don't always lead anywhere. Still, it's a rich, intelligent, ambitious ride and well worth reading."
5,Great knife great price,"I have had my knife for 8 years, and it is just as sharp as it was the day I bought it. I must admit, I wash it in the dishwasher regularly, which greys the walnut finish. However, I hone it before every use. I love the thin blade. My friends with more expensive knifes always comment on how sharp mine are. Tee hee."
4,Works great for a simple home network.,"I've been using mine for over a year with no problems. The adapters work great in my place, and I have some *old* phone wiring."
1,Please do yourself a favor and skip this movie,"I feel bad not recommending this movie, but it just was not good. The director had great initiative in creating the movie, but this movie is a film student attempt at best. No one can act at all, there are no characters who you fall in love with/hate, they had no personalities whatsoever. It just is a shallow movie attempting to further stereotype a gay ""relasionship"" I feel sorry for the director in revealing how inexperienced he is by making this movie - not only in his filmmaking skills, but also in his own life. There are so many GREAT gay flavored films (LIE, Pillow Book, Happy Together, Lola & Billy the Kid... the list goes on...) Unfortunately, this is not one of them."
1,Drifting Asleep,"Alright - I feel Ratings are Important in order to provide a useful range of opinions - I used to only rate movies that I enjoyed and then I would run across a movie that had a high star rating and buy it thinking it might have some substance (what I failed to realize is only one person had rated the film and it was most likely the Director), that was the case with this film - I'm sorry, but I really had a tough time not drifting asleep while watching it...all the Twilight Zone (trying to be creative) bouncing around in time, the mediocre acting at best and the no budget look of the film just did not inspire me...Sorry!"
3,Takes some work on your part to like it,"This movie has some interesting takes on life, love and relationships. It's pretty isolated to just a few characters in L.A. It's boring enough that my partner and I actually were talking back to the characters in order to keep our interest up. There are parts, however, that really make you feel for the characters. They are way too depressed though and it drags this movie down. All the repeating of scenes is also pretty strange and waste of probably a third of the movie."
1,A waste of my time and money!,"I don't review alot of products here unless I love them or hate them. This one I hate.This camera puts out very blocky images. Take for instance you have a camcorder with a digital zoom. You zoom way in and the image looks blocky and hard to read. Well, thats what youre gonna get with this camera. If you take a 640X480 snapshot, get ready for dissapointment. All images and video is blocky with bad color. I changed every setting there is, and nothing gets better.On the other hand, the Intel Deluxe USB camera is wonderful. Please save your time and spend the extra $... for a camera 1000 times better than this one. It provides near crystal clear images and speed.Ryan"
2,"easy to set up, but the pictures are bad","I got this with my computer and used it for about a year until I got a new camera. This camera was easy to set up, but the picture quality is horrendous. If picture quality isn't a big deal to you, the Intel Easy PC Cam pack will work for you; but if you like having quality images, save your money and invest in a better webcam (like the Intel Pocket PC Cam)."
3,It's okay,"It was okay, but the look just got on my nerves. It took awhile for me to install it on my computer, but then it finally worked. I took it back and got a even better one."
4,great for grownups and older kids,This is a game that is THE New York Times Crosswords. They are challenging and can be difficult for many people.The interface for doing puzzles with this is way better than pen and paper. You can cycle through the clues easily. You use the left and right buttons to go from clue to clue and use the stylus (or onscreen keyboard) to enter the letters into the squares.The character recognition could use a little improvement but it works. I only need to backup and try again 5% of the time or so. It does not detract much from the fun.
5,"It's hard, but that's the fun of it.","I love crossword puzzles, and if they're too easy that's just not fun. These puzzles are challenging, and then they automatically tell you if you went wrong so you can fix it. Works for me!"
5,Great game for crossword enthusiasts!,"If you enjoy crossword puzzles, then this is the game for you. The number of puzzles included is amazing (3 years worth of daily puzzles). Also the handwriting recognition is almost perfect and makes it very easy to fill in the puzzles. Trust me, if you like crosswords then you will love this game!"
5,AWESOME,"This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen. They even brought back lots of the funniest characters from the show. But sadly they forgot about gavin. Now, who agrees with me that they should come out with season one of kids in the hall on dvd???"
2,Disappointing,"The Kids in the Hall, Same Guys, New Dresses is something of a disappointment. It follows the Kids on their North American tour in 2000. It was kind of interesting how they showed some behind the scenes stuff and how things were written. But the problem is that the movie only showed clips from the actual tour.There's new material, or at least newer than the old stuff from the series, but we don't get to see it. It's like a tv clip show. They show them getting dressed and eating dinner and talking about the skits. Then they show maybe 10 seconds of a clip. I kept wating for them to get to the actual show.So don't get this unless....well, unless you like being teased. If you like your comedy shown and then quickly pulled away at the last second, this might be for you. Otherwise it's not."
2,Scraps and other Tidbits,"Writers across the world owe a debt of gratitude to the Glimmertrain sisters for their publication. Glimmertrain is a great-paying market and it's also a devil to get work in.All that said, this book is a collection of scraps and tidbits and it didn't really get anywhere. There are scraps that are good but, as is always the case with the anthologies, the quality varies wildly and the selections are so short they really don't add up to anything. I would not recommend buying this book unless you really want everything Glimmertrain."
4,Hangs close to the subject,"I also teach a Rock History class and use this as an overview. The footage is vintage, although I have much of the same from other sources. It really is a shame that the Little Richard footage everyone uses comes from ""The Girl Can't Help It"" because he must have kicked some ass live and we don't get to see it.You are led through the evolution of early Rock and Roll (not Rock) by the year and the film seems to pick Chuck Berry as the main thread. The footage of Fabian singing near the end is the best I have seen for explaining a Teen Idol, and Pat Boone gets the drubbing he deserves. John Heard is the narrator, which is cool.This is good for what it sets out to do: to reinforce the rhythm and blues origins of this music and the arrogance and malice of the musical powers of the day such as Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan. These guys wouldn't have recognized the blues if they fell in it."
2,cannot get it right,"After two attempts cooking with the Roaster Oven, I must say I need more training. It cooks alot hotter then a conventional oven. Practice before you use it. I only have cooked meats. The first turkey blew up, the second was nicely done altho not as brown. The third was a ham which I over cooked. The oven is only useful for large amounts. It is hard to store. It cleans up nicely. The directions could be better."
3,Workers Comp Victim review,"I found this book very entertaining and enlightening. The primary character is well developed, and his insights regarding co-workers/bosses are on target. Although he gets into some situations that he knows will have possible bad ramifications, he goes ahead anyway, reflecting his own curiosoty about what it is like to be on the other side of the fence, as well as his reactions to those hard -learned lessons. The overall story has several interesting twists that are laughable, yet very realistic, particularly where he applies the tricks of his trade to his own case."
5,I Love this light!,"This light is very sleek and professional looking. I like how it hinges so you can lift it and access the tank a little better. It also have a really nice silver reflector backing the inside. Please don't forget to peal off the protective plastic film that's on the water shield or the light won't penetrate the water like it should and could melt. The best part is I saw this exact light fixture in a 30"" size at PetCo today for $199.99!!!!!! If you're going to get this light please do yourself a favor and buy it here on Amazon. Even with shipping it's a steal! I would also suggest you to buy your bulbs here on amazon also because I am having a hard time finding the right bulbs at the store around me. I bought a 36"" bulb but I guess I got some sizing measurement wrong because its too long. You can buy the bulbs that Amazon suggest you buy or you can go hunting around. Personally I'm going to take the entire light fixture to the store with me to get the right bulbs."
4,GREAT KRAUT PUNK !!,"Less artsy than their weirder,more eclectic debut album,this is an excellent sophomore effort by the diva?s band.More rock`n roll oriented in general and with Nina emphasazing the upper portion of her operatic vocal range this time (shrikier),with voice effects that make her voice cut your tympanae.It opens with an excellent reggae,and from that point the songs are frantic,fast paced punk `n roll affairs,with an incredibly lenghty and heavy solo in the middle of ?Fallin In Love Mit Mier? that has to be heard to be believed.The albums closes at a bare 38?with an instrumental rendition of ?My Way ?so deformed and sped up you would?nt tell it?s based on the original (and maybe it?s not !).One of the songs is a filler taken from some live recording you?ll be skipping after the first 30?but nothing?s wrong considering how good and anthologic this album is.The sound is very good despite a certain lack of upper treble (especially noticeable on the cymbals."
2,Boring recipes,"Having lived in Morocco, I had high hopes for this cookbook, but I was truly let down. I've made 10+ recipes from this book and none have been interesting. I don't know if she was trying to avoid including unusual ingredients or complicated techniques, but there just isn't much flavor in these pages. She does include nice vignettes and stories about the food, so you may enjoy reading this book, and likewise if you don't like your food too strongly flavored and you prefer simple cooking, you might like this, but it's just not even sort of authentic, good middle eastern food. For example, the last recipe I made called for boiling chicken in turmeric and water with a few crushed cardamom pods. Really?? That's what you call a chicken sofrito? My turmeric was from Morocco and even that couldn't save this bland recipe. I'll be looking elsewhere."
3,Meh,"I don't dislike this book. I just don't love it, either.My nieces rarely choose to read it, and I don't choose to read it any more often than they do. It just doesn't grab any of us.Maybe I'm just over the whole ""imitating Dr. Seuss"" thing that many lesser writers try to do. I wish they'd find their own style instead of trying to copy his - they never get it right anyway."
2,"Tastes good, Poor shipping","There's nothing wrong with pringles potato chips, however the packaging from amazon leaves something to be desired. At least half the chips in every can were broken into crumbs on recipt. It's hard to say exactly whose fault this is, rough handling at some point along their journey to my house is the obvious fault."
4,Not for the faint of heart,"This music is definitely not for those people that listen to mainstream music or even, really, for people that like Neo-prog. This music challenges you and demands repeated listening to get the most out of it. I found it to be one of those CD's that it was the on the 5th or 6th listen that the lightbulb went off and I started to ""get it""."
2,Troubleshooting is Tricky,"While initial setup was easy on this product, I ended up returning it because of hard-to-troubleshoot problems between other network devices and other software on my systems.Instructions are limited and the support line isn't 24/7, so don't plan on installing nights or weekends."
5,A windscreen friendly canister stove,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer means. The title says ""MSR Windpro Canister Stove,"" but perhaps I missed some other (erroneous) mention of liquid fuel in the details. At any rate, the other reviewer and the item's title are correct--this is a canister stove as is made clear by the picture. This stove is great because you can use a traditional wind-screen with it since the canister is away from the flame. MSR has achived this while keeping the stove very light...and quite stable. This is a great stove and I have no real complaints. I have 3 MSR stoves and they make quality products which they stand behind if anything goes wrong (which has only happened once to me)--Great customer service!"
4,really hot,this movie is really good for seduction cinema movies laurie wallace is hot if you like lesbo movies this one is good it also stars misty mundae if you get it enjoy!!!!
3,Need to know where you are to know where you are,"This isn't much wider than a car tire, which means you need to line up on it pretty accurately to start with or else it does no good because you'll miss it completely. But if you can train the driver of the particular car to line up on something as they enter the garage, it serves the purpose. It doesn't stick well to the floor (other reviewers say it does but they must live in Arizona and not Minnesota, or maybe the problem was trying to install it when the floor was already wet, icy, and frozen...) I suppose it works better than the 2x4 we had on the floor because that kept moving and had to be readjusted from time to time. But unlike the 2x4, this tends to skid around if the driver turns the front wheels at all when on this. Overall, this was a so-so product, but the cheap price (especially when it was a DOTD) makes it tolerable."
2,Slippery,I Bought this 2 month ago and I keep putting glue to keep it steady...but still...I'm looking for something works better...
3,not as useful as I thought,"The mat is effective at stopping the car at the right spot. Had no problems with the adhesive.My car tends to ride up on the last bump, and I need to shift it into neutral after I stop, to let it settle correctly.I tried the mat for a few days and then removed it because the left and right edges of the mat have ridges which rise up. I think these were meant to trap water and dirt. Unless you park the tire exactly in the middle, the tire will rest on these ridges. The ridges were leaving a slight indentation on my tires every morning, which I did not think was right.I would have been happier if the middle of the mat was as flat as possible, so that it was almost flush with the garage floor."
1,Nicely looking bad scale,"Tanita scales have some kind of a memory feature that records your weight and shows it whenever the measurement comes within +/- 1.5lbs.I.e.:If you weighed 150.6lb on Sunday and gained 0.8lb over 2 days and 10 measurements, the scale would still show 150.6!I think they do this to create a perception of consistency in measurements, but result is incorrect measurement..."
3,On the very small side.,"These are very small. It is of good quality and probably fine for an egg, but for pancakes much too small. I would have returned it, but it was so affordable that it really didn't matter to me."
4,Works well,I had no problems using these for fried eggs in a skillet. Remember that the cooking surface should be flat as rounded bottoms will cause leaking. I also greased the ring it self with a small amount of country crock on my fingers before cooking. The eggs slid out easily. The kids and wife were impressed and my 3 year old squealed with delight.
1,These leak!,"I was so excited to get these in the mail that I immediately tried to make some eggs. The egg just oozed out as soon as I poured it into the heart mold. I'm so sad. I wanted to make cute heart eggs. Sigh. I guess I can just cut the egg after it's cooked, but it's not the same!"
2,A Mess!,"I bought this hoping to make a cute egg breakfast for Valentine's Day and I was greatly disappointed! I tried several times to try to get the egg from just slipping out from under the mold. When I added a bit a a time and that seemed to work, but then the bottom was WAY over done and the top was raw. What a waste of money and eggs! Maybe it could be used for a cookie cutter is the only reason I gave it two stars, but I didn't buy it for a cookie cutter."
5,Great experience,"I only used this a couple times so far, but loved it each time. When I used it properly the pancakes and eggs held their shape. I had minimal sticking (nothing more than to be expected).Plan to use for future Valentine's days as well as for special occasions :)"
2,Cliched,"I wasn't impressed by this book at all. The plot line felt contrived and written according to a formula. You could just tell that the suspects that they were after were not the right ones. There was a slight tension that built up as the story continued but not anything like what I expect from a romantic suspense. And the real capper was the fact that even though the main character was a woman, the narrator was a man who did a lousy job at women's voices."
5,CARLA NEGGERS' WHITE HOT IS TERIFFIC!,"I've been a fan of Carla Neggers' books for years, and WHITE HOT was no exception. Not only did I find myself laughing out loud at some of the quirky characters, but the store was gripping with unexpected twists and turns. WHITE HOT is a great read from a great author!"
5,Colombian salsa,After Joe Arroyo's passing I've become more interested in recovering songs I heard as a little girl. This is much later but a good beginning. I know I will find Joe from way back Fruko y Sus Tesos.
1,what a hopeless movie,Well I made the worst investment so far in buying this movie. It was just plain trash and just hopeless
5,"Mixed Bag But ""Amerita/Sense of Direction"" Is Fantastic!","This album is such a rare treat. No other band really combined progressive rock with the blues in such a manner as on this album. It was a double edge sword for the Climax Blues Band. The blues purists hated ""Amerita/Sense of Direction"" and the proggers felt the same about the disco-laden ""Reaching Out"". The other cuts are very good...just a mix of different styles. ""Shopping Bag People"" is a pleasant blues-riff because of Haycock's slide guitar. ""Right Now"" has a kick-back boogie-woogie feel. However, Haycock's searing guitar work on ""Sense of Direction"" is a mind blower and worth checking out at any cost for those who love great classic rock. Yes, it is that good and puts this album over-the-top ranking this as one of the best albums that Climax Blues Band ever released. Highly collectible!"
3,For Jeffrey Combs collectors,This is a thrown together movie that you should buy only if you need to see a early movie with an early Jeffrey Combs appearance in it...there is some nudity..a plus for some viewers..It has Sybil Danning as her usual tall rowdy self and Robert Quarry(Count Yorga) has a walk on part but not much else...the acting is sum par..i think on purpose sometimes...I did buy this movie on Amazon and i am happy with it cause i got what i expected...
4,"not property of DirecTV, HDMI works","I have one of these. DirecTV sells this to you - you don't rent it. And my HDMI connection works fine. There is an occasional need to reset it after a storm, but that seems to be the way these things work."
2,so laughable its scary!,This is supposed to be a zombie movie but it is so badly dubbed that is is over the top laughable. it does however have some neat set designs and creepy music but the mother/son scene was a bit much. i watched it twice. the second time it was on a new video and you could acually see what was happening. maybe thats one reason this movie gets so many bad reviews because on the old copies you cant see anything. on the new print you can. there are a few creepy scenes like when the zombies trap a maid and so forth but its basically worth watching if you know what your getting yourself into. pure cheese and nothing else.
4,Gut munching,"This was another movie that i was pleasently surprised at. There was alot of blood and guts. Not realistic acting, though."
4,Creepy!!,"The scariest part of this film is not the zombies eating people, it is not the fact that these horrible actors and actresses were given jobs, it is not the eerie, yet soothing, jacuzzi jazz soundtrack. It is the ""child"" played by 27 year-old Peter Bark. He's old, he wears a Marv Albert rug, and he's completely scary without trying to be. He runs like a girl and he wears his pants up to his armpits. Did I mention he has an unnatural love for his mother? Watch this movie, the vision of this ""boy"" will haunt you for the rest of your life."
5,I was very curious about Chloe,I was curious to read about Chloe. And I found I liked this more than I did Caitlin. I thought this book would be the same. But no. Chloe is her own person and she is going through her own battles. She is not perfect as Caitlin can be sometimes. Caitlin is definitely mentioned since that is her sister in law. You won't be mad or disappointed when you read more about Chloe. As she struggles to get through high school. She meets some cool friends along the way and together they start their band. My Name is Chloe is a good read and I enjoyed it.
3,Great game but not on the MAC,It's really too bad - my system meets all the requirements - but the game runs horrible on the mac. Really choppy and what not. The demo for the PC runs flawless though - I don't reccomend this for the mac at all - unless they fix it. - which they say on their site that they wont.
4,This movie stays with you.,"I had no doubt that another film from Pedro Almodovar would be good. And this film didn't disappoint. It's very eery and it's a film that stays with you long after you watch it. There are parts that are a bit strange and for lack of a better description -- somewhat disturbing. But, all of the scenes and storytelling relates to the subject matter. It's a film about revenge, desperation, dependence and ultimately survival. It's not one you want to miss.A side note: It would have been nice to have been able to rent this film rather than buying it outright. $15 bucks is a bit steep for a one-time view."
4,creepily entertaining,"Holy smokers, this movie's plot will blow your mind and leave you feeling plenty uncomfortable. By now, most moviegoers know director Pedro Almodovar is out there. The Skin I Live In takes it waaaaaaay out there. It also goes to show if you give Antonio Banderas a meaty role in his own language that he has a far greater acting range than he seems to have in English-speaking roles.Needless to say this is a clever yet creepily inventive movie that not only flips the psycho-sexual thriller on its edge but walks it around the block a few times and spits it out in a horrifying mix of sexual perversity, very dubious medical ethical choices and a weirdness you're not likely to see anywhere else.Extras on the DVD are a waste. The ""Making Of"" is a just 12 minutes of raw footage where you see cameras and boom mics in scenes. The ""Red Carpet NYC Premiere"" is better as you hear from the actors and director but it is extremely short."
5,Best Movie of 2011,"Watching THE SKIN I LIVE IN makes you appreciate film again. Amazing, shocking, and entertaining movie, with an excellent performance by Antonio Banderas."
4,Cooking With Convection Oven,I found this book to be very helpful in learning how to use my new convection oven. Good recipes and good information. Would recommend to those that have no knowledge of convection oven cooking.
1,' the missing book',i cant review the book as i still have not received it even though you advised it was due to be received by23/12/ 2010 - it was purchased for an xmas present !!
2,Disappointed,Was disappointed with the item. Found the digital controls time consuming to use. After using this would have preferred the manual controls. Also disappointed with the defrost function.
2,Hard to read,I did not like the print. Hard to read when it's in a light turquois and red. Not very practical. Even with my glasses on it was difficult for me to read. I think the convection oven cookbook that came with my oven was more informative than this one. Will keep looking for other cookbooks. This one just wasn't my cup-o-tea.
3,Cooking with Convection,This recipe book is okay but it does not give you enough information on what type of pans to use for convection cooking. The book is old and I am sure there must be an updated version that I will look for in the future.
4,"Sleek design, Perfect size, Decently Made","I bought this item for my son who has a rather large portable stereo. He has a small apartment and needed something to put the stereo on that wasn't big and bulky - taking up too much of his precious space. Once we received this we bought a couple of cans of semi gloss black paint to fix the cheesy silver legs. Once the paint dried it looked perfect. It is sturdy and well built and the storage space underneath the shelf for CDs was an added bonus. Most items llike this are cheaply made, however this is not the case for this item."
2,Completely inessential,"Tribute albums are pretty dodgey ventures normally, but covering the Shaggs? Why? I can only assume it's to get your name listed along with other cool folks. The Shaggs are an original and interesting for their music+performance+naivette. Having Pros ""interpret"" their work is just silly and the results speak for themselves. Not one track adds anything useful to ""The Shaggs, Band and Legend."""
1,Good Luck Installing,"The cordless keyboard, mouse, and optional gamepads are a great idea, but that's where Intel left it. The installation software is plagued by errors which caused me to manually install many of the drivers. When you connect the device for the first time, if you can (it took several times and several hours to do this), you are rewarded with more software install errors. Once you figure it all out, it works fairly well except for two things. The mouse eats batteries and the gamepads and mouse can have a lag time. If you do decide to buy this product, good luck."
2,Russian War,"A violent and realistic look at the war between Russia and Afghanistan, ESCAPE FROM AFGHANISTAN concerns a Russian photojournalist and a doctor who are caught up in battle when a skirmish flares up while they are interviewing prisoners near the country's border. As the madness escalates, the doctor tends to the wounded and the photojournalist captures unforgettable images with his camera. All the while, they must struggle to figure out who they can trust as they try to get out of the country. The film is a 1994 Russian production."
2,WIndows Media report as Unknown Album and No Track Titles,"When you play this cd in Windows media, there is no track information and no titles on the tracks. The album title shows as ""Unknown Album"" and Windows media cannot download album information from internet. This appears to be a home made or counterfeit item as all CDs now come with album, artist and track information. iTunes player does not show album or tack information either. I emailed BMG studios that produces this CD just in case fakes are being sold on Amazon."
2,you get what you pay for,"One board on each stand split when we assembled these. We didn't even screw them in too far, which is what would normally cause such splitting. But it doesn't seem to be preventing them from working fine."
2,"great idea, horrible execution",I bought these as my first stands to help me make a better home theater. All the dimensions where good and the price was good. I did read that the construction was bad and the stands were prone too splitting. I thought i could counter that by drill slightly bigger holes and adding a wood glue to compensate. I was careful and tried my best but of the sixteen screws between the two stands i still split 4 times. They are holding together but i am still very disappointed.
4,Just fine,"I'm always amazed how simply knock down furniture is made, but how sturdy it seems to be fore the use. These look sharp and will serve nicely for the speakers in our room."
2,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for. When you pay less than $40 for speaker stands you aren't going to get things like good materials or even reliable product descriptions.These things are made of something. Certainly not wood.It is *very* easy to split the material when you are putting it together if you are not careful.They are not 16"" tall. As another reviewer also noted. They are at least an inch shorter than that. Keep that in mind as well.The ""wire management"" is a joke. There is a hole in the bottom of the base but then there is no groove to route the wire once it gets out so the base ends up on top of it. Very poor design.So it loses a star for the material, the lie on the height and the wire management issue.It gets a star for holding up the speakers and another for being cheap and easy to put together.Any way you slice it. Two Stars.I got these to hold up my mids in a 7.1 system. For that they are fine."
4,"I was there, and the show was 5 star and then some","I can only review the show, so that's why the lack of extra star. If the spirit of that night was even partially caught on this CD, its a BIG 5. I had been in a near-fatal car crash only months before, and was really not supposed to be up and around in that fashion, but I was so glad that I used the tickets (I bought them a week before the wreck). This show was really MAGIC, and had a lot to do with my recovery. When I told my friends in the Caribbean about the whole experience, they simply said, ""Yeah...that's Monty. Man, he's like a shaman, you know..."" Yep. Now I know."
2,"Oregon's ""Prime"" is sadly mistitled","I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, ""Oh, THIS won't be jazz."" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found ""Prime"" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the ""smooth jazz"" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts."
2,Receiver sold separately!,"I STILL can't find the fine print that says ""Base Station Not Included!"" This just went from a good deal to not-worth-the-money. I hope it works like magic...."
5,A Gift Of Many Colours,"This in an exceptionally useful tool for the pre-school child. Our youngest daughter was the beneficiary of its thoughtful design and graded challenges in numeracy and literacy, during the recent Christmas vacation, and simply, couldn't get enough of it. Of course, the reward system of the stars added a wee carrot for her exploits. And it was a useful, if not necessary thing, to sit right through each session with her, to ensure she wasn't skipping or getting lax with her level of accomplishment. This was not an oderous task for either my wife or me. I highly recommend the book, as a lead in to fully-fledged primary school, and am in fact, currently searching for its successor."
3,Not too bad,"This album consists of 6 ambient tracks ranging from 3min. to more than 20min each, for die hard fans only."
2,Moody Filler,"This album was a disappointment. It is little more than moody filler, and hardly even qualifies for background music.Coil only spent two days recording this record, which explains the utter lack of quality therein.This album is not on the same level as Black Light District."
5,Nice with matching shelves,"This is a very nice base that works with the matching shelves . I own 2 bases in black, and one in silver. I have added up to 4 shelves on each base, all full of components, without problems.The only bad thing I can say is that cat hair and dust tends to get trapped in the middle of the base on the floor. But it's not visible unless you go look."
5,How odd . . .,"Why in the world is this product being sold by the Las Vegas Rescue Mission? I can understand them selling books and other used items, in fact I've purchased secondhand books from a non-profit via Amazon before. But nutritional supplements?!? (I'm giving five stars because a rating is required and I don't want to dilute the other reviewer's rating.)"
1,this book wasnt written by the Terminator... was it?,"this book tries as hard as it can to be a mix of every Sylvester Stallone movie ever made, and it doesnt even accomplish that. it seems as if sex and violence were thrown into a book as a tool to keep some people turning the pages. the characters have no dynamics to them, the plot is one that you could get for 99 cents at a local video rental store by grabbing a movie from the Action-Adventure section (which i would advise you to do, it'll save you some time). Do yourself a favor and read Tortilla Flat (john steinbeck) or The Dharma Bums (jack kerouac) instead."
1,LAME,"Mike McGonigal must have hit his head on the bathroom sink. This band is lame. They have about as much in common with Judas Priest as Wham. If you are looking for a band that kinda sounds like Queens of the Stone Age without any of the innovative lyrics or originality, then buy this CD."
1,No show,"To this day 10/14/11 I have not received this product. It would be nice to receive it. If anybody reads this, please look into it for me? thanks."
5,"So far, so good!","I've washed these several times now, and they haven't frayed yet. I am also happy with how thick this line is!"
4,Pretty good,"Robert Forsythe does not participate in the mystery in this one. Instead, his secretary - Abigail ""Sandy"" Sanderson - takes center stage. She agrees to particpate in a murder mystery weekend, where one of the participants is a famous chef whom nobody likes due to his boorish, arrogant behavior. He turns up dead, and it's not part of the game. Sandy solves the mystery as deftly as Robert would have done.I gave it four stars instead of five because the story wasn't as compelling as the previous books."
3,"Not bad, but shows its age...","My copy appeared to be dubbed (I prefer subtitles) --- or at least poorly acted if not dubbed!!! (French?) For its day, I'm sure this was high quality and daring. The young woman is very good looking --- a distinct plus. The film is semi-hard core which is fine. The S/M is obviously acted but probably ahead of its time. These days, if you want to see real S/M, the internet will give immediate satisfaction or harder core, real movies can be ordered.Still, not bad if you find the lead woman attractive as I did. The lead man is not as good looking and has a smaller role.Your call."
3,the image,very good enjoyed the dvd what I wanted I enjoyed the nudity and bdsm and lifestyle along with the location
4,A source of inspiration,I and my special play friends who injoy this lifestyle films and books on this subject. We are always looking for ideas.
3,AWKWARD STORY....GORGEOUS ACTRESS,"I AM NEW TO THE FOREIGN FILM SCENE- SO MAYBE I DONT "" GET IT "" AND IM NOT ASHAMDED TO ADMIT IT. BUT THIS FILM WAS CLUMSY TO ME AND PUT ME OFF A BIT. IT HAS A VIOLENT MOMENT OR TWO THAT I WAS UNPREPARED FOR. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE- THE ACTRESS ON THE COVER OF THIS DVD THAT IS IN THE FILM- PICTURES CANT CAPTURE HOW REALLY BEAUTIFUL SHE IS. I WAS SOOOO BLOWN AWAY AT HOW "" PERFECT "" SHE IS. THIS IS WORTH OWNING JUST TO SEE HER FOR YOURSELF. SHE HAS THAT "" YOUNG/PURE/I DONT NEED MAKEUP QUALITY ABOUT HER. IF I KNEW OF ANOTHER SHOW SHE WAS IN- I'D BUY IT FOR THAT REASON ALONE. IN MY OPINION- CERTAIN BEAUTIES COME ALONG EVERY EVER SO OFTEN. FARRAH FAWCETT AND JENNIFER ANNISTON COME TO MIND. THIS ACTRESS. ALTHOUGH NOT THE GLAMOROUS SIDE OF IT- BELONGS IN THEIR CLASS....TRUST ME."
3,Fun bathroom reading,"We received this as a gift and found that the perfect spot for it was in the bathroom. We enjoy opening it at random and reading the interesting, funny or just plain unbelievable bits of trivia that it contains. This lighthearted collection of facts isn't designed to do anything more than amuse its readers, and if you expect that from the beginning you should enjoy it immensely.While this little volume is entertaining, it also isn't something I'd recommend spending any significant amount of money on for yourself. Buy it new as a gift for the colleague whose baby shower you were invited to - it's much more clever and original than yet another pack of onesies or layette set - or pick it up used for yourself and enjoy."
2,okay,"It was okay but its only finished on one side. Its great for a necklace, not so good as a charm."
5,Tom Shover is a Deity,"MSU is better than...Steve Kowalski...the person, not the band...and maybe somewhat reminiscent of ""The Flys."" I am ecstatic that Tom hasn't sold out, and his lyrics rival ""Rocking horse rocks while the wallpaper peels, curtain would like to know what he has done."""
2,Awkward for small hands,"I tried this trackball for a few days and, while it might have been acceptable for general use, I found it unusable for graphics work. I have small hands which may be why I frequently hit the left click button at the wrong angle so that it wouldn't register. Dragging with this device felt very uncomfortable, and it wasn't as precise as my ancient Logitech FX. I would have purchased another Logitech, but they seem to have discontinued all models with a large enough ball for precision graphics work. Despite my small hand size, I finally decided on the even bulkier Kensington Expert Mouse Optical as the most comfortable replacement for my graphics work."
2,Tough on the Wrist,This mouse is a bit tough on your wrist. As I read in another article that it was tough for small hands. I'm a pretty big guy thus have some big hands and its still tough on my wrist. I find that it seems to angle a little to bit upward causing some stress on my wrist. Enough stress that I'm using my other arm to browse the web while I look for a new mouse. The mouse works great and has a great deal of buttons for many uses but the angle is just to hard on me.
5,Best Trackball,I have owned more than 15 different trackballs and this one is the best by far.Nuff said.
2,Great while it lasts,"I have purchased several (10) of these trackballs for myself and friends. I love it -- while it works. Of the five that I have used on desktops at the office and home as well as with laptops, all have failed. In each and every case it is the wire connection to the trackball body. The wires stop making contact and the trackball stops working. You can wiggle the wires for a few days and it will work for awhile. Eventually they all stop working at all. I have kept the balls from the broken trackballs in case I want to play giant marbles.If Mr. gates would make the cable a bit sturdier I would buy another."
2,"Buttons about 1"" too far back - you must bend your thumb!","Microsoft should really take a lesson from Logitech here. I tried the Trackball Explorer as a replacement for my WELL worn Logitech Marble-Man FX (discontinued - though I'll never understand why.) My hands are M/L - totally typical.After 1 hour of use, my thumb was killing me. You see, you must reach BACK to far to hit the thumb button. If you compare it to logitech, you'll see that they have the buttons in-line with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally, meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at all.The mouse is accurate, and the ball feels nice, but you have to use those buttons... and they are awful. If they'd move them forward about 1"" this would work as well as the Logitech MarbleMan FX does.It's no wonder those things are going for $150 USED on Ebay... Logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated it."
1,It's a good thing I got my money back!,"I have been using trackballs ever since I got my first computer. This one ranks dead last. You would think the new technology would be great, but it's a drawback. I could only stand to use this trackball for 3 hours due to the fact that my onscreen mouse movement was very jerky. I need precise and smooth movement to do my job and can get it with a Logitech. I sold this mouse on eBay for a profit."
3,did not meet expectation,"positives:looks cool, buttons are customizeable, easy to cleannegatives:Not as precise as I wanted to be. I used to have the logitech trackman fx which broke recently so I decided to get this one. The dots on the logitech trackball are more finer than this one and makes the percision better. If you slowly move the trackball horizontally/vertically, you can see that the cursor jitters. this is NOT a plus if you want to use image-editing programs. also BAD if you need to play a game that requires precise aiming like counter-strike.also, the upper button located left of the trackball is too close to the wheel. actually, both thumb buttons feel akward except the scroll wheel.since i don't turn off my computer, the red light can be annoying when trying to sleep.conclusion:I would recommend the logitech trackman fx over this one. I can't comment on the cordless trackman fx since i don't have one."
4,An interesting book for all who work with children,I found this book to be very informative with a great in depth look at research which has been encountered throughout the book. There is lots of valuable information which is useful to both professionals and the families they are working with. The focus of the book takes you through some case studies giving the reader a greater understanding of the theoretical concepts for a given subject. The book does deal with young children up to the age of 8 years old but as the author explains the theories can be explored further with all age groups. A very good read which holds some very interesting appendicies at the end of the book.
3,what happened to the sound?,"this import is allegedly remastered. in fact, the liner notes state that the original record was released with dolby when it shouldn't have been and that was corrected. three tracks were released in 1992 without the dolby on the box ""between thought and expression"" and sound wonderful. this 2000 released renders the tracks as if they were recorded in a cardboard box - no dynamics whatsoever. perhaps they didn't fix the dolby after all. i'm disappointed."
5,Little Giant Galvanized Controlled Stock Waterer,Very Happy with the purchase of these. Easy to mount and a great product. I would recommend this product to others.
3,The Native Way to healing,"This item was a gift purchase for those who like the healing of Indian Medicine and beliefs. The cover was very detail, book covered various native teaching, healings and word details."
1,cheap,I bought 2 of these for my daughter and both broke within a few months. I am veyr disappointed since it is Timex but I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Wait for a reputable publisher,"I agree with all the other reviewers so far - this book was not worth buying. I am very dissappointed as we are using Struts and I jumped at the chance to get a book on the subject. I should not have been so trigger happy with the cash, I can't believe I pre-ordered this book. It was almost a total waste of money. I did find it interesting to read some of the author's perspective on developing software, but I was really looking more for a good book about Struts, and this was not at all that."
5,Great mouse,This is by far the best mouse I've ever used. I have one at work and one at home. It glides smoothly on just about any surface but if you want the best control and feel use a mouse pad. The only caveat is you can't use it on a mirror or clear glass surface. That's not a problem for me and I'll never go back to the old ball mouse.
1,not realy perfume !!!,the first time something like this happened to me. This is not what I ordered. I know very well Lacoste Pour Femme fragrance. is any water and alcohol! additional problem that I can not give up. I would like to get what I paid for it or the original perfume or your money back.jerzy
4,A must-have for Jimi enthusiasts and others alike,"This is definitely my favorite in comparison with First Rays of the New Rising Sun. The album contains five unreleased recordings, four instrumentals (these are always my favorite), and covers of Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower and Drifter's Escape. Power of Soul and Message to the Universe [message to love] are better on the live album Band of Gypsies. After buying the three Experience albums, this would be my first purchase. There are 65+ minutes of music and it is all fresh Hendrix."
5,a great album,"This is one of the best Hendrix releases since Janie took over. Buy it. The sound is the original, no one has stuffed around with the mix like Alan Douglas used to do. They should have included ""The star spangled banner"" from Rainbow Bridge though. A definite must especially for new Hendrix fans who dont have all the albums these songs came from. I dont think this version of ""Little Wing"" would have been approved by Jimi though (it is one of the weakest Hendrix songs ever officially released/it sounds like Angel anyway)."
2,New To Hendrix? Don't Start Here.,"One million stars for Pali Gap (on CD finally!), and this is a really cool version of Power of Soul, but ""scraping the barrel"" comes to mind. Granted, it's Jimi's barrel, but I wonder what he would think of this release."
2,"Bring Back Crash Landing,War Heroes etc.........",Reissue the classic posthumous Hendrix to set the record straight .All of this South Saturn Delta stuff causes more confusion to an already confusing catalog .Alan Douglas was not perfect but he kept things very simple and enjoyable .
2,Splintered sincerity,"2 1/2Considering the fact that solo enthusiasts could probably listen to this man's bathroom ruminations with baited breath makes many of these throwaways severely good trash, even on one of his more cheaply exploited compilations devoid of fresh content."
2,a dissapointment except pali gap,"the title track is ambitious but falls short.. a lot of the other tracks are already available elsewhere or i heard a lot in the live releases already, like tax free, message to love, Angel,lover man(rock me baby), power of soul.all along the watchtower isnt much different to the recorded version. little wing is just Angel again.the only one i thought was fun was pali gap.can you rent cds? just hear it twice and return it but copy pali gap :)."
1,TURNING IN HIS GRAVE,"THERE IS PROBABLY A GOOD REASON THIS MATERIAL IS OUTTAKES. THIS ALBUM IS COMPLETELY UNLISTENABLE. JIMI PRIDED HIMSELF ON THE COMPOSITION OF HIS ALBUMS, WHICH MAKES THIS MONEY GRABBING NONSENSICAL ALBUM EVEN MORE OF A TRAGEDY. I THOUGHT THAT AS A GOOD HENDRIX FAN I SHOULD OWN AS MUCH JIMI AS I COULD GET MY HANDS ON. RIDICULOUS. IM SURE SOME WILL CLAIM THAT ONLY HARD CORE MUSIC FANS WILL ""GET"" THIS ALBUM. DONT BUY IT. INVEST IN A SECOND COPY OF HIS BLUES ALBUM OR BAND OF GYPSIES AND TAKE IT TO THE HOUSE."
3,A Mixed Bag Of Rarities,"It's no shock that the two great cuts here, the wild blues ""Look Over Yonder"" and the made-on-the-spot instrumental ""Pali Gap"" were initially released in 1971 with much more stellar company. Except for the annoying ""Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice"" and the meandering ""Tax Free"", each of the remaining cuts is worth a listen. The jazziness of the title track reveal where his leanings may have led him given a few more years. The same but different ""Watchtower"" fascinates as does the other Dylan cover. And though there are disruptions of a smooth flow, the home demos are evidence enough that this guy breathed and felt music like few others."
3,Runs Small!!!!!!,This T-shirt is soooo cute but runs very small. It is advertised as a women's t-shirt - should be advertised as a baby T. I wear a size 12 - a large is usually plenty big. This shirt was skin tight. I don't think an extra large would have been big enough. Very disappointed because I loved the shirt. It has been returned.
1,Abominable poetry,I must say that this poetry book is an abomination. The standard of poetry is so poor that it makes very frustrating reading. Some of the poems fail to make any sense because Kim's grasp of English is very weak. Kim gives an inaccurate impression of Korea and Koreans; in fact a better title for Kim's poetry collection would be 'an American tourists view on Korean society'. This poetry collection can be summed up as a load of rubbish.
5,Perfect gift for people who like to entertain.,Gave this penguin to people who have many parties and like to entertain. It was most enthusiastically received. They told me that the penguin sits proudly on their black granite counter top and it is both utilitarian and decorative.
2,"Okay, but better Naruto fare exists . . .","This movie was very reminiscent of the very first ten to fifteen episodes of the Naruto series. Problem is, this movie takes place nowhere near that timeline. As such, this feels so rehashed and, while it embodies the 'my determination will see me through any situation', the plot just doesn't pull it off. Honestly this feels like the characters are back-sliding in development as compared to the series. Of all the characters Gaara seemed to be the only one that had continued to develop in the movie. I probably could have added a star for the wonderful animation, but with the higher budget movies have you kind of expect it."
1,worst naruto movie,this is the start of the bad running naruto movie's. by far the worst. after this they get a bit better
5,This Movie is Gaara-eat!,"Naruto The Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of GelelThe second of the Naruto movies finds our hero teaming up with some of the sand Shinobi to fight some enemies that have never been encountered before. How will they fare? Well considering I just reviewed the third movie and Naruto was in that one, probably fairly well. ;)As usual, top-notch quality."
4,Thin but adequate,"We have a toy poodle and purchase these for him.The product is thinner than others, but is adequate for puppies and small dogs.No reason to pay more.We have purchased this item from different suppliers the last 3 times, depending on total cost(price plus ship).RECOMMEND."
3,Product is really thin....,I ordered this product because my dog has had operations on her bladder and kidneys and right now she does not know when she has to go thus retraining. I lay these in my bathroom where she was trained to go when a puppy. They are truly thin but they do this job for me. For the price I would say the pads are worth it.
2,Marble Cleaner,"The product does not do a good job of removing water spots, and that's primarily what i need it for."
5,IT IS A GIFT OF LOVE,"A FRIEND TAPED THIS OFF TV FOR ME AND IT IS WEARING OUT,AND I DISCOVERED IT ON HERE,IT IS A VERY WARM FAMILY MOVIE AND IT IS GOOD TO SEE DEBBIE REYNOLDS AGAIN,AFTER SO MANY YEARS, I ALSO HAVE A GRANDSON NAMED DANIEL WHO IS A FOOT BALL PLAYER SO IT MAKES ME EXTRA SENTIMENTAL.GOOD FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT BASED ON A REAL FAMILY.IT MADE ME HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE IT,AND MAY SEND A COPY OF IT TO MY GRANDSON DANIEL."
5,Waffle Maker excellence.,"We find that this waffle maker delivers all that is promised. It is an excellent Belgian Waffle maker, the best we have ever own."
5,I love it!!,My boyfriend wanted a waffle iron for Christmas. I purchased this one and we both love it. The kids love it too!!
3,Misleading Add,"Wow, this is a great waffle maker. But, they advertise belgian waffle maker. My experience is everything waffle but that. I think of a belgian waffle as thick and round. This did not make a thick waffle. I had to return it. I am looking for a round thick waffle. Sorry!"
2,buy with caution,"To begin with, this waffle maker makes great waffles. The settings are accurate and it makes a variety of products, crispy or soft. Batter does not stick to it: it looks good, easy to clean. BUT here is the reason for the pitiful 2 star review: We happily used this for about 10 Sunday mornings, special breakfast, and on the 11th or so a piece of the hard plastic housing broke off making the waffle maker difficult to use. It still does work. Some plastic is just too brittle and this appears to be that kind. I do not think we were unduly rough handling it. It broke when I picked it up by the handle on the lid. So if you like this one do be very gentle with it."
4,mr,the waffle maker is fine but it did not have any instructions or receipes.other than that it is great.thanks Bob
2,"I Love You, Judi, But...","Dame Judi Dench is a superbly talented actress and a lovely human being, and she earned every bit of the acclaim sent her way. But in this book, her biographer asked a bunch of associates to write about her, and an endless series of essays oozing with praise gets old fast. I wouldn't even read it if it was DARLING MICHAEL LaROCCA. Sorry."
3,in what way is this special..pl clarify,"actaully i have bought peachpit & i really like their books specially VQS guide series . REG this , how this book deals with PROJECTS/TUTORIALS without any demo CD or demo FILES ? in what way this book differs from the FCP MANUAL cam someone pl clarify..LISA you are requested to clarify thanksbestwishes"
3,Doesn't quite live up to its promise.,"First off, I do like the features. Using the extra two buttons to go back and forth between web pages is a great timesaver. Having used trackballs in the past, the action in this one is a letdown. While there are mini-rollers to help the ball move, the bulk of the weight rests against plastic nubs which cause the ball to stick frequently. Also, the inertia to overcome in getting it to start rolling makes fine movements a chore. Sometimes my thumb can slide over the ball and it won't move, it may be too slippery. Will probably look to replace with a freer moving mechanical trackball."
1,If you like tendonitis...,"Who came up with the bright idea that a thumb operated trackball was ergonomic? Ten minutes after installing this thing, there were shooting pains up my forearm. I unplugged it and went back to a logitech trackball which is not great but doesn't require medical attention subsequent to use.A pity, 'cause their intellimouse explorer mouse is by far the best mouse around."
3,Very Nice but gums up.,This mouse has all the features you could want and is very comfortable to use if your right handed. The biggest problem I found with it though was that the ball falls out and the bearings that the ball rolls on alwasy seem to get gummed up.
2,Action of the ball sticks on slower movements,"The trackball perfectly fits in my hand, but I found that the ball did not track properly when trying to move the pointer slowly. I recommend the Logitech Trackman Wheel instead of this product."
1,Useless trackball,"This trackball is virtually useless. The ball's friction is so bad that it is impossible to control the cursor accurately and smoothly. Also, the software that came with the device did not enable the advertized features (using Windows XP). So, although the concept is good (the extra 2 buttons, for forward and back, are a great idea), the implementation is so bad that it defeats the utility. The Logitech trackball is orders of magnitude better."
1,Trackball doesn't track!,"I used the MS trackball optical for about a month. I just put it back in the box. My thumb hurts because the curser/pointer is moved only by your thumb. Even worse---the ball moves the pointer very sporatically. Sometimes, I'll roll the ball up or down and nothing happens. Save your money and buy a logitech ""Marble Mouse"" (I use it on my other computer). It cost about the same, doesn't hurt you hand, and actually moves the pointer where you want it to!"
1,Just not smooth.,"Count me along with those that don't like this trackball. I made the switch from the conventional mouse when I started to notice my wrist aching. The thumb control seemed like a good idea.I like the ergonomics of this trackball. The buttons are well placed and the scroll wheel works great. But this device fails miserably in the most important area - the trackball itself. Quite simply, it is not smooth. The motion is jerky, making it difficult to get teh cursor on words when editing type. I do a lot of word processing and cut and paste throughout the day. This is a nightmare with this unit.Gunk quickly gets caught up inside the ball cradle, which must be cleaned daily. And I thought the opticals would be maintenance free. I am always taking out the ball and wiping it down to try to make it spin smoother. It works for a bit and then I am back to the jerky motion.My best advice, which I will follow from now on, it try it before you buy. Not recommended."
1,TERRIBLE! Do not buy it! Don't listen to others!,"What a piece of garbage. The ball sticks and binds and there are no solutions. I have tried various lubricants and filing down the plastic bumps that hold the ball in and other things...nothing works. Daily or hourly cleaning makes it manageable, but that is ridiculous, I cleaned my other mice monthly. This thing is just poorly designed. If you need any level of precision whatsoever, like being able to highlight a word or a paragraph or an entire page of text, this thing is too clumsy to get the job done. Screwed again by Microsoft. I should have known."
2,Not as good as Logitech's Trackman products,"I have a LOGITECH Trackman mouse. It works really well. The optical ball on the Logitech is very fluid. I purchased this Microsoft Trackball mouse due to the fact that it was on sale at Circuit City. The Microsoft Mouse is not any where near as fluid and comfortable as the Logitech. The action on the optical ball is annoying and is not as responsive and natural as the Logitech. Bottom line - if you are considering this, buy the Logitech instead. You will be much more happy! Peace."
1,Not what it looks like,"I did not buy this item, but I can tell you that the picture that accompanies these sanding belts and their specs are two different things. The picture seems to be something about 3 inches wide and about 20 inches around. The spec says 2 inches wide and 48 inches around. Not even close! Caveat emptor, the picture is probably wrong!"
5,It Gets Better After a Period of Reflection,"I finished this book and was initially unimpressed. However, as does all great writing, certain passages and scenes have stuck with me for several weeks, causing me to go back and review certain scenes. As time passes, I begin to see the truly outstanding nature of this book. It is one that requires maturation in your mind before you can appreciate what Matthiesen has done. The characters are richly drawn with very little description. They slowly reveal their multi-faceted natures through conversation alone. I am still pondering some of the author's symbolism and will be for some time to come."
3,Does its job effectively.,"Attractive block with a Henckels' logo to inspire brand loyalty ;-). Looks good and does its job well. Holds a honing steel, kitchen shears, two large bladed knives, four medium bladed knives, and two small bladed knives. Some items may stick out the back, but the open-backed design grants the luxury of not having to worry about blade length (this may be common in knife blocks, but this is my first one)."
3,It does it's job,"For some how I don't see it in color, must be something I miss. The camera is color. It does it's job recording according to my schedule. I upgraded my system to Windows 7 32 bit and used the Windows Vista 32 bit driver that was posted on Lorex's website for the device, it works. At first I tried it with Windows 7 64bit version, it did not work. I down graded to Windows 7 32bit and used the Vista driver for Lorex QLR0440 that was posted on Lorex's web."
5,inkling of a very good book,"I was required to read this book in Dr. Williams Class, yes the Dr. Williams. He is a very intelligent and creative man, and his writtings reflect that. If you are unable to take a class with him, his books reveal his character.He has a passion for books, especially classics and that is revealed in this book. The long lost conversation of reading. How older books, more learned authors of yester-year has to say to us today. In a society of seven steps to this and ten steps to that, Dr. Williams stops and smells the roses, if you will. If you are willing to read this books to, he may instil that same love of reading the classics.Take the time to read something different. Partake in the conversation of reading."
3,Good game but seems to be lacking features,"I loved this game. It did very well for a RTS on a console. One thing it needed was a skirmish or a multiplayer mode. Since it lacks these options, it's replay value ends after you beat the campaign. The campaign missions were quite challenging on hard. A good game, but you should probolly rent it before you buy it."
3,Should have been a shooter version,I haven't played this game yet but it should have been made has a shooter version like AvP and Avp2 for pc. If fox interactive decides to make Avp3 they should be a shooter version and for both pc and Playstion 2.
4,AvP: Extinction,"This game is very flawed, but is tons of fun if you can be patient with the AI. There are plenty of different types of soldiers, and the three races are very diverse. 21 Missions total will probably be around a week, unless you play all day. Later missions usually take about an hour. Buy it at a local store, like GameStop or EB, beat it within the 7 days, return it. Voila!"
4,blast from the past,"I purchased this on Kindle. Read this book many years ago, in the seventies , to be exact, when it was released for the first time. Very entertaining and fun to read. If you have never read anything by Judith Krantz, start doing that now.I plan on re reading all of her books."
2,Words can't describe......,"I have 2 copies of the complete series. One better than the other. Heard about the dvd, went crazy. When it came out, my friend was one of the first to recieve his. He let me borrow it. The added sounds are a little bothersome, but N-O-T-H-I-N-G compairs to what they did with the cells.**This item is one of my favoritesIn Heavy Metal War, all the auto bots arrive to view the ""boss monkey"" get his sparkplug shoved sideways by Megatron.WHAAATS THIIIS??!!! Everone is transforming from auto to mech mode, but for some reason Ironhide is changing from robot mode to auto. A split second later, he's jawing with the rest of the guys.***The color shading errors in the O-R-I-G-I-N-A-L B-R-O-A-D-C-A-S-T has coloring errors....but not this cleaned-up. Hell, they added a few.*****************************************************************THERE WAS NO NEED TO RELEASE THEM, IF YOU WERE NOT FINISHED!!!!"
5,Old school Tranformers,"I would set my alarm clock every Saturday morning and get extremely upset if the bus was running late on weekdays and made me late for this show. Excellent series, I can let my kids watch it with no worries at all of anything inappropriate."
3,Disappointing season 1 from Rhino - valuable 4th extras DVD!,"THE SERIES RULES!!! Don't get me wrong, but Rhino's release here is full of errors and bugs. Reversed scenes, stereo-track sometimes with extra-effects sometimes not, the Dolby 5.1 track allways contains extra-effects. This is ok, but for nostalgic people like me this is bad. They edited out ""originalnes"" from the series. A pity.The idea behind the picture remastering was good but leaded to faults.The 4th extra DVD - exclusively in this boxset - with lots of extras on it is worth the purchase anyway. So for a fan like me I just bought it because of the extras.If you have a PAL DVD player, think of buying the UK boxset, with unedited picture material and completly different extras on the fourth DVD!!"
5,Nostalgia with one of my favorite cartoons of all time,"I never got into GI Joe as a kid. It was always the Transformers. So of course I had to buy this set.I don't know if other people liked it, but one of my favorite things about this release is that they did not correct some of the errors in the original production. For example, I know the color discrepancies have been mentioned and complained about. I actually like that Rhino did not fix them. I know that what I'm seeing is the same show that I saw as a little kid. It also lets me appreciate how far animation production has come in the last 25 years.I'm not going to get into the series, because most people who are looking to buy this set are already Transformers fans and know pretty much what they're getting into. Just be aware that you're getting a cartoon that was produced in the early 1980s."
3,great series - terrible remastering,"I love Transformers G1 and I was looking forward to the DVD release but this is a disaster! Reverse transformation scenes sometimes and smoke- and fireeffects missing. The soundeffects are also very strange, not entirely what fans expected..."
5,Great produst sold by an even better supplier,The slides are ever bit as good as any out there. What makes them even better is the service of the supplier. They went out of their way to ship and service me as a customer. I will use again.
2,Poor Sinjun is wasted here...,"I cannot believe this is the same girl from The Sherbrooke/Hellion Bride books. And why on earth does CC insist on tragedy after abuse after disaster for her heroines, I think I read three CC books in a row where the heroine miscarries/is abducted/is abused. And Colin? I don't think so. He leaves her alone with that witch and although he knows she is a virgin, he sure doesn't care, does he? Sinjun, my darling, you deserved better."
5,"'Best Of The West Coast Soul""-Salsoul Connection Ol' Skool Rarities!","Some of the West Coast Soul was overlooked and underrated. This joint offers some of the best and the rare, though some or most of, these artists never got the attention they deserved. Take The San Francisco TKOs, whose version of Smokey Robinson's ""Ooh Baby Baby"" gets your attention. By the way, the vocalist on this track is deep baritone (yes, a female can do it too!) Penny Lewis. People mistook her voice for a male lead and thought the song was ""screwy"". Try to listen again, please. Other of their hits include ""Make Up Your Mind"". A true treasure from Kent Records (original label) which was a small company foreshadowed by the likes of RCA and Capitol Records (a damn shame). You miss a lot when you are in the time-warp of manufactured pseudo-soul! Don't forget the rarities on this one! (Kent)"
5,Most beautiful vocal Jazz album I've ever heard,"This album has captured me from the moment I first put it on - and after hundreds of listening sessions it still grabs hold and won't let go. The interplay of Mr. Murphy and Frank Chastenier especially is simply otherwordly. And Mr. Brönners warm tone fits the whole set perfectly, as does the smooth violin accompaniment. An absolute must-have for music lovers of every genre.Buy this album (Don't buy it used! Support the artists!). You won't regret it."
5,Exceedingly valuable,"While Gems 1 will always have a special place in my heart, this book solidly builds on the foundation of Gems 1 & 2.New techniques are revealed, and previous ones are expanded and enhanced. Every phase of game design is covered, from design to AI to graphics to audio.If you are a game designer, you cannot afford to pass this one by."
2,Some recipes aren't quite there yet,"I've owned this book for over a year and have used it when planning for a few parties. Some of the recipes are excellent, but others just don't taste good. I am an avid cook, and have had to improvise a number of times when the finished recipe was completed because the appetizer was close to tasteless (example: the dipping sauce for the Rockin Rubens as well as the Rockin Ruben breadsticks themselves; Dab a Crab was dab-a-boring).I have found that I use Cocktail Food now more for inspiration than to follow the actual recipes. I too found the recipe names a little too cute, so most of the time my appetizers go incognito when people ask about the actual names."
3,Not Impressed,"I was not particularly impressed with this book. The recipes have clever names of old standbys. The photography is nice and the directions are clear, so it is a plus for those items, but there isn't really anything new and innovative here."
1,Waste of money,This kit sounds like a giant hunk of poo. Lack of accessories and believable patches make it hard to even practice with.
2,American Icon Gone Silly,"About 25 minutes into this drearly little film, a gang of British thugs send a little boy into the path of an oncoming truck after trying to steal his cell phone. The ""gang"" was a white kid, a West Indian kid, and a black kid--the precise makeup of a Politically Correct street gang in a Marvel Comic book circa 1975.That about sums up what happened to this once masterful, but now sadly uninteresting American icon of a director. Next Eastwood is remaking A Star Is Born with Beyonce. Once daring, Eastwood now makes the boring, safe choices guaranteed to garner applause from the Hollywood establishment, and yawns from the public.Please Clint, retire now..."
2,Lead to boredom,The movie could have been much more but instead became a boring. I waited to see if the plot would escalate but it plateaued early and made it difficult to keep interested.
2,"good idea, but...","first, PLEASE mr. eastwood: stop scoring your own movies! the overly-sentimental music takes all the edge out of this film (and the guitarist plays as if handcuffed to a written score). this really bothered me; much of the drama in ""hereafter"" is diluted by the music.there is a good idea (several actually) floating around here, but the movie is slow, plodding. we have to wait a long time for the inevitable: that these people will somehow connect, and share something. a great subject, just needed to be told with more urgency, ""magic"" even.am inspired to watch ""gran turino"" again; a smaller film, but a much-better one..."
1,DONT DO IT !!!!!,you need to pass on this one !!2 hours and it was all bad after the first 10 min.SUPER SLOW !!!!!!!
1,Don't believe the hype,"This is a lackluster movie made from a mediocre screenplay. The trailer makes this look like an exciting thriller. It is neither exciting nor a thriller. It is a long boring mess that doesn't know what it wants to do. For serious Matt Damon fans only. For fans of the director Clint Eastwood class this one as ""Fail""."
3,Zzzzzzzzzz---too predictable,"could've been a better movie. pretty boring. this was a disappointment, a basic evening's entertainment and if you're not careful, you'll fall asleep."
3,Quality of product excellent,"There was a lot left unexplored in this film, although the premises were very interesting. I felt a little let down with the simplicity of the story line. I like the actors very much, and the recreation of the tsunami was believable, especially in light of the footage we have seen since Japan's tragedy.The quality of the DVD and the timliness of the receipt were very good and I would definately purchase from this vendor again and again."
2,Boring,You wait a long time for this movie to get interesting -- and then it's over. The interesting part doesn't happen.
3,Not what I expected.,"I expected a supernatural tale somewhere along the lines of white noise, instead a got a look at different relationships that had been touched in different ways by death. Good enough just not what I expected."
1,Two+ hours wasted,"Disconnected and implausible plot with horrible sound and subtitles. There were long scenes in which the dialogue was almost inaudible. The subtitles were so small as to be nearly unreadable AND white subtitles on a pale background......I found it generally boring with little satisfaction as each character's ""situation"" was resolved.Give me Gran Torino any day for a movie with plot and heart."
5,Something Different About The End,Hereafter is a different thought of what happens to you in the afterlife. If you can open up to this idea you might even think that this could happen. The woman who experienced death and the young boy searching for an answer about his brother kept you wanting to know more and stay involved in the story the whole way through. If you are closed minded skip this one.
1,Could this movie have been more boring?,"No.A major snooze-fest.Avoid it like the plague unless you have insomnia.__________________________________129 minutes of my life...... wasted.Hopefully I'll get them back in the ""Hereafter"". Because I sure squandered them in this lifetime."
2,Really not that great....,"So we have a guy moping around feeling cursed at being blessed with a gift. Then there's the woman who briefly experienced death while being overtakened and nearly drowned by a Tsunami. She then has visions of the little girl she tried to save. A boy, who loses his twin brother in a horrible accident, and has a drug addicted mom.The movie starts out great as the three stories are introduced. I was hooked and looking forward to all the possible angles, theories that could have been analyzed about death, dying, and our ultimate stop. It didn't happen. It was a story about how death affects three people and the emotions that go along with losing someone, even if that someone is you.Very slow paced, and the ending left alot to be desired. The last 5 minutes turned into a romantic love story, with our guy Matt practically drooling while he fantasizes like a school boy about kissing and holding a girls hand.I expected a little more from this movie."
1,Netflicks replacement video,"We ordered it to replace a lost netflics video. I did not order blue ray. Netflicks is not crediting our account. There is a previous owner un-removable sticker on it. This was a complete waste of money.Netflicks verbally over the phone said it would be fine. I think one of the reasons they wont accept it, is due to the label on the DVD."
1,"Are these sizes for women, men or unisex?","I'm confused, why show a chart of women, men and then UNISEX. But offer only one size chart? Therefore, is the Large size for women or men or Unisex?"
4,Very pleased,Very pleased with the price and prompt service of my order. The product was just what I needed. Thanks
4,Wedding ceremony planner,"This book was an excellent bridge for my daughter (untraditional) and son, who was performing the ceremony (very traditional). Together they were able to put together a beautiful compromise. It also gave us guidelines on what was needed for a complete program."
5,Great advice for many types of weddings,"My Mom, our officiant, found this book and recommended I pick up a copy. The ceremony was one of the last things we nailed down but I was able to use her structure and some of what she wrote, add our own stuff, and the end result was wonderful. Neither the groom nor I are religious or spiritual, but I still wanted an emotional and meaningful celebration of our relationship. This was the first book I read that really treated that like an option. But also had lots of stuff for people who would want a religious ceremony."
1,profit from death,I trust the author and everyone who profits from the sale of this book will be donating a portion of their income to the family of the girl who was murdered on this man's farm? It's disgusting to see people profiting from crime.
1,"Doesn't work, Linksys recommends the WMP11 instead.","The WDT11 will work if you buy the WPC11 version 1. The problem is, no one sells the WPC11 version 1. The current version of WPC11 is version 3, and Linksys customer service told me that version 3 doesn't work with the WDT11 (it works fine in a laptop). Linksys customer service recommended the newer WMP11 card which is made for desktops. This WDT11 is an adapter to get the laptop peripheral WPC11 to work in a desktop."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I bought the WDT11 and it seemed to work fine except that my computer would no longer perform a RESTART (W2K) after installation unless I unplugged the WPC11 from it. Linksys tech support was clueless as to the cause of the problem, and could not help except to exchange the unit. Of course the replacement did not allow a restart either. The downgrade is not necessarily for the unit so much as for the cluelessness of Linksys support. I have Dell hardware, so it's not as if I am running rogue hardware! I can SHUTDOWN and reboot normally, however."
2,This may not be what you think!,"I do not think this is not a PCI card to connect your desktop computer to a wireless hub. It is very important to read the technical information about this card. It should say ""ONLY campatible with the Linksys Instant Wireless network PC Card (wpc11)"". This is the card used in a laptop configuation. I do not think this is supposed to be used like a wireless connection for your desktop computer (Internet Server) to a hub. It is more like a cross over cable for desktop computer to laptop solution.If you are looking for quick, limited, solution this will work just fine. I am not saying that this card will *not* connect to a hub, I just do not think that conecting to a hub is what this product was meant to do.If you are pointing this card into a wall or hide it in a desk it is not going to work well. I bought this and sent it back at my expense because I did not read the fine print.Good Luck with your wireless adventure. I am sure it will be changing soon."
4,Good for beginners,"Very good book. Full of details. Could go a little further into the kitchen matter. You will need another book on food cost calculation, once this one does not cover it all the way."
4,Can Perry and Croft ever go wrong? No!,"Yet another comedy from the pens of David Croft and Jimmy Perry. This show follows the misadventures of a group of misfits working at a holiday camp in late 1950's Britain.Although its probably not one of their best shows, its still hilarious and much better than most of the comedic fare you'll see these days. I hope that the BBC releases more episodes of this one as its more ""serialized"" than other Croft and Perry stories; that is, there are story threads that continue from episode to episode and leave you wanting to know ""what happens next."" Greatly recommended!"
4,"Good diving/travel logs, with great underwater photography","This set is actually 4 Sport Diver tv shows on 2 video cassettes. If you have ever seen the show, it is a travel log type format with diving as the focus. This is not an instructional set but sort of an introduction to places a diver might want to investigate further. We really enjoyed the tapes and think they are a steal for the price!! They are fast paced shows and tend to repeat information every now and then but with that kind of scenery to look at, who cares!!!"
5,need-to-know info,"Thank you for creating and sharing this vital, need-to-know information. Through this kind of knowledge we can change the planet. Peace."
4,Creates a great cake,"This is a great cake. I suggest figuring it out beforehand and doing a trial run. I used all pound cake, and would add in a regular mix too to lighten up the texture but still make the cake solid enough to stand up. Decorating it is a bit tedious, but that is something that goes along with making a different type of cake. I bought it with the mini bear to use as a smash cake for our one year old."
3,Family Tree review,"This book was OK. It certainly humanized blue bloods. I would have liked for the book to go deeper. I have a first generation bi-racial family which is what attracted me to the book, that's my perspective. I thought the reactions were a bit simple and just scratched the surface of what life holds for them. People, including her loved ones, were much nicer than what they would be in real life. She should have had to deal more with what plain ole strangers will say to her."
5,Could Not Put It Down,"This book had me from when I was reading when it was about. I could not put it down. Will definitely go down as one of my FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIMES!!! If anyone knows any other books like this, please let me know!!"
1,Totally Implausable,"Even when I read fiction, I expect authenticity. It is totally implausable that 3 generations away, the source of a great granddaughter's brown skin was her biracial great grandfather. According to the premise of this romance, no one along this line ever married a person of color either. I even asked a genetic counselor who concurred with me that the premise is implausable.Otherwise, I agree with Dera's review of the problems with this novel."
3,Just OK,"I thought this book was just okay. It had very good, moving parts in it, but the whole stiching thing threw me off. I didn't know half the time what the author was saying when she was writing about knitting, because I've never done it before. And the whole think about Earl was sortof not needed, since Ellie Jo made a big fuss out of it (and it had nothing to do with the outcome, like I would have assumed). Overall, it was a fast read, with a sweet ending, but I wouldn't suggest any of my friends read it."
5,Total enjoyment,Family TreeI loved this book and couldn't put it down. Ms Delinsky has been a favorite of mine for a very long time. I will continue to read her books as long as she continues writes them.
2,Not very engrossing and easy to lose interest,"This really sounded like a good concept. Interesting plot, etc. However, I found this book to be borderline boring and hard to follow. In fact, I found it to be very self indulgent and the characters unsympathetic.I could hardly finish the book and found myself wanting to skip ahead pages to get this finished. Despite the fact that they had a newborn, this was ALL they could talk about and seemed like they had discussions with random people. Seemed unrealistic."
3,Conversation Piece,"I wanted to love this book - honestly! Our reading group selected this title and I must admit, it sparked one of the most interesting discussions ever. So kudos to the author for bringing up an intriguing and personal issue which is rarely spoken of, and introducing it to readers to think and talk about. Giving birth to a child who has different racial characteristics isn't something most folks would imagine. However, we did have a book club member who actually did experience having a child of a much lighter color, (and might have some white ancestry somewhere) so it was a reverse of the book's theme. We got an education on this subject from that member as well as the book itself.As far as the writing of the book, it seemed a little mild, not creating a lot of tension or excitement, and had several minor story lines which didn't really go anywhere. Don't read this book for the great writing. Read it because the subject is fascinating, and tell your friends."
4,Just scimmed the surface!,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this book, however it ended with so many issues unresolved and incomplete. The premise of this book had me eagerly anticipating it's arrival, however while the plot could have gone so many ways, it left me waiting for just ONE PERSON to stand up to Hugh or Eaton to explain that being of mixed heritage is not a bad thing! I had hoped it would be Dana or her mother-in-law to no avail. That is my only criticism however. I loved how all of the characters intertwined by the end, and have already ordered more Delinsky novels. This was an interesting ready that I can only hope will spark more novels on this subject."
3,A great idea for a book that could have been better,"I decided to read this book because a white couple having a baby with African-American features sounded like an interesting story. It could have been a much better story. Family Tree was a very quick read - too quick, in my opinion. I didn't feel that I got to know any of the characters very well, and what I did learn didn't make me like them too much. The husband insists on a DNA test too squash any rumors about the paternity the baby. Of course, he didn't suspect his wife of infidelity. Yeah, right. Not liking the idea of a DNA test, she still goes a long with it. How could she ever trust him after his apparent lack of trust in her? The wife's reaction to her long-lost father was too harsh. Save your money. I would recommend checking the book out of the library if you need a quick read for an airline flight or a lazy afternoon."
4,Really Moving !,"Slight disappointment on the lack of mariachi, however, solid musical enjoyment. But, also came with a bonus DVD featuring material of Del Castillo, and those guitars are just incredibly riveting, and so hot. Wow!"
4,LOVED IT!!!,"What a great read! I read it over Memorial Day weekend, and I couldn't have picked a better beach book. I got so caught up in it that every now and then, I actually glanced toward the horizon to see if maybe--just maybe I could see a sinuous neck plowing through the waters. The book is funny and whimsical, yet the characters are so well portrayed that in no time at all, the reader gets sucked into the action, never doubting that one way or another, the meeting between humans and Monster will make for a fantastic climax of the story. Any more books where that one came from?"
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this mystery series, but unfortunately this first book fell way short of my expectations. Not toward the metaphysical aspects, but toward the more important aspects of storytelling and characters. There was so much the author could have done with this story that was just not done. And quite frankly, I felt as though I were reading a failed attempt at a romance novel with too much plot. I kept reading, mostly because I thought, surely now . . . but eventually gave up around the 3/4 point because the mystery didn't matter and the characters wavered back and forth so much that I just didn't care."
1,Reading THIS is a waste of time,"Robin Cooper thinks he is funnier than he is. Essentially a one-idea book, he fills page after page with puerile letters to recipients with names and/or addresses which are particularly silly or peculiarly British (or both). The greatest humour lies in the fact that these addresses are real, rather than in anything that his limited wit is able to request of the addressee. Added to that is the fact that none of the replies really transcends the bland, or takes the game up to him, and the whole thing is really a rather onerous affair.To call this adolescent is being grossly unfair to adolescents: read 2 pages in the bookshop and put it back on the shelf."
1,card,"Bought the card and it ran fine for a few weeks, then suddenly without any changes to hardware/software the card started to freeze in 3D games. I thought it was a driver issue so i tried ALL drivers... Still no stable system now i've finally been able to get my system stable enough for 3D games. With Fast Write of, AGP set to 4x. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CARD TO ANYONE."
3,Ariel,"Ariel's bra top should have been painted on as with the Fairytopia dolls. The flimsy bikini feels like foil and comes off too easily. Naturally Ariel either ends up nude waist up or in our case wearing another Barbie dress. THe tie-on fins are too fiddly to detach and reattach. Ariel's cute but cartoony; not as exquisite as I would have hoped they would have rendered her the ""Barbie"" way."
1,ACTUAL RETAIL PRICE IS NOT CORRECT,"THIS GUITAR DOES NOT RETAIL AT $1,200.00 and should be corrected by the vendor. False information to lead buyers into thinking they are getting a great offer. You can pick this guitar up for the price listed at many different shops, either online or local. DO NOT PURCHASE based off of the listed retail price! This guitar is good for beginner/intermediate players."
4,Generous Digital Art Over The Pages,"Length:: 0:46 MinsThis book had no storyboards, very little character designs but lots of digitally painted concept art. These digitally painted frames focus heavily on the sets and environment.These panels were generously applied across the pages, sometimes taking 1 to 2 pages for just one panel, making them very satisfying to look at. They were intended to bring readers into the magical world.Art captions explained the concept behind them, and the story it was intended to tell. Text copy were kept to a minimum and the typography used was huge, perhaps, for the children audience.This movie was made with motion capture but nothing in the book that showed you visually how it was done. There were few 3D renders or life sculptures, strangely.Overall, the book was a visual delight.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"
4,Good product.,Very good organizer. Overall a fair price for a good product. Wish it was available in metal
5,Stay Organized!,"Strange as it seems, this was a major upgrade from a cheaper, smaller organizer that I used to have that I replaced because the lid became warped. This organizer is vastly superior with its comfortable carrying handle/grip, removable trays that can be moved around anywhere inside, sturdy lid, and tight locking clips. I use it to store all kinds of things from nails, to hangers, to zip-ties. Nothing ever gets mixed accidentally with another compartment, and it stores a lot of stuff! It's slim, light, and thus easy to store! If you've got a bunch of screws, nails, thumbtacks, marbles, jelly beans, whatever... get this and clean up your mess!"
2,I'm disappointed in you Maynard,Being a huge Tool and A P C fan i was incredibly pissed off when i wasted 15 bucks on this suck job. About every song on the CD is a remake which is somthing I was unaware of when I purcased this thing. I was looking forward to the album a great deal. The first two sounded so good and then this. I still love tool and maynard but I'll never purchase another Perfect Circle album. Save your money and buy 4 gallons of gasoline.
5,A Perfect Circle Has Evolved!,"Dear Maynard,You are a genius. Just what we needed in these times. A verymature approach to the problems of today. I am going to makesure and tell everyone about this work of art. Thanks fortackling the important and controversial topic of war. I amnow sure that I voted in the best interest of my children!P.S. Great job on all the covers. Especially the Devo song.- Freedom of Choice, Is what you've got!"
3,A Curate's Egg,"Quite why this record exists is a mystery. It doesn't seem to be a `proper' APC release, comprising as it does all covers save for two perfunctory originals... but the tracks (and the albums excellent artwork) all hang around a loose anti-war feel so some sort of concept may be afoot. What you get is in places strange (a gothic take on Marvin Gaye's `What's Going On', anyone?), strangely successful (Joni Mitchell's `Fiddle And The Drum') or just rubbish (a terrible version of Black Flag's `Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie'). It's a Curate's Egg, but the good parts outweigh the bad. Interesting."
3,give it a chance,"now i know apc went in the wrong direction with this, as far as 75% of peoples reviews seem to show. At first i thought what everyone else did. I laughed, Maynard singing bout peace and what not, Maynard, the all mighty hater of all life who wants the world to be flooded (aenima) This albums is mostly covers of old hippy songs. I Will admit they did rape what other legends worked hard for (Lennon, Gaye) The only song i did enjoy was passive (their own song) and their other attempt counting bodies? ughhh. Wow apc did a cover of a song from their last album and raped that too lol. I can't defend this album, as much as i adore maynard and his work. I think its noe been put to shame. Wait for there next effort, i'm surei t will more than make up for this travesty."
3,sedation = peace,"After the first few listens, this CD is skating the line between getting shelved and getting more chances. The main thing that comes to mind with this disc is its persistently slow pace. The pace may be appropriate for the theme of peace, but from the standpoint of my expectations with perfect circle, there's not much energy. It is relaxing though. Maybe the songs will catch on more later, but on first impression it disappoints from the standpoint of perfect circle's more sonically busy material."
1,I liked Tool,"And thirteenth step, and mar de nomsSometimes it seemed like depressing music just to be depressing, but hey, maynard has a great voiceBut this CD.....First of all, not every song has to sound like a funeral march. Ok...its creative once, but Turning heavy/punk songs into dirges isnt really that creative. Also it seems like Maynard missed the point of some of these songs. Like Imagine, its subtle, its hopeful, its not upbeat....but come on...its like the sound of depression, in the worst way you could possible imagine"
3,meh,"What i think the problem with this CD is the band namesake. I think the remakes are all pretty good attempts at different outlooks. But where the qaulity of the cd becomes mixed up is when you tie it in with who made it. APC is capable of much better production values than this and Maynerd just doesn't sound excited or anything. That makes this cd lose a TON of its value. If he had sung with his usual passion it would be better but as it is, it leaves an uneasy knot in APC fans stomachs XP. Even though it is a bit mediocre Maynerd has once again succeeded. Look at all the publicity it is getting just because of all the mixed reviews people are going to buy to see for themselves."
1,"Wow, Bad","A perfect circle is a great band. But I may never buy one again after this stupid album. The first two albums released were wonderful. This one stunk worse then a fresh turd. They are surposed to be hard core, destroy the world type of a band. Not whining little anti war cry babies. Don't buy it, buy the other two!"
2,"Sounds good, but it's annoying to listen to","Good grief...when bands like APC are so...ugh, i can't even express this in words.I really don't like when artists try to push agenda's on me. Allow me to refrain that, if they want to push an agenda, at least make it thought provoking and insightful.""Imagine""...GNR?...lyrics like ""your given a voice you dont want it seems to be a rule of thumb...i say it again in the land of the free use your freedom of choice""""people are people so why should it be 'you and i shouldn't get a long' ""Come on, this is so elementary and bland and boring. Ack!"
1,I really wanted to stop listening,I will be succinct. This album is poo. Emotive has all the whimsy of a quick trip to the toilet. Pish posh!
2,After one listen I'm going to sell this for US$3,"I'd rate APCs previous album 13th step the best album I've heard in my life, however emotive is basically just a poo that your flat mate left in the toiletI quite liked the tracks 2-5, but from there on the rest of the album (except track 11) is unlistenableNow I could go down the same path I did when I brought Cafe Del Mar 8, Master of Orion III, etc, and *try* to like them, but the reality is you shouldn't ever have to *try* to like something, either you like it or you don'tSo I'm just going to sell it and listen to music that I actually likePerhaps the spirtually inclined Maynard is trying to teach us a lesson in non-attachment e.g. it's not the poor album that is bad, it is your attachment and your expectations that are making you sadIt's also a spritualy lesson in karma. Just think of all those great cd's that you pirated in the past. You purchasing this is just your karma coming back to bite you :D"
1,Truly a cheap political commentary,"There is little here that is musically interesting. I am a fan of Tool and even moreso APC's previous albums, so I bought this one off the shelf the minute I saw it. I would gladly return it if I could. Instead of buying this album, you can come find me and I will pull my largely unused copy out of the CD case in which it has remained for the last 5 years.I think the band might possibly have made this entire CD in one weekend, when they sat around on a Friday, and said, ""you know, let's make a political statement with a new album."" They then spent the next 72 hours remixing some old stuff, putting some boring experimental tracks together, and sent it to the presses for release by Monday.If you don't own one of APC's previous two albums, buy either or both of those instead, and save your money on this boring piece of trash."
3,"mediocre album, not up to APC standards","well APC's first two albums were amazing i must say. i love every song by them. i thought they would keep getting better and better. but this album dissappointed me.best song - passivei love this song, mabye download it or buy the single if there is onethe cover of imagine.. butchered.. not good at all.most of the songs have this weird techno-sound to them.. which i dont like. it just sounds.. blah. not too good. the political motivated stuff (basically the whole album) is a negative. dont like it at all. lets just hope APC can produce another amazing album, and we'll leave this one behind and hopefully forget about it."
2,A Very Common Story,"We've seen it before. Music artists get political. Well Maynard picked the low hanging fruit on this one. Lyrically ready for a third grade audience. Trite melodies. A patronizingly simple theme informing listeners that they are all sheep and that they have the freedom of choice to stop the war. Gee...I wonder where they got this idea from.Despite my disappointment with the album as a whole, a high point is track 10 ""Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums"". This track happens to be a remix of 'Pet' from Thirteenth Step. So the most worthwhile track is only a new and improved version of something I have already paid for.If you are a PC fan, like I have been, you may want to avoid this disk. It is better to remember Perfect Circle the way they used to be...with a spine."
2,"Interesting effort, reasonably well produced., hypocritical","My only gripe is that this is a total screed against war and yet seems to penetrate through the responsibility of government to the ""wallets"". Sure, war profiteering is certainly one aspect of war, but the last time I checked, war is something that a State has to declare. IT is the main recipient of any benefits to be culled from war. Ultimately IT holds the power in its hands, and at best it trades its power to other Big Interests, whatever they may be.It is hilarious that the left decries war, but adores Statism. Perhaps that is due to the endless force it has at its disposal to wield in other forms other than war. That, apparently, is all well and fine. And in so doing prop up the beast.Welfare breeds warfare, warfare breeds welfare...."
1,Not Needed or Wanted,"Maynard James Keenan releases music so rarely that when he does, we the fans deserve more than an album of cover songs. This honestly really pisses me off because if the creative talent of A Perfect Circle which has more talent than any other band out there right now cannot manage to write and record 12 new songs for their 3rd CD then what is the world coming to? Seriously, how many years now since a Tool album? And we get this? Maynard singing John Lennon?!?! I'm outraged and disgusted and you should be too."
2,Hmmmmmm,"This album is really not what I expected from Maynard. Its definitely progressive. It is a little too political or ""world view"" for me. The peace preaching is good. He raped butchered one of the greatest songs ever written. I wish I could ""imagine"" him not perverting it but it does fit the theme of this album so I forgive him. I originally thought it was someone like staind or that maynard sound alike band that covered ""imagine"" which infuriated me to no end but learning it was Maynard and the context he used it eased the tension somewhat. Its not a ""rock"" type of cover. His version of ""What's goin on"" is interesting. Either this album is way ahead of its time and totally misunderstood or its the first garbage I have heard out of Maynard. At first sound I'm not too impressed but maybe it will grow on me."
2,Great Message... Poor Delivery,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's."
1,Worst Album of the Year,Been a Huge Tool and APC fan for years but this is the worst album they've ever done. There are only 2 good songs and the rest are horrible attempts at covering. It sounds as if they made the album in 1 day in a garage. They should stick to writing awesome music instead of getting into politics.
1,What happened Maynard?,"2 or 3 songs here are worth hearing, and one of those is a remix. Otherwise this album is just boring/prententious political messages given in the form of butcheries of good songs."
5,Feel Good or Feel Goddess Music,"I play Karen's music when I'm having a bad day to change my view of things and it always works! And on a good day - well, I just walk through life singing her songs and chants."
2,Bad Mattress,"The frame is good and sturdy, but the mattress in the picture is not what you receive. The mattress is really cheap and went flat very quickly. We use this as a full time bed, slept on every night. You could completely feel the slats of the frame within a couple of weeks. It also hangs over the frame awkwardly and makes it hard to put up into a bed.I read other reviews that said the mattress was thick and comfortable. I believe they are now sending a different mattress. I received the white one pictured in the products pictures. It is not comfortable."
1,She's only 10 months and we need a new stroller,"I have to say that I was happy with this stroller at first. We have been using it for about 6 months now. For the most part it is pretty sturdy, lightweight, and easy to manuever. But the problem that I am having now is that the button located on the handle that you use to fold it up, doesn't always work. So, I am often stranded in parking lots, with my daughter sitting in the car, waiting for us to go, and I am outside of the car, struggling with the stroller, trying to get it to close!!! The other day I almost just left it in the mall parking lot (I was attemting to close it for atleast 20 minutes), when I finally just cleared out the trunk of my car and stuck it in there unfolded.I wouldn't recommend this product. It has caused me more frustration than I can explain in writing!!!"
5,Sweet Victory,"WOW. This is outstanding. I am proud of the people who have a poem on this book, I can very much say you are wonderfull writers. I am also proud of myself, I finally got my poem published. After all my poetry is doing much better than my singing career. Congratulations to you all again."
4,Unfairly overlooked,"Dean Ray deserved better. As far as I know, this is his only professional recording. The record (which I have) or the tape features good, basic rock and roll. Perhaps Dean Ray's music simply didn't fit the temper of the times. But those people who like unpretentious, heartfelt, ""classic"" rock and roll will enjoy this work."
2,Disjointed,"Sigurd (the Hero) started out as a suspicious twit, and never changed. Some of the characters are inconsistent. Why would Ragnhild start fawning over the main character, after he helped 'magick' her horse into almost drowning her? I got the book for free, got my money's worth."
3,Good with an inexplicable omission,"The author writes about something economists know but refuse to acknowledge namely, the futility of applying math to represent human behavior...It is simply not possible! These economists will never accept it because it would mean sending them all to the unemployed line...The great omission is not to have mentioned the Austrian school of economics and their great contributions. Not even when he discusses the Marginalists... Astonishing unless his knowledge of economics is not as thorough as expected"
5,Wonderful!,"After getting a facial and having a bunch of the Eminence products used, I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay for everything the woman recommend. I ending up buying it all. This cleasner along with a couple of the other products has helped clear up my acne that Pro active couldn't. The cleanser feels great and doesn't bleach your wash cloths!! Also a little bit goes a long way, so the bottle last!!! try it!!!"
4,Good Lights...but complicated,"I have a Harley Davidson Sportster 883 XL. The lights were very hard to adjust...you either have to remove the wire to adjust them or have a specialized socket to use in order to adjust without removing the wire. (FYI...I made a socket with a notch in it simply by using a hand tool grinder and cutting the notch in the socket) It took me 2 evenings of working on these lights to get them to work properly. I had to redo the wiring in one of the turn signal lights because it wasn't in right and the light would not stay on. I also had to take off my engine guard because the lights hit it and I could not turn.All in all, they are good lights. Made a huge difference in being able to see clearly at night. After you get passed the installation you are good. They just need a better way to adjust them."
3,squeaky clark sandals,"These sandals were very comfortable but they squeaked quite loudly whenever I walked. This was very annoying and a little embarrassing at work. I looked on google to find a solution. I sprayed them all over with W-D 40 and rubbed them with hand lotion. The next day the squeak was gone. They're fine now, but I would not have ordered them if I had known about this problem before hand."
5,Shake Face,"Ever try to make a milkshake in a blender that does not have a lid? Don't! It sucks. I bought this lid as a replacement for my Kitchenaid blender that lost its lid during a move to Utah. I tried a plate for a while and eventually broke down and bought this replacement lid. I'm glad I did. The removable center section doubles as a measuring device and when it is out, it is easy to add ingredients to the blender while it is running. The white material is a soft rubber that probably should be hand-washed. It goes in my dishwasher, though, and seems to be fairing well. This is a good product and should be included with any Kitchenaid blender...especially the ones who lose their top when they move to another state."
1,Blemished,The Box itself was solid but the one I received has what looks to be paint splattered all over it. I tryed to get it off but it didnt work. Not a reflection on the product but on the company. How can you knowingly send out a defective product. Bad form...
2,Poor design,"Not impressed with this box. First of all, their idea of camo looks like they melted a brown and green crayon together, box is ugly. Second, the small box for other items is junk. Seems like they coudld have spent more than 5 minutes designing this product so the components would fit better."
4,The Only 80's Comp CD I own!,"I hate every track list from every 80's comp cd I've ever seen. This one was utterly different. From the beginning to end, this cd rocks!"
5,Performs as Advertised.,"For those of us who just don't want to live in the half-duplex single-pipeline, high-latency low-reliability world of wireless, this switch is the perfect centerpiece of a home network. It's cheap, fast, and reliable. Of course, you'll need copper in your walls and an a socket in each room, but once you've got that in place, you'll have a home network that isn't susceptible to your daughter's cell phone, the kitchen microwave or your neighbor's motion detector."
1,Keep looking......Very boring!,"This book was utilized in a psychology of religion class I just took and it is boring beyond belief. Much of the research that was used in the examples were questionable. (Sample sizes were too small and control of extraneous variables in some seemed non-existant). This field of psychology is very young and needs books that can present credible research in a way that can stimulate interest. This book constantly says more research is needed in this or that area, but does little to show that the field has any credibility to it."
3,Too small,Should have paid more attention to the dimensions way too smallGave it to my daughter. Nice look thought and very well made
5,"useful, and fun",Not only is this information incredibly useful but its also alot of fun to read. I love how it goes from hiding places for little things to large and large things until finally some toungue-in-cheek jokes about hiding a house or hiding a corporation
5,The White Witch Was Real,"I recently traveled to Jamaica and visited the Rosehall Great House. It is amazing and enchanting. Our guide told us a similar tale as presented in this book, although it's obvious that the people there still fear the White Witch very much. Her ghost is said to linger and haunt the people on the plantation to this very day. I recommend a visit to anyone who has read and enjoyed this book as much as I did."
1,no hardwear,didnt send me any bolts to put it in so now i have to find some but the got it shiped out very fast
4,Evinrude is running again,"I have a 1971 Evenrude 9.5HP outboard that suddenly started acting up. I tried rebuilding the old fuel pump with a kit from another source but did not have much luck. It worked some of the time. Not the kind of reliability you want in a boat motor.So I purchased this unit for a lot less than the OMC version. I had to change the orientation of the Inlet in relation to the pump body, but no big deal. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the aluminum base on this pump is much thicker than the original and my mountin screws were not long enough to get into the block, which caused a little bit of a hassle finding appropriate screws. Outside of that I would have given it 5 stars.Sally's Husband."
5,Quality Hello Kitty Clock,"We can highly recommend this Hello Kitty Clock/Radio/Nightlight. Not only is it very cute with Hello Kitty but the sound quality on it is better than most. The lemon slice on the side of the ""teacup"" lights up nicely for a childs night light. Not too bright but gives a nice glow.The price is good and it is nice quality."
5,Very Cute Clock,I saw that a lot of people said that the radio was messed up. but mine worked fine it is so cute. like if your room is dark it is easy 2 find the snooze button
5,A hoot!!,"You have to give Blake Edwards and his courageous cast credit for having the nerve to make this film. It is irreverent, often over the top, and is pretty merciless in commenting on the Hollywood system. This film is not his masterpiece, but certainly one of his most personal statements. The picture quality of the DVD is excellent--good color, good definition, etc. The sound is so-so but, since it isn't a musical, that doesn't really matter too much. Supposedly, Edwards worked on this screenplay for years, as a reaction to the treatment he and his wife received from Paramount--especially during and after the filming of their mega-flop, ""Darling Lili."" Most folks now agree that ""Lili"" is a darned-good film and exhibits some of Edwards' and Andrews' best traits. When can we see this film on DVD?? And why not package it with with S.O.B. as a double set!!!"
5,Bought this for the e-cig!,"I put this in a 50/50 combo of VG and PG (I'm completely off nicotine, now.. but I love to vape and it helps me NOT smoke) The vape store started watering their e-liquid down.. so I decided to make my own. I love the crisp, strong cinnamon taste. Perfect!"
2,Nothing exceptional,"I watched episodes 1 to 3 and half of 4. The first episode looked good enough to persue the series, but I even neglected to finish watching the fourth one. It is a story in an alternate world which is lacking the essential ressource of water. Everything is very dark: bloody war, insane leaders wanting to ""bring peace"" to the world, children in difficult war situations. Maybe it gets better later on, but I did not think there was much of a plot or a point this far."
5,A girl Admiring the sunset,"From the first episode, you might think this is going to be a comedy. You think it'll be goofy and funny. You think it's going to be light-hearted. That all changes when you watch episode two. This is not a comedy. It is not goofy nor funny. Also, it is not light-hearted. It is a tragic and epic story that'll move you to tears. It is filled with horrible characters like Hamdo and Naboo. It is also filled with violence and rape. Although you don't see the rape of Sara, you can feel what has happened to her. This is one of the saddest shows out there. It is filled with good people, if only a few. Any anime fan would be a fool if they don't have this wonderful show in thier collection."
5,Great series book,Book 2 was as good as book 1. So touching - I couldn't put it down - not even after reading several times. Something new hits me each time I read it.
4,The true story on this series,"Marvel has reprinted the Frank Miller issues of DD in 3 volumes. The first volume shipped November 2000, and the second volume shipped in April 2001. The third volume shipped November 2001. Volume 1 reprints #158-161, 163-167. Miller provides the cover and an introduction. Volume 2 reprints #168-182. Diana Schutz provides the introduction. Volume 3 reprints #183-191, along with two 'What If?' stories and the Elektra Bizarre Adventures story. Graphitti Designs produced limited hardcovers of all 3 volumes.The regular edition of Daredevil Visionaries: Kevin Smith tpb reprints Daredevil #1-8 of Volume 2, in softcover. There is a hardcover edition from Graphitti Designs which includes a CD-ROM and is signed by Smith, Quesada and Palmiotti."
5,Miller leads DD down a new path,"Frank Miller's work for Marvel up to this time was usual fare. But when he started on DD, he developed a greater cinematic style not seen in comics before. If you get this volume and the next two, you'll see Miller take over the writing chores and then the blend of words and layouts really shines. The gritty look that Klaus Jansen gives Miller's art works well. If you actually study the panels, the art is crude at times--look at the proportions of feet and hands to heads, for example; yet the cinematic layouts make it work. Overall, this was a milestone in the history of comics that true fans shouldn't miss."
3,Too short,I rented this from a nameless online rental source. It was very short and not worth the money. I'm glad I only rented it.
2,Not bad but not good.....,"I just bought this today and was really excited to used it. I work out daily on the treadmill, stationary bike or use my pilates dvd...that was getting pretty boring. I'm an experienced dancer so I skipped the first 3 dvds and went straight to this one. The lap dance dvd was VERY short and the moves were just repeated twice. Not too much to it! Now the hip hop one wasn't bad. I've used some of the moves before in dance team routines and such, but running in place? Sorry, I've never seen that done and it made Carmen Electra look like she was lost and running in circles. I don't think it was worth what I paid for it and I now regret *not* reading the reviews before I purchased this dvd. I'm hoping the 2nd one might be a little more of a cardio workout for me! By the way, does anyone know how to change the music on the dvd?? it says you can change the music for the workout but everytime I tried it went right back to the music it was playing the first time!"
2,The Lap Dance-Bootleg Worthy,"This isn't really a workout and not a real lap dance either.There is a short warm up with Carmen and two other girls.Afterwards, Carmen shows you the steps to her lap dance. She does the lap dance on an empty chair. No lap. The idea is that our audience will watch us dirty dance on an empty chair. I think that's a little odd.Anyway, she breaks the routine into shorter segments and at the end she does the entire routine. It's extremely easy to follow. There is a backbend that might be difficult for some though.You can modify the moves so that they make sense if you dance for a person.I think it's okay, if you need a few pointers in lap dances. I wouldn't buy this DVD. You should only rent it or get the bootleg from your friend."
2,Thankfully the world isn't filled with just women!,"I got this at the library and watched it, and it was sort of strange,to see just women and narry a man in sight! And none of these women were real women in my opinion, they were catty, gossipy, busybodies that were annoying...I wouldn't want any of these women for my friend, and what man would want one of these women? Except for Norma, of course. She was the only character who made the film worth watching. This film was worth a one-time watch, but I doubt I will ever watch it again. You just need a man in a movie, in my opinion. The credits were clever in that the women were each likened to an animal that represented their personality and character. I found it a plus to this movie. If you want to see an example of a very strange movie, or if you want to see how horrible this world would be without men, give this movie a try."
5,1939 or 1999 Women are still the same!,This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Crawford is a winner at the man-stealer. The color segment for the fashion show is superb!
1,It was not my lucky day,"When I read the back cover I thought that the premise of the story would lend itself to an amusing read. I was prepared for the plot to be a bit on the lighterside with clever and witty dialogue. Unfortunately, light does not begin to describe the silly and at times mind numbing stupidity of both the characters and the plot. Witty was nowhere to be found. The book did have some scenes that were intended to be sensual, but even they were rendered ridiculous by the authors unceasing use of cutesy euphemisms. Before long I found myself skimming and skipping through the sillier passages, and then skimming and skipping through entire pages. The author's halfhearted attempt at intrigue was a classic case of way too little, way too late. All things considered, Luck may have been a Lady, but she was also a complete waste of my time."
4,Terrific 50-60's era sci-fi yarn,"Clarke has woven a suspenseful, edge-of your seat tale of a marrooned moon schooner. A fine example of speculative sci-fi predating our current knowledge of the moon surface. And calling it a rip-off of modern disaster flicks is wrong....it predates them!"
4,Excellent old scifi,"It is old sci, but in this case that is not a bad thing. The idea about sea of dust was quite possible in time of writing and moon is so unexplored still that it is not said that it would not be still possible. I've read this as a child and liked it then and like it now."
2,Blah.,"Major disappointment. I live in Salt Lake City, so I was hoping to remember every last minute of those 17 days, and I can't seem to find any video or DVD compilation with better coverage than this, so I'm stuck with it. As mentioned in other reviews, the best parts of opening and closing ceremonies are omitted, and each event gets glossed over very quickly. I would pay a lot of money for a complete compilation, if NBC would release one."
1,Pathethic,"The 1998 set didn't have enough complete performances, this is one tenth as good as the 1998 set. Do not buy this disc, it is a waste of money."
1,elementary disappointment,"when i read the description in amazon on this ""book"", i thought it would make a pragmatic addition to my small library on the inside passage, its history and peoples. this is nothing more than a non-detailed not-to-scale map with information printed on the back which anyone who has attended high school would know. this is not a book. at $2.00 i would not have written a negative review (my first), at $3.00 i would have felt cheated, at $10.36 i feel tricked and outraged."
5,Perfect for pluses!,The side elastic and the front pleats make for a great look as well as a fabulous feeling fit. A great purchase for plus-sized women! Will be purchasing more.
2,Probably wonderful pants but I ordered size 18 and was sent a size 24,"I checked size 18, which was the only size left, and got a 24. I cannot wear these but the hassle of returning them isn't worth it. Please correct the sizing info on this item."
4,Review,"Not just another diet book. It doesn't offer a quick fix, but gives you tips to get you started on a new lifestyle plan for eating. I liked that some recipes are included. I found the book helpful."
4,Entertaining,"On netflix one person wrote that this would only be interesting to some one that smoked. Pure ignorance. The cigarette is a chemical thing, historical thing and cultural thing. If you're interestid in the world we live in thing you will at least find this mildly interesting."
5,Stunning performance by an incredible artist,"Powerful, beautiful and stunning performance by an incredibly gifted young singer! Flawless and impressive talent with genuine compassion and charm. Definite 5-star -- absolutely the best!"
3,Figures Omited!,I am very disappointed in this product as all 7 figures which are necessary to get a complete picture of what is described in the text were omited with no explanation for this or indication of this in the prepurchase descriptions on the amazon page. I most definitely would not have purchased this item had I known this bit of information!
3,An Update?,"Read the reviews for the previous versions of this. I want to know what the changes are. Are they purely graphical with a few new gAmes, which are probably re-worked versions of previous games. My propblem with the 2000 version I have is that after a while, the various games are basically the same with different symbols, and the same pay-out schedule. On top of that, the machines are tight. You can go through your entire 100 credit allotment without hitting, especially on the higher top jackpot machines.On the other hand, the video poker is excellent and probably the most realistic, and the graphics are top-notch.For realism, Maaque does a great job copying IGT and Bally (Slots 2). The slots2 from Masque is perhaps the best, only one better is Phantom EFX Real DEal Slots and Video Poker which is an exact replica of real machines with the names changed slightly..."
3,Boring yet informative,"This book was pretty boring IMO. I am a big fan of Hendrix, but this book wasn't that great. It gave a lot of information but in a boring fashion. Uses explicit language. I hope a better book comes out."
3,Not as great as I thought,"I reviewed this product before, and had nothing but mostly glowing things to say. Unfortunately, time has not been as kind. When it works, it works great. Unfortunately, there have been a serious of problems with this box. Periodically it will just go offline. The remote cards claim to be able to connect, but no traffic goes through. Power-cycling the box is necessary. To be fair, this appears to be related to the version of the hardware, and the version of the firmware. My problems started when I ""upgraded"" to a new firmware drop. A later drop mitigated many of the problems, but I'm still left with the infrequent hang. There's at least one newer firmware drop that I haven't tried, but frankly, these interim drops should never have been released."
1,Go somwhere else,"I just went through two of these. I was on the configuration web page and I made some minor changes to the settings. The connection timed out and the WAP11 became unpingable. At the suggestion of tech support I rest the WAP. This resulted in wiping out the firmware. Uh-Oh. That right, Linksys doesn't have firmware available for the WAP11 v.2.2. The same thing happened to a second box with a different tech support person. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this box.BTW, I am a system administrator for a large university. I know how to configure hardware and software."
1,IPSec not supported well,I ended up having to return my Access Point because it would lock up soon after I established an Ipsec connection (through my VPN software). This happened even after I upgraded the firmware :(
4,John Rogers of Attleboro where are you?,"I read with great interest your review dated july 2002.The Tweaking you describe is just what my Wap 11 needs. It barely makes contact with the Wusb 11 at the other end of the house; approx. 90-100 Ft. and through at least 4-5 walls, closets and kitchen cabinets. Most of the time the link quality is 20-26% which is not enough to sustain a download although some surfing is possible. On good days we get to 33% but it reminds me of the days of B&W TV, rabbit ears and struggling to get Boston and Providence Stations while down the Cape. I was considering getting a second Wap 11 and placing it halfway between when I read about the 5x increase in power available provided you know SNMP code which I don't. Too bad you didn't leave your WEB site or e-mail in the review as I have found it impossible to find either. I may end up having to purchase that second unit after all."
2,it is not convenient,this access point is only able to receive signal from Linksys router with known MAC address and I tried to use it to receive signal from a WIFI network but it didn't work. there are much better types from other brands
3,Cheap Wireless,"The LinkSys WAP11 is very neat looking. Its performance however isn't as attractive.For the most part it works fine, however it need periodic power cyclings which make use exceedingly annoying.Useful if you don't have the money to spend on other products, but you pay for the cheapness with a few quirks."
1,Terrible,This product is very unreliable. I still have problems with mine. After calling the customer service line a couple of times I finally got through and talked with an agent for over an hour as he tried to figure out what was wrong with the product. He also told me that this happens a lot so I should call back when it happens again. Now my connection becomes unavailable about 3 to 6 times a day and I can only get it to work by unplugging the unit and restarting it. This product is terrible. It was a huge waste of money. Don't buy it.
2,"Easy set up, poor performance","The configuration was simple. Just left it as it was coming out of the box. I used the Linksys card in my portable W2K computer. The operational distance I get is the only problem I have with this product. If you are with 30 feet of the unit it works great, but if you move beyond the it becomes useless. Linksys does not officially support any other antennas that will provide better gain. Other companies do. So if you are thinking about sitting out at the pool, with this box in your office, forget it."
1,Unreliable installation makes this product useless,Threre are two ways to configure this device - one via the USB port and the other via the network port. Both methods failed.The USB drivers under Windows 2000 SP2 caused repeated blue screen of death. Even when Win2K booted up it reported that the driver had failed. The latest drivers from the website didn't help.The ethernet port (SNMP access) reported the WAP wasn't installed.Linksys' website doesn't help. So I am returning the unit today.
1,What a failure...,"I bought two of those and I could have written a 5 star review back then, like many people did. Out of the box, its a joy...but after less than 2 years, the failed one after the other and Linksys support said this was common hardward failure. A big waste of money."
5,Worked perfectly right out of the box,"After getting my Linksys cable modem and my Linksys router/switch to connect all the wired systems in the house together and onto the Internet, I bought this and a couple of USB wireless network adapters to connect the computers that weren't wired. This smoothly connected right to the router/switch and immediately began working, and in a few minutes I had customized it just the way I wanted."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I used this book as well as it's study companion from PPI2Pass and it is in NO way representative of the level of difficulty of the actual California Special Civil Engineer Examination. If you have NEVER taken a surveying course before in your life and you need a basic introduction to the elementary fundamentals of surveying, buy the study guide companion to this ""practice exam"" and not the practice exam itself. It's completely useless as a study guide for the actual exam."
1,complete junk,"I ordered three pair of these stands to hold my hsuresearch speakers (8""x8"" base, 20lbs). Of the six stands, two were entirely defective: stripped bolts, broken welds; the pillars are cheap, thin-walled aluminum. the bolts and spikes flimsy. The stands are unstable (base is too small) and poorly manufactured. i have no confidence that these stands will perform over time. In other words, spend a little more for better quality.Also, bear in mind the cost of returning these if you are not happy with them. After shipping (and possible ""restocking fee"" (yeah, right)), you might come out the other end spending more money returning them then just chucking them in a closet (as i did.)"
4,"Funny, obscure, little kickboxing anime.","This movie is a punch of good laughs. Back in my heyday, I used to watch this silly story about a mediocre female kickboxer named Ayane to get pumped up for my kickboxing bouts. Strange, I know. Definitely a cute story, although a little corny... alas the corny parts keep it fun and original."
3,Great Toy but lacking in quality,"We just brought this home today. The belt works great and very interactive. My son loved putting all on, and the flash light actually works. But I was disappointed with the vest and the helmet. The seam at the top of the vest was off with in a few hours, and so were the straps that held the helmet on. I could have bought those things at the dollar store and received the same quality. But the belt and other accesories are great. I am not sure you get the quality you want for the money."
1,what do you mean it's not the Corelle I know?,"This was misleading....seeing that it was Corelle I didn't read the description any further, assuming it would be that glass-type product. Lo and behold these metal enameled bowls appear. A)they;re heavy B) they can't be used in the microwave C) there's nothing on the packaging that says they can used in the oven D)if that's ""pink"" then I'm a supermodel."
5,Amazing,"This is the book I wish I'd had many years ago, when I started reading Crowley. Excellently put together. I highly recommend this book! I couldn't put it down!"
5,"Very fast, very easy installation",I get about 8MB on my laptop which has a Belkin wireless Pre-N adapter. No weak spots or loss of connection throughout my 2500 sq ft home. I have even walked around the block and did not lose connection to this router (which also means you better use encryption). Very satisfied.
1,Plastic sole scuffs floors,"This comment is on the quality of the product not the seller-I purchased these thinking I was getting the same quality item Totes offered in the past. They have the same upper BUT the sole is now a cheap plastic that is hard to walk on with the excessive padded ""arch support"" not necessary in a slipper. Totes must have thought this was an upgrade, but it definitely is not. Also scuffs wood & tile."
3,Research Regarding Word Association,"This is a technical, bland research paper comparing word association between normal and insane persons.Written in 1911, the terminology is somewhat different from today, particularly the use of the word ""insane"" in reference to the mentally ill. Major depression is apparently called ""melancholy.""The paper begins with a description of the word association technique, and it then gives examples and tables (which can be hard to figure out on the Kindle.)If you are interested in early research into mental illness, you might be interested. (I was interested.) Otherwise, don't even look."
3,stiff bristles,"Bristles were hard and stiff, but 3 months later they got softer, I would recommend getting like 3 since they're so cheap."
4,Enjoyable,Held my interest from the very beginning. I recommended this book to my friends. I have since passed this book on for others to read and enjoy.
3,Good characters but lacking in mystery,"This is the first book of this series I have written. I thought the characters were interesting and well developed. I enjoyed the interaction between them and felt they did come to ""life"". I also enjoyed the tidbits about tea and cooking. However, I felt the mystery story line was an after thought. At times I felt the mystery had been inserted into the book after the book had been completed. There was no real meat to the mystery. I would have liked more detail regarding the investigation. The setting and characters were very detailed but the plot regarding the mystery and clues into the investigation were lacking. I have not decided whether I will read another in this series. I would love to know more about the characters but the mystery aspect left me wanting."
3,Very Good,"This was my first book to read by Laura Childs. It was a very easy read, interesting and exciting. I could not stop turning the pages as I was intrigued to figure out who was the murderer as well as to see what Haley was going to be whipping up in the kitchen. I will read more Laura Childs books in the future."
1,Lost their own sound,"I'm glad i listened to samples before buying this pathetic album. Is not as if we have enough want-to-be so called metal-rap bands who all sound the exact same. Orgy was an awesome band when they had the Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson like sound and i could name that tune in two notes. This album was just a disappointment and a 90 degree turn in the wrong direction."
2,I agree,"the band has almost left what made them unique and cool to listen too.the drums,gutar,the dark sounding melodys are all but gone this is something I didnt expect from orgy and when it took so long,its not there best."
4,Orgy is back with an attitude,"I didn't expect anything spectacular from Orgy after Vapor Transmission. Candyass is a very difficult album to beat. However, with a new label, and improved writing style, orgy has certainly beaten Vapor Transmission. I suspect it'll grow on the listener, just like Canyass did.Songs like ""Make Up Your Mind"" and ""Can't Take This"" are quite radio-friendly. I highly recomend buying this comeback effort."
1,Orgy died,"I enjoyed Candyass and VP and was excited to hear they put out a new CD.......yeah. Well, the new record is terrible. Musically, they have turned into another nu-metal band. Lyrically, they have turned into another nu-metal band. Jay Gorden writes cliche' lyrics that are not clever and the rest of the band plays mediocre music. They have lost their uniqueness.Then again, some people seem to really like this record. If you enjoy bands like Linkin Park, new Korn, Staind, and bland nu-metal bands, this is the record for you."
1,Punk Static Dissapointment,"To begin I must say that I liked Candyass and deeply enjoyed Vapor Transmission. And (not to seem like I'm comparing this album to those cd's) Punk Static Paranoia for an Orgy fan such as my self was a huge let-down. It has been four years since the last album and when they do return, they are singing colorless, boring, and poorly written songs. The sound is different, something similar to Linkin Park, but still with the Orgy/synth-pop-rock sound. The new style isn't that bad, but it doesn't feel genuine at times (and it ends up sounding silly). Don't waste time with this cd unless you are a big fan. The best thing about the new Orgy cd is that it was released, making Orgy fans hopeful for future releases/tours. Sorry Orgy, maybe next time.Support your FavoritesThank You"
2,Larry's Depressed,"Seems McMurtry, after producing some ponderous epics, like Lonesome Dove, has declined to penning quick, non-fiction little tomes to gin a few bucks for his wallet. Don't get me wrong, McMurtry is one of my favorite authors, but Driving America and his biography of Crazy Horse, just don't come up to his earlier standards. Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen nearly slips into the catetory with Driving and Crazy, and only some frequent good passages helps McMurty keep his nose above the water line. Driving and Crazy Horse are thin soup for the price. I thought McMurty's Driving would be a great sequel to Michael Paterniti's Driving Mr. Albert. Not so. Paterniti drives a five-speed stick with 300 horsepower by comparision."
2,Off the Roads,"The moment McMurtry gets ""on the road"" his lack of passion or even interest in the roads that he traverses becomes obvious. ""ROADS"" is a haphazard mutt of a book: it is part memoir, part book review, and part history of America. He does not stop for anything, except the occasional burrito at a gas station or night at a Holiday Inn. Since he is not exploring, the scenes are long, usually tiring commentaries about events that have happened in the towns that he passes at seventy miles per hour. McMurtry's love for the plains occasionally shines through, but ROADS is otherwise lacking in the perfect storytelling that made him famous."
3,Roads to nowhere,"Proof that a famous writer can get published just about anything. McMurtry likes to travel the big interstates, especially those of the midwest, where he likes the light. He ""chronicles"" a dozen trips he took on the I-10, 40, 35, 70, 80 and a few others - telling little of what he sees (what's there to see on the interstates?). He likes to chat about certain favorite writers as he passes through sections they are associated with, but even here he doesn't say much. One wonders why he's doing all this - much of the time it doesn't seem like he's having much fun. Considering the stature of this usually very fine writer, this book is a big disappointment."
4,Pretty good pepper mill,"Very, very pretty on my kitchen counter and works good too. It's easy to see when to refill and it grinds really fine or coarse with the adjustment knob on top. Reason why i didn't give five stars is because the adjustment loosens up from time to time from use."
2,Was great...until if fell apart upon refill,"I liked the item for the first month, as the crank and adjustment worked great. I refilled it, however, and it jammed a few uses later and fell apart when I tried to repair the jam and all the little pieces are near impossible to put back together in order.There's no manual or diagram to help and it's two weeks beyond the ""return window.""Not recommended."
4,Decision just take it,This book was given to me during an meeting and six thinking hats represent each of the thinking styles we employ when problem solving or generating new ideas and concepts.Good one for decision makers.[...]
4,Very fun story that will actually take you to Byzantium,"No spoilers.I'll have to agree with another reviewer here who noted that the immediate flaw in this novel is that there is little introduction or background given about the protagonist, Demetrios, until about a quarter of the way into the book. Having said that (and overlooking it because you eventually find out about him), this is definitely a book I recommend.Although I began to suspect who the Emperor's true enemy was before it was revealed, even that, which is something that I usually hate when reading a mystery, didn't take away from the quality of the story. Harper, with ease, immerses the reader into eleventh century Byzantine society to the point where you almost believe you are reading these events unfold in the present, right outside your window.I fully recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and who wants to be transported into their story."
1,not worth the money,"The movie is only twenty minutes long. This is totally not worth the money, its just a gimmick to promote sales for HTTYD."
5,too short,"this movie was cute,but it was way to short.this is to much money for it to be as short as it was."
4,"Too Short, Bring on a HTTYD2","This is a very short movie with a Christmas theme, wouldn't be surprised to see it on TV next holiday season. For those of you who loved the original this is a small fix, bring on a sequel!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"I could tell right out of the package these weren't high quality batteries, they simply feel light and cheap. They did work for my flashlight but there life cycle is pretty short.On the other hand they didn't cost much so, yes, it's another case of ""You get what you pay for"""
5,Ami!!!!,"i absolutley love ami suzuki,then and nowher style(music,looks) have changes DRASTICALLY!!but i still LOVE her old stuffthis is an awsome songone of my favorites from hercan someone put up the single""tsuyoi kizuna""please?!!!!!?"
5,The complete George A. Romero story-Kudos to Paul R. Gagne,"This book is the definative story of the films of George A. Romero. In fact, it's the only book that's soley dedicated to his films. Gagne recounts Romero's humble beginings at Image Ten Inc. working with John Russo, Bill Hinzman, and Russ Streiner. He concludes with Romero's production and writing credits for 'Tales from the Darkside'(The book was published in 1987). The book is very well written, researched, and contains information not published elsewhere. Gagne's writing-style is straight-forward and insightful. Obviously, Gagne is a fan and writes with great care and affinity. This is a magnificent book and is a must for all George A. Romero fans."
1,you know it's a bad sign...,"...when the cover for the mp3 album says ""David Boone.""These are re-recordings for a no-name label. Consider buying only if you can't find originals, and you really love this artist."
5,Another terrific read from a very talented author!,"Jane Porter is an author with amazing talent and THE SHEIKH'S WIFE is just another testament to this fact. Full of riveting emotions and page-turning, bone-melting passion, readers will not soon forget such a wonderful story.THE SHEIKH'S WIFE takes the drama of romance, arresting characterization, and sizzling sexual tension to new heights for this sub-genre. Ms. Porter's writing style is crystal clear and smooth as silk. The plot was intriguing and certainly full of twists which can leave the reader guessing... and feeling pleasantly surprised too.For those who enjoy stories about alpha males, this book will force you to put life on hold until you've reached the very last page... and then you'll want to start reading it all over again. It's that good! Don't miss it."
2,The Sheikh's wife is back...in his bed!,"Sheikh Kahlil al-Assad hasn't forgiven Bryn for abandoning her wedding vows. Then he discovers that he's also missed out on the first years of his son's life. Kahlil decides to take revenge.Bryn didn't realize - they are still husband and wife! She knows she can't deny Ben the daddy's he's been asking for. So she agrees to return to Kahlil's desert kingdom. There she finds herself consigned to the harem quarters, where she must prepare for being taken back...into the Sheikh's bed!"
5,Revamping,"Conversion to judaism is never an easy thing. Unfortunatelly, orthodox rabbis tend to dismotivate it and often create barriers to one who is trying to join our people. This book shows people that conversion isn't an impossible thing, although difficult and shows what people have been through when dealing with this factor.To be absolutelly perfect, this book could contain a certain Orthodox Rabbis Directory who acepts dealing with such a delicate matter or, at least, tell how to aproach an orthodox rabbi to discuss this. Anyways, I really recommend the book to whomever is considering conversion.I would like to thank Rabbi Marc D. Angel for writing this book. It gave us help and hope."
2,Where Are the Actual Men?,A book in which men are poorly considered. Either they are female copies (Spinel) or male dominants (Realgar). Nothing in between. No real sex either to reproduce but a kind of parthenogenesis. A part of what being human is about denied for an idealistic female construction leading to a dull life. I doubt any civilization would ever survive as described on Shora. All those flaws make the story pretty naive and the book rather boring. I didn't adhere to any character and plodded on to finish it.
1,Too Many Jesuses,Josephus records the names and stories of at least 23 Jesii between 50 BCE and 50 CE. What on earth in any way indicates that this one is your mythical savior?
3,Quite interesting..,"I think this video is pretty interesting and it is quite odd the grouping of all these names. It's also odd how the people in the warehouse brush it off like there's no chance it could possibly be Jesus. Also odd how the book of Phillip isn't included in the bible..****************!!!!SPOILER!!!!*************************But, for them to say that the one woman's remains in there HAD to be married to the Jesus in the tomb is kind of absurd. The woman could have been married to any of the men whose remains were in that tomb and it could also POSSIBLY be Jesus' wife. You know how you solve that? Do DNA tests on the child's bone box found! Why was that not done? or not covered in the movie?*********End Spoiler********************Favorite line in the movie: ""1,000,000% certainty, that's ALL we needed""A blind woman was THAT certain that was the location of the tomb they were looking for. Yes, a blind woman. Was she right? Guess you'll have to watch..."
2,waste of money,This was a giant waste of money. To much work! I would not recommend to anyone very poor quality too!
2,Don't buy!,"Not a good product at all. Horrible design, flimsy. Only used it like 4 times and it broke. Oh well..."
2,Wish I had not bought this,"My friend had bought the Saladacco spiral slicer, NOT Joyce Chen's and she loved it. I thought I was purchasing that also, but got this product instead. My husband and I both find it very difficult to manage. Forget the fact that the veggies have to be cut to certain lengths, etc. The main thing is that the teeth that cut the veggies to make them into thin angel hair ""pasta"" only make an impression in the zucchini, and cut them rather thick. The plastic housing is difficult to get apart, and after once in the dishwasher, there was rust on the metal pieces. I wish I had not bought this and only hope I can get my money back so I can buy the one that works!"
2,"Awesome while it lasted, but it didn't last!","This spiral slicer is just what I had hoped it would be when I got it. Raw zucchini noodles are fantastic & filling. This tool will certainly help me reach my goals in 2012 of eating more veggies! You do have to cut your veggies to size to fit in the slicer. I can't speak to how long this slicer will last, since I just got this for Christmas. But the price is right on Amazon compared to other ""Raw"" sites.I'm back to update my review, as my slicer has broken! After about 5-6 uses the plastic that holds the blade in place has crumbled away! This slicer is useless now :( I'm looking for a better quality replacement hopefully in stainless!"
4,Very Satisfied.,"This spiral slicer is amazing. I have gotten to use it a few time now and each time I am more and more amazed with how easy it is to use.I use it mostly to make zucchini pasta and it works quite well for that. I haven't really used it for anything else yet, but really look forward to trying new things with it.The only complaint I have is that it is kinda hard to clean the blades. Other than that, it's great.I highly recommend it."
2,makes great potato nests,"I bought this at a kitchen boutique and paid $30. Wow, that was not a good move.... It is cheaply made and looks like it will probably fall apart shortly. And what happens when the blades get dull ????Its 1 redeeming feature is that it will make very thin potato strands which can be deep fried into tasty potato nests.... its an easy and interestingaddition to a plate of fried chicken or barbeque...We tried to make potato chips and they were a disaster... either way too thin or they came out in a really odd shape...I would suggest one of the other non plastic models .... and I learned it pays to do your homework on any product and not go for the impulse buy."
2,"Made Mush, Not Noodles :(","This turned my squash into mush, not pasta noodles. If you are looking to make pasta out of your veggies, this is not for you. I did get an arm work out trying to use this, but I am really kicking myself for not spending the extra $$$ and getting one that does a better job :("
3,A little quirky,"After eating zucchini in a restaurant that resembled spaghetti, I bought the spiral slicer. Cons - continual force while rotating the knob is required making the process a bit of a workout. The resulting strands of vegetable is more like angel hair than spaghetti. The dimensions of the veggie to be sliced is particular (it can't be any longer than about 5 inches and really needs to be at least 3 inches in diameter). There is always a bit of veg leftover (1 to 2 eights of an inch) that cannot be spiraled. Also, the carrots I processed left a permanent stain on the white plastic.It just seems to be inefficient - it takes many chunks of veg to make a satisfying amount. And, each time a new veg is processed, that's opening the top, skewering the veg, emptying out the hopper, and doing another little 'workout'. It's kind of a hassle!I'm still on the hunt for something that will duplicate that side dish I had out!"
1,Pretty useless kit !,"The kit comes with rechargable batteries(which are not Fuji brand, they are some junk brand, they don't hold charge even for 1/4 the time as 1700 mah fuji ones that came with the camera) and a charger(which is junk, much worse than the original charger that comes with the camera, takes 10 hrs).The case for camera is good to carry your camera around and is the only worhtwhile thing in this, but doesn't have any space to store extra card/batteries.The tripod stand iincluded is another junk, I haven't used it for a single picture to date.All in all it was just a marketing gimmick by Fuji to sell the camera by including all this free with camera. Not worth more than $10 in my opinion !"
3,Camara pictures are great,The information with the camara use is where I am finding the most difficult. I will probably go on line to talk with a represenative and have them step me through my problems.The order and delivery service were excellent.
5,an american obsession,"With insight and humor, Jennifer Terry chronicles the past two centuries' efforts by science and society to classify and adjudicate our myriad ways to experience love, desire, and pleasure. An important book that raises many new questions and casts new light on the old ones."
1,he is back and wack,"this ,ovie sucks. really... it is so bad that it is funny to whatch. the fighting is bad (it looks like olivier is stressed when he fights.) the dorector is weak (how come every movie that jalal make is worse then the last?) dont buy this, dont rent it, make sure u have second thoughts if it goes on cable"
4,Great price but missing something,"I was amazed at the price of this book, which was considerably cheaper than the UNLV bookstore. However, there is a reason. It does not come with the accompanying paperback that the UNLV bookstore version did. Luckily my class did not require reading in the paperback (it had vignettes) but if I had needed it I would have been in trouble."
2,Not effective,"This peeler certainly did not perform up to expectations. I had several pounds of ripe peaches to peel and this peeler just got stuck in the flesh and did not peel nicely. The teeth dug in to the soft flesh and tore out huge hunks. What a waste of nice organic fruit. I attempted to peel two different peaches, then gave up and went back to a simple paring knife."
5,Rocks,"This is how fitness DVDs should be, variety, tough exercises simple and precise instruction, and most of all fun. Meghan comes across as a knowledgeable fitness expert. The first workout I did nearly killed me, but I keep going back for more and my body is getting use to the workout, but there are many routines which I have yet to try. Here is to happy workouts and a smaller waist!"
4,Great suite,"This software suite combines the Utilities, Antivirus, cleansweep and the firewall protection all together. Firewalls are cruical in today's world and the system works makes your OS work better. And this works with all of the windows systems."
1,"Good info, hard to read format","I had to use the book for a Political Science project in college, and I found it to be completely boring and hard to read. The chapters and the information contained within each does not flow very well and is very confusing. I attend the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I found this book to be a chore to read and repetitive. To make the best of this book, just read the bold and larger titles and don't waste your time reading the monotonous details."
1,Didn't work in my house!,"I always try to read the reviews before I make a purchase. In this case...I'm afraid to think of how bad the flea infestions were in some of these houses. Happily...I must not have too many because I nothing on my sticky paper. I was disappointed in the ""UV"" light source because that bulb looked like it would fit an old fashion night light. I was not impressed with this product in the least bit."
3,flea trap refill 2,"this trap is ok, but not as effective as the other one I purchased.Springstar S103 Flea Trap Capture Pads - 3 Pads Per Box"
1,Not worth the money,"These are just three pieces of sticky paper. They charge them at more than $6. That's robbery. If I know this, I won't buy them. If they claim it as a pad, they should at least make it like a pad, not just sticky paper."
3,Not much practical and useful information,"I thought that this was probably a terrific book for a young girl dreaming of owning her own horse, but felt that it had very little practical and useful information for the horse owner, especially for an inexperience first-time owner. I have never been able to use it as a reference when I had a problem and find the information I needed."
4,Well worth watching,"Great watch, keeps you guessing all the way. Bill Nighy is wonderful as ever. A film you could easily watch again."
4,Four and a half stars,"The film was really good. Stylish and fun and intelligent, understated and soft-spoken but it didn't lose my attention even for a moment so extremely well-edited, too. You'll see no car chase or sex scene; the film's a talker. It's slow, but, then, I like a man with a slow hand..."
2,lousy ending after all that,"a long road of story with a weak and disappointing pay off, and none really to speak of. bill nigh is too old for the role, should be played by daniel craig re age range. david hare some good dialogue and sparks fly but the final moments/decisions let the viewer down with a upper crust boring thump. too bad. has/had promise. but the the story doesn't deliver. in the end, rather dated despite the veneer of current, albeit 2008, headlines. a poor man's james bond without the action!"
3,LOOKS LIKE A MADE FOR BRITISH TV MOVIE,"WELL ACTED, BUT QUITE SLOW AND TEDIOUS. THE AMAZON PAGE FOR THIS MOVE HAD IT RATED AS 5 STARS, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MOVIE THE CRITC WAS WATCHING, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS THIS ONE.AS MENTIONED ABOVE IT HAD A BRITISH TV LOOK TO IT."
2,Anti-American agit-prop,"Another of those deadly dull pieces in which characters speak in hushed tones about ""reports"" of evil prime ministers and those dreadful Americans. The script plods on in a predictable way -- and even the enchanting Rachel Weisz can't enliven it."
2,jigsaw puzzle book,"My 5-year-old granddaughter loves working jig saw puzzles. I already have one beautiful book with fairies that she's done a thousand times, so I thought I'd get her another one. The Alice in Wonderland book I bought was very disappointing. Pieces were missing in one of the puzzles, and the pictures are very ""bland."" She looked at it and went back to the fairy puzzles."
3,Ok,"Not the best, but will work in a pinch! I felt it made me have more frizz than a regular diffuser."
5,Magnificent,Not much more to say the paintings are gorgeous the large scale and quality of the paper a fitting surrounding and the text is actually interesting ( which is saying something for a uniform book ). All power to the publishers and a superb adornment to a Napoleoninc library
3,Cruising?,"This movie tells how to get partially ready and for that it is useful. Would have liked to see more sailing, of which I know they have done alot. It does what the title says."
2,Not for clinical use,"While you can hear very well with this, however the metal extensions to the ears tend to twist! So while you are wearing this stethoscope in your ears and you move the bevel to listen to your patient, the metal extensions twist toward your face and pull the earpieces from your ears! I am very disappointed in this product. Also, the Littmann tag DOES NOT FIT this stethoscope. Giving two stars since you can hear well when you are able to use one hand to hold the earpieces in place. Fine for home use."
1,BEWARE everybody!!,"I bought this stethoscope also thinking that it was LITTMANN but IT'S NOT!!! and the one the send you is not a good one. I mean, it let you hear but is REALLY unconfortable and heavy. I agree that this advertisement is deceptive!!!! I dont recommend it to anyone. IT IS NOT A LITTMANN STETHOSCOPE, please read this."
5,Reminds you of the true meaning of Christmas!!!,This book contains short stories about different people encountered by the author. Most are very simple people and Sibley shows you Christmas and what these people consider blessings through their eyes.
3,A solid night light..,Would have given it 4 stars but the bulb burnt out after on 2 months. Other than replacing the bulb this is a sure bet.
5,Perfect for any room,"What a Great value! Good for any room. Highly recommend for nursery, bathroom, guest room or hallway. Will probably buy more."
4,Pebl U6 just fine if you are Polish,Works as advertised - after struggling for a few hour to change the installed regional language from Polish cyrilic (!!!) @#$%^&* to English. Since one has to use menus and sub-menus to reach the correct function it was a real challenge. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
1,Interesting but misleading,"While the flow of the novel was good and the writing well done, I was disappointed to read her assassination of Thomas Jefferson's character by stating he was the father of Sally Hemming's child ""Tom"". This information was originally believed to be true based on early DNA testing but later the testing was found to be flawed and additional testing proved ""Thomas Jefferson"" was not the father, it was likely another member of the Jefferson family was the father of Sally Hemming's child. In that this information was available prior to the writing of this book is either a blatant disregard for the true or poor research. While Jefferson was not the father of Sally Hemming's child it was clear that Jefferson thought highly of Sally Hemming and any relationship they had would be based on mutual feelings and not on subordination. While this misinformation was dishearting it gives rise to the questioning of other representations in the book."
1,Patriot Hearts a Novel of the Founding Mothers,"I haven't finished reading this book, but wanted to voice my objection to the comment about Thomas Jefferson being a benevolent slave owner. Monticello ""operated on carefully callibrated brutality."" Read the article in the October 2012 Smithsonian Magazine: [...]"
3,the best spider man rip off of all time,"this is a spider man rip off but with a far darker tone.dan akroyd plays a serious cop whose trying to get his man.he doesnt do very well and should stick to comedy.kids will get scared.all the money was devoted to the monster in this one and not anything else.the monster is a geek who is enduring a really slow metamorphisis into a man sized spider.its the best spider man rip offive ever seen.there are some parts with nasty spider stuff,so the queasy should look away.there are no hot chicks just some priss the geek pines over all the time.it will probably get a bad rap,but its good.this is the best dan akroyd film but thats because all hisfilms suck.the man spider guy is really neat.id even watch a sequel."
1,Campy creature B movie,"With respect to other reviews it should be noted that this film is very cheesy. It bills itself as a Terrifying Thriller Horror but I can only think of one shot in the film intended to scare. It plays more like a long episode of the Monsters! television show. The plot is a mix of the Jeff Goldblum ""The Fly"" and the spiderman comic books.There were parts where the execution was fun and interesting but more often than not I felt I had seen it all before ... in better movies. I had hopes for Akroyd due to his work in previous Horror/Comedies and even a few dramatic performances. Unfortunately, he and all the other actors play it for high drama. Also, the title ""Earth vs. the Spider"" is a misnomer as Earth for the most part never knows there even is a spider. The film focuses on four or five people and all the rest are just bit parts."
4,Which Archive?,"This is a carefully - and mostly successfully - plotted book. The Archivist tells three interrelated stories. Proud and stubborn characters must yield to each other to find meaning. The entire project is very ambitious.Oddly, the book makes the same impression on me as the later poetry of T.S. Eliot it references...grave profundity and wholesale disapproval of human emotions. Perhaps the dour, ungainly Matthias is supposed to be an echo of Eliot. He is flanked by two wild women, the mad wife (and not a new take on the mad wife, unfortunately) and the sexy scholar.The reader is privy to Mad Wife's diary, an archive that runs parallel to the collection of letters Matthias guards. Oh, but I won't go on summarizing; this book made an impression on me and I recommend it though I can't quite say whether I liked it or not."
5,"Haunting, human and humble","Sometimes a book and its essence stays with you, colors your perception of the world and subtlety alters your thought processes. This was one such book for me. I picked it up haphazardly out of my father's library needing something to carry me through the long flight home . . . it made me wish the flight was even longer. The inexorable march of human drama across the pages was addicting, the obsession with the holocaust, the ever widening whirlpool of depression and both the fragility and awe-inspiring strength of human love are pieces of this beautiful work that has stayed with me for a long, long time."
4,"No, no it's not by ""Edda Saemunder""","First of all, I really like this book, and am saddened that it's currently out of print. Some have expressed some criticism with the ""Christianization"" of the material, particularly in some of the illustrations, but it still is a favorite.Sombody should explain to these knuckleheads at Amazon that the title of the book is indeed ""the Elder or Poetic Edda""; however, it is attributed (mistakenly) to an Icelandic bishop named Saemendur; Saemunder's first name is not Edda. The actual author is unknown. Olive Bray is the translator.Lavrans Reimer-MllerCambridge MAUSA"
1,Terrible,"I only picked this movie because it was more or less about Facebook, which I had just joined so was curious. Also because it was free and ""experimental"". But it was inane, and confusing. I thought it would never end; I endured it--hoping that something interesting would happen--but it didn't. A waste of time."
5,MORE!,This was a really cool Idea! I really like that the story was so different than typical hollywood drivel. The characters were awesome. Thanks for the great laughs.
2,"Stupid, but funny","This movie was so stupid and a little slow...maybe because I am older (46). I would not watch again, however, I did laugh out loud several times."
4,very entertaining,"This was my first experience with Amazon Studios and I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals were good enough to not be a distraction to the viewers, only needing a little polish to make it to the big screen. I thought the acting was ok, but Mo Bu's character could use some work. Overall, the writing was done very well. Jessica and Owen were nicely characterized, Pants and Rishi a little less. Mo Bu needs to be filled out a little more. Why was she wearing the tracker? I really enjoyed this and will watch more of Amazon Studios productions."
4,Good Watch,I really en joyed this movie more than I expected. It was fun and really timely with everyone meeting on facebook. Liked the characters and the interaction. If you want to watch something entertaining give it a go.
4,"I liked it, It was a good ""B"" movie","i did enjoy this little movie. I think the topic is right on with what is happening to this generation. Love thme chick that drove and Pants... Riech was a bit much but if you slowed him down a bit and give him time to actually make the hook ups etc, I liked his story line. And hey, the guy gets the imaginary girl. :O This isn't some huge big budget release, but what they were working for it was okay. 1 more thing, the main dude was such a pacifist woos that I really didn't think he deserved her. Should give him some minor act of courage to redeem him."
4,Good movie!,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I think it has the potential to become something really good! I laughed, I was worried, I liked the characters. I wasn't sure if it was going for a dark comedy scheme or not, but it could! I definitely think the musical soundtrack could use a little work-- there are a lot of dead spots with no noise that could be filled in with appropriate music. And some of the music that is in there is a little off for the scene. But other than that, I thought it was very clever and with a little work, I would probably go see it :)"
2,Sorry...not this time,"I made it to exactly 20:57 before I decided I'd had quite enough. I don't have a problem with low-budget, but this was just a little too silly to hold my attention. Maybe next time."
1,Not worth it,"Meade makes good telescopes, but this isn't one of them.We got ours for free, but after using it for a couple nights, realize even that was too much.This telescope doesn't show much in the way of detail. You can see the moon, unless it's moist out, then the optics (ours at least) fogged over. We were hard-pressed to find Jupiter and the Galilean moons.If you're in the market for a good entry level telescope, stay away from this. I'd recommend a Celestron FirstScope, or Edmund Scientific Astroscan. The FirstScope is less money and gives a much better image. The Astroscan, while more expensive, is the most user friendly telescope we've used and has phenomenal imaging."
4,An inexpensive way to see the stars!,"I was able to see so many great details of our solar system when I got this telescope. Sometime in the future I might upgrade to a really nice one, but this one is perfect for my wife and I to look at the moon together. It's a nice rich color too. It looks great sitting in our house next to the window. I think with the great price Amazon sells it for it would make a great gift."
2,Not quite as described.,"""Entirely freestanding, no bolts, no screws!""Not quite. It won't even stay up unless you prop it up against a wall, for crying out loud! At least once it's holding a bike or two it stands up by itself... in a wobbly kind of way. A small child could very easily destabilize it and tip it over, with potentially disastrous consequences.Another fairly major flaw of this rack is that the hooks holding the bike frame are not sturdy and bend easily.Considering its very low price, it's relatively acceptable as long as you're willing to bolt it to the wall; just don't expect to receive a rack that even remotely resembles the description made on the Amazon page."
3,Arrive unfunctional,"This rack seems like it'd be a good idea. I bought it to free up some space inside my apartment. However, when I received the rack, I was unable to fit the pieces together.I called the customer support people at Racor and they were very friendly. They are going to ship out a new piece for the middle which should fit.If this works, it'll be a nice rack. Mine's not scraped up like the other reviews. However, I have yet to see if this will work."
1,This rack is not worth your time.,"This rack leaves a lot to be desired.It sways considerably, and unless the top bar is perfectly level to the ground (which most bikes are not), the bikes can move (i.e. you don't want anything of value like a nice car to be beside/underneath this rack).Keep looking."
4,Not Quite Freestanding,"I received the order promptly as promised from Amazon. Assembly was quick and connects with four loosely fitting pieces plus the four twisting arm hangers. The stand leans due to construction of the frame pieces. However, I did not bolt to the wall, instead I wedged a small piece of rebar under the frontend of the base to keep the stand firmly against the wall. That way when ever I remove either bike the stand remains against the wall. It appears to do the job. Also, I wrapped the plastic arm hangers with pipe foam tubing so that the (brake and gear)cables running under the bike frame would not get smashed with the weight of the bike. Good deal for the price."
4,Bulky. Nothing fancy. But does what it's supposed to.,"If you really care about aesthetics, this won't be installed in a highly-visible spot. But it's about as functional as a stand gets. There are adjustments you can make on the stands 'arms' depending on the slant of the top bar on the bike, so that's helpful. Is it deceptive to call it gravity... freestanding? I suppose, but anyone that actually looks at the picture or does some common sense research can see that you need a wall to prop this against. There is also an option to anchor it to the wall, but I've gone so far without doing so. It's not much of a space-saver - it does keep you from leaning one bike against the other in a precarious spot, which is what I needed both to save some space and to keep either bike away from harm. Also nice to work on a bike more at eye-level sometimes and avoid buying a workstand for easy fixes.It's not pretty, but it does the trick. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a good & cheap option."
1,"Contrary to the claim made, this is not freestanding.","As a strong fan of Amazon Prime, I was pleased to see this heavy item show up without shipping charges. Unfortunately, this was a waste of time for us; it requires being installed at a wall, with a screw supplied to secure it to that wall. Thus, it is not freestanding. Therefore, it only will work easily for you if you are one of those lucky persons who needs to reduce garage clutter, but nonetheless has free wall space the width of a bike, with door clearance."
4,Bike Rack,I bought two of these bike racks and they both work very well. There is only one hole at the top for mounting to a wall. It would be nice if there was a second hole in the frame for mounting against the wall.
4,Easy to assemble and use bike rack,"This is a great bike rack, and it is very stable, you just have to be sure to put it together correctly. If you put the bottom piece on wrong, it won't be stable; it's also not a ""freestanding"" rack, meaning it does need to be leaning up against a wall, you can just set it in the middle of the room.The rack went together in about 5 minutes, and has held our two road bikes just fine. It sits right on the wall, which was great for us because we were looking for a way to store our bikes in our small apartment. We've had our bikes on this rack nearly a month now, and there hasn't been anything that would cause me to worry.The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because the joint between the upper two pieces on my rack is a bit loose, and I would like it to be a bit tighter, but I think some shelf liner wrapped around the inside will fix it just fine."
1,Not sure if it's packaging of the product is used.,"The product arrived promptly with rather poor packaging that is obvious has been opened before and repackaged using packaging tape. Majority of the hooks look okay and still in plastic wrap but the metal base and support look weathered with several dents and severe scratches that I am not sure what to think of, either they have sold me a used product without letting me know or this item has fell out of UPS truck several times during transit."
4,A-quality product,"I have this in my dorm for my two bikes, and i really can use all the room i can get in here. It works like a charm, and it has been a solid investment!"
4,Racor bike rack,Was quite skeptical with so many negative reviews. Ordered it Monday evening and received it Wednesday afternoon. I put the rack together within 5mins. I have 2 road bikes on it at the moment. The only problem I found about ts rack is that if you do not have weights holding the rack down or bikes holding It down it leans towards th ball and thus could scratch up your wall. However it does come with a mount to screw into the wall. I also am skeptical with the arms that hold the bike. I wonder how long it will sat and if it will brekdown over the years. Oerall i am quite pleased with taking a gamble on this rack. For $51 shipped it is much cheaper than the 120 racks out there.
5,Works as described,"Came with a broken arm, but company quickly replaced it. Works great for a male and female bike. Easy to assemble, and holding bikes currently without being screwed into a wall."
5,Berkeley Breathed,"Great book from a great author, you will not be disappointed if you are a Berkeley Breathed fan."
5,"Influential Band, Influential Book",This book is a must have for all Floyd fans. Has all the best tunes from the album.
4,Not for novices,"This is a great book for experienced Grand Canyon hikers. It opens up some very interesting new options for long hikes in the Canyon. However these hikes are long, tough and rarely anywhere near a trail. Oh by the way, also very beautiful and peaceful. Novices following them stand a good chance of getting lost or hurt. The hiking directions are general not specific."
1,NOT FOR BEGGINERS,"This book is a big waste of time and money just like many other Maya books. I have bought and read over 5 Maya books geared towards begginers and none of them including this one is helpful. They have many great tutorials, but all the directions are very hard to understand because they leave alot of missing information out. Its like they expect you to really know the software in and out to study their beginner books series.My advice for begginners is to use a less demanding program. Many people who use Maya are pros and thats not to say you won't be either. But unless you go to school, these books in my opionion are worthless. Even though the tutorials are made by people who have big names in the CGI industry, doesn't mean they have the teaching skills to get us small people going.I recommend Lightwave, because the book, Inside Lightwave 8 taught me in a breeze how to ge up and running fast-"
4,Great Product,"Found relief from joint pain and swelling. Am off all anti-inflammatory medications now and still have same level of comfort. Not to say I am pain free, but equally comfortable with FLEXNOW."
2,No Discernible Improvement,I tried one bottle of Flexnow Joint Formula and did not notice any improvement in my knee discomfort. My feeling is that it's another joint product that is not worth using.
2,not worth it,I purchsed this item thinking it would be a good foundation for a full coverage makeup. I would not recommend this product for purchase. The makeup looks way to noticable which is what I try & avoid. You are better off buying a better store brand for full coverage.
4,Worked beautifully,I used this make up for a wedding. It'a a little thicker so I had better coverage to hide my freckles. It worked out beautifully.
1,I hadn't received my CD yet,"I cannot write any opinion because I hadn't received the Cd ""Mientras no cueste trabajo"" yet. Could you give some information about when it will deliver? The tracking information desapeer of my purchase profile.Thanks.Paula Aguirre"
1,Why?,"Why would anyone get this type of charger? For about $40, you can get an ""isupercharger"" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along."
1,New Lennon Review,"Well after my last scathing review of this album, someone had Amazon.com pull it because it was ""offensive."" It wasn't. If it was anything, my review was honest. So to paraphrase what I said before: I am not a fan of John Lennon or the Beatles, so maybe my opinion is biased, but I did not enjoy listening to this album in my friend's car. While the Beatles did rock at times, and while ""rocking"" is not the only good thing in music, I feel with this album someone is trying to make some extra $$$ off the work of a long since deceased man, and has therefore not cared about the quality of the album whatsoever. It is not well done, and I believe it to sound rather poor considering what they could have made it sound like."
2,Crap,"The only thing good here is the live stuff. Imagine is superb, John Sinclair is good, Luck of the Irish is a nice treat ... the rest is crap demos. I can't believe you Yoko, you have truly raped & ravaged the Lennon legacy! And Sean, you've grown up to be an annoying, spoiled b*stard!Don't get me wrong folks, these songs are true Lennon in every spirit of the word ... they're also crap demo sounding material, all of which are available in bootleg form ... ( a much better investment than this collection.)Peace."
3,Acoustic is a disappointment,"As a huge Lennon fan, I was looking forward to this release. Although there are a few gems on it such as the acoustic version of Cold Turkey, as well as the alternate versions of tunes from his first solo record (which, along with Imagine)is arguably his best album, as a whole, this CD comes across as a hodgepodge of great tunes and near misses. For a professional release, it sounds and has the feel of being a good bootleg collection. The songs vary in quality, mostly sounding clear and sharp- to a couple that are of inferior quality-and not quite listenable. The songs are also assembled haphazardly, with mostly studio (and/or in home recordings)to a couple of live songs that distract from the continuity. Avid Lennon fans out there may be irate with this review. However, if you are a completist, you will acquire this disc, but I cannot recommend Acoustic for the casual fan. For the novice fan, buy Lennon's first two solo albums. That is all you need..."
3,Important love notes from John.,"This music is rather personal, like looking in someones underwear drawer. John didn't expect to air this stuff, but Yoko was finally convinced of it's historical value, not commercial value, and released it as a favor to all the fans still missing John. I love John, he was my favorite Beatle in 1964. The music is sincere, raw, spirited, unplugged, heartfelt, moving, interesting, and more love from the original all you need is love man. Definitly worth ones time to listen too and reflect upon."
4,Could have been better,"There was a radio show a few years ago called the lost Lennon tapes. In those shows, they would feature hours, and I mean hours of acoustic Lennon, going through many songs, including covers, beatle tunes, improvisations, etc. Where's all that? There's a bunch of material out there to make a better compilation than this one. There are better bootlegs out there than this compilation. I am giving it 4 stars because the booklet is good, the idea of including guitar tabs is innovative. If you own the Lennon anthology, you dont need this. Otherwise, its OK, specially for begginers."
3,Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad,"""The Times of Harvey Milk"" and ""Common Threads"" are excellent documentaries and well worth having in your collection but take my advice and buy them separately and don't waste money on ""Where Are We?"". The premise of ""Where..."" is the directors traveling through parts of the country that might not be so receptive to an openly gay couple. Well, from the interviews you can't even tell if the subjects know they are being interviewed by two gay men. At no time do the directors identify themselves on the audio as being Gay. I rented ""Where..."" from Netflix and feel that it isn't up to the standards of their other documentaries. Rent it if you have to but don't waste money on it."
2,"Just some of the jokes are funny, others are outdated","This joke book was compiled by Mark Lemon (1809-1870) in 1865 and, unfortunately, many of the 1700 jokes, usually only a paragraph long, are no longer funny or are ruined by the heavy outdated language of England or the difference between the English and American culture. Others are clever, but do not rise to the level of being funny. For example: A stranger to law courts hearing a judge call a sergeant ""brother,"" expressed his surprise. ""Oh,"" said one present, ""they are brothers - brothers in law."" Or to quote another joke: The government, having threatened to proceed rigorously against those who refused to pay the assessed taxes, offered to them a remission of one fourth. ""This at least,"" said one sufferer, ""may be called, giving them some quarter."""
4,Lots of good ideas here,"It's obvious the Pardeys are not actors, but then I wouldn't want to take much advice about crossing oceans from actors would you? It's also obvious they made these programs on a budget. But did I enjoy them? Yup. I learned a lot of new ideas from and felt like I was sitting on board their boat seeing things through their eyes. I'd like to meet these two folks but this is probably the closest I'll ccome. Some of what I learned- some good ideas for setting up ground tackle, great stuff on their instant spinnaker pole arrangement, good stuff about storing gear well.This wasn't a guide for going cruising though, so I docked it one star - on the other hand, combined with their great books, it works pretty darned well."
3,Wheres the details,"I bought storm tactics, cross oceans, and Get Ready to cruise, Some of the stuff was interesting, but I was looking for more sailing tips and more actual sailing footage of technique, with shipping I paid $100 for all 3 DVD's really feel it was not worth the money."
1,Never sent my order!,"They never sent my order. I emailed them 10 times, and they didn't reply back to me. I went to my class with no book!"
1,Don't bother - not the original recordings,"Don't bother with this one folks. Only two of the songs on here are original recordings. The other songs MIGHT be re-recordings by the same, yet older, artists. But, I was not convinced - some of the songs may be by other artists. Too bad, because the sound quality is really good."
2,"Charlotte Chandler is very, very imperfect","I read Cameron Crowe's book a couple years ago, and it is head-and-shoulders above this. What Charlotte essentially does in this ""personal"" biography is string together a long series of celebrity interviews into one barely coherent narrative.One gets the distinct impression it was far more important for Charlotte to ""get to know"" these interview subjects than it was for her to write this book. What makes me think that? Perhaps it's the photos of Charlotte and several of her interviewees sprinkled throughout this book.On the whole, ""personal"" seems to be shorthand for ""lazy."""
1,Thoroughly disappointing!,"Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery."
2,ooopps,"I was missing 1 card, the sseker of crystals...I will probably buy another deck to make up the missing card"
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered the Inner Child Cards ""cards"" not book about the cards....what came is a green book that does not look anything like the represented item...which talked about the ""cards"" and had colored pictures of the different cards. This book is in black and white and has no cards with it. I am very unhappy that the item represented was not sent."
1,What a puny attempt at a love story,"I just finished this story, I gave it one star because it wasn't so bad that I simply couldn't force myself to read it. This is one of those books I felt obligated to finish simply because I started it. I skipped over every other paragraph and still stayed with the plot. I kept getting hung up though on the puny attempts at making this an interesting story. There was no depth to the story and the characters were very poorly built. How could Burke have been so devoted to Alys when he merely kissed her a few times. Alys was ever stubborn when Burke attempted to tell her his story. Yet she believed her family that had abused her. Silly, silly, she could stand up to Burke, but not the aunt who berated and beat her. This was no Cinderella story, just a sad attempt at some off beat fantasy. Sorry Ms. Delacroix, but you'll have to do better than this to keep your readers interest."
4,"Great spinner, terrible shipping time","We have a Zyliss salad spinner and love it. The string broke and so have to replace the lid. We ordered the lid through DBK shipping (who I guess is a distributor for zyliss products) and they just told me it takes 4-6 weeks for shipping!! I think that is very long time as I just spoke with them, they have the product but can't get to sending it out until next week via regular mail. hmmmm...."
1,Broke within two months!,"I bought one of these at target and it worked well while I had it, however the string that you pull to spin the salad got freyed and eventually ripped apart leaving the salad spinner useless. I wouldnt buy this again."
3,Synopsis,"The Case of the Missing HeiressA baby left on a doorstep, an heiress presumed dead, smuggled gems, cover-ups . . . and murder. To the Trueblood, Texas, P.I. Agency, Finders Keepers, it's more than solving the mystery. It's about reuniting a mother, a child . . . and a family.A Sister's SecretBrazilian heiress Terry Monteverde was supposedly killed in a tragic accident. But how could a dead woman give birth to a baby? Bounty hunter Rick Singleton goes underground in Rio to find out. His only lead is Terry's sister, Nina Monteverde. She's sweet, shy -- and not telling what she knows. Rick's a dangerous man to cross, but Nina's not afraid -- Rick is. He's defenseless against her innocent charm. And that scares the hell out of him."
1,A lot of typos!,"Do *not* buy this book. It is not well edited and contains numerous typos in the HTML and CSS syntax. It is now 2001 and this book was published in 1997, so it's very out of date. The browser compatibility charts only go up to Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4. There is no coverage of Opera at all. (The age of the book is not the author's fault, but if you are looking for a good reference, try Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos' book, or Eric Meyer's.)"
5,Great 'little' grill,"I bought this grill about a month ago. Its been great. I really thought it would be smaller than it is, but I've had no trouble with size. I've grilled everything from steaks to pork chops to chicken breasts to burgers and dogs and it cooks everything to perfection. Easy to maintain and doesnt take up alot of room. The only thing missing is a warming rack. But I found if you move the items you're cooking around to the 'less hot' areas, its fine. Love it!! I also definitely recommend the premium grill cover."
5,Heavy duty grill.,"Hello. I bought my new Weber Q300 just two weeks ago and I'm very satisfied customer. I like the design of that grill, and plenty space on grate. Before I got this grill I've just seen couple photos on web side and when UPS delivered to me the size of the grill really surprised me. You can cook for whole family."
5,QUALITY PRODUCT,"I replaced my old gas grill because the dripping fat ignited on the ceramic coals and burned the meat. The WEBER Q300 has a heavy iron grate that is heated by 3 stainless steel burners. You pre-heat the grilling surface and sear in the juices, then cook the meat with the grill cover closed using only the middle burner. This results in efficient use of propane and rapid, even cooking. The fat is collected in a pan at the bottom and rather than creating smoke and charring the meat, may be discarded later. The grill is large enough for a small family, easily assembeled, well designed and made of quality materials."
5,Great Grill by Weber,"Had a Weber Charcoal grill for years and findly bought the 300 gas grill to. Assembly was find but you really have to look for the axle rod for the Wheels , in cardboard box but hidden and protected real good , make sure you look real good before you call Weber.In short , like it very much . Can't go wrong on a Weber product , and make sure you buy the cover for it."
5,LOVE IT!,"This is by far the best grill I have ever owned. I also bought the Weber cover for the Q300 and 320 and it's great too. There is not really much more I can say about this grill that so many have not said alreay. It's easy to clean and maintain, heats up like nobody's business and does not take up a gigantic footprint but can still cook 2 huge racks of ribs, 4 ears of corn and hold my smoker box at the same time. I was thinking of gripes about it and unusually unlike me, I cannot really think of any. I love my grill and that's that."
1,"Perfect Grill - it is true, but broken by arrival.","It is definitely good grill! But just one thing, it is arrived damaged. Packaging is not good enough for the rude UPS guys.The package is huge and heavy, so I am not surprised that this item was broken. Did delivery service try to play soccer?I just went to the nearest hardware store and bought Q320 model, no difference except that little LED flash light was added and +$20.That is my story. I would set 5 stars, but people should be aware about the described issue, so in the contrast to the other commentsI set just 1 start, to make sure people can find this info easier."
2,Too similar to another great book,"I bought this book because its by the author of Jumper. While Mr. Gould writes some good stories... I was not impressed by this book.Within 5 minutes of reading the 1st chapter I knew right away this was Too similar to another great book, ""Conquistador"" by S.M. Stirling.Many parts of the book, mostly the tunnel to a parallel earth, and the wild animals on the other side are way too familiar to Stirling's ""Conquistador.""Overall ""Wildside"" is interesting fiction for the young adult reader.Its interesting to me that ""Conquistador"" by S.M. Stirling (clearly a superior read to Wildside) was 1st published in 2003 (and the ROC mass market paperback published in 2004) and apparently ""Wildside"" by Steven Gould was published in 2003. It makes me wonder if the two authors ever read each others work."
1,Not as pictured,"These mailers are not white as they appear in the photo. They are a dull gray. Also, the bubble material inside is very thin. I can't use these for my products and will be sending them back."
5,extremely effective,"Spamfire has done an excellent job of Spam filtering. It has caught every bit of Spam. On occasion it catches legitimate messages, but it learns very quickly. I use Spamfire with Entourage and have had no problems. It's extremely easy to use."
