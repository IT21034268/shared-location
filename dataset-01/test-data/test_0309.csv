1,Just learn how to scream like Christina Aguilera!!!!,"Seriously... I must admit, this album is not good as her last 2 albums.We all know BRITNEY SPEARS can not sing... I am going to say this again, she can not sing! She needs a vocal lessons in this album, if she wants to re-record it.Her voice changes... sometimes it sounds like a womans than it sounds like a 12 yr old girl is trying to sing... *WEIRD*My advice is, she needs to learn how to scream, like XTINA, and she is off to better successful carrier!Dont buy this CD!"
4,STOP COMPARING BRITNEY TO OTHER ARTISTS,Stop comparing Britney to other artists such as Christina Aguilera or Avril Lavigne!It drives me nuts!
2,Pleeezzzzz.....,"This CD is no different than if you went and bought the first album of Christina Aguilera. Sure, Britney might've put some hip-hop into her songs and I respect that. But the songs like Overprotected and I'm not a girl ; Not Yet a Woman are just dumb songs! Listening to these songs are like reading a teeny-boppers diary! I'm sorry but if Britney should ever get any better I suggest that she'd stick to her hip-hop songs because pop just isn't doing her right."
5,"GREAT! This is the ""Britney"" CD --TO BUY--","Don't get the normal version of Britney which doesn't has the 3 bonus tracks... BUY THIS ONE! It's only $18 which is..what? The price of any normal regular CD?The 3 bonus songs are great...truly some of the best of Brit's career. It's a shame these weren't on the original edition of ""Britney"" ... but if you're thinking about buying this version of the album, DO IT! You won't regret it.Before The Goodbye, I Run Away, and When I Found You are great tracks and some of Brit's best. This is such a good deal!"
1,Do yourself a favor...,"...and pick up Avril Lavigne's ""Let's Go"". Not the best music by any means, but she's much better than Britney because she actually DOES love rock and roll..."
4,All Britney,"The title of the Cd fits perfectly, because, well, this is all Britney. Some of the beats in the songs are similar yet, I liked ""Overprotected"" and ""Cinderella"". It's about time she grew up. The attempt to reinvent herself did not fly well with critics and/or fans. Though bubblegum pop is fading, this record is definitely apart of that fade."
4,old-school style,"Even though the pot's description says its a 2-3/4 quart soup pot, it turned out to be a lot smaller than I imagined. Overall, its quite good though, distrubutes heat very well and is really cute (I chose the red one). I got it because this brand is known to last long and have great quality cookware, and it's proven itself thus far. If you are looking for a great slow-cooker, or old-fashioned soup pot, this is the way to go. Be careful though, if you are used to non-stick types with plastic handles... this pot heats up fast and super hot."
4,Can't Go Wrong For Free,I downloaded it and like the behind the scenes look at all the characters going to be in the movie
1,Just an advertisement for the movie,I mistakenly thought this was the movie and was very disappointed to find it was just a glorified advertisement for the movie. I would not recommend this.
1,Unnecessary add-on recommended by Amazon,I purchased animal clippers and these combs were a recommended add-on. I took the bait and tried to use them with the clippers. They are good quality and fit well on the clippers however they make the shaving efforts cumbersome and difficult. My animal's hair kept getting pulled and when she yelped I finally removed them and proceeded with just the clippers. Doing that worked like a charm but these were a big disappointment. I would not recommend these to anyone.
4,Brit history,"Story takes place in Cornwall and the scenery and constumes during the times of the French Revolution and the closing of the copper and tin mines are breathtaking. There are stories within stories of ruling families and families striving to become so. The resulting famine and suffering of the cornish people and their struggles to survive (smuggleing, etc.) are shown. The lead, Ross Poldark plays his part extremely well. There are, however, some characters who are such hams that they should have been reined in by the director early on. I enjoyed it."
2,Missed Pictures,"Camera takes okay pictures on ""red eye"" or ""auto setting."" However, the delay between depressing the shutter button to the actual picture can seem like an eternity. Therefore, many opportunites are missed. Especially when photographing children. In the past I have used cameras with similar features that did not have such a significant delay. Obviously, this delay is the difference between a good picture and no picture."
2,red eye,The camera is o.k. I purchased this camera because consumer reports gave it a good review. Every picture I have taken with the red eye reduction flash on everyone still has red eyes. I am very disappointed with this feature
2,The book should have been a long magazine article,"The book has suprisingly little information for its 250 page length. Winchester spends a great deal of time describing static scenarios and making inferences because he knows he's short on action. You can burn through it rapidly, but keep your dictionary handy."
4,Fascinating read!,"I'd never even thought about how a dictionary was put together; now I have a new appreciation and admiration for the tireless work required to publish a dictionary and, really, any book of reference. This book was absorbing, even for a non-etymologist like me!"
2,A great tale badly told,"The story of James Murray's obsessive work on compiling the Oxford English Dictionary is a fascinating one. However, 'The Profesor and the Madman' by Simon Winchester sensationalizes an aspect of this undertaking that should exist as a footnote, or a chapter at best. O.K. already, so the man was in a cushy asylum and had a lot of time on his hands.For a more in-depth account of the origins of the OED try 'Caught in the Web of Words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary' by K.M. Elisabeth Murray."
3,Really slow read. Not for teens.,"Unfortunately, of all the amazing books written by British authors, my son's Senion HS English teacher chose this book for the summer reading selection. My son struggled to get thru it for abuot 6 weeks and never actually finished it. It was painful. I thought I'd read a few pages and summarize them for him to help speed up the process. Then I understood what he was up against. Nearly every paragraph had a word, phrase or concept that he would have no prior knowledge of, so no wonder he found it so boring. I felt sorry for him and angry that his teacher would squander the opportunity to turn kids on to an amazing story. This is about the process of composing the Oxford English Dictionary during the Civil War era. Yawn! There are THOUSANDS of great British novels to choose from, so unless you want something to put you to sleep, don't pick this one!"
2,Much like reading a dictionary.,"Lacked creativity. Did not hold my attention. This story, and the exhaustive research behind it, could have produced a charming short story."
2,Another side to madness,"As others have said, this is an intriguing story told in a disjointed way. We constantly bounce from Minor's sad condition to that of the main editor and their friendship. I never saw much about their relationship to make me believe they really knew each other. More frustrating was the author's writing style, which reminded me of reading a dictionary. In addition I have never seen so many colons (:) used in one book. He uses the passive voice to a very large and distracting degree. The story is interesting but I am surprised that the book is such a big bestseller."
2,"Disappointing, Finished With Wanting More...","I found this book disappointing. It was a fairly quick read but not because it was compelling. I thought his chronology too muddled, jumping back and forth between interesting facts (that illustrate his obsessive research) to rather broad historical summations that really should have been explored more closely.To his credit, I 'found' his descriptions of Minor, Murray and Merrett very intriguing and well written ('found' because they are literally strewn haphazardly throughout the book), which kept me reading, but ultimately, this book left me with wanting more."
4,needed better editing,"I enjoyed this story...but found that it jumped around in a disconcerting fashion. Took too many detours to no story-telling purpose.Very accessible book, interesting story. Kept me engaged."
2,2 men and a book,The Professor and the Madman is a moderately engaging story of two men and the making of the Oxford English Dictionary. The history of the dictionary itself is the most interesting aspect of this book. The intertwined story of the madman contributor is distracting and tedious.
2,Insulting!,"It's bad enough that most trade books are poorly edited, but a book aimed at word-nerds should be pristine. Is it laziness? Stinginess? There's no excuse."
3,"Should have been a long article, not a 240 page book","It is an engaging article: one of the chief contributors to the massive Oxford English Dictionary was an inmate in an asylum. It is not enough to fill a book, however. With one character imprisoned and the other at his desk reading, there isn't much going on - certainly not enough to sustain my interest."
4,BIG WORK IN LITTLE ENGLAND,"Despite author Simon Winchester's sometimes strained, tangential prose, this is a very fine little book. Although primarily an historical mystery, a love of words and word origins on the part of the reader couldn't hurt. The two main characters, (Professor) Murray and (Madman) Minor, are carefully drawn, almost painfully realized in light of the great task before them, the staggering complexities of their own private lives in a much more primitive age, and the shortness of life itself.It does seem curious that, unlike the vast majority of historical biographies, there are (aside from the cover) no record of photographs here, only a few nice etchings. It may be that Winchester wanted to enhance the ""novel"" feel of his book rather than adhere to strict historical norms, if there is such a thing."
4,Fast-paced and well written.,Who would have thought that this topic would turn into such a page turner? I found the two main characters fascinating men. The author delivers the goods in a concise and well-designed book.
4,Great diversion,"The OED is an astounding accomplishment, and this ""backstory"" is as much fun to read about such an imposing work's creation as you might ever hope to read. Perhaps more than you need to know, but very satisfying and a jolly jaunt through an historical anecdote."
2,Not very well written for a book about words,"While it is heartening to see a book about the OED on the best-sellers list, I really wish that it had been written with a little more care. What is potentially an engrossing mystery at the heart of the creation of the definitive English lexicon is mired in a hash of choppy sentences and ""sesquipedalians"" that have been thrown in to make sure the reader knows that the author has in fact looked at the OED at least once in his life, but which more often than not are used in place of a shorter word that would be more appropriate. The bottom line is that this book reads like it was written by a journalist with a good thesaurus (as it was) and not by someone who really cares about words and good writing (as it should have been)."
2,What a disappointment!,"I agree, I am afraid, with the bulk of the one-star reviews. This is a magazine article that through repetition and circular, irrelevant writing has managed to squeek through at book length. Even worse, is what is missing. We get only a limited sense of the content of Minor's contributions, and as another reader has pointed out, although Winchester claims that this is a book with two protagonists, we get only peripheral background on Murray. There really isn't any story here, and in fact, by disproving the rather jolly myth of the two men's first meeting, there isn't even any drama. Minor writes for the OED from Broadmoor, while Murray gratefully receives his contributions. This is one story that probably would have been better as a source for fiction or drama; limited to the facts (with, as others point out, a lot of conjecture) it is hardly worth the effort to pare through the irrelevant tangents to find the kernel of the true story."
3,What happened to organization?,"The story is a very compelling one. However, if you're not a person obsessed with the origins of the English language, Winchester's vocabulary and all of the information on the creation of the OED might get a tad tedious.Another problem with the book is that it lacks logical organization. Winchester goes jumping from one subject to the next, from time period to time period with no smooth transitions. While reading it, it took awhile for my brain to catch up with what my eyes were reading.As much as I liked the basis behind the book, I couldn't believe that it ever spent time at the top of the New York Times Bestseller list. If Winchester would have spent more time on organization than looking up difficult words that less than half the world's population can understand the book would have been much better.It's worth a read if you're looking for something educational and weird, but not for the faint of heart. (Self mutilation is in there.)"
2,Disappointed,Received a glowing revue about this book. Could have been much better. Can I ell it back? Maybe the (P.S.) in title meant Pretty Stinky! Bob
5,A must-read for all word lovers!,"For anyone interested in words, psychology, or Victorian England, this book is essential. Winchester has woven a rich tale about the development of the Oxford English Dictionary, its first editor, and its most prolific contributor--a mental patient. As an Anglophile, psychology teacher, and linguistics buff, I enjoyed this short book tremendously and would highly recommend it to anyone with similar interests."
4,A quick-read; diverting and somewhat disturbing.,"The subtitle is apt: ""A Tale..."" Simon Winchester tells a story that is ""a fine conjunction"" of three entities (Murray, Minor and the OED). Initially put off by the frankly scary details of Minor's problems, I finally began to enjoy the book and was awed by Winchester's telling of how Dr. Minor endured his years at Broadmoor.Therefore this was not only a story, a true if possibly embellished story, but an insight to the life of an intelligent, disturbed man forever incarcerated.And although I have no quibbles about the bulk of Winchester's content, I don't really think we needed to read the specifics in the chapter entitled ""The Unkindest Cut."" This marred a telling that had otherwise not indulged in shock exploitation of the book's subject."
4,An engrossing look at madness and lexicography,"I saw Simon Winchester discussing his work on C-SPAN's Book Notes, and found the story (and the story telling) too interesting to pass. The book details the lives of two men in vastly different circumstances who chance upon each other through the work surrounding the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. While many have criticized Winchester's style of jumping from one life to the other, I find that it complimented the subject matter quite nicely. That he often offers brief diversions on various background subjects (including lexicography), is another enhancement of the book. Yes, he is somewhat academic, but he tells the story beautifully.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who has a love of words."
5,Still A Fan,"The thing I think I like most about JLC is that each of their cds is something completely new. Whether they're folky, more melodious, or just rocking out, this band delivers. And this cd is no different. It's not like their others, but that doesn't mean it isn't great. This cd is absolutely gorgeous. The rich vocals, the melodies that just get inside of you, making you nod your head with the rhythm and getting you to hum along when it sticks in your head. JLC (well, just Jump) has taken a step in a new direction, and they're completely successful. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys music."
4,A fine album,"I have been waiting for this album since hearing them play several of the songs at a small show in Baltimore. It does not disappoint. Jump is at their best when they do the mid-tempo, melodic pieces that highlight their lead singer's lovely voice. But, the more up-tempo songs are also very appealing. This is a solid pick up for anyone who is currently disillusioned with the state of pop music. Albums like this are enough to restore your faith that there is good music being made out there."
3,For the people Buying this item thinking its the entire Ernest collection. It's far from it.,"This set is pretty ok for the money. It had the very hard to find films such as Ernest ride's again and Ernest goes to school. Picking this set up for those 2 films alone is worth it. But if you wanting the entire ernest collection, Well then your just going to have to buy all the movies by them self's. This contains only a few films and everything else is just never before seen footage, Some footage released threw different companies so it would be nothing new."
1,Too many issues,We had 3 of these units installed 5 years ago when our home was built. One starting going off on the lower level far away from any possible CO release. Then a few months later a 2nd unit starting going off. I changed out batteries and still beeping. I took the 3rd unit and put in in place of one of them....no beeping. After reading these comments I'm not repurchasing this product. I'll change out the base and switch to a unit that does not have so many problems....not worth the risk to re-buy this one.
4,breath of fresh air,"I am glad to finally read a romance novel that doesn't revolve around sex. I have read every Jude Deveraux book and I went in search of a new author. My little sister had Tori Phillips's ""Silent Knight"" and begged me to try it. I am glad to say that I have found a new author for me to enjoy and I love how she reminds me of Jude Deveraux. They are the only two authors of romance novels that I will recomend to my friends. Now I say to all my friends - ""Grab a Tori Phillips book, a glass of iced tea and a snack and you are set for the day."" Grab a book and enjoy!!!"
4,Good movie,"When I watched this movie I was pleasantly surprised. The story started out to be what I thought was going to be another ""Quiz Show"", but it turned out a lot different. It's a great movie for those who enjoy a love story with a twist. It's plot was ironic in places, and the ending was a bit of a surprise. I actually found it to be quite interesting to see how people so beat up, find hope in each other and end up being happy in the end."
5,Learn Fitness from a Champion...,"Rachel McLish is a Great Champion, and is responsible for opening the world of bodybuilding to many Women. She is thoughtful in her tutorials and has tips for those who are not able to do a full workout, so that anyone can get the maximum benefit according to their potential.Her routines are primarily based on dumbells, are easily done at home, and do not require access to a Gym.Her fitness routines can be done by people of any age, and are very easily done while travelling. If you want a fitness regemin you can do for the rest of your Life... This is the One."
4,Very good,"It's a good book, I would like to have more information about stretching, but all in all is very good, I recommend it. thanks"
3,It's just okay,I would have enjoyed it more if it indicated how many reps on each page. I also eat raw food which includes only fruits and vegetables and her food guide does not really work for this type of life style.
3,"broke, but maybe my fault","I didn't see any problems with the string. It DID break when I tightened the peg, but I think it was my inexperience--this was my first time replacing a string, and I had a feeling that it was going to break before it did because of the way it was wrapping on the peg.I did not follow the suggestion on the envelope: ""Before Stringing Your Instrument Have You ... Lubricated the bridge & nut grooves with a soft lead pencil?""Next time, I'll try lubricating the peg with graphite."
2,Very limited book,This book doesn't deals with European wines which leaves a big gap in coverage. There is not description on the wines and no information other than how many gold/silver/bronze medal this wine won. Save your money!
3,Asks but doesn't answer all the questions,"I was looking for ways to explain my pro-evolution stance to fellow evangelicals and was a little disappointed. The author asks all the relevant questions I could think of (extra-terrestrials, pre-adamite humans, sin and the fall, theodicy) but his answers seem brief and incomplete. Written for the already convinced."
1,false conclusion,"The author arrives at the incorrect answer to the question he approaches. Darwinian evolution is impossible without death. Thus, to allow that some single-celled organism evolved into people (an absurd conclusion, but beside the point of this review) depends on the acceptance of millions of millions of deaths before humans showed up.However, we know from the Bible that death was a direct result of humankind's rebellion against God. This is a basic tenet of Christian belief. As such, it would be impossible for death to lead to the existence of humans. Therefore, there is no way darwinian evolution and Christian belief can coexist."
3,Awesome Firepit; bad paint job,"We bought this firepit to use for the summer. It is nice and heavy-duty, well built and large enough to accommodate a bigger fire. I placed sand and a few firestone bricks on the bottom to slow the eventual corrosion of the bottom. The spark arrester works great as does the poker, however after the first use, the paint on the outside began to peel and flake off. Not too big of deal, i can just repaint it, but thought people should know what to expect."
4,We love it,"Comes with all the accesories one could want- grill for cooking, cover to keep embers in, and a poker.Easy to put together and looks nice."
2,Cheap construction,"Finally got around to assembling this. Ordered it too long ago to return, or I would. Thought this was the same pit a friend had got... But it is a cheap knockoff. Thin metal, poor alignment of the screw holes and the seams. Rim around edge is multiple pieces and screwed on instead of welded on. So are the legs. Doesn't come with a cover... And you don't want to get water in this so you need to get one. Overall... Disappointed. I will use it... But it looks like it will wear/rust out in a couple of years and I will need to replace it. Suggest you search for similar items that are better made."
5,Some Assembly Requred but MORE than worth it!!!!,"For the last two weekends, we've had two, very large bonfires in our Landmann pit and we LOVE it! In fact, we now sort of wish we'd bought an even larger one. This model is large enough for a crowd of five or six to toast their tootsies and marshmallows at the same time.The construction seems extremely sturdy - there is a bit of assembly required; the two of us were able to do this in about twenty minutes. The pit itself can easily hold a fairly large pile of kindling and about six 18"" to 24"" logs easily. Each fire we've had has been at least four hours in duration and we've noticed no burn-through or scorching on the ground underneath the pit.A GREAT deal!I was a bit skeptical, given the ridiculously low price but"
5,Very Nice Fire Pit....The best I've seen.....,"Very Nice Pit..I looked everywhere for a nice pit, found none all looked cheap and had a big price tag. I checked out the reviews on this one and took a chance and Wow it's nice. Some people complained about the paint burning off. Well Guess what...The bigger the fire the more Heat it will produce. Just repaint it LOL.You Can't Go Wrong With This One"
2,Not for a rainy environment!,"I do own this but not sure who it shipped from. This was pretty for about one year. The top cover has rusted through. The bottom is all rusted but still useable but really an eyesore. It has also left rust marks on the cement. Functionally it is great, it is just not meant for a wet environment like England unless you have a covered storage place for it."
5,Just what it said,"This is quite nice for the price. Exactly as pictured, and seems pretty solid. I wouldn't put a large fire in it, but don't see the need to."
4,Nice product and value,"Lots of reviews here, so will only bring up new stuff... the ring assembles fine, if you have it upside down you will have problems. Shouldn't one drill a small hole or two at the bottom of this thing so it will not hold water? Especially if sand will cover it. forget about the 2-cent Landmann cover sold separately.This pit holds more wood than my whole-house woodstove. Got 7x 16"" logs in there at one point. It never looks that big though and that's a good thing.One minor gripe is there is no burn control (not sure how they could do that anyway), so this thing has mega-oxygen available all the time, so burns fast and white. Maybe its the side shape-vents that prevent a deeper layer of coals from forming.Having our fire up on the deck now is priceless. Very good purchase."
4,One of the Best,"Yellow Hammer is one of the best drums out there, DEFINITELY one of my favorites. This is a good CD, I have it, and the reviewer who called it ""world"" music, referred to them as ""Mr. Hammer,"" and said they are singing the same song over and over again hasn't got a CLUE what they are talking about. It's a real shame for them to let it go to waste like that. They should find somebody who knows powwow music who will appreciate the singing and give it to them to rock out to. ayee... :D"
4,Artful Weaving,"Jennifer Haigh has developed an artful tapestry weaving the threads of one man's life with those of three women who will be his wives. She has done a superb job of creating characters who ""jump off the page"" and stay with you long after you close the book for the last time."
4,A RIVETING PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY,"An ingenious look at the life of a conman, ""Mrs. Kimble"" sketches the details of the devious Ken Kimble through the eyes of his three consecutive wives. Over the span of twenty-five years, the infamous husband goes from choir director to drifter to real estate agent, acquiring a new spouse with each new identity. Haigh's storytelling skills will draw you in and leave you mesmerized. And, her well-drawn characters will have you rooting for each of the three Mrs. Kimbles in turn. An interesting psychological study, ""Mrs. Kimble"" also offers great fodder for book group discussions. How do we define our identities in relation to our spouses? Why are so many women attracted to ""the wrong kind"" of men? In the end, the author offers an uplifting message about the strength of family, in all its convoluted forms."
4,Great Read,"I was very fascinated with this book. Not your typical novel but well worth the read. Mr Kimble marries 3 women, each one loved him dearly until after the wedding and he said ""I do."" Unfortunately there are probably a lot of Mr Kimbles out there, but this one is really a sneaky, evil, self centered man who probably didn't love anyone but himself. I think any woman who has been deceived by any man will enjoy reading this book if nothing else,to realize there is probably one more who is worse than you can imagine. I hope I am not revealing too much when I say he finally gets his own just rewards. To every woman who has ever been deceived, get this book and enjoy the complexity of Kimble's lack of heart. Not a downer at all, just a book that makes you feel you are not alone in your struggle finding a man with an honest heart."
1,Pathetic women,"I can't even finish the drivel! Honestly as a woman I cannot understand how another woman could find this interesting or worth her time. Yes, there are horrible men in this world, but you don't simply bend over and allow them to destroy your entire life! You realize that you have made a terrible mistake, you dump the bastard, you grieve, and you move on. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful! Yes, the story is well written but I was nauseated by the pathetic behavior of these women!"
3,Some misleading information,"Overall this book is good; however, there are some mis-leading or out-of-date information. First, there are not that many bible quotes so people complaining about that should take a hike. I am more concern about mis-leading health information. For example, she recommends soy products and corn because it contains IP6. Unfortunately, all soy and corn products especially from the USA are now GMO. Also, she recommends taking cayenne pills. This is a big mistake. You need to take cayenne from the mouth in order to prepare the stomach for its arrival. If you take a cayenne pill you shock the stomach when the cayenne pill dissolves, I have come to the conclusion that there are few real experts these days writing books. Don't believe any author until you check various sources."
3,NO CD,"i have yet to receive this cd so i can't give a review about it. If i ever receive it, then i can give u a review."
5,Grand Slams is the Funniest Baseball Book Ever,"Hi, I am Glenn Liebman and I am the author so I am hardly unbiased. I loved putting Grand Slams together. Over one thousands of baseball's greatest and meanest quotes. Some of my favorites include Casey Stengel talking about star pitcher and party animal Don Larsen who wrapped his car around a telephone poll at 5 am. during spring training. Casey said, ""He was either out pretty late or up pretty early."" Pitcher Dennis Lamp once said of outfielder Luis Polonia's defensive abilities--""If you hit Polonia 100 fly balls, you could make a movie out of it--Catch 22. Got to love the work ethic of hall of famer Hack Wilson who said about playing drunk--""I have never played drunk. Hungover, yes, but never drunk.""If you like these quotes than there are 998 more waiting for you. Makes for a great gift idea for any baseball fan. (...) Thank you and enjoy the book."
5,RECOMMENDED!!!,"Before I had even heard of the band, Burn in Silence and Jacknife (along with Autumn Offering and some other band...or something...) toured my city a few months ago. BRUTAL metalcore stuff, and I love it. Great to mosh with. Buying this album today! FYI, Burn in Silence are back on tour with Year of Desolation this time! Check your local venues..."
4,Good service,Arrived before the time expected. Nice general quality of book and its contents. Useful for my sales management degree. Well structured and updated.
5,Singing it,"Beautifull music for Sopran (Pamina and Queen of the night) and for Bariton (Papageno). (Also Tenor (Tamino) and Bas (Sarastro))The book has all the highlights from the opera, clearly writen for Piano and Vocals. Some bits are easier, some harder, but the music is superb!"
3,tiefschwarz makes it worthwhile,"DM will stay the best band 4ever, no matter what, but these remixes are not very impressing (all the remixes for the Angel.singles were flat, except the jacques lu cont mix for A pain that i am used to and some suffer well remixes like tiga's or m83's) the same case here: even UNKLE couldn't make an interesting remix for such a great song, the only tracks i really enjoyed are the ones made by the majestic tiefschwarz, his dub is more interesting, IMHO, but the dave is in the disco mix will be played in clubs mostly, i guess, it uses all the vocal part, and also great samples from the original. cool."
5,buy it! you won't regret! it works great!,I have tried several bluetooth devices and this one works the best and was the least expensive. I'm glad I bought it- it was worth every penny! Only one drawback- the ear hook (adjustable/removable) is only reinforced with metal halfway through the hook so if you aren't careful (you throw it in your purse or briefcase) it might break.... BUT you can purchase 5 earhooks from Jabra online (directly) for 9.99 so I gave this product five stars because it out performs motorola and plantronics (which I tried) for way less $$$$
1,Americans Lost,I found this book to have inadequate content especially in the areas concerning the September 11 tragedy. Each interview starts with a brief background and lacks decent questioning of the interviewees. I found this book to be poorly written and not worth the purchase.
3,ears that cried in the dark,"I purchased this cd for my mother-in-law, as she wanted to give it as a gift to one of her best friends. (They apparently got married to the title-track song--and this was the reason we wanted this cd.)So, since I haven't heard how it sounded, I called mother-in-law, and asked if she received the cd. Yes, she had and was a bit upset that the last song on the cd (title track) skipped a bit....oh well, I thought I'd gain some brownie points for getting her this, but I guess not...at least most of it was good!"
1,Shoddy construction,Don't waste your money. It broke the first time I used it. Had to return it and bought an EZ Up instead. Much better.
4,Dr. Seuss Does It Again!,Dr. Seuss is doing an excellent job teaching my 5 year old son to read. Hop on Pop is fun and exciting and supports letter/sound recognition. It develops reading patterns and reinforces the concept of rhyming words. I definitely recommend it for emergent readers.
5,Terrific movie,"I purchased this movie (some time ago) because it was great. Many of my friends have seen this because of me and have all agreed with me. Not to mention an AWESOME singer, Alechia James has a song in this movie too. During the scene where Perkins is on her bed shutting the world out crying and such - that's Alechia. I think this is a female movie especially seeing the review one male reviewer gave."
1,Save your money,"Her Husband was hit by a car while out jogging, she didn't know. She want the house repainted she and her friends like the painters backside!"
3,Ok AIP Horror,"""Die, Monster, Die"" is passable stuff for horror fans, with good atmosphere, photography, and art direction, and of course the presence of Karloff; but plotwise it's a bit of a tangle, a hackneyed adaptation of Lovecraft's 'The Color Out of Space' that loses the flavor of the story in trying to adapt it to the conventions of the Price/Corman/Poe films. Unique source material is, unfortunately, boiled down to a series of cliches. But for dedicated horror fans, they're good cliches."
1,Didn't Work,We experienced the same problem others have with this microphone shutting the whole leap pad off. We couldn't really play it much b/c the slightest movement of the microphone would shut it down and we'd have to start over. The Leap Pad also didn't recognize it as a leap pad cartridge many times when it was plugged in. Seems like it would be a very fun addition to the Leap Pad if it worked though.
4,Casino Royale Soundtrack Review,"The music on this album fits in very micely with the James Bond films. The best thing about this soundtrack is the outstanding rendition of the James Bond Theme-perhaps the best since the original. The only negative is that for the first time, the theme song is missing from the album. This is surprising since every other Bond Soundtrack has this element included. I suspect this is just another ploy to get people to spend more money for this missing piece. David Arnold is by far the best composer to work on the Bond movies since John Barry."
4,Good theme,"Despite the unforgiveable omission of Chris Cornell's main song, the CD is quite satisfying, underscoring the dark and romantic themes of the film. A particular favorite is ""Vesper"" used in the shower sequence, a tune largely played on the piano. It is also well reprised. Probably David Arnold's best Bond score yet."
2,Somethings missing?,"The Chris Cornell theme song ""You Know My Name"" is NOT on the CD! What the F***!"
5,An Excellent Re-Boot for an Excellent Re-Boot,"Frankly, I'm only writing this review to negate the detrimental effect of other reviewers bringing the rating down because it does not included Chris Cornell's ""Know My Name"" introduction song(which was great, no doubt). But this is an original score, something different from a soundtrack, which confuses many people.Now, this is the first Bond movie released in the last 8+ years to not completely suck. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sir Connery and the overall production was just fantastic. That statement includes David Arnold's score. Cues like ""African Rundown"" and ""Miami International"" are epic in scope and exceedingly appropriate for the actions on screen. I thoroughly enjoy this score and hope the next effort for Quantum of Solace turns at just as well."
3,"""Casino"" Soundtrack Cashes Out ...","While just about everything related to ""Casino Royale"" is a winner, I can't include the soundtrack. This is easily the weakest of Arnold's Bond scores. Though I think it's generally a good thing when a film's score goes largely unnoticed, it's not what we've come to expect of Bond. Sadly, however, there's nothing memorable or remarkable here. The score's one strong suit--heavily sampling of the theme ""You Know My Name""--is undermined by the song's omission. A soundtrack where the theme isn't included? What marketing genius came-up with that one ..."
3,Why is this series listed for 6-9th grade????,The 4th book is not suitable for 6-9th grades. I can see the appeal to 6-9 graders in the simplicity of the story. I am an adult that likes to read fantacy/magical fiction. My problem with this series is that the main character (Alanna) sleeps with the prince and 2 other guys in the fourth book.
1,Factory Reject,"well considering that I recieved a factory reject I am not to happy with the product. the book starts on page 21 goes to page 45 then goes back to page 21 and then completes the book from there. I have read the book many time before buying this copy and it is a fantastic book, just not the one I recieved from Amazon."
3,Good series for young readers,"I finished the series on a plane from Florida. I was enchanted while I read, entranced even for a while after. But when the spell wore off, I realized that while the plot is good, the characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the stories are without any deeper significance. It's a good, light, superficial read but will not really leave any impressions on the soul. In Tortall, things float in and out without leaving traces (like some of Alanna's thief friends, Gary, and Raoul), and some of the things that are most important in the first novels (the Ordeal) don't really matter in the others. Alanna really doesn't think too much about the Ordeal after it's over. The series is good, but not great. Fine for younger readers, OK for older ones too, but make sure that there are REAL fantasy stories available too. I recommend it but will also say that Sabriel (Garth Nix) is much better and is fully rounded, with a four-dimensional world like our own."
3,Indiffrent,"The action was good, but you could just go ahead and cut out half of the mushy and inappropriate parts. The Roof of the World was interesting, however."
1,This edition has LOTS of misprints!,"I love love love Tamora Pierces books and especially the Alanna series. This review is NOT for the quality of the story or the writing in the book but for Amazon and the publisher. This edition of Lioness Rampant has some really bad misprints and I didn't have the chance to read it in time before the return window so I'm stuck with it.... maybe it will be worth something someday.. Guess I'll buy another copy but a different edition. Anyway Yes the series is great and if you are reading this review on deciding whether or not you want it, you can always return it."
4,"""Excellent source of frozen yogurt recipes""","Or so my wife tells me... she photocopied half the frozen yogurt section from the library before deciding we should buy the book. So far as I can remember, they were all good."
2,ok but sound quality not quite right,"Have the vinyl and on tape, vintage has been reproduced many times on cd,the cds have just been titled differently,but on this particular produced one the sound reproduction is just not quite right,found it a little dissapointing just in that area,it is good early heat music but if you listen to it on other reproduced media cds,this one just does not have good quality reproduction"

4,Well Done !,"I was wondering what series to read after the conclusion of ""The Lost Swords"" series ? Well this is it.The masks of Gods that people merge with is an excelent basis for what I hope is a verry long series of enjoyable reading! WELL WRITTEN & WELL DONE!"
1,Don't waste your time,"The prose in this novel is so bad as to be painful. The plot is weak, and the author seems to have forgotten what he was planning for the characters. I really get the impression that this was written to fulfill some sort of contract obligations. It is just that awful."
2,I have doubts about Saberhagen writing this himself...,"Maybe he wrote the outline and then gave it to a high school student to finish.The repetition is extremely annoying. At one point (page 171 to be exact) it is mentioned that a character is lucky not to have been injured in a fall. Then it is mentioned twice more in the next few paragraphs.There also seems to be some confusion in the flow of time. Days will appear to have gone by and then it turns out to be the same afternoon. I hate to say it, but it is almost like Mr. Saberhagen would write a few lines, have a couple of cocktails and then write a few more. Doesn't TOR have editors that read these books before they are printed?I have read almost all of Fred Saberhagen's books and am terribly disappointed by this one. I will read the next in the series, but if it isn't any better, then it is time move on."
1,pay for what you get,"""I purchased three of these units and within one year two of the three had failed. The flood lights do not come on when sensing motion at night, but the motion detector light indicates motion is sensed. The flood lights will come on in the test mode but won't come on in normal mode. I believe the daylight sensor has gone bad and the units cannot tell that nightime has come. I was not able to locate a web site for this company for support or warranty information."""
4,Touching and Familiar,"This book was just what I needed to soothe my soul during these troubled times. World of Pies delves into the everyday life of small town America bringing a smile along with it.Our unlikely guide through everyday life is twelve year old Roxanne, Roxie to her friends. We follow Roxie from a budding teenager to womanhood, through good times and bad, coming full circle to Roxies' own daughter Sophie.Roxanne learns early the price one pays for standing up for what a person believes in when her own mother defends the right of a person of color to exhibit her pies in the pie fair. Her mom is shunned by those she called ""friend"" and her dad's business suffers for a time but as a family they are able to weather the storm with great humour.The receipes in the book are a wonderful touch and best of all they are delicious! I highly recommend both the story and the recipes to any reader."
3,Easy read,"This book was definitely an easy read. I was expecting to enjoy a colorful book packed with Southern-flavored humor, but I was hoping to be more challenged. Although I found the writing to be colorful throughout parts of the book, I was disappointed that so much of the story was spelled out by the author and not much room was left for reader's interpretation and imagination. I found that many of the events that took place in the book were a little too 'neat' and 'convenient'. Aside from the fact that I felt some parts of the story were 'forced', I did find myself lauging at some of the antics of the characters. I do think, however, that this author has a talent for story-telling and I'm sure I will read another one of her books."
1,Uninspiring,"This book had so many chances to develop thought-provoking story lines, but instead jumped out of a story as quickly as it was started. The characters were quite bland, as many weren't even given a chance to be explored before the focus changed yet again. This was an easy read in terms of the length, but a hard read due to boring storylines."
5,Reflections,"Even though my small childhood home in Indiana is miles from Texas, reading this book made me realize even more clearly that the passage from youth to adult is universal. As I eagerly turned the pages my mind was filled with pictures of my friends, Bonnie, Karen, Terri. The giggles, the adventures, fighting and making up again. Discovering secerts and the long summers that made up our youth. Roxie's journey is fraught with laughter, when she and her boyfriend are caught necking in the ""wrong place."" To tears, the loss of her father and Tommy's return from war. Uncertainty in love, to finding ""the one"". It's all there, wrapped in the glow of rememberance that Karen Stolz writes of so well. No matter what era you grew up in, there is a bit of all of us in this charming book. Enjoy......"
3,I learn something from this Sci-Fi film.,"I was 11 years old, but I had wondered ""how would you talk to someone from an advanced race if you had no common language"". This film was not the best of sci-fi flicks, but it was the first film, that explained how you would do it. I learned something that day, that would stay with me forever. It is worth watching at least once."
4,SUSAN POWTER SPEAKS AND TEACHES FROM EXPERIENCE,"I began using Lean,Strong& Healthy 4 months ago. I began exercising in August 1999 - first with one mile a day walks which led to 4 miles per day. After a few months I felt I needed more and I got it with this video. Susan has been where I am and she is inspiring to say the least. The routine is not difficult to learn, you get a marvelous workout, and she is there encouraging you all the way- showing you how to build a stronger fitness level. If you are serious about getting Lean,Strong& Healthy then buy this video- it will change your life. Another great thing is the different people in the video- they are all different sizes at different fitness levels. They are not all size 3 - they are real people who are working REAL hard at getting healthy."
3,"Good workout, but visually dull and rather boring","If all you're interested in is an aerobics routine to get your heart rate up for 30 minutes or so, this is a great routine. I found it too repetitive and boring for my tastes (having been a dancer). The drab colors on the people and the spartan environment don't inspire or energize, either. People who prefer a serious and exercise-class feel to their workouts would probably like this video a lot."
3,I'm changing my dog's name to 'Piranha',"My mini-dachshund Bella is cute and cuddly but her nick name is 'The termite' -- she's an unstoppable toy destroyer. After reading the reviews of the ballistic nylon toys by Bamboo I thought 'finally something she can't destroy in ten minutes flat'. The toy arrived, perfect size, not too big, not too heavy, not too thick for her. Bella played fetch for ten minutes happily running after the little kahuna. Eventually her little legs got tired so she settled down to chew on her little kahuna... it took less than five minutes for her to gnaw through the trim binding the edge ... another toy bites the dust... Maybe a dog with a larger bite can't get the correct angle to get a grip on the edging but my little termite can... and her tiny little teeth are sharp! Disappointing. We'll probably let her play with it again, but keep it out of reach when we're not actively fetching it. As a fetch toy excellent, just not as durable as I'd hoped..."
2,Gold Toe is destroying a premium brand - quality is an issue,I bought a dozen black dress socks made in china and after 5 washes a hole appears in seam. Feel and fit are as expected.I am long time customer who bought GoldToe socks exclusively a dozen at a time. Why they are destroying their brand with inferior quality products made in china or without proper quality controls? I never had a issue paying a premium price for what WAS a premium product. Quality does matter.
1,Black to brown.,The last half dozen Gold Toe socks that I bought have turned from black to a deep brown after one washing. Very annoying. No problem with the older ones.
3,So so,"I dont know exactly why, probably reviews, but I expected a thicker sock. Its a good all around thin dress sock."
1,"Seemed to work almost ok, but..","The lamp worked ok at the beginning, even though the wire was loose and it would lose contact and make the light flicker every once in a while. However it completely stopped working after ~1 week. We're going to see if it's fixable, but it's a pain! You think you solved a problem and you find another one.."
4,under cabinet light,"I was expecting a fluorescent fixture using the common 18 inch bulb which has a diameter aprox that of a penny. This bulb is much thinner, more like that of a AAA penlite battery. However, I am not disappointed because the brightness seems to be at least as high as the one I was expecting. Only hope this new tube does not turn out to be difficult to find for replacement.Jimmy"
2,Don't last long,"Bought two lamps in November 2009. One died on Sep 24 2010, the other one today Jan 21, 2011. The bulbs are still good, the cords are still good, the casing seems good, but probably the starter went bad, it glows red a bit at the edges.I was very happy with the lamps while they worked, they buzzed a little until they warmed up, but they were bright, light, easy to mount, daisy-chain-able, and all-around comfortable. If I knew how to replace or fix the starter, I'd probably still be happy with it, but lasting a year on average I'm not. Please comment if you have a small fluorescent lamp recommendation to try."
3,why does it always got to be about sex,"I liked this book and I found it well written. what I didn't like was how Alanna went from being a nice well kept girl to a trampy warrior. Before you read this I want all you guys to know that if you wanted action or good fantasy you won't get it. Basically she discovers her female self and begins ""mating"". Thats all good but you can discover your self and remain classy. So, dear Alanna, I am very dissappointed in you. Hopefully you'll remain your daring self, but get some more class!"
3,This book kind of angered me . . .,"This book made me mad! Well, I guess I'm one of those people who doesn't like change all that much. The second book left me all happy, Alanna going off, but promising to return to her Prince (ok, so I like books that end with ""and they lived hapilly ever after,"" so what). I guess I thought George would get over Alanna, and everything would turn out the way I planned with countless adventures along the way. I always just thoght Alanna and Jon were ""meant for each other,"" but then Johnathan had to go and get all spoiled and weird! ERRRRGG!! Well, it was an ok book, but STILL!"
1,It's not even worth it's price in PaperBack,"I looked forward to reading The Woman who rides like a man, because I had so enjoyed Pierce's previous novels. Part of the enticem ent to continue reading a book, however, is an identification with the characters. In this case, there wasn't any. There was none forthcoming. Instead, I kept on wishing they would use their native intelligence, rather than pure emotion (or in Pieces's world, the scent or essence of emotion). I actually kept on reading just to see if they would come to their senses!! I was keenly disappointed, and in the end, their fates did not concern me. That is the ultimate failure of the novel."
2,The Dragon Lady,"What a shame. The author created a story with so much potential and just threw it into the trash. It was a great idea, to make a woman knight, but the heroine that started out so strong and likable turned into a person with low morals that jumps from one man's bed to another. What sort of heroine is that?This series started out so well. The first book was great, and kept you at the edge of your seat. But in the second book, she started to sleep with men, and in this one it only got worse. I'm sorry that it did.The story, apart from the dissapointing romance, was quite good. I enjoyed reading about the Bazuir ( yes, I know I didn't spell it right ) .I'm sorry to say that because of the HEROINES bed-hopping that I can only rate this book 2 stars out of 5."
3,"Some good stuff, but a lot of mush","I am in charge of packing the food for my sister and I each Spring and Fall for ten days in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I started drying our own food after the first trip (up to 15 now).I rate a book about back-country cooking by how many pages have corners turned down. I did turn down quite a few as I read through this book, but I didn't make any of the recipes for our latest trip. Why? I would think the food sounded really good, but then I would read about chopping/blending the food so every ingredient was the same size, dehydrating it, and then later putting it in a pot and stirring. How could that not be mush, mush, and more mush?Of course Yaffee has recipes for things other than main dishes, but I really don't have room or weight for bars or cakes. I do have on my agenda to try Yaffe's crackers and some of her recipes did make me think of recipes to try with individual dried ingredients in camp. So not a total wash."
4,Gourmet?,"I received this as a gift, so I'm not sure how timely it arrived. Since it's winter I wanted to get some things made up and tasted BEFORE I hit the trail. Nothing sucks more than finding out how bad a recipe is on the trail. It's a good book with some good ideas. So far I'm about 50/50 with the recipes. But the bad 50% I'll either make some personal changes w/ (i.e. green peppers instead of mushrooms kind of stuff) or just use ones I already know I like. I recommend it, if anything it'll save you $ from buying the store stuff!"
1,Don't Buy!!,"These cards have been marked, and the marker has bled onto the face and backs of the cards, so that from the backs the cards are not identical. Possible uses for the cards: stick into your bicycle spokes to make it sound like a motorcycle..."
4,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"This book was good and was breath taking, but the margins were big."
3,I thought it was a great idea.,I thought it was a great idea. Til I placed my ties in them. The ties tend to get loose in these containers & not hold it well. The cap falls off when turning to place tie inside. Wasn't the greatest purchase & neither was the price I paid for them.
3,Get it if you can not afford any thing better...,"Okay. With no english translations at the bottom, how are you supposed to know what you are singing about? Get the G Schirmer version. Its much better. However, if this is all you can afford then I say by all means go for it.~Adele"
5,Can't go wrong with Canon!,"I got one for my G9, and is exactly like the one shipped with the camera. May be little pricey, but it will serve you right for years to come. From what I heard, the generic batteries, although lot cheaper, have shorter life and even design problems meaning they will poorly fit in the battery compartment of your camera. And is made in japan!"
1,Not the product pictured,"I ordered this item based on the photo shown on the Amazon website. What I received is a knockoff version that is not labeled by or made by Canon. This product has been misrepresented and I am very disappointed that Amazon was not aware of this. Warning to the wise, don't buy this."
3,Average at best...,"Russ Miller is an excellent drummer, with a distinguished resume. However, this DVD is average at best. I'm surprised that it was created in 2003, because the directing, camera work, and organization of the DVD are lacking. At times, the camera work felt more like a low budget music video, as opposed to a professional instructional DVD. Experienced drummers will be able to get something out of the DVD, but I was hoping for a little more insight. I think the premise is that you already own the book, Drum Set Crash Course, so you can follow along with the DVD. This offering could have been much better if Russ had worked with Hudson Music. There are many other instructional drumming DVDs that I would recommend over this one."
2,"Poorly designed, falls apart in use",Not up to the usual Zyliss standards. Chops well but likely to come apart (not break) while in use.
2,Not as good as Pampered Chef,"I was totally disappointed in this chopper. The base is too small, the blades are not that sharp. I really wish I had just bought another Pampered Chef."
4,A GREAT CHOPPER,This is a very good product. I like to make a salad to snack on and this beats using a knife and clean up is so easy. Sturdy also.
1,BIG Mess,"I had a great little chopper years ago, but this wasn't it. First problem: doesn't chop well. Pieces get stuck in the blades and they're big ...not nice little dice. Next, it was hard to clean . Once taken apart (hard) it was a puzzle to put back. In fact I gave up, and threw it in the trash. Only plus: Nice plastic. Try another brand."
3,"use better vinyl, guys","This is a pet album of mine - I had the original, with the tri-fold cover (which is not reproduced here), in 1969 and also own the CD. This reissue disappoints me. First of all, the vinyl is regular weight, not the audiophile pressings we expect at these prices. There is way too much snap, crackle and pop, and amazingly, a SKIP on the last track on Side One. I was mortified, and there's no guarantee that a replacement would be any better after the hassle of sending it back. Also, the original was never known for great sound, but if this one was remastered, they could have fooled me. I figured they could make it sound a LITTLE better with today's technology. I expect better from Sundazed, who are always bragging about their quality, sometimes justifiably. Please use a little more care with some of these things, guys."
2,Very disappointing,"I thought I was getting K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer but instead this was nothing more than packets of hot chocolate mix to add to my hot water. I don't need a special brewer for this and the chocolate is the same as if I'd bought the regular Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix. Granted, Ghirardelli makes really good hot cocoa but don't spend the extra money just because the description says ""specially designed for Keurig"".I haven't tried them yet, but Green Mountain has recently come out with real hot cocoa K-Cups. I just ordered a box from another website and if Amazon carries them later, I'll let you know if they're good."
1,Marketing Ploy,Thanks for the reviews......I almost bought this product thinking it was k-cups.You can actually buy the Ghiradelli hot chocolate in a can from most grocery stores AND it is much cheaper.Wonder how many people got scammed??Thanks to those who took the time to review the product. Saved me some $$$$
2,Poor quality,"The packaging was dirty with dust, both outside and inside the box. Product inside appeared to be old and lacked flavor."
2,I waited for this?,"I am a big Star Trek fan and have been waiting for this novel and it has been a big letdown. It is supposed to take place after the Voyager episode, ""Endgame"". One of my biggest pet peeves is when the author said it took Voyager a week to reach Earth. In the last episode Voyager emerged very near earth and there is no way it would have taken it a week to reach it. After that part the book kept going down hill. Starfleet acted as if it was no big deal that they returned, and didnt particularly seem interested in 7 of 9 or the Doctor. Overall it could have been far better written."
3,Not Bad,"I read a few reviews on Amazon before I bought this book and I have to say that some were overly critical. If you've ever read a Star Trek book before you know they exist for pleasure, not literary excellence. This book is no exception. It reads alomost like its one of the better Voyager episodes (there weren't very many). There is a little more complexity to the story with more sub plots than an episode but it was easy for me to picture this on the screen as I read it. If you are a fan of the show and are curious to know the official story of what happens to the crew once they arrive home then you should enjoy this book. It was a quick read though (I read slow) so if you want to get your money's worth vs. your time, you might consider just picking this up at the library."
3,"Okay, missed a major point out however","The book is an okay one, entertaining certinatly, the people complaining about the Doctor being kept in a cell, obviously failed to read it, Janeway actually got starfleet to turn him back on and put him in a cell, rather then deactivating him, the more sensible option WAS their first choice. No the major inaccurately that kinda made this a 3 and not a 5 star? the borg plague, this ancient plague left over from chocrane's Time, when in fact, isn't that what the Borg Queen wanted seven's help in designing a year or two ago? overal, a good entertaining book, good enough to be canon? No."
1,A Extreme Disappointment,"I love Christie Golden's writing (esp. her ""Seven Of Nine"" novel and her novels for the ""Buffy The Vampire"" series) but, sadly, because she is an obvious Janeway/Chakotay fan, it bleeds into her writing, and she ignores established Voyager canon. Ms. Golden should have re-watched ""Endgame"" (as well as ""Human Error"") before writing this book, which is no more a satisfactory ending to Voyager than ""Endgame"" was...even less. Thankfully, especially in this case, Trek novels aren't considered canon to the show. It's obvious Ms. Golden has merely entertained her own fantasies, which belong better in fan fiction than a published novel."
5,Great album,This is a must-have for any reggae fan and not only. I personally listen to metal and I find this album as lifting as one of my favorite speed metal cd's. If you've ever thought about listening to reggae then this is a cd you should definetly have. My personal favorites are Everyday Good and No Excuse but Fear Rules and You Always You are also very good songs. Perfect album for a long drive or just to chill to.
4,Sticks to his roots,"i'm a big reggae fan, but mostly stick to the classics, bob marley, alpha blondy and such. most new stuff seems too commercialized and pumped up to get into main-stream pop. this record from patrice really sticks to the basics. i've seen him play live and he sounds just like on the cd. there's some really heart-felt lyrics and the cd flows nicely, with out you feeling like skipping a bunch of songs. i would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes more classic, slow reggae-roots music. those that are into to bounty killer, beanie man and such might find it too slow. over all, very enjoyable."
2,overrated,"I don't know why this album gets the props it does. there doesn't seem to be any point where the production or the emceeing tries to grab you....and yet this is heralded as not only a classic, but by many people as the greatest hip hop album ever. It's nowhere near an Illmatic, The Infamous, Stress The Extinction Agenda, 93 to Infinity, any Kool G Rap' early to mid 90's stuff, Stunts Blunts & Hip Hop, Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde etc, etc, etc...it doesn't even come close to 36 Chambers. I think this album is boring."
1,"this album, all I can say is, SLAM IT SLAM IT SLAM IT","This album was pethetic; the only thing that kept me awake while listening to this album was the Oriental flicks that were used that are in all of the WU-TANG albums. I like everyone in the CLAN except GZA. He aint no genius, he a dump **** that cannot rap and the only reason he is in the group is because he grew up with the CLAN members. The only other guys that are descent are U-GOD AND MASTA KILLA (who rarely raps in the WU-TANG albums and makes you wonder if he is really in the group). All of the other members are PHAT AND HAVE THE LYRICAL SKILLS. They ought to just dumb GZA, THE DUMMY from their group."
5,ESSENTIAL REPRESENTATION OF EARLY WU TANG!!!!,"this is one of the best wu tang solo efforts. the beats are razor sharp, and the lyrics wonderfully compliments the beats. the flow IS like a liquid sword if you think about it. this is best heard with the volume all the way up!!!!"
2,Not Pierce's best,"I've read and loved all Pierce's books, but this series reads like it was a struggle to write. Too much plot without action, too many names and characters, unconvincing characterization, and severe moral ambiguity. Difficult to really get behind a spy hero in this day and age, particularly one orchestrating a revolution that kills innocents. If you're new to Pierce, try another series first. My favourites are Protector of the Small and Circle of Magic."
4,Alex's Review,"I liked this book because it was funny and there was a lot of action. The spying and battle parts, I liked too. This is the first book in a series.Alianne, Aly daughter of George Cooper and Alanna The Lioness, is captured by pirates in the spring. They shave her head and bring her to the Copper Isles, where she is sold as a slave to the Balitangs. The Balitangs are sent into exile by the Prince and Aly goes with them. Kyprioth, a raka god, makes a wager with Aly. If Aly can keep the children alive until the end of summer, he'll send her home. The Balitangs oldest daughter will be the next queen except her three-year old cousin is on the throne. After Aly decides if it the last thing she does she will help her onto the throne, Aly's father comes to the Balitangs. Will she want to go home?Girls in fifth grade or up will like this book. If you like fantasy, medieval, spying work or you're a Tamora Pierce fan you will also enjoy this book."
5,"Once again, Tamora Pierce surprised me.","Once again, Tamora Pierce has created a enthralling addition to her Tortall books. Alianne, daughter of Alanna the Lioness, sets out on an adventure with the wager of the Trickster god to protect a family in the Copper Isles. Delightful characters, much interesting spy work learned from Alianne's father, and a handsome crow man keep the story interesting. I must admit, you really should read all the other books first, if you dont, it ruins many things that you may not want to know just yet. THough I did hope to see more of previous characters, Pierce does a fine job without ruining the series of books. Pat yourself on the back Tamora!P.S - I cant wait untill Trickster's Queen! Why, oh why, does it have to be in September?"
5,A Really Wonderfully Written Book!,"Whoever reads this book will be so stunned, that they will not be able to stop reading before they finish it!!! Ally is running away from home when she is captured by pirates. Her father is second in charge of her country's spy network. Her mother is the legendary ""Lady Knight"" It is a fiction book based on history, and the present. You'll re-read it again and again..."
3,Great Teenage Fiction,"Perfect book for the imaginative teenager and lover of books. Good character development and interesting plot to create a page-turning book, up to the standards of Tamora Pierce. This books continues adventures in Tortall, with a new generation of characters, building upon a great fantasy world Pierce has created with earlier works."
5,Great memories,"This compilation brings back great memories of the early 90's and the genesis of more contemporary Christian music. I especially love ""Snake in the Grass"" by Kim Hill, who has an amazing voice!!"
4,Decent stand.,"I've had this product for nearly a year now. I bought it to house my 20 gallon tall tank on the top and a 10 gallon tank on the bottom. At first when I put it together I didnt really trust putting a 20g tank full of water on it, because it is sort of wobbly. But it's held my tank for an entire year with no problem whatsoever. It's a nice unit, and the bottom shelf feature is awesome. I got mine for way cheaper, so I'm not sure about the current price, but yeah good product if you need a cheapish stand."
3,Some of the white cotton lining was not attached to the sheepskin but...,"Some of the white cotton lining was not attached to the sheepskin so I had to sew it and it won't hold because I think it was just a defect but I love the sheepskin so much. I sent a note to customer service just so they would know, but have not heard a reply of ""Thanks for the info"" but I am going to just keep this one until it completely comes apart. I will say that it is wonderful to have it over your steeting wheel and is worth the price. I just hope they take care of the defect in sewing.Thanks!"
3,good price and color but poor fit,"I was really excited to find this since this matches my interior perfectly. The main problem I have with this is that it doesn't fit the steering wheel as perfectly as my previous steering wheel cover. There is a pretty big gap between the edge of this and the steering wheel, it just doesn't snug to the steering wheel. Kind of disappointing."
3,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered a gray steering wheel cover and guess what I got? A black one. This is the 2nd time this has happened when I ordered from them. I don't want to send it back because I will have to pay return shipping fees. Black isn't a bad color to have, but it wasn't what I ordered."
2,Less than anticipated,"The sheepskin is too ""skinny"", as in not plush. Bunches up and slides on the wheel in a turn. Returning."
5,Compact and Beautiful Book,"This well-laid out book is profusely illustrated with color photographs that are well integrated into the easy to read text. The text focuses on the cultural and mythological context of the artworks discussed. Small, but packed with information and illustrations, it is a great book for travelling."
1,NDE,"Near death experience.....I would like a clear diffenition of these words.Four years ago I died in a horse riding accident, it is recorded that I was dead (not near death) for at least 28 minutes....When I had recovered enough, in 9 months, I went on an expedition to find others that had experienced what I had....I ask others that had claimed to have died what was the nature of their experience, without first revealing mine. In all the people I had spoken with and emailed I only found 2 persons that could accuratly describe what the other side is like.....complete with the feelings, sights, music, smells,....As all of us are different, and we are the sum of all of our own experiences....then each one of us has a different experience????? I keep focused on my quest, but I did not find this book of help to me."
1,This woman is really very mentally ill,"IT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR TO SEE FROM THIS BOOK AND THE REVIEWS HERE, THIS WOMAN IS VERY MENTALLY ILL AND BELONGS IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION/HOSPITAL FOR THE MENTALLY ILL/INSANE AND FOR HABITUAL LYERS! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SHE SAYS IS THE TRUTH. EVERYTHING IS A LIE. SHE TALKS ABOUT LEVELS AND SO MANY OTHER FALSE AND MISLEADING LIES! SHE IS EITHER TOTALLY INSANE OR A HABITUAL LIEROR BOTH! HER BOOK IS TOTALL NONSENSE AND A TOTAL FABRICATION THAT SHE PULLED OUT OF SOME PUBLIC TOILET SHE VISITED! PLEASE IGNORE EVERYTHINGSHE HAS SAID! IT IS ALL A TOTAL LIE AND SUPER GROSS STUPIDITY AND SUPER GROSS INCOMPETENCE!"
1,What a disaster!,"I ordered this in hopes of using it with my elementary general music classes, but there is nothing on this CD to even remotely suggest that it is from the Philippines! A solo guitar rambles through various tunes that could be from anywhere. Very misleading marketing led me to this worthless purchase."
4,the mighty quinn,Anything with Denzel Washington is a Plus for me but this is one of my favorites that he was in; HUGE FAN.
4,Good Film,i Really enjoyed this Film.Denzel Washington&Robert Townsend really Click here.Sheryl Lee Ralph Is Great as always&SHe Looks Fantastic.She is Very Underrated.A Good Solid Cast&Story Line.
4,A must-have for a Knopfler fanatic,"If you're a Knopfler fanatic like me, you need to get this little CD. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that you're paying good money for only 3 songs (the first song is just an edit of the title track of Sailing to Philly). The remaining three songs are LIVE, from various TV appearances, I believe. What's unique about them is that there's NO audience noise and the backing is very spare. ""Baloney Again"" is a huge highlight, with wonderfully quiet and nuanced singing, and ""Going Home"" somehow sounds beautiful to me even though I've heard it in a million versions. So if you're a casual fan, save the bucks, but if you really love Knopfler, I'd shell out the cash to get these great alternate versions. They're not just rehashes of the album versions, believe me!"
5,AN ORIGINAL THRILLER THAT HAD ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT,"I can't believe that this movie wasn't released theatrically. It was one of the best thrillers I've seen in years and was full of great suspense. With so many predictable movies out there, it's nice to see something that actually surprised me with really good plot twists. Til Schweiger was just amazing - - a real ""career maker"" for him."
4,Not very Responsive,"I've already apologized for my miserable luck at keeping fish and other domestic animals alive ...I've admitted I'm no good with pets ...so stop pestering me already. When this ""fresh whole rabbit"" fad caught on, I asked myself, ""Could this be the solution to my decades-long run of defunct critters?"" And it was. But be warned, I would categorize this little rodent as ""less responsive"" than most pets. It seems to be most obedient with the ""Stay!"" command.Pets with heads are overrated."
1,Totally NOT a Human Organ,"What a bloody rip-off! From the photo, I thought I was ordering a fresh, whole human kidney! ""Ma'am, we don't sell human organs,"" Amazon customer service tells me. ""We are not interested in trafficking in body parts."" Harumph. So I tell the nice young man on the other end of the phone, ""And why not? Amazon sells everything else!""Alas, now I'm stuck with this ""rabbit."" Sigh. I don't imagine THAT is going to get my neighbor to stop stealing the newspaper off my doorstep. Not like a fresh, whole human kidney would have...Ah well. Good thing this is entirely a work of fiction."
4,Convenient and tasty too,So much more convenient than catching your own. And these are so much better than the ones i used to receive from ACME. I prefer to always have one in the freezer just in case company unexpectedly stops by. I don't tell them what they're eating until afterwards and they're both pleasantly surprised and impressed by my culinary expertise.Wiley Coyote
1,Don't be deceived--NOT RABBIT,"You used to be able to trust people. Not anymore. It wasn't until this the day that I had canned unicorn for lunch, and fresh whole rabbit for dinner that I became suspicious. I don't have an elite palate, but even my rudimentary senses could detect the similarities in the fare. With my suspicions aroused and the remnants of my ""fresh rabbit"" in hand I entered the DNA lab in my garage. 30 minutes later, I emerged crushed by the truth. DNA doesn't lie. That's not a rabbit. That's a baby unicorn."
5,What a combination,"While I'm sure the rabbit tastes fine, I have to wonder... why does the part where Amazon shows what people who bought this item also bought display four enema devices and one teeny tiny thong?I'm kind of horrified."
1,I am horrified,"I am horrified that this picture would appear on a site with Easter toys. I am glad my nephew is young enough to still think the easter bunny still comes to deliver the treats, not to be served for dinner! This is definitely inappropriate, and I will cancel my order with Amazon, and will not order another thing until this is rectified. Selling groceries is one thing, but on a TOY site, come on!"
1,Read the Instructions,"So I thought fresh meant I could eat it out of the box, much like I would fresh apples and pears. Apparently not. After devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box, I have spent the last week in the hospital. Be sure to read the instructions. Apparently you have to cook the rabbit."
2,Where's the fun?,"So, the title ""Fresh Whole Rabbit"" perplexes me a bit. If it was really ""Fresh"" as it is stated, wouldn't it still be alive? This takes the fun out of 'hunting for wabbits' with my collector's addition Elmer Fudd hat on. Instead, you take the thing out of the box and it just lies there. No amount of yelling or making loud noises will scare it away. I give this a two out of five. The fun factor is just non existent for me."
1,Gives you gas and Sharts,"I ordered 23 of these to freeze and feed my in-laws everythime they visit (I laugh and tell them it's chicken) just because I hate them. I was curious one night and boiled one of these things up myself. It gave me the most terrible gas and Sharts. I mean, I had to leave work because I had filled the toilet with brown rabbit stew. The smell of the farts are undescribable. A cross between Death and peanut-butter. The one fart I let while in line at Walmart was so bad---Hiroshima sounded wonderful in comparison. KABOOM! JUS RIKE HIROSHIMA!"
2,"""Not So Fresh"" Feeling","I ordered two of these ""fresh, whole rabbits"" because I thought they would make excellent pets for my kids. Imagine our shock, horror, and disgust when they arrived dead and mutilated. Someone had killed the rabbits, skinned and gutted them, and even cut off their ears!I have ordered a second pair of rabbits, because I can't believe whatever horrible accident befell the first pair could possibly happen again.P.S.: I rated this two stars instead of only one, because we decided to eat the rabbits and they were tasty when sauteed with butter and onions, just like chicken or cat."
3,Good Action With goldberg;s sense of humor is a good combo,"A fast talking smart mouth cop investigates a cocaine ring who specalizes in a lethal form of cocaine and sells it to the highest bidder. Basically what the viewer has here is the female version of BEVERLY HILLS COP With Goldberg having the same dialouge Eddie Murphy had. The violence and bloodflow never stops from the opening scene right to the climatic finale. The best part was the massive shoot out in the mall. The film has one weak point Sam Elliot, wasn;t really convincing as a bodyguard who ends up falling for Goldberg. Whoopi Goldberg pulled off a very funny genuine performance. The film is worth seeing and is much,much better than BURGLER realased the same year."
5,Helluva Ride!,"Hardwired is one of the seminal cyberpunk novels. It ranks alongside Gibson's Neuromancer and Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I first read it right after it was published during the '80s. It was a thrilling story back then and the same is true today. It's a classic that has heldup splendidly over time.I do have a complant about the Kindle edition though. The Kindle text is riddled with errors. Spelling errors, formating problems, spacing mistakes, et cetera. The conversion process to the ebook format was very sloppy. It's still a very good, well written, superbly enjoyable, tightly paced and written story; but the sloppy editing in the conversion to the Kindle format was rather annoying and I'm disappointed by that."
2,I am disappointed,I have been a fan of Peter for a long time but the overnight pop work on this album is lazy and has a definite expiration date. Sorry Peter.
3,Clunky-feeling,"Although these boots were so cute, they just felt heavy and clunky on my feet. Heel-to-toe step seemed too much like work. Knew I wouldn't wear very often and if I did, not for very long, so decided to return."
2,Where are the icons?,"As an Orthodox Priest, I did not agree with Nouwen. He does not give correct information about the icons he is reviewing. He is not qualified to interpret icons."
5,"Praying with icons: wordless truth, beauty, and intimacy","As a Protestant minister, I learned how to be a ""wordsmith"" and pray nice things. But in this book the author opened up a new--though ancient--dimension of prayer. This is prayer without words, prayer that focuses on being in God's presence rather than performing in God's presence. I found myself using the right side of my brain to touch and feel what was holy--a divine mystery. In the meditation on the icon of the Holy Trinity, we are invited to spend time ""living in the house of love"". This involves putting one's self into the picture, that is, sitting with the trinity and experiencing God as loving presence. Nouwen leads us through his experience, like a trusted guide showing the way, while encouraging us to walk the trail ourselves. With four beautiful colored illustrations, it's a gift you need to give yourself--but one that's hard to resist giving to others!"
5,Great old movie with Ernest Borgnine,"I loved watching Willard(1970). Such classic actors and actresses.Compared to the sequel, Ben, which was like a made for TV movie. Highly recommend Willard.Sandra Locke was great. This was before she married Clint Eastwood. Elsa Lanchester was Academy Award winning material!That old house was way cool.Crispin Glover was extremely creepy in the remake. This is the best of the bunch. A slice of history."
2,Smells,"I have been using this product for years and have LOVED it. I don't know if they changed the ingredients recently but I can't even wear this on my face, no less under my nose because of the way that it smells. The product was sealed and is not expired...???"
5,A 'must read' for trainees and practioners in regional anes,"With the recent resurgence in regional anesthesia and the increase in courses in regional anesthesia techniques, this book fills an important aspect of practice not usually addressed. I was introduced to this important area with a lecture of this topic by Dr Finucane himself in a Bombay conference on anesthesia. In this book he highlighted an important idea that is lacking in most regional anesthesia training programs all over the world - that complications and its treatment ought to be taught at the beginning. The chapters were well organised, laid out and explanations simple and well explained. The areas covered were very comprehensive covering Obstetric, Acute and Chronic Pain Management involving various aspects as anatomy, physiology, pathology and management as well as prevention. I would like to congratulate Dr. Finucane and his contributors for this book."
2,geometry workbook,covers good material but the only solutions are to the examples. the follow up problems after the example do not have solutions. i was disappointed by that.
5,A must for NYC tourists!,"Wow - do I wish I had this video before my first trip to NYC. As a southern girl visiting the Big Apple, I was fearful of getting lost, or worse, ending up in a bad part of town. The NYC transit system is essential to get around the city - but also somewhat intimidating and confusing. Ms. Storey is obviously a seasoned traveler and gives an excellent ""big picture"" view as well as details of the transit system. Don't leave for NYC without it!"
1,Complete waste of time,"A totally amateur made DVD. It really doesn't tell you much about blue water cruising, but at least you get 15 mins of some mealy-mouthed couple talking jiberish about their boat. This DVD is way overpriced and is about as sophisticated a production as my kids' skateboard videos..."
1,Bad Disc Nightmare!,"Last month I had to return a copy of The Partridge Family Second Season DVD to Amazon.com. The reason was that disc 2 and 3 didn't work. Disc 1 worked fine though. The replacement set Amazon.com sent me is even worse. Disc 1 and 3 don't work and disc 2 has no video and choppy audio. All my other dvd's (and I have a lot of them) still work in my player. This is the only Sony dvd set I own, however. Is anyone else having problems??? Or is this just my bad luck?"
3,Decent subwoofer overall...,"This is a quality sub that performs well and i have experienced no problems with it. I am a little disappointed however, it doesn't have the mind blowing power that one might expect from such an expensive model. Generally, all alpine products i own have lived up to their hype, but i don't notice a big difference between this sub and the one i replaced, which was a sony explode medium range model. I assumed that this alpine would blow away the older sony explode but in reality, i can't notice a lot of differences. I think that this alpine is built well and should last a long time. If i was asked to pay the retail price of 200$ for this model however, i think i would look into buying a different sub."
1,Good film - Bad DVD,Watching this DVD is like watching a video tape :there is only the movie with no removable subtitlesThere is absolutely nothing else on this DVD (there is no menu!!)It's really a shame for a DVD (above all for this price)
1,"Display is to bright, you cannot sleep with it as an alarm clock","Do not buy this ipod dock, The display is too bright. You cannot dim the diplay soft enough to sleep. The dimmer has two settings, too bright and even brighter. I had to unplug the thing. It has a sleep timer and alarm, but who cares. You cannot sleep. You ( really ) can do hand puppets. Then sound is very good."
5,Outstanding scholarship written for the common reader.,This is a classic written in the scholar's final years and published after his death. A man of higher criticism that came to conservative conclusions after a life of teaching and research. A must for the serious student of the New Testament.
5,She swept me right into her world-bring on book #2!,"With a blend of euphoric happiness and paralyzing sadness, this love story is one you will not be able to put down. The author's love of her small-town upbringing shines forth and makes one want to seek out the friendly hamlet to find a home for themself. Certainly, we can look forward to a lot more enjoyable reading from Ms. Childers."
3,Pretty good,"This book does not belong to the ""smug married telling us singles how we should feel and act"" category. I'm tired of the implication that there's something wrong with us, that's why we're still single and there's something ""right"" about them and that's why they're married. For that reason alone, this book is refreshing.However, some of her interpretations of biblical passages are a stretch causing me to say, ""Oh, come on..."" a few times. Also, and I don't mean to be low but, her poetry gets to be really, really *grating* after awhile. And having to read them after the end of every chapter (and on some chapters, there are two or three of them!), well one can only take so much. You're left thinking the author is really enamored by her own poetry.But her poems don't enhance. If anything they detract. Which is a shame because the author does have a lot of important things to say once you get past the schmaltz."
1,Birds in China lacks substance,"I had hoped to find a simplified guide (sort of like the U.S. Golden Guides) which would enable me to identify the most common birds I would see on my recent trip to China. I am a fairly good birder in the US, but knew that I would not have the chance to do more than spot really common species in China. This book is watered-down ornithology and of no use as a field guide. The pictures are of poor quality. The ""check list of the birds of China"" is useless, as it does not identify individual species, rather it simply gives the number of species in families.The only other guide I could find is very expensive and heavy -- unsuitable for a traveler. I have not been able to locate what I wanted."
4,Looking forward to the next one.,"Though he's not the flawless hero Jack Ryan from the Clancy novels, Dutch Bennett is a likeable character trying to make the right decisions as he struggles to extract himself from a conspiracy in which he has unwittingly become involved-all the while worrying about his upcoming bar exam. I enjoyed the plot and am looking forward to the further development of this character as the series progresses."
3,For a novelization of a disaster movie...,"The author does a pretty good job. I wasn't that interested in the movie before reading the book, but now I look forward to seeing it. The book provides background information that probably won't be in the movie. It's not classic literature, but it's a good read, nonetheless."
2,georgie228 should check facts,"This book was written and issued as a hardcover five years ago titled: The Coming Global Superstorm; it IS NOT based on the movie. People who do not do even the most basic research before writing reviews probably are also prone to believe in global warming. See Patrick Michaels article in the May 16, 2004 Washington Post."
3,I need to read the book!,"I recently watched this film, and came to the conclusion that I really need to read the book. The movie seemed rushed to me and a bit overly acted out by such great actors.Being an African American woman, I study my history a lot, and that includes all of African American historical regions as well as the Caribbean. I found in this film, many of the facts to be rushed and not explicated well; the reasons behind the ideas and beliefs of the Gen de Colour Libre...reasons that I know vary from family to family.It also did not explain well why Anna Bella was considered ""Black"" as opposed to Creole. I know the reason, but I'm sure most people do not."
2,Feast of a Violent and Disturbing Saints,"I have seen ""Feast of All Saints"" twice and every time it has been harder to watch. I would not recommend this film especially if you cannot stomach violence and graphic images. Overall, it attempts to provide a history lesson, but if you are seeking knowledge of the quadroons & mulatto people of that era pick up a history book with historical facts."
2,Just an OK from me!!!,"For the most part, the movie stays true to the book with the exception of some sequence of events. Not the greatest acting performances and a very ""Hollywood"" interpretation. Frankly, I have never seen a better looking cast with all the beautiful people in this version. For dedicated fans of Anne Rice, stick to the book. For those of you who have a hard time reading Rice and translating visually, you may find this visual easier to grasp."
1,Never received item ordered.,"I own this phenomenal movie and thought it would be a great gift for my friend. Unfortunately, she never received the package.Personally, I would give the movie Feast Of All Saints a 5 star review, but my friend has never seen it. Sorry"
4,I pleased,I'm very pleased with my puchase and amazed with the quickness of how fast I received my dvd.Thanks
3,It's ok,"I was looking for a CD that had music like the movies' trailer, but it does not. None of the music from the ""Ever After"" commercial is on this disk. It is, however, still a very nice disk"
2,Hands stuck on each other - no way to fix,"I returned this style of clock twice for the same defect. I was very disappointed that the quality assurance of this product was not up to par. It should have been very apparent to anyone who tried to start the clock that it was not going to work and that the hour and minute hands were overlapped and unable to perform correctly.To get this identical defect twice in two different clocks is just not acceptable for the vendor. Please make sure that they know this. Even though your returns process is fairly easy, it is still a hassle to give or to get a gift that has to be returned and to wait for another just to find that it, too, has to be returned.We have ordered another clock and purposefully stayed away from this vendor. Sorry to say that I found the other clock $10 cheaper on another website."
5,Awesome clock,"I love this clock and can't wait to put it in my yard. Seems very durable, but since it has yet to be placed outdoors, I don't have outdoor knowledge to share."
1,Behind the studio with Alyson Williams,"I have been privilaged to know Alyson Williams personally. As a recording artist she delivers every element of an R&B singer. Alyson's first two CD's were in excellent timing (RAW - 1989 & Alyson Williams - 1991). Her current work (It's about time - 2004) will not provide the listener the current style which is popular today; Hip-Hop/R&B. Also the CD's production lacks luster and does not provide an orchestrated sound. Alyson's attempt to recapture a style in music's past will not give her the acclaim she so rightfully deserve. Artist's should be diverse, not shocking. Alyson's first major contract with DEF JAM billed her as a Hip-Hop/R&B artist and her third installment should have given her listeners a taste of her past works along with the style she is working on now."
3,Make sure you need this filter before you buy,"I bought the Mr. Heater Hose with a regulator and quick disconnect fitting for the Big Buddy Heater. When it arrived, I discovered that I could not connect the fuel filter to the quick disconnect fitting. I called Mr. Heater, and they informed me that I didn't need the fuel filter if I was using a hose with an attached regulator. It would have been nice if Amazon had indicated this fact when I purchased the filter. But, none of the specifications for the product demonstrated this redundency. If you buy the hose with the regulator, then you don't need this filter."
1,Mr. Heater Fuel Filter,Buyer beware! This item is NOT compatable with the quick disconnect hose & regulator (F271803) that Amazon suggests buying together as accessories for the mr. Heater. Shame on Amazon this time for recommending these together This filter is threaded.
4,got gas? have filter.,"I love this filter, someday in a emergency, I'll have to use it, I'll figure out then how to break into the packaging. right now its a great display case."
2,It's cheap for a reason,"Not long after I bought this bag, the zippers came apart, so almost all those pockets are useless. Also, the proper arrangement of the dual straps is so complicated that it would take a design engineer to figure it out. Don't buy it."
2,Very disappointing,"Yes, she was Lennon's half-sister. It was necessary for to put a family tree in the back of the book to show how she was related to him. When I bought this book I was hoping for a lot of detail about the early years of John Lennon. There were very few surprises. Take a look at the dust cover of the book. It is as though she is trying to look like Lennon with her wire-rimmed specs. And you would have expected many more photos of John with the family from someone claiming to be so close. Save your money."
5,Excellent Film Noir at giveaway price.,"Topnotch quality picture and sound in this DVD film noir,Trapped.Good performances by Lloyd Bridges,John Hoyt and Barbara Payton( She really can act)"
5,Author Speaking,"I'm really sorry about the editing errors. I've contacted the publisher, and they informed me that these editorial errors have been corrected. Recently, I received a letter from them stating that this book has been selected as a candidate to be one of this fall's 'Hardcover Choices'.""Trust In Me"" has been revised. The 'Hardcover Choice' will be done in cloth hardcover, with a dust jacket that carries a cover that's exactly like the paperback version. The hard cloth cover underveath the jacket will be blue, and it will carry the book's title and the author's name on the spine in gold."
3,As years goes by...,"the fascination for the biggest Engineering masterpieces remains.Yamato was one of these masterpieces.If you are an Engineer, probably you will be deceived. It missing lots of very interesting/important details. One of the reasons is no reliable info remains of this ship.On the other hand, if you is a ""typical curious guy/girl"" you will find interesting info on the structure of this ship.Anyway it an interesting book for a glance, not to include in your library as a comprehensive compendium on the subject :-) :-)"
2,Not Exactly What Is Pictured,"The 1st Image(dark gray & pink) IS the actual Single released; however, the 2nd image(white & blue) is the product that is being sold - they ARE NOT the same. The product being sold is a Remix EP done by 20 Fingers, and NOT the actual Album Single(Short D!ck Man, from the album, 'On The Attack') that is the 1st image. It wasn't a total loss(taking into account the extermely low price), but it wasn't what I thought I was getting - most people hate when that happens."
1,Black Emanuelle,"I have always been a fan of Emanuelle films and i would say that the Italian versions are much better, although this is the orginal. Black Emanuelle, Emanuelle around the World and Emanuelle in America are by far the best titles in the Emanuelle series. If you are looking for Emanuelle movies then i suggest you look for Laura Gemser, and not Sylvia Krystal. Believe me this one is not worth it."
5,one of the most influential erotic movies,"This movie is very classic. Sylvia Kristel played this movie when she was around 23 years old. She looks great in this film. Someone may said that its story was boring. I think that he saw so many movies that tried to or recieved the influence from this movie. Finally, I suggest that you buy this moive asap because this movie is one of the greatest erotic movies that man has ever been created."
4,Comfy,I've found these shoes to be quite comfortable. They fit me like a glove and the leather is soft enough.
3,"good quality for the price, but the price wasn't that high","Item was very heavy. Base was straight and it stands well. Colors were vibrant. I just didn't like that there were visible ""bubbles"" in the glass. My husband didn't they were a big deal so maybe I'm just too picky. :)"
3,only half the story,"Amazon's data-entry monkeys did not mention that these 12 episodes are not the full series. This is only the first half of the show's 24 episodes.I'm disappointed that they crammed 6 episodes on each DVD, but I guess it will be slightly better quality than watching it on YouTube fansubs..."
2,Five Star series Zero stars For ADV,"Note to ADV in the future since this has already been available for a long time unofficially subtitled and people could buy the raw japan dvd's why would they buy them subbed only? The advent of dvd unlike vhs meant you could have dual audio releases and this is a waste of the capabilties of the format.To Sum up, Dear ADV no english dub= no sale"
5,Matchless!!!,"Most of the dungeon masters and players hate power play in their games and for this reason they cannot stand Salvatore's Drizzt novels in which the characters are perfect and matchless. However, Richard Baker's Araevin Teshurr is far from being invincible (both physically and mentally). The story is fabulous and Richard Baker has a wonderful writing style. But these are not the only reasons that make this trilogy perfect. Being a game designer, Richard Baker is well aware of the history of Forgotten Realms, races, deities, famous characters, spells and limitations... Hence, he tells his story both as a novelist and a dungeon master.For the first book of the trilogy Forsaken House, Ed Greenwood said ""All-in-all, this is perhaps the best-written Realms novel yet"" and I cannot agree more. Moreover, I believe that this is perhaps the best-written Realms trilogy yet. This is a trilogy that you would want to read more than once."
3,so-so!,"A fair book with good batlles but the overall story left me wanting. Most of it was good, but I am just getting too picky of late I suppose. The second book of the series is better.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."
3,Meh.,"This book was a dissapointment for me. The characters were not fleshed out to any satisfactory level, with some thrown in seemingly just for the purpose of having someone to kill without disrupting the storyline. The villains are not given free reign to be the evil monsters they are painted as, either. Added to that are some boring political discussions and an almost total lack of humour of any kind.In it's defense, the book does have some entertaining battle sequences, and the story gets considerably better near the end of the book. In fact, it got so much better that I will in fact buy the next title in the series when it becomes available. I just hope I don't regret it.For a much more entertaining read, pick up THE RAGE, by Richard Lee Byers. You won't be sorry you did!"
5,"excitement, and intrigue...what a season","when I watched 'Quantum Leap' on the tv it was a great show. so owning the first season seemed like a good idea. I WAS NOT disappointed in the least. It delivers with a knockout punch and continues on. Sam Beckett and his faithful hologram buddy 'Al' have a working relationship unequalled in tv. they keep you guessing on every plot, and make you want to run back for more. Part of you keeps hoping Sam will get home, but part of you knows that then the show would be over, and so would the fun, not to mention all the great changes these two bring about in others lives through time and space.this series is worth the time, and WELL worth the money. If you are a Scott Backula fan, which I am, you'll more than enjoy these dvd's in your collection."
4,"Great Series, Disappointed in Extras",Took way to long to bring this one to DVD. Hoping it won't take as long to bring the other 4 seasons to DVD. Great to see each episode uncut and no commercials. But couldn't they do more extras? Is a small 2 minute clip or less with Scott Bakula talking about each episode all there is to say about that episode? A commentary track would be great for each episode on the next seasons DVDs!!
5,At Last Quantum Leap on DVD,"Oh how long we've waited for this wonderful series to come to DVD and we are not disappointed. Crystal clear pictures, uncut episodes, no commercials - fantastic. Well worth the wait for it to be shipped to the UK and the customs duty that had to be paid! Don't make us wait too long for the rest of the seasons. It's great to see Sam and Al again and hear a little about the making. Would love to see some out takes and extra snippets. Long live Sam and Al!"
3,"Great Show, but why the ridiculus price???","My dad and I both loved this show and were so excited that it was coming out on DVD, but [the price] for 9 shows is outrageous. I don't understand why many of the TV shows coming out on DVD are so expensive. Oh well, we'll just catch the reruns because at this rate it will cost in the neigborhood of $200 for the entire series-RIDICULUS!!!!"
3,Uh-Oh....Good Show...Extreme cost,"Uh-oh. Deja-vu all over again. I won't comment too much on the show itself because anyone looking at this is probably considering buying it or they wouldn't be here reading. Quantum Leap was another of my favorite shows next to Northern Exposure. Unfortunately, like Northern Exposure the first season of Quantum Leap was a late season fill-in that only produced 8 episodes the first season. And like Northern Exposure, this DVD set is overpriced. Shame shame. Taking advantage of paying customers, the companies in charge of distribution should reconsider the cost and how much they may be driving good customers away. 5 stars for the show, 1 for the cost= 3 stars average."
4,Quantum Leap Season one,"Quantum Leap is one of the best sci-fi shows of its time. In fact it was ahead of its time. The series only got better through the rest of its run. It ended far too soon but left an impact that gave a unique style to the concept of time travel. Imagine being able to travel through time but only within the years of your birth and death and only in spirit where your mind is trap in the body of another. Oh...by the way to get home you have to change a moment in the life of that person or person(s) around them. Talk about walking a mile in someone shoes. If you like time travel shows here is another one that inspired many others including the one in this review,The Time Tunnel - Volume One"
3,Where are the files?,"I ordered this to provide replacements for my current Trims. However, the trimmers in this set are missing the nail files. This is evident in the small picture if you look very carefully, which I obviously failed to do. If you do not care about the files, this is a good deal. But if you do, don't buy this item as you will be (as I am) disappointed. Annoyingly, the complete versions of the trimmers are not sold in a set and are usually marked up to an excessive degree."
3,A little disappointing,"Sad to say, this book was disappointing. I thought Homecoming got the Voyager Realunch off to a good start, but this book kind of lets you down. The focus shifts from the characters interacting with familiar friends and relatives on Earth, to an attempt to unearth a coverup at Starfleet regarding the Borg. The B'Elanna ""B""-story was predictable and dull, although it was refreshing because it had nothing to do with the main plot line.The main plot was, however, completely unbelievable. The reason given for ""why"" a Borg virus is spreading on Earth makes no sense.I'm looking forward to more stories in the relaunch, but I'd like to see a return to the style of ""Homecoming"" where there are lots of things happening with different characters all at once."
1,Horrible!,"This toy is by far the most obnoxious toy we have. On top of it repeating the same thing over and over, where is the off button! It was also difficult to get the pieces in."
2,Problems,"This isn't a bad CD, but there are a few things that bother me enough to sharply inhibit possibly enjoying it. For one, it's not really New Age, it's more like Celtic Folk. Pardon my candor, but there's a difference. Most of us who listen to ""New Age"" think of Vangelis, or Tangerine Dream, or the Andreas Wollenweider circle of artists. If you like Celtic style New Age then you might enjoy it. Number two, it's their band name. There is a problem with that name in the industry, with 2 other specific groups who have used that name for many years. Changing the spelling for legal use is very, very cheap. I find that a direct reflection of the kind of group they are. That alone inspires me to put the disc back on the shelf and browse for something else."
2,Innocuous ditties,"Stew's songs (solo and with TNP) vary wildly in quality -- except for the ones found here, which are remarkably consistent. Consistently dull, that is. Try as he might, Stew just can't seem to emerge from Andy Partidge's shadow, let alone Arthur Lee's. Clever lyrics, though, if that still means anything...."
4,Erarsers That Work,The erasers work very well but have fallen out of my pencil. However it is easily fixed by pushing it in harder then normal.
1,Not for 9mm Pencils,I have a 9mm Cross pencil and these are too narrow to fit. I have found some Bic 9mm pencils (plastic semi-disposable kind) and their eraser refills fit my Cross 9mm.
3,Cross refills,Ordered for my husband's use. It is hard to tell what size actually fits the pencil and this was no exception. It worked but had to be shimmed into the pencil in order to stay attached. Wish there was a better guideline on choosing the correct size.
5,"A remarkable, lyrical book full of insight.","This remarkable book betrays a genius for language in a variety of places. Poetic and fast paced, it is as if keats had sat down to write king."
5,I love it.,It works great. Even the first waffle came out good. I discovered that I only needed to set the heat up half way to get perfect waffles. My old waffle iron needed to be set all the way up and you had to throw away the first waffle.It's easy to clean up any spill-over because the grill extends over the base and nothing gets inside or caught in ridges. Actually you can wipe them off while its cooking. Once you get the hang of how to spread the batter there isn't any spilll-over. It beeps when its done so you don't have to stand there and watch it. You can cook up an entire batch very quickly.When you're done the only thing you have to cleanup are the dishes. My father and brother loved the giant waffles (and the dogs enjoyed the leftovers). It's sensational and I am very glad I bought it.
2,Dissapointing,"I expected more, having heard about this CD months before its release, I bought it as soon as it became available and I'm not impressed. Don't buy unless you absolutely have to hear one of the groups. The first Trancemode Express is much better."
1,The worst covers of Depeche Mode songs ever,"I was hugely disappointed, with the effort brought forth by these artists. Aside from the Cure, the songs were boring. There was no energy in any of the lyrics or to the beat of the songs. How could they disgrace such a good band with such a lousy tribute album."
1,D.M. SONGS SOUND BETTER WHEN LEFT TO D.M.,"Being a huge fan of Depeche Mode, I was very excited to hear about this tribute CD. I was even more excited when I found out that The Cure (actually, Robert Smith) and Smashing Pumpkins were to contribute their talents to the album. But when I listened to this CD, I felt like crying. I soon discovered that nobody--not even Robert Smith (my idol)--does Depeche Mode songs anywhere NEAR as well as Dave, Martin, and the others. The artists who play on this CD, although very talented on their own, ruthlessly butchered all of my favorite songs while I helplessly listened, horrified. It sounded like a contest to see whose band could do the most damage to a perfectly good song... if I were in Depeche Mode, I would not be honored at this ""tribute""; I would be insulted. If you have a D.M. itch to scratch, I recommend getting ""Some Great Reward"" or ""Violater"" instead."
4,This record has some stunning songs,"this is far from a perfect album. there are several songs that for whatever reason, dont work. the better tracks, however, are untouchable. I am particularly fond of Failure's version of ""enjoy the silence,"" which might be better than Depeche Mode's original version (probably not). Hooverphonic's ""shake the disease"" is also very strong, as is Veruca Salt's ""Somebody."" Many of the contributing artists are nearly unrecognizable. You will find yourself checking the CD to see who is performing a given song. This record is worth having because some of the songs are so good. These songs far outshine the bad ones."
3,Decent.. if you like covers.,"I'm not a huge DM fan... I'm actually more of a Pumpkin and Cure fan, and that's why I purchased this album. I loved the covers by both the afforementioned bands. Veruca Salt and the Deftones also had fairly good covers. Overall it's not that great, but personally I think it's worth it for tracks 1 and 4 alone. Seems that DM fans don't like this tribute too much, but after I bought this I did go out and buy the double-CD singles record for DM, and liked it. So if you're not in to DM and like the other bands on the record and think you might want to get in to DM, it's worth a shot. Pretend that made sense."
4,Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart's talent showcase,"Some songs you'll never find in other cd's. This cd brings you the best of this incredible duo. If you enjoy Dolenz, jones, boyce and hart it's even better.Some songs are missing like girl I'm out to get you and blow you a kiss in the wind. But it's OK,It's worthwhile."
4,ink cartridge,Sorry the cartridge didn't last long and there wasn't any red ink in it. Sorry about that.
5,ink for older printer,ink for older printer delivered on time in an intact package without delay and works wonderfully and it is time to say that i am wasting space for these reviews so here it is
5,Everyone loves it,I bought this for my children when they were small. Quickly spreading to my nieces and nephews. They all loved it. Now their children and my grandchildren are also loving this DVD. My niece is 27 and is still askingfor a copy for herself.
3,Great for kids,"Although this movie is a couple of years old, it has a good story line and children love the characters. It rivals Barney any day of the week."
5,PRAISES FOR MS. DAWSON!,"Deliah Dawson is strating to become one of my favorite authors. This book starts off as a game and ends like a roller coaster ride, when its over, everyone is extremely SATISFIED!"
5,Top Stuff!! amazing,This EP.. no this group is simly sensational. a totally new style that blows you away with the amazing vocals of lead singer Ben Whitecross. the first track 'Languish' unleashes King Mungi's potential and is by no means all they have to offer on this EP. this Gold Coast based band will defintetly rise to be one of Australias top bands. with Gigs coming up everywhere lately these guys have something to say and they want to be heard. GET IT NOW!!!
5,greatest movie of all time,Best movie Oliver stone ever made....PERIOD. I went to wal mart to buy fear and loathing in las Vegas and bought this instead...definitely worth. It
1,Trash,"that's the one word that can sum this movie up....I hated it...I dont mind violence, but what I do mind is when it's done to the extreme and with a sadistic, very cold blooded tone..and this movie had a LOT of that....nonstop.....if you love watching a woman in a cafe begging for her life before getting a bullet in the head, or a man crawling on all fours in a pharmacy, begging for his life before getting executed, then this movie is for you. I might also suggest you get some therapy. for others, go ahead and watch it, but make sure you have steal wool and bleach to scour yourself with afterward...."
1,Not satire or social commentary but a waste of time,"I am tempted not to give Oliver Stone's disaster of a movie an intelligent review, because he did not bother to give me an intelligent film. Instead, I will be brief, and try not to get upset at the fact that Oliver Stone puts pure drivel on the screen and gets away with it because he once directed a few pretty good films: Regardless of whether this is satire or social commentary, it's a failure. It suffers from exreme overkill and a hideous repetitiveness that renders it almost unwatchable. Stone's not saying anything that hasn't been said a hundred times before, and better--the media glamorizes outlaws, manipulates the public, etc. He's not funny, he's not entertaining, and he doesn't inspire thought on the part of the viewer. Too heavy-handed to be satire, too slow-witted to be true social commentary, this film is a waste of time."
1,I can't see this movie...,"I want to see this movie, but how? The DVD version has problems, it was wrong done. Too bad..."
2,Derivative (the two stars are for Juliette Lewis),"Oliver Stone stole the entire aesthetic of this film (particularly the 1-2 second intercuts of faces and discordant scenes) from New York Photographer and filmmaker Richard Kern (just check out RK's ""Hardcore"" videotape series and you'll see what I mean)."
4,a real stir,"natural born killers is the only movie after pulp fiction that give me real enjoyment. many people don`t like it, but i dont know why? it really has all the expression. . a true story of today`s life."
3,sarcastic,This film means to be sarcastic about public and media hunger for violence in our culture. Any comments other than that about it are missing the point. I wouldn't see it twice though.
1,"Long, boring violence with no plot","This film stole three hours of my life.The plot is simple; Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis (two extremely talented people, I might add)go on a shooting rampage. When I watched this film I had the feeling that we were supposed to like the main characters, but there's something about gun-wielding maniacs that makes me feel uncomfortable. The fact is that I didn't care one way or another about what happened to them, I just wanted to get the damn movie over with."
1,Noo Way!,"Not a good movie. Creepy, weird, hard to understand. Story line was all over the place. Gave me nightmares. Looked to be low quality, just plain BAD."
5,Warning - This movie is deeply violent and disturbing,"This is one of the most haunting movies i have ever seen, It is one of my favorites. Those of you who havent seen this, read the warning above. If you like Tarentino-ish movies like yours truly, than watch it. The riot scene at the end of the movie gives me chills every time I watch it."
5,"This Movie Is A Bad Case Of ""Overkill"" (Literally!!!"")","In this movie director Oliver Stone takes 1 1/2 hours to point out to the viewer that mass murderers can become 'celebrities' via the Media. Gee. I didn't know that. Thanks for enlightening me Mr. Stone.Apart from the fact that this Theme is explored in the movie ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and a host of other films Mr. Stone has little else to say. Given his recent antics perhaps he should consider changing his name to ""Oliver Stoned"". I give this movie 5 stars because thankfully Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis have disppeared from our movie screens in recent years."
3,Not what I expected.,"Not what I expected. Good movie, but I didn't like how it was filmed. If it had been filmed like an actually movie and a little less over the top, I would've enjoyed it more. You can tell it's a Taratino film but I like his stuff, I think Oliver Stone messed it up by re-doing it."
1,It seems to be the sign of a vapid culture...,"...that nobody takes anything seriously. Whether they're other people's opinions or the financial exploitation of cruelty. I respect anyone who enjoyed this movie, and I'm sure that for them it was a sobering warning against young couples who go on killing sprees, TV journalists who take part in prison riots, and girls who seduce men at gunpoint. But, I feel like I should pretend to like it more than I do, just so you'll think it wasn't that good.The changing film stocks make a resounding statement about society. But the red, neon messages projected onto the characters' faces that say things like ""demon"" and ""too much TV"" went right over my head! What was Mr. Stone trying to say here? Much too subtle for me.Maybe if it had said, ""Too many stupid movies""...?"
2,One of the most drastically over rated films of all time,"For some strange reason this film was regarded as a cinematic masterpiece. It has a very average plot of a psychotic couple going on a mudering rampage and having the media making them into celebrities. What image of American society are we supposed to be given here. It lacks originally in scripting, cinematography and directing. The acting isn't anything special either. Also the way they basically made the whole concept of the movie to be a joke was very disturbing (the filmakers, not the movie). Whatever Oliver Stone think he is achieving from this piece of trash is beyond me."
2,moments of smirking depravity and vile intent,"A flamboyant mess of a movie with moments of smirking depravity and vile intent. Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are the lionized mass murderers who escape their half-parodied white trash backgrounds to eventually be captured, only to escape from prison. Stylized grandeur overwhelms the watcher; effective scenes like the killers' brief awakening to humanity with an Indian mystic is lost in a tirade of foul collages and flashing memories. Here the director is indulging his talent but missing the point in doing so."
3,Its only a movie,"I shouldn't be surprised, but it is very notivable that the people who hate this movie seem incapable of differentiating between fantasy and reality.This film is about America's obsession with real-life violence, and the underlying message of it is that no matter how grisly and bloody Stone can make it, its still Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, blank shells and fake blood! Compared to the cult of celebrity attached to real killers and the obsession with seeing 'reality TV - the bloodier and more 'shocking' the better, a mere movie is nothing."
5,It used to disturb me,"The first time I saw this whole movie, I thought that maybe it was a bit too much; killing Mabel, the prison riot, and what have you. It left me feeling icky, wrong, dirty, etc.The next time I watched it, it didn't gross me out as much. What's more, I began to notice other things about the film. I loved the superimposition, all of the weird camera work, Mallory's life as a sitcom, and the satire of serial killers.It's been pointed out before, but this movie plays on the fact that our serial killers in America are, more or less, legitimate celebrities. And it's not all bad for them either. Law enforcement and very adult people denounce them, saying they're disgusting, monsters and whatnot. Kids, on the other hand, are intrigued, and sometimes think they're cool, in a manner of speaking.Also, I liked the twisted love story of Mickey and Mallory. It was touching. Bloody, and vile, but touching.Great movie, hands down. I wish I could give it 8 or 10 stars."
5,HOHNER 2 PIECE MAPLE SOPRANO,"This Hohner maple recorder is surprisingly nice. I like it better than their more expensive ""Concert"" pearwood model, which has a louder, albeit duller quality to it. The tone on this one is more open, and lighter. Like all Hohners,it hits the higher notes quite easily.I would definitely recommend this recorder to anyone looking for something that sounds nice and wants something in wood. I have some expensive recorders, and to tell you the truth, I like this one the best. Good for children and adults, and adults shouldn't think just because this is a ""student"" model (basic shape, design) that it's inferior. It sounds just lovely!"
4,"nice recorder, not the best in the world","I've been playing the soprano recorder for many years. Lost mine and decided to buy a new one. This had excellent reviews and i went for it. It's definitely not as nice as the one i lost. The pitch is a bit sharp, needs to be more mellow, not so sharp. Overall i'd say good for the price, and for those who are basically starting out with the recorder."
1,Ink Sucker,Used it almost exclusively for scanning. Still had to replace the ink regularly. Now the black ink stopped printing all together. I won't buy another Brother.
2,noisy and slow,"i received it today, but it was a little broken in transportation. first look is noisy & slow.i'm waiting new one.."
2,The worst printer,"I read the reviews and I have to agree with the one that were having problems with the ink being out (according to the printer) and still having more than half the ink left. What I hated was the Brothers website did not address this problem,especially when so many people were having the same problem"
3,Good value,I bought this printer for my home network. You really can't beat the price of this one. Just the network interface would have costed more than the full price of this printer alone. It certainly does not have the best print quality nor built for heavy duty use. But it works great for a home network.
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this machine and thought it was the cheapist quality in a MFC around.I an an uneasy feeling right away when I took out the paper tray and saw this cheap plastic bar that you had to squeeze to have the paper fit in. If you wanted to change the paper size, you could barely get the sides to move back.Low & behold when I went to print out notecards on standard card stock, it wouldn't even grasp the card! The little wheel just spun around and around and couldn't grasp the card to feed it up into the printer.It went back to the store because I cannot deal with spending money on something I know I'll hate.I bought a Canon Pixma MP760 and feel like I own a Cadillac!!!Stick with Canon, my 10 yr. old one is still working!"
2,Do Not Buy,"As usual the product is quite intuitive as will all Brother's product. The software that runs the product is quite easy to understand and use but the hardware is poor. It is quite flimsy. Further, not sure that anyone else has had the problem, but the fax works less than 10% of the times I have tried it. Since I have vonage, I assumes that it was my connection that was the problem, but when I put my other Brother fax on the same line and connection, it worked without promlem every time."
1,Be careful of the fine print,"I purchased this software and when I tried to load it on my PDA's, I got an error message that said the program could not read the serial number of my device. After trying to load the software on a DELL Axim X5 and a Toshiba E335 PDA and getting the same error, I contacted EIDOS support who promptly told me to read the specifications on the package and if my device was not mentioned on the box then it would not work. So buy the game if you have one of the supported devices."
1,Useless to Everyone,"This is an incomprehensible book that makes a coy and embarrassing attempt to distance itself from the Kabbalah, even though that is it's only possible explanation or reason for existence. Unless you have some sort of psychic connection to the author, this book will be useless to even an accomplished student of Kabbalistic interpretation since the author apparently has his own ideas on the subject which he chooses to keep to himself and leaves the reader to flounder in a sea of pseudo-magick word counting. It is a sterile abomination that brings no illumination to Crowley's masterpiece. Just another hack author trying to cash-in on The Master's name. A waste of pulp and ink."
3,"Great idea, needs some design revisions","Very easy to install, could use a gap in case you would like to sink the cord. The controls for timing and lighting are terrible--it seems like one end MAY (MAY!) have a small arrow--but one can not be sure so it is a crap shoot when you try to set the timings. The ""directions"" are useless. Once you get done the guessing games it is a great product, just expect to spend a few more hours setting and testing out different settings than you expect to. We set up three units with three different settings to get the same result, by the way. Now I love them though i did photograph each setting for future reference :)"
1,Beware this is not the real security/flood light solution,"As others state it is easy to install. the catch is the cord which helps avoid running a new hardwired electrical line. My issue is it suggest not placing the light over 9-feet high. I did not note that on the package before I bought it. I initially placed mine about 12-feet and the motion detectors did not pick up squat. I lowered mine to about 8-feet, still no motion detection. It only picks me up when i'm 2 feet away on the ladder installing it. I'm going to play with it one more time, if i can't figure out the motion sensitivity it's going back! As someone else posted the instruction are worthless."
1,Horrible,This has never worked like it is suppose to..I even recommended this to a friend...It did work for a couple weeks...just long enough for the warranty to expire.Go to walmart..there is one semilar to this..with plug in
4,May be Lightening sensitive,"This is my second cooper light.The frist worked fine until we had a lightening storm and then it would not shut offanymore. I ordered another because I liked the first one however, if its that susceptable lightening I will not buy another"
5,GOOD,I haven't been able to sit and read this cover to cover because I have 4 kids. One of them is being tested for SPD. This book has a lot of info and I can flip through it and find checklists and other information that is helpful.
5,Ebook,"This book is very helpful. It helps me with the students I work with, I cannot diagnose students with sensory issues, but it gives me some ideas try try. I love ebooks because there is no waiting time."
5,The Out-Of-Sync Child,"The reference to have on hand when identifying and dealing with issues raised with a child with Sensory Processing Disorder. Very well-written, easy to understand and apply the principles. It is never easy to raise special children, and this book is helpful to many parents, teachers and child care workers."
4,"Incredible, life changing book","If you have a child that is just a little ""out-of-sync"" with their peers, this book is for you! A college friend that was a practicing Occupational Therapist recommended this book after I asked for her opinion on my second childs behavior during a gathering of friends at our home a few years ago. At the time (2003 - I read the first edition of the book), not many doctors or therapists were educated in working with sensory disorders. Even today 5 years later, many people will look at you like you have 10 heads if you start talking about it. I however, felt that the author must have been hiding in my house while writing the book. It was my child to a tee! I have continued to recommend this book no less than once a month since then and get feedback from people that it was perfect for understanding their child."
4,Very Good Resource,"I am a behavioral Consultant for children with Autism. I am always looking for good resources to better understand the children that I work with and how I can provide the best help to meet their needs. I previously purchased the companion to this book, The Out of Sync Child Has Fun. I found that it was a great resource for activities and that it provided an overview of different sensory issues. I realized that I needed this book to dive a little deeper into sensory disorders. I think that this has been a great resource for me and I refer it to the parents I work with as well. I also recomend the campanion book as well as I have found some great ideas in it."
5,Helpful Resource,"I really appreciate the time, effort and detailed information placed in this edition. It's a valuable resource for those who have a love one diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). It's a very applicable book; I have literally taken several of its practices. There is also a nice section in the back about additional resource organizations. For me it was a must have to expand my knowledge and help library."
5,King of the Hill=Great T.V.,"King of the Hill is a classic show, and I am estatic to see that it has been FINALLY released on DVD. I truly applaud this show, as it has some of the most offbeat, yet hillarious humor not seen in a lot of the ""mainstream"" comedy shows today. Some may say the show is a bit ""redneck-ish"", but me being an African American male, I can easily relate to the plights of Hank Hill, and how he desperately wants to protect his friends and family, and all the hilarity that ensues. I would recommend this DVD set for any and everyone that needs to laugh, and laugh out loud."
5,king of the hill 1,king of the hill can do no wrong. this is the vest show ever made ever. i wishe it would come back or atleast sell the rest of the seasons on dvd
5,Great Grill,"Replaced a 6 yr old coleman grill, worth the extra money to go all stainless easy to clean cooks great and even very happy"
4,Great Product!,Had some initial problems that Windows 2000 did not recognize the hard drive using a USB port. I had to log in as Administrator. The formatting to NTFS took about 20 minutes. Retrospect express software is especially useful and extremely fast. Would be nice if the price was lower and it came with a carrying case.
1,Not a reliable backup-drive,"I have had this drive for three months, and a friend bought one at the same time.After a month or so the one my friend bought crashed without warning, without being moved or there being any other logical reason for the crash. It just stopped working, claimed that there was no file system on the disk and the led faded in and out and it made weird noises when he tried to access it.Two months go by and the same thing happened with my disk! It has been in the same place for months, I haven't even moved it!"
4,Very happy with it!,"Hubby and I have been debating a press like this for a bit. Being in my third trimester, I wanted anything to reduce my time on my feet, and my back always hurt from swaying/moving while traditional ironing. I was able to get my pants pressed in half the time the first try. Shirts take practice, but were soon going quickly.Women's shirts that are tailored for fitting don't turn out as well as men's straight shirts. If not careful, you can also easily burn your hand on the top plate while moving fabric. (Reason it didn't get 5 stars - would have liked for the top plate to lift up further.)Overall, glad I got it! Due to weight, recommend you have a permanent spot to set it up rather than pulling it out of a closet constantly."
3,Never Dissapoints,"Four teenagers mail a chain letter, a deadly chain letter which grants their darkest wishes and deepest desires. Now 20 years later they must pay for the deeds and the true terror begins."
2,"More of a description, please!!!!!","I would love to buy this pendant, but have no idea as to the length of it. If it was added, it would influence a purchase from me. Thank you."
3,Not as good as a cheaper model,I bought this waffle maker for my parents and was a little disappointed. I have a no-name waffle maker that works better (I could not find it; otherwsie I would recommend it instead). The waffles were not crisp on the outside and were soggy on the inside. Considering the premium name and the lack luster performance disappointment; I would have to think twice about buying this one again.
3,Got it for the B-sides,"Since I already own the album, I bought this single just for the B-sides--a habit of mine when it comes to Oasis. So what's the story this time? Thank You For The Good Times should have made the album, in my opinion. It sounds like a cross between Roll With It and Some Might Say, and is a lot better than All In The Mind, which, inexplicably, DID make the album, stinking up the second half of it. The other B-side Shout It Out Loud is not a Kiss cover, thankfully, but is not a great song, either. It's one of those plodding Noel ballads that eventually--and you have to be patient on this--grows on you. Why couldn't Liam sing it? Anyone else out there tired of Noel singing more and more leads?"
1,Absolute garbage,Do not waste your money on this! It is the worst CD for babies that I have ever heard!
5,Great watch,IT was exactly what I wanted and does everything its susposed to. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great sports watch.
3,Astrology put to good use,"This tongue-in-cheek book looks at the different signs of the zodiac and how the stars influence men to be the type of jerk that they are. In fact, it looks even deeper and lets the reader know that, regardless of how messed-up a man is you have to know his star sign to find out just how truly warped his life is. A fun example of humor writing."
1,Hateful,Just what the world needs: more men-bashing. Why is it acceptible at the moment to ridicule and demean men? A book like this that targetted any other group in society would be seen for what it is: a hateful stereotyping that harms us all.
1,My Favorite Dating Astrology Book,"This book is what you might call trash with no redeeming value whatsoever. Do not waste your life reading this utterly pointless drivel. If you think it's funny enough to read, that's kind of sad. If you think there's some truth to it, that's REALLY sad. Please please please go read something else. Anything else. Please. The power to choose is yours, take it. TAKE IT"
3,Nice Wedding Favor...but...,"For the price this was a great find for a weddding favor. However the bells did not always ring, so it became a nice keep sake for the guests who received it. It is an Oriental Trading item, but so no telling how long the seller had it their stock."
2,Mini Bells too small,"These Bells were too small to be heard, even is a quite room. They were cute as a decoration but not at all useful."
4,fun for children,I bought this to play with 4 children all under 10. It's a lot of fun if you have the patience.
3,"For a solid exfoliator, go for the regular version","This product would be great for someone whose skin is easily irritated by the standard St. Ives scrub, but I find it too weak."
5,Good Scrub.,Smells delicious and it lefts a feeling in your skin that you can't compare to anything. It really does what it promises. You will want to take a shower just to put this on your face.
4,Treat yourself today,"This is my favirote skin product to pamper myself with. The smell really isn't that great (I think they need to introduce something which really does smell like apricots), but it is very effective at removing dirt and oil from the skin.This product should be applied in the bath or shower. It is very messy and has a tendency to glop everywhere. Plus the acne medication can stain fabrics.I also strongly recomend purchases of the larger sizes because I go through the little tubes on a regular basis."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this after my mom recommended it. I got it, because i have an oily skin and blackhead problem. At first, it seemed to work- my skin was no longer oily, but really really dry. The nose areas became oily again, but since it was so dry previously, it just began to peal oily skin. And no help on blackheads."
3,Science experiments,This book is full of cool projects and experiments but it can become expensive. Each experiment has different materials that you have to get in order to carry them out.
2,"save yer money, buy a sack","This DVD is not good. I am a sucker for these kind of DVDs, and this looked great. It is not, the fights are super weak. True, the girls are very white trash, and the Boone Bros are pretty obnoxious, that's why it gets 2 stars. So if you're into white trash girls and redneck humor, this is for you, if you're into watching fights, save yer money and get a sack."
2,Won't keep correct time after few months use,"This clock was purchased for outdoor use and hung on porch of my Garden Shed that is covered. The clock is well sheltered. At first the clock lost only 2-3 minutes per month but after six months, it is now 39-44 Min slow every week. It has been reset many times (per instructions) and installed at least 3-4 NEW Batteries....IF anyone has suggestions of how to correct or fix, please say. Otherwise, trash is waiting and $$ is down the toilet for piece of junk."
3,Not a serious workout,"I'll start by saying that the only reason I own this is because it came in the Karen Voight Body Sculpting Kit that I got for Christmas. I probably would be irritated if I paid money for this, because it is so short and easy. On one hand it flew by and was enjoyable, but on the other hand it was pretty easy. The abs portion in particular seemed too easy, but I did feel my hamstrings burning during the leg section. Also, when she says ""legs"" she really means hamstrings. The quads and calves are not worked here. It is a nice short workout to do if you are feeling lazy but want to move, or I put it before I do the a.m. portion of the Streamline Fitness DVD. The stretching section is quite good. Oh, it is clearly a toning DVD- nowhere does it say cardio but since a previous poster was upset that there was no cardio I thought I would mention that you shouldn't expect to sweat."
4,"Karen Voight : B*L*T Butt, Legs & Tummy","Based on prior reviews, I was torn about buying this,,, but very glad I did. It is a good, overall workout. She spends just the right amount of time focusing on each area per the title (BLT), and while it's a workout, it's still enjoyable. My favorite part is that she gives you 'pointers' as you go, helpful tips to get the most out of the workout. It is an older DVD, so the styles have changed, but the workout is still a good one."
3,seems to be the right one but ...,"Purchased it for my Lexmark z605Although it doesn't fully support it.I lost the option to print in black onlyand my macbook can't recognize it, showingthe black cartridge is missing. HoweverI can still print out documents withoutproblems.My guess is 10n0217 is not fully supported byz605, should buy the 10n0016 instead."
5,Great quality and service,The quality and price of the exercise pen is unbeatable. I will be purchasing from them in the future.
4,Good pen,"This gate serves a good purpose in my room, blocking my rabbit from getting behind my couch, but it didn't work in it's true sense as a pen; my rabbit didn't like being confined and hopped on top of her cage to let herself out. I'm excited to use it outside in the spring and summer for her though, in pen form."
1,Worst confusing book I've read thus far,"I already became confused on the first few pages of instruction. I didn't understand how to set up the tags and it got worse from there. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Find another author who explains things in a concise and clear way. This author thanks alot of contributors in Barcelona, Spain. Maybe they are accustomed to confusing their readers."
3,a cool joint,back in the day when Bobby Valentino was part of this Group. this was a cool laid-back Jam.one of those jams that always stayed with you.real catchy joint. real catchy joint.
2,A Word of Warning,"The sound quality of this CD, volume 3, is poor in comparison to the first volume (which I recommend), We Cats Will Swing for You, Vol. 1: 1939-40. Almost every track has noticable static in the background, thus if static bothers you I would refrain from purchasing this item.The tempo ranges from 72-215 bpm with 10 songs <111 bpm and the remaining 6 songs >165 bpm. Lindy Hoppers will find three, maybe four decent songs, but nothing along the lines of Gangbusters or We Cats Will Swing For You (found in Volume 1)."
2,Not for the Faint of Heart,"While the subject mater is very disturbing, the writing stylings of Mr. Glass was even more so. To establish one's hypothesis in the begining is not uncommon, but to repeat it over and over distracts from the reading experience. I agree with the Kirkus Review, that the non-specialist steer clear of this one. An examination of the Final Solution and the society that enabled it's evolution is extreamly important at this time for two reasons: a. over time our picture of the event fades, b. it is applicable today more than ever. This book is the reason I support our public libraries."
3,Other Books,"Riding on the back of the fantasy role playing game craze came these interesting books, and plenty more popped up along with them on other topics, from other publishers.They were designed so that all you would need was a pencil and a simple randomiser and be able to carry the whole thing around with you, and introduce the game and chance into it.A Dungeon bash, of course."
5,The Perfect Gift,Wow! Beautiful! I opened the box and all I could think was simply beautiful! The real thing looks even better.Stylish and elegant for everyday or something special!
5,WOW...Brian May Recovers,"This is an awesome CD, real rock & roll, some metal, some ballad, some sounds you never heard before, some familiar Brian May guitar effects; Freddie would be proud"
4,MALE/FEMALE plugs!!!,"Make sure you understand that this is an EXTENSION cable, meaning one end is male, the other female. Fortunately, I already had a short S-video with male/male, which is what you need for a direct connection of one component to another.I agree with the other reviewer who likes the quality--this is a really thick, well made cable.BUT the rubber coating around the plugs is also very thick too, meaning that the plugs might not fit into some jacks that are crowded with other plugs. (In other words, you might have to whittle them down with a sharp knife.) Just keep that in mind. This somewhat offsets the quality of the cable, thus my 4-star rating. Price seems reasonable for the length and quality."
2,"Good movie, lousy picture quality.","My title sums it up-- some parts are decent, even good, but others are horrible-- fuzzy and occasionally pixelated."
5,The perfect meeting among composer and conductor!,"The spirit of Waltz acquires - in the supreme baton of this talented conductor - a very special label of aristocratic refinement, that panache and nuance that we possibly will not listen any more, because beneath the score, one may feel a sort of pulse and a nestled majesty immersed in the performance.Many other directors previously and in the future will have the chance to play these Waltzes but nobody will fit the sublime éclat of him."
4,Waltzes,"Excellent product for the price. Can't comment on the performance per se, having no real background in classical music, but the Strass Waltzes are very pleasing to me, and I would buy this CD again."
1,Awful hissing noise throughout,"I'm sure the music is wonderful, I just can't listen to it. Both in my car (RNS-510 stereo) and on my laptop there is an awful hissing noise throughout the recording."
1,Do Not Recommend Renting,Do not recommend this movie. Only watch about 10 minutes of this movie before deciding to turn it off. Waste of money for the rental.
2,"does the job, but only just","I really like the design, and when you just have some water in it and push the button....yeah, it's impressive.But put 8oz of milk in there and start adding a scoop of protein powder and it seems to be tough for it to do it's job. It will mix at first and the volume of the drink begins to increase (adding air??) and then you can't even tell it's mixing any more. I've had the best luck by holding the button down and slowly adding the protein powder (instead of all at once.) Seems to be less strain for it. The inclosed booklet mentions a 3volt adapter. I'm trying to decide whether to spend the money on getting that. I don't know if that will sustain power better than batteries or if I will just be wasting my money. So, overall, yeah, I like it sort of....but I'm disappointed too and half expect it to konk out at any moment."
4,Solution for leaky mixer - reverse the gasket,"I have had mine for years and LOVE it. It's true that it will get bogged down if you want a thick shake, but the regular shakes I make mix the powder in BEAUTIFULLY with NO lumps. If your mixer starts leaKing, do what I did: 1)remove/twist off the base from the plastic cylinder; 2) gently pry up the black gasket and flip it 180 degrees. The plastic is an angled compression fitting and over time the gasket gets compressed. If you flip it, the non-compressed part of the gasket is now doing the work and the leaks should be non-existent for a good long time. It's worked for me."
3,More Solo Than Together,"The strange thing about this 5-disc collection is that it's almost entirely Sonny Terry OR Brownie McGhee, rather than Sonny Terry AND Brownie McGhee. They're only together on 3 of the 125 songs. They teamed up mostly after these recordings, in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Good stuff nonetheless."
1,angry,THIS BOOK IS FAR TOO BIASED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK IT APPEARS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS AN AXE TO GRIND AND MAKES IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT RUDY IS NOT ONE OF HIS FAVIORITE PEOPLE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A BOOK ABOUT MAYOR GUILIANI THAT IS WRITEN BY SOMEONE WHO PRESENTS MORE BALANCE-
4,"Don't compare ""Silence"" with ""Hannibal""","The first mistake critics and audiences made with Hannibal is comparing it to ""Silence of the Lambs."" It can't be done. ""Silence"" was an academy award winner in virtually every meaningful category...It was a masterpeice. ""Hannibal"" is not ""Silence"", and should not be compared to it. Obviously if you compare the two, it just doesn't measure up. You have to look at ""Hannibal"" as its own film rather than a sequel. If you look at it like that you will find that ""Hannibal"" is a very well written, acted, and directed movie. Give it a chance and take a second look and don't think about ""Silence"" for awhile. I think you'll enjoy it more."
5,"Excellent sequel, if you can call it one","A great movie, a definite Must Have for everyone's DVD collection. Do not believe the idiots who gave this movie one star!"
4,Above or below the wrist?,"This movie has some of the best acting. Hannibal, Verger, Starling, all done superbly. Let me just say, people gave this an unfair rating. People were dissapointed that this isn't Silence of the Lambs II. This is a whole different movie. Just like Ridley Scott said in the DVD case(which you'll just have to read for yourself).So, my advice is get it. Watch it knowing it's a totally new movie. And don't watch this and eat at the same time."
2,Why the (lousy) changed ending???,"This film is gorgeously filmed & superbly acted - I think Ridley Scott is a brilliant artist. So why oh why did he have to change the wonderfully humorous, romantic pastiche of the ending in the book. What replaces it is ... - so disappointing -totally ruined what preceded it! SHAME!!!"
2,Why the terrible new ending???,"This film is gorgeously filmed & superbly acted - I think Ridley Scott is a brilliant artist. So why oh why did he have to change the wonderfully humorous, romantic pastiche of the ending in the book. What replaces it is JUST PLAIN DUMB - so disappointing -totally ruined what preceded it! SHAME!!!"
3,bit disappointing.,I watched this movie after reading the novel. May be this is why I was a bit dissappointed. I would be a fool to compare a movie with the novel it is based on. But about Hannibal I would say this: I actually miss Hannibal himself in this movie. The book presents a mind place or memory place created inside Hannibal's head which is completely omitted in this movie. The makeup of Mason disappointed me. The description in the book moved me more and really the gShock comes with the recognition that this is a human face with a mind behind it.h This is not the case in this movie. Anthony Hopkins is my favorite actor and I wonder if anyone could play the Hannibal role better. Julian Moore was okay. But I think the silence of the lambs was far better in every aspect and the present movie cannot stand for a sequel to that.
3,Dr. Lecter is Back!!!,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. (Which is now the 4th Hannibal movie in the order it's supposed to be.) Hannibal has been hiding in Italy from Clarice and anyone else who is looking for him. A dirty cop named Pazzi finds out who he is and tries to get the reward for his capture. Mason Verger wants revenge for what Hannibal made him do, and Clarice just wants to find him and put him in prison. If you love cop thrillers, and the Hannibal movies, you'll love HANNIBAL!!!"
1,What a letdown!!,"There is so much about this movie that is disheartening that I don't know where to start.Jodie Foster couldn't have helped this movie even if she had decided to reclaim her role as Clarice.There were characters and events that were left out (from the book) so much to the point that you almost don't even know what point the writers were trying to make. Not to mention the drastic plot change.I think Hollywood just thought the fact that it was the sequel to Silence of the Lambs would be enough to make it do well, but it just doesn't go over at all.Save your money on this one!!"
3,Book is so much better,"Like many, I read the book before the movie came out. Despite the bad reviews for the book, I think it is better than ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Harris' writing is so eloquent and beautiful that it is quite easy to get past the lack of plot-development (i.e. the last 30 pages: Beautifully written but the story was lost). The movie, however, was disappointing. What was captured in the book was lost in the movie. The performances in the movie were good, but it seemed to move much slower than the book. I'd recommend to everyone to read the book, at the very least, then maybe, see the movie."
1,Boring!!!,"well, the long awaited sequel to silence... The Media was hyped, I got Hyped, the movie was banned from italian cinema.. wow this must be something.. however it was NOT! this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever.. it was just boring, there were a couple good moments but nothing horrible or terrifying"
1,Worst Film Ever!!!,This is by far the worst made film ever. The plot holes are so large you drive 18 wheelers through them. I did not read the book nor have any desire to. Gory and stupid is the best description! This proves that Hollywood has hit rock bottom. I would rather see a remake of Plan 9 or Robot Monster than this junk. I wish I could have rated it 0 stars. None of the characters are sympathetic. You wish Hannibal dies. No more Hannibal Lecter films please. Anthony Hopkins obviously needed the pay check as his role was very pedestrian. The lovely Juliann Moore was wasted as was my $8.00. DO NOT BUY THIS.... BUY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS ONE......
5,HANNIBLE: Anthony Hopkins at his best,"I saw the movie the day it came out in theatres, and it was everything I expected plus some. Though I would have rather had Jodie Foster play SA Starling, Julianne Moore was an EXCELLENT replacement to play the more mature Starling. Now, if Hopkins had declined, I would have NEVER gone to see the movie, it just wouldn't be Hannible Lectar with out him. The violent scenes were very graphic, but few and far between made for the perfect amount of gore. It was very fun to watch Hannible work his magic, and they kept with the part of he never gets over anxious, ""his heart rate never went above 85."""
3,Not that great...,"I absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs, so I was highly looking forward to Hannibal.And when I first saw it, I was less than thrilled. I'm not saying that it's horrible...it's just...not that good.You take Julianne Moore (who isn't as good as Jodie Foster) and the incredible Anthony Hopkins, who are both terrific actors, and you put them in a movie that is less than stellar.Hannibal is filled with too much gore, distasteful innuendos, and a horrible plot. It could be difficult to follow for some. Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece, but Hannibal slanders the name masterpiece.If you truly love suspense, you will NOT like this movie...However, if you're into the whole blood/guts thing, you'll probably love this movie."
2,Far Too Violent,"The beauty of Silence of the Lambs was that most of the tension was psychological.The flaw of this movie is that the 'terror' of the movie relied on visualizing the violence, it did so in excruciating detail, designed more to sicken the viewer than scare them.Ick."
4,A Must See,"I am surprised to find many people disliked this movie. Personally I thought it was very good. Maybe not the best, but satisfying at least. Since the title of the film is actually 'Hannibal' I knew it would mainly be surrounding Hannibal Lecter, so I wasn't expecting a great deal more from it. However, another point which I also have to get off my chest, is the relationship between Clarice and Lecter. Now, being a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs, I did think Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster had good chemistry. But in Hannibal, I was completely blown away by Hopkins and Julianne Moore's chemistry together. The only disappointment was, in my opinion, there weren't enough scenes between Hopkins and Moore to express this, and probably change the minds of the audience. The other cast members, such as Gary Oldman whom played Mason Verger, also did a great job. Overall I thought the film was definately worth the money."
5,EXTRAORDINARY,"This is my favorite of the Hannibal series.It has the same thrills, chills and surprisesas its predecessors, but in this movie themusic and scenery were fantastic. It wastruly a gourmet's delight. :-)Rating: 10/10 5/5Bill SchaeferBerwyn, PAEphraim@chesco.com"
2,Not What I Expected,The movie starts off waaaayy to slow. Hanibal just sits in one area while they are going crazy looking for him. I expected something big to happen. I wanted someone to get brutally murdered or something ya know? But it never really reached a good enough climax for me to recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Total GARBAGE!,"Ive never written a review about a movie. I felt the need to do so here because it was such a completely appauling POS. I cant think of the correct words to describe this movie. Maybe ""symptomatic"" or ""unhealthy"" does more justice. Unfortunately, the fact that I thought it was so disturbing (on many levels) is a reason why many people might actually like it - sick people. With such movies being pumped out by Hollywood, there is absolutely no surprise kids can walk into school and blow away their teachers and classmates (and why our society can so easily tolerate it). The actors involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I for one will never watch another movie by this director or with any of the actors involved. I wish I could ""unwatch"" it. Shame, shame, shame. Yeah, graphic violence and over-the-top gore is real good for society. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,They Should Have Paid Us To Watch This,"I expect sequels to be somewhat close in calibre to the movies they are following. Well, HA!!! With this one, that expectation didn't even come close. To me, all this movie accomplished was gore & digust. What a shame that such a spectacular actor (Hopkins) agreed to lower himself and the character to this level. In my opinion, people should have been offered top dollar to waste their time and view this thing."
1,Hannibal,"Granted I'm tired with the phrase the book was better. However, in this case the movie did a grave injustice to the character Clarice. What happened to her in the book was the best surprise ending I have read or seen in a long time and the movie made sure to change it and ruin the spirit of the novel; in order to ensure that sequels will follow. But what else should we expect from Dino De Laurentis. Ridley Scott was shown up in the Alien series and he dropped the ball again here too."
1,Embarrassingly Bad,"This is surely one of the worst wastes of talent ever served up by Hollywood. Ridley Scott shoots some pretty scenes. Julianne Moore is beautiful, as always. Hopkins is game. Unfortunately, their efforts don't add up to anything. Blame the writer. I've read Hannibal (I'm ashamed to admit it), and If there had been any oversized wild pigs around, I would have fed it to them gladly after turning the last page. Pretentious dreck. No surprise that Jodie Foster wouldn't have anything to do with this debacle. I'd be willing to bet that Julianne Moore wishes she'd stayed home as well."
1,Glorifies child abuse,"The last scene glorifies child abuse. The film is by definition going to be disturbing, but I think that child abuse is too important to be trivialized in this manner."
3,Mediocre yet oddly satisfying,"Let's face it: ""Hannibal"" is nowhere near as good as ""Silence of the Lambs"" (I'm talking movies, not books). To quote Charter, ""Far-fetched and gory."" Plus it fails to capture Lecter's true intentions toward Starling (as brotherly or fatherly, not romantic). Yet, somehow, the film is oddly satisfying, and I find myself draw to it whenever it's on. The mix of operatic score during chaotic scenes is strangely effective (similar to the ethereal tracks during intense scenes in the LOTR series of films). So, no, it's not a great movie, and Lecter's behavior is sometimes ""out of character,"" but the movie is satisfying nonetheless."
3,"downer, big time","After enjoying the previous movie ten years ago I found that this production deviated way too far from the Thomas Harris book. Had I not read the book ""Hannibal"" I would have been total confused. What happened to the ending in the book? I thought that was a perfect way to end ""Starling's"" carreer. They were together.... Also I thought that ""Mason's"" sister in the book played a very important part. Did she not feed Mason an eel at the end and kill him. Where was she in the movie? What a disappointment after Silence of the Lambs!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,One Trick Pony,"These guys could REALLY use a good , strong producer. They are basically running with just one thing, which is best represented by the song ""Fighting For"", a sort of 80's rock pop with attitude song that's really just ""OK"", not great.You'll find listening to the other songs that they pretty much go right down that road, but that they lack even the mid level quality of songwriting that ""Fighting For"" has, leaving you feeling like you've been listening to a high school group, especially in the lyrics. Many of the songs are even in the same keys, making the CD kinda drone along without any dynamics from song to song.....I was pretty disappointed, but from what I hear these guys are really a LIVE band more than anything, so seeing them live might be a lot more fun than wading through this CD."
5,Thank God.....,...The mighty Leps are back! Nothing exceptionaly new and innovative on this disc....just solid moderm pop rock songs that are exceptionaly catchy and fun. Much better than anything out in the pop world of 2002. Pop it in the car and cruise like it was 1987......you won't regret it!
4,"Awww, isn't this nice...","Well, the badass days of Pyromania are long gone. Instead, what we have is a much sweeter side to Def Leppard, similar to what we got on Euphoria. This is a better album, though, very catchy and pleasant, and more cohesive overall. Much of Euphoria seemed thin and generic to me (aside from edgier tracks like Paper Sun), and while nothing here really knocks my socks off, it's a very satisfying album overall. This isn't metal, mind you, it's merely melodic rock, but if this is what Def Leppard is nowadays, fine by me. The ballads are pretty, the opener and closer have some muscle to 'em, Four Letter Word's got a good beat, and the whole disc's got plenty of trademark Def Leppard harmonies and melodies to enjoy. I don't know that this album is gonna attract the kids, but anyone who's grown up listening to DL should enjoy this (unless you absolutely want the old days back, in which case, go throw on Pyromania again)."
2,What the...,"Ok, im not a hardocore fan, i really liked high n' dry and pyromania, but this sound like the backstreet boys or n sync of the 80's. unless you are a hard core fan, dont bother."
1,Uggghhh!,"This is awful. I was hoping that Def Leppard's new release would sound similar to the great 80's albums like High And Dry, Hysteria, and Pyromania. Instead, I buy this piece of junk which sounds like the guys in N Sync were in agony. It's just like the regular pop album. Unless you like moaning ballad and la-de-da poppy love songs don't buy this it's not worth it. It went right in the garbage can."
1,What a disappointment,"Sorry, but this album is the worst, and this is coming from a long time Def Leppard fan. The only good songs on here are ""Now"", ""Cry"" and ""Scar"", so there..."
1,Worst Def Leppard CD ever!!!!,I am a big Def Leppard fan and have every cd of theres from High and Dry through Retroactive. And I listen to samples of this cd and I think it [is not good]. It sounds nothing like the music that made them as big as they are today. In my opinion it has more of a Dave Matthews Band sound to it than past cds like Histeria. If they want to win over fans(and me) then on your next album make it sound like Pyromania or Histeria or even Adrenalize. If you don't then I and probably a lot of other people won't buy any more of your cds and will just reflect back on a once great band.
4,"Good Melodies, But A Little Too Teen-Pop","X is an excellent Def Leppard album. The melodies are good, and you have to admire them for playing around a lot with their sound.The only problem is, they chose to bring in a heavy teen-pop influence, which is not totally appropriate for guys in their early 40s. This album would have been better if they had chosen to try to be the Outlaws or Bob Seger instead of the Backstreet Boys or N-Sync."
3,Not Vintage Leppard,"If your after vintage Def Leppard, this album may not be for you. This is very much the new sound from the Sheffield band.To me, this album isn't bad, but Def Leppard seem to have lost their individuality and have tried too hard to fit in with the 'modern' music scene, instead of staying with their own sound. This disapoints me. The sound of heavy guitars seems to be long gone. This album is very much a pop-orientated album and the words 'pop' and 'Def Leppard' shouldn't mix. But on this album they do. But this album is still growing on me as i try to adapt to Def Leppard's 'new sound'.This album certainly isnt bad, but they era of 80's rock has certainly passed us. But what is still evident is the brilliant vocals of lead singer Joe Elliott.In conclusion, this album is certainly worth a listen but don't expect the sound of the 1980's Def Leppard to come rushing back!"
4,not the same DL!,"I gotta tell you, I was so excited when I heard that my Leps had a new album coming out, and bought it the first day it was at Sound Warehouse. I drove back to work only listening to the first few seconds of each cut because I was in a hurry and from what I heard in those few seconds, I was disappointed. BUT.. on my hour drive home, I listened to the whole thing and fell in love. ""Everyday"" and ""Long Long Way to Go"" spoke to me. ""Now"" was an interesting single choice, but a good one as far as I'm concerned. But hey - I loved ""Slang"" too after a few listens. If you're not sure about ""X"" the first time you listened, give it another try or two. This CD is just like Def Leppard is.. better and better the more you listen."
5,The boys must be in love!,"I was very surprised when I first listened to this cd. It wasn't as hard as I expected. I think they must be in love because most of the songs are about love and/or loosing love. I think anyone would like it! They are definitely one of the best bands around, they must be since they've stayed around. I would highly reccomend this cd."
3,Quiltagami,"The finished items in this book look fantistic. However, the illustrations are done in line drawings and it is difficult to see the actual turn of the fabric. It would be much better if there were actual photographs used so that the visuals actually matched the end result. Inside the book it says you can contact the published, which I did, but I have not recieved any communication back from them. I would still like more information and better photos to complete the projects in the book."
3,Excellent Book,Bought this book for my wife. She has got a lot of use out of this book and has made several quilts from ideas she has gotten from this book
2,Distorted View,I am going to make this short and sweet. I found 50% of Mr. Michael Glueck's experiences to be very different from my own in my 10 years in the country. About 20% of the information was just out right incorrect.
1,a period curiosity only,"This is Boole of boolean algebra. The book, now 150 years old, is a long winded philosophical curiosity. Do NOT expect to learn boolean algebra!"
5,Lund tonnaeu cover,"Very happy with this product. It was easy to install, arrived much quicker than I expected. Very good value and quality."
5,Awesome watch,The pedometer is a lot more advanced than most. It has an accelerator meter in it which measures your arm swinging rather than jolts. It is 95% accurate vs 70-80% for others. Great workout watch.
1,Not useful,Go instead with a dedicated pedometer with USB interface. The watch tracks movement indiscriminately making it inaccurate vs an accelerometer based pocket or belt unit. Also more expensive. Programming and set up harder than Casio (the digital watch standard). Feels cheap.
2,Semi-Good,"Wichcraft 4 this is the the fourth of the saga and one of the bored ones. I have all 12 movies and trying to colect them on dvd now, but since am a horror fan, i dont mind having all these bored ones. Recomended it if you are a horror fan, you may want to see the saga from the beggining to understand it better other wise please dont wates your time."
5,How can you not love this show???,"Love. Hate. Loss. Gain. Anger. Joy. Wedding. Separation. Struggles. Triumphs. Illness. It's just another day on the frontier. How can you not love this show? It's a surreal combination of make-believe and reality. The families in this show fight the elements of life on the frontier, every day. Sometimes their fights are with their neighbors, their families, or even within themselves. It is remarkable to see how the families change during their stay in the Montana wilderness. It is interesting to see the individual families follow the rules to their own interpretations. It is difficult to review this without containing spoilers. The most amazing part of the whole show was the comment that the girls gave at the end. I won't divulge it. It would not have the same impact, unless you watch the whole show. :) My whole family watched this and we all enjoyed it for different reasons."
3,Works Fast but Not Long,"This product worked fantastically in that it was easy to use and worked quickly. After one day I was seeing less bugs and after three they were pretty much gone. However, it certainly does not last twelve months. I have had it for maybe two months and am seeing bugs again. It was easy to use though, and did work effectively."
3,Worm Factory,"Am very happy with the worm factory. Wish I would have bought the more expensive version simply because of the lid though. This lid does not fit snuggly. After the first night several worms had escaped and met their doom. Since then they all seem to be content in their new home and multiplying quick, but when it rains heavily I have to cover up the composter, so they don't drown. The unit comes with great directions and all of the tools to start composting except the worms."
1,Worthless,This thing is too small and worms crawl right out of it. I suggest a system with a closed lid.
4,Lid Holders,Lid holder was just what I was looking for.. Price was good and product shipped on time.
4,Take it for what it is.,"I love the way Gurf Morlix carves out his own turf, disregarding critics and possibly even admirers. You get a sense listening to him here, that he writes and plays for his own pleasure and would put forth just as good an effort whether he were in Carnegie Hall or his own Garage.Take this album for what it is and you'll enjoy it immensely. What is it? Gurf playing and singing all by his lonesome, save for a little help from a drummer on a few tracks. Some cuts remind me of Buck Owens or Dave Dudley and others veer into real toe tappin' rockabilly.Gurf is as polished as ever here on every instrument he attempts. And his vocals...... well, he's no Merle Haggard, but he applies his texas twang to uncomplicated, yet creative lyrics in such a way, that you can't help but like it.Album of the Year? Far from it. But if you're not careful you might just find you're singing along with ole Gurf, as you head down the highway."
3,Um...Robert?,"I can't possibly hate on Mr. Walter in these musically depraved times, but uh yeah, Giving Up The Ghost kind of sums it up. The Ghost being the funk that Mr. Walter was helping to keep alive. The 'Giving Up' on keeping it real and organic, in favor of bowing to the Yamaha's eletronic sounds and effects.Robert's beauty is Rhodes, Clavinet, electric paino etc - stretching out in the studio with a wall of keys in front of him, freaking on each one like a mad scientist. Ain't no need for this dude to synthesize.This album isn't all bad. The grooves are tight and the rhythm usually has bottom. But I'd definitely recommend starting at the 1st 20th Congress Album or his first ever solo record with Gary Bartz."
5,Treasure Hunt,"I agree with you Stephanie. That's exactly what I did. I've been hitting used book stores, garage sales all the time, whenever I can. At least I kept all my Chrisotpher Pike books at least. Rumor has it that ""The Secret Circle"" series is being reprinted, I have no idea if that rumor is true, but it's a nice rumor."
5,The cd does the concert justice,"I was at the Concert at Laga in Pittsburgh when the CD was recorded, and listening to Live puts me back in that concert groove. The Theory give a great show and this album portrays that skillfully. All Juliana Theory fans should own this album and it's a good cd to let people listen to to get a sampling of the band. It's got most of my favorites from their earlier work on it and conveys the concert energy well."
3,Ok,"My dog LOVES this toy, it's his favorite so I've gotten a couple of them...they just don't last very long. If I see the hole before he does, I sew it up, but I really wish I didn't have to.."
4,No toy is perfect but this one is great,"We have a 2,5 year old German Shepherd and he loves his Rabbit. We purchased several different toys in the last 2 years but this is our third rabbit. The squeaky thing inside the toy usually breaks within a few weeks but the rabbit holds up pretty well."
5,"Plush, durable brown bunny","So far after about a month, our medium hound/lab mix did not chew out the stuffing. He loves the honk that this toy makes. He loves to take a nap with his ""bunny""."
3,Who Would Have Thought...,"...you could make a whole book out of strung-together factoids? That's what this book is.Now, that's not altogether bad. If you're looking for the story of how a huge-selling novel that redefined our concept of organized crime was transformed into one of the most compelling movies of the last thirty-plus years, you WILL be disappointed. However, that's like saying going to a salad bar is not as satisfying as getting served a planked steak.So, adjust your expectations. If you're looking for a fun collection of random little notes and items about these three films, this book suits. However, if you'd like a more in-depth look at how moviemaking can excel (I and II) or fall flat on its face (III), it's ain't here."
4,Such a great album,"I bought this album because I heard her version of Sting's Fields of Gold on the radio--just fabulous. If you love a better than Norah Jones blues singing, you'll love this. Other singers I love are Susan Tedeschi and KD Lang."
4,Fun and Peace,A wonderful and somewhat different contribution from one of the true artists of our time.
1,UN-watchable MESS,As a fan of both the director and the artist...I could not have imagined a bigger waste of time than this rubbish! A previous reviewer said it best ...this is a car wreck of a movie..a ten car pile up on the intersate with bodies tossed and bleeding...and NO help on the horizon. PLEASE take a detour around this one.
1,Should have bought a Juppy!,"First of all, when I purchased Walking Wings for my 11 month-old son, I did not realize there was any other alternative on the market for a parent-assisted baby walker. After I placed my son in the Walking Wings, he had the inclination to lean/fall forward. My attempts to encourage him to walk forward resulted in him crying in pain on the floor, most likely due to the Walking Wings hiking up on his armpit area and hurting his arms. Only after discarding my Walking Wings and teaching my son how to walk ""the old fashioned way"" did I find there was an alternative - The Juppy Baby Walker. Similar to Walking Wings, but with one important difference - full body support for your child!The Juppy Baby Walkeris also cheaper than Walking Wings. I regret purchasing Walking Wings for my son."
3,Not Enough Support. Possibly Uncomfortable.,"I thought this product would be a perfect way to assist my son in walking without me straining my back to bend forward while holding his hands. However, my son being that he is in the 98% of weight and height, didn't look well supported as his arms lifted up and slowly started to slip out. Even though he didn't actually slip out completely, it was awkard and seemingly uncomfortable for him. The idea of this product is great, but I suggest that this product could use a few improvements."
3,"LOVE the Beatles, not the shape this album was in!","I know this is an old record book, but it was pretty worn! This was a present for my friend and he abcolutely loved it... but I was disapointed by the shape it was in."
5,Wonderful reference guide for Pagan Ministers,"This book deals with a subject that is often painful and ignored with hartwarming compassion and insightful techniques. As a Pagan minister in training, I have found this book to be invaluable.Especially wonderful was the inclusion of Gay(Queer) pagan beliefs and concerns. Raed this book. Blessed be!"
5,The best among half-dozen tested,"This book was the best out of about a half-dozen books in which i carefully reviewed a test chapter, on tennis serving.Subsequently i read the entire book, which is voluminous.The book's not perfect. There are occasional areas of ambiguity and repetition, which the publisher Alfred Knopf company did not catch. But it was still the best of a random sampling of such books. Knopf should re-print it."
2,Virgo?,"I have used and had very good results from the virgin hair fertilizer but this ""Virgo"" fertilizer is not producing the same results."
5,New growth,"All I can say is BRAVO! Finally a product that lives up to its name. My hair normally grow fairly slow but nt with this product! I was beyound shocked with my new growth especially since I had just permed my hair! I am now using this product on all my clients who wear braids, they 2 are amazed with the results.. I am def a client for the life!!"
2,I got Virgo,"I was expecting Virgin Hair Cream. Although the Ad says its a name change, the photo still shows Virgin as the name of the product you expect to get!"
1,Episode titles?,"The show gets five stars from me--but, the entry gets only one. How can we know what we are buying if you don't at least tell us the episode titles? Thank You."
1,Too Easy to Figure Out,"I have read many mystery books, and I am from a Scottish family and I must say I was very disapointed by this book. I had the mystery solved from the time a body was discovered. I kept hoping for a twist but it ended with no such luck. If you are hoping for a good mystery and many twists, this is not the book for you. It read much like a ""Nancy Drew"" book rather than an adult mystery. It was much too easy to figure out!"
4,"So far, so good","Only 3k miles on them so far, so hope they will still be around at 80k like my last set of $40 AutoZone discs. Right out of the box, they feel like a quality part. Different milling than other rotors, no surface rust, and HEAVY in your hands. Much heavier than normal. I am hoping it lives up to the Brembo name. For the price, you really cant do wrong."
1,How in the world do you put the batteries in?????,"This flashlight looks great, but I see nowhere to insert the batteries. Nor have I ever owned a flashlight that requires a philips head screwdriver to install same. I have now removed four screws and am no closer to solving the problem. Where are the instructions? Duh???"
3,5th Ward weebie of da heezie!!!!!!!!,The album is preety tight he has some hot tracks and he comes a little diffrent on ths album and he brings it on everty track he feat bg and juv and both of those tracks are hot so overall I think this is a good album.
1,More Sizes,"I need this item in a large tall for a 6'8"" person. I would also like to have the leggings in a medium tall size for the same person, HE is 6'8"" tall and weighs 168 lbs.Thank you."
4,Don't cut the good stuff out man!!!!!,"From reading some of the other reviews I see I am not the only one who was disappointed when I got this on DVD because I already had a vhs copy and realized that hey, they cut quite a few scenes out of this movie which I think are of value. People who see this version without the benefit of seeing the uncut version will have hardly a clue of what is going on because the movie itself is a little confusing. I loved the uncut version and I hope they release a better copy of this. I may just have to break down and buy another vhs player so that I can watch this again the way it is meant to be watched, in its' entirety."
4,Rips,"Children of Bodom's last couple releases weren't atrocious, but they showed the band losing steam. The Finnish melodeath torch has been passed. Kalmah's received a bit of negative attention for sounding like Children of Bodom, but with each passing release Kalmah is subtley differentiating themselves from peers. I can't imagine CoB doing anything like slowing things down as the singer sings in a slow, baritone voice, like in the song ""The Third, The Magical."" Still, the staples are present; killer lead work that explores different melodic avenues but still shreds, thin raspy screams, swampy bass, and glittery keyboards straight from Atlantis. Kalmah's keyboards elevate the band above other bands that use keys, in the sense that they're -actually adherent to the compositions.- All this and some sharp, catchy arrangements equals a worthwhile album.- Thus says the Pellington"
3,A translation of a translation??,"I haven't read this edition, but note that the translator did not read the book in the original Arabic but rather paraphrased the medieval Hebrew translation.A proper translation of any work has to be done from the original. Such a new translation of Kuzari is, to the best of my knowledge , in progress.In the meantime there is no satisfactory English Kuzari available. Therefore, this book might offer the best way to become aquainted with one of the classics (probably the second most important work - after Maimonides) of medieval Jewish philosophy"
1,The reader from Jerusalem is right,"The reader from Jerusalem who said that the translation must be from the original Arabic is right. Amazingly, this translator finds the currently available translation (there is only one, not two)""unacceptable."" However, it was done by a very great scholar and is from the original Arabic text. The problem now is that there is a new critical edition of that text, so that a new or updated translation might be worthwhile. In any case, this book is not that."
3,"Interesting, but not my favorite","Pretty well written, but had a little trouble relating to the author. Maybe male readers can appreciate his perspective more than I can."
2,DO NOT BUY-DO NOT!,"This complete learning system has only one positive attribute- the CD's that demonstrate how the music should sound when played. The woman instructing is so lackluster and stiff that it is almost impossible to watch, let alone learn from. Another disapointment was the instructional book. I am truly a beginner, and the book is just not informative enough. It doesn't tell you where to put your fingers on the strings, just to play a scale. Who knew that a sharp was in a different location?Anyway- there are better instructions for free online- Folk of the Wood has taught me for free what my 30 dollar investment in this system could not.DO NOT waste your money, spend it instead on one lesson with a professional."
4,Aged but Still Very Relevant,"Being relatively new to Freemasonry, I was looking for a book to fill the gaps in my knowledge. I found it!I am amazed at how much this book continues to reveal to me. It's the sort of book that you can pick up every day and learn something new. Alternatively, it can be used as a reference. Yes - it is aged, but still relevant and interesting in my view.It was written in the nineteenth century and contains the history of the craft, a cyclopaedia of Freemasonry and a dictionary of symbolic Masonry. This book is an incredible source of information and reveals the depth and breadth of this ancient craft.Some of the words are quaint but it is easy to follow and understand. I recommend it to all Freemasons."
2,Totally Disappointing!,"Totally disappointing. The beginning was good, the middle sucked, the end sucked. Apart frm being totally plotless, this book was ridiclously obvious in its effrots to be aimed at 'awkward's tage of teenage girls. When do I get my four hours back?"
5,The Lovely Bones,"A perfect book. Delicately, but unforgetably, vioce for people horribly lost, headlined, quantified, and the people who love them. Most people read this because it seemed all of America was doing the same thing. The point of view was interesting and the story of the grieving family kept their attention.However, for the most part I could wrap myself around this one. Perhaps there were too many subplots and minor characters. Also my experctations may have been too high, but the book seemed to really make me seem like I was there. I thingk a movie of this book would make a real good movie. Highly recommended!!"
1,No literary merit.,"An appealing characteristic of the book is the comfort is has given to people (see other reviews), and I applaud the book in this regard. However, viewed solely on its literary merit, not emotional merit, it deserved 1 star. After a quick beginning, Sebold's plot line deteriorates, and the writing style never goes beyond the level of Danielle Steel."
5,Never Stopped Crying,"This is not a book to read out in public - that's for sure! I cried all the way through it. I couldn't put it down, and my 16 year old daughter read it even more quickly than I did. A truly great read for sappy moms who love their children and can't imagine what it would be like to have one murdered or die."
3,"Interesting premise, dissapointing novel.",Hokey and cheesy --- especially the anti-climactic ending. Over-hyped book equivalent to sappy romance novels without the romance. Better options out there.
2,lovely bones,"The Lovely Bones is a stroy told by a girl who is in heaven. This heaven is no ordinary heaven though. It is her own heaven and it is changed according to her own desires. While in heaven she tells her story from the past but the story also takes place at the present.During the story Mr. Harvey, the killer of Susie goes about his evil deeds. During the book you find out how evil Mr. Harvey actually is. You find out about his past and how he comes to getting caught.The suspense in this book is not that great. Most of the book is just the neighbors trying too prove Mr. Harvey killed Susie. The book all in all was pretty lame. There is not enough action during the book except in the beggining. I did think that it was clever how the author set the opening paragraph for the story."
3,Death Warmed Over,"I picked this book up because I overheard some authors talking about it.Rape and murder are the backbones of mysteries/thrillers today and the story told by a fourteen-year-old spirit is all too common in the newspapers. It is almost, but not quite a ghost story that wanders into fantasy.THE LOVELY BONES opens with Susie Salmon watching from the spirit world as life goes on without her, while she yearns to returned to the life she was cheated of living.A good read on a dull day.Nash Black, WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS are available in Kindle editions."
4,One of the best books I have ever read.....,"The Lovely Bones, I have to say is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It is so full of emotion, power, and has purely realistic capabilites. Many readers have said that this novel is depressing, and is throughout its entirety. However, this isn't entirely true. Towards the end, the mood begins to change in the personalities of the characters, and you see how the novel all fits together. I recommend this book to everyone who wants a great book that they can't put down. Yet, out of the positive notes, I would like to say, there were a few moments where the book was a little slow, but it quickly picked up by another event. Still, this is one of my favorite books."
1,This book was a waste of my time.,"I had to see what was supposed to be so great about this best-selling book. Honestly, nothing is great about this book. A good story is something that makes you to go from page to page. This book was a boring read. It could have ended ten chapters earlier. I do not recommend this book at all."
2,"Recommend, with reservations","This book is just okay. I finished it in two sittings just so I could be free to move on to something more stimulating. If you enjoy tears, sappiness, and emotion-fests in general, by all means read this book. This book is definitely in the teen-girl fiction school of pop psychology. If you want two dimensional characters and supernatural smarm, look no further. There are some redeeming qualities: Harvey is a creepy and well-drawn force. Also, Sebold's idea that there is not a strict separation between the living and the dead is pretty profound and worth more consideration."
3,this book has inspired me tobecome a writer,"i think this book is OKAY. it's good . .but i agree with ""don't believe the hype"" review. i hate to be negative but it's true, somewhere in the middle of the book the author went from fabulous to mediocre. i stayed in it b/c it was so promising. the story line had a chance to be told really well. i mean, the story is a li'l quirky but i bought into it anyway. there were moments where the storytelling just really went backwards. i got frustrated b/c some parts were just not written well. i had to re-read some parts b/c the story wasn't being told well. the author lost me b/c the writing style got lazy and the quality diminished. despite that, i finished it . . so, go figure."
3,"Great,....until the end!","I really really enjoyed this book, but was very unsatisfied with the ending. Too many storylines are left unresolved. Apart from the ending, it was a nice light read."
4,A Quick Read and Unusual Story,"What an interesting story this is! A topic that sounds so awful and distasteful - a story that starts with the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl - but the ensuing tale of the girl coming to terms with her fate, her family's struggle to right itself in the aftermath of her murder and the resolution to the story was so good, I couldn't put this book down. It evoked many strong feelings in me as I followed along with what the family had to go through in the years after her death. I thought the ending, with its super-natural twist, was a risk on Sebold's part, but I think it worked and I felt satisfied. I want to read her other book ""Lucky"" next."
1,Don't waste your time!,"In her book Alice Sebold preyed on my primitive motherly fear of something happening to my child. She did this to keep me reading through her mundane, drawn-out, wordy narrative. She could have written this whole story in two chapters, but chose to pull me into her story by fear and then keep me in ""reading purgatory"" for chapters on end. I read so much waste before I could grab another tiny little morsel of the plot. I wanted to know what ultimately happened to Susie Salmon and Mr. Harvey. I found myself reading for the purpose of getting to the end of the book. When I finally did get to the end, all I could say was ""it was a waste of my time."" Don't read this book...NOT WORTH IT!"
4,Ending was a bummer...,This was a really good read...up until the end...which I WILL NOT SPOIL for anyone.There are two things the writer could've (should've) done that would have madethis book excellent. I don't regret buying it though and I encourage othersto do so too. I still can't get over the ending though...
2,lovely bones,I would have to agree with the lady from Texas--this book isn't really that great. Agree that the beginning is interesting but unfortunately it just doesn't keep you moving. I'm surprised it is doing that well because I had to push myself to keep reading it and I eventually gave up and read the ending; wasn't impressed. I'd take a pass on this one.
3,Good book - strange parts,I really liked this book. I had a hard time putting the book down at first but then the story took a weird turn and I felt like it ruined it. The soul swapping and love making part made the story lose its affect for me.
5,"Superb, sad,and satisfying","Alice Sebold carries the story forward - seeing the aftermath of death on the mourners, as told by the deceased. A combination of reality and spirituality, I could see people I know and I could see myself. This different view of mourners follows their actions while exposing the thoughts behind them, and they could be any of us. a fantastic book."
5,This book had me to tears at many points....,I couldn't put the book down. It has a great description of what heaven might be like. I liked the detail description of what it would be like to look down on our loved ones life after we are gone. I won't give away how she ended up in heaven..but I will tell you it is sad..I highly recommend this book.
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"** SPOILERS**I usually write reviews about books I have enjoyed reading, but I was so disappointed with this book that I felt compelled to write a review. First of all, those that liked the book have to keep in mind that not everyone is going to buy into the hype and be completely taken by it. It was the movie trailer that sparked my interest in the book. The book started out promising but half way through it was nothing but drivel. I didn't like how she jumped from one character to the next. Susie's mother seemed like a bored housewife that decided to change her life by leaving her family for a few years. I can deal with the fact that they never found Susie's body, but having her killer die in such a pathetic way and not bringing him to justice was the most upsetting thing for me. I found it lame and trite and don't recommend it."
2,A Great Book? I beg to differ,"I personally did not like this book. Everyone said it was great, so I checked it out from the ""teen-kids"" section. I think it belongs in the adult section of the library. It rambled on and on and was too slowly paced. I felt the author included too many irrelevant things in the story and it was too graphic. Even so, I liked the author's depiction of heaven and what went on. The ending was a little bit of a letdown, as well."
3,"Pretty good, just don't go in expecting the best.","I feel that I had read way too much hype about this book prior to reading it, and therefore I expected way to much from this book. I had also got done reading one of the best book that I have ever read, and was hoping, althought I knew it couldn't beat that book, that it would at least be close, but all in all, I don't think it was up to that level. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book that would be nice to read just to relax, but I really did not like the ending at all. Some things were ok, but I think that it really could have been put together better in the end and could have had better outcomes. I can guaruntee that this is not one of those books that you will struggle though, at over 300 pages I got through it in just two nights of ready very easily.All in all, I do recommend this book, but don't expect it to be the best thing that you have ever read."
2,discontent,well this book is a great read until you get to the last three chapters! it seems like another person wrote the end of the book. Maybe Alice just got bored? In anycase if you want a good ending this book is not recomended!!
4,Amazing wordsmithing,"I read this book in one night, I kept trying to go to sleep and my mind kept taking me back to it. I have already recommended it to friends, one of whom is currently reading it. I thought the writing was superb. The characters are multi demensional and there aren't any easy answers given. I appreciated that this devestating story didn't just rush from beginning to end, but followed the story for as many years as it took for the characters to begin dealing with their grief and lost dreams.Excellant"
2,"Some fine writing, a flimsy device","Though Sebold's scenes of the family's grief and mourning of Susie Salmon are convincing and often wrenching, her depiction of heaven as a subdivision, where everyone has their own place and intake worker, seems silly and false. Sebold's setting up rules for the place (the dead cannot interact with the living) and then breaking them twice (the final time a teenaged deflowering) is artistically flabby and dishonest.Like most bestsellers, this book has been praised far beyond its merit."
1,Very disappointed,"I had such high hopes for this book, after all it seemed so ethereal, right up my alley. The story context sounded great! Boy was I cruelly disppointed. I had a very difficult time understanding the style of writing, it did not flow. I am an avid reader who has read all sorts of books from various authors, however the writing style was just a struggle. Sadly I will not buy another book from this author but I do wish her good luck."
4,A Great Read,"I had no idea really what this book was about when I bought it, except that every one seemed to have read it apart from me. From the first page onwards I was hooked, this is the best book I have read so far this year. A great read. I wouldn't recommend the autobiography book though - a little to depressing. Buy this and enjoy!"
1,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many people rave about it, but I found it incredibly disappointing. As mentioned by another reviewer, I too had to force myself to finish it - I kept hoping that the book would redeem itself by the end, but the writing was not strong enough to follow through on what, initially, is an interesting idea."
2,What I Want Heaven To Be,"I think that I'd like my heaven to be something along the lines of what is written in this book, with a choice to move forward or continue to watch over my friends and loved ones. While of course the subject matter was difficult to deal with, I found some comfort in the story of her living in her heaven as the puzzle of her death fell into place. I have to admit that I found some comfort as well in the death of her murderer, although I wish it had happened sooner. I understood that the book was fiction, but some parts of it touched me deeply with the way it was written. I recommend the book. If I watched the movie first, I never would have read the book, as it wasn't that good."
1,{review},{my thoughts} - I must confess I watched the movie before I had read the book. The movie left me in a daze slightly confused as to what was actually being portrayed. I read the book in order to try and straighten out that confusion I had been left with. The book helped to create the imagery that I was not getting from the movie. It also gave me whole story aside from the bits and pieces that were put together in the movie. All and all I would have rather read the book and skipped the movie. It's a really nice read and it paints and interesting picture of what Heaven may possibly look like. It also shows that with a little determination and investigation it is possible to solve a murder.{reason for reading} - I had watched the movie and didn't understand it.
3,"A unique story, but ultimately not that good","This book has a unique story, but I found myself forcing myself to finish it despite a lack of interest. It is an average story, but certainly doesn't crack my list of top 100 reads."
5,Literary Brilliance,"This book is nothing short of genius. I was amazed at how Sebold's mind works. She is a brilliant and compelling author. Susie Salmon takes us on her journey as she struggles between earth and Inbetween. Her desire to comfort her family in their grief and her yearning to move to her final destination is stirring to read. From the beginning we know who her murderer is and Sebold ALMOST manages to paint a sympathetic portrait of him. Susie's murder is graphic and disturbing, but she relay's her death to us in matter of fact tone. Susie is not consumed with her killer being found although she does cheer when someone stumbles upon a clue. We watch with her as her family members grapple with guilt as they try to move forward. It is only until Susie can let earth go that they will be able to do that."
3,ehhhh......,I thought it started out with an interesting concept but then I lost interest right away. Did not care for this book.
3,Great Begining,"The begining is written excellently. You find yourself feeling the pain of the Salmon family as Susie watches from above. However, there was too much drifting with Susie's memories. At some points I couldn't tell where they were at (by time). It is an easy and quick read, and most likely will bring tears to your eyes."
2,not much to say,"After having read this book, I honestly don't hold any great memories about it - just what everyone above says about it, plus to me it seems like a totally made-up story told by a 14 year old - and just that, its vocabulary is easy to read (for I am spanish)and it strikes me like the writer tries to make it somehow thrilling, but it only ends up giving you the minimum bit of energy that you need to finish the book - nothing thrilling, nothing to share, really. Plus, her life was so normal, their lives are so common there's nothing extra that makes you feel anyhhow."
1,Just awful,"I got this book as a gift and the person who gave it to me used the word"" hideous"" to describe it and asked me to tell her my thoughts.Well, plain simple, this is an awful awful book! I could not even finish the book because it was dragging and 150 pages in, it just did not go anywhere. As much as I feel sorry for what happened to Susie, she is just a boring character!!!!I wound up skipped about 100 pages(and apparently I did not miss out much) and started glancing through the tedious paragraphs and when I got to the part of Susie(in Ruth's body) seducing Ray, I just could not take it anymore. You are raped and killed and instead of spending time with your family(while you have a chance to communicate with humans), the first and only thing you want to do is to have sex?!!!!A very pretentious and amateur read. If you dont have anything better to do, still do not give it a try."
3,A different type of story,"After hearing so much about this book, I decided to read it. The writing was good, the characters were decent, but I couldn't get past the fact that the book involved a gruesome murder. I usually read books to escape from the world. This book is just too real, so I guess the writer did a good job. I was just really sad and depressed as I read the book."
3,LOVELY BONES,I finished the book last evening. I didn't want to read the book because of the subject matter but our book group selected Lovely Bones for April.I must agree with some of the reviews. The first half of the book was well done. I found the second part where she enters Ruth's body for the sexual experience she lacked in life a bit too much like the movie Ghost. It was not necessary and made it too much like a Hollywood plot. I agree with the other reviews that she may have hurried the end of the book as authors so often do.
4,Almost Poetic,"Mesmorizing.I decided to slightly alter my style of writing after reading this book. It wasn't intentional, but I noticed some changes in my techniques.That is how great this story is: enough to seep into your mind and alter your life."
3,Interesting,"I was quickly drawn into the story. It certainly has an unusual premise. The author probably purposefully selected the most ordinary setting she could think of for the tagedy to take place. As you would expect from such a milieu, the characters are ordinary and believable in their ordinariness. I experienced sympathy for the characters, especially the father and son, but I didn't get choked up over the story, which started out as a literary work and metamorphosed into popular fiction, running out of steam at the end."
2,Eh? Not my favorite!,"I was truly expecting more from this book. It took me in in the beginning, but started falling short about the middle. I saw the movie also and to me it would be a toss-up as to which is better!"
5,Thrilling. DONT PUT IT DOWN.,"This book is bone-chilling and amazing. I loved every minute of it and was sad when I turned the last page to see nothing but the back of the book. I would recommend this book for anybody over the age of 14. Definately an adult book but mature teens can read it as well. You need to read this book if you love suspense, character growth, and mystery."
3,Heaven on Earth,"The book was good. I think the investigation with Mr. Harvey was going good and then it stops...But maybe in real life that is how is works for many people.What I liked it the most is the ending. When the family gets together, Susie is in peace. It is a message that the loved ones who leave us are at peace when the living find peace...As long as we continue to grieve and not live our life on Earth, neither do our loved ones enjoy their perfect Heaven...."
4,A good summer read,"I was watching a Today show segment on new books being released when the reviewer commented, ""If you only read one book this summer, this is the one."" I don't know that I would go quite that far, but this is, nonetheless, a good time. If your tastes lean more toward literature than useless drible like Danielle Steele, and you are on the hunt for a good, quick read while on vacation, then this is the book for you."
1,I thought it was just me,"A friend of mine literally forced this book on me to read this weekend, raving about it. The bad reviews here have just confirmed my own impression and I'm not going to bother finishing it.The major flaws are a dull, pallid writing style and characters as flat and cliched as the cast of a fifties' sitcom. There is not a single person in here I care about, least of all the murder victim.People ask why this book is such a hit. Because many readers can't recognize decent writing and like the idea that even the most heinous tragedy can be made painfree and feel good; after all, the victim is telling her story from heaven and the people she's left behind are getting on with their lives. If Oprah wrote fiction, this would be it. I loved the title by one of the reviewers, 'Touched by an Elbow.' That sums it up, perfectly.Atleast, this book was lent to me. Paying money for this? Now that's pain."
1,The Lovely Bones,"As everyone else on this site, I read this book with very high hopes. It started well -and I was intrigued by the voice and character of Susie Salmon. The idea for the book is also brilliant: the voice of a victim. But after the first chapter or so, the book wanders off into the lives of undeveloped, uninteresting characters. The people are similar to television actors: very rote, predictable and identified through their sex lives. I was interested in Susie and began to feel she was being set aside so the novel could develop the romantic/sexual involvements of everyone else. This is what turned a rather bold idea into a mediocre meandering. Which is sad, because a very brave idea becomes just another formula novel of sex being the only thing really interesting to anybody. I don't know about other readers, but picking up a novel supposedly focused on the rape and murder of a child hardly sets the proper mood for ""romance"". Extremely disappointing."
2,"Intriguing concept, but something's missing","Initially, I thought this book would be a very interesting read. The concept of a young girl narrating the story from heaven is very novel. The description of her rape and murder is graphic, scary, and attention grabbing. Unfortunately, by the end of the book, there is not a single reason to care about any of the characters. With the exception of the protagonist, they are flat and unidimensional. And if you don't feel emotionally attached to the characters, then it is very difficult to actually care about what is going on in the book. I read the first half of the book in a couple of days - - and the remainder seemed to take literally forever to get though. I must have missed something because the critics loved it."
2,Not a fan,this book was not my favorite. i did not like it one bit. It confused me and I had a hard time reading through it. I would not tell others to read this.
2,what was I thinking?,"It sounded like an intresting book; murder,speaking from the dead, but as the story unfolded I realized I was reading a adolesent romance novel.ugh!"
2,Doesn't measure up to all the hoopla,"I was excited about reading this book as I had heard so much about it and it had been selected as a featured book on Good Morning America. I found it to be very disappointing and downright stupid in some cases. The premise is interesting, but certainly does not live up to all of the hoopla."
4,"Lovely, Indeed.","I picked this up, partially because I read Sebold's first book, Lucky, and partially because the movie was coming out. I hate reading the book AFTER the movie, since you're viewing it all through the director's eyes, not your own. I wanted to experience this first hand.I knew I was in for a treat when I was bawling twenty pages in! I found myself wrapped up in the characters themselves and identifying with the main character, Susie, throughout the book. I was so swept up in the book that I could hardly put it down, I needed to get through to the end before I could put it away.The Lovely Bones is incredibly sad, moving, heartfelt, and tragic, all rolled into one... but in the end, it's a great read. Alice Sebold has done well with her sophomore effort -- I'll have to go buy her third book now!"
5,Wonderful!,"I have to admit, I was really busy the first three attempts I tried to read this novel, but it wasn't the novel, it was me. Once I had the time to really read it, I read it in one sitting. I love how the spirit told her story, which is how I like to write. The Lovely Bones is beautifully written and I'd love more by this author. I'd like to say I loved how the spirit came back into her best friend, and I was on pins and needles reading when her sister almost got caught. I'm not one who likes to tell the entire plot of someone's book. I want you to read it for yourself and let it unravel. You'll love it!"
5,If you have experienced loss and grief in your life,"You will find truth in this novel. I disagree with the readers who claimed to be disappointed after reading The Lovely bones because it did not live up to their media fed expectations or those more cynical readers who couldn't immerse themselves in the world of Susie Salmon. I found the book both heartbreaking and magical in its depiction of an imagined afterlife, of the grief experienced by the family of the murdered girl and her love for her family."
1,Unnecessary Sensuality,"This book was great in the beginning and I really loved it. But in the 2nd to last chapter, the descriptive sex scene was unbearable. This part absolutely ruined the rest of the book for me. This book is definitely not for younger readers, and it's worse than an issue of Cosmopolitan even for those older readers."
4,pretty good,"I loved this book. I know most people dont like it because its 'not emotional' but personally, I liked it better that way. I am a fan of books that don't try to get all mushy. Its more intresting to me when its cold cut and on the table. While I agree the the character devolpment wasn't brilliant, I did think the story was intriguing.I found my self crying tears of sorrow and of joy through out the book."
1,This book gives maudlin a new definition!,"Geez - what a book. The only reason I finished it was it was selected by a book club I belong to. What a piece of slop! And the point of it was_____? You tell me. Move over Jonathan Edward, Alice Sebold is leaving you in her wake....What a pointless exercise."
1,Disappointing,"Wow, what a disappointment. To borrow from several previous reviews this book is best summed up as an Afterschool Special - Teenaged Murder brought to you by Hallmark."
2,Overdone,"The idea of a ghost telling their life from the ""afterlife"" is overdone. No less the creepiness of a suspense novel based on rape & murder, from the very girl's point of view, doesn't lend a poignancy to her abbreviated life, but seems to capitalize more on the ""mystery"" of her demise and the suspense as to whether anyone else will ""get it"" before he is caught. Blah!"
3,Wish I could give 3.5 stars,"This is a book that had many bright points, but it was still a little rough around the edges.What didn't work for me:1- Sebold wanted to include a lot of back-information about her characters, but didn't know how to smoothly incorporate it into the story. A lot of it seemed random which brought the story to a hault in some places.2- Sebold kept dropping hints about how the story was going to end up... to the point the reader is convinced that there is going to be this big reveal. SHE NEVER DID IT. I was so mad about the way she ended the book or, better yet, where she failed to take the story... I through the book down when I finished it. I felt cheated.That said... I love that the narrator is dead. Very clever. I also enjoyed the insight on how family and friends cope after losing a loved one. I thought both of those elements were very real.I would recommend this book, but caution that your biggest question/anticipation throughout the book never gets satisfied."
2,Couldn't sustain my interest,"The author did a fine job with similes and strong verbs. I enjoyed her writing style. However, after 53 pages I got bored with the story and gave up. The setup was fairly interesting, but neither the characters nor the story hooked my emotions. The fantasy about Susie's heaven was dull fluff. I can't believe this was the top fiction seller of 2002. Was this an Oprah recommendation?"
2,Honestly I couldnt take this book..,"I was so pyched to read The Lovely Bones. But after the first chapter I was bored. I was in love with hearing Susies sadness and humor throughout the book but I was deeply confused. I had to stop reading the book because it got to be too much. I dont want to give away the ending but one word..whoah! I dont really recommend this book to anyone who cant stand blood, horror, and sadness. If you really want to read a book that makes you think and makes you worship your still living The Lovely Bones is the book for you."
2,Tedious,I read this entire book chasing the promise of the really good story this could have been - it didn't even have a good ending when I got there after wading through page after page of tediousness punctuated by a bright spot every now and then. Disappointing.
3,It's all about the first chapter,"The first chapter is so gripping that you have to keep reading. However, the rest of the book falls flat. The Lovely Bones owes much of its success to timing and topicality. When it was first published there were (sadly) a number of similar cases in the news, and I think that inspired more interest in this book. Beyond the first chapter it's fairly dull."
1,terrible book,"I had looked forward to reading this book for a while. The first third of it somewhat lived up to my expectations but after that it was terribly disappointing. I felt like the author was trying to sound clever and deep rather than just telling an interesting story in an honest fashion. It was bizzare and not in a good way. I was totally unsatisfied with the characters and what happened to them. There were so many things that I wanted resolved and explained. I realize that life doesn't often give us neat resolutions and explanations, but I just felt like this book needed SOMETHING to redeem it. It was disjointed after the first few chapters, and a better ending would have helped."
1,Very disappointing,"I thought the premise of this book had some promise, but I was very disappointed throughout. One of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was tedious and the narrative often confusing. I despised the ""reincarnation"" scene in which Susie, who was brutally raped and murdered at age 14, has sex with an old boyfriend. How did this book get published? Terrible."
2,Too Strange,"I read this book because someone dear to me wanted me to read it. I had no intention of reading it before. I have read a book similar to the premise of this book and I thought that book was enough. I knew from the first chapter that I would not enjoy this book. The victim is not a person I really liked. She was a teenager and her friends are teenagers. Their lifestyle is promiscuous as are most of the characters in the book. I did not grow up in such an atmosphere, so I couldn't identify with any of them. I didn't find the book uplifting or even exciting. I might want to see the movie out of curiosity."
5,Grief Taken to a New Level - Spell Binding,"A review on the cover says this is the kind of book that while browsing a bookstore you will want to stop by it, touch the spine and remember the emotional impact it had on you - I TOTALLY AGREE!! This is such a wonderfully moving, emotionally charged novel. I would like to applaud the author for her imagination and sensitivity to a VERY DIFFICULT subject. I was also amazed at how the story line didn't dwell in the usual anger and revenge theme but found the more realistic painful side of moving through the process of loss. Alice Sebold has given all of us a thought provoking, heart-warming story of Suzie Salmon and her family - a family we will never forget. Thank you Alice!"
2,overhyped!,"I found this book mildly engaging but contrived. The characters were stereotypical and one-dimensional; the situations were predictable. One scene, in particular, made me mutter ""Oh, come on"" outloud.At the risk of sounding like a snob, I have found that books this popular are seldom very good from a literary standpoint.This definitely fits in well with the Oprah type ""woman's voyage of self discovery"" tales."
2,"Great Writing, But Little Happens","There is no denying that Sebold is a terrific writer with great prose, but THE LOVELY BONES moves way too slow. The idea is interesting, and the way our villian is killed is fantastic. But for such a slow moving book to be such an amazing seller amazes me! Go figure."
4,Feminist angle needed?,"""Lovely Bones"" is a beautifully written take on the murder of a girl and its effect on her family. Sebold also manages to make a surprising literary device work: the narrator is the girl herself, now in heaven. Sebold provides some details about heaven, or kind of a pre-heaven, but is careful not to try too much (cf. to last chapter of Dara Horn's ""TheWorld to Come"" which I did not like at all).Sebold throws in a feminist angle (Susie's mother, also Ruana). While not done badly, I wonder if it may have been required only because Sebold's literary imagination needed another crutch; to my mind, it muddies the tragedy's after affects."
2,Great begining but I lost interest by mid way through,"The movie preview for this book looked like something I would enjoy. The begining was addictive, frightening, and beautiful but around the time her mother left home I lost interest. I guess I was just expecting something different...more like a mystery or something with suspense but it just dragged on."
2,Am I the only one?,"After all the hype, the strategic placement in book stores, and the lovely cover, my expectations were pretty high for this book. What a disappointment. Boring. Unbelievable. Characters (like the sister) whose motivations are unclear and whose actions are unexplained. An interesting premise (watching from self-created ""heaven"")that just doesn't gel. I never got the desired sympathy for the Mom, and never figured out why the Dad put up with her crud. Not a bad first novel... but am I the only one who doesn't get it?"
3,A unique premise,"Most readers know by now that The Lovely Bones is told from the perspective of a deceased main character, Susie, a young girl who has been brutally raped and murdered. Oddly enough, this seemingly emotion-ladden story comes across as vague and emotionless. Susie's narration is so matter-of-fact that much of the emotional impact of what she is describing is lost. The author portrays the reactions of Susie's family to her death in a very real and well-written manner, yet there is a distance there--perhaps the distance that Susie herself feels as she looks down on her loved ones from heaven. From Susie's perspective, we see heaven as a place that is wonderful yet also sad, as paradise does not prevent Susie from longing for those she left behind. The story meanders through many years, never quite reaching a point of conclusion. Although I found this novel to be disappointing, Sebold certainly has shown significant promise for the future, and I wouldn't hesitate to read her next book."
3,Great.....until the end,"I must admit: I am all about endings and as great as this book was from the very first paragraph, the ending ruined it for me. I won't give anything away of course but in comparison to the rest of the book I was very surprised. The writing is beautiful. Seeing the world from this little girl's eyes is so touching and heart-wrenching all at the same time. Was it worth the read despite the end....yes."
4,Good read,Good read. The ending left something to be desired though but it was a good quick read that held my attention throughout.
3,"Loved it at first, then it petered out","I was extremely impressed with this book when I first started reading it, but then it seemed like she didn't know where to go with the story and I felt the ending was very weak. The unusual premise of the book made me read a little about the author and eventually led me to her first autobiographical book ""Lucky"". I was surprised that she would end this book with a sort of happily-ever-after ending when one of the things that I took away from her first book is that survivors of violent crimes seem to carry it with them for the rest of their lives. Anyway, I would recommend this book but it does go a bit astray at the end. I'm also looking forward to reading more from Alice Sebold. If anyone does read ""Lucky"" it's very interesting to compare the author's real family to the family she's created in her fiction."
1,An Awful Disappointment,"After reading many reviews of this book -- and most of them were extremely favorable --, I bought it for myself, shortly after it was published. It was an ""interesting"" idea and good up until near the ending. Why, oh why, did the author feel the need for the ""sex with those on earth"" portion? It would have been better had the dead girl turn her back on earth and accept the ""heaven"" she had been dealt. I gave the book to 3 people and they all agreed that the ending was a dismal failure."
3,"Definitely a good read, but not great.","This book was not chosen for our Book Group selection, however, everyone in my book group had read it and loved it, so I went off to find a copy.At first, I was VERY impressed with the storyline. It wasn't your ""run of the mill"" murder mystery. There was a definite need to know what happened to Mr. Harvey, but I felt that somewhere during the latter 1/3 of the book, there seemed to be a bit of a diconnect in what was written and what I desperately needed to read. I felt letdown.Perhaps the letdown was a result of all the hype I had heard. Maybe my expectations were too high? All in all it was a good read, but I didn't find the sense of calm that I had hoped to by story's end."
2,Intensely disliked this book,"The book was really fine for the first 2/3, compelling crime story was a really nice contrast with the ethereal description of heaven. However, there was one event toward the end of the book that threw everything else off, it was disjointed and felt like it belonged in a completely different book (one of much lower caliber). It completely ruined the story for me."
2,Depressing Bones,"This novel is less about a murder of a young girl than it is about the effect such a brutal crime has on the members of the victim's family. Not sure we needed this novel to educate us on the fact that violent crimes scar more people than the immediate victims. And strangely, the book seems to suggest the victim is oh so lucky to have been murdered because she is so happy to be in her magical heaven. I give this book two stars instead of one because it is hard to shake and the author is very talented in telling her story. But, for me, her talents cannot overcome a story which has too many negative threads. For most, there's enough suffering taking place in the real world. But if you are the sort who likes downer books, you'll LOVE this one."
2,I am stunned...,"I am stunned that a) this book found a publisher and b) that someone paid for the film rights. The overly long and tedious story line had me resolving to simply put it down several times but I kept thinking that the next chapter would make it all worthwhile. I was so very sadly mistaken. I can certainly understand how people who have suffered an unbearble loss of a loved one would be drawn to the concepts of heaven on which this plot seems to rely so heavily. However, the concept is not enough to support a storyline overburned with one-dimensional characters. Even when they showed promise, Ms. Sebold lacked the skill to develop them. The ending seemed to me to be a sophomoric attempt to simply tie up the loose ends. I suspect Ms. Sebold received confirmation that some fool was negotiating for film rights. It shouldn't be surprising that a reading publich lacking both teeth & spines should find pablum such as this so easy to swallow."
3,Realistic story but needed more umph!!!!!!!,"I just finished reading the book and I can honestly say that everything that took place in the book was realistic. How the tragic event took place, the investigation, and the trials and tribulations of the family made the story more tangible and true-to-life. I also connected with Susie and her thoughts--I would be thinking the same way and hope that I can follow my loved ones (as closely) when my time has come. Finally, the subject is fresh from the headlines which makes the story come alive and even more practical.However, the story moved a little too slow. I wanted more suspense (more umph) when it came to the investigation and sometimes the author appeared rambling over the same subjects. The switch from heaven and earth was interesting but the switch from past to present was confusing at times.This book is a one-time-reader but a great example of first-person narrative and (if curious) the concept of life and death is clearly explored here."
2,new age hooey,"This book came highly recommended from several sources and had a lot of buzz. It turned out to be a lot of meandering new age hooey. The writing was pedstrian, the plotting was not much either. Thumbs Down."
4,The Lovely Bones,"I finished reading this book over a month ago but it has stayed on my mind since then. I thought it was an interesting premise -a murdered child up in Heaven continues to monitor her family. The devestation of the family is too real and I found myself crying on more than a few occasions while reading. But not to give the wrong impression, the book is not all gloomy & morose, it is thought provoking and as I already mentioned, very interesting.The only beef I had was with a surreal passage near the end - those who've read it know what I'm talking about...I had to re-read this section 3 times since it detracted from the otherwise excellent ""flow"" of the story. I mean, it'd be a good movie special effects portion but in a book setting, it was distracting & strange. Overall though, I'd highly recommend this book."
2,"Promising, but Disappointing","The Lovely Bones is a very uneven work. At times touching and memorable, at times monotonous, at times pedestrian, the prose of Ms. Sebold needs more polishing before it can be called great. Some of the plot turns are silly and forced, and the effect on the reader is one of annoyance. This would have made a superb first draft. I hardly know how to account for this book's phenomenal success; perhaps, as in the title of her first book, Ms. Sebold got ""lucky."""
5,Lovely Bones came from Heaven,"This is a GREAT book. I was touched by it from the very first chapter. I couldn't believe it! I found a book that reached out and grabbed me and pulled me in- so much that I did NOT put this book down! It is wonderful! The description of heaven is so believable, I read it over and over with tears falling down my cheek. I highly recommend this book to any girl over the age of 16. It is a wonderful book and you won't regret it!"
4,heaven isn't all that happy,"Susie Salmon is your average beautiful 14-year-old girl. In the beginning, we first find Susie in heaven, gazing down on earth after having been murdered. She is full of anxiety when she watches her distressed family go through the pain of not knowing where Susie&#65533;s body is or the killer. After many months following Susie&#65533;s death, the world begins to go back to its regular conventional custom. Soon Susie realizes heaven isn&#65533;t all that it is said to have been and her time just consists of watching the living and roaming around her own made-up world. I really liked this book, although the resolution took a while to come to being. Alice Sebold uses absolute description on every scene and emotion you encounter. You will really enjoy reading this book and the author&#65533;s view on the nirvana that was given to Susie."
2,this book is just not for me,The book was interesting in the beginning but then it kept switching back and forth from watching the criminal get away with the crime to the victim of the killer watching her family crumble down each day without a clue of who did this to her. This made me kind of bored because I would really get into the part of how the criminal was covering his tracks and getting away with it. And also how the police got close but lose the evidence. It made me start to lose interest and gradually I stopped reading book. I would recommend this book to whoever has the patience to rewrite and congrats those who made it through this book. Also if I had rewritten this book I would turn Susie's p.o.v. into a different book sort of like another side of the story but in a different book.
5,Fantastic,"This was a fantastic read! I saw the movie first and loved it so much that I bought the book. (Although, of course, the book goes into a lot more detail and is somewhat different than the movie in certain aspects.) The movie had such wonderful special effects that really bring the book to life. The book really makes you wonder about what happens when we cross over and are caught in the ""in-between"". Once you start reading this book, you'll have a hard time putting it down. Fantastic!"
2,"Good, strong writing, dull and lackluster story.","I picked up this book because of all the hype and good things I had heard about it. I was drawn in very quickly due to the author's excellent prose (no arguing, Sebold is a beautiful and brilliant writer), but lost interest very quickly. There's really no plot, no central STORY. Things are just kinda happening and while she describes it poignantly (though at times it was very cheesy and corny), it's just not engaging.Far from un-put-down-able, but it is read-able. It's just dull and lackluster. Good premise, promising author, but skip this book. You're not missing much. Check out Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes or My Sister's Keeper instead."
3,Interesting book but does not live up to pre-marketing hype,"I agree with a few of the other reviewers on two fronts: a) the book is an easy, quick read that is both interesting and engaging and b) I expected something greater based on the pre-marketing hype.I felt that Sebold could have left out the chapter where Susie had the opportunity to explore earthly moments (a la the movie ""Ghost"") and left it a better book. I found this particular chapter out of line with the character development and story line to that point."
3,somewhat of a letdown,"When I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, what you would call a page turner. But by the last quarter of the book I became very disappointed. Maybe I missed something but I've talked to other people who have read this book and they say the same thing I do. Read it for yourself and see what you think, I wouldn't call it a waste of time. All in all I have to agree with the first review, doesn't quite deliver."
2,All Over The Place,"I had heard great things about this book so decided to read it. I agree with a lot of the other reviews that say it started out really great and then fizzled out. I think the storyline was all over the place, and I couldn't understand what the point was, other than just to be a fly on the wall in the lives of Susie's family. I was also not happy with the bodily possession (a bit much in my opinion) or the weak ending. I think the concept was interesting, and I think I would have liked it better if it kept the same energy it had in the beginning. I did enjoy the fact that it was based in the Philadelphia suburbs, as I am familiar with that area."
3,Engaging and Unusual,I found the book to be engaging. The story was peculiar and innovative. It had a disturbing plot but it was written in a way that it wasn't overly upsetting. I read the book within 2 days it was one of those books you can't put down.
3,"Sad, gruesome, depressing but well written....","""The Lovely Bones"" was a well written book. I sailed through the pages almost at one sitting on a Saturday. It wouldn't be the way I'd like to spend another Saturday, as when the book ended, I was quite down.Many of the described passages in ""The Lovely Bones"" should have been left out. The gruesome details of murder were not necessary to the story. I felt truly sickened many times in this book.The author created an interpretation of Heaven from which the murdered 14 year old girl was looking down from that I enjoyed greatly. I liked the authors choice to make heaven something that you create for yourself. What a happy thought. The only one in the book, I think.I was left with a feeling of unfinished business when the story ended. I would have loved for there to have been closure. The hype was huge for this book, I expected more."
2,Pretty ordinary,"I think the one thing that makes this book worthwhile is the authors poignant and yet not overtly sentimental description of how the love and fondness within a family evolves over time. Other than that, I thought the book exploits our natural fascination with human tragedy (the voyeuristic tendency to want to glimpse into the life of people whose lives are more dramatic than ours) to pass off a rather poorly written story. The characters are prototypical and glossed over. The only relationship that I thought was explored or described to some depth was the one between Lindsey and her father.The book itself is reasonably interesting but I think the writing is merely passable. I think the book is overhyped and that one's time is better spent reading one of the classics!"
4,Thought-provoking narration,"Susie Salmon's life ends on the second page of the novel, The Lovely Bones, but she forges ahead to tell her story from the unsettling circumstances of heaven and the silent shadows surrounding her family and friends. Brutally murdered at the age of 14, Susie can only observe life on earth and the impact her death has on those who knew her. Susie sees and explains, but strangely, is not compelled to judge from her point of view. She watches as the tragedy takes its toll on her family, as her boyfriend seeks out a new companion, and her killer eludes the police.Alice Sebold's novel explores ""The Sixth Sense"" notion that the dead are among us, longing to be acknowledged and loved again, longing for basic human experiences. But that strand is secondary to the story of the emotional dismemberment of the family left behind. The Lovely Bones is a gently told tale of suspense that will have a lingering effect on any reader."
2,the lovely bones,"For the past 3 years or so, I have heard nothing but acclaim for The Lovely Bones, I just never took the time to find out for myself. However, this summer my teacher assigned this as summer reading. I was excited to see what all the buzz was about.But The Lovely Bones left me disappointed. I couldn't feel a strong enough connection with the story or the family. I didn't feel comfortable in Susie's ""heaven"", and the strange possession of Ruth's body weirded me out. The most exciting parts were the parts that got sort of murder-mystery on you.When I finished it, I felt like I should feel uplifted--but I wasn't."
4,2 sleep deprived yet worthwhile nights,"Started this at 11pm in the midst of an exhausting week and didn't put it down 'til pg. 139. Finished it the next evening. While it is true that the book shifts gears about half way through and the character development was limited in some cases it was adequate to make her point. Her stress was on the connections between both her live/dead selves, her family and her friends. She stayed in character with the concerns, priorities and observations of a 14 - 24 yr. woman in the 70's-80's. I appreciated the window and it rang true with my own perspective from those years."
1,I Thought I Would Never Finish This Book!!,"I really wanted to like this book, I had bought this book when it first came out and put it aside along with my other books that are waiting to be read. When I first started this book I knew that it was going to be sad, as I was reading along the story started shifting gears to another direction and that's were I got lost. I promised myself that this year I would finish a book that I start no matter how bad it is now I can say that I did read it and I was so disappointed in the end.Happy Reading Lisa"
1,Don't Believe the Hype!,"This week's (1/16/03) New York Review of Books has an excellent article as to why this book is so popular: some post-9/11 need for simplistic healing and soothing fantasy about life after death.Sebold is more of a poet than a fiction writer. That is, she's adept at spinning pretty images, rather than showing us the paces of a plot. The characters are cardboard cutouts, and by the time the ""dead"" narrator slips inside the body of her old schoolchum, I knew we'd entered rock-song teen fantasy."
5,Unique in every way,This book is wonderful and raw. It shows us a young girls brutal murder and how her family copes with it. It is all done in the perspective of the murdered girl. It is both beautiful and painful.
5,i loved this book!,"i read this book after both my dad and sister read it. i must say i was a little hesitant to read this book, becuase of the violent plot line, but i'm glad i actually read it. i finished this book in one day! it was impossible to put down. not only is the story line and the characters painfully compelling, but the story seems to leap right off the pages. unlike most people who read this book, my favorite part was when susie switched bodies with her friend on earth. i think it was a good example of susie finding her ""heaven on earth."" while the basic concept of the is book is one of violence, in my opinion it shows a great amount of hope. this is a definate MUST READ!"
3,An Okay read!,"I remember hearing great things about the book, so you can imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be okay. I thought it was sort of... well.. boring."
2,Dull ... Pointless,"I gave the book 100 pages ... there are too many books out there to be read to continue this.After those 100 pages I feel zero for the characters. I'm not sure why I'm following their daily routines ... the story seems lost and meandering. If the book is to show how people handle death, relationships post death, memories, etc., it does so blandly. I had no incentive to see read what's next."
3,"Okay, I guess.","The book was an okay read, I guess. I bought the book based on the fact that movie trailers looked interesting. It had parts that were sad, parts that made you angry, and parts that left you wondering what will happen next.BUT the book tended to skip around a lot and I fould myself lost at times. The most dissapointing part was the ending!!! I wanted him to be caught and when Susie came back to earth, I thought, this is it! Everyone will have the clues they need to catch the guy. But she doesn't do any of that at all. Instead she spends time having sex???? Come on! She doesn't go back to see her family, she doesn't give away clues to what happened to her, and at the end of the book...I found myself asking ""That's it?""I was looking forward to this book being suspensful and keeping you on the edge of your seat, except for maybe two or three chapters, it wasn't."
4,Deep and believable,"I thought the Lovely Bones was a great read, especially at Halloween time. I mean, the book is narrated by a 14 year old ghost so it's very fitting for fall.I loved the voice of the main character, Susie Salmon.I thought her voice was believable and mesmerizing. Sebold is great at eschewing cliché, which I truly appreciate. I found her writing at times very poetic and a little blurry around the edges. I like that.The one thing I found a little confusing was the way the 3rd person omniscient writing kind of floated around very fluidly. At times I had to remind myself whose voice I was reading.But overall I loved the point of view of this book, that heaven is what you want it to be, and that the ghosts can watch what is going on down here on earth."
2,:(,Book had a great start but halfway thru became slow and boring. The ending was very anti-climactic and unsatisfying.
2,Very Disappointed,"Once again, I fell for the hype. I assumed this book would be excellent because of all of the attention surrounding it, the movie etc. I thought that the book was going to be the story of a murdered girl who haunts her family through dreams to help them find her killer...and it was sort of, but not really. The book mostly is just Susie watching her family from her ""heaven"" after she dies, which is actually really boring. I was very disappointed with the ending of this book & was expecting more suspense and drama with ""Mr. Harvey"" (the murderer. Alice Sebold is a beautiful writer, but I woudln't recommend this book."
5,Fascinating Presentation,"I like the way Alice Sebold came up with putting the whole story within the framework of fantasy, beginning in heaven. That's what makes this book different and fascinating. If you liked ""The Lovely Bones"", I recommend that you next read another book I have read that is similarly presented, a book called ""West Point..."", by Norman Thomas Remick"
2,The Lovely Bones....,"This book was good. I had heard a lot of hype for it so I decided to head to the library and check it out. When I read it, I was horrified by the chapter about the murder and rape of this innocent young girl whose curiosity got her killed. The rest of the book was ok, but needed more substance. It should have gone more into her experience of heaven and left out the other characters. This book freaked me out and shouldn't have been hyped as much as it was. I do recommend it for adult readers, being that the main ideas were good, but not for younger children whose minds may not be able to handle the complex world of murder and rape."
2,DONT WASTE TIME,What started out as a page turner ended up just being boring. Dont be fooled there is no way this book should be rated 4 stars
3,Wonderful...until the last 50 pages,"I couldn't put this book down, and when I did, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. It was so moving and well-conceived. And then it fell apart. The last 50 pages seemed a cop-out, like the author just ran out of steam. There was no pay-off, which, although not strictly necessary, would have been one good way to end the story. **Negligible Spoiler Alert** My main problem was that I couldn't believe that, after everything we learned about her, the main character would behave the way she did in the end. It made no sense, and was actually infuriating. Maybe the author's point was that people are irrational or something. But I thought the end didn't fit the rest of this well-crafted, emotionally wrenching book. I would probably have given the book 5 stars if the ending had been even mediocre."
2,Eh...,"I'm a little bewildered as to why I was bored with this book somewhere from the middle to the end. I swallowed the beginning and thought it was extremely creative, but there were certain characters that I wanted to konw more about (Hal, Samuel, her father in his younger days) and some that were elaborated on too much (Ruth). I would've liked to have found out more about Mr. Harvey's back story. I was getting annoyed that it took so long for the police to gain evidence, but that was realistic. The problem I had with it is when important things like the bear, the necklace, and the hunter were mentioned, it was chapters before we found out the outcome. I guess I was looking for more Law n' Order, less La La Land."
4,Lovely book,"I loved this book, but found myself confused and not as interested in some parts of the story, especially the last quarter of the book. Overall though, it was a haunting and powerful story that saddened me, but kept me turning the pages. I liked the ending and the characters were believable. I loved the foreshadowing, and the poetic way Alice Sebold writes. I highly recommend."
1,Don't waste your time,"In one word, BORING. The beginning is ""gripping"" but the novel reads on like an after school special."
1,It had great potential,"The first several chapters deserve five stars. With more time and effort, perhaps the rest of the book would have worked out to something more satisfying. The characters became stick figures and the plot points ridiculous. A good editor would have helped."
3,mediocre novel that is overly-hyped,"The novel takes off from an interesting concept -- a teenage girl who has been murdered watches her family and friends from her own private heaven -- but it is a very flat read. The author does little but recount the movements of those on earth. The characters are never fully developed, the tensions not fully portrayed, and at times I found myself flipping through the pages to get to the end. There is a lot of potential here that does untouched. It's an okay book, but certainly falls far short of the tremendous buzz it has received."
1,Read a hallmark card instead,"This book is completely trite...While the idea is interesting, the execution is majorly lacking."
2,Two hours I can never get back....,"You know, I usually pass on the hyped-up books, but I heard such great things about this one for so long I figured there had to be something to the reviews. I was very wrong. As I read I kept thinking that something would happen soon that would make all the fuss pan out.I didn't enjoy reading this book, I didn't even hate it, I was bewildered and somewhat annoyed on every page. My most common editorial comment, out loud of course, was ""Oh, please!!"" while rolling my eyes and holding my stomach to prevent my nausea from overtaking me.There was no poetry of language, no spiritual connectivity; it was just depressing and irritating. Two hours I can never get back."
2,"Well Written, But.....","I'll make this short and sweet. It's a well written book, conceived in a poetic style that I have not seen in many books of late. The idea of a girl looking down upon her family after her untimely death is a very captivating and unexpected way to tell a story. So, why so few stars? Freudianism. The book starts as what is a fun, yet believable flight of fantasy, and lands just short of vulgar. It was a good story gone horribly wrong. By the end of the book, you'll have lost interest, being alienated by the blunt sexual references that are, in the end, more than just references. If you decide to read it, you'll be enchanted, then greatly disappointed..."
3,"Didn't like it, but also didn't hate it....","spoiler....I thought this book fell short of what it could have been. I was interested when I heard about this book that was from the perspective of the victim. I felt that the autor jumped around too much and was under-developed. The autor made the reader believe that the ""bad guy"" was going to get caught in the end, or that the body of the victim was going to be found, but in the end neither happened. Why develop the story this way and then not finish it? Furthermore, the part where Susie takes over Ruth's body and has sex with her first love was totally out of place in the book. Instead of going to her family and giving them some closer by telling them the truth about what happened to her, she has sex? I did not hate this book, and I am happy to have read it, but it fell short for me. I think I fell in love with the idea that the book was written from a different perspective, but it could have been so much better"
3,The Lovely Bones,"This novel is very gripping, and it kept me turning the pages for a few chapters. After maybe the sixth chapter, I couldn't take anymore. If you don't care for sadness and horror this book is not for you. The first two chapters,to me, were nauseating."
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"This book is a perfect example of how marketing can take a mediocre novel and turn it into the Must-Read of the decade. Ahem. Nice book, interesting perspective, but alternately overwritten and underwritten. Not satisfying at all. The lovely bones could describe every character in here, no flesh on them, everyone's a ghost of a character and the treatment of grief is superficial at best. Sorry, this one's overrated."
1,The story ended half way through,"The premise was what attracted me to the book. A story written from the view of a deceased teen, from heaven seemed to have great potential. And the book truly could have been wonderful. It feels like Ms. Sebold stopped writing about half way though. I finished the book only because I had nothing else to read at the beach. And that the book still is number one -- I can't explain it. Skip this one; there are plenty of good books to read. This is not one of them."
5,"Heartwarming, but definitely not saccharin","Since some other reviewers have provided a synopsis, I'll concentrate solely on my thoughts.A point of view so unique it sounds bizarre -- a teenage girl who is killed is the narrator as she watches her family and friends as they carry on after her death. This is not so strange!Instead, I found it hopeful and full of keen observation and understanding that had me considering life in a much more indepth way.Upon reading the last page, I could almost have cried with *joy*. What a beautiful story."
2,Mediocre,"I found myself skipping paragraphs towards the end of the book just to get to the end. I heard so many great things about this book, but it didn't do it for me. Although, I did feel for Suzie, I didn't cry as some of my other friends had. I found myself more interested in the non-existent forensics of the crime, etc."
1,Totally overrated,I read the reviews on this book expecting something really great. I was sorely disappointed. The idea is clever but it just doesn't work. I'm sure that someone will try to make a movie ot of the novel. Good luck! This is one that I really cant' recommend.
1,I didn't like it at all,"I can't believe that so many people liked this book. The way the story is told is interesting, but it wears off quickly. This is a story of a little girl who is murdered. There is no way to make this comforting to the reader or have us believe that good things can come from this. Yes life goes on, but for Susie it is over, no lovemaking with Ray while Ruth is gone that's for sure. Come on, this is all just too manipulative.."
1,"If I could give it 0 Stars, I would!","This book was a huge dissapointment! I was intrigued about reading the story of Susie Salmon, speaking of her death and her family from Heaven.I found, however, that the characters didn't seem real to me. The character development was so poor that by the time I finished the book I was like, ""So what!"". What a waste of my time and money.I am not sure what all the hype was about... this book just didn't do it for me. I was waiting for it to get good at any time, but it totally let me down."
1,Totally inappropriate for teens !!!,"This book starts with a sickly suggestive and accurate description of a rape and a murder. I can say that the rape was too close to home for me... as I was raped as a teen... and spent years dealing with my fear of men...Several weeks ago my lovely adopted daughter began to act out and have severe mood swings, lack of sleep, snuck out after midnight, totalled my car, tried to run away, and even told the police that found her that she had been attacked by me!Then I find my own adopted teenaged daugther, who had been raped as a toddler by her father, had been assigned this sick and totally inappropriate book by her English teacher. She has been haunted by only half understood memories... dredged up by this perverted book... and now she has to write a term paper on this disgusting book. Please don't buy it, or give it to teens to read."
1,ugh,I will give my unpopular opinion but this is how i really felt about this book. i HATED it if i could give it zero stars i would. I have read many books and this is one of the very few books i couldnt finish. It was poorly written and the characters were unrealistic and bland. The story really wasnt that great either dont belive all the hype you hear about this book its not all what it is cracked up to be.
3,I didnt like the way things turned out,The book started so promising. The story was bewitching but about half it all went loose and it wasnt that good anymore. I dont like how the author moved things around the characters. It was nice but I was waiting for a great finale and didnt get it.
3,boring,"After reading the first few chapters I started thinking...'I have to let my mom read this book'. But then the story dragged, and I began to skip a page until I was scanning chapters searching for anything new happening to the characters. This author took a unique approach about death but she couldn't keep my interest. My recommendation is to not bother reading this book."
4,Lovely Bones,I thought the the book called the Lovley Bones was the most interesting book that i have ever read in a long time. Don't get me wrong there were some parts in the book that were a little boring but overall this book was filled with a warm hearted good topic to talk about. The best thing about this book is that it caught my attention when i first read the first page. I suggest everyone should read this wonderful book.
2,This book was just okay,"I really didn't care for this book, at times it was a chore to keep reading. I only finished it to see what happened at the end and that wasn't even worth it. Total let down."
2,boring,"I've heard a lot of people speak of this book. Truthfully, I just couldn't get into it. The beginning grabbed me and then dragged me through the rest. It was painstaking to get through, very slow paced. Not recommended in my eyes."
1,Faulty Clasp,"Do NOT buy this watch!!While this watch is beautiful, the clasp that holds the wristband together is faulty.I lost this watch the third time I wore it. It fell off my wrist at some point when I was shopping.Of course no one turned it in! :-("
4,Great product!!,My daughter was potty trained at the begining of August and I was concerned about stopping at places that were not so clean. I ordered the potty and loved it! It comes in a bag that makes it easy to carry around if you go to the park or on the road. We love it!
2,potty on the go,"For this price, I expected the potty to have a plastic cup also. It's hard to spill pee out of a plastic bag."
5,LIFE SAVER for potty training!,"My 2 year old daughter is recently potty trained but she does not like to use the ""big potties"" when we go shopping. This thing is awesome! I just carry it like I would a diaper bag, go into the stall, she sits on it and goes right away! You can use any 4 gallon trash bag. We also use it on road trips and she can sit and go in the back of our Yukon anytime! She is tall for her age and she fits fine. It has made potty training while we are out and about an absolute BREEZE! Buy it, it's totally worth it!"
5,Perfect Postum Substitute!,"Since I can't afford the going rate for 7 oz of postum ($150) I found this to be an excellent replacement. Unlike most other coffee substitutes, this is made from barley, as was postum. I found it to be very satisfying and similar, but slightly better tasting in my opinion than postum."
1,Gould is a traitor!!!,"Gould is a paleoontologist who defends the truth of evolution, but possibly only for promoting his bolchevic agenda. In this book, he does not defend evolution in politics and ethics, but instead claims that fundamentalism (religion!) should be authoritative in these areas. What a disaster and betrayal! I like better (and recommend) books that maintain the truth of evolution in these areas, by people who are faithful to Darwin: Why Race matters (by Michael Levin); Race, Evolution and Behavior : A Life History Perspective (by J. P. Rushton); Mein Kampf; The Real American Dilemma: Race, Immigration and the Future of America (by Jared Taylor.); and the books by Richard Dawkins, a better defender of evolution, and true to Darwin."
4,"Could Have Been 5 Stars, But...","...Gould's writing style in parts of this work is a bit difficult to wade through. His premise, that science and religion can coexist peacefully, is well thought-out and presented logically. And his atheism doesn't show through as a distaste for religion. Rather, he recognizes the deep human desire for faith as somewhat of a given. He argues that science and religion operate in separate spheres of influence. Nature is the domain of science, while religion concerns itself with ethics and morality within the framework of a constantly changing world. Of course, our world would probably be a better place if all of us could accept Gould's proposal. But, in all likelihood, that day is far off."
5,Wonderful First Book(s),"My aunt (who is a kindergarten teacher) gave us these books when my daughter was 9 weeks old. We immediately started reading the books to her -- she is completely mesmerized by them. I've since tried to buy these books for other children. Unfortunately, ...didn't have them in stock. I plan to order a bunch to give out as gifts. These are wonderful books for infants."
5,A message from the compilation producer,"This essential second volume in our best-selling Classic Country series features 16 top five, country smashes, 12 of which, were number one! The latest edition features many of the biggest country hits from the '70s and '80s by some of the best selling country artists of all-time. Every. This all-new collection features instantly recognizable country classics. 12 of the 16 tracks in this collection were #1 country songs. Classic Country, Vol. Two features some of the biggest names in country music, including Johnny Cash, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Merle Haggard, and Mickey Gilley. The booklet features detailed liner notes on each artist, many of whom, are in the Country Music Hall Of Fame."
4,Decent for Price,"The lid was jammed shut when I took it out of the box, but after some manhandling I was able to open it. This was the only negative thing I found with the item. The springs are nice and tight and hold bills in place. Overall I am very pleased with the item"
4,"Strong box, weak lock","I'm treasurer for a non-profit civic club, and I wanted a storage box for our petty cash. I was looking for something to keep the bills and coins separate. The spring clips for the bills seem to be quite strong. The plastic insert tray with the coin ""bins"" looks like it'll work just fine, and there's room for my receipt book and pen also. As others have commented, the box is constructed of fairly heavy-gauge metal (mine is not misaligned), but has a cheap locking mechanism. I bought it for convenience rather than security, so the cheap lock doesn't bother me. I just wish there was some way to latch the lid without having to lock the box. There's a metal handle on top, and if you were to lift it with the box unlocked, the box would tilt open, and all of the coins would spill out."
4,Great lock box for storage more then for safe keeping.,"This lock box works perfectly for my small business during the summer but I wouldn't trust it as a safe or anything. It's main purpose is to make it impossible for a thief to just quickly snag your cash or valuables, it would NOT work as a safe seeing that someone could just walk away with it. Also, I was able to pick the lock with the simplest of lock picks and very little lock picking experience so, again, its not a safe."
5,Great!!!,Not only did the pkg arrive fast it is more than I expected. Not large/bulky just perfect for petty cash. I recommend...
5,An excellent product for the price!,"This is a very sturdy cash box, the prongs to hold in the bills are very solid. I appreciate the flexibility of the open bottom. The lock works well although I feel it is a bit obtrusive. I highly recommend this cash box, especially for the price."
3,interesting read,"This book is just as described. It gives a clear, non-sugar-coated story of a woman's surgical weight-loss story. Not the most fascinating read of my life, but not bad."
2,Outdated Style...kids can't relate to it,"Others have complained about the short cord, even though a safety feature, but more to the point is that few kids even see a phone with a cord these days. My son was 2 when he got it and is now 3 and rarely picks it up except for a moment or so. He'll push a few buttons, play some sounds and then move on. Another reviewer noted that the sounds don't come from the handset and it didn't matter to its function so we cut the cord off-- it simply is not realistic enough to be exciting to play with. The style of the phone is out of touch with what today's phones look like & how they work ... certainly there must be better options."
4,Excellent choice for the 1+ crowd,"I bought this for my 22 month old for Christmas. She loves pressing buttons and making stuff happen (Pooh's voice), and picking up the handset. Now that she's 24 months, she finally ""gets"" it when Pooh asks her to ""Call Piglet!"", and she presses the number 3 which has Piglet on it.Frankly, I'm not sure it's worth $19.99. That's how much I bought it for, at Walmart, but if this is your price range and you want a toy for a child who is at least 18 months of age, and maybe up until age 3, then this is a great one, in my opinion."
2,Breakable,"This is not very durable, the lock is easily broken. I would not recommend this product. You get what you pay for and this was a waste of money."
4,"not too secure, but cheap","very thin boxes, i could probably get it open with a shoe. for the price, it's what you would expect."
3,Not as heavy/high quality as the picture looks.,"Based on the picture I would've assumed this to be a little more heavy/high quality. The chain is tiny. 17"". I purchased this as a gift for my husband who travels a lot, but he definitely won't be actually wearing this."
3,"NOT BAD, NOT GREAT BUT NOT BAD!","This is a kung fu movie about this seemingly invincible kung-fu master who has only one weakness. The fighting scenes are o.k., nothing spectacular but its a good movie to watch. I was a bit disappointed how the bad guy dies in the end but except for that, the movie was overall o.k."
4,Comfy seat,It's very comfortable and looks like a quality seat. I usually bike about 20 miles at a time and have no problems with it.I just removed the mounting brackets it came with and used the ones already on my bike from my old seat.
4,Nice seat!,"Very comfortable and seems well made, haven't got to use it yet on a long ride, but it's soooo much better than the one I had. Best price over anywhere else also."
3,need better design or material,"I was pleased initially b/c it is much better than my worn out 20 yr old saddle. However, possibly due to cheap material.. the seat area where my pelvic bone sat sank lower than the front which applied pressure in areas where I prefer relief. This happened with just one short 14 mile test ride. I will not recommend this to anyone else unless you just want a cheap seat for maybe a 5 mile or less stroll once in a while."
2,I'M NOT A GENIUS!,"This is an extremely complicated piece of machinery. I have not gotten it to work the way it is supposed to yet. The instructions are ""Yeh"" long, with sub-function instructions that are not clear. I even called the company and their technitions had to look up the instructions and they were not sure how to set it up. I'm a senior citizen, but not a dummy. I want to use the watch predominately as a pedomiter, but it cuts off after a minute. I have tried to set it up like the instructions say but it is frustrating. Too much of a good thing. Sorry. Not satisfied, but I'll keep trying."
2,give Tech 4.0 a 10.0 for user UNFriendly,Not happy with the ease of use.Very confusing when trying to set the pedometer to calculate steps.I was planning on returning it but have been so busy the last couple of weeks but this was a great reminder!!Thanks--I'll package it up and send it back this week.
2,"Great watch, but not water resistant as advertised","I walk and hike and swim, and the pedometer and other functions work really well, but after two sessions in the pool the watch display no longer functions. I'm hoping to be able to exchange it."
1,Hugely disappointing.,I was very disappointed by this book. The historical information is vague (and a lot of it weirdly christian oriented) and the crafts are nearly all things I could see fashioned by 1st or 2nd graders.
1,Misinformation Galore,"At first glance, I thought this book would be helpful when I spied it on the bookshelf at my local bookstore. However, when I opened it to the introductory chapter I learned that the culture which gave the name Yule (the Norse) where not even mentioned...at all. I finally found a blurb about them in the paragraph on mistletoe. But the story pertaining to mistletoe and the god Balder was completely wrong. All in all, when I flipped through the rest of the book, I found that if I did about a week's research online and in a few books, I could've done a better job with this than she did."
3,Disappointing.,"I tried very hard to like this book; the author seems so knowledgeable and pleasant, and I love the idea of this series, one book for each sabbat. But this is the first book I can remember that has both not enough information and too much. The author assumes one knows traditional pagan mythology such as the defeat of the holly king, so she doesn't retell the tale. It would've been nice to have a beautiful retelling and a section about this myth. At the same time, she goes on and on with craft projects, as if what the modern pagan is missing from her life is another way to create a wreath. When she writes charms, her rhymes seem painfully forced to me. And it doesn't do me much good to have an author say: this is what I do with my family to celebrate the holiday - do whatever you want. I finished this book with a feeling of dissatisfaction and vague confusion. I expected better than this."
3,Heady and Pretentious But Delivers,"Personally, this was my first book for this genre'. Didn't care for it much, but most of my classmates (Graduate level) did. Swick writes his travel stories with dialogue, which is missing from most travel genre's. This is really a different style and the dialogue brings his story-telling to life. If you don't mind the pretentious and sometimes pompous this is a well-written book. Swick also believes that the people in travel writing are often forgotten aspects--this is written from the perspective of a traveler...not a tourist. If you love story-telling, this is the book for you."
1,Swisher Deluxe Trimmer/edger,"I'm well pleased with this item, came fully assembled except for handle. Just add oil,fuel and cutter strings, you are ready to put the finishing touches to the yard or tackle the rough.I previously owned another manuf. unit and find the Swisher to be better built plus having the option to adjust angle of cutter head and edger position. As a senior with lots of aches and pains this big wheeled trimmer/edger with electic start fits my needs and allows me to maintain my property."
5,on the go ponies breezie,"Breezie is a very cute pony with yellow hair and pearly white body. Her cutie mark on her right hip is a picture of a tree with flowers blowing in the air. She comes with a scooter and lots of accessories including purse, brush, flag, apples, drink and a little map. I recommend her for anybody who loves ponies."
3,Too Much Physics,"What can I say about this book? This book is ok. In my opinion, this book discusses the science aspect of judo too much. I would say the first 2/3 of the book is nothing but physics text.The last 1/3 of the book gives step directions for many judo throws, some chokes, and some pins. Again, nothing special here.In conclusion, if you are looking for a book for insight on the practice and application of judo I would skip this one. If you are fascinated with science then this book is for you."
1,I'd really beware,"I'd be very wary of the two previous reviews, if you are like me you look around and read reviews from all over. ( you really should) then you will notice there are sites with these very SAME reviews word for word and at various different vendors sites.. now lets just think about this.. how freakin much would you have to LOVE a product to take the time to go to all the vendors all over the net, and COPY AND PASTE your ""heartfelt"" and ""it's so obvious"" review on all these different sites. nah that's not happening .. NO ONE is doing that.. UNLESS THEY ARE GETTING PAID or own the freakin company. disregard the above reviews and go see if you can try one out at a store near you.. OR wait until you can read some real reviews. After seeing this obviously questionable practice I'd really read that warranty card and make sure you can get a refund too."
2,Well it worked ok but........,"it broke on me in about almost a week or 2 after i bought it, i was going to use it and pulled back the slide to cock it and it got stuck, so i hit it slightly but not hard and it went back into place but as soon as it did the clip fell out, now i thought i just hit the button by mistake so i went to put it back in and it fell out again so i took it apart to see if i could find the problem, and there was a piece of plastic missing which i guess it helped to keep the clip up there, so i dont know id like to either get money back for it, or ill just boycott all your stuff"
1,horrible,"The only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say, cool. well it cant even shoot, so its not cool. this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic, and i looked inside its only held together by the outside. the laser is off target (and sucks)and it shots as fast as u can throw it, if it shoots. I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it."
5,Lots of Help for Publishers and Would-Be Publishers,"Mack and Sara Smith have created a down-to-earth, useful guide for anyone contemplating publishing. From the reality check on whether you should write and publish a book, to the resources to help your project succeed, you will find lots of useful information.Two of the areas in which this book excels are the information on e-books and e-publishers and the extensive appendix of resources. Many of the resources, such as organizations, are of special interest to women and minority writers.If you are thinking about publishing a book, start by investing in this book. It can save you time and money and help make your project successful."
1,bad transaction,"This was clearly advertised as a set of 12 at the time I purchased, as the seller acknowledged, but they refused to honor that ad, saying it was a mistake. I won't be doing further business with them and recommend other buyers beware unless and until they get a different philosophy of customer service."
2,Overpriced in my opinion,"This product costs $6 for only ONE wire. Bell sells aBell Bike Fix Cable Setfor about the same price, but it has 2 brake and 2 gear cables. That set also comes with the outer plastic coverings. In my opinion, for everyday normal use, the Bell package is much more bang for your buck than this."
2,Poor quality,"I bought four of these and liked them for a few weeks until the push button locks stopped working. That means keys are required at all times.When I lost a key it took me less than 30 seconds to break one open with a screwdriver. This is ""convenience security"" only."
3,Not secure at all,The keys are toys. You can easily pry up the safe box by a screwdriver (although it permanently damages the box). Fine for household use where you trust nobody seriously wants to steal your stuff. Otherwise.... You're on you own.
1,An Unlockable electronic Lock. Go figure.,I have had this object for several weeks and no matter what I do the dratted thing will lock only with a key. The digital function doesn't function. I'm very sorry I bought it. It has some potential as a fireresistant unlockable box but ... Don't bother.
1,Awful- A child could break into this.,"I've had this for a couple months and would return if I was still within the return window.Very easy to pick the lock- but that isn't even necessary. Even when locked, the cheap plastic gives enough leniency to simply lift the ""locked"" top off.While this might give off the appearance of security, if anyone tried for more than 1 minute, they would be able to open and take off with the content."
3,Satisfied with it so far,"Alarm is loud, would be easy to defeat by shorting out the wire cable, good deterrent but wouldn't use it to lock up something extremely valuable."
5,Excellent option to bose.,"Bought the high end set of Bose. Used for the flight home and again at home while doing homework. The price tag of $370+ made me wonder if I could justify the cost. After realizing I could purchase an outstanding pair of NC headphones for use during frequent flying (once per week at this point) and to effectively block out 85% of background noise during my daily study times, I opted for this pair due to the overall customer reviews on Amazon. I am not, in the slightest, disappointed. If you, like me , need NC headphones but either are on a budget or can not justify the expense equivalent to 2/3 of your car payment , you will not be dissatisfied.But buy Bose first, so you can take the extra time of trying and returning them, waiting for your credit company to process your return. Only then buy this set at a much better price. You will feel better in the morning if you do."
4,Replaced adaptor,The adaptor that came with the phone did not fit all applications so the service dept sent me an extra one.Great service.
3,Sound leakage a real problem,"These are good headphones - and they certainly work well without the noise-reduction turned on. But they leak sound like a sieve - and in doing so, sound like cheap computer speakers to the person beside you. And it's really too bad, because they're decent cans. But there's some mean irony if you're trying to block out noise, and you've ended up adding to everyone else's. ...unless you're into that kind of thing."
3,ok but ....,I've had these headphones for over 5 yrs. and while they have great sound and ok noise cancelling ability they're tight. I wear them at work and the very tight fit is uncomfortable. After 2 hours you have to take them off to give your head and ears a break. They also eat batteries - about 1 a month with 6 hrs usage 5 days a week. So I'm looking for others but haven't decided yet.
5,Better than Bose,"very nice, sturdy and comfortable. Less pricey than Bose but every bit as good. Has 2 settings for normal and for noise cancelling. Sound is exceptional!"
4,great noise canceling headphones for travel,"While searching for noise canceling headphones I was intrigued at the many positive reviews on Amazon along with the low price! At first I was skeptical that these headphones would compete with the ""Bose quiet comfort"" series but they did! They sound great and unlike the bose, these headphones pass audio through even when the noise canceling is off or the battery has died. The package includes a nice traveling case along with the various adapters you would need to interface this with a airline seat! Along with the very important fact that it uses standard AAA batteries unlike the newer Bose which uses a proprietary $65 battery! With the Audio Technica the battery drain was never an issue for me, on just one single AAA battery I made a long LAX to Australia flight and still had battery life left over for a few days in Sydney. The leather ear muffs are very comfortable as well.Very happy with the purchase!"
4,Audio Technica 4 Star,I purchased the Audio Technica rather than the Boise which I have had in the past primarily because of the price!! A review I read rated Boise best overall but that was primarily due to how compact the unit was. Having used noise canceling units for years I am very happy with the purchase. The Audio Technica worked well and the sound quality was excellent.
5,Great earphones!,"I bought these for my trip to Italy, to use on the plane. They are great. Definitely worth the money."
3,"Excellent value, but.","Just received the Audio Technica ANC7. Everything was excellent as advertized: sound, construction, ease of use, noise cancellation, etc., but after 20 minutes of listening, the cartilage on the upper rim of my ear hurt. I own a pair of Sennheiser HD 595s, which I love. I measured the vertical diameter of both headsets. The Audio Technica is a touch over 3.5 inches, while the Sennheiser is 4.5 inches, and that for me is the difference between comfort and not. Several reviewers had mentioned the discomfort on the ears. Now you have measurements for comparison with your existing headphones perhaps. Hope this is helpful in making your decision."
3,Very good with one exception,"These are a great set of headphones but they are a little small. I have a pretty big head and they were a too tight. Actually, they were tight enough that they made me nauseous and gave me tremendous headaches.I had to send them back. I bought the same exact headphones but the in ear style (ATH-ANC3) and they are awesome."
2,Somewhat Fragile,"Be sure to use the carrying case! I put them in my laptop case and, after a few years (beyond the guarantee, to be sure), the yoke for one of the earphones broke. so be careful."
2,"Sound great, but fell apart","These headphones sound as good as the reviews say -- they are fabulous. But, they started to break down after a year of use. The plastic on the headband broke, and the ear pads fell apart. I contacted the company, and they said they'd replace the ear pads for $30.I had a pair of Sennheisers for 20 years, but the Audio-Technica lasted a little over a year. Again, the ATH-ANC7 headphones sound great, but I will never buy Audio-Technica again."
1,Noise when Cancel-Noise Function Active,"I was really convinced that this would be a steal: great reviews, 1/3 of the price of the Bose one. Feeling like the smarter guy in the room. Unfortunately when I turned the noise-canceling function, left ear immediately started a static noise (my wife described as sea-breeze noise...). Its being returned.Other than that, everything else was good. Maybe I'm just unlucky."
1,Delivery was guaranteed but did not arrive in time.,"I ordered these noise-canceling headphones specifically for an international flight I was to take the following week. I ordered them 2nd day delivery ""guaranteed"", to be delivered by Friday. The headphones did not arrive by the following Monday, and I did not have them in time for my flight. I was not reimbursed for the late delivery. This was a poor performance by Amazon and UPS."
3,Hard on the ears,"The audio features of the headphones work as advertised -- audio reproduction is just fine with my MP3s, and the noise cancellation is excellent in both office and airplane settings. The only problem is that my ears hurt after ~2-3 hrs of continuous wear due to the physical pressure of the headphones. Big-headed people beware! This would likely be fixed if the manufacturer added just a little more expandability."
5,Awesome headphones,"After researching headphones from many brands, I decided to buy these headphones after reading the reviews here; and I'm glad that I brought these instead of the Bose. These are half the price of the Bose ones and work just as well. I took these over to Afghanistan and they have been through almost anything. I've been able to sleep on airplanes including C-130s, C-17s, chinooks & blackhawks. They are very comfortable to my ears; almost a perfect fit. These are just awesome headphones."
2,Noise Leakage,"It's hard for me to believe that Audio-Technica thinks that the amount of noise leakage out of these headphones is acceptable. The leakage only happens when the noise reduction is turned on, but my wife could hear my music clearly from at least 6 feet away from me. I don't want to be that guy on the plane that's annoyingly listening to his music and forcing everyone to listen to it too. I had to return them even though they did sound good."
5,Audio Technica vs Bose Quiet Comfort,"So I bought the Bose Quiet Comfort 2's and these and tested both and decided to return the Bose for the following reasons:*Bose make this ultrahigh pitched sounded that caused a sense of noticeable head pressure when you worse them. No such head pressure with the audiotechnical.*The construction of these were much better*After 2 weeks of use, I had to replace the bose batteries. I've used the audio technical for over 2 months without replacing them (same usage).*Price was much better on these (I got them for under $90 on amazon in december).*Use them as a consultant since travel a lot of airplanes and perfect!"
4,Nicely Quiet,"I tested these the first day in my convertible on the highway with the top down. Interestingly, road and wind noise was drastically diminished but I could still hear the radio, playing on the car speakers. On airline flights the same effect. Turn on the cancellation and a beautiful calm quiet comes over, but you can still have a light conversation or speak to the flight attendant. Plug the iPod in though, the rest of the world drops away and its all about the music. I find the sound quality is superb for both music and spoken word. Well worth the money for travelers, but make sure you shop as prices seem to vary by as much as $100."
3,Somewhat unimpressed,"Given the raving reviews on this product, I was expecting something impressive. It turns out to be somewhat a disappointment. In terms of look and comfort I have no complaints considering the attractive price. However, the noise cancellation function doesn't work as well as Bose QC2 or QC3. At the same time the sound quality is also quite far from satisfactory. Music feels muted and lack of clarity.The unit I received may also be defective. Sometimes when I turn on the noise cancellation the blue LED doesn't come on and noise cancellation doesn't kick in. I have to retry it a few times to make it turn on. Not sure yet if I'm going return this one.In summary:Pros:1. Good price2. Comfortable3. Can be used with noise cancellation turned off4. Looks good enough for the priceCons:1. Muted high and lack of clarity2. Noise cancellation doesn't work as well as Bose QC2/QC33. In my particular case, on/off switch may be defective"
1,"Worked great for a 2 months, and then....","and then the right ear producing static. The static gradually worsened over a couple of days, and then changed to a horrible ear-piercing screeching.Usage: daily, on my commuteProblem occurs: when noise canceling is on screeching occurs. When it is off, the right speaker is very, very weak compared to the left.Experience with vendor: does not return emails. Do not want to waste time, so will try my luck with the manufacturer.Overall: a risky buy because the defect exists, and the seller (Expo) is not inclined to assist the customer."
3,Received a different model than what was advertised,"I received the newer model, even though I paid more for these - the original model, which was what was advertised. I returned them, and my husband bought me a set of Bose headphones like his."
4,Pleasant headphones,"Having read a number of reviews comparing these headphones favorably to the Bose Quiet Comfort phones, and not wanting to lay out the $450 wanted for Sennheioser's PXC-450s on cans I use for workouts, I went with these.The sound is airy and open, much better than cheaper noise-cancelling headphones from Skullcandy that I have owned. The finish and construction are nice, but be forewarned that these are made in China, not Japan. Volume is boosted by turning on the noise-cancellation circuitry, and the headphones block out quite a bit of sound even with no music playing, so I think you will be satisfied with that feature. They are excellent for cancelling the noise of my treadmill.In sum, they are good for the price ($139 on Amazon) but they are no sonic match for audiophile headphones like Grado SR325is."
3,Hurts My Ears - Bose QuietComfort 15 are Far Better,"I have used these headphones at least once a week on airplanes for the past year. I am generally pleased but I am thinking about replacing them because they hurt my ears after a few hours of use. Also, they do not completely block out the noise of fellow passengers or the airplane motors. November 2009 Update: I recently had a chance to try the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones. I found the Bose to be much more comfortable and far superior at blocking out noise."
3,Good for sleeping. Bad for listening,"I bought these headphones after reading a review in Wired. That reviewer said these headphones were excellent, with no hiss. The reviewer needs to get his ears tested. I found the hiss to be very noticeable.My roommate bought Bose headphones with noise suppression. The hiss was much better. I would be happy to use them for music. However, they are not as comfortable on the ears.But I needed the headphones to cancel noise while I slept. And the Audio-Technica headphones are very comfortable to wear. I could sleep all night without discomfort! Even sleeping on my side!! Since I didn't really *need* them for listening to music, they met my needs, at least in the short term.If they had also been good for music I would have rated them 5 rather than 3."
3,"Great Headphones, but Noisy for People Around You","I just returned my pair of these headphones to Amazon.On the plus side,+comfortable+sounded great when noise canceling was turned on+seemed to be well madeOn the minus side,-with noise canceling turned off, the sound was duller-with noise canceling turned on, THE PHONE RADIATED A LOT OF NOISE. My officemates who were sitting 5-10 feet away complained about my music (which wasn't on very loud) distracting them from their work-the instructions say you can't use rechargeable batteries."
5,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 noise cancelling headphones,"These headphones are GREAT. I bought them after reading a review of noise cancelling headphones in the Circuits section of the NY Times. The reviewer rated them as good as Bose without the marketing campaign. He was right. I use them on airline flights, and while I'm reading when my husband is watching the Yankee game. I have already recommended them to lots of friends."
1,Sad but True...,"I was very surprised when the left channel stopped cancelling noise completely after a month of very little use. I didn't fly with these phones, or blast music through them. I quietly played jazz on my computer through them while I worked at home. Then the left phone cut out cancelling, and I hear a sound similar to a constant mild whoosh of air. I bought my wife a set at the same time, and hers still work. Although I believe Audio-Technica is a fine brand name, and I have used other headphones manufactured by them for 15 years at a time, these ATH-ANC7 broke on me, and I can't recommend them. I could not get a refund from Amazon either, as the warranty had expired."
5,Great Deal,"These headphones are a great deal for the price, especially if you don't want to shell out the money for Bose.Clear/dynamic sound, very comfortable fit(I wear them at work for hours at a time and forget they're on), and good noise canceling. I love 'em!"
4,Noise Reducing Headphones,These are great. After a trip from California to Romania and back they allowed me to get several hours of uninterrupted sleep. I've tries the Bose and these work just as well
1,Total FRAUD by Pavilion Electronics LLC (Dave Parkers),"Even after reading several other people say they had received the 7B after ordering the higher-rated (and more expensive) 7, I decided to give it a shot. Well, I was defrauded by Pavilion Electronics, as well. I paid $146 for the headphones, but I received the $129 pair today.To Amazon, your credibility suffers dramatically when you let partner vendors defraud your valuable customers. Please don't let Pavilion Electronics continue to do this!"
4,Excellent for Music Mixing,"Note: the only reason I did not give this a five-star rating was that I have not tried these phones while flying, so I cannot judge the noise-cancelling option.That said...These phones ROCK!When mixing music (Pro Tools LE), these are almost as good as some of the best nearfield monitors.The frequency range is mind-blowing!LOW lows and HIGH highs.Aside from mixing, I have also used these phones on my iPod.I've heard these songs over and over with other headphones...but when I started using the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7, I heard instruments and backing vocals I'd NEVER heard before.A-MAZ-ING!Worth the price...actually, better than some other brands at twice the price (I tried out several other high-end phones that lacked the dynamics these do)."
5,I know I'm late to the show here,"So there's even a newer model of this set out.I do my homework checking out both the new and original models.I decide to go with the possible better sound of the originals, plus of course, they're cheaper.I found a set on Fleabay where the seller said he'd worn them 5 times and they looked like that might bethe case in the pics.These cans are everything everyone says they are, THEY ROCK!I have larger ears I think and I had no problems getting a good seal with the cushions.I found mine for $58 shipped and as late as 5/17/11 there were still people selling sealed boxes from the factory or like new for < $75 shipped.I am sitting here as I type wallering in their noise reduced cushy awesomeness.These truly are the kitties jammies."
2,BAD sound leakage!,"I read about 25 reviews about the Audio-Technica headphones before purchasing them and felt confident that I was getting a great set of headphones, well...they may have great sound inside the headset, but for the person next to me to able to hear what I was listening to was unacceptable. I did not even have my iPod at 1/2 volume and others sitting next to me could hear the songs!"
2,Very Uncomfortable,"While I was very excited to receive these after reading all of the great reviews I must say I was terribly let down. The carry case that comes with this item is very nice and I appreciated the extra Aux cables. However, the fit was HORRIBLE. Now, this will certainly be subjective based on the shape of your head but its pretty common sense just looking at them in person that the fit is going to be strange. They slide open horizontally instead of vertically so they put some serious pressure on the top of your head which in my case led to a headache. I read on Cnet that the design angles were somewhat strange but I figured I would see for myself. Very disappointed.Note: I really can't say much about the sound quality because I didn't use them long enough to get past break-in. They were just wayyyy to uncomfortable."
4,Great for years but will eventually fall apart,"I've had these for about 5 years. For the past year, they have slowly fallen apart and I've added more and more electrical tape to hold them together. Around the pivots and adjustments, the plastic has cracked and they would fall apart if not held together with the tape. The cord has also separated at its end and has exposed wire.I agree with all the positive reviews. I keep adding more tape because I love these headphones no matter how they look. Just don't expect these to last more than 4-5 years with daily use."
4,"5 Star Preformance, 3 Star Commutable","Setting aside that these are not small, not stylish, and not attractive to wear, they are great performers.If you are more concerned with how you look, go buy some Shure earbuds. If you want something that is going to deliver excellent sound (rather, as excellent as it need be for being on a plane) and block out noise. These are the ones.I'm so used to taking my headphones off on a plane to be pleased by how quiet the engines are relative to my music volume. When I take these off, the jets are overpoweringly loud, even though I could hear perfectly. Personally, I only plan to use these on the plane, and for that purpose, they are ideal. For my day to day commute, I still use ear buds."
5,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7,"I am used to my roomy Sennheiser HD580 headphones. The ear cups of the ANC7 headphones are smaller, and seemed uncomfortable at first, but I may be getting used to them -- I think you just need to learn how to fit them on your ears a little more carefully than bigger ones.The closed back that helps the ANC7 keep out noise also keeps in some heat, so they are warmer than the open-back HD580s.The HD580 Sennheisers are pretty highly rated for sound quality, and although I am not an expert, I noticed that the ANC7s are also pleasing to the ear as I switched the two pairs back and forth for several hours this afternoon while listening to the subtle music of Mississippi John Hurt.I have never used noise canceling technology before, but it seems to work as described.-T"
2,Not worth the money,"I was just given a pair of these for my birthday, and I have to say they are going right back.With Noise canceling turned off everything sounds muted and not even close to the quality that my $20 Sony's do.With Noise Canceling turned on, suddenly everything is bright and crisp and almost, but not exactly hiding the static.Now, if I want static, these are great, if I want to always run the noise canceling, they are outstanding. But, otherwise, I would never recommend them."
2,"Static noises, small, heavy... buy the Bose","I bought these here on Amazon based on positive reviews, but I regret it. I own the Bose QCII, and wanted a second pair so my wife & I wouldn't fight over ""who got the good headphones"" when watching movies on a plane. But I regret the purchase; I should have sprung for a second pair of the Bose.*) The earcups are too small -- and I have very small ears!*) They are noticibly heavier than the Bose*) And finally, most important: They produce frequent bursts of ""static"" when playing dynamic, fast moving music! Very annoying!"
5,Great product and customer service!,I recently received these as a gift and they are fantastic. Well we also got a puppy recently who decided that the cable running to these headphones would make a nice chew toy.So I called up Audio Technica and they are shipping me out a new cable for free. Awesome company!
2,Noise cancellation headphones,"These headphones fit OK and sound good with the noise cancellation feature turned off. When it is turned on, two things happen. One, the sound goes very tinny and the bass goes away, thus the sound quality goes way down. Secondly, the sound leakage is terrible and a person sitting next to me can hear what I am listening to just at a medium volume level. I wish I didn't buy these online and tested them out first. The noise cancellation is fair, so I gave this a generous 2 stars, however, I would not recommend these to anyone unless I hated them."
4,"good price, good function, good feel","I purchased these headphones to use in cubicle-land at work. As expected, the noise-cancelling feature does not work well on the human voice. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find they block out the noise from our ventilation system which I was not even aware of. This allows me to use a lower volume for my music, resulting in less discomfort, headaches, etc. I find them comfortable to wear. The cord length is adequate for use at my desk. I can't think of anything negative to say about these phones, except that the price seems a little high. I paid just under $100. I would like to know how the cheaper models compare."
2,Horrible noise canceling,"I hope this is only an individual case of technical failure, but the right speaker of my headphone has NO NOISE-CANCELING. Moreover, it appears to me that the control system some how messed up and the right speaker actually plays with a lot of noise sometimes. When you turn the noise canceling off, the sound quality is actually descent. Overall, I am very disappointed given the price I paid."
4,Excellent Product,"Headphones work great. Noise cancelling is fantastic for planes. I have never used the Bose version so can't compare. My kids love them and it is nice for travelling, because they can watch movies etc.. without having to blast the volume. Travel case is nice. We ended up purchasing a second pair, and haven't had any issues. I highly recommend this product."
5,Great job at cancelling noise!,"I decided to purchase these headphones after reading the great reviews on Amazon. After I received them in the mail, they were everything i hoped for. I use them at work since my cubicle is right next to a high traffic area. They cancel out the noise very well. I haven't tried out the Bose headphones, but I imagine they can't be THAT much better than these (at least not worth 2-3 times the cost). The only thing is that they aren't the most comfortable headphones after wearing them for a few hours. The headband and earphones is a bit uncomfortable, but they're fine for me. I definitely recommend them!"
3,A fair noise cancelling head phone - affordable,"Farewell, my Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 headphone, after 4.5 years (~220 hours of actual wearing). While it physically still looks intact, it produces clicking and some other constant noises now. The noise canceling feature and the build are very good. However, i feel ear pain after 2 hours of wearing every trip. I am going back to Bose. I owned one before Audio-Technica, which lasted more than 5 years, and always comfortable. It could last even longer had I kept it in a dry-case."
3,Instant price increase!,Note that Amazaon jacked up the price for this item by $65 within a couple of days of a positive NYT review. It had always been $137.
5,Great product,"I use these at work to block out the sound of the loud people sitting around me. I've found that if I want to concentrate and block out voices from the cube farm, these work best with a soundtrack for ocean waves."
5,Work friendly,"I just got these for an early father's day gift. I work at a computer all day and this summer we have a new building expansion going on right outside my window. Not only have these brough sanity back to me from removing the construction noise, but the background office noises are gone as well.These things are very comfortable to wear all day, and I am able to keep my music a lower level than I normally would for my office.I would highly recommend these to anyone."
4,Heat And Dust,"This film should have an Oscar. Breathtaking and carefully crafted one of the best films I have seen. The film very cleverley shows the end of British as well as the end of Old mughal Nawabs in northern India. Though muslims by faith, the Nawabs or the Princes were far away from their faith and beliefs. It was an eye opener for me as well which explains the fact that such a great Mughal Empire just crumbled within a century."
5,excellent timing,"I haven't watched the Dvds yet so I can't comment on the quality of the Dvd. I can comment on the quality of service. My Dvds arrived 2 days after they were ordered. Excellent service, I highly recommend this company."
3,Just Okay.,"The official write-up of this DVD states that it is a moving storybook. I didn't understand that this means that it is not animation (very few characters actually move) - it is more like looking at pages of a book. Although my 3 1/2 year old twin boys enjoy Keats' stories very much, they had a very hard time paying attention to this DVD."
4,Hot Album,"This album is hot...big boi always brings that fire....check out the bubba sparxxx song its hard....good overall cd...cant wait for the bubba sparxxx,killer mike and outkast cds to drop"
5,Brought back many great childhood memories.,The Man from Uncle series has been very enjoyable to watch. It is great to see alot of the really big TV stars before they were really big TV stars.
5,Waited for 40 years for The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on DVD,"This was my favorite tv show back in the 60's. I had reel-to-reel tape of some of the episodes. Then they released some of the episodes on VHS (2 episodes per tape at $20 no less). Now the box set on DVD, Long wait but worth it. My favorite of the 2 actors is David McCallum."
5,Great value.,"This item was as described and came in unique packaging. As remembered from the series. Great value for the money spent. Just love the ""Today's Deals"" and look forward to more series like this one."
5,Very Confortable..,"I love this shoes..It's very confortable for my work, and looks beautiful. I wear this shoes all week."
1,Worst Toaster We've Ever Had,"We got this toaster to match our black appliances - not from rave reviews - and we've regretted it since day one.The bread has never toasted evenly. There is a slot to toast one piece of bread only, but when used, it slightly browns one side of the bread and does nothing to the other.I would not recommend this toaster to anyone!"
2,"Its only a 2 slice, 4 slice toaster","The toaster worked pretty good, at least I thought it did, I normally use one side for 2 slices most of the time. I tried to use all 4 slots and it would just shut off and throw the circuit breaker. I could plug it into a non-GFCI plug and it would work but it had a slight burning smell. Less than 6 months old. Poor quality control."
2,"Toasts unevenly, doesn't have a REAL bagel setting","My bread gets dark on one side and not the other. I tried the bagel setting today and read the manual in disbelief - ""Bagel"" just toasts longer! It doesn't toast one side like you would want for bagels with seeds on the outside. My old toaster had a real bagel setting - I think I'm getting rid of this crappy Cuisinart toaster."
3,A Little Dissappointed,"I bought this book based on the prior reviews and while I basically enjoyed it I was a little dissappointed. There are two ptimary reasons. First. the author kept recycling the same literary style in moving the plot forward while keeping key players identites secret. And second, I was unhappy with the ending which I found pesdestrian after an otherwise good plot to that point."
4,Pleasing,"Although not as good as ""The Brotherhood of the Rose"", Steinberg has picked up where David Morrell has since fallen flat. There is a great sense of character development and some real originality with the novel's plot. What makes Steinberg work for me is that he is not bogged down with the egocentric flux of Tom Clancy's flawless and seemingly immortal characters. I thought I would read Morrell forever, but it looks like Steinberg from now on. Steinberg is in the business, so he knows what he is talking about. He is not someone who spent (or still spending) his whole life playing Dungeons and Dragons, suddenly an ""expert"" on writing thrillers."
1,Poor description,"The description says ""standard batteries"" but does not define what is a standard battery. Also the box that wa shipped was black. Did not work for my application."
1,Don't bother reading this book!,This book is totally illogical and inconsistent. Don't even bother to open it! I've given it 1 star as there was no option to give it 0 stars! Try reading KundaKunda's Samaysara instead!
3,Until something better comes along. . .,"The other reviewers are correct about the errors. The results of Mr. Butler's formulas sometimes don't match the formulas themselves which in turn don't match his results in the spreadsheets. Also, the grammar, particularly the punctuation, leaves much to be desired. This book had either a poor editor or no editor.However, Mr. Butler is the only author to write a book that shows actual real-world VaR calculations. The other books give plenty of theory, but never enough detail to enable you to do your own VaR calculations. So until something similar and better comes along, this book will have to do. And really, the errors in the spreadsheets are not that hard to spot if you just follow the text and if you are aware that the errors are there."
5,*Good Movie For Everyone!*,A good movie the whole family can enjoy.Fantasy and fairy tales brought to life.Alot of different emotions are shown throughout the movie.Children will probably enjoy this one alot.
3,Has some good points,"Ella is an all right movie. Then sight gags seem to fall flat, but the story is sweet. Hathaway is good at playing a fairy book character, but this Cinderella doesnt deliver."
1,Not the book,"The book Ella Enchanted creates a unique and interesting world. It has fairytale elements but twists them into its own style with it's own languages, lands, and creatures.The movie Ella Enchanted takes this wonderfully unique world and Disneyfies it into generic fairyland. They take everything unique and interesting about the book and ruin it. Even the storyline is changed. About the ONLY thing this movie has in common with the book, besides the name, is Ella's curse. It's like someone read the back of the book cover and made a movie from that. Horribly disappointing. I would not recommend this movie."
1,"Cheesy and, well cheesy.","This has almost no redeeming aspects except for the fact that Anne Hathaway is a FABULOUS actress and she makes almost everything at least a teeny bit better. This does the book NO justice whatsoever, and the ""Medieval Teen"" really pushed it over the edge for me. Disney went too over the top trying to make this a cutesy fairy tale and so they ""cutesy""ed it up way too much. And all the good songs they ruined by singing and dancing to them? Not worth it. Girls around 7 [before they read the book and/or are too cynical] might like this movie. But boys of any age, will not."
2,What a farce!,My family was very disappointed in this film. Why do film makers continue to take excellent written work and make it into something totally unrecognizable? I am very curios what Gail Carson Levine thinks of this farce.Read the book before you watch this. We read it first and we are so glad we did.
3,"Average, likeable, but ultimately forgetable.","Take a good movie like Shrek, which parodies all fairy tales, and then parody that. Then you have Ella Enchanted. The plot of the story is very unstructured, and behind it is fake effects, cheesy 70s music, and slapstick humor. The film wasn't entirely likeable but it wasn't a family film disaster. Anne Hathaway comes through brilliantly as usuall, but she did lack a little. Vivaca Fox also lacked usual spunk, and Minnie Driver was awfully bland at times. Another thing was that 3/4 of the characters spoke with British accents, and Ella magically didn't (Hmmm) The fantasy characters were not so rememberable either. The prince's role in the film, wasn't played out entirely bad by what's his name, and I am sure he will be in many more films. The movie will not become a ""Wizard of Oz"" of its time but it doesn't fail. An average film, that will be overlooked and buried in the years to come."
3,Twsited Cinderella,"This movie was a twist on Cinderella. I liked 'Enchanted' better and it was a twist on seeveral fairytales. Anyway, 'Ella Enchanted' is about Ella who gets a gift as a baby of odbedience. She must do whatever she is told. Then her mother ies and her father gets re-married to an mean stepmother who has mean daughters. The step-daughters find out Ella's gift and use her to do bad things. Then an evil king (who wants to stay king, but his nephew is supposed to be king) tells Ella to kill the prince so he'll have the throne forever. But Ella stands strong and then doesn't kill the king and with her strength, breaks the spell. Then she marries the prince. It's a little funny but the outifts are dreadfully immodest and the dancing and kissing are unneccasary. So, I would give this movie around 3-3.5 stars. It's your choice whether to watch it or not."
1,"The book is five star, not the movie","I like my movies as good as my books and this one fell depressingly short. I had really high hopes for this movie but, I was wrong for it. It doesn't matter, though. After accepting that the movie would never be as good as the book, I shook the thoughts of the book from my mind and decided to see the movie again, without bias. Again, I was disappointed. The script just wasn't good. There was nothing that drew me in and made me feel as though I was experiencing it. I say you save yourself some money and buy a copy of the book. Reading will take about two times more time than watching but you'll get twice the enjoyment out of it."
1,If You Love The Book .......,"This is one of the worst adaptions of a book that I've ever seen. The director of this ""acid trip"" movie must have been under the influence of drugs or a mental case. The target audience apparently was 10 to 16 year old girls. The campy choreography and ""Abba"" styled awful pop music, the inane script, the crude humor, the casting (undewear model, Heidi Klum as a horny giant?!?), and a hip-hop fairy godmother, all add up to a disastrous movie experience. Even the art direction and special effects are awful and cheap! This movie totally destroyed the spirit of the book."
1,One of the strangest movies I've ever seen...,"I haven't read the book, but I've heard a lot of good things about it. (I'd still like to read it, so the movie hasn't ruined the concept for me totally, but it's a close thing...)The movie, however, left me staring at the screen with my jaw hanging open through most of it. ""What the heck is this, and why am I watching it?""I give Anne Hathaway points for playing her part well, but I can't imagine why she'd have accepted the role in the first place. The same goes for Prince Charmont. The dancing elves, the backup singer giants, and the Elton John/Kiki Dee number... What were they thinking? Who decided this would be a good movie to make?And oh, Westley, what have you done?!Pass on this one. There are a million better fairy tale movies. Try The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, Ever After (if you can ignore the French Prince having an English accent)... There's no excuse for this one."
1,"Ridiculous disgusting movie, lousy musical score...","I read the book and loved it. I loved Anne Hathaway in PRINCESS DIARIES so I thought we'd like this movie. The entire family hated the totally inappropriate musical score, and where was the wonderful plot and story from the novel?!?!?I have to give this movie a very low score due to the screenplay and very distracting, ridiculous music. Horrible! The actors were quite good, except the girl who played stepsister Hattie was miscast as she appeared too old."
4,The No Headache Visor - I really like it!!,"I bought this visor for driving around in my Ford Mustang because I wasn't able to find a Ford Mustang visor anywhere on the Internet which I have found very frustrating....but this product came to my rescue and I really like it! It's super comfortable, which I have found other types of these clip-on visors to be very restricting after a short amount of time so they are definitely not good for longer trips. So this is definitely perfect! The only concert I have is that it's so lightweight that I'm afraid that the wind might blow it off my head. But, so far, so good! :)"
3,I'M NOT THE SAME GIRL,"You can say that again sistah....you're not,at least not on this album. Stacy lattisaw's 1985 album I'M NOT THE SAME GIRL was such a departure from her earlier albums that it was strange [for lack of a better word]. There are some.......truthfully,i don't know what you would call these tunes, these songs are more suited for little girls with a hairbrush for a microphone singing in the mirror ! It's not that all the songs are so bad that they're not listenable,it just depends on where your heads at. Stacy sings the material she was given very well but again IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOUR HEADS AT.I'm Not The Same Girl"
5,GREAT VOCALS AND FINE MUSIC,THIS COLLECTION OF STACY LATTISAW IS WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED. THIS RECORDING CAN BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL JINGLES OR TV SHOWS PROMOS. STACY'S VOCALS ARE REACHING THERE MATURITY AND SHE PROVES SHE IS A TRUE SONGSTRESS. I RECOMMEND I'M NOT THE SAME GIRL TO ALL WHO LOVE STACY LATTISAW. TO THOSE WHO NEVER HEARD OF STACY LATTISAW PURCHASE A COUPLE OF HER RECORDING AND YOU TO WILL BE HOOKED ON HER GRACEFUL VOCALS.
4,Does the trick,"I struggled with this purchase because I could not figure out what size to get. Nowhere could I find a chart that would guide me to selecting a size 'medium' for a 36C (for example). Everyone is right that these run small. I am a 36C and this medium is quite tight on me. Since it's a sports bra, that's probably a good thing, because no jiggle is happening here! But if I wanted to just wear it as a regular everyday bra, it'd feel too small. It is good quality, as you'd expect from Champion."
5,Great Bra for a great price,I really love this bra. It fits perfectly (I bought a size Small and I'm a 34B) and was a great price. I really haven't found other bras in that price range (~$12) that compare. I do martial arts and it really supports through all the punishment.
2,Too Small,I bought the X-Large as according to the sizing chart (as I am a 38 D) and it was much too small.
4,Very Nice and Comfortable,"Can get a great price when they go on sale and look for the ""Supersaver"" beats the heck out of box store prices. These are quite comfortable and do not ride up. I machine wash mine but I dry them with air only or line dry them to extend the life of the elastic.Fit is true to size.Lori"
3,"Small size, doesn't wick sweat well","This bra runs small, so order a size or two larger than normal. I'm a 34B and wear a size small, but it was much too tight. The bra itself is okay for the price- it's 43% cotton and can get pretty sweaty."
5,Shower gift from Amazon.,Children's books were requested for a recent shower I attended for my niece. All the other books given were for children who enjoy listening rather than learning from the information. I didn't realize this was the type of book I was ordering but I was satisfied to have given a gift that was different from the others. I was happy with the overall transaction.
3,They have printed a zero more,"Good dictionary, well done, but... if I have counted them correctly, I found only scarcely ten thousand words, and not the said 100.000 words ( an average of 40 entries per 346 pages-English section and per 328 pages- Irish section ). However, it can be read like a romance, and sentences in it seem to be very useful, to train memory."
5,yep,"I buy this book and give it to people that I believe will try to make a difference in leadership with their lives. This book is about being successful-""The Bibical Way."""
5,Blends spirituality and business insights,"The Way of the Shepherd: 7 Ancient Secrets to Managing Productive People offers a new perspective on leadership, telling of a cub reporter who lands an interview and gains keys to exceptional leadership from the most respected CEO in America. From how to lead people so they will see their work as a calling and not just a job to energizing a workforce, this blends spirituality and business insights for both kinds of collections."
1,"Full of misinformation, half truths,",I guess it would be too much trouble for MS. Cliff to check her facts to see if they are true or lies. God what a left wing fool!
3,Relive your childhood,"I ordered this dvd because I remembered Mr. Magoo from a LONG time ago. It really took me back to being a kid and watching certain cartoons in the evening with my family. This is definitely a cartoon from the 60s. The plot is decent, but the graphics and animation are what you would expect from that era. Kind of psychedelic in spots. :-) There is some great music in it as well, by Broadway composers, so the tunes are catchy and stay with you.All in all, if you want to go back to the days when you were a tiny little child, this is the dvd for you. A nice addition to the collection of a true Christmas geek."
5,mon enfance,"L'un des plus beaux souvenirs de mon enfance. Mme s'il a été repris à maintes fois, il n'a jamais été égalé. Vive M. Magoo."
2,Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,Not as satisfying as we remembered as children.The dialogue sticks to the original tale. Intermixed are lengthy songs which hamper the flow of the story.
5,Just like old times!!,"This is a classic Christmas story told in a new way ~ from the perspective of a cartoon character playing Scrooge in a play.......very clever for the times. It used to be played on TV during the holidays, but no more. So I figured I should buy it to keep the memories. GREAT show!"
2,audio is crappy,"I have the original DVD and the audio on that DVD is much better...the audio on the new DVD is awful.Two notables:1) the audio transition from the credits to the beginning ""broadway"" scene is bad...again, compar it to the original DVD and you'll see.2) They actually shortetend the opening credits by a couple of seconds...not a big deal but still, why do this?"
2,Loved the movie as a child!,"However, the copies I received (which I was going to give to my brother for a Christmas present) had terrible audio. I had to send them back. What a disappointment!"
5,Wow,Awesome movie but what i'm impressed with is how fast the movie got to me! 2 days! Usually Amazon takes 4 or 5 days which is still pretty fast but 2 days? geeze.
2,Definitely not for beginners!!!!,"It seems that there was some extremely important information missing! She says that you can change the kinds of oils you use, but failed to provide any kind of lye calculation chart which is critical to making safe soap. She also doesn't explain why she uses some of the ingredients she uses. She says to add Borax to water if you don't have soft water, but why does she want you to add it to the milk? Sugar and glycerin. Are they mandatory??? And why the sugar? What does it do? I appreciated the information as far as keeping the milk cool, and the best way to work with it so it doesn't get scorched, but her recipies are too big to use, and she doesn't include either palm or coconut oil which is a basic staple of all soap. Is either oil not recommended for milk based soaps? There are just too many gaps!!!"
3,Great composing by Beethoven,Two significant complaints about this DVD: (1) the pedal performance contains far too much blurring for my taste as well as the use of the pedal to sustain final notes: in fact the photography even shows hands off the keyboard with the sound still emanating. (2) The camera operator seems almost insanely fixated on close-up shots: the one I was most disgusted by was the shot of the right eye and right ear combo. Some of the keyboard shots were such close shots that they contained hardly any information.
5,...,"all i can say is wow. when i first bought this cd and listened through it the first time, i didnt really listen, it was just playing as background music at a party, so i thought all the songs sounded the same. but after really listening to it, ive come to realize this is one of the best cds ive ever heard. on most cds i own, there are a couple tracks that i skip over cuz i dont like them as much as others on the cd. but on this cd, i can listen through all 12 tracks over and over and never get tired of them. ive always been deep into thrice and i thought this cd wasnt gonna live up to identity crisis or illusion of safety, but i think it surpassed it. i guess you could say the band ""matured"" into artist in the ambulance. i cant wait for what theyll bring out next..."
5,"TAITA--energetic, heavy, inspiring","the new thrice cd the artist in the ambulence was one that i expected to be good, but no where near this good. this cd is truely amazing, every song has enormous energey fuled by hard hitting, fast paced beats on drums, and mind bending electirifing guitar riffs, all topped off with mroe of dustin kensrue's amazing lyrics and vocals. this has also inspired me so much as a musician. im in love with this new album, and i speak for not only myself."
3,Impressed,"Average cd, by an above average band. The cd is good, its comes at you with tracks like ""The Artist In The Ambulance,"" ""Stare At The Sun,"" and a few others, but the other tracks seem kinda like filler tracks in between the ones you really want to hear. There guitarist is great and mixes it up on all tracks, hes a pleasure to hear. The drummer is just a little cymbal happy but not bad. The bass seemed to be mixed in very well with the guitars and drums, it surprised me for an emo band. The vocalist is decent, hes got a rough voice but it works with the guitars and drums. The low parts on the cd were the ""hardcore"" screaming songs, they just did not fit the bill for me.Overall its an average cd with a few above average songs. If i could give it 3 and a half stars i would."
2,remains the same,"I really like the hard rock and the voice, but it just sounds like one whole song...they all sound the same, this is just like disturbed. I enjoy the lyrics but the screaming and monotonous sound of the guitar is a joke."
5,best yet,"identity crisis and the illusion of safety were two great cds. but once again thrice stepped it up with the artist in the ambulance. definately the best cd yet. silhouette, the artist in the ambulance, and hoods on peregrine stand out as the best songs on the cd but there isnt one bad song. Most of this is different from their older stuff but it is still thrice. buy this cd and u wont be dissapointed."
2,Great idea!!...but no savings!!!!,"Ever since I bought a DVD player, this has been the day I have been waiting for!!! The day when Star Trek comes out with a collection set of all their DVD's.As I feared, the colleciton comes with all the what I call ""naked"" DVD's in it.What a waste!!! Paramount had the perfect opportunity to hit us with a collection of DVD's that were packed with extra features from all the films!!! You will not convince me otherwise that Paramount is doing this just to make money and turn around and sell the better version of these DVD's later!!! If that is the case Paramount, then shame on you!!!!You have enough money, so give the people what they deserve!!!!! A collection with deleted scenes, commmentary, still photos(there are millions of those!!!).This is basically pathetic!! Don't waste your money so Paramount will come out with a product worthy of Star Trek fans!!!"
1,A Useless Book,The activities introduced in this book are common sense only. Don't waste money to buy this book.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this book used thinking I could get some ideas for new games to play with my daughter. It's pretty lame and contains plain common sense stuff, even for me who had no prior experience with babies before I had my own. Pass on this book."
3,OK box. Locks are to oeasily picked.,"It is what it is, but know that the locks are very easily picked by my 12 year old."
2,Very chemical apple smell.,"This scent is the equivalent of ""grape"" flavored anything. When you smell it you know its supposed to be apple, but has a strong chemical smell that ruins it."
1,WHAT IS THE CRAP?,"MAN...THIS WHOLE CD IS WACK I WOULDNT WASTE MONEY ON THIS EVEN TO BUY IT FA MY LIL SISTA YA DIG.. HES IN THE GAME WITH NO KNOWLEDGE.. HE NEEDS A EDUCATION AND STOP TRYING TO BE SO TOUGH, THIS DUDE IS STUCK ON HISSELF HOW LAME YA THINK"
4,bow wow: unleashed to the top!!!!!!,"i think that his new cd is awesome. i just got it, and already, im listening to it a lot. i also went on to screensavers.com, and downloaded his screensaver, and it is total awesome. i love it!!!"
3,Whispering Winds of Change,"Wilde's stuff is pretty good, pretty inspiring and very imformative about the nature of human being. You simply have to know where to pick out the pearls and toss the stones.Also, when I read Wilde's short biography about himself and I read his tongue in cheek style, I cant help but to think that alot of what he says may be bogus, and that the man is laughing all the way to the bank. However, he does inspire me to start my own ""new age/self help"" system, with all sorts of little books with scribblings off the top of my head and perhaps sell pictures of my feet so that the buyer can have something to meditate on whilst reading my books. Wilde is a clever man, I admire him for that."
4,this is an expanded edition with 25 mins of more music,"Newly remastered with 4 unreleased bonus tracks.This space rock/psychedelic jazz classic now has 25 minutesof new music (for a total of 80 mins), plus photos and detailedliner notes inside of a deluxe 8 panel digi-pack.Mushroom blends the 1970's vibe of Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock,Soft Machine, and Traffic into a heady instrumental brew that appeals to fans of Tortoise, Air, Can, and Medeski, Martin & Wood."
5,Awesome product!!!!,"The landwave is a great item easy to set up, plenty of jump options, durable and fun, ive ridden a 110 motorcycle on mine and its holding up great!!"
3,Good but kids must be educated.,"I bought one set for my sons age 5 & 3.5 years old. They love to play with their scooters and cycling. They fell a lot so I ensure they wear helmet but they refuse to wear knee guards and others so their knees are full of bruises. I bought another set because the ramp was slightly narrow therefore they fell from the side. It is very costly to buy two sets but they love them. My husband said that he couldn't believe I bought them, I regretted."
4,SoulWork that works,"This is a wonderful book. I purchased this book as part of a course in rehabilitation counseling. It is a wonderful text for those in the counseling field who are looking to use a spiritual approach. It offers wonderful exercises which you and your client may be able to do. The author takes the reader through 7 phases which are: Change, Balance, energy, community, calling, harmony, and unity. After a wonderful explanation and guide though the phases the author is able to pull it all together in the unity phase to show you how to integrate all these parts to make a harmonious whole. It is a great text for those seeking a different approach to understanding calling, and finding the work one loves.I truly recommend this book."
4,First Draft?,"FIRE is a great organization, but I'd recommend ""FIRE's Guide to Free Speech on Campus"" before this book. Some of the chapters read like first drafts, and the book is thin on case law support. I was hoping for more of a ""here's how we'll fix it"" book. It's a valuable book for giving students a head's-up on the kind of issues that may lie ahead in their college experience."
3,"Townships and Ranges gone, also elevation","Hi All I am a disabled traveler and Started out in Missouri and ended up in Arizona.I have used many of deLormes Atlas and Gazetteer's, I dont know why this Missouri Atlas does not have the RANGE AND TOWNSHIP MARKINGS ALSO THE ELEVATIONS???? Maybe it cost too much these days to include that. I have a 1999 Arizona Atlas by DeLorme that has all that included I was Disapointed with this book, print is smaller and does not show any of the city streets???\ does an OK job for the county roads, that does help..But GPS tic marks could be bigger or bolder.overall it might get you where you want to go.I guess so I am not lost in the woods or on some old county road..lolGood luck to all and to DeLorme include these things next time around..ok?"
4,Very Useful,"This atlas is surprisingly accurate. We purchased it in preparation for our move to Missouri. Since then, we have depended on it dozens of times when the state highway maps just weren't detailed enough. There are hundreds of winding dirt roads and trails in rural Missouri, and this atlas identifies almost all of them. I also appreciate the index of campgrounds, state parks, and fishing locations. The only criticism I can muster is the odd proportion of some of the town place names. There are some tiny towns with huge fonts printed on more than a few of the pages."
1,Too old to be useful,"I am very upset. What good is a 10 year old map? Of course I assumed it would be the most recent edition, but I was wrong. I can't imagine anyone would but this if they realized it was so old."
3,Not as pictured,"This blanket is cute, but the border isn't green and white checked; it's all white. Not as cute as I expected."
5,Excess is success!,"It's big and bold and lights up! There's no success like excess, right? Then this is the thing for you! It sets up easily, and is big and tall. I put it out on the front lawn, and it really surprised my wife when she came home. The whole neighborhood knew it was her birthday, and the guests easily knew which was our house. It's held up through heavy rain, wind, and will continue to be used every year. Well worth getting!"
5,GoGo Pen,Overall I am mostly satisfied with this product. I purchased this product to contain my Lionhead Bunny...Only problem is he is very determined and is able to jump out. Never thought he would be able to jump that high from a complete standstill..however he certainly fooled me. Since then I have had to put screening over the top to keep him contained. I do like that the product is portable enuff to use indoor or out. Very well constructed and able to place into any type shape you want. If you purchase this product for a bunny keep in mind they may be able to clear the height.. At least my 3 pounder did!
5,Ronu Majumdar is amazing.,This is real find for High Res SACD audio. I wish it was surround also but I have very much enjoyed listening to the East meets West music created by these excellent musicians from very different genres.
3,Japanese animators draw women very well!!!,"But the plots of these things are hard to follow! The guys are perpetually horny, understandable when you've got these hot animated babes everywhere! But the appeal of these videos is otherwise lost on me. Enjoy the scantily-clad women, and that's about it."
5,Good Night Gorilla,"My 2 1/2 yr old son and 3 1/2 yr. old daughter love this dvd. My daughter loves the gorilla and although the hyenna tends to look like a bear, this dvd does the book well and gets its giggles. The other stories are winners too, my son loves How Dinosaurs say Good Night. I recommend this one and if you dont have Where the Wild Things Are, I recommend that one as well."
4,A Mellow Video,"Since others have ably described what is on the video, I will not repeat, but only add my voice to those that describe Good Night, Gorilla as a mellow, easy-listening sort of children's video.My only complaint, again like some other reviewers, is that the story of ""The Hat"" is strangely discordant and out of line with the rest of the stories. Instead of being soft spoken with mellow music, it is loud and 'violent' with fires, shooting, and talk about cannons. Not something I would have my little ones' introduced to, especially not before bed.That said, I wouldn't let this one story keep you from buying this wonderful video."
5,Fantastic!!,"I loved this story when my ten year old was a baby. Now, my one year old loves to watch this video before bed every night while I tell the story to him. It winds him down just enough to get him ready for bedtime. Great nightime tradition!!"
5,Lord of the rings,Easy to use and has received great reviews and calls for encores from the only audience who counts. What more can I say?
4,"Gossip About Presidents, Who'dathunk?","Gail Collins' Scorpion Tongues is, according to its subtitle, the irrestible history of gossip in American politics, and that is exactly what it is. It will be just right for the reader who will want to settle down and take pleasure in all the mud slinging of the past and for a chance to realize that neither times nor people change all that much. The book does try to give a spin to the stories in order to justify the book on more enlightened grounds of trying to show historical patterns and different eras and forms of gossip. But that is not why people are reading this book and that is not why the readers will be passing this book to their friends. It's the gossip, stupid. A scandal filled romp through American history."
5,Keeps you thinking,"It's a deceptive book -- as easy as it is to read, the ideas and concepts stay with you for a long time. It's not preachy or insistant that there is only one answer to the universe, but rather just uses the topic of reincarnation to open up your thinking to the meaning of life on earth ... and life after earth."
1,what no color?,I cannot believe anyone can write a meaningful book on Barragan without color photographs. The author misses the point and provides us with alot of irrelevant information!
3,A better deal,"Starscream is cool. he is my favorite transformer. but this toy ain't so good. This guy is way too big, and very clumsy. he looks cooler in pictures, ut in real life its not that fun, the best part is the crown he comes with, and the blades. I found a twiin pack that contained both vector prime and a smaller starscream, i bought it for my little brother. the smaller starscream is much cooler and easier to transform, and he is much more fun to play with in my opinion. get the twin pack and save the money for just one."
4,Good book for behavioral analysts to read,"The book is a must have for behavior analysts. It gives a lot of examples of situations and breaks down each guideline. There were a few grammatical errors, but those can be over looked. If you are going into the field of behavior analysis I suggest you read this book and always use it as a reference."
5,fantastic,"My father-in-law has this video. We watched it one time at his house. I remember growing up listening to the Mighty Clouds of Joy, and saw them live in concert one time. This video, I would have to say is the hightlight of their career. The songs moved my spirit and uplifted me. To see them actually sing the melodias tones of the gospel, made me think of all that God has done for me. You have got to get this video, so that you can experience the same joy that I did.TMJ"
1,More than frustrating,"This is the second of these machines that I've had; the first one had to be replaced because it became essentially inoperable after 3 weeks. The new one lasted 1 month before it began misbehaving: it won't record unless it's left on, the controller doesn't work as it should. Yes, when it works, the quality of the recording is good, and that's all I do with it. Nothing fancy or demanding. And yes, as a technical writer I would say that the manual is in need of an overhaul. I will give it one more try, going back to the default values and going through the setup procedure once more. If it fails again, it goes back for a refund. Panasonic should do better by its customers."
1,flakey dvd recorder,"Bought panasonic dmr-eh50 about 2 months ago. First 3 weeks it recorded programs I selected and at least the recorder worked. But then for apparently no reason, it stopped recording scheduled programs. It continued recording programs I manually selected but no automatic recording for scheduled programs I selected. Also,it has a serious reset problem. Sometimes every minute, sometimes every 2-3 minutes, it gets a blue screen for 2-4 seconds and then brings the program back. The TV guide feature was a big disappointment and is not fully featured. The entire thing needs redesign because sometimes I cannot navigate between scheduled programs and TV guide-- just a flakey, not ready for prime time product. Have had good luck in past with panasonic products but after this, I won't buy panasonic brand."
1,independent seller on Amazon.com,"This seller, screaminindig@optonline.net is not, I repeat, not a trustworthy person for anyone to buy from. For your own safety, avoid him like the plague. He sent me product that he knew was not what I had ordered. And it appears to me that this was done on purpose, specifically to make extra money because he knew that Amazon.com is too big and too busy to notice. So, buyers looking at this website,are forewarned, this seller, screaminindig@optonline.net will not honor your original order if he feels that he can make any profit from sending you whatever he, unilaterally, decides to send you."
5,THE BEST CARTOON EVER!!!!!,"Ok ok, I'll admit that I love this show. I never admited it at first in front of my brother or he would rub it in my face.I like the characters and the way that they have attitude! It's actually just the whole cartoon that is awesome. It's funny and it takes awhile, but you can actually get into the plot (unlike some where it takes like FOREVER). It's just totally and completly AWESOME!!!!!!!! Watch it!!!!"
5,Great Show ! Cool Story ! Hyperfast Action! Insane Comedy!,Oh yeah! I've been waiting for this show to come to DVD and it is here! Oh yeah!I like Samurai Jack & also watching Shaw Brothers martial arts movies...this is a perfect blend of both!Get it!
5,where's the next season?,"you would be surprised how funny and entertaining this series really is, even though it looks a bit weak by it's cover. the humor is smart, jack spicer, boy genius is hilarious, and omi is so out of it- where is the next season?? I WANT IT!!! Please?"
4,Alexmack-verygood,I gave this book 4 stars because it's not as good as the other 2 series i am collecting. But it's also science-fiction. How would you like to have superpowers??? I loved this book
3,Need Instructions,"This product came with NO instructions. I figured out how to set the time and how to zero the step counter, but I need to know how to calibrate it and battery replacement info. Does anyone have this information? Can't find an online reference to the company, Fitness Essentials in North Logan, UT."
5,reminds me of my childhood,"I grew up in Southwestern PA, just over the WVa line. We listened to bluegrass and country & western on the radio all the time (I was born in the '60s, I'm not that old!). This album is a gem that reminds me of those radio songs - it reminds me of family gatherings, my grandparents and great aunts & uncles, weekends in the kitchen cooking. I got it free as a gift from a store I worked at, I had no idea it could command this much for a price! I think the store we sold it in, it was under $20. I would never part with it unless I was on my deathbed. If you grew up in Appalachia, especially before the 1980s, this album should make you feel like you are back home, back in time. This is American history."
1,Franken's the joke,"What do you do when you have absolutely no hope of winning an argument intellectually? You make a joke. This man has no intellect, no concept of truth and he isn't even funny. What is funny are the pathetic ratings his little radio show gets. Don't waste your money on this pathetic little(and I do mean dwarf-like), washed up ex-Saturday Night Liver."
1,Where were the jokes?,"I read the book, and I didn't find any jokes. Didn't find any truth either.Hey, in the Amazon video, did that guy REALLY order 5 copies of the book?Or was he ""not telling the truth""?"
2,Pedantic blather,"Al Franken's tone throughout was pedantic and boring. I couldn't stand the re-hash of old issues and his take on them. I quit reading after 100 pages, which I NEVER do."
5,"""The Truth"" Hurts","Nobody does it better than Al Franken. Funny and insightful. Wicked and incisive. Don't be fooled by imitations, there's only one Al Franken. Now, having been fair and balanced with my praise so far, I must say this book is truly better than ""Lies"". Although I can't help but wonder, is it the book that is better or the times. Reading ""Lies"" under the cloud of cynicism and in the eye of the election 2004 hurricane, made it cathartic. And in many ways ""The Truth"" is perfect now because we can laugh easier in the face of the crumbling republican."
4,Gotta wait for the paperback,"My one problem is that if he'd just waited, he could have been able to add in tons of stuff about the Katrina mess. As is, I'll probably wait for the paperback edition with all the new stuff. Still, Franken's always a fun read."
3,"Not quite ""Lies..."", but","still very good. This time, Al takes on the policies of the Bush Administration and the GOP over the past few years, while being both entertaining and giving the reader a sense of outrage. The book begins with an ""anonymous"" Forward called ""Al Franken, American Hero"" that is very funny.In this book, Franken goes after the 2004 election, Social Security privatization, Terry Schiavo, the Iraq War, and torture practices. Though his views are generally well-researched and well-defended, he had the following statement about recent torture practices (p.277):""... 108 detainees have died in our custody during the almost four years we've been in Iraq and Afghanistan. One hundred and fourteen American POWs died in North Vietnamese captivity during the eleven years of the Vietnam War.""This kind of false analogy is unnecessary and weakens his credibility. (The current official MIA count in Vietnam is 1426.) With statements like these, the reader's confidence in his arguments is shaken."
4,The truth strikes again,"I have been a long time fan of Al's ( begining on comedy central when he did that bit with Arianna Huffington, you know before she saw the light and joined the ranks of liberalism.) The facts are there in his book for all to read but sadly the fanatical right wing will not admit to anything being the truth, but it IS there. He consistantly shows how the Bush Crime Family has manipulated and divided us and we as supposedly thinking beings have let us be manipulated. Remember that Bush was going to bring back honor and decency to the presidency and we have leaks of top secret information that could cost us lives and lies to get us into war, these among other things Al addresses in this book. Thank You Al for again giving us the unvarnished truth with verifiable ways to prove them, and if there are those that only want to believe what Bush tells em well that's just sad."
5,"So what do I think about--oh, wait. This is supposed to be the title.","So what do I think about Franklin's ""hardcore"" approach to writing? I don't like it...I love it! I debroached his other book and when word hit my ears that a new book of his was coming out I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! And when I got my hands on it I couldn't wait to debroach it! When I picked this one up I swore on my wife's soul I would be tuned into it for weeks to come. However, one day my wife came home and in all the comotion the book was destroyed!!! And three of my cats were sent to the hospital where they await the care of a Dr. M. Brody! I will have to pick up another copy to read aloud to my catz in the hospital where they reside in stable but traumatized condition, and you should too; I guarantee it!Pete G. Williams lives in Michigan with his wife Marissa and forty-some-odd cats."
1,Dreadful nonsense!,"If Al Franken is humorous, America has lost its funny bone. Only about a fifth of the content is on target. Where does the rest go wrong? It's hard to say. Like similar-styled writers on the right, Franken has a self-righteousness and a smirk that leaves the reader with the mental equivalent of acid stomach. At the same time, one just gets the feeling that Franken relies too much on the desperation of his audience for something humorous. Americans more than ever need a good laugh, but Franken just doesn't have the wit to pull it off."
5,"God (but not ""Gawd"") is on his side","The are four categories of folks who will not appreciate this book. They are: billionaires, bigots, sinners, and suckers. Of course, there's a chunk of folks who fit under three of the four categories. For these people, well, you can probably empathize with jurors from the O.J. trial. It's only afterwards you find out what so many thinking people knew all along. But sooner or later, it will all come down to entitlements. Should the government continue to pay for our nursing homes, or should they just tell us to sleep outside when it's snowing? It'll save money, and it's well, American. Well, George Bush knows the answer to that one. After all, he speaks with Rush Limbaugh. And Rush speaks with Pat Robertson. And God speaks to Pat. Ooops, I mean Gawd."
3,"Good, but not Franken's best","Al Franken's latest, The Truth, With Jokes is not his best. I enjoyed his earlier contributions (Lies and the Lying Liars..., Rush Limbaugh is a ...) more for both their content and their humor. That's not to say that this is by any means not a good read, it is. I guess that maybe I'm just tired of hearing the stories I've been hearing for the past six years again and again.Basically, Franken picks up with the 2004 Presidential Election and takes us through the reasons he believes that it turned out the way it did, namely dirty politics. (I've got my own thought on why Bush won!) Anyway, most of the scandals that have plagued this administration are here, from Jack Abramoff and Tom Delay to Plamegate to the debacle in Iraq. It's a good, informative read for those not in the know, and it does have its' humorous moments."
5,Funny but interesting details,"Frankens book is entertaining but very relevant. Having read a number of books relating to the Bush Administration, from both sides, interestly enough none of them go into the facutal detail to support the positions as much as Franken does. Everyone picks and choses information to suit their own bias but Franken at least uses specifics and blows the cover of the Rove gangs distoritions.Well worth reading.Rod Hagenbuch"
5,"""The Truth""...Funniest Book Since ""Lies""!","In THE TRUTH, acclaimed satirist Al Franken takes careful aim at the Bush Administration, and scores hilarious direct hits each and every time. Our Great Leader is a pretty easy target, of course, as Bush has proven to be every bit as incompetent in his second term as he was in his first. But Dubya is not the only victim of Franken's scathing wit. Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, and Tom Delay are also roundly slapped about their thick, pointy heads, as are gruesome conservative Bush-apologists like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh. Armed with hundreds of well-researched and fully documented facts, Franken shows the world, once again, why the current Republican Party cannot, and should not, be trusted by anybody."
5,Another great one from Mr Franken.,Another great read from Mr. Franken. It helps you get a laugh while the country is spinning clockwise in the bowl.
1,Al Franken disguises propaganda as comedy without the comedy,"Al Franken is what McCarthy was warning America about in the 50s. He attempts, desperately, throughout his book to convince the reader that his words are full of honest to God truth while doing so in an untruthful, untasteful and really hateful way.Al Franken might have HAD a sense of humor but he lost it years ago when he became an angry liberal and this book only proves that fact."
1,Not Funny,"The funniest thing about this book is the cover photo of Al Franken, who by the looks of it, shortened his last name from Frankenstein. It's too bad they had to kill innocent trees for this.Oh no, a bad review. Is Al going to kick me and hit me with a chair?"
1,Poorly done Al,I didn't like Lies and this book is even worse. Extremely biased and not even slightly amusing. It appears as though Al is losing what little comedic talent he had and has now become veryBORING!
5,I loved the book and the FAKE violence againt the GOP dullard. funny stuff,"I do love how Al points out how the mindless right believes everything the GOP tells them, no matter what it is. The short bus riding right still thinks that Saddam has WMD and was an central figure in the 9/11 attacks. If Bush said ""the sun rises in the west"" these jelloheads would cry it loud and proud for years without ever going outside and looking UP!!! Just look at some of the reviews here, these people are obviously still living in their step moms trailer, working at McDonalds, and promising daily to get back to rehab. If you want to laugh at the worst Presidential Administration EVER, while learning a few things about how they got that moniker, read this book."
1,Way to go on the video!,"Bravo Al and Bravo Amazon. It is high time we rid the world of those we disagree with. I am proud that Amazon has shown their true colors by indicating their support for the elimination of America's number one enemy, conservatives, by kicking the S*** out of them for stating their beliefs. With the help of the likes of Al and Amazon, we can totally eliminate them all! Then we won't have to listen to them and that pesky free speech stuff! </sarcasm>Hey Amazon, take this a step further! Why not release the names and addresses of any customer you may have left after this stunt who would dare to even browse books by non-liberals to the likes of Brown-Shirt Al so he can send goons to their homes to reeducate them! That is the only way his type can win."
1,Al Franken's Mein Kempf,"[...] Smashing bottles over the heads of those that disagree with you sounds a lot like Nazi Germany. I've also listen to your rants calling for the execution of Bush and Cheney. Bashing people over the heads is almost as funny as how you swindled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NYC boys and girls clubs for your failed hate vehicle called Air America. Keep those laughs coming Al, what do you do for an encore steal from Unicef???"
2,"Been there, done that",I enjoy bashing Bush and the radical-Rights as much as anyone but this is pretty lame stuff. Maybe is just because I've heard it all before. This is to social commentary what the Three Stooges are to drama: cheap-shots for easy laughs. It gets old quickly.
5,"Brilliant, poignant and heart felt",Franken is a master. His painstaking research should be a mantra for aspiring politicians as well as the general population. Bush and his band of idiots at the very least should be imprisoned and more appropriately should be slowly executed for nearly destroying our nation as well as being complicit in the deaths of thousands of our sons and daughters as well as hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Franken paints a clear picture of the moral bankruptcy of the Republican machine with indisputable evidence and the author's mastery of semantics. It helps to keep the fire burning in our bellies to remind us to never let what happened between 2000 and 2008 rear its putrid head again!
4,"It's good, but not Lies good","Just to get started, this should have been titled ""Lies 2"" because it will take a while to notice any differences between the two. On that note, this is not necessarily a bad thing. ""Lies"" was one of the greatest comedic books ever written. This book, although, doesn't quite pick up slack from where ""Lies"" left off. Involving a little too much drawn-out story telling, there is a larger gap between the laughs, but never-the-less, they are there. If you want comedy, get ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"" but if you want politics, this is probably your better bet. Franken surrenders some laughs in exchange for a slightly, and I do mean SLIGHTLY, more serious tone.Overall, it would have seemed a truck-load better if it came before ""Lies."" After reading the masterpeice that ""Lies"" was, this feels almost like the afterthought. Great, nonetheless."
1,The end of a good thing,Levi's has finally taken the plunge. This last go round of jeans isn't anywhere near the quality/thickness of anything I have ever purchased from them in the past
2,"Made in Lesotto, bad size","In the past a get the same made in Mexico and was better than this made in Lesotto.Size is not similar.I would appreciate it if I could choose where clothing was manufactured. Thus I could buy 100% sure that the size is correct, given the experience of buying before but with a different country of origin."
2,price is high,"price is high, some lee jeans out there are pretty same,i mean the style,material,brand,but with lower price,if the price drop under 25$ that will be better"
3,Quality has taken a dive,"As a creature of habit, I've worn Levis for over 45 years. Beginning in grade school, when you weren't cool if you didn't wear Levis ( and Converse), up to today, when comfort becomes more of a factor, it's just always been Levis when I needed a durable pair of jeans. I'm sad to report that over the last couple of years,the Levis 550 jeans that I've purchased religiously have had a sharp drop in quality. Even though I'm less punishing to my jeans than I was when I was younger, the area around the back pocket rivets shows signs of wear after a way too short period of time. Once the area around the rivet begins to unravel, the pants begin their way-too-early transition from good looking jeans to "" wear me only when doing yard or cleanup work"" jeans. I kept buying the 550's thinking that it was probably a short term aberration. It was not. Sad to say I will start looking around for a new brand of jeans once this latest pair begins it's too quick transformation to ""crap"" jeans."
4,levi's 550 relaxed fit jeans black,Jeans were best deal through Amazon as long as you know your size. Item shipped free and arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend buying through Ammazon as long as you know what you want to save money. They consistently have low prices and great service with free shipping offered most of the time.
5,Levi's are always wonderful!,Especially at the terrific price and free 2 day shipping! Great buy on a great product!
1,The size has changed,"I am wearing these jeans for many years.I ordered 2 pairs of Levis 550 relaxed,But the size became smaller, more like a regular fit.I can't wear them, they are too tight"
2,one size,"my favorite jeans were this size and type, but what came in the mail was not the same product."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY JEANS,AFTER ONLY WEARING THEM for 3 DAYS BELT LOOP BROKE AND ZIPPER TORE UP ON BRAND NEW JEANS..VERY POOR
4,Waist Mesure of Levi's 550,"I have always used Levi's 550 and 560, and I will keep on using them. But in the last puchase I bought one pair of each, and the 550 was clearly smaller on the waist, it is not 36 - al teast 2 or 3 cm - while the 560 fit perfectly as usual.What can I do?"
3,For my brother,Got these for my brother who lives in England -- will be getting another a pair for him has they are much cheaper here in the states.The only thing cannot get 28 inside leg have to get 29
1,BROKEN ZIPPERS,"My husband has worn this style of jeans for decades, zero quality problems...until we purchased from Amazon. On two of the four pair we purchase from Amazon the zipper has broken in less than three months. Since the zipper did not break in the first thirty days we were unable to get a refund from Amazon. Extremely disappointed. Lesson learned we will not buy clothes from Amazon. Most clothing stores will replace or refund defective merchandise."
5,excellent fit every time,these jeans fit the same every time I purchase them. they are the only jeans I like to buy!
4,great look and comfort,"i have a pair of 550 before, bought from TJmaxx. This new pair is thinner, I mean the cloth. the whole thing is lighter compared with the my old pair."
4,love Levi's,"So its been awhile for me to where Levi's. Saw these on amazon and thought I could treat myself. Glad I did, they arrived much quicker than expected and WOW! did they feel good."
2,Not as good as they used to be...,"I've had this pants for only a few weeks, but already they are falling apart. It used to be that Levi's were well made, but every pair I've gotten over last few years has been just poorly made. This will be my last purchase of any Levi's pants, until they change the way they are made."
2,Not as good as they use to be.,Bought two pair same size. One was over one inch longer than the other pair. Wish they were made in USA too.
5,Classic jeans,"These are classic men's jeans, not too tight, not too loose. 36X36 can be difficult to find, especially in our small town, so not only will I buy them again, but this was a repeat purchase."
2,Belt loop broke after 1 month,"I have never had a belt loop break on a pair of Levi's unless I was hanging something heavy from the loop that I shouldn't have. I had a new pair of 550's for a month, and a rear belt loop pulled through the jean material and left a hole where it had been attached. Is there a quality issue? I am returning for a replacement."
3,Levi's Jeans,"Levi's seems to frequently have their jeans made in different parts of the world. These were made in Bangladesh. They are okay, but not quite as ""relaxed"" as those that were made in Egypt that I have previously purchased. These seem to be a little more snug in the crotch and thighs."
3,"Great product, poor service","The jeans themselves were great but I would never buy from this seller, G&L Clothing, again. I ordered the jeans in late December and the second pair just shipped and hasn't arrived yet. In the meantime the jeans I ordered directly through Amazon two weeks ago have already come. I received no word from G&L besides an automated notice when they shipped. Levi's makes great jeans just buy from somebody else."
1,eapoe,the levis which i purchased where of poor quality noticed other people complained what could go wrong with a pair of levis i have purchased a lot of levis in my days the amazon stonewash jeans look like someone took a paint brush and wipe the front with bleach (both pairs) almost to embrassed to wear them the material was very thin compared with much older stonewash levis i have purchased at sears the sears levis have much thicker material even being much older the amazon levis have the printed levi logo on the outside of the pocket inside of the jeans never have seen this before i do not know if a foreign country manufactured them if so someone needs to check quality assurance i will be going back to sears to get my levis at least i know what i will be getting even if they cost little more
2,Not a true fit,"I purchased the black jeans along with two other pair (of different colors). You would think that they would all fit (about) the same. The black jeans were cut completely differently than the other jeans even though they were all supposedly ""550""'s. WIth the hassle of having to ship them back, we just kept them. For us, paying more on Amazon (than our local store) and then having to ship to return wasn't ideal. I think that this experience has made us rethink buying clothes online - convenient to order but, if not perfect, then you have to ship them back. As long as you know this and accept it then it is okay."
4,...But It Could Be Anytime,"None of Ike Quebec's 1961-62 Blue Note albums should be missed, and this lush offering - second of the five - is a fine case in point. The venerable tenor saxophonist blows half a dozen moody and memorable statements on IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING, two of them his own compositions, with consistently fine help from Freddie Roach on mile-wide organ, Milt Hinton on bass and Al Harewood at the drum kit. Ike's patented slow and smooth ambience is well in evidence, and it's a joy to hear it created in such sympathetic company.While the merely curious might prefer to start an exploration of Ike Quebec with BLUE and SENTIMENTAL and/or BOSSA NOVA SOUL SAMBA, anyone who's fallen under the spell of those albums is most heartily advised to seek out this and his other sessions of the era as well. First rate!"
1,JUST BAD,"I BOUGHT TWO PRINTS AS A PRESENT, ONE OF THEM WAS THIS ANSEL ADAMS.BELIEVE ME YOU CAN PRINT IT AT HOME IT'S BETTER. ITS CRAZY BAD, SO UPSETTING.THEY THINK THEY HAVE A BUSINESS DOING FRAUDS SELLING AWFUL PRINTS OF INTERNET SOURCED PHOTOGRAPHS.BE ASHAMEDDDD"
3,so rough and wrinkly!,it became so rough after the 1st wash. (who said soft??) much rougher than my previous 300-thread-count sheets. and it wrinkles like you won't believe.
5,love the sheets!,"The sheets are great, love them! Got them quickly, and I am very pleased with them!"
4,"Excellent Quality, but they don't respond to dryers well","These are great sheets. They are very soft and smooth, great sleeping (I've had mine for some two weeks now). IF you put them in the dryer, they wrinkle badly... they almost demand ironing, but if you can hang them up to dry, they come out smooth and nice. I know many people can't hang clothes up to dry, and that maybe a consideration, but if you can, the sheets respond very nicely."
4,Truly Interesting,"As a first time author, Ms Stewart kept my interest for two days. I had to know what happened with these two sisters. I am looking forward to more works from this author. The cover was also a draw."
3,HELP DID NOT GET MY REFUND !,I accidently clicked twice for this product. Got product in the mail and liked it. But I received another Rest Assured Black Light. Soon after I discovered my mistake and e-mailed The Rest Rssured Company that I was going to mail this item back to them for a refund. That was back in November. I MAILED THIS ITEM BACK AND PAID FOR THE POSTAGE.I have been checking my discover card bill for the last two months and have not seen my refund yet. Please help me with this. The price of this item was $59.95. I need to get this back.
3,"Scramble Some Eggs, 'Cause Here's The Ham","Whoever said two-heads were better than one must have written the script for this movie. An interesting contrast of insanity and timidity as our two-headed star provides some of the best (translation: hammy and humorous) B-movie acting this side of ""Urban Menace."" Vegetarians would be offended being exposed to this much pork.Good thing Casey Kasem had a back-up gig. Boy would I love to see the Farrelly brothers remake this."
3,Jay Jay the Jet Plane figures,"The Brenda Blue, Mrs. Blue, and King figurines are great for acting out the Jay Jay stories. The paint is rippled on one of the figures that we bought.It is possible the seller didn't notice."
4,WORTH READING,"Very interesting read. Betzinez' descriptions are vivid and colorful; especially when describing the areas he roamed with Geronimo. Definitely biased, but interesting just the same. He went from a nomad Apache to a settled blacksmith and farmer. Although Betzinez is Native American, he gives a different view of the Carlisle School, relationships with his white neighbors, and the Army of the late 1800's than the popular Native American view. Filled with many historical highlights of the late 1800's to the early part of the 20th century, and Oklahoma history. Great pictures and maps if you're learning about the west.I strongly recommend this book."
5,Insightful,"The Day Dixie Died isn't just somebody's opinion about what happened after Lincoln was shot. It is a compilation of excerpts from diaries, letters, and newspaper articles written at the time in US History when we as a country were in total dis-unity and turmoil. My mother said it is the saddest book she has ever read. Like reading Andrew Carroll's ""War Letters"" it will touch your heart to hear in their own words the suffering of the people caught in the middle of the aftermath of the Civil War."
3,"Unlike most, I didn't go head over heels for this title....","I have been hearing about this series for years now, so I thought I'd give it a try. And yes, I did like it, but I also haven't had the urge to watch it in over a year. And I am going to sell it here on Amazon sometime soon.See, while the art was pretty, I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. I can't explain it--there just wasn't any magic there. There were all just standing around, trying to decide what to do, rather than taking any form of action. Some of their voices annoyed me as well.All in all, I recommend that everyone watch this at least once. Maybe you'll like it better than I did."
3,Too violent,I love a good drama but this one was way too violent for my personal liking. Overall it was decent though.
1,Relentlessly Boring,"Watching this movie was as excruciatingly painful as the real life characters and story.Two of my friends walked out before seeing the entire dreadful extravaganza. If I want to experiencethe pain and suffering of people in poverty, all I need to do is turn on the Los Angeles nightly newsto see the latest drive-by shooting in Compton, or a dead body found in a dumpster in San Dimas, or the latest group of illegal immigrants arrested and deported, or the latest DEA drug bustPrefer reveling in the extraordinary scenic beauty of Rio, the incredible Brazilian cuisine, the fantastic music,the world-class Carnaval, and the vitality and joy of the special people who live there.I always judge a film by whether or not I will view it again. I'll donate my copy to someone who prefers sufferingover joy and happiness."
4,Thought-propvoking plot. Good acting from non-professional actors = Best movie from Brazil so far,"It has a disturbing and thought-propvoking plot. It shows what life has in store for many kids in one of Rio de Janeiro's ghettos, City of God. They learn to kill, rob, and sell drugs to get rich. Most of them will end up being killed.The acting look real. The surprising thing is most of them are non-professional actors.The film is interesting from the beginning till the end. If you like movie dealing with social issues. This is definitely for you. It's the best movie from Brazil so far."
4,Excellent,"For people who say its too violent, they need to get over it because this movie says a lot of about the economic and racial standing of Rio's favelas at that time. Great film."
4,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: vivid direction; believable acting; intense plot.Lowpoints: a little too Scorsese/Tarantino-likeConclusion: Using first-time actors - real kids with no performing experience - the director's first feature is certainly an enthralling piece of work, vibrant with energy and style. Shot mostly with hand-held camera, 'City of God' is indeed soaked through with realism, its drama accentuated by scenes that startle with brutality (beware of the one involving little kids and a gun, it DOES end the way you are terrified it might). Despite obvious homage to Martin Scorsese (extended camera shots; the plot involving the life of a young suburban kid and his friends trying to survive is told in a similar structure to 'Goodfellas') and Quentin Tarantino (the contrast of wit vs brutality in the sparkling dialogue), we have obvious talents here, ladies and gents. Believe the hype - this one is worth having."
5,Great Movie,"Yes, this movie is violent. We are not talking unrealistically Kill Bill style violence. Rather, this is a movie with a realistic, stylistic, and historically accurate storyline that also happenes to contain many violent sequences. According to professors focused on Brazilian history, whom I have studied under, this movie is a true depiction of the life in some parts of Brazil.However, I understand that some Brazilians are not happy about the representation this seems to give of life in Brazil, or of Brazilians in general. While this is a valid point if this movie is taken in context it does not generalize. The viewer has the responsibilty to understanding the history and dynamics of Brazil before viewing. If they don't, then that is their mistake.Otherwise, those who complain about the violence should probably avoid finding out anything beyond their cozy suburban life. If not, they risk realizing life and the world are not what they thought."
5,Fantastic,"Anyone who liked Slumdog Millionaire should fall head over heels for this one. Perfectly understated humor, good acting, style coming out of its ears, no sappy ending nor truly gratuitous violence (though there is a lot of violence in the favelas and likewise in the film); City of God has everything you want and nothing you don't in a gritty film about life on the streets. Given the fact that Brazil has literally millions of street kids and neighborhoods/shanty towns that street gangs control absolutely, this is also an important film for more reasons that just its massive entertainment value. Sadly, due to some technicality or timing issue it somehow wasn't eligible for the Oscars. That's truly a shame because if Slumdog Millionaire won eight, City of God should have won 18."
4,When things go from good to bad....,"Katie Castle works for Penny Moss and thinks that everything in her life is wonderful. She has the man of her dreams, the job she loves and a good life, but when things change she realizes that she needs to change.Katie at first annoyed me at first, she was a snob who only wanted things for herself and didn't care about anyone or anything. But when she screws up and loses everything she has to realize that she too needs to change.From the high end to the low end Katie makes turn around. She makes new friends and starts up with new ideas.The only downfall of the book was at the end I knew how it would end and was upset with it, but other then that this was a wonderful first book from a great new author."
4,Fashion,"This book made me really mad at the beggining when it dissed fashion designers, i almost stopped reading right there. But it ended up being pretty good."
5,Vital information for women regarding health and menopause.,"Amanda McQuade Crawford offers practical information for women in all stages of menopause. Ms. Crawford's degree in phytotherapy from Britain's School of Herbal Medicine and her membership in the prestigious National Institue of Medical Herbalists, in the UK serves her well as she guides her readers through the complexities of menopause. The blend of herbal wisdom and reputable scientific data contained in Ms. McQuade Crawford's writings will serve all women to find relief and to better cope with their symptoms. Introduce this book to your Gynecological doc!"
3,It's OK,"This ring is a little looser than the ones used at my gym, so the pressure is not as tight, but it's easy to grip and serves the general purpose."
2,BORING!,"I had a tough time getting through this book. I really enjoyed previous Carly Phillips books and just finished the Hot Number, Hot Item, etc.. series before I started this book and I have to say, those were above and beyond better than ""Cross My Heart"".The book was boring and the main characters weren't terribly likeable. Thank goodness Hunter and Molly were good supporting characters or this would be a real dud. Stick with previous CF books - it's ok to miss this one!"
3,"Loaded with insight and really, really long sentences.","Written in a conversational, narrative style. Content seems thoughtful, thorough, and well intended, but the writing style isn't easy to digest. Filled with meandering, convoluted sentences with lengthy parenthetical comments. Lots of stories, insight, and detail on many aspects of the topic. Just not a breeze to take in."
2,I didn't find this book useful,The style of this book was was largely stories about the Author and his friends/aquantances. If there was a point to any of these stories; I was too bored to find it. This is a great book to have around if you run out of Ambien.
3,Definitely not for beginners,"I'm a graphic designer with a little bit of scripting knowledge from director. I've made quite a few simple games in director and was looking to jump into actionscripting because of its web friendliness.I understood everything for the first couple of chapters but from then on I got more and more confused. This book jumps in the deep end and unless you've got a good head for mathematics/programming I'm guessing that most people will find themselves lost.If you're looking for books to help you learn actionscripting from the start. I would recommend buying 'Macromedia Flash MX ActionScripting: Advanced Training from the Source' and 'actionscript for flash mx' together, both of which I found to be excellent."
2,"Great Music, Brutal Sound.....","Let me begin my review with this fact: a Goolge search of the words ""wounded, bird, records, terrible, & sound"" will yield close to 100,000 link results. Having said that, I totally agree with the other reviewers here. I have this album on vinyl and wanted the cd for use in my car. The sound quality is just terrible. It literally sounds like the transfer was from an old 8-track tape. The terrible sound quality is not unique to this release however, many of the Wounded Bird cd releases suffer from the same sonic fate. From Thin Lizzy & Phil Lynott to Lenny White...many reviewers here on Amazon agree. If you do not have the vinyl lp, can deal with subpar sound and can get this cheap on ebay or zShops, do it. This music needs to be heard. Michael Angelo (Batio) can flat out rip on guitar. Too bad an outfit like ""Rhino"" can't step in and give many of these recordings the treatment they deserve."
2,Weak,"I bought this book because it was recommended by a small, independent bookstore I am fond of. While it was a quick read, it was a very weak book. I can describe it best by sharing that when I finished it, I had the same sensation as when I read a magazine cover-to-cover while sitting in a waiting room."
5,Seriously This Movie Is Hilarious,"I keep reading reviews saying this movie sux, but in reality it doesn't. Ok, so we've all heard some of the humor, but for the most part this is just a solid comedy. Its funny seein Eddie Griffin play the most grown up out of the three guys, and when isn't Anthony Andersen funny? The white dude ain't too bad either. Anyways, I don't see why this is getting such bad reviews, Barbersop did all right and i like this movie better.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have some laughs, or is just having a bad day, and needs it brightened up."
2,OK movie to watch with someone,"If you're looking for a date movie or a movie to watch with a significant other, this would be a good choice. I thought from the cast this movie would be hilarious, but it's not. It has a soft pretty much clean cut plot. There wasn't much to the movie, but it was still a decent movie overall. I would definitely suggest it as a rental. If your looking for the familiar antics of Eddie, Method, and Anthony, you might be disappointed."
2,under par,i have the first four works by her with chip taylor and this one just doesn't come close although good in her own way it isn't the sound i'm looking for
1,POSSIBLY THE BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR,"Forget Meshell N'Degeocello or Bruce Springsteen, Aaron Carter's ""Another Earthquake"" is the best album of 2002! This album is funky, soulful, and riveting. Aaron sings with a grit beyond his years. This kid can sing better than Marvin Gaye and Al Green combined. He's a legend in the making! Songs like ""To All The Girls"", ""My First Ride"", ""2 Good 2 B True"", and ""Sugar"" talk about the pueriles of growing up in America today. They are very powerful. I nearly cried listening to ""America AO"", a stinging punk anthem about the state of America today. It's so deep, this is very powerful music.But what do you come to expect from Aaron Carter though? You didn't actually think he'd actually release a rushed set of childlike kiddie pop that has no substance beyond the Disney Channel or fifth graders? Come on, this is Aaron Carter, he'd never do that! Right?"
1,Fake music!,"Aaron Carter's album, Earthquake, is just another example of the crud that is being labeled as ""music"". Aside from the fact that he is only signed because his brother is a Backstreet Boy, and that entire fad wore off a while ago, Aaron is just plain boring and over produced.His songs mainly cater to the un-trained ears of 9 year old girls, who rely more on clothing and looks to hook their fan base, than actual music talent.And I'm getting of hearing songs where Aaron mentions Nick. People who are giving this album 5 stars need to admit to themselves that their obsession is nothing more than a teeny bopper feeling. Yes, Aaron has a few fun and feel-good songs, but this is NOT music.Aaron- do yourself a favor- STAY IN SCHOOL. That way you'll have a life and career after your ""music"" career is finished.... which is any day now."
2,Average,"JS have good Voices for the Background&are fine looking Sisters but for a whole album is a bit much.I think if you trimmed off 5-6 songs this set would have been better.R.Kelly the King of R&B wrote&produced 8 tracks.the title track is catchy but my favorite track on this set is ""Baby,Come On"".JS sound good backing R.Kelly&THe Isley brothers but out front is a bit much.Vocally on a whole they are a notch beneath what R was able to do with Changing Faces&also JS vocally remind me of Brandy.I think they have a Chance with more Up-Tempo Cuts overall.right now I was mainly interested in there Album because of what R.Kelly was bringing to the Table but hopefully they can Improve on this the next time where they match the Talents of the Writer&producer.""Ice Cream"" is a Cool Cut&the Video is nice.ROnald Isley aka Mr.Biggs driving the Ice Cream Truck is Classic."
1,Js = Just Sorry!,"I'm sorry that I had to slam this one because I wanted more than what I got from these pretty sisters. There voices are ok but the songs stink! R Kelly might had written them but they couldn't pack the punch need to make me stand back and take notice.""Love Angel"" and ""Handle Your Business"" were the only good tracks I liked off this whole album. I had to stop playing ""Ice Cream"" because the song was purely annoying. I wish I would had just fast forwarded me walking PAST the section where I saw this album and deciding to buy it.People do yourself a favor and with the money you was going to spend on this album buy yourself two gallons of ice cream. It's a better investment."
4,using armbard at gym,"I use the armband at the gym primarily, both cardio and weights. It loses a star because the headphone wire comes out at a very conspicuous angle, sometimes getting stuck on the machine I'm using at the gym. 99% of the time I don't even notice that I'm wearing it, which is the idea. It is very easy to adjust and put on/take off. Custom designed for iRiver, the casing is excellent."
4,Another good Ann Rule book!,"The Green River Killer killed dozens of prostitutes in the Seattle area in the 80s. He was finally caught when DNA technology advanced and samples were sent in to be analyzed. The book is very creepy. Gary Ridgeway, the killer, was able to go undetected for over a decade because he lived a basic American life: job, family, homeowner. I think another good book angle about this case would be just how the cops overlooked Gary Ridgeway even after eyewitnesses described his truck numerous times, one victim's family led the police directly to his door, he was investigated and given polygraph tests, and was stopped by police for using prostitutes a couple times. This makes the book even more gripping and horrible, as more and more prostitutes go missing (sometimes one a week) even as the police have put the killer on their short list of suspects."
1,Disappointed,"Maybe it's been a while since I've read any of Ann Rule's books, but this one was disappointing. I was interesting in learning more about the Green River killer and did only after skipping through pages. The book goes on an on about the officers involved in the investigation, which I did not find relevant."
5,One of Ann Rule's best....,Having grown up and still living in the Puget Sound I have read all of Ms. Rule's books. This is one of her better efforts. She lives in the area where these murders occurred and that personalizes the account. Lots of detail here. Good job Ann and keep 'em coming! My only regret is that these murderers are allowed to live in prison at taxpayer expense. We need to be rid of them! Promply execute them with no excuses please.
2,too much of an Ann Rule memoir,"Ann Rule is one of the most infuriating writers of any genre. When she puts her mind to it, she can certainly write true crime well, but this book suffers from a heavier dose of E.A.R.S. (Excessive Ann Rule Syndrome) than her other writings, and she always manages to inappropriately abruptly stop the flow of her narrative to put herself into whatever she is writing about.Also, her research at times is faulty, to say the least. I read the paperback version of this book -- which presumably would have given her time to correct errors from the hardback edition -- and she still, in the afterword, places the infamous Scott Peterson on death row ""in Alcatraz"", which has not been used as a prison since the early 1960s. Peterson is, of course, in San Quentin State Prison, but the reader is left to wonder: if Rule got this fact wrong, how many other inaccuracies are in this book?"
4,Book review,Very satisfied customer. Book arrived to the day even though it was just prior to Christmas. Book condition excellent. Great read very interesting content.Would recommend the author to anyone
3,"""Green River Gary""","With Green River Running Red, Ann Rule has done a great service not only for Ridgeway's victims, but also for the society which often regards such persons as throwaways. Replacing their numbers with their names and faces, she describes each of these women with sensitivity and compassion, reminding readers of their humanity and desperation. On the other hand, Rule treats Gary Ridgeway, who was jokingly labeled ""Green River Gary"" by co-workers after police first questioned him, with clinical objectivity. There is nothing new here: a psychologically empty man with no conscience exerts the ultimate form of power over a series of victims who are the symbols rather than the sources of his pain. Why this happens, no one yet knows. But one thing seems certain. If you encounter an individual who appears harmless yet seems a bit creepy, you'd best not get involved."
5,Crime looked at from multiple angles,"Rule brings to life the young prostitutes who won't ever grow up. We learn about each one, from the girls who grew up in poverty to the ones who didn't choose this ""profession"" out of desparation. Most backgrounds include small b&w photos of the girls. We also read about law enforcement's difficulties with apprehending the killer. It's a sad book, made sadder with testimonies of the prostitutes' friends and families. The killer at first remains anonymous, with his pathetic story being woven in and out of other chapters. The guy didn't have a whole lot going for him to begin with, and then ""something"" pushed him to frequent and murder prostitutes. What was his motive? Were there other suspects? Are Green River bodies left unidentified? Were any women other than prostitutes murdered? This book covers everything about the case."
2,Ann Rule phones this book in,"Using the critical acclaim of her other novels Ann Rule writes her latest novel for a 3rd grade reading level. This book was just bad. Taking such an interesting topic and dragging it down with horrible metaphors and sophmoric writing. Does she expect her average reader to have a 3rd grade education? She insults her readers by using big words and then putting the definition in parathesis around it. She constanly repeats herself so much to the point where I thought I had lost my page and was re-reading. Dear Ann Rule you are the worst writer I have ever read. The novel got a bit better towards the end when she speed it up, but please retire for the good of literature. Do you know any other literary technique than similie? I mean dear god I'm a 18 year old high school student and I least know how to use syntax, diction, and irony to my advantage. Don't read this book.. please you will thank me later"
2,True Crime but too interrupted,"The author has done better work. Although the topic is both horrific and fascinating, Ms. Rule keeps interrupting the story of the killer and killed with her own story....quite distracting. When she focuses on the crime, it is vintage Rule and worth it.....but her insertions of her story weaken the effort."
2,A bit biased,"It seems the author has something against Baptists as he states in one chapter that an aquantince was a ""former baptist"" as though that had any relevance to the book at all.The author also states toward the begining of the book that he believes that if one has a contiuing physical problem i.e illness etc.. that does not go away after much prayer and fasting etc.. they are possesed by a demon. If this is true then paul, the writer of much of the new testament, was possesd as he had an eye problem.Finally, I felt the book in parts was more of a platform for advertising strang communications and the books he has published.Another theological misstep was the comment that Christ was going to build His church on peter. Jesus meant He would build the church upon Himself, not a mear man such as peter. Perhaps the author should have spent more time studying his greek and less time worrying about his physicalness."
2,"Great for my daughter, but makes me want to shove chopsticks in my ears","I have to admit, my daughter loves Harry the Bunny, so we watch it. However, EVERY SINGLE EPISODE involves some sort of chomping, slurping, annoying giggling, and of course the awful music. I don't know why she likes it so much, but I genuinely wish I had never put it on for her, because now I have to watch it when she does. I cringe every time he sees a carrot (or anything) to eat, or something to drink, because he has to slurp and smack his lips for a solid 30 seconds each time. It drives me crazy!! The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because of my daughter. Oh, what we will put up with out of love for our children. :/In short, I do not recommend this show to anyone, ever."
2,Useful but filled with errors.,"If you are new to website construction and are considering Adobe GoLive CS Classroom in a book (REVISED EDITION)as a reference guide...beware!How could a revised edition still have so many errors (especially as found in Chapter 9), shame on you Adobe Systems.So much of the web design industry has gone to Dreamweaver, that I wonder if Adobe has lost interest in maintaining an adaquate level of support for this product...and now we hear that Adobe has just purchased Macromedia."
1,Worst Korn song ever,"I have been a korn fan for about 5 years now, and when I first heard this song, i was disgusted by it, it is one of the worst songs i have every heard, it's like they didnt even put any time or effort into it, sounds so engineerd they have surely lost their potential, I'd like to give it 0 stars but they lowest number i can rate it is 1, the song isnt even worth rating, and to all you little kiddies who think this is the best song or the ""heaviest"" song they have done, I suggest you buy their first two albums, when they really didn't care about money, just the music."
1,Caveat Emptor!,"This book contains multitudinous mistakes, and if an unsuspeting test-taker is not careful, he is sure to learn frequent fatal falsehoods. Great examples are (x+y) = x+2xy+y, and (x-y) = x-y (p. 178). Furthermore, 93, 87, 57, and 51 are not prime, as page 33 asserts. Finally, the book asserts that if x = -1, then x^4 -x^3 -x^2 - x - 1 = 2. This is not the case; it equals 1. This books has caused must grief, bewilderment, and confusion. It is fortunate that it was designed for smart test takers, for dumb test-takers will need all their wit to overcome its errors. Unfortunately, no wit will be left for the test."
1,horrible! do not buy this book,This book is terrible. In addition to the many errors it is far too simplistic. I will be returning this book. Arco should be ashamed. I wish I had seen Eric's review before i bought this book.
2,Impossible to insert,"It's almost impossible to insert the earplugs. When I roll them between my fingers, they pop back up to original size the moment I stop pushing. There is just no time to put them into your ears which makes them useless.I see that some reviewers have the same problem (most of the reviews seem to be positive, so maybe the earplugs I received are defective).The other brands and models work fine for me."
5,Please let me have it!,I loved this show. I missed 2 seasons.I want to watch it. I want to buy it. Please let me!
2,Another Stupid Movie,"this movie starts out good but gets dumb fast , one thing is they needed to leave the white people out what were they thinking then they got Asians dressed like white people. there are a few good points in this movie which is why it didnt get a 1 and you should see this movie but not necessarily buy it."
5,"Very good, and fits perfectly","It is sturdy plastic, locks into place the way it is supposed to, and has lasted a few years now."
4,it is what it is,Got it to replace the cheap white plastic covers I got on a couple lens I've bought .. it is what it is. It's too expensive for that so you have to make your own call on that one.
5,Zombies = Good reading for me....,"I love this series, yes it's a typical Romero Zombie story. But that's what makes it so good. The story line in excellently written. Basically if you LOVE zombies and zombie stories. Then pick this up."
5,In Love,"I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead, these comics are perfect and the prices are great. I highly recommend purchasing this comic and every other one in stock."
5,Sucks you in,Enjoyable comic about survival after a zombie apocalypse. The art work is really good. My only complaint is that the words were a little too small to read on the kindle sometimes.
5,An amazing story with what every geek craves - Zombies.,"I must admit that I had never even heard of the comic until after AMC adapted the story into an awesome television series that I pray doesn't get canceled. I've always loved zombie flicks and watched them since I was a kid with my father and seeing how the story is always cut short due to the length of the film, I am really happy to have found this as a source to continue the idea of what happens next. And to know that Kirkman is still writing to this day makes this even more appealing, because if the tv show gets to join the realm of the deceased then we'll still have a pictorial reference to turn to."
5,Sweet,LoveIt's amazing and the art work is beautiful. Also Carl is a bigger badass than I thought he killed Shane without hesitation. I watch the show and its great too!
5,Wow,I've seen the series but have only scratched the surface of the walking dead comic world. I am for sure going to be reading the rest of them.
2,Scratches the zombie itch,"If you've got a jones for some ""survivors in a post-zombie apocalypse world"" then this title will scratch that itch. It's got zombies, human survivors fighting amongst themselves as they come to grips with their new world, and... well, that's it.It jumps right into the action which is nice. However, the action and the characters aren't particularly new or interesting in any way. The dialogue can be brutally on-the-nose at points. I enjoyed it well enough since I was in the mood for people trying to survive an epidemic of zombies and I look forward to the rest of the series. There's just nothing really here to rave about."
3,UGH only on Kindle Fire and Kindle for Android???? Too late I already bought it :(,"I thought I would be able to read this on my iPhone and PC. I can't believe it wont at LEAST work on PC...trying to make us give in and buy a Kindle? Should have bought the Comixology one I guess or ordered the book. This review DOES merit a 3 because of this, you look around carefully there's a dropdown that reveals that it's only on Android & Kindle but it was not up front for me to see that and geez you would ASSUME something this popular would be on all formats."
5,"All Great: Dialogue, Art, Story","Collects issues 1-6. Great dialogue, perfect use of black & white, great art, and a very compelling story, this book has it all. The last pages were powerful and I look forward to volume 2."
4,Not Bad,"I had always wanted to read the Walking Dead series having watched the television series, but never had the time until now. I enjoyed the black and white panels and the story was very easy to get into. The story differs quite a bit here compared to the beginning of the tv series, but I really enjoyed the over the top goryness of the book so far. Rick is very naive and I can only imagine it will change from this point on. The mature rating definitely works for a book like this and look forward to the shenanigans in the future books."
4,The comic review,A bit more fast paced then the show and the show explains more but otherwise its good and amazing comic!!!
3,I've never bought a comic before,The art work is amazing! Also the comic is different to the TV show in many respects. I loved reading the comic but the only thing that stops me buying the next issue...the cost. 5.22 is a bit too pricey for me. Drop the price a bit and I'd probably consider buying more of them. The price is the reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars out of 5.
2,"Not awful, but not great, and not satisfying","I bought this tv a year ago, and it works pretty well as a tv, but I cannot get it to work with my computer, which was one of the selling points. I have tried several cables and all possible menu setting combinations; it just won't work. As a tv, the picture and sound are quite good. The remote is not easy to use, and its battery life is especially short, plus it takes expensive little batteries."
5,Outstanding sound.,This home theater system is great! It was fairly easy to setup with detailed instructions. Once connected the sound is phenomenal and clear. Highly recommended for the price you pay!
4,Fantastic Debut Effort!,"I had the privilege of seeing Carla perform several of her songs live, and she is definitely an artist to watch out for! She spans the gamut from soulful ballads to edgy rock with the grace of a seasoned professional! You will not be sorry in buying this album..."
3,Bought it for Nostalgia,"When I got my first copy of the book as a kid, it was awesome. But the information was fresher then too. Its not a bad book though, a bit dated relative to now being 2010. Some things don't change, others have been improved or other techniques exist that might be better, but the book is still an interesting book if you don't pay a lot for it. In my case, I gave away my original copy and then recently I decided I'd like to have it back to put on my shelf, mostly for the nostalgia value."
4,I admit,"OK I admit, I purchased an extra body cap to make a pinhole lens for my D90, muwahaha... and it works perfectly ;) But why is Nikon plastic so expensive?"
5,no complaints,The product arrived on the date that it was slated to arrive. The product is as specified on amazon. The product was a good price compared to other products. 5 stars for the product doing exactly what it said it would do and arriving on the date it said it would.
5,This Movie Did Not Get the Credit It Deserved!,"I saw this movie back in the 80's and loved it. It's timeless. They could easily remake this movie. If they do, I only hope it's done respectfully."
5,This film is brilliant,Excellent acting - Excellent film - Everything about this excels it is the ultimate spagehetti western! I have watched this so many times & will watch it so many more! It is brilliant
1,*Not a Spaghetti Western*Duck You Sucker Aka A fistful of Dynamite,"...Or Aka A bad movie,Once I saw the Mao Zedong ""Revolution"" Quote(beginning of the movie) it went downhill for me, Where Did Sergio Leone Go Wrong? what happen? Compared to his Masterpiece 3 movies(The Man with No Name Trilogy) with The Good,The Bad and the Ugly being the Zenith and end all of the 3 movies,this movie is not even close to that, and It's the political or social message that's in there that ruins a movie. Sorry If I can give less than 1 star I would, Sergio Leone's Best was The Man with No Name Movies. You can label me a Reactionary because that's exactly what I am and watch elsewhere for a Good western."
4,Nicely Made Tank But Runs Very Small,"I like it that this is a made in the USA product. It is nicely made and is not too long as some trendy tanks are these days. Only one thing, it runs very small. I ordered a size large and it is much smaller than some of my medium tanks by other makers. Next time I order, it would have to be an XL. I usually wear a size medium in Lands End, LL Bean, Eddie Bauer tanks."
4,Episode #4 missing,"This set is missing Episode #4 ""I'll be missing you"". I contacted A & E about it and was told that the cost to include a Sting song was too prohibitive and therefore, they did not include it on the set."
3,Muy buena serie ... pero,"Excelente serie, con todo lo que debe tener el genero, muy buena primer temporada.En cuanto al DVD, deja mucho que desear. No tiene opciones de idiomas, ni subtitulos en español, por lo que la unica opcion es mirarlo en ingles.Lo mas triste es que no salio el pack en otras regiones. Por lo que es imposible ver la serie si no hablas ingles. Una lastima, una gran serie, que no podemos ver."
3,"Great material, awful presentation.","As I become more experienced in boxed DVD sets, tipically 2 problems arise with many of these: irritating visuals and awful sound. This is an all too typical example of both. As all too many show, it is simply unwatchable in dayligh, unless you are in as sealedm dark room. And the sound, specifically dialogue, is all too often unintelligible. At least some DVDs compensate the second with subtitle/closed captiones options. This one does not. I find it frustrating that such good material cannot be presented better. Am I the only complainant here? As it is I will have to watch it only at nights, even in the weekends. And the 3 stars are only because this was a good, suspenseful program."
5,Belongs in Any Library,"This is a great little book. Walters' leadership style and approach closely mirrors my own. While the book is very short and compact, the lessons and principles are vast and timeless. There are quotable passages throughout the writing, and while the approach is simple, it is far from simplistic. Walters breaks up leadership into what it is and what it is not. For example, he notes that leadership is not an ego game, but it is responsibility, self sacrifice, service, loyalty, intuition, flexible, action oriented, supportive and mentoring. Each of these topics is discussed in a separate chapter, with each chapter neatly summarized in a series of rules to live by.The other emphasis made by Walters is that leadership is an art, not a science - and perfection is a direction not an attainment. These concepts emphasize continuous improvement, but understanding - a trait that many leaders need to develop.A great little book that belongs in any library."
5,GREAT BOOK,"BEING IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, THIS BOOK WAS NOT ONLY ENTERTAINING, BUT VERY ACCURATE. IT WAS VERY FUNNY BUT SERIOUS AT TIMES. GALLOWAY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH WHAT GOES ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS. ONCE AGAIN THE BOOK WAS GREAT AND I WILL READ IT OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN. ANYONE WHO GOES OUT TO DINE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!! THANKS JOHN."
3,den enda segern,"In this book Hamilton has to prevent and stop nuclearsmuggling from Russia to Sweden and finaly to Libya. This book is really good criminal thriller. It can keep you awake for many hours when you read it. Jan Guillou can really write so it makes shivers go down your spine, and this book wasn't any diffrent. This book has many political aspects. It views Sweden as an Country thats controlled by the USA. Cause they're against the Palestiniens and they get their orders from CIA."
5,Reliving,"I saw AMC live five days prior to this recording at the legendary Maxwell's in Hoboken, NJ. Seeing this band live is so sublime, and I am grateful to now have this CD so I can relive that night over and over. The humor, fury, power, beauty, pathos and passion of this band are all on fine display here, and this is an essential CD."
4,well worth the read...,"its well worth picking it up and reading it as it shows what life is like on hondo island and not in the megatropolis. there is a section towards the end of the book where the text doesnt flow, but it gave me a few laughs and a better understanding of enthusiasm of japan. i highly recommend it. if you're preparing to goto japan for the jet program or just for a holiday, have a read."
3,Fit the bill,These filters are on the middle ground as for filters but I change my filters a couple time during an oil life.I have done alot of testing on engines and found if you change filter halfway between oil changes the motor would last 30 to 50% longer. This is from many differant engines and years.
1,This tripe was on Masterpiece Theatre???,"Not only was the plot full of holes, the acting was horrendous! If possible, I would have given this film zero stars. Nothing in this story is even plausible. It isn't even worth a review except to warn you to avoid it like the plague. Ugh!"
3,Only one complaint....,"I bought this watch for convenience and wearing it every day to work, the band almost immediately looked dirty. Other than that, I've really enjoyed it."
3,Nice ... but not what I was looking for,Even in reading the other reviews I thought I would order this watch. It is fine for my purpose (to wear while my fiance and I remodel our home) but I do not like how much velcro is exposed as well as it is very small. If you have large wrists what-so-ever ... I wouldn't recommend this product.Overall really cute ... just glad I didn't spend that much to destroy it during our remodel!
3,Wellness Core adult and kitten food,"This is indeed a much better alternative to the mainstream dry cat food. No dyes, (which is more and more the cause of vomiting in cats), no significant carbs-a key cause of feline diabetes which is on the rise also. That said, the reaction of our family's cats to this was mixed, a couple really liked it, others who are not fond of fish only nibbled at it. It has a significant fishy, meat odor when opened which luckily isn't as pervasive as cooked onions or bacon. However since it is high in protein your cats will use the litter box more often.Lastly, yes, it is more expensive, but how much do you spend on yourself every month for food? You made a commitment when you got your pet, so if you love your cat and want your companion to be healthy and around for a longer time then buy this food, or Innova. This is not a cure, just a healthier more natural diet for your cat."
2,7 Cats would rather Starve,"Two households and 7 cats later, I still have an almost full bag of this stuff. I put it out because I ran out of their regular food, and couldn't make it to the store right away. My 4 cats, despite not having eaten in almost a whole day, won't go near this stuff. It just sits in their bowl. When I first brought it into the house, they tried it, but haven't eaten it since. I would not recommend it, despite the good ingredients"
2,Basic and Misleading Treatment of World Art,"This series was a great disappointment. I expected a much better product from the BBC and related organizations. World history was greatly embellished by obvious speculation to the point that it almost became 'reality TV'. This is not for those who are looking for well packaged facts. Nevertheless the series is watchable and if you dont mind the embellishment, missing information, plethora of speculation etc it is not too bad."
4,Great Shoulder Rest,"I switched to this shoulder rest from a very basic one and count this as a good upgrade from your very standard ""padded bar"". It is very comfortable and I do not have any issues with it falling off of the instrument as I did my previous rest.The arms that attach to the instrument itself have a little notch in them to avoid it from falling off and it is rubberized so it doesn't move around once you get it on there snuggly.It dips nicely in the middle to make a minimal gap between you and the instrument so your neck is not put at an awkward angle and is very comfortably padded."
1,Wrong cable for this camera!,"This cable does not fit the Coolpix 800, as advertised. Buy at your own risk."
5,Finally!,I was lucky enough to catch this production of The Pirates Of Penzance on Broadway in 1981 and was happy to see that the movie version looked as if it was lifted right from the stage. Simply marvelous rendering of a classic Gilbert & Sullivan operetta. The only change made was the casting of Angela Landsbury portraying Ruth. Estelle Parsons originated the role on stage. But Angela is divine as always! I am thrilled beyond words that this is finally coming to DVD. I can finally get rid of my old VHS copy of this wonderful film.
4,Unorthodox but fun,"G&S purists will not like this show. They've added songs from other G&S operettas, even invaded (literally) a scene from HMS Pinafore. Moreover, Linda Ronstadt, whom I like when she's backed by Nelson Riddle, is not an ideal Mabel (it's well above her range), and the man who plays Frederick (I don't remember his name and don't want to be reminded) is totally inadequate (he croons everything). Nevertheless, the spirit of fun which is present throughout more than compesates for the shortcomings mentioned. If you can forget the performances you have seen, and possibly participated in, and just approach this as a fun show kind of based on G&S's Pirates, you'll have a good time; I did."
5,Pirates of Penzance,The best of all the G & S productions - in my opinion. The script is infectiously hilarious for those who can catch it - a delight!
5,Finally it is out on dvd. with Angela as the nanny,"Don't get me wrong, I like the version with Ms. Routledge (Hyacinth Bucket) as the governess/nanny, BUT Angela is the part as far as I am concerned. Not going into who might sing the best etc. I just like the way Ms. Landsbury plays the part. Everyone else was the same cast, Kevin,Linda,Tony as the Bobby, and of course the Major General. Get them both and compare or just enjoy the show with the varied cast. They are both excellent and worth having in your library of movies. A++ all around."
5,Musical Delight,"If you love musicals, this is THE one to have! It is fun, entertaining, and the music is great. This is the only version of this production which we will ever watch!"
3,Good but not the best,"I don't see why people try to review the stories when most of the time we already know the story and many times it will spoil the movie so I will just let that part go and give my opinion on the quality of the performance.I had seen the play once way back when and I can remember many of the impressive songs and acting that was involved with that, well the movie does a good job with this but it doesn't transfer from the stage to film as well as other musicals, but the sound is good and the acting is great, it is worth at least a rental to see if you like it then I would go for the buy latter.P.S. you probably won't like it too much unless you like the good ol' cheesy musical comedy, which this is."
2,Mushy and floral...,"Anyone looking up this book on Amazon will likely be at least a little familiar with Turing and Godel and their contributions to modern science, and will not expect this book to be scientific or philosophically challenging. But few will expect a short novel this mushy, gushing, floral, and poorly edited. It comes off like a college creative writing project rather than an actual work of historical fiction, with the author/narrator standing in the way of the book's momentum at every turn.Great idea for a book - but many people, particularly those in science, may find the style queasy and borderline unreadable..."
4,genius in parallel,"it's tough to write of genius and make it understandable for non-genius readers. this book has explored the math/cyber worlds of the mid century in bletchley/london and in vienna. two lives that, absent genius, were dysrunctional. good read."
4,Amazingly Brilliant,"The text is amazingly brilliant. Very well written and glued & will surely expand your vocabulary. Although a novel, it is still (mostly) based on solid and true facts. Only where necessary were the facts altered or modified for the sake of cohesion.Alternating between Godel & Turing, the reader can get a bit confused for a while but will soon get his grips on the text , specially that the last part is dominated by the details of Turing's war-time life until his self-prepared cold death.A great book highly suggested to everyone who has no or very little idea of these two brilliant mathematicians [& philosophers]. It can serve as a first book or introduction to their lives and work in a very interesting, entertaining & enlightening way."
2,Getting worst and worst... but I can't help myself to go on,"Stories of the series are getting worst by each new season. Transfer quality is not different than poor old VHS copies. And it's not anamorphic. Lack of English subtitle is big mistake, because you can't understand muffled dialogs very well via poor sound quality."
4,The Menace of Everything,"Madeline Drexler's book is as frightening as she wants it to be. Secret Agents is a gripping, well-written fast read that should deeply frighten everyone on first glance. The subtitle is the menace of emerging infections but it could almost be changed to the menace of everything. There seems little escape from the possible scenarios she clearly presents (and this clarity is definately one of the book's strengths as she makes bio-science quite understandable for the layperson.) The chapter on the West Nile Virus that begins the book is particularly exciting and will the hook the reader immediately. If one pauses to look at the actual numbers, the book is somewhat less frightening as the numbers of deaths are always substantially below many of the doom-sayers' predictions, although she will repeatedly tell the reader this may not always be so. A fascinating book for our times."
2,Doesn't work right,"The product is exactly what I wanted, but it doesn't work right. The telescopic pole does not lock when extended. When you try to push the snow, the pole colapses. This is NOT helpful."
5,Wish I would have found this sooner!,"Not sure how I lived in PA for 33 years and never saw one of these for sale at a local store, but I'm glad I bought one. I know its not the cheapest thing out there but it was worth every penny to me. We just got a heck of a storm, dumping 2 feet. This cleaned off both my cars in record time. If you live where winters bring alot of white stuff, are sick of not being able to reach parts of your vehicle, or just want the job down faster, buy this! You won't be sorry!"
5,great for snow removal,"Where has this thing been all of my life? Forget trying to remove feet of snow off of your vehicle with that tiny little brush. This ""broom"" pushes it right off!!Make sure to wear gloves, as the metal handle gets very cold in the cold temperatures. I did not wear gloves because I figured I would be done in minutes with this handy contraption.While I still hate snow, I don't hate cleaning my car as much anymore now that I have the Sno Brum. I will be purchasing many for Christmas gifts!"
4,VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!,"Excellent for Trucks,SUV & Vans.Sometimes becomes loose during operation,so make sure you tight it well before removing snow.My spouse liked it too much.Very good product ,couldn't find it in Walmart,Target etc."
4,Styrofoam on a Stick,"Basically what the title says. It is useful to clean off large amounts of snow from the cars, but it's not great for getting into all the crevices. A smaller brush tool would still be needed in this case, or just use your hands. I can't comment on the durability, as I've only used it once, but it doesn't seem like it will last much longer than 5 years or so...we'll see."
5,So Effective!,"I'm in central NY state, and we get a fair bit of snow. This has made cleaning snow off my car so much easier than the brushes I was using before. I now clean my whole car (including roof) in less time that it took for just the windshields earlier. You still need a ice-scraper for the ice, but this is perfect for snow. I did manage to tear a corner of the soft material by driving it hard against my windshield wiper, so just use it gently. This doesn't need force anyway."
2,cheap goods,"While this product does the job it is pretty cheaply made. I had meant to get the Arctic Plow which is a much sturdier, better made model. Obviously my mistake. Still it gets the job done. I just don't think it's worth the price."
1,Not worth keeping in the car,"This thing has absolutely no scraping function to it. As a result, if your car is not ice cold when the snow starts, you'll have little frozen bits of ice on the windows, under the snow. This device will not remove that. It only gets rid of loose snow--for that, I guess it's OK, but in Western MA where I live, it's rare to have so much snow that this thing is really needed."
2,Great but telescopic handle blows,This tool worked great except for the locking telescopic handle (why I bought it). It kept sliding in use so I tightened it all the way. Worked great but now is stuck in that position and will not release even when using (JAR REMOVER PADS). Now its too long to fit in the car without being a pain in the ass. This telescopic handle is defective like Obama's policies. Lets hope both are gone soon and the world in not destroyed by defective thinking.
5,amazing book!,I love storm constantine and The Wraiths of Will and Pleasure is an amazing addition to the Wraeththru series. Definitely worth reading!
1,Hell No!,There is no other way to put it but HORRIBLE...this CD is absolutely horrible! I have never purchased a less redeeming CD ever.
1,Not For Me!!!,"I hate these earphones. The sound is OK, but the comfort is terrible. They make my ears hurt after just a few minutes. They grab onto the little hairs in my ears and it hurts when I pull them off and those hairs come out too! Plus it kinda freaks me out that the part that goes into your ear is magnetized!??!! I keep them at work just in case I forget to bring in my more comfortable pair, but I usually keep them on the outside of my ear and just turn them up a little louder."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I became aware of this CD (and Brule) on my first trip to Arizona. It was just about the perfect thing to listen to on the trip from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon. It's perhaps a bit more accessible to the general public than a lot of Native American music (which I do like anyway). I file this with my ambient stuff, but although it's very relaxing it's also quite listenable. Years later it still holds up for me. I purchased it a second time when my first copy became damaged so there's an endorsement. I wish I had the opportunity to see Nicole and Brule live, but maybe someday."
3,Flutist from Big & Rich Fame,"If you love Big & Rich, this is worth checking out. Nicole is the flutist from Brule who plays flute in the Big & Rich song ""Wild West Show."""
4,Not for young children,"I'm a dreamer, like Dragonfly, and so are my daughters, and I'll give this book to them to read when they are older. It was a very scary book. And the prose would be difficult reading for a third grader, and maybe even a fifth grader. I like Mr. Durbin's style -- the writing is beautiful. His detailed descriptions of the world in the basement and the people of the basement are what makes it such a scary and beautiful story.This is a good book for people who like scary books, and for people who believe that there really are scary things in this world but we can have the power to live with scary things."
2,Not what i expected,"I love the design and colors, but the ball part of the skipper is not heavy enough. The only way to keep it going is to jump really, really fast, witch is kinda hard to do for more then a few seconeds. I love the idea but it falls short of what I was looking for."
1,Awful!,"Do not buy this toy-- it is poorly made plastic that never worked-- got tangled in my kids and my legs, doesn't loop around well, and the ball started falling apart after a few days. Total waste of money!!"
5,The Best Game Ever!!!!!!!!,"This is my absolute favorite game! My parents got it for me for Christmas and I was hooked! I've finished the game twice, almost three times now. Chapter 12 is really hard, and in Chapter 17 to defeat the Witch wait till she leans over, then do a Unified Face. Aslan will then come and (my friend says) bite her head off. It's not fair though, that Peter is the leader in eight of the chapters and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy only get to be the leader in three. I love this game!!!! :)"
3,Too short!!,This game was very fun to play. But just as I was really getting into it - it was over!It probably didn't help that I had just finished a couple of weeks of the latest Zelda game!
3,"I love Narnia, but","After playing the PS2 version of Narnia I expected a close level of attention to this gameboy advance title; however, it seems it was slapped together very quickly. The game is very linear and plot elements are skimmed through so quickly; they miss some scenes from the book/movie. Graphics and sound are good, but the pevensies aren't drawn very well. If you get an item, leave the area, come back, the item is there again, so you can really stock up. Short game, and i wish it was more expansive and not so linear."
2,Very Disappointed,"This must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. No fault of the actors; the story is slow and fails to draw one in. I thought it would be a good movie based on the reviews I read here. I'm sorry to say, this is not the case. I was extremely disappointed with this movie because I expected much, much more. It failed to deliver. I give it two stars instead of one because of the acting which is good given that they did not have much to work with in terms of the script. I'm selling this movie to a used movie emporium. I have no desire to watch it again."
3,A much-needed book that falls a bit short,"I was attracted to this book by its premise: that our society's pluralism and disdain for Christianity has pushed believers into the closet (so to speak). However, Hewitt's work reads like a loosely-connected string of essays that don't end up leading toward any real conclusions. There are many good nuggets here, but you have to put up with an overall lack of flow and coherence to find them. Also, the author doesn't seem to consider the possibility that Christians might legitimately grapple with a proper posture toward neighbors of different faiths who find their beliefs meaningful and life-changing. We are called to tell our story, but how do we do that in a winsome, open way? A chapter on that issue would have lent balance to this work."
4,Expectations met,I bought this recorder after I gave up trying to get another recorder to work. This one did work just as the instruction manual prescribed. It was actually easier to use than the previous one and I was able to make several DVD's from my old family videos.
1,Panasonic DVD Recorders w/ Harddrives are prone to failure,"I purchased a Panasonic DVD recorder with a harddrive about 18 months ago. Unfortunately, the harddrive malfunctioned just beyond the warranty period and I now have a useless $500 piece of junk. A coworker of mine also purchased a Panasonic DVD recorder around the same time and experienced problems with three of them before giving up and buying a JVC. From my experience, I'd advise anyone buying a DVD recorder to steer clear of Panasonic, as they are prone to failure."
2,Mini mouse for my computer,It click every time I use it and it is hard to click. Seem to not always work.It is slow
3,A handy little widget,I got this to go with my laptop so smallness is essential. The mouse is a little larger than a mini candy bar and works smoothly and easily. The only issue I have is that the cord on my model doesn't retract all the way.
1,Hopeless,this holster had a warranty for 90 days. It broke around the 95th day. i think that it is not worth spending ... for it.
5,Great book!,"Great book. Great condition when I received it. It came sooner than I expected, which was nice. Thanks!"
5,Very pleased with this book.,"This book arrived quickly in excellent condition. Full of awesome information on all kinds of subjects that pertain to self sufficiency. I don't believe there's any one book to cover anything because things are constantly changing and evolving. That being said I think this book is full of very useful information that seems to have been gained through experience and not just copied from reference material. It not only has good information on organic gardening and farming (rural and urban) but also includes info on forging metal, home brewing, basket making, weaving and dying, making your own workshops and tools, etc. I saw this book at a friends house and after flipping through I knew I had to have it for myself and my family."
2,There are much better books than this,"I was disapointed by this book. The book is written totally from the context of living in England. The author is a very poor communicator, he reminds me of an intellectual trying to explain how to farm with poetry and quotes from his vast knowledge of classic books.I have been farming now for a few years and have some experience growing my own corn, vegatables etc.. I also raise catttle and horses. (I am also a licensed Vet in Texas) This author does not know what he is talking about on alot of animal husbandry issues and I see alot of ridiculous nonsense in his teachings of growing crops vegetables etc..To make a long story short, if you live in the U.S. don't buy this book, it is really awful. There is a far better book....""The encyclopedia of country living"" by Carla Emery"
4,Botanicals,"I have no problem with the product, which I have used many times before, but I have a complaint on the way I received it. I waited 2 weeks for delivery & when it finally arrived it came from Hong Kong & needed a signature. As I was not at home for the first attempt on a Saturday, I did not get it until the following week when I had to pick it up at the local Post Office.It was inconvenient to say the least & seemed way too complicated for aproduct that is sold at many local stores.I used AMAZON because you have always had very quick delivery so this was a surprise & disappointment.I was also never told that there would be a delay of any kind.I have always had very good service through AMAZON in the past."
3,Not quite universal enough...,"This car seat is probably great, but please check what car seats it goes with as the title is quite deceptive. We bought a major name brand and it didn't work with this so-called universal car seat carrier."
1,Don't buy if you have Graco SnugRide car seat,"I only looked at the stars, but should have carefully read the reviews. The Graco SnugRide car seat does not securely fit on this car seat carrier. I am going to try to return and get a Graco carrier."
3,Tiger Poster ... check size!,"I bought this tiger poster among others and found out it was pretty dinky. Be sure to check the sizes on your posters you are thinking of buying. Other than size problem, it is a nice poster, almost looks like a real photograph!"
4,Doctors can treat too much,"This book opened my eyes to something I was almost totally ignorant of, that medical treatment is often based on anecdotal motivation, not on a scientific basis. Dr Hadler points out this problem especially in the US and especially for a few health problems (cardiac and cancer).I take this as a warning to be skeptical of medical care and the balance of how the system profits taken against any real measure of benefits to people or statistical benefits to society.I would give it 5 stars for content, thoughtfulness, and potency. I mark it down a bit only that Dr Hadler chose to write it himself and is clearly not a writer. Writing is not bad, but tedious at points."
2,"A ""typically contemptuous"" book","The format of this book is good as far as general information andlayout are concerned, but underlying its theme throughout is thespirit of typically arrogant contemptuousness, best exemplified by the now exposed and infamous ""Reaganist"" approach of the 1980s which is known all too well. This is totally unacceptable for works of this type."
3,Forced...,"The Polish Pzoniak family centers around the mother Jadzia (Lena Olin), who is married to Bolek (Gabriel Byrne), a baker. Jadzia is heavily ""active"" within the Polish Women's Organization. Her activity within the Polish Women's Organization is just a front for her frequent romantic rendezvous with Roman. The saying, mother like daughter, clings correct here, since her daughter Hala (Claire Danes), a high school drop out, is seeing a young neighborhood policeman and becomes pregnant. In the process, she is chosen by regions of the catholic church to represent the innocence of Virgin Mary while she is pressing the young policeman to marry her. Polish Wedding has tremendously gifted cast and the cinematography enhances the real impression of the film. Nevertheless, the plot seems to be moving aimlessly and the purpose of the story is lost early in the film, which provides for a dreary cinematic experience."
2,"Slow, Ethnically Offensive, Ameteurish","The movie treats it subjects with utter disrespect and lack of sympathy. All the Polish men are shown as chauvinist dimwits that are completely manipulated by their women who speak about religion, devotion and family only to act like sex-crazed kittens.Suffices to say that if the movie was made about some other ethnic minorities the Anti-Defamation League would drag it to court.But don't take my word for it - just watch it back to back with ""My Fat Greek Wedding"" and then tell me that both movies explored ethnicity with same amout of sympathy and respect.Shame on the filmmakers and shame on the studio!"
3,Great Actors,"I just saw this movie and thought it was good. The mother is a strong but complex woman. The father came off as a weak man who is willing to forgive anything. The daughter a confused young girl who knows who she loves. The best part was seeing Adam Trese in this movie, he was better looking than ever. I went to high school with him in N.Y. and had no idea how interested he was in acting. He was great and looked like a pro. I'm really looking forward to seeing him in future films. Good Luck Adam!"
1,Not worth a penny,"I am Polish and this is one of the most offensive movies I've ever seen. I know the difference between poking fun at your heritage and degrading it. This was definitely the latter. The movie was boring, base and had no point. I threw it out after watching it. My husband (who is not polish) felt the same way. He was shocked. We both loved ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". My husband is part Greek. ""My Polish Wedding"" was not funny, not cute, not intelligent, and certainly not accurate."
3,Busting stereotypes,"Let me say first that if this film had been entitled, Pennsylvania Dutch Protestant Wedding, I might have had a different reaction to it.Ultimately, though, it's about the truth behind the image people present of themselves and so its business is one of busting stereotypes, specifically the most mundane and therefore common stereotypes of life--Mother, Wife, Father, Husband, Daughter, Brother . . . Carl Jung would have loved this film. When people present themselves as icons, trouble is apt to follow.The final act is hilarious in that it could happen in any family and any culture and proves that real life is apt to exciting enough even for a drama queen."
5,awesome,"Claire Danes was so great in this movie, she played a wonderful part. Never seen a movie with so much emotions in it."
2,Good acting...no story,"Some good imagery. I loved the opening with all the beautiful mediaeval/Renaissance art of cherubic babies and voluptuous nudes.Beautiful Claire Danes is superb as a mixed up teen, Hala, which gets her pregnant, thereby presenting a problem for her devoutly Catholic family.Sexy Lena Olin plays her strong willed and fiery mother, and Gabriel Byrne her thoughtful baker father.Great acting and probably a good portrayal of the Polish area of Detroit, but where is this movie going?It drags, there is no real story and perhaps it is simply supposed to be a Polish-American version of the Irish classic ""The Snapper"" (1994).And I didn't like the guy, Schuster the local cop, who got Hala knocked up either. He can't get any expression other than that blank stare, right to the end. I don't know why Hala wanted to marry him!"
4,Definitely Different,"An interesting movie and well acted. A refreshingly different story-line. All of the actors did a good job making their characters credible. I wouldn't watch this movie again, but it was worth watching once. Don't expect too much and just sit back and enjoy. No FX. Just a look at an average (?) family, their trials and tribulations. The movie focuses on the young teenage daughter, but offers some insight into the Mother and Father and their personal struggles with everyday life, which is what this movie is about. It probably does not protray the Polish ethinic very well, but I don't think that is the point of this flick. An interesting, light hearted look into the boring, humdrum existence of family life."
4,Beautiful Film,"I have seen this movie numerous times and it never gets old. There's so much going on in the story- about Claire Danes, her mother, father, and the rest of her family- to keep the movie interesting and funny everytime. I especially like how it shows the many traditions of a Polish family and community. Definitely worth buying!"
2,Did not meet expectations,"After I recieved this product Iwas really excited to try it out. After putting it together and pumping up the ball, I go to use it and the base snaps apart while I am on the ball doing some of the moves. I thought bummer, either I am just way to heavy that I split it or I did not put it together properly. I know it wasn't the latter b/c it only snaps together, so maybe I was just to darn big. Another thing I did not like is the fact that the ball is really small. You look at the lady using it on the site and think that it is a decent size ball...maybe for someone that is 5'7 and not 5'10. So, all in all it was not made for me."
2,White Fang Complete Series,"Just purchased this DVD. The stories are okay but watching it is very annoying because it runs through 3 minutes worth of credits and intro's for every single story. The episodes are very short.Do yourself a favor and purchase Call of the Wild with Shane Meier and Nick Mancuso. TV Series featuring 8 episodes, far better all the way around."
4,rare masters released at last,"perfectly produced compilation of her long lost originalhits including music, and the never before released on cd choon gum novelty hit that followed. Very rare, very good."
2,Not too helpful,"I was disappointed. There is nothing mentioned in this book about how to go about getting health insurance for yourself or how to pay your taxes as an independent practitioner. It's all about how to make your business grow, which is great, but what about the fact that while you are a therapist you are also a business person?"
4,I'm with EthenAllen95...,"As fun as: Beating yourself sensless with a 10 foot poleBetter than: the first game ever madeWishes it was: Hideo KojimaWhoever made this game...er...game...making..engine...should die of ghonerrah and go straight to hell. Unless you have a strong ambition, a good brain, and about 4 months of free time, do not buy this game! Even when you do get it done(which I have never even come close to doing) its still horrible (you can't see your characters during fights!!). A big waste of $50, plus the other $50 I spent on the keyboard for it. HUGE waste of a $250 Christmas spending limit...HUGE. PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE BY BUYING THIS GAME!"
5,Wonderful!!! I love this tape,"This is a great video, with all her video clips (at the date of release). Before each filmclip there is a picture of the CD single that it comes from. I love this video, not only because it's Tori, but it has all the amazing videos like 'caught a lite sneeze' (personal favourite) and china. If you get this, you will not be disapointed."
2,"Nah, it's so so...","Maybe if you're a really hardcore fan of Tori Amos, this is fine... Tori Amos thinks she's all that, but she really ain't. Pretty good records though."
1,This bugs me,"I don't understand. I live in norway, and I would really like to buy this video, but it seems like i can't. can anyone tell me; if I buy thios video, can i watch it at home in norway on my own vcr? i really hope so. if not, is there somewhere I cab buy it so that i CAN see it at home in my own country? please answer me!(s: i am not from the u.s. but i had to fill in something... they didn't except norway as a real country)"
1,Bad choice,"Hoping it would be a great detail book(even more coming from who it's supposing to come from), it is no good at all.In fact, although its name is ""Macromedia FlashMX"" most of the book talk about Flash 5 features.If you are a begginer, it might be a good book (Although there are a lot of them better than this one), for an expert guy, forget it and buy Branden Hall's one."
1,Gross!,I'm a huge fan of the pumpkin flavoring Dunkin Donuts uses and I was hoping this would come close. No such luck. This stuff smells like Southern Comfort and is sickeningly sweet. Not much of a pumpkin flavor and no hint of spices at all. I ended up dumping the stuff down the drain.
5,"Wonderful tase! Ignore the 1 star reviews, they are for Pumpkin SPICE","As noted, the 1 star reviews say pumpkin spice in the writing. The pumpkin spice has a different flavor. This flavor actually taste like pumpkin pie and it is my favorite in the fall and winter seasons :)"
2,Comic Relief A Big Dissappointment,"The greatest was fun; the latest (2nd disc) I shredded and then threw away. BAD There are not 75 worthy words to cover this DVD and I am a fan of Whoppi, Billy Crystal and Robyn Williams, but there is a point..."

3,I guess it's better than nothing,"After owning ""Cross Purposes-Live"" on VHS and finding out that it was being released on DVD I was very excited because VHS tapes do wear out.Was it worth it?Let's see,the DVD is shorter than the VHS.The remastering isn't too good.The beginning of ""Feels Good to Me"" is cut off.I could keep going on but those are my biggest complaints.I give it 3 stars because:1.It's Tony Martin era Sabbath 2.I'm a true Black Sabbath fan 3.It saves wear an tear on my VHS."
3,Un peu leger...,Toujours un peu de frisson en voyant un si grand groupe sur scene. Le son est tres bon mais l'image laisse a desirer; quant au contenu (10 morceaux) ....!! No comment.Dommage car les DvD's avec Tony Martin sont plutot rares (quelle voix!!).
2,A Cardboard Cherub,"This is the third film by Lukas Moodysson (""Show me love"", ""Together""), and it's definitely not of the same caliber as the first two. Some of the plot details are not quite convincing, even in the light of harsh post-Soviet realities. But this is a minor flaw when compared to terrible acting by the main supporting actor (Artyom Bogucharsky). Every single line this ""cardboard"" cherub recites sounds artificial, as if memorized by rote, and badly at that. This renders all of the scenes in which he is involved unconvincing. The film is carried by the main heroine (Oksana Akinshina), who is, no doubt, a very talented actress. Overall, the film disappoints - I expected nothing short of great from Lukas Moodysson."
2,I feel this book was not truthful,I think Jamaice Kincaid book was not truthful about what she was saiding about her family it was one sided I feel we should hear her mother's side and give her a fair chance.
3,the book was very interesting.,I thought the book was very good and very nicely writting.Even though kinkaid didn't like her mother very much or at all she could have said a sentence that made her mother seem a little more nicer.
3,A page turner but not as pleasing as I would have thought.,"I thought that this book could have been alot better than it was. In this book, i could tell two things--one that she hated her mother and cared deeply about her brother and 2) that her writing as well as relationships need improvement. Her descriptions were excellent but introduce her brothers homosexuality at the time that she did made no point in this novel. Her relationship was her mother was pointless and overall i hated the ending."
4,Ultimate Luciano,Recently went to see Luciano in concert at HQ Manchester - a fantastic show. Good support acts. Never seen Luciano before and he was incredible -so just had to purchase CD to add to my collection.Ultimate Collection is a brilliant CD. Cannot say it's Luciano at his best as I would have to say that about all his music.
2,design flaw,"Although the device worked well, it has a design flaw in its connection which they conveniantly don't show in the picture. The docking station connects to the computer via a semi-rigid cord which must u to connect. Certain HP laptops such as mine also need an extra adapter to connect. This creates a constant tug on the connection which means any presure on the cord causes it to disconnect.After less than a year with frequent disconnects the adapter lost many of its fine metal connection pieces into the laptops connection bay. Now, you must replace the adapter as well as figure out how to pull all the fine metal peices out of your laptop that are stuck there. There also is no number on the adapter to figure out what you need to replace. I tried a local BestBuy and they said I have to get a replacement from HP."
3,More Self Promotion,"If you need help promoting your practice, this gives you many ideas on what and how to do it. As to the forms, no new ideas here."
1,"Oh, sorry, I must have been snoring.","The Butcher (Edward Gorsuch, 2006)And here we have, yes, another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie. Bad acting. Increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule (instead of straight kids having sex, there's a pair of lesbians, who must, of course, suffer gruesome ends-- this isn't a spoiler, as the first occurs in the extended opening scene. So the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring. Silly, anyone?). Awful, awful script. Incredibly predictable plot twist. Yeah, there's really nothing good to say about this movie. Some wag on the IMDB boards called it (forgive my paraphrasing) a bad remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre combined with a bad remake of The People Under the Stairs, and he's right. *"
4,Nice.,"I've been looking around for a while for a decent case for my GBA, but all of them just seemed too small. Not so with this one. Plenty of room for 9 GBA (plus one in the system makes 10), and there is also plenty of room for an AC adaptor (maybe not the Mad Katz, but the official one), a link cable, and a few other odds and ends.I highly recomend this case for anyone getting a GBA, but get it soon, you don't want to end up like me and have scratches all over your screen (which is very very easy to do)."
3,"Nice design, BRIGHT display","I like the design and options on this alarm, but the display is way too bright. I didn't buy a comparable Sony because of reviews I read that said that display was too bright, but now I wish I had got that one since the Philips is just as bad or worse."
2,Not As Strong As The First or His Latter Work Just Aight,As a fan I felt that Keith Sweat suffered a huge sophmore slump with his I'll Give All My Love to You disc. The fast club orienated tracks just weren't as strong this time around and there were only two slow jams;I'll Give All My Love To You and Merry Go Round that impressed me. Sweat came back hard on his thrid CD Keep It Comin but this is the one Sweat CD that I gets little roation in my CD player.
5,How to do for the software exec,"The book provides a well ordered how-to-do list for senior software executives. From managing technology, to managing personnel, 100 questions has the answers."
5,Only buy name brand filters....,"and Nikon is one of them. If you own Nikon lenses I suggest you get this if not B + W or other quality name brands. With the Nikon NC filter, I see no yellow tint as opposed to my HOYA filter."
4,Nikon 67mm Screw-on Neutral Color Filter,This filter is for me just a lens protection. I feel more comfortable when using this filter on my expensive lenses and it do not degrade the quality of my pictures.
5,Nioxin System 3 Cleanser for Chemically Treated Hair,This product was highly recommended by my great friend who is one of the best hairstylists I've ever known to help me as I was dealing with the hair-thinning effects of menopause. It has been amazing to how well it works and how well my hair handles as another benefit. It is fantastic and I so love the price I get through Amazon!
1,My son was very disappointed in this action figure,I bought this and another action figure for my son. My son was not satisfied with his purchase. He tried to contact the gentleman that he purchased it from and I think he had problems getting him to say he could get his money back. Now we are stuck with a figure that he doesn't like and I am out the money for it as well.
2,Not very sanitary,"I owned Zyliss spinner with the pull cord which I purchased in 2008.It unsanitary because the cord stayed wet and I had to pull on and stretch it out in order for it to dry. It was akward having to pull the cord out, wrap it around the top and lay it down in such a way that the cord would not retract.It also ended up getting warped in the dishwasher although I used the top rack only.It did dry the salad, I will say that much.But who designs a top that cannot adequately drain? If I am not mistaken they treat the cord with something to keep down the pathogen count, but that is even worse.BTW, I contacted Zyliss about this design and they told me the cord is treated with something to keep down the pathogen count and they they were working on a new design. This was back in 2008.I got rid of it and purchased an OXO model which I am pleased with."
2,"Easy to spin, but disappointing results","I was at first very excited with my new Zyliss salad spinner - it looks great, and it's much easier to spin than the older string-pull version (not to mention the old-school ""pump"" versions, which required a lot of effort). However, as another reviewer mentions, it simply does not get your greens very dry. I've been surprised and disappointed by the amount of water left on lettuce after spinning, and spinning, and spinning."
3,Lid hard to clean,"Pros: it does dry lettuce fairly well and it is large enough for all my salad/leafy veggie needs.Cons: 1) Cleaning the lid. It is made of two pieces attached at the center, and when cleaning water easily gets trapped there (and other tiny bits of food, too, if you put it into the dishwasher). I have not found a way to separate the two (I don't think it's designed to) and I therefore have to drip dry it on its side, rotating once one half is done drying. That makes this salad spinner more work than it needs to be and has me calling in question its cleanliness. 2) Inner basket is a bit flimsy, but not enough that it doesn't do it's job so that's a minor complaint.If it weren't for the double lid I'd give this spinner a higher rating. I'm actively looking for a better spinner with a one piece lid if anyone has suggestions!"
2,Monica can do better,Monica's Miss Thang is much better than The Boy is Mine. Monica can clearly sing better than Brandy but she doesn't have the great producers like Brandy I think she needs to try different producers because Dallas Austin is a Timbaland wanna be and Jermaine Dupri is just old Monica could easily knock Brandy off the charts if she would get better production.
3,Monica needs to take some tips from Brandy!,"Monica needs to work on her lyrics! I don't know how anyone considers her an ""artist"" save your money! Monica needs a new job!"
2,Boring!,"I find Monica's music to lack passion. It is tired and uninspired. She sings well but who cares? I can only groove a few of the songs here. The lyrics are less than to be desired. Listen to Rage Against the Machine and see what lyrics are supposed to be like. And see what REAL passion in music is all about, too. --Kelly Magovern"
2,I can't believe I paid for this thing!!,"I thought this CD would be as good as Brandy's it was not a thing like Brandy's. The only song I like that she sung herseif was ""The First Night."" I don't know why she even bothered trying!!"
3,"She Can Do So Much Better, She Could Be An Angel!!!!!!","Monica is definately one of the best singers in 'da business but this is a poor example of what she can do. Rinng 'Da Bell, Street Symphony and Inside are nothing compared to The Boy is Mine, ANgel of Mine and FOr You I Will. Get now songs, Monica 'cause we miss u. Pick up Miss Thang instead of this and get Brandy's CD, the Angel of Mine single and you'll have all Moncia's talent on this disk. Go for more experienced singers like Mariah or Brandy. No matter how hard Monica tries, she'll never hold a candle to them, though."
2,"man, i just think it could be better...","Monica has such a terrific voice, but she's gotta sing better songs! there just to emotional and real! People like me don't want reality! they want the song to put fantisies in there heads and then blow them out of preportion! unless your an old granny who listens to crap all day nitting, i stongly recomend that you disregard all other ""opinions"" and try something more like ""dcTalk""!!"
5,"I think Monica is a great singer,but she neeeds her own web.",Monica is a wounderful singrer with a geart voice. She realy needs to have her own web-site.She is a perfect voice for the songs she sings.I would like to hear more songs by her.
5,WHEN I SAW YOU ON TV I FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND YOUR MUSIC,"MY NAME IS MARCELLA FLEMMING, I AM FROM THE WEST INDIES, ON THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND OF ST. KITTS AND I AM ONE OF YOUR BIGGEST FAN FROM THE TIME I SAW YOU ON TV. I ALSO HOPE YOU CAN SEND ME YOUR LATEST CD I HAVE THE OTHERS. MONICA YOU ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST SINGER IN HISTORY I EVER COME ACROSS. MY LOVE FOR YOU IS VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIAL MY ADDRESS MARCELLA FLEMMING THOMAS STREET POND'S PASTURE BASSETERRE ST.KITTS WEST INDIES IF THE CD IS NOT POSSIBLE, PLEASE WRITE ME A LINE. BYE FOR NOW AND LOVE ALWAYS, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
3,SHE CAN DO MUCH BETTER!,"Monica won me over with her first album because she sang it with soul and from the heart. This album lacks the intensity of the first and she doesn't even bother to put her all in any of the songs except Angel of Mine(which could have been song better), The Boy is Mine, and For You I Will(which is so old it had no business on there). Street Symphony, Take Him Back, and Across The Room will just barely pass simply because of the melodies. The only song I truly liked was The First Night and thats only because more artist need to encourage some kind of morals for young women today. The rest was too many remakes. I'm disappointed. Monica I know you can do much better."
4,jerome holla,da only reason i brought this album was for 2 reasons monica beauty and her 2 songs angel of mine and for you i will she can not sing but sang oh by the way look for her 4 album the makings of me due out in october holla
2,Could've been a lot better,"I'm sorry, but for a person her age with the voice that she has deserves to sing some better material! I knew right from the cover that her second album wasn't going to be as good as her first (that cover is cheesy!!!!). And why does she have so many remakes on her album?? There are some good songs (""Street Symphony,"" ""The First Night,"" and ""Ring the Bell."") But overall, it doesn't live up to the potential of her first album."
2,"THE CD is pretty lousy, and MONICA can not sing live","I was at Monica's concert in Milwaukee in Mid June, and she was HORRIBLE, man I thought she was really good and i had become a fan, until i head her sing live. She was awful, her voice was cracking constantly and you barely could hear her. I dont know what happened to her, but she made any old teenage girl look good. What happened to her, and the short hair looks bad, let it grow, or get some extensions."
3,It's Alright......,"Personally, I think Monica's last album was much better than this one. Only 4 of the songs were good: The Boy is Mine, The First Night, Right Here Waiting, and For You I Will. I find myself only listening to those songs when I do pick up this CD. If your not a BIG Monica fan, you can do without it...."
3,"Well, Monica could have done better...","OK, so this isn't the best record in the world. But it's a sophomore album! Go figure! Well, let'd get down to business. ""Street Symphony"" is a good song, ""Gone Be Fine"" is cool, ""The First Night"" is all right, ""Angel of Mine"" is sweet, but I've heard too much of it. The title track is the best- the only song I listened to over summer of 98- and ""Ring Da Bell"" is a good song. But even with all of these good songs, I stopped listening to it after a week or two. I'm just not feeling this record. Hopefully the next one will be better."
4,A great resource for teachers.,"Wolf has managed to capture the elements to success in many endeavors. As a teacher, I have found it useful both as a personal guide and as a teacher resource. I use the guides to goal setting for my students in vocational classes, and the brain teasers as a bridge to problem solving activities. This book has made it much easier for me to reach students by giving them concrete tools to help them in their career planning and basic education. I highly recommend it to teachers for this purpose, as well as an inspirational guide to the development of their own careers."
2,Really wanted to like this...,"As an avid Bruce Dickinson fan and a person who has always been fascinated by Crowley, I had high hopes for this movie. I hate to admit how very disappointed I am by it. Aside from some laugh-out-loud comical moments, this movie was utterly ridiculous. It feeds into the stereotypes of Crowley as a selfish hedonist, and the plot does not make much sense (I have a Master's degree from NYU and was still scratching my head in a sort of ""Huh?! What did I just see?!"" way). It's really a shame that this movie is so bad because Bruce Dickinson has such a great knowledge of Crowley and his works that this movie could have been something very special. And by the way, I am a horror enthusiast who definitely enjoys silly, campy horror, but I still could not get into this movie."
4,"Good price, helpful protection",I never want to go to a concert without these earplugs again... they've saved my ears a few times already. I like that I can adjust their placement in my ears and get different protection levels from sounds.
4,"Great sub, especially for price!","Bought this unit to replace a small, unpowered sub. I've been extremely happy with it. It has a frequency response range that's better than many subs nearly twice as expensive. If you're looking for an inexpensive sub, look no further."
5,Great Christmas Present!,"I got this as a christmas present and hooked up to my cheap RCA home theater system...and it sounds great! I love turning the bass level all the way up. When i do this the whole house vibrates. Overall, it is a very good subwoofer especially for the price!"
2,step away from the Sony,"The Sony SA-W2500 Performance Line 100 Watt Subwoofer is mediocre sound, mediocre looks, and barely worth the fifty bucks I paid for it. Do yourself a favor and get something like thePolk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black)for about the same price.Pros:+ Powers up+ Auto off worksCons:- Muddy bass at all settings and levels- INCREDIBLY UGLY plastic grille sticking out the back. Imagine a 70's era TV's backside - That's EXACTLY what this looks like on the backThis unit does put some rumble in a movie, or maybe some hip-hop, but it's incredibly boomy-muddy at all volumes. DO NOT use it for any music, except maybe in the garage. I'll give it two stars because it does work and isn't the worst subwoofer I've heard, but it is close to the worst. Hidden under my workbench attached to the garage stereo it's OK, but it's shunned from the house like a stinky dog."
3,for PC gaming,"I got this for my PC to play video games. It's obviously not very expensive, but it meets my needs for gaming. Unfortunately for me my dad is a dentist and has a $30K audio system in a dedicated sound room so I can kinda tell what I'm missing lol. If I ever get into home theater I would not bother using this. So my conclusion is: good for games only, or if you just dont have the money for something better."
4,Best thump for the buck!,"Have had this sub-woofer for about 6 weeks of daily use, and I am very pleased with it. Have noticed no popping or other distractions when used in ""auto"" mode to save energy. Musical and natural coupled with my Infinity bookshelf speakers. Exceptional buy."
4,Great Bass Great Price,This is my secondary surround system in my family room and it's more than enough to fill an 18x22 room using a low end Sony receiver.
5,A nice little Sub,"Great for a Small room and Theater setup.Not Boomie like I expected,Smooth Sub for Talking volumes and a little Rock.Theater sounds fine. Remember this is not a 12"" Speaker Its for theater Setups."
1,dont buy,This product is cheap junk. The motion sensor does not work.After resetting and changing all the settings as reccomended still does not work. Do not buy!
1,"Awful resolution, great movie. Find the movie elsewhere!","Note: My first experience with Amazon video download, so I may be doing something wrong.My experience with this movie is that from what I was able to tolerate watching it's an excellent, wonderfully done movie. Amazon, however, delivered the worst resolution and sound quality I've experienced in a long time. I had JUST gotten done watching a trailer on YouTube (excellent quality & sound) and decided to buy the movie. Bought and paid for it here - crap! Total s***. Fuzzy, blurry, and don't even think about going full-screen (on a computer monitor no less, not a big screen TV). The product was just unwatchable.I will update this if I figure out what the problem is. And I'm open to suggestions, but in the meantime this is the last Amazon video I buy. Terrible experience."
1,Works well until it doesn't,"Got this in late September and installed it on my old Schwinn bike. All features worked great (except the temperature display, which will read quite a bit higher if left out in the sun!) and I loved it.And then it died in the middle of a ride. The display became garbled and would not refresh. I reseated the battery, reconfigured it, and it worked - for another minute. And then it died again, this time for good. It would not revive even with a new battery.This bike computer lasted almost 11 months (less than 700 miles). The warranty is only three months.I threw it out and replaced it with another brand. Hope yours functions for longer."
5,Great buy!,"I feel like this bike computer is amazing! It really allows me to see what I'm doing as I;m biking and it has really upped my work-outs. I absolutely love it and for the price, it's a great buy!"
4,Very nice product for the price,"I thought the computer, particularly the control buttons looked pretty tacky right out of the box, but it works fine. Very, very easy to install (unlike stated by some reviewers) and extremely accurate. I like the scan funtion. I wish that when you cleared the current ride distance, the calories, fat calories and max speed would also clear, but maybe some people like to keep a running total on those. I would prefer only the total distance odometer to remain. But, overall it is a very nice little instrument at a very good price."
1,Terrible,This item doesn't work so never buy it. It is supposed to be a 17 function computer. 2 of them work. The time works and the temperature works. The temperature on this computer will usually be 30 degrees Feiranheit warmer than it actually is. it is teribbly designed and never told me speed or distance or anything! This product should not be purchased ever. I only rated it one star because that is the least you can give.
3,Schwinn 17-Function Bike Computer,"i was never really using it) might be good though, i just didnt really need it!"
1,did not work at all ...item returned,"Schwinn 20-Function Bike ComputerBad packaging. item did not work and returned,easy process,got my money back.I got what I pay for,just waste of time."
1,Incorrect reading,"For some reason, the kilometer reading on this device seems to be faulty.I picked it up while cycling with my husband. We travelled the same route, but had different kilometer readings.I then drove the same road with my car to confirm which reading was correct. Unfortunately, it seemed mine was incorrect."
5,Best Investment For My Bike,"This product ROCKS!!!! The only thing is, since I've received and installed it I ride everyday. Its addicting. The installation was easy and the functions work great. I've put over 300 miles on my bike in under a month. I went from riding about 2-3 miles a day to between 10-15 miles a day 6 times a week. Liked it so much I purchased this one for my wife :)"
