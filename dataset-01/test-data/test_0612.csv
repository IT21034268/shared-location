5,Fran says get a hold of Cary and your ears will thank you.,"Cary is one of those rare singer songwriters that come along and really deliver the GOODS. Get a hold of his music and it will stay in your cd player. And if you think that is good make sure to check him out live. I saw him open up for Liz Phair and he blew the crowd away. Who knew that the dirty long haul trucker looking guy could pour out his soul with just his guitar. Buy it now and tell your friends later, ""Man, I was listening to that guy back when he was playing nightclubs and bars. It is so much better than these stadium tours."" ""I even had a beer with the guy."" I will see him later, at the 9:30 club in DC.-Fran K Washington, DC"
2,Worst Charlie's album,"If you are not the type of person who needs to own the entire back catalog of the bands you are into then you can pass on this record. UAUO see's the Charlatans at their least funkiest and most uninspiring era of their career. With the exception of the chosen singles (Forever and Impossible) both which are up to par with previous efforts, this album is boring, and when I read reviews that say this is the Charlatans most mature record I agree, but who...wants mature in their Rock n' Roll. The Charlatans have also proven that they should never try and produce their own record again. It is good to know that they will be using Danny Saber for their upcoming album."
4,Great overlooked album,"I got into this band after Tellin Stories, and this record is the best thing I've heard them do. Impossible and The Blonde Waltz are brilliant, mid-60s Dylan-inspired tracks."
1,Only for the desperate...,I was looking for a tape to coach me in speaking more clearly. This tape never even delves into the art of speaking. It seems to be designed for people who have been so traumatized by childhood events that they cannot even open their mouths. The few activities that were not songs (songs which take up over 50% of the running time) were quite silly and unhelpful. I am annoyed and disappointed.
1,Welds broke with little stress,"Do not purchase this item. I placed a 200lb partially assembled table saw on this mobile base. I wanted the table saw on the mobile base before the saw got too heavy to move easily. 2 welds on the back wheel supports promptly broke. Inspection of the welds showed they were very poorly done. In addition, one of the springs on the front supports broke. I have not even had this mobile base more than a couple days and now I have to try and get my money back."
2,Time simply too valuable!!,"Well, I just got thru assembling the HTC 3000and it took over four hours. Lousy instructionmanual, not clear at all on the sequence ofassembly; had to unbolt it a number of timesin order to get it to fit correctly becauseof the way the wheels have to be bolted on.The next one, IF there is a NEXT one, shouldbe a lot easier to assemble since I now knowwhat to allow for in advance. I can say thishowever,it does appear to do the job quite welland with the free S&H; and ESPECIALLY it beingMADE IN THE USA !!!!!!! Kudos for that HTC !!"
1,Not suitable for heavy equipment--,"This HTC 3000 ""heavy duty"" mobile base is supposedly rated for 700 pounds, but I mounted my Grizzly 10"" cabinet saw (less than 500 pounds) on it and, after moving it less than a half dozen times, one of the casters has completely disintegrated and a second one is coming apart. And this is on an absolutely smooth concrete floor. I tried without success to find a manufacturers number/contact to complain with no luck. Fine if you have a light-weight piece of equipment, but don't try putting anything near the ""700 lb. capacity."""
4,Quiet & cool,"I needed something to cool a wireless router that ran on the warm side. I adapted the SpotCool to blow on the router and it does a great job. The router now runs really cool and the fan, at low speed, is very quiet and uses minimal power."
2,Problems with the pivoting fan and articulation arm,"I did not find the arm to be of sufficient strength to allow the fan to be placed where I wanted it to be placed. When a motherboard is placed vertically (as probably 99% of 'enthusiast' PCs are built) it'd seem natural to either secure this type of fan to a motherboard standoff or to one of your slots. Unfortunately, this means the fan's arm is fighting gravity when you're trying to place it...and the arm is just plain not strong enough to do this.Also, maybe this was just my fan, but even though the fan itself can pivot in the circular structure, mine kept popping loose constantly.Now, if you secure your fan to the bottom of your case as shown in some pictures here this might be the product for you. But...don't count too much on the arm being strong enough to allow the fan to be optimally placed if you use a motherboard standoff or a slot screw."
5,Great Story!,"Princess Yasaman had been blessed with rapturous beauty, fierce intelligence, and an innocent sensuality that captivated two formidable men-her scheming half brother, Salim, and her loving husband, Price Jamal. But her days of bliss and nights of steamy passion were shattered when Jamal was murdered, and Yasaman fled to England and the court of James I. Calling herself Jasmine, there she would be reunited with her gloriously beautiful mother, Velvet, and her grandmother, the legendary Skye O'Malley de Marisco. I loved this 6th novel in the O'Malley series. The only thing that disappointed me was how Velvet turned out. She was always my favorite character and the fact that Jasmine favored Skye more than her upset me. But that was just my biased opinion because I really loved This Heart of Mine, Velvet's story."
2,Confusing!,"Hasn't anyone else caught that the product described and labeled is not the one pictures? I don't know about anybody else but air-tight kitchen storage containers look nothing like a timer, nor vice versa, so far as I'm concerned.I think somebody screwed up their coding and just hasn't caught it yet."
3,"You say we're fatally flawed, well I'm easily bored","Certainly not one of Robbie's best songs, and I wasn't keen on it at first, but it's definitely a grower. Give it a chance. Taken from his Escapology album, this was written about Robbie's ex, Nicole Appleton - now with Robbie's ""arch-rival"" Liam Gallagher, who it the father of her child. It also came out when the Appletons released their biography, that Nicole aborted Robbie's baby while in the now split girl group, All Saints. Well, this is probably Robbie's retailiation. There's a lot of hurt in this song, and along with the title of this review, another great line is ""I hope you blow away"". Robbie manages to joke aboout this song, as I've seen him performing it live, but its obvious he's carrying a lot of hurt, and lets it out during this song. If you hear this song, and don't initially like it, keep listening. Believe me, it is a grower."
4,book vs. notes,"I read the book Uncle Tom's Cabin before I ordered the notes. I wanted to make sure I had the most detailed context I could for an assignment. The story is written with a very Christian viewpoint. The cliff notes are very thorough in pointing this out. Uncle Tom is looked at as Jesus due to his non-violent reactions to cruelty and hate. Stowe ""preaches"" to the people through her story to take a stand and end slavery. She seems equally upset with the Northerners as she is with the Southerners. The notes condense all of the different storylines into something more manageable. There are many people in the book and it can get very confusing. However, the notes were a great help in keeping them all separate."
4,you need the STUNT MONKEY!,"This is a major upgrade over the celophane parachute toys you dropped off the deck when you were a kid. Bigger, stronger funner!"
5,EXCELLENTE EN!,"Zinz ve hhv les 20 cd zhere, vwe like tem al. Dis be gud c vrity elans muse. Fr a snowy dae, dis gud zong. Al here trie gt along, but 0 luck @ al/et fite constant. Ve neede coff syrps: Starla Paris Mid-Point Bay NWS/NWS LA Antarctica 00000-0001"
2,High shipping cost!!,"I bought one of these without looking at the shipping cost - $7.65, for an item that weighs about an ounce!! Your total price will be $17.64. It's a nice cover, but.... Maybe you should lower that shipping charge, J-life??"
5,The Making of a Leader,Excellent reading and very informative. This book is packed with knowledge and the skills it takes to become a Christian Leader in today's time; also reminding us how leadership has evolved from yesterday.The Making Of A Leader
4,some inaccuracies,"this is a very attractive map with a lot of information on it. my six year old granddaughter liked it although she required some help to finish it. it does have some inaccuracies,however. the equator is too far south, the tropic of cancer is too far south and the tropic of capricorn is too far north."
3,"Dated material, but still good concepts","The copy I have is over 15 years old and many sources appear to no longer exist. Nonetheless, the ideas and concepts of the Natural House are still good--it is an early green living guide."
3,Thermometer is really big,This thermometer is 12 inches long and really not useful for much more than a turkey or something as big as a turkey. I bought it thinking I could use it for smaller amounts of oil but that didn't work. I returned it.
5,Very Good!,Works just as advertised. I needed to calibrate it first then fried some chicken. The chicken came out nice and crispy.
5,Works well and easy to control position.,These are a must for controling deep frying processes. Not too long and not too short so it fits a variety of cooking pans.
1,Not the Original Artists,"I was disappointed when I received this CD and put it in the CD player... Midnight at the Oasis is the first song, and didn't sound at all like the original recording. Most of the songs after that were similar... obviously not the original recordings and/or artists. Although the imposters sounded pretty good and I DO like these songs, it is a little ""hokey"" to say the least. I'm glad I only spent six bucks!"
4,Je suis d'accord avec Robbie,"Je suis d'accord avec Robbie. Elle chante et parle en mme temps. C'est honteux!!! Tu ne crois pas?? Haha. Oui mon nom est québécois, mais mon nom est canadien aussi!!! Vive le Canada et à la prochaine fois...Jean-Francois Jacques Pierre Tremblay"
5,Brilliant read.,Very entertaining. Gives insight into the life of Socrates in small segments. Highlights of the book for me were descriptions of the temperance and fortitude of Socrates. I would also recommend this for anyone considering joining the military.
3,It's ok,"I have to always have the latest technology so I spent my money on Vista. It's a pretty decent o/s, except not a whole lot has changed. If you're switching because you want all the new eye candy, you're better off switching to a linux distro like ubuntu and using xgl/compiz and beryl or just buying a mac."
2,Can't get it to work,"I ordered one (and happen to be in San Antonio as well), and I can't get the thing to work! I have tried a couple different times and cannot get cookies out. I tried it once with store purchased dough (which the directions say is a perfect for use in) and once by making the included recipe. I'm in the process of trying to return.I gave it 2 stars, because the concept it neat, and it has a lot of accessories. 2 different barrel size and I think 25/26 different cookie disks."
1,Didn't work,I ordered the product and paid more to have it shipped immediatley so I could use it with my children for the holidays. It never worked still sitting in the box. We never were able to make cookies and I am very diappointed.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Nice idea, especially with two barrel sizes, but it simply doesn't work. Very little power, and the pusher does not push down evenly. It kind of wobbles down, which means the dough is not dispersed evenly. I ended up returning this."
1,Doesn't include the plug in transformer,"When ordering, be aware the book light does not include a plug in line and must use batteries only. No one seems to know where you can buy the plug in. Batteries only last 10to 15 hours.Ira NeimarkIranee@verizon.net"
2,Phorm Light is not the quality it once was,"I have a black version of this light that I bought several years ago, and two silver versions that I bought last year. The older light is a great light and is everything that the advocates say below. The newer models, however, have what I consider to be a significant problem with the switch. They often do not turn on right away and, in difference to the experience one user states below, the on-off-on technique does not help. When the lights do not turn on right away, the only thing to do is wait for up to a minute before they work. Some users may not consider this sporadic delay a problem. For me, it is the difference between two stars and five."
3,Not comprehensive,"Unions Square is a good documentary of the homeless heroin addict, but does not provide a comprehensive picture of what it's like to be addicted to opiates. Most are polysubstance abusers. Most are employed. Most have not completely burned their bridges with their families and society. I was looking for a documentary that showed a comprehensive picture of addiction rather than the bottom of the barrel. I also hoped to see some suburban and rural addicts. Union Square was good for what it was, but I was disappointed that the focus was so narrow."
3,waiting,"okay, william, darling, you've had your ""court and spark"" and it's poignant and we bought it and we play it because we've been there. come on sweetheart, you got more, show me you got more."
5,Clear and concise,"As I already speak Swedish I wanted this grammar book to make comparisons because I am about to learn Norwegian. I'm most of the way through the book. So far it's clear and concise and makes sense. If this had been my first attempt at learning a Scandinavian language, I probably wouldn't start by devouring a grammar book. It was just that it came before the other books I had ordered."
2,Broke in less than 2 months.,"I only used this thermometer a handful of times during the two months that it was functional, and it did a perfectly good job. I liked the fact that it was adjustable so that I could calibrate it when necessary. The last time I used it, I took a reading, set it down on the counter, and when I picked it up again the stem (and thus the needle) spun freely. The problem isn't with the nut that is normally used for calibrations, so it appears to be something that can't be fixed."
1,Absolute Self-Important CRAP,Extremely verbose and pretentious. Mr. Johnson should give up trying to impress us with his vocabulary or better yet give up writing completely.It rates one star only because Amazon won't allow negative numbers.Don't waste your money girls!
1,Not a rewarding read,"This book has no redeeming quality, and I believe that the author shows no potential for anything other than self promotion and the furtherance of his own self-adoration. I think it is telling that this book is riddled with errors, typos, poor construction (of both plot and sentence structure), and looked-up-in-a-thesaurus language. It reveals the actual level of quality of the author and his art. If anyone reads (or purchases) a second of this author's novels after being forewarned by the poor quality of this one, they are fools."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I bought this UPS after switching from a Mac laptop to an iMac and being frustrated because my power flickers often. Each flicker, of course, rudely shut off my wonderful new computer. This device allows me to shut down my computer politely and only when I want to!If the power is off for a prolonged period, the Mac's built-in software handles the shut down."
2,Something is missing...,This read got stagnant at times. He doesn't go full circle with his idea or at least it isn't expressed thoroughly in this book. I was looking forward to more interesting stories.
1,It is easier to wade through molasses...,"... with your hands tied behind your back and your ankles in shackles. ... I had such high hopes for this book and it turned out to be pointless drivel. The examples were repetitious and irrelevant. This would have made a decent magazine article, most certainly not book material!"
2,Not for Hatchbacks!,"Everyone has reviewed it fairly well...not perfect, but does the trick. Same material as those little stickers you get on new sunglasses or xmas decals for windows.However, will not adhere to any window that has a rake or inclination. In other words, the hatch back rear window on our Prius is too much at an angle and the film continually falls off. Tried the soapy water trick,taping it up over night, etc. On the side back doors...no problem, stays in place.Maybe the heat in Vegas is too much. Also, very difficult to get bubbles out. They should put better instructions or warnings on box."
2,Face palm,"I tried and failed and now it's sitting in the closet accumulating dust. Oh yeah, I also wasted money on an installation kit, too!"
1,Total waste of time.,Product is a total waste of time.Doesn't hold on at all to the window - after less then a week the few pieces that did hold on were falling off.Doesn't stick to the surface.Even harder to put on during day time because the film become hot and stretchy and once it cools down at dusk it shrinks.Save yourself the time and money.
1,Item not as said in the description,"The description says, ""In various degrees of darkness."" How is one long roll of 5% VLT film ""various degrees of darkness?"" I thought there would be some sheets light enough to use on my car, but I wouldn't put something this dark on any of my car windows. I'm going to have to use it in my home windows in the summertime. Very misleading marketing information."
2,OK map - but lacks detail,"The map is OK for a general overview of roads in Germany; however, detail is lacking. The best option is to purchase a Germany map that is specific to an area, such as Bavaria, that will show ALL the roads for the area you are traveling in. This map was most useful when used to confirm that my rental car GPS system was pointing me in the correct direction.Probably the best option is to use this map as a backup before leaving the USA and then buy a map at a local Esso (truck stop) when in country - one that will provide better details of roads, towns."
5,Nice affordable scale for Weight Watcher needs,"I have been using this for over a month now to support my Weight Watchers program. It's easy to use and easy to read and shows either grams or ounces. It is accurate, reliable, and quick for my needs."
5,no problems,We had no problems with the merchandise. It came quickly and was exactly what I ordered. Would recommend this seller
1,Not happy.,"The item still hasnt shown up. I have checked the tracking.. and it finishes tracking sometime around the end of November.This was supposed to be a christmas present, and never showed up. I normally love Amazon as things arrive on time.. I'm not happy about this."
3,NOT SURE,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THE VIDEO BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION, DID JOE HUMPHREYS COME OUT WITH HIS OWN LINE OF MERCHANDISE, WE HAVE A FISHING REEL WITH HUMPHREY NAME ON IT, NOT SURE IF IT IS OLD OR NOT, WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS REEL"
3,LOVE AIN'T SUPPOSE TO HURT 2,"I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED, IT WAS GOOD (NOT FANTASTIC) BUT GOOD, IT DROVE ME CRAZY WHEN THEY FUZZED OUT THE NAMES ON THE SHOPPING BAGS THAT WAS DISTRACTING WHY WOULDN'T THEY JUST USE PLAIN BAGS IF IT WAS AN ISSUE."
3,Love Aint Suppose to Hurt II,This play was so-so. I didn't really enjoy it as much as the first one. The product from the seller was right on mark but again the play was an average production... very few laughs.
1,Don't buy this release!,"This is an old release, now superceeded by the Varese Sarabande release which includes the complete score AND a short suite from ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes"". All this and much better notes and remastering."
5,Cool Chick Flick!!!,Punky Brrewster fans will love this film! Soliel Moon Frye is so hot! A funny and touching coming of age story about two college roommates who are complete opposties. It's a story about friendship and figuring out who you are and where you want to go in life. I bought this for my 20 year old sis in college and she loved it! I thought it was well directed too. I think this is the director's first film. Well done!!
3,"A nice, quick read!","I give it 3 stars!!This is a re-print from 1992. The cover has been updated. And a yummy cover it is.Cute and simple love story. Didn't take long to read. Sandra Chastain does a good job of letting you get to know the characters on their little road trip/contest.Because it was written in the early nineties, it was harder to get into but it was still an okay read. The heroine is an innocent and the hero is a decent guy. It shouldn't take you long to read the book.**ARC from Loveswept, The Random House Publishing Group via Netgalley for an honest opinion**"
2,Disappointing,"The sensor on this instant-read thermometer is halfway up the shaft, nowhere near the tip. For smaller pieces being checked, it's unusable without shoving the shaft all the way through and halfway out the other side.I'll look for a better one and probably pretty much retire this one except for the rare occasions when I cook large roasts and such."
3,Didn't meet expectations,"I don't think this is what anybody would expect from the Paris we knew and loved on AI. With the exception of the last 2 tracks (now that's more like it!), overall I think the music is just okay and/or mediocre. I can do without the ""Princess P"" as well."
1,disappointed.,"Paris auditioned for American Idol singing ""Dixie Chicks - Cowboy Take Me Away"" and ""Billie Holiday - Take Five"". Throughout the competition, you saw how eclectic Paris's range of music was, and this album did not showcase any of that. I understand that smaller record companies don't give the artist as much freedom with the songs they're going to produce for their album, but Paris displayed great maturity during the show and I was hoping that would've carried into this album.I'm extremely disappointed. Sadly, Kevin Covais sounded better than her on the track they did together. And aren't there enough people out there singing about how 'hot' they are?"
5,Actually it IS good.,"Paris has SUCH a great voice. Against what appears to be the mainstream opinion about this album I really like it! Some really catchy, rhythmic tunes here. My favorite songs are ""Get Bizzee"", ""Ordinary Love"". ""Dreamin'"" and ""Daddy"". Dismiss this cd at your own risk. Give the songs a few spins. I think you'll end up liking it. Although I see Paris going in a jazzier direction I do NOT think she should give up the youthful, energetic side of music. She rocks too hard for that."
1,Terrible,"This book manages to efficiently and masterfully destroy any shred of interest and enthusiasm that a student may have for the subject of mathematical probability and statistics. I took a probability and statistics class where the teacher was in no way useful to me. As such, I was forced to rely on this book. I quickly gave up on attempting to obtain even a marginal understanding of the subject and resorted to blindly memorizing formulas and theorems in the hopes that I could deceive the grader into thinking that I was actually competent with the material. I ended up doing well in the class, but despised every moment spent working towards that goal. This book would probably be useful as a reference for somebody already familiar with the subject, or looking to brush up on the material. However, I cannot, in good faith, recommend this book to anybody attempting to learn this subject."
3,"It is ok, but ...","This is an OK book but too expensive for what it is. I learned a lot from the book. The excercises are good but the wording is sometimes confusing. You have the answers for ""odd"" exercises in the back of the book, but it looks like that the authors added new exercises in this edition and the answers are in the back of the book, therefore, you don't know if you got the right answer.You better read some other Basic Statistic book, before you using this book. Good for people that study Science or Engineering."
5,Need the DVD,"Outstanding movie with more accomplished actors and actresses than Gone With the Wind! Heartwarming! Some language, but actually it adds comic relief. You'll have to see it!"
1,screw joey smoke crack,getting dissed by 50 another weak rapper and gay unit boy the rap game is lame these days lean back remix with eminem talking about a gun is stupid everybody knows eminem's not a killer and mase is back with his hippocrite ass screw him too can't stand mase or weak ass remy ma the lil kim clone joe lost it when pun died.
2,not too good..,"this is his worst album, he has made much better albums than this. you can tell that fat joe went commercial on this album, he should slow down on his own albums and let terror squad do solo projects"
1,is he serious,"Is this guy serious? He is a freakin female. Why would the record company allow him to put this crap out better yet why would he allow himself to put this crap out. It's horrible there is only one good song the lean back remix because it has mase, eminem, and it's produced by lil jon. Don't buy this crap. It's unbelievable this guy is actually a rapper well I wouldn't even consider him a rapper."
1,instead of all or nothing lets just call it nothing!,this album is so weak in evverytihng man he is a 900000 pound person trying to rap saying hes black and using curses like the n word. the track he dissed 50 on was so horrible his whole cd is worible and so is his music. yeah ill give him props for makin it big after pun died but this album is just gonna send this sumo wrestler to an early retirement. if i was yall i wouldnt buy this album or even look at it its hard to look at him already he look like a meatball i give this a nothing not even a two thumbs down i just give this album nothing id rather buy the whole terror squad album then this girl cd
2,he must have found Pun's rhyme book,"fat joe's gone completely commercial man. he's lyrics are alright but his aim is way off. hope he sells some units to rest his soul, cuz i know it bothers him to be such a pop culture rapper."
2,Should have been called Almost Nothing,"Fat Joe is a decent rapper but this album is overly commercialized and tedious. The only good songs on here are So Much More, Both of the Temptation songs, My Fofo, Lean Back remix, and Does Anybody Know. The rest is just garbage. I'm not the one to criticize commericial rap because I enjoy a lot of it and understand why rappers make commericial songs to appeal to a bigger audience but this was over doing it. There are only 3 or 4 hardcore tracks on here while the rest is just party and booty music. It's almost as if he intended to release half the album as singles. He's almost as bad as Nelly and I hope his next album will be less commerical and more hardcore."
1,"Fat Joke:All or Nothing?I'll go with ""Nothing"" at all!!!!","People don't buy this album!Yes we do want ""So Much More"" but not from Fat Hoe!Fat Joe should take his fat A$$ back to Puerto Rico!!!He should get,get,get it goin' back to where he came from and leave hip hop alone along with those other motha F**kin' wannabe blacks!!!Oh and by the way,what the F**k is a FO Fo Fo!!!!??????!!!!!"
4,Its a thermometer... works well,Works well to monitor the temperature in my fridge and freezer. We aren't obsessive about it but we make sure we keep them at the right temperature in the summer and winter. No sense in over cooling either area and under cooling wouldn't be smart either.
2,Stopped working after a week,"I like the design of this thermometer. I like that it is easy to read and that it goes to -40F. However, mine stopped working after a week in my chest freezer. The freezer is obviously working (food is frozen), but this thermometer says the temperature is 60F :/ For $7 I'm not too upset, but I'll try another manufacturer."
2,what happened?,"in her new album ""something dangerous"" it seems natacha atlas is cornforming to what is popular. i felt maybe her record company told her to change her style to make it more ""hip"". the pop sound doesnt suit her. her voice is capable of beautiful sounds and this is not heard in the bland ,all beat songs of her new album."
4,Great Album!,"This album has a little for everyone. It fuses many different styles and sounds. First you have Natach's voice floating in with a nice orchestral sound as if it were straight out of a love story in "" Adam's Lullaby"". There is a hindi track, ""Jannaman"" which is Bollywood all the way. Also the hard club dance song "" Daymalhum"" which is fierce. The rest of the album is mixed in with hip hop or R&b sounds. The Jamacacn song "" Eye of the Duck"" is one for any reggae fans. The rest of the album is somewhat soulfull R&B with some soft rap mixed in with Natachas Arabic vocal. It is very nice to hear her voice mixed in with such variety of music styles. It works very nicely and is a great listen. It is meant to appeal to a wider audieance, especially in the west. I think some songs could even be given a chance at American radio. Go pick this one up because you won't be dissapointed."
1,CDN TR3 timer on a rope,"I do not recommend this timer at all! I would have rated it with no stars if that had been an option. It does not work as per directions. Small, cheap plastic; ""controls"" are too small for a man's hands even if they worked! Cost more in shipping and return fees than the timer itself."
1,Our second CDN thermometer FAILURE.,"After about a year of use, our first CDN digital probe thermometer model DTTC started to give inconsistent temperature readings and we felt the user interface was overly complicated, so we purchased this model. This model has a very simple user interface that we found easy to use. We were very pleased the first three times we used it, however on the fourth use it TOTALLY FAILED IN TWO SEPERATE WAYS:1) It beeped at an indicated 175 degrees instead of the 140 degrees it was set to.2) When we took the roast out of the oven, we used a traditional meat thermometer to determine the actual temp was 120 degrees not 175 degrees.We will not be purchasing another CDN brand thermometer."
3,re: Sub-fence,"The Sub-fence itself is square. It's held in place by 2 large dowel pins. A set-screw hold it in place. The dowel pins have some about an 1/8"" play in them so when you tighten down the set screw, the Sub-fence is not square to the other left side fence and blade. So and easy fix is I bought these thin brass strips about 1/2"" wide by 12"" and comes in different thicknesses. I just cut some strips and put them in the dowel pin hole and sub-fence is square now. I've seen many reviews on Hitachi miter saws being damaged in shipping process. I bought the Hitachi C10FSH 10-Inch Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Laser and the box packaging seemed pretty strong, so I took some pictures for everyone to see on Flickr: (...)"
1,A Serious Let Down,"I own the previous 3 volumes of Angel Beach and love them. But this bizarre compilation sounds like a wanna-be ""Buddha Bar"" that fails miserably. Some top 40 crap, be warned, don't waste your money. The Best of the Series; Angel Beach 1, the first."
3,Has effective exercises but is a pretty outdated version.,"Has some good moves and good advice, but I am pretty sure you should just save your $$$ and check your local library for one in the freebie discarded pile. This thing was so old that the models in it were wearing those outdated exercises outfits that surpassed your bellybutton by 3 inches and rode up ur hindend. I'm pretty sure that when my mom was 17, this was the book that her gym class used (and shes in her 50s!). So, if you are just wanting to know some of the classic exercise moves then this book is pretty good. Just don't expect to have a great updated fitness book."
4,Rather doco,"This work is rather doco of contemporary young Americans, their first adult experiments and expertice, plans and dreams.It is interesting especially to teens outside the USA."
3,it didn't do much for me,"I was hoping better results, but I didn't noticed any big differences, my skin gets very dry and nothing seemed to work, but I got a different one and it worked a lot better, I threw this one away almost full"
2,Court?,"The album is a bit noisy.. I'd have to say that I am not really a fan of the guys' voice. and I would like to point out is blue's secret dream to be a lawyer? First all rise, now guilty... both has to do with 'testify(ing)' and 'all rise' to the judge etc...Most of the songs sounds the same. You get bored after a while"
4,good for the animals,"i would rate this as a decent blade...they don't do animal testing which Gillette does. for that, an extra star. it works for a decent shave"
3,KOTC Review,"This dvd seems better put together than the ealier KOTC dvds. There are some good fights, early fight from Joe Stevenson is very good, some familar faces from previous KOTC dvds."
3,Very long and monotonous,"I will say this is a sweat inducing and challenging workout which is refreshing. There are a few way too easy prenatal workouts out there.However, the workout is long and in my opinion does not give an adequate warm up. I got bored with the three sets of just a few exercises. She also offers very few modifications which I find especially troublesome with the abdominal section which is done entirely flat on your back.She also does not always do the same number of reps or the same pace on each side of the body. I get a 45 second stretch on one arm while she babbles away and only 15 seconds on the other.The short version is also about 45 minutes if you include the core work and the stretch which should be included in every workout. I don't find that very motivating for a day when I am really pressed for time. I prefer my quick workouts to be complete with a warm up and cool down in under 30 minutes."
5,economical magazine storage and organizer,"Although these files are not elegant, they are sturdy and easy to assemble, take up only little space until assembled,Bankers Box(R) Low-Cost Fiberboard Magazine File, 11 3/4""H x 4""W x 9 1/4""Dand provide a cheap way to organize and store stacks of magazines or other printed material such as catalogs."
4,Buying madness,"I am a retired professor of mathematics. When I retired I got rid of my library and now I am back to rebuying many of the books I rid myself of, including the current one under review. Hilton and Stammbach's book is quite useful to learn homology from. (I'm not an expert in homology although I have published research in homology,) I prefer MacLane's Homology if it can be found."
2,"use and throw, for sprains use something else.","My intention for using this was to prevent my fingers from twisting and spraining during volleyball. These dont help much in that regard, I'm going to try taping my fingers together (lots of guides on youtube). Another issue is these seem to disintegrate pretty soon. I dont see them lasting more than 6-7 uses. The only good thing is they seem to remain tight as long as they last."
1,boring,"I really don't like this soap operaish anime. Nothing exciting happens. I liked Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha a lot better than this one, although they are all done by the same author. I prefer more of a fantasy or an adventure setting . Real life events really suck big time."
1,Breville does not back their products,"After very little use, this product stopped working totally. Williams Sonoma NO longer backs their products unconditionally (stopped trading there) so when I contacted Breville regarding their barely used product, they would not back it either. They offered to sell me a new one! I have several Breville items, but will no longer buy their products!"
1,An amazing record makes a poor CD,"Funkadelic's Free Your Mind... is a landmark of American music -- and is an album which George Clinton says they recorded in a single afternoon. Some of this shows in the rough edges, but that's part of its charm and genius. Unfortunately, the mastering on this CD version is terrible and you'll find yourself listening to long stretches where no sound is coming out of your speakers. Until Westbound issues digitally remastered versions of the Funkadelic catalogue, buy the record."
5,a bit confused,"i read part 6 before i read part 1 and i was confused. where can i buy the first, second and third comc books of this sereies? ifyou know of any good websites, please contact me at JRBPoy@AOL.com"
5,THE BOMB!!,"The best anime book i ever read!! A must buy for Tenchi fans!!I`m big on anime,& this is the best out of 10 shows!!GET IT!!"
4,Very Entertaining Manga.,"I ordered the first couple of these graphic novels because I was fond of the Tenchi Muyo! OVA series. The comic picks up where the OVA left off (so, you might want to watch the OVA before you read them).While some of the material may not be suitable for young children, it is very entertaining. Hitoshi Okuda strikes a perfect balance between action and humor. I'm looking forward to reading more."
2,Nanny goes to the devil,"Juliette Mills was a tv hit in Nanny and the Professor, in this film she is more in need of Nanny 911. Mills vomits green bile, curses and gives husband Richard Johnson a bad time. It is a cheap coupling of Rosemary's Baby and the Exorcist and is worth a view for a laugh."
3,Finally...legitimate DVD release,"A veritable staple of the CBS LATE MOVIE in the early 80s, this ersatz Exorcist used to give me the willies when I was a kid (and as I had a thing for Julliette Mills, I wanted to give her the willie...but seeing her spew vomit and give birth to ol' hornhead's kid pretty much cured me of that). Great to see this finally get a legitimate release, after suffering through some perfectly awful boots over the years...."
1,MY EYES!,"This product is so horrible because when I play with the mobile monitor, the screen is bad. It makes me get a headache. I think it's one of the most horrible products around."
1,"Great idea, cheaply materials.","Bought one before Christmas, hinge was broken when I took it out of the box. Went to the store to exchange, ended up opening 2 brand new shriked wrapped box and they were the same."
2,Not loud enough,"Bought this for my mother who is hard of hearing. Package says ""Loud Alarm Timer"". While it seems to work fine, she couldn't hear it as well as our $5 kitchen timer. We we gave her ours and will keep this one. Loud is a relative term. If you are looking for a timer that is louder than the rest, this isn't the one."
5,I just love it,"Excellent product since its package, it is not the typical cheap product. it has all the required instructions and aids to help you have the job done (double sided tape, connectors, etc) your job will look as if a pro did it! It really looks as if it comes with the mirrors!"
1,Marilyn is missing with Lauren,"Have yet to receive this item, 11 days after order placed. Post office at fault?"
1,Uninteresting characters and not about food.,"What a disappointment. First, I never managed to finish this book, since I found it uninteresting and boring, especially when it came to characters and descriptions of the surroundings. So I never got to the second part when the sisters come back to the bakery. Regardless, this book is really not about food per se. Sorry, can't recommend this book more highly. The references to Chocolate and Like Water for Chocolate on the front are not fair - this book's quality is far below those books."
1,Another Formula Driven Track,"another cliched track.typical Dissin"" Factor then you get another by the dime dozen Vocal performance.we shall see Where She is in another couple years?I see a One Hit wonder at Best."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it would have more information about how to understand msg and it's labels. It had a lot of recipes which I didn't need. I know how to cook without msg. It was mostly other websites to go to for information - not giving you information. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,very disappointed,there is some good information in here but it isn't worth the price I paid for it - as others have said it is mostly recipes and most of them are nothing special just the author's family recipes it appears$7-$10 would have been a lot more reasonable for this book
2,Just OK,"I was disappointed in the abbreviated fashion that the book was written in. Of course my opinion was probably affected by the fact that I just finished reading ""Fatal Traps for Helicopter Pilots"" which was just the opposite!"
1,Game boy advance looks better than this thing,"I came home in much anticipation to breaking open my new portable screen for my game cube and the anticipation turned to disappointment after about 5 minutes of using this screen. The size of the screen didn't bother me, but suffice it to say....the best games on the game boy advance look better than the best games available for the game cube on this thing...that's how bad it is. The video is horrendous. The colors are totally washed out. The brightness control does virtually nothing to help it. The backlighting has horrible inconsistancy thoughout the entire screen, especially around the edges where it practically turns white. The car adapter is a nice idea and I was surprised to see that you could hook it up to all the other available systems on the market but with such poor video quality your better off waiting for something else."
1,Interact just doesn't match Intec's standards.,"This monitor had terrible picture quality. It blurs like crazy. What's worse is that it came with a broken hinge. So I returned this. Later I found out Intec made a monitor (for the same price). So I ordered that one. Here is what I discovered:Intec Pros:-High resolution screen (produces clear image) (Even better than a regular TV)-Light so that it does not pull the GameCube back when you are playing it-Wonderful sound (much clearer than Interact's)-Two outlets for earphones-Built in battery-High refresh rateIntec Cons:-Smaller screen than Interact's (5"" vs 5.4"")Interact Pros:-Bigger screen than Intecs (5.4"" vs 5"")-Good sound (not quite as good as Intec's though)Interact Cons:-Low resolution screen (Blurry)-Extremely low refresh rate-Heavy-One outlet for earphones-Must purchase separate battery"
1,Good Idea-Bad Design,"I Got one of these screens and I was really excited! Only, that when I opened the box... The hinge fell off, then when I hooked it up, there were lines through the screen. I found out at the place I bought the screen 70% of the screens are defective. I the tried out Intec's Product and found it to be much better, even though the screen is a little bit smaller. On a scale from one to 10 I would give this screen-1."
1,"5"" mobile monitor","I think the 5"" mobile monitor for gamecube stinks because the screen is way to small"
4,"Very well insulated, but not very flexible","I bake at high heat (550F) and have not felt any heat through this mitt. It's very well insulated and plush. Also, the grippy texture is an added bonus. The only issue is flexibility, but I suppose it's difficult to engineer an oven mitt that insulates very well and also has enough flexibility to move the thumb to the pinky finger."
1,too thin -- you'll burn yourself,"The Calphalon oven mitt is long, which is nice, but it's too thin to protect your fingers when holding a hot roasting pan or cookie sheet. The All-Clad mitt is far more useful."
4,Very good and they clean up well,These are really good gloves. The silicone on mitt really helps hold the hot pan and keep it from slipping. They wash up well in the laundry.Only issue is the large are still a little tight on my hands so if you large hands (as I do) you might find them snug
4,Lens Cap Keeper,"One of 2 brands that I bought. Both do the job but for larger SLR lennses, it is a tight fit around the barrel but still usable. Recommended though especially if you don't want to lose your lens caps and risk exposing your large and very expensive lenses and filters like Kaesemann until you get a replacement."
1,Good price ...but postage & mailing defeats 'on-line' ordering,the cap keeper is OK..no problem so far.. I should not have ordered it 'on-line' ...Paid more for P&H.;These are available in local photo stores at the same price. Check local stores before you order for it. you will save P&H..; The item as supplied is Ok for '3 stars' but on the whole I giveonly '1 star'
4,Good but wish the attachment cord was stronger,So far this has been a good product and has kept the cap attached to the camera. The only thing I would like to see is a stronger cord. I also placed a drop of super glue on the part that attaches to the cap itself in hopes that it will stay on. The problem I had with my previous keeper was that the button came off after several uses and I almost lost my cap. I would strongly suggest a drop of super glue as reinforcement.
5,Works Perfect for my Rebel XTi.,"I bought this because I misplaced my lens cap and had to replace it. I'm not willing to pay for another lens cap, so I bought this to avoid losing it again!It works as described. I'd say the attachment string is a bit on the short side, so if you have a really long lens, this might not work very well."
2,Lasted a couple months until I dropped my lens cap into a river,"The product worked well for the first few weeks, until the adhesive wore off and it fell off. Fine, no big deal. I super glued the thing back onto the lens cap. Made the mistake to not superglue both sides. When taking photos over a river the adhesive decided to fail once again dropping my poor lens cap into the river. But really in the end you're paying less than three dollars for this thing. Expect a three dollar product."
3,its okay,"we like it but, we can't use it. i dont want to stick on my lens cap yet. but in the future is useful.thanks"
5,Are you till sticking your lens cap in your pocket??,"Easy to use, peace of mind, one less thing to worry about not loosing. Now I can focus on my shooting than worrying about the cap, where I put it. This is my second one. With the hood or not works with both of my 18-135mm, 50mm lenses on Nikon D60.I have to tell youa very funny story. So I got this 50mm from a pro second hand on craigslist. I went to his place, he has all this equipment and I take out my camera and it has the 18-135 on it with the lens keeper. I am totally amazed with all he has and he goes crazy on my lens keeper and asked me where I got it!! there I was looking at all that he has he is all over my cheap lens keeper!! it was soo funny. It gave me the idea that he needed this:))"
3,Pretty owl,"This is a very attractive bird, however I don't really think it is for kids. It's not quite as soft for cuddling and there are a few pieces that feel stiff."
2,NOT ENOUGH POWER TO DO THE JOB,I PLACED THIS PRODUCT UNDER MY EXO TERRA TERRARIUM BUT WITH ONLY 8 WATTS OF POWER IT DID NOT HELP DRY OUT THE SUBSTRATE IN THE TERRARIUM SO I AM BUYING THE EXO TERRA DESERT HEAT WAVE IN A LARGER SIZE WHICH IS 25 WATTS AND AM SURE IT WILL DO THE JOB AS I HAVE USED THEM IN THE PAST.
5,I thoroughly love this CD!,"I've listened to SOLAR VOICES over and over again and feel like I've entered a landscape filled with numerous layers and textures that one viewing will not satisfy.So many songs from other CDs get worn immediately, so it was refreshing to hear something new each time through this CD. Though reminiscent of Queensryche (vocals) and Rush (instrumentals), Inner Resonance still has its own voice and power. I suggest you take a stroll through this landscape. I guarantee you'll stay a while."
5,Excellent Book on the Entire European-Theater of WWII,"This book gives an outstanding overview of all aspects of the war in Europe. Those elements combined into modern ""total war"" of unprecedented destruction and suffering, and tens of millions of deaths.For a single-volume book on the European-theater, it's hard to beat. Required reading for students of World War II."
4,SMUG debut CD,"some great songs on this CD...'eventually' is great, 'the saint' kicks my a** and 'today' sounds like an oasis track...sounds a little like lit and everclear too...also you can hear the old kiss influence...watch these guys when they play in NYC"
5,It works and it was a bargain,"I can see no difference in performance between this card and one costing two or more times as much. We use it in a camera, and with 2 gigs, it holds many days worth of pictures."
1,A DISAPPOINTING RELEASE.,"The producers took original material and ""souped it up"" to fit the eighties. In the process they ruined the originals. Results: overblown, multi-slick, surupy sounds. All of the songs are available on other Patsy Cline cds. Buy them-do not buy this recording. Not good!"
5,A like a hot knife through butter,"Gillette screwed up in thinking more blades equal a smoother shave. After a hot shower, or during a hot shower, I'll lather my beard, mustache, and goatee to edge and shave - I rarely cut myself or even see razor burn. These blades (with this vendor specifically) are the cheapest I've seen anywhere online or in stores. I'm going to try to make it a point to order a set or two with each Amazon order from now on."
5,can't beat wool for warmth,"Good product slow service...small company just be patient with them, worth the wait. It is a warm barrier against the cold wind when walking the dog. Priced right."
3,so so..quality,Sound quality is not good and the singing voice is not pleasant to listen to. Content is ok. My child do pick up a few words from it.
3,Requires two hands,"I like the timer's functionality and features. The beep is loud enough to be heard several rooms away. But if you mount the timer on a vertical metal surface using the magnet -- such as a refrigerator -- it is not stable. The magnet is small, so when you push on a button, the timer rocks to the side and sometimes falls off. The only way to turn off the beep is to hold the timer with one hand and push the button with an other. Very inconvenient while cooking."
2,"Good Functionality, Lousy Design","This is a fine timer with one significant design flaw that makes a positive review difficult.The back of the timer is not even; this means that, if you use the magnet on the back to stick it to your refrigerator, you can't press the start or stop buttons without knocking it off the refrigerator."
4,"Good timer, not cat-proof",This is an excellent timer and I am about to buy my second model. It withstood being knocked to the floor by my bad cats several times before becoming seriously unreliable. Easy to use.
3,"Good, but missing something...","Kennedy's book has many flaws, which the author himself concededs in the opening chapter. One of them is that the book is very Eurocentric, his analysis of Asia is both weak and often times, somewhat inaccurate. He lumps together so many events at times that the reader is given a false image of what the actual events were. Also, the idea that the world is just a clash between great powers loses the fact that many different individual leaders have shaped what goes on in many of these conflicts. As a survey of history, Kennedy does a good job covering a large period, but in dealing with such a huge length of time, he loses out some of the importance and only shows what is obvious, not touching on smaller, below the surface things and marginalizing the majority of the world, those that aren't ""great powers""."
3,"History doesn't Change, Only the Names do!","Simply put I felt Kennedy's work was an in depth perspective, using historical evidence to support the adage, ""How the Rise and Fall of Empires and People don't change, only the names and places do. You could write the same analogy 1000 years from now, and be in the black. But for those who need to wonder and reference on where we came from, how we got here, and where we are probably headed, Kennedy augments the paradigm of our species,ie.,the struggle for power, how to achieve it, keep it, and squander it. Put another way,the mechanics and dynamics of Machivelli's Prince, is as applicable today, as it was in 1513. Good reference material for doing an historical analysis. Robert"
4,Top class history writing,"As an A-Level student studying Europe in the years of 1789-1914 this book not only gave me a wider knowledge of my course, but also an understanding of history's implications on the world as it is today and tomorrow."
2,Not so instant read...,"This was my free item on a Buy 4 get one free promo that Amazon is running at the moment, or I would have sent it back (probably should have anyway). It really isn't ""instant"" read as it takes several seconds. Also, mine came with a dead battery so I had to replace that up front. My last instant read, which I lost, also shut off automatically, which was a great feature that this item does not have, for about the same money."
2,PL 105 Seat,"I bought the PL 105 exercise bike for my mother's birthday. She is quite pleased except for the extremely hard seat (it is very uncomfortable)Been searching for source to purchase cushioned seat cover. Sent several emails on your website. No response. Why is it so hard to get information on an accessory that I'm fairly certain many people would need to cope with a tough, unflexible seat?J. F."
1,Buyer Beware,"Just a warning to those who like me assume sertain basic features on an item, for instance the ability to adjust the tension on a stationary bike. Thats right, cant be done on this model. Its like peddeling down hill and no way to creat more resistance. I know its my fault for not reading the fine print, but the last bike cost $40 less and it had a knob. Definitly not worth the $130 I paid for it."
5,The best of a marvelous band.,"Simply put, this album is wonderful. Having many of Buffalo Tom's albums, I can attest to just how great the track lineup is. It's hard to find an album that I enjoy all the way through, but this one has done it.Janovitz and company have a wonderful sound, similar to that adopted by Third Eye Blind in more recent years, but not limited to it.My favorites are ""Summer,"" ""Sodajerk,"" ""Kitchen Door,"" And Tangerine. However, not a single track on her is weak in my opinion, a true rarity for collections.By. Listen. Love. And come back for more. You will not be sorry."
4,Great for Candy,"I have found that this is a much better thermometer to be using for candy and such, as digital is so accurate and you cannot read it incorrectly. With a regular bulb type thermometer, one tends to read at an angle, thus getting a false or inaccurate reading.My only problem is that when I am setting the temp, it seems to only go up by odd numbers, ie 237, when I am wanting 236 or 238. I don't know if I have a defective unit or what. Otherwise, the audible signal is awesome. Set a few degrees below what you really want, and then watch. If I set it exactly where I want it, it seems to go higher before I am able to react, thus I exceed the temp I want.I would have given a 5 star, except for what I have stated above, I am unable to do so,."
4,"Great Stories, Great Pictures","This book has plenty of stories and plenty of photographs of pretty girls. My only disappointment is that there aren't more photos, but that's always the case with pretty girls. You always want more."
3,One Thumb Halfway Up,"I share Steve Sullivan's fascination for glamour girls, but was rather disappointed in the women he selected for this book. Virginia Bell was singularly unattractive and has been justifiably forgotten; Cynthia Myers was an overrated and depraved doxy, ideal for the usually vulgar Hugh Hefner and the always vulgar Russ Meyers; Sabrina was, at best, a third-tier entertainer; and I've never understood why Sheree North was considered even remotely attractive. The book is saved, at least to some degree, by the chapters on more interesting women -- e.g., Yvette Vickers.Sullivan's criteria for his selection is a mystery. To be sure, there are glamorous women other than Monroe and Mansfield worth writing about, and they can be from the second tier, such as Sue Ane Langdon. But why focus on what amounts to the bottom of the barrel? A pity."
4,The Kitchen Coordinator,"This timer does everything that it is meant to do. It is the perfect kitchen companion, especially during the holidays when you have several things cooking or baking simultaneously. My only complaint is that I wish it were a little bit louder. My kitchen gets so chaotic and loud when it is filled with guests, it is sometimes difficult to hear the timer when you are entertaining. When I am flying solo in the kitchen or with a normal volume crowd, it is just fine."
3,volume of the beep,I have used this brand of timer for 30 or more years. The volume of this new timer is very low. I cannot hear it in the next room. It is not loud enough to wake me from a nap when it is beside my head. I use one of my old timers-same brand-(which has a louder beep) to time my nap.You might wish to buy a different brand of timer.
4,Wonderful but delicate,"As DON'T DROP mentioned, this timer is very delicate. I've had 3 of these timers over the years because I absolutely love the 4 event timers -- I set them to the most important times (10min, 15min, 30min, 45min). However, they don't take to be dropped, and I drop things due to poor hand control (find that it can survive 2 drops, but never a 3rd). But I do keep coming back to it and ordering another. Just wish they had a shock proof cover for the timer or made it sturdier. I would gladly give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the dropping problem."
2,Too Small,"The image of this item is misleading. The timer is tiny (as is the screen), about half that of my old West Bend timer. Also, although this one has 4 timers, there is a lot of fiddling about as you have to 'program' each one in turn. I spend my time flicking the slide-switch just to get to different timers!The slide-switch feels wobbly and not very secure. I suspect it will soon break with the constant usage. I'd have preferred a larger screen and a louder alarm. Looks like I'll have to find another West Bend somewhere as the screen was large and the alarm quite loud.This item is also considerably overpriced for what it is. There are cheaper/beter products for the money."
4,"A coming out party for the ""original"" Ohio Players!","Of the Ohio Players recordings on the Westbound label, Pain represents a new direction in soul music of the early 70's - a coming out party for the original Ohio Players led by Junie Morrison. That the title cut, ""Pain"", was ad libbed is a clear indication of genius at work. The first few notes of the bass on the title cut, Pain, got everybody up on the floor over 25 years ago and for the ""old school"" crowd, still does today. Although much of the phrasing, both lyrically and musically is repetitious throughout the different cuts, Pain, a fusion of jazz, funk, and R&B is a must have for the true funk collector."
2,"Sleek design, good sound, comfortable BUT battery lasts only minutes","We chose this phone due to its sleek and attractive design. But beauty does not run deep. The battery has been changed several times and the phone insists on dying-- even when the battery is fully charged. Looks can be deceiving. Unfortunately, this is just not a good headset for any kind of prolonged use. Not recommended."
2,Less than average Nielsen,"The series by Schonwandt seems to include some worthwhile performances, but these are far from the best. The relative simplicity and clarity of Symphony No. 1, for instance, is marred by a heavy-handed and overinterpreted performance, lacking in rhythmic and textural clarity."
5,Shippuden always a yes,"Amazing, loved the DVD case and DVDs work fine. Defiantly a recommendation for you to buy it. case was a little worn out but amazing none the less!"
4,"Good Stretch of Anime in this box set, buy online for sure",Starts out with Oroachimaru Versus Ninetails Naruto and continues until they meet up with Sasuke. In my Opinion the manga based part of the anime gets good after this box set. There are fillers right after this and this box set ends the opening non filler part of the anime. I bought the first four box sets online than went to digital only after this. Didn't want to watch or buy the fillers. You can buy 13 episodes worth on Zune marketplace via Xbox Live for about 26$.
5,Ergonomic office accessory,"Do you put your feet up while you're working? Tuck your feet in your chair, prop them on the desk, smash the piles of books by resting on them? This footrest gives you the same comfort with better back support and a more professional appearance.This footrest is made of charcoal steel, with a black non-slip pad which keeps your high heels from sliding and is also comfortable if you work barefoot. It will look good in your office, fitting with the rest of the furniture and decor so you don't end up looking like you've put your comfort before office standards. It's simple and sturdy and comes fully assembled.Once you begin using it, you'll be glad to find that it adjusts easily -- you can just push it with your feet into the height and angle that you prefer -- no need to get up and take a screwdriver to it. You'll be comfortable without being distracted by it.Your office mates will want to steal it, though, so keep an eye on it when you don't have your feet on it."
5,"please, no quibbles with this monument of genius...","How can the reviews below quibble, the little quibblers?! Supposed technical deficiencies in the recording have never marred my enjoyment and respect for this record because I WAS LISTENING TO THE MUSIC. So there. Ignore the obsessive engineer types and buy this incredible invention."
3,"Tasty, but","It does taste good, but like others, I had an issue with the packaging. The bag and label have no nutritional data--at all. I'm on a diet and one of my kids has food allergies. So I'm guessing at the calorie content, and won't give any to my licorice-loving son because I don't know exactly what's in it. I have no data on where it was made or packaged. You have to be ridiculously trusting to start eating. But it looked good, so I tried it. The taste is what I was looking for, but without ingredients or caloric info, I won't be buying this again."
1,This is not Kookaburra brand licorice,"This is sweetgourmet.com branded licorice, not Kookaburra brand. Buyer beware. Very misleading advertising. It was fulfilled by Amazon, so I am even more disappointed."
5,Blendtec Blender,"This is a terrific product - and it fits under my cabinets!I especially like it for blending whole food juices and for making ice cream. The only down-side is that the motor is loud, so wear ear protection. I purchased one for myself and one for my daughter."
2,Meh,"In the 2 weeks I owned the Blendtec, 3 frustrations led me to exchange for a comparably priced Vitamix. 1) It's really really loud 2) Cavitation (air pockets) 3) Display. To expand: I believe there are some best practices to avoid ""air pocket effect"", it just seems like an oversight that the blender has a top with an opening, yet no tamper. I hate dealing with 'proprietary' menus in electronics - it reminded me of an older cell phone VCR, or a comcast remote - scroll, scroll, back, up, down - not user enjoyable. While it may blend well enough (if the conditions are right) there was enough about the blender which made me regret buying it. Also, the pitcher seemed a bit thin and brittle - the square design made it awkward to pour and clean. I'd recommend looking at a Vitamix instead, less gimmicky and more pleasant and quiet to use."
1,serious blendtec accident,"i've had my blender for 5 months now and up until today, this would have been a 12 star rating.today, i tried to blend soup, as i do almost every other week with the blender. today though, when i poured the hot soup into the blender and placed the pitcher where it was supposed to be, the pitcher popped, the thing that you pull over the blender flew back and boiling chicken stock and carrots that felt like they were heated in satan's layer splashed all over my body. i have burn marks all over my body: stomach, arms, legs and even on the right side of my face. i do want to point out the fact that i was of no fault: no where does it say that i am not to use the blender for hot liquids and everything was put in order, nothing was misplaced, the cap was put on properly and the hood thingy was shut."
5,Big motor = big yummie smoothies,"We make a lot of smoothies at our house. Our Kitchenaid couldn't handle the frozen fruit and after a while plastic pieces in the mechanism broke. After reading other reviews we splurged on this Blendtec. Love it!!!! The smoothie setting is perfect, and the countdown timer helps the kids to stay patient. Much easier to clean, too. The light plastic pitcher is a lot nicer to work with than my old heavy glass one. It is expensive, but it's worth it!"
5,Amazing blender - don't replace your juicer though...,"We saw the demo at Costco and were impressed. Yes, it's loud but so is any blender! It has amazing power and we use it daily for ""green smoothies."" Our normal blender couldn't chop up the greens effectively. It's super convenient and cleans up very easily -- a key feature for me.One of the pitches was that this can also replace your juicer, but not so fast. The apple juice we made was largely froth so we'll stick to our juicer for juice, and this for everything else. Recommended."
4,Wonderful product,"I love this blender! I have been using it pretty much every day & my only problem with it is the Noise! It is darn loud. My husband keeps telling me I'd better not turn it on before 8am or the neighbors will be complaining. I do have to plug my ears when it starts to wind up. But.... aside from that, I did take one person's advice & did not attempt to turn it on until I read the instructions. Found that this was a good idea. I've made smoothies, cocktails, green shakes, salad dressing, soup. I keep browsing the nice recipe book that came with it for more ideas. I haven't actually heated soup in it yet because I usually make a very large batch, but I do use it to puree items for the soups. I am concerned that the little plastic insert in the lid with the prongs that fit into the lid might easily break. I'm very careful with it."
1,Dangerously loud,"We bought a new Blendtec in 2010. It failed after 18 months. It took Blendtec about a month to repair it under warranty. My wife thinks the blender works well. I am concerned about its noise level, which may be as high as 102 decibels. That's LOUD! In a work setting, such as a factory, the operator of that blender would be required to wear ear protection. The volume and kind of noise may be dangerous to one's hearing. Next time, we'll buy a quiet blender."
3,More variety,I would have liked more variety for the money. It is highly likely you'll need many track packs.
5,Good enhancement for the train set,"I cannot really speak for my 3-yr old son, but from what I can tell, we have been having a lot more fun after having this additional set.Well, I am usually the only person putting the imagination and creativity. However, I started seeing the interests from my son, and he started putting things together as a pretty good ""co-engineer"". Not only for this set, the whole Geotrax stuff is good and recommended.The price for this set is reasonable, but some others are a bit expensive..."
2,Robin hood vs Peter Pan?,"I ordered a Peter Pan Costume, as advertised, for my 10 year old daughter. I received a Robin Hood costume.The quality of the fabric was poor, though it fit well and we made it look cute with a toy sword. We pulled it off, and also had a Tinker Bell and Wendy in our group, so it worked out fine, but overall, not what I expected."
3,"Good Idea, bad execution","We usually really like OXO products, which is why we purchased a cutting board from them. The board is almost everything you'd expect an OXO product to be. It's non skid and set up so it doesn't rock while you cut. It also has a very clever channel on one of the sides to keep liquid from running onto your counter. The only complaint we had about the cutting board was that our knife cut huge grooves into the board material on the first use. Not only does this make it very difficult to scrape up food once you've cut it, but it also leaves the board susceptible to bacteria. I would have expected the board to be a lot more durable and not be so easily scratched up. Even cheap boards we have purchased lasted longer than this board did."
1,Where are the databases,"My problem with this book is that the sample CD does not have the Database files required to make the examples work. The Adventure Works file was moved, but is still available. The rs2005sbsDW database does not seem to exist anymore. These are small Databases, and there is only 600mb free on the CD. I bought the CD version of this book so I wouldn't have to hunt the web for the answers."
2,Didn't have the will the read on...,"I got this at the library, reading the summary, back cover, and the first page. I thought I would give it a try, because I liked the plot; it was interesting and held my interest. However, when I got back home and started reading it, I put it down. It didn't meet the my expectations. I was bored, didn't understand the characters (the 2nd guy wasn't even introduced...he barged in and with no background), and I thought her story within the story was bad. The humor was blunt; I didn't laugh once. Partially, I went for this too because of the humor. I write it, I read it, and I want to enjoy it.This book disappointed me. It could have been better, but it wasn't. Don't be misleaded by the summary."
2,"Not a total flop, but darned near it!","I was really excited when I picked this book up at a discount book store. I had read the back cover and was intriqued by the premise of the storyline. I went home and quickly sat down with a nice cup of coffee and started reading. The story was great, the characters lovable, there was mystery, humor, and a wonderful sense that this book had a lot to offer. Boy was I mistaken.After introducing all the characters and the fun of 2 book characters suddenly showing up in the authors living room, there were about 30 pages of fun while the characters become accustomed to our century's way of life, the story just became bogged down. The problem was the story just kept repeating the same stuff, over and over. It got so boring I wanted to throw the book in the trash, but was already commited to finishing it. The ending didn't get any better.While not a complete waste of time, I wouldn't recommend this book if you have something else to read."
1,Slow and Tedious,"This book makes you slog through 124 pages of tedious ""Regency"" prose before the plot even starts. There is more attention paid to lame editorializing about the publishing industry, than there is to the book that is being written. If the author wants to write a murder mystery, then why does it take so long for the murder to occur? I got stuck reading this book on a 12 hour airline flight. What a dreary time! Instead of reading a book full of mystery and romance, I instead read lame jokes about romantic heroes acting like they were gay. (???) You can tell that the author is totally out of ideas to write about, because the lack of enthusiasm shows. The jokes aren't funny, the romance is non-existant, and the mystery plot is a total non-starter. I do not recommend this book to anybody."
5,Outstanding,"I don't understand where some of the reviews below are coming from. These guys are aren't meant to sound tight or precise. They are a total Rock n' Roll free for all. This CD has so much energy to it that it almost melts your speakers. And don't believe the hype""? These guys should get MORE hype. They are under-rated if anything. If you like ACDC or Rose Tattoo mixed with a little Punk, you will love this CD. Both Tight Bros CD's rock harder than anything out that there that is part of the new rock n' roll trend."
5,Trains,"Great set, I just wish they would package the bridges in quantity. They get used up quickly when you go up in levels"
2,production can't carry them.,"after seeing the plan live last night, my opinion of the cd and of the band itself dropped 10 fold. live, they were sophomoric, completely schizophrenic, and not tight AT ALL. the singing was embarrassing, and the on-stage presence was fraught with pre-pubescent energy, as if the plan wanted to be sex-symbols but didn't know where (or how) it stick it in. the overall production of 'emergency' is what makes the album even worth 2 stars, but i truly can't respect a band that can't carry it's music off in a live venue."
5,The D-Plan Rocks Me Like a Hurricane,"So the guy that gave it a one star review, only had the album for two days. This record (like a lot of great records) is a slow grower, it takes repeated listens to really enjoy. I remember the first time i listened to lonesome crowded west by the mouse, I felt ill. I didn't have a place in my brain for the sounds i was hearing. This record is sort of like that, in that it is tough to understand on the first spin.Anywho, Emergency and I is a great album. Just repeat to yourself, ""I must listen to this record 9 times before formulating an opinion or i will get syphilis."" and you will be fine"
1,trying,"I have had RCA learning universal remotes and given them as gifts,all to my satisfaction. THEN I got this one. It will NOT learn Motorola HD cable box, nor combine volume control on audio equipment with TV controls.Whereas my components are not in the factory library, there is snome behind the scenes tie-in that prevents mixing equipmet. My old Memorex CP8 (ca. 1988) does all this well."
2,a little tiny,"They are a little on the small side.If the glasses were a little wider from hinge to hinge they would be great.Otherwise they are good spares, or for a little purse or in the pocket."
2,Not Orchid,"The notebooks themselves are fine and will function for what I wanted, but I should have paid attention to the reviews because the paper inside is not even close to orchid in color--it is grayish blue. Will not be ordering again. Only reason I gave the product 2 stars is because product is usable and was shipped on time."
1,Hose=cancer,"If your looking for a strong hose-this is it,with one BIG draw back...YOUR HEALTH!!! On the inside of the label for the hose reads ""WARNING This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING""Now go fill up your kids pool,and water your vegies with it..I think NOT!!!!!!!"
5,Joyful Jamal,"Received the CD today and played it ""cover to cover"" (something I rarely do). Must back up everything our friend from Texas said. This is superb joyful music and, containing as it does two different sessions, offers great variety. Recording quality is first class making me realise how much we missed when we had to rely on vinyl."
5,this must be it.,well i guess this is the chord book with a cd which includes the riffs and backing guitars.
4,Good Supplement for Organic Chemistry,"I have both the Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, and the Second Semester topics addition. I find both very useful tools for understanding OCHEM. The first semester book has useful nomenclature section, which is not covered at all in the second addition. I think a nomenclature section for the benzene section, and to show how Carboxylic Acid and other carbonyls are named and numbered would be helpful practice, although some of it may be review. However, the explanations for benzene ring mechanisms and modificaton is indispensable. This series of books are only supplements, and cannot replace the text, or lecture because there are topics not covered in the ""language"" books, and some reactions that are included in the Second Semester book may not be required in a specific course. You can not go wrong by investing in these books and working the practice problems."
3,It's okay,"I think there are better universal remotes out there, we only got this one because we've used it before."
3,"Grace Walk, Text vs Workbook",I want the text book but accidentally ordered the study guide and the work book...I can't seem to find a regular text.
5,Grace Walk Explains that it's not Works but Faith that leads to Salvation,"This is an excellent book that describes how it's not how many times you go to church, how often you help out in the soup kitchen, whether you go door to door spreading the gospel and being a ""good Christrian"" that everyone else should look up to or compare themselves to you that guarantees your place in Heaven. It's your faith in Christ and that he is the Son of God and that he died for your sins on the Cross at Calvary that counts. It's Grace not works ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"". Give this book to your friend who likes to show off what a great ""Christian"" she/he is; hopefully it will humble them."
3,Good Movie,I found this to be very informative in reference to the childhood relationship that Devdas and Parvati had as children. It was also set in a realistic environment and answered questions that the up to date Devdas doesn't.
5,chris lowney,"Simon has pulled off a rare feat with with his splendid book, ""Beyond Technique in Family Therapy."" This highly respected family therapist writes in a way that even those with little or no professional background in the field can comprehend. He's equally insightful--and equally lucid--in his fascinating presentation of key philosophical themes.I believe that his book is aimed primarily at therapists or those still studying to enter the field, but the book will have appeal to a wide range of others: generalists who want to learn a bit more about philosophy, family therapy, and their interplay; those interested in western philosophy who want to learn how it affects this important field; those who are in (or who have been in) therapy who want to step back and reflect on the therapuetic process. An all-around triumph that deserves to find a wide audience."
4,Good Deal,"Geat value thank you for a great deal ,good deal and will buy again from this seller and amazon sellers ."
4,A great story,"This book's plot twist has been used countless times in TV today. I read this story a while ago, and you learn to never go hunting with a man who says he wants the most dangerous game.SPOILER: The reference is to hunting humans. It shows a man's quest for survival being the hunted animal among me. It shows what will happen when a man is faced with a life-or-death situation."
1,Terrible Editing,"The Kindle version of this book is a disaster. The text sometimes ends mid-sentence, then the next page starts in the middle of another sentence...WHERE DID THE MISSING TEXT GO??rip-off..."
5,Battle With Jine Kurogasa!,"I really enjoyed reading this novel. It finishes off the battle between Kenshin and Sanosuke, moves on to the creepy arrival of the assasin Jine Kurogasa, and ends with the introduction of Takane Megumi. Nobuhiro Watsuki pulls off more good script and illustations that include intense bloody battles, moving scenes, and comical antics that make it so popular. No other graphic novel really interested me as much until I read ""Rorouni Kenshin"", number one, because the show rocks, and two, I was familiar with the characters and plot. Now I've moved on to buying the other volumes, which are just as good."
4,Light & Tasty,"Certainly not the epitome of scholarship, this book is very enjoyable on a peruser's level. A fun & interesting survey of the more outrageous & eclectic homes in the west, primarilly California. The houses at Malibu alone will put you in mind of a sci-fi set design."
2,Don't 'Come On Over',"'Dull' is the word. Outside of the title track and ""Jolene"" there's not much electricity to be found here. Album was a moderate hit at the time thanks to its nice packaging. Despite a long list of yawners, there's still ""Don't Throw it All Away,"" a catchy, mellow tune that would have made a good single at that time."
2,"Specifications, not Nostalgia","If you're looking for a trip down memory lane this book is not the choice. I was expecting a coffee table book with pictures of vintage snowmobiles. Instead, it is repackaged period shop manuals. That's great if you own a vintage sled and need to know specs, it's probably invaluable for that purpose. There is no description for the book, so my fault for assuming (or hoping) it would have color period pictures - which it does not."
2,A nice read but nothing new,"I bought this book because Tim Sanders, author of ""Love is the Killer App"" recommended it. I wanted to like this book but I'm sorry to say there's nothing new in it. Save your money for the next Seth Godin book."
5,Pink Elephant,"If this book was not so thououghly researched and footnoted a reader might suspect the author's intentions. If one thinks that the pedophelia scandal has gone away or that simply a few bad priests that slipped through the cracks into the priesthood, buy the book! Remember that 85% of the victims were young males! Of course, the priests who victimized these boys were homosexuals! And, you might ask why bishops protected them! Within the ranks of the clergy lives a pink elephant and this beast is protected by a lavender mafia. If you are curious as to the orientation of the clergy, buy the book. You'll be shocked."
4,Very interesting documentary for fans,"Well, I have just bought this DVD and I am quite happy with it. The fact is that there is not much stuff available about Montgomery Clift nowadays. Therefore, having the possibility of viewing and listening to his friends and family is really thrilling for me. I had previously seen another documentary on this actor and I have to admit that this one by Biography Channel is somehow more factual and less intimate. There are fewer details about personal experiences and anecdotes (maybe because it is more recent). Despite, this DVD contains various interesting features: pictures that I had not seen before, some voice records of telephone talks, etc. In short, I definetely recommend this product to any person interested in knowing about this great actor."
1,sony fan,"I also had trouble with the CD stopping in the middle of songs and not starting again. Also, sometimes, it wouldn't even start the CD. This happened and I exchanged the unit for another and it happened on the second unit as well. The digital tuning on the radio was terrible, too. I bought a Sony Psyc with an analog radio and I love it. Way better than this RCA which was more expensive than the Sony."
1,20 roll of poor quality paper,"I purchased the roll of Scotts 20 bathroom tissue, 1000 sheets, and was very disappointed to find that the quality is not the same as the smaller packages. The smaller packages of 12 and 6 have much softer paper than the roll of 20. The roll of 20 is very rough and feels like dryer sheets. It is definitely not a bargain. We are being ripped off!"
5,Superb script and story,"This episode shines as one of, if not the best episode of the entire series. Balancing assassination attempts with ultra-powerful secret weapons, 'Mirror, Mirror' turns on an axis of pure action and suspense. There is not a second or a scene in which something is not happening. Nimoy's acting is most notably brilliant in this episode, creating a darker undercurrent that is present throughout the episode. Nichelle Nichols also shines in her scenes as Uhura, displaying the character's spirit and resourcefulness as never before. This will be one of the ones you watch over and over."
5,Big thumbs up,"I am an avid reader of true crime novels. It took me a while to get around to this title but I'm so glad I did. We may have the next Ann Rule here. Ms. Davis told the story with heartfelt empathy, kept us focused but didn't denigrate into a judgmental attitude toward Ms. Routier or her family. I just ordered Ms. Davis's first book ""Stalked"" from Amazon because I enjoyed this one so much. Can't wait to get started on it."
5,Great book!,"After her father dies, Marilee sails from England to Jamestown, Virginia, where her brother and his wife live. But her brother's wife is bitter and nasty. Then her brother dies in a Indian attack, one of the men Marilee loves marries her brother's widow, another sails to England, and Marilee must decided if the one left is the one she truly loves."
2,Better off saving up for a better elliptical...,"This machine is really cheap, mostly plastic, and very loud. I can only use it when I'm home alone, because the noise it makes is unnerving to anyone who is around. It serves it's purpose, I get my heart pumping, and wearing headphones it's not toooo bad, but you still hear it. The levels of resistance are a joke; I have to keep it on the highest level of resistance to feel any effect. Not worth the money. If there was a way to return it I would have, and saved for a better machine. We have spend more time trying to figure out how to get rid of the noise than we have using it. My boyfriend Nick has a worse time on it, because the machine shifts side to side under his weight (he's only 150lbs...). I would not reccomend this machine. We will continue to try to fix the noise, and if we figure out how I will post it here for anyone who might find it helpful.~Tiffany"
4,it's a pretty good cd,"At first listen, it sounds like they're trying to do too many styles at once. But after a few more listens you come to realize that this amalgam of styles actually brings one unified and memorable character out of the band. Musicianship is definitely in the high ranks and these guys (specially the guitarist) really get the sound to go with the style. Inevitable criticism would be that eventhough some songs are pretty catchy (like ...Hotel Mexico) some songs just don't leave anyimpressions. Maybe they need some catchier tunes and they'll find more success perhaps.."
2,Not exactly what I expected...,"Ok, maybe I just didn't read into the product enough, but I thought they would be push to turn on lights. There is a magnet, and I really can't figure out a good way to use the magnet... how make it work with a cabinet, because the light and magnet need to touch, and it just wouldn't work. It does put off a good amount of light, I'll give you that. But I find it impractical, and I would not have bought it if I knew how it would work."
2,Didn't Work,"Three of the lights would not turn off with the magnets. Luckily, I only had five drawers that needed lights.I would have chosen to purchase other lights."
2,"So Long, Simpsons! I'll miss you!","This season wasn't quite as dull as season 11, but still I did fall asleep while watching disc one! The show seems to be rehashing the same old same old. the episodes were only mildly amusing, I couldn't picture myself watching any of these episodes again. I actually returned the set and got my money back! This is my last purchase of any of the Simpsons' sets; I'll stick with the sets I have (1-10)"
3,The official start of the major downfall of the Simpsons :(,"There had been some decline in the quality of the episodes starting in season 9, but after I bought this and watched all the episodes...I realized this was the season in which I started to not enjoy the Simpsons nearly as much as the other seasons. I am a die hard season 2-11 Simpsons fan and could not live without those box sets but the others are hit and miss at best. It was a sad day after I finished the episodes and realized it was the last Simpsons box I would buy and that I needed to resell this set before it lost any value. The start of the smug Simpsons where there are environmentalist themes and an increase in (sigh) unfunny Lisa episodes."
5,GREAT SELLER,"Shipping came much faster than expected, Great condition of product, 100% accurate description and a very good price. Great seller, and I will definitely look at their products first before anyone else's."
4,Beginner's Guide to Bats,Thought this was a good reference book. Would have liked a little more information in each catigory.
4,"Good, but perhaps something for a time capsule","This is a comprehensive, well-researched, and lavishly illustrated guide to Oriental carpet design. Despite this, the book is actually rather limited in its coverage: the vast majority of the rugs the author describes are from the mid-20th century. Therefore, ""Oriental Carpet Design"" may somewhat disappoint serious collectors, and will provide novices a surfeit of information on rugs from a very specific time in history. As an alternative, while it focuses on 19th century, museum-quality rugs which are beyond the reach of most of us, I think Murray Eiland's ""Oriental Carpets: A Complete Guide"" remains the best single volume on the subject."
5,Beutiful and sweet baby doll,My 3 yr old granddaughter loves lila and plays with her every time she visits us.She makes soft pleasant little sounds and has never been at allannoying like other toys she has. Unfortunately our dog chewed the pacifier and it won't fit into the doll's mouth anymore. Any suggestionsas to where I might get another one or a similar one that works.Aside from that it is so wonderful to see how much my granddaughter enjoysher new baby.
4,What are they saying?,"Nesbitt has magically arranged and explicated the often tiresome writings of post-modernists, finally bringing students and interested architects a sense of where they are in the scope of things. Nice book, though not as a attractive as Hays' similar anthologies."
2,Not happy with this book,"I bought this book for my girls and its a waste, no detailed instruction on how to make stuff. I did find the advice for being a princess cute though."
4,"Not approved by Lovecraft, but funny anyway!","I bought this book because i thought it was funny something so horrific as the book of the dead should get remade in plush. When i revieced it I was not let down. Just don't regard it as a book, but rather as a funny twist on the stories and the legends about the necronomicon. If you'd like to read that one, you'd be much better off checking out some websites related to the mythos of Lovecraft.Lastly my kids think it's a fun book, and that's without any knowledge of Ctulhu and such. They think it's just cute. So i'd say Lovecraft would NOT approve, but never mind that."
4,Dance shoes,"These shoes are fine quality. They are VERY narrow and small. When ordering, order a size up, for sure! If your foot is the least bit wide, order a size up in wide. I don't know what scale they used to create these, but they are ridiculously small and narrow."
4,order a size larger,I am normally a 7 so i ordered an 8 and yes these shoes are pretty slippery but you can buy stickers that you can put at the bottom of the shoe! i love them and think they were a very good price
1,Runs a full size too small,Nice looking square dancing shoes. I returned them because they were a full size too small. Also the toe box is shorter than most shoes.
3,Nice looking shoe but runs small,I had to order a pair of these for my daughter for a play she is in. Normally she is between a 5 1/2 and a 6. We purchased a 6 1/2 thinking we would be ok... nope! Way too tight! We are returning the 6 1/2. After calling around we found a place about 35 minutes away that has one pair which turns out is a 7. My advice if you order these.... order 2 LARGER pairs at the same time and return the ones that don't fit since size seems to be a common issue with these shoes.
3,Shoes run a full size small,Basic dance shoe at a reasonable price. Be sure to order one full size up; I went through 4 pairs to find this out.
3,STYLE,"I like the shoe--takes time to break in so shoe begins to fit the mold of your foot, like all Capezios. Comfortable. Really bought this shoe for everyday wear, since I like taupe to elongate your leg and foot. Makes you feel like a dancer!"
4,Purchased for Daughter's School Musical,"The shoes fit and looked nice. My daughter has wide toes and narrow heels, so I was not sure if I should get wide, but the medium fit fine. (I was a bit confused by the sizing, thinking at first that M meant men's sizes and W meant women's. What happened to A,B,C, and so on for width?) The leather soles were very slippery, but I'm guessing this is how they are supposed to be. The heel had no rubber grip at the bottom, it was just the leather. Staples could be seen in the heel. My daughter is relatively new to theatre (7th grade) and I have never bought such a thing before, so I assume this heel is standard. The product was delivered promptly and looked exactly as pictured."
5,nice pair of shoes,"great pair of shoes. I bought these for my daughter for the Nutcracker and had no clue what size she would wear. I took her to a local shoe store and had her try on several dress shoes in different brands and discovered that a size 9 would work best as a street shoe. We took the advice of others and ordered one size larger than street shoes and they fit PERFECTLY. They are very comfortable and she will wear them for her musical concerts at school, church, etc. These will not just be worn for a specific performance. She loves them. The heel is perfect for a young girl."
4,character shoes,"These shoes worked great for us. My daughter has a very wide foot, and despite the man-made material, they fit her comfortably. You would have to spend a lot more to get this shoe in leather, so this was a deal."
5,Right or Wrong is a classic,"The 3rd of George Straits albums this is part of his classic music. Right or Wrong has many great songs this a classic job done. Again the reason to buy this album is not really for the hits because you can hear those on his greatest hit albums. The main attraction songs maybe 80 proof bottle of tearstopper, Our paths may never cross, and one of the best songs on the whole album maybe track 10 Fifteen years going up one night coming down, every song is listenable and its not boring at all. It has a very distinct sound like Our paths may never cross is a well written song. Unlike George Straits second album Strait from the heart which is also a great classic. I think Right or Wrong has more distinctness to it."
1,Absolutely Pets overcharged me,"I ordered a 2-pack of GlycoFlex 3 for my dogs. They sent me ONE bottle at full price. I tried to explain the problem directly to Absolutley Pets TWICE and they treated me like a moron! Amazon refunded my money. Many thanks, Amazon!"
1,NOT FOR BABIES WITH SENSITIVE SKIN,"I HAVE BEEN USING THE PAMPERS SENSITIVE SKIN WIPES WITH NO PROBLEM FOR OVER 8 MONTHS. MY HUSBAND GOT THIS HUGGIES AND MY SON DEVELOPED A DIAPER RUSH A FEW DAYS LATER OF USING THEM, I THREW OUT THE REST IN THE GARBAGE, THEY ARE VERY STRONG BUT ROUGH ON THE SKIN. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THESE FOR SENSITIVE BABY SKIN."
4,Like these wipes!,"We've used these wipes since our 18 mo old son was born. We've never had an adverse reaction on his skin, unless we've used a different brand of wipe. he was a preemie, so we originally bought these because they were good on sensitive skin. Haven't been disappointed. I was trying to find just the refills but couldn't this time. So, I ordered the 8 box. The quantity (8 boxes) is a little over the top but we reuse the boxes for all kinds of things and storage around the house."
4,Wild Women,"Diva who go really wild in the ring and out - Blood flow, body just don't, and bored stories *"
3,Low point of 70's Buffett albums,"Although I very much enjoy Buffett's albums from the 70's (especially Son of a Son, Changes, A1A, and White Sport Coat), I can't stand this album. Nearly every song is poorly written, and the sound quality is really horrible and dated sounding. If an album needed to be remixed and remastered, this would be it.Nearly every song has a weak or shady subject matter to it (a whore, sacreligous talk, cocaine-snortin', mandolins being femininine, goofy song about Cliches, etc.). You get the picture. I'm not sure what was going on in his mind at the time, but he should have known better to not release something of such low standards.The only songs that work on this are the title track and the lovely Defying Gravity (not written by Buffett)."
2,Came highly recommended but couldn't get through it,"This book was raved about by a friend, so I bought it based on that. However, I found it hard to focus on and did not finish it. For me, it droned on and repeated itself. Not to slam the author, it was just not for me, and I do function in prophecy, so it is not that I don't believe in the concept. I expected to grow a lot through the book, but put it down before I even halfway finished it."
3,Not for Apple computers. Questionable support,"I have not yet used the software because it would not load on my Mac, and the DVD drive on my PC is broken. Still waiting for the new drive to arrive before I can try it. I contacted Landairsea tech support to see if there was a way to use the software on the Mac (live chat) but gave up after waiting 20 minutes for a response. There was nothing about use on a Mac on the website so I am assuming it just isn't compatible.Field trial of the unit seems like it gets good signal anywhere in the car. It's mostly plastic (the car that is)I wouldn't have much trouble with the small screws holding the battery cover except they are right next to the magnet which is quite strong. The screws and screwdriver keep snapping over to the magnet. Wish I had a plastic screwdriver. They should provide non-magnetic screws."
2,Flat Panel Television FRAMES,Even though I love the concept of this product I have only given it two stars because the company lacks variety for frame options. Luckily for me I researched flat panel frames thoroughly before I made any purchases and I found HD Envy. www.hdenvy.comThey are a company with a HUGE selection of frames and even custom order capabilities. Plus they have a unique patented universal bracketing system that beats all the competition's strap options. I would recommend checking out www.hdenvy.com before making any purchases.
3,"Not much point, really","If there was any justification for the emergence of the ""period"" movement, it was the reinstatement of approproiate (i.e. quicker) tempi for so-called slow movements. In general, Kuijken's tempi in these movements differ in no appreciable way from those of his allegedly more uncomprehending predecessors in the traditional camp - Grumiaux, Milstein, Perlman and so on. All he lacks is their flair, with nothing to compensate. If you want a period performance, go for either Jaap Schroder on the Smithsonian label (and later Naxos) or, best of all, Lucy van Dael, (peerless on Naxos, if you can tolerate the intermittent breathing noises)"
2,Loses codes,I have owned two of these and both of them kept losing theircodes I have programmed in it after a few days and both of themhad new batteries in them.
1,Painful for most students,"We had to read this text for Prof. Friedman's Programming Languages course. It was entirely unintuitive and slow reading. I grasped very few of the concepts in the book. However, because of Friedman's curve, I got a B+ in the class, which tells me that most students were just as lost as I was."
1,What a rip off,"Based on the previous reviews I bought the book blindly. What it is , in my mind is a tiny comic book, of roughly thirty pages that goes into minimal detail. I really wish I could demand a immediate refund. I felt totally ripped off. I'm embarassed to think I got hoodwinked into buying a book just because of previous reviews. I feel the other reviews were based on friendships with the author. This book was a total rip off, I am throughly upset I purchased it , and wish I could demand a immediate refund. I don't know Amazon's policy on returning books. Jacob Charts Salt Lake City Utah"
1,Historical Fiction,"Mr. Polishchuk seems to be a man with a flare for twisting history. This book dosn't even make for ""poor"" reading of history. It leans towards one politacl agenda, ""discredit"" the fight for freedom by the Ukrainian people. Mr. Polishchuk, stay with fiction, your not bad at it. The testimony of a Ukrainian? Come now sir..."
3,The self-esteem of self-esteem,"The two-factor model of self-esteem, based on worthiness and competence, is a practical and helpful way of thinking about self-esteem. Mruk effectively demonstrates that self-esteem is more than just ""feeling good about yourself."" Also, his piece-by-piece explanation of a course in improving self-esteem through cognitive methods is very interesting and insightful.I think I would have enjoyed this book even more, though, if there were more emphasis on illustrating the results of research in the field, and less emphasis on defending the field itself from critics. The fact that I picked up the book in the first place, I would think, makes that unnecessary."
4,NOT Win98-WinMe Compatible!!!!!!,"This game continues in a similar vein to the previous MOH titles, with a few enhancements. In Pacific Assault, the player gets the chance to fly aircraft from that theater. The Director's Edition requires a DVD player and is compatible ONLY with Win2000 & WinXP. The publisher told me that they do have plans to release a Win98/Me compatible version, but they don't have a specific date as to when it will be released."
1,Selfish and spoiled,"Gig's selfish behavior really doesn't set the kind of example I want my girls to follow. I'm not sure what the Christian message is supposed to be, but whatever it is, it got buried under all the pink fluffy trappings that apparantly make Gigi a ""true princess"". If you really want a great princess book for Christian girls, check out ""the Princess and the Kiss"" by Jennie Bishop. Now there's a princess book that has it all- adventure, love, and a great message for girls everywhere. For boys I also highly recomend ""The squire and the scroll"". My 9 year old loved it and it too has a great message. Happy Reading :)"
3,somewhat disappointing,"This is a fairly standard recipe journal. In terms of quality, however, it is extremely disappointing: the material used to construct the cover and the pages in between are not sturdy and absorb moisture very easily. When you're cooking, this makes for a horrific scene. This journal was wrapped in plastic so, I didn't know. There are a few other journals out there, particularly one made by Saveur, which I would consider looking at before purchasing this one."
5,~LANCE~,Blaine wrote this song because of a great friend by the name of Lance because his parent s seemed not to support him. His girlfrien(kind of) was real good friends with blaine she convinced him to write this for Lance......We will never forget ~LANCE~10/16/1984~11/11/04
4,overall very nice,"The clock is working great, so far (I've only had it for about a month) and the appearance is a appropriate for any decor (home or office). The only complaint I have is that the same button is used to access each of the items you can get info on. It is kind of a pain to have to cycle through all the data to get to the one piece of info you truly want."
2,Good lucks but,"Bought mine a few months ago in a Macy's store, in between flights. On the night out back home, this watch stopped working. When I went to return it, the salesperson told me it must've been a battery thing... but if it's new, there shouldn't be any problem at all. The good looks, ( the few hours I was with it, called a lot of attention) are a plus but there is no use for a good looking watch if it won't keep time!!!"
2,"Looks great, sounds bad","I have a 20"" Aquos and love everything about it, so when I needed a smaller set for the kitchen I bought this one. When I hooked it up I was very disappointed with the sound system. The sound must be turned nearly all the way up to reach normal levels and then the speakers sound ""tinny"". Not even as good as a 15 year old 13"" Sony. Took it back and the retailer admitted it was the weak point of the system."
4,"Coward's lover,friend and literary executor's retrospective",I read and reviewed this book for my on-line theater magazine -- The new off-Broadway musical about Coward's friendship with Gertrude Lawrence draws much material from this book as well so I found myself referring back to it for my write-up of that show -- both show and book are particularly timely as the Coward centennial celebrations get into full swing.
2,Booooring,"I found this video incredibly boring, even on fast forward. If you are very new to exercise, it definitely explains how to balance your diet and some of the basic concepts of getting in shape and losing weight that you don't normally see. But, since I already own a few aerobics videos, I found the moves in this one to be unoriginal and boring. Step up. Step down. Plain vanilla pushups, bicep curls, and so on. I was looking for some new techniques to mix up my already existing workouts, and I definitely didn't find them here."
1,Horrible waste!,"I can't believe this is considered a ""paperback""!!! This is not a book - it is a catalogue with very little actual information about infant/child development. You would be way better off doing some research about the Montessori method online and skipping this purchase."
3,IT'S OKAY,"NOTHING NEW HERE, this is guttermouth at there not very best i love guttermouth. but, this is a joke"
2,Classic Christianity According to Bob George,"Bob George does not come in any way, close to C.S. Lewis, Deitrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King or Martin Luther in his understanding of God's will. These were people with heartfelt belief in the Lord Jesus Christ. Bob's view of christianity is Bob's view. - ""It's my way or the highway"" approach! All others' according to Bob's Gospel are not on the path of salvation. Bob needs to step back and look at the entire ""Tree"" - to embrace the salvation of all children of God. Please do not take this the wrong way Bob. Jesus loves you so do I. Bob, you need to open your eyes and your heart."
1,Another shrewd way to make a fortune....,"Looks like ol' Bob has figured out a way to stop driving to work (again). Write a book about about how EASY it is to be a christian! If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Any christian worth his salt should be ready to die trying to spread the word to the most hardened, unworthy non-believer they can find. After all, as Bob says, Jesus DIED for you - what have you ever done for him? Except, perhaps, buying a book online that tells you how to stop trying so hard. Pathetic."
5,Classic Christianity,This book has been live changing for so many people. We started a couples bible study using the book and the study guide. So far our group has give away 50 additional copies to our friends and family and the impact has been unbelievalble! Regardless of your religious background this is a must read if God is knocking at your heart.

5,The Greatest Barbarian,"Robert E. Howard seems to finally be getting his due. He was, without a doubt, one of the best fantasy writers of all time. Not only fantasy, but numerous other genres came to life under his brillant pen. Do yourself a favor and read this book. Then read all the other Conan editions. Then take a deep breath and plunge into the worlds of Solomon Kane, Bran Mak Morn, Breckenridge Ellis, El Borak, and the multitude of other supermen of the plain,mountain, and ethereal other worlds. It's a hell of a ride."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited with i got my Creative Zen Stone. Yes the charge life was horrible, but that was not much of a concern for me. I liked the fact that it was small and perfect for working out. Overall i thought it was a neat little gadget until it suddenly stopped working after 2 months. I attempted to turn it on one afternoon and the creative logo appeared on the screen and wouldn't go away. I could not access my music and the device would not turn off . I'm highly disappointed...i expected more from this company."
3,Not Bad but a little Pricey..,"I do like this body wash for the smell and the ingredients. I find it does lather up a bit when I put some on my sponge. Found it can be pretty pricey on some sites but fortunately I was able to get these body washes for under $5-$6 for each tube (including shipping and handling) and each tube lasted about 2 weeks for me when I used them so it wasn't bad. I really enjoyed using just about all of them, just wish they lasted longer while in use."
1,Does not lather! Too expensive and it uses up FAST!,"This product does not lather at all, it is VERY expensive and before you know it, the tube of soap is gone. A person has to use more than twice the amount of other liquid soaps on the market.Overall I give it one star as it is nothing special, there are lots of natural products out there that do a better job and cost way less. I would NEVER buy this product again, not a happy customer."
1,"DJ Clue without the ""DJ""","I have listened to R&B and hip hop for over 15years and this is possibly the poorest way I have heard the way word ""DJ"" be used. This album is track after track of mediocre songs with ""DJ"" Clue shouting useless shout-outs at the beginning of every track. A DJ is supposed to mix, blend tunes and think about how he/she will use the 74mins of music time - this guy clearly has little DJ skills and insists on giving hiself props on EVERY TRACK. This album pales into insignificance compared to say Fun Master Flex who IS a DJ. This album is very very disappointing unless if you like ""DJ"" Clue's other material. Listen properly to the album before you buy. Having said that, the T-Boz tune is very good, however, like all the other tracks, it is spoiled by Clue's aimless screams at the beginning. There will be people who like this album for the combination of big-star artists in that respect, it is good. But as for DJ Clue - not talented as a DJ and on the whole, quite disappointing."
4,"It's cool, but not really worth the new price","This cd, in my opinion, is mediocre. There are a few bands that sound like Consumed (Millencolin and No Use For a Name being a couple of the best) but this cd doesn't really stand out from the crowd as much as I hoped. I'm not saying the cd sucks or anything, there a few standout songs like ""Wake Up With a Smile"" which is freaking awesome, ""Chop Suicide"", ""King Kong Song"", and ""Something to Do"" which will work you up into a frenzy if you let it. Put simply, these guys are fast, driving, sort of melodic punk that is well worth a listen. I'd find it used if you can, well worth 5 or 8 bucks. Check out No Use For A Name if you like this kind of punk, they'll knock your socks off."
2,"Good idea, needs work","I can only vacuum for about 20 minutes with this brush -- exactly 2 9x5 carpets and 3 3x5 ones. The batteries need recharging too often. This makes the brush barely adequate for even a small home with wood floors. Forget any wall-to-wall carpeting. To top it all off, after 2 years of use (granted we do vacuum a few times a week, sometimes every day, because we have pets and a toddler), the pressure sensor is failing, leaving behind an expensive vacuum with no electrical hose, and therefore no option to upgrade to a better brush. Should I spend $270 on an item that only marginally works? Others seem quite happy with their less stylish Dysons for much less than that! Still, 2 stars because it does handle hardwood floors and rugs with ease, goes in tight corners and attaches to the canister (though, why not make the hose attach, rather than the brush?!)"
1,the unvanquished,very bad book. would not recommmend reading it. He just drags the story on and not very interesting.
2,Smoke but no cigar,"I bought both DVDs in this series and looked forward to learning some new molding techniques. The author covers some interesting molding techniques and since I am interested in small precision plastic parts, I found the little plastic car quite interesting, except for one thing: the author painstakingly repeats how to mix part A with part B several times during the DVD, as well as the vacuum degassing of silicone. We really only need to see this stuff once for goodness sake! And then more interesting aspects like how to decide where vent and pour holes should go is all but glossed over. There are better video guides on this subject and in fact I have found better ones on YouTube for free."
4,Bright & Colorful,Very pleased with looks & quality of product. It's about as wide as it is tall & it does stand up on its own. Very cute and colorful.
4,good book,"The author covers many areas of basic construction and gives cues for making the job easier and saving money. It is what I needed as I plan to build farm structures but why is there home plans included? The book does not give the detail necessary to attempt such structures. Speaking of the plans in the back of the book, my greatest peeve is that none of them include a materials lists."
1,This is just a fancy phonebook!,"I bought this book and while it looks nice sitting on a bookshelf, the information inside was not helpful at all. If you are looking for more than just a company name and address, don't waste your time. My local phone book had more entries for wholesalers in my local area than this book had for the whole United States. You will be better off searching trade magazines and trade related websites for information. I was so disappointed, I returned it for a refund."
3,A good read,"I think this was my favorite of this series. I say ""Think"" because I haven't read the first one yet. I actually started in the middle of the series ""The Seductive one"" and wasn't too thrilled, but since I had ordered the whole series I finished the book and went on to the 4th book; Marcelli Bride. That one got me interested in the family as a whole. So I had to read the fifth; Marcelli Princess. It was ok, but Hated, I mean hated, the Prince (I wanted to slap him silly.) and said I was through with the series. But then the 2nd one came in, (Had to order it from used books) and I had to read it. Yesterday the 1st one finally arrived.The series is worth reading, But I think you might enjoy them more if you read them in order. Sparkling One, Sassy One, Seductive One, Marcelli Bride and Marcelli Princess. OK, skip that last one. You're gonna hate the Prince."
2,I have read better,"The beginning of the book talked about philosophy and such. Interesting but boring. The physical training portion of the book was lacking. The routines are not regimented and looked like they were thrown together without any thought.The majority of techniques are simple and straight forward, but some looked unrealistic. There aren't enough illustrations either. The descriptions of footwork, stances, and combinations were unclear and could have used more pictures to illustrate them.War with Empty Hands is a self-defense book, and I don't recommend it. The author writes about his military experience and uses people wearing military fatigues in some of the pictures, so I was not sure if the author was trying to teach military combatives or basic self-defense utilizing Karate. Either way, I have read better books on both subjects."
3,First time as producer shows need for growth,"After 1984's My Kind Of Country, Reba takes more control of her career by co-producing Have I Got A Deal For You. Although the album is an excellent effort, it does show that the novice producer has excellent potential but neeeds improvements. The up-beat honky-tonk songs just don't quite seem to work, yet they are still good. However, Reba does sparkle on key ballads such as ""Red Roses (Won't Work Now)"" and ""The Great Divide"". It is on these ballads that Reba shows her growth as an artist and truly shines. All in all, a good effort, but not her best."
2,Don't waste your money,"I loved Ron's 7 Day Mindsigns Diet- a free download I found on the internet, and that's why I bought the book. I was surprised to see how little information is provided in the book- I was hoping I'd see some expansion on the ideas expresssed in the free download- and it's not true that you can color in the posters because they are SOLID black!Of course the thoughts themselves are precious and that's why I give this book 2 stars- graphically the book is just plain boring. A facelift (reset the whole book) by a PROFESSIONAL graphics person would help..."
2,DUMB,This movie never seems to get you interested. It's been done before plenty of times and those were much more watchable than this. The actors were great as always but the plot and direction of the movie were simply dumb.
3,Something Unfinished,"Giamatti and Hoffman are dead-on as political pros, acidly sharp at their work, but weighted differently with conscience and character. Their moments on screen, along with Clooney's, kindle the only fire in the film, about three stars worth. Gosling's transition from idealist to slick cynic is awkward and finally unbelievable. And as an actor he simply can't stand toe to toe with Hoffman's canny mood swings or the effortlessly human implosions that Clooney is so beautifully rendering in middle age. The storyline is pretty threadbare and sometimes seems channeled through ""Days of Our Lives."" Occasionally there is the wonderfully dark and ripening fragrance of American politics-as-usual wafting through here, but the meal never quite leaves the kitchen."
5,Great story --,"This movie will be one I will remember. It had great acting, and a believable storyline. Great drama, sheds light on the politcal scene many of us here about but never see. Not 100% believeable but it is close."
5,An accurate portrayal,"If you are looking for a serious film that accurately portrays the aggressive self-serving realities behind politics then this film is for you. This sober film stands out from others by concentrating on the inner workings of a presidential campaign and focuses on the Democrat national party. It depicts the cut throat atmosphere within a single party where cruel tactics are employed just as viciously and competitively as they would against the opposing party. If you are simply looking to be entertained and cannot deal with the moral nuances and complexity of character and morality then bypass this film, if you can handle it then Ides is for you. Ryan Gosling impressed me in The Believer's"" and is just as forceful, compelling and sexy in this role. This story works around Goslings character who learns the hard way that one mistake can derail a career forcing one to be pitiless in their methods, even if it means destroying the good and the loyal."
1,Plot is see-through,"Clooney crafts a film about the ""dark side"" of politics. Should be a shocker! No wait, it's what we expected and so poorly played."
2,Waiting for the Story to Start....and Waiting.,"I had high hopes going in. I usually like political thrillers. Alas, I kept waiting and waiting for the main storyline to appear and it never did. Huge difference between a string of events and a real story. There are hardly any surprises, conflict or anything else that creates drama and suspense. And Clooney, are you kidding me? The guy had very little screen time and just delivered stale politically correct blah-blah, in typical Clooney-esque fashion. And this warrants an Oscar nomination? I don't think so...I was left with the notion that some Dem operative had the bright idea to use this film as a political infomercial. The behavior of the main characters suggests that no politicians can be trusted, but that doesn't outweigh the tonnage of messages delivered to the viewer.Don't bother with this film."
3,Ok,Not my cup of tea. I hate it when they make a simple story all twisty for no reason at all other than trying to see intelligent and more than it really is. Boooooring
2,Poorly Finished Film,"Great cast, but this movie left you feeling like you missed the whole second half of it. There was no resolution, just a very depressing end. Not sure it was even worth one watch- for sure not worth purchasing."
3,Political and personal drama,"Ryan Gosling is supposed to be working for a governor, played by George Clooney, who wants to run for president. The rivals are involved in this conflict, but only to a small degree. The real problem involves a young intern who knows something about the governor and might reveal it. Or maybe Gosling will. I will not spoil that part.This is nothing new but is fairly interesting if you are into political stories at all."
2,DISAPPOINTING,A nomination for Best Drama Picture from the Golden Globes made me check it out. Film focuses on a Democratic Governor who seems to be on his way to the Presidency when a potential scandal hits. The scenes focus a great deal on the running process but also on certain moral choices made by the characters. There's a great cast involved but the picture just doesn't hit all the necessary points to establish a good or better political drama. Nothing really new here and the narrative flow was downright jarring at times. I don't need to be told somebody's face is half concealed in the shadows when I can see it on the screen. I'd say 80% of the narrative speaking was like that so the flow suffers as a result. STORY/PLOTTING: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE POLITICAL PROCESS: C plus to B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday.
1,Terrible,"This movie was boring, slow, and really no story unless you like listening and watching the actual primaries that are on-going now. Gosling and Clooney give b-rated performances. Who ever said Clooney could act! Don't waste your time or money on this loser!"
4,Becoming the monster...,"""Ides"" takes a look at your ""good guy"" politician and what it takes to become president.Clooney wants to be president and Gosling is his head campaign guy.Stunning performances and a tight story keep this film from becoming your average politi-thriller.I won't go into the details and ruin it.It was a good, if not totally realistic look at what goes on behind the scenes in politics.One thing the movie nailed was the fact that I wanted to take a shower after watching it...just like real life politics.Good movie,Recommended."
5,Very Very Good!,"George Clooney knows how to pick them. Over the years, I've found he rarely disappoints and knows how to pick a good script. And, based on the movies that are coming out these days, there must not be a lot of good scripts out there to choose. This was a rare treat and Ryan Gosling nails the role. I would actually watch it again and I haven't said that in a long time."
4,zombies,"I love it ,a very good movie you will enjoy this sequel alot.not as aderenal as other movies but still exciting to watch."
3,Good singles at least,"I don't own the album but I'll take Raven's word for it. Sounds like the best of Prince's filler songs, but if you're gonna emulate someone, Prince is a pretty good template obviously. ""Oh Sheila"" is catchy as all get-out."
4,There are excellent ballads.,"Apart from the famous `OH SHEILA`, there are lots of good ballads like `TONIGHT`,`DEEP INSIDE YOUR LOVE`,`OUT OF TOWN LOVER` in this first album."
1,Saddest picture quality I've ever experienced!,"I sat down with my daughter to watch my favorite movie of all time. The picture quality at times was almost un-watchable and I was embarrassed to show this special movie to my daughter with such poor quality, that I paid for!"
4,"For those who like Christopher Reeve, this is a must-see.","Very effective and romantic movie. Based on a timeless love story, it is a reminder of how true love never dies. There are also some other subtle lessons from life in the movie. The John Barry score is excellent and sets the mood very well."
5,Great Movie,I got this movie for a Christmas present. I ordered it late but to my surprise it arrived the day after Christmas. It was exactly the movie she wanted and came in perfect condition
5,Beautiful!,This movie is a stunning now as it was when I first saw it in the theater in 1980. It is a wonderful addition to the fantasy of the time travel and the space time continuum. I would recommend it to anyone with a romantic bone in their body..
4,Works but battery-saving feature is glitchy,This has an internal battery to keep the settings when the power goes out but that doesn't work too well so I plugged it into a battery back up and since then I have had no problems with it. I like this one better than the dial ones because there is no dial to hear clicking around.
4,Great product for the money.,"All-in-all a wonderful unit and easy to program. Two pairs of outlets connected to separate timers and four continuously powered outlets. I use one daytime plug for my metal halide bulb and the other for a circulation powerhead. The nighttime plugs are set up for my moonlight LEDs and another, lower-flow powerhead. You can use the remaining four outlets for normal maintenance equipment(i.e. chiller unit, heater, air pump, UV filter, etc).The only negative aspect of this unit (as well as many others) is the plug spacing when using transformer plugs (LEDs). I would have gladly given up a bit of space in my cabinet for two timed outlets spaced farther apart."
3,"Day is night, and night is day...","The clock is easy to set, and the cycle on/off times are easy to set, but the outlet colors (yellow for day, blue for night) were reversed on my unit causing no little amount of frustration. Also, if one set of outlets (the two yellow outlets, for example) are on, the other two are off. So having both day and night outlets off (or on) at the same time is impossible. Fairly useful, but still a bit annoying and a bit overpriced."
2,Great Idea But it Doesn't Work,"I give up. Every morning I come down and find the power strip in the wrong mode. I pull it out to see what's going on, and find the clock set to some random time, and all the programs gone. I reset it all. I walk by at night on the way to bed, and it's in the wrong condition again. I pull it out, and, again, it's set to completely random settings again. For right now I'm just using it by manually changing the mode. The random time display is quite interesting, though.Good idea, poor execution."
2,"Day on or night on, but not both!","This doesn't work well with fish tanks. If you look at the picture, there are white plugs (always on), yellow plugs (daytime) and blue plugs (night). The way this works is that you can setup up to 7 times for the daylight plugs to turn on and off. Whenever the daylight plugs are off, the blue plugs are on, and vice versa. So, all you can really do with this is have daytime lights and nightime lights - you cannot have lights that overlap each other."
3,"Works fine, Limited Programming","This power center works fine but misleads you into believing its programming functions are more detailed than they actually are. For example, Day (yellow) plugs are on ONLY while Blue (night) are off, always. I wanted to keep my submerged moonlights on for several hours instead of all night, this is not an option as the Blue (nights) are on until Day (yellow) turn back on. Correct me if im wrong."
1,Junk,I bought this thinking that it would be great for turning my aquarium lights on and off. This unit is a piece of junk. It lasted 3 days before it lost the presets the first time. Then I returned it for another and that one lasted a week. Ended up getting a cheap regular wall outlet timer for like 10 bucks and it works better than this thing ever did. Very disappointed with this product. I would rate it 0 stars if I could.
1,Not very user friendly.,"Horrible instructions, resets itself too easily and its a pain in the a$$ to setup. You can't even overlap your lights, it's either daylight or nightlight on."
5,What a FAMILY!!!,"As a friend of this family I assure you this story is true. They really look out for one another. A family's love could grow no stronger than the love shown in this picture perfect group. It is truly a shame. Then again, there is the old saying, ""The Good Die Young."" As for the DeCaro and Cordes', I love all of you and hope for nothing but the best. I would also like to say thank you to Aunt Mary and Uncle Phil for everything they have done. You both are truly heaven sent."
3,swearbear,"I purchased this toy knowing what it was so no surprise with the language. However, it is quite small and the audio is quite bad(quality not content, which is raunchy). It probably should be priced somewhere around 5 to 7 dollars, which would still be high given the quality. But it is a perfect gift for the person I'm giving it too."
5,Just beautifull!,After searching for Switched On Bach for more then 14 Years...i finally found it..in the Boxed Set..Its really great for me as a synth addict! especially a analog synth addict!
1,Frustrating,"Another disappointing Step workout. I'm an experienced stepper and was looking for a challenging new workout to add to my step collection. The ""challenge"" in this case was that this DVD is chock full of convoluted, complicated choreography from the very start and totally impossible to follow. I suppose it's doable if you stumble along a half dozen times as you learn the moves but when I get a new workout DVD I want to work up a sweat right away and this definitely did not do it.I agree with another reviewer who commented on the fact that camera would focus in on Patrick's face or upper body as he was doing the moves. That didn't make it any easier to learn what to do.Would have been a totally waste of money had I actually paid for it, which I thankfully did not. This will be relegated to the bottom of the pile, and perhaps eventually the bin."
2,"...so,..so......","I was really excited when I got this workout dvd, i was so ready for a semi- intense workout that would be really fun. yeah well....it didn't really work out that way. for me, and maybe i'm just slow, but the instructions were not clear and there was so much else going on while he was giving new instructions that i found it hard to follow. most of the time i had to just march in place because i couldn't keep up with the choreography. then again that might just be me. but then the dvd, brand new, first time i'd ever watched it, never been dropped or scratched, skipped. so i completely missed the second portion of the workout. so, in my opinion, if you're looking for something worth your money and time, find something else. this was too fast, confusing, and not functional to spend your money on. once again i have to say, that's just me."
3,Okay collection for the beginner,"This CD is okay, but my main problem with it is that it leaves out a lot of the excellent material Eddie recorded during his years at Motown. The cuts ""Keep On Truckin'"" and ""Boogie Down"" are included here in their unedited versions, but the some of the other songs that were originally longer (""Girl You Need A Change Of Mind"", ""Intimate Friends"", ""He's A Friend"", ""Can I"") are cut down and are really not as enjoyable as the long versions. If you're just getting into Eddie's work, then this is a good starting point, but I personally recommend getting the ULTIMATE COLLECTION, which has all those songs in their entirety. If you still find yourself wanting more of the Eddie Kendricks sound, you can also check out VINTAGE '78, or search for his other LPs on vinyl, since most of Eddie's solo works are now out of print."
3,A must for serious fans of Eddie Kendricks,A compilation of several of the best performances of one of the smoothest falsetto voices of our generation. My only regret is that more of Eddie's solo performances are not available.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. It seems very hurried and rushed, where the authors chop and change in the text. There seems to be a lot of discussion for the baseband stuff, but all the application stuff was poor. I wanted a book that told me how to create my Bluetooh applications and this one didn't.Anyone?"
3,Not Made by Martin,"Just a heads up about this product....it is NOT made by Martin. The packaging said ""RDM Enterprises Guitar Humitron."" The product seems quality (so far), but will leave an update in a few weeks after it gets some use."
4,Difficult to Read,In Standard American bidding a 2:1 bid is a one round force. In 2:1 it is forcing to game. Two versions of 2:1 exist. One by Mike Lawrence and one by Max Hardy. The Max Hardy version is almost a 100% game force. The Mike Lawrence version has many sequences that are not forcing to game. This book explains them all but it often gets difficult to read and you have to remember which sequences are not forcing when you actually use his system while playing bridge. I prefer the Max Hardy version of 2:1. If you are trying to play the Mike Lawrence version of 2:1 then this is the best book to read. For the Max Hardy Version of 2:1 I suggest Bridge In The 21st Century.If you are not a bridge player and were thinking of learning the game this book would be too difficult to read.
4,This Pelikan is one tough bird,"I suspect James Joseph Pelikan is a literarty creation, but I hope he exists. A man who cleans the vilest of homeless men and scrubs the streets of a dirty city on his hands and knees speaks volumes about Man's Kindness to his Fellow Man. What a character Martin has created! I hope several books in the ""Pelikan"" seriers are soon to follow."
5,"Very good, especially in winter","I had a similar pressure gauge, but without the hose and the pressure relief valve. In winter and with bad light it was very often difficult to connect the gauge to the valve and then read the result, close to the ground, holding the gauge (with increasingly cold fingers) firmly to the tire valve while you're trying to read the pressure. This new one is so much more comfortable: You don't have to press it firmly against the valve, but you can take a reading and then look at it leisurely and higher up. When you have read the result you release the pressure in the gauge with the little button."
2,Dissappointing,"The video quality is fuzzy. Poor transfer from VHS to DVD. The content could have been better. More informative, less fluff. Barely worth 5 bucks."
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book,"""Gee, how can I make some money from writing about the internet? I know -- I'll write some worthless stuff about getting connected to the internet (target group-African bushmen?), and then I'll just put down the on-line investing sites I found after a few days of random surfing."" I'm sure a similar train of thought went through the author's mind just before he came up with this lemon of a book. At the time of this review, this book had a four star review average; these other reviews that said this book was ""brilliant"" made me laugh. Shakespeare is brilliant; this author's intentions are merely expedient."
2,A Basic Book,"I expected great things from this book , as I am greatly influenced by the reviews posted in Amazon, and most people loved the book. However, the book is well written , but as Clara Peller said : Where's the beef ! I disagree with many of his sites , especially Reuters Moneynet, being chosen first in so many categories. The basic message, find a few sites to use and stick with them , and do not spend all of your time surfing sites, makes total sense. But I do not feel that he accomplished his task . However , use one of the megasites, such as wallstreetview or investorlinks to get a feel for what is out there , and then pick the best news site, price history site etc.to use in the future , do not just use his sites. Better yet subscribe to online investor magazine and get current reviews of most of the sites. Overall 4 stars for the basic investor one star if you have spent much time on the net."
5,A great synoptic album.,"Life stuff from Patty on the road with a guitar that's like a videocam trained on the street, on the shadows, on the mirror. Subtle, raucus, hurting, laughing. If you're not a Larkin fan, this album will probably make you one."
5,Awesome grip,"Grip had weight, felt strong, I even felt more confident with it before I installed it, lol.This really was a great buy, I highly recommend it to anyone looking."
4,Very satisfied with this,"I gave this item 4 stars because I took value into consideration, but other than that it really is of very good quality and if you can afford to spend the money I don't think you will be sorry.It's not at all flimsy or cheap looking, everything was in perfect condition and it was a breeze to put together. My 3 year old had a smile ear to ear when she saw this. It really adds the finishing touches to her room which is of course a princess theme set up.So again, if you can get past the cost of this, you will more than likely be happy with the purchase."
3,"Disjointed and overlong, if pretty","The Bottom Line:Australia makes an appealingly quirky 85 minute movie, as Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman team up to drive their cows to Darwin, but then unfortunately there's still 80 more minutes before the movie ends; it samples various subplots (The Japanese attack! Well-meaning but out-of-place criticism of Australia's treatment of its native peoples!) without ever finding a narrative thrust to match its first half, and all the well-shot scenes of carnage and destruction can't change the fact that this is one big jumbled mess of a film.2.5/4"
5,Right up there with GONE WITH THE WIND and TITANIC!,"Right up there with GONE WITH THE WIND and TITANIC! Can't say it better than that! Linda Masemore Pirrung, Author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS EXPLOSION IN PARIS"
3,Too long,"We rented this movie with high expectation, and we were disappointed. The movie was too long, some parts were boring. We couldn't connect with the romance in the movie."
2,"Too, too long and too uneven!","I've watched over 2 hours of this film and can honestly say I am not even going to finish it. This lack of interest says it all for me. The film's start was promising but the film should have ended after the big cattle drive to the WWI ship. After that, too many ups and downs for me."
5,Awesome Australia,"This was one of the few movies I went to the theater to see and could hardly wait for the DVD. There is a wonderful story and insight into the mysterious continent and its' history and its' people. Where does the time go when watching this fast moving and exciting film? Brandon Walters, the Aboriginal little boy, is captivating. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are most believable in both their roughed and tender scenes. And, speaking of scenes and scenery. They simply do not come any better! There is such a span of themes and lives and locations that there is something for everyone."
2,A wait that wasn't worth it,"It took a little longer to get in the mail than I thought it would, but the movie was entertaining . I can't say I would recommend it though."
4,Austrialia,Was a fair story. Love to see every thing about Austrialia. The movie was a little long butlots of action. The little boy made the picture for us. Made us take out the Crocodile Dundee movies again and watch. Would like more of those to watch.
2,This movie never ever ends.... at least it seems this way,"I thought this movie had a good story.... decent acting and if they would have ended it at an hour and forty-five minutes I would have given it 4 stars.I really didn't think there was a ton of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman but enough to pass.The problem with this movie is that it just kept going and going and going. It just wouldn't end until they completed, what seemed like, the same story line again and again."
2,Ausrralia,I enjoyed the movie but some of the middle scenes jumped back and forth which at times spoilt our viewing enjoyment.There was obviously a defect in the disc. This is the first time we have had a problem with a purchase from Amazon.
4,Review of Australia,"A visually moving, heart warming story that shows an unusual, nontraditional family that has all the elements of a ""real"" family. Great acting, great photography, and what's not to like about Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman? Even though it is a long movie, it did not seem that way while watching it."
1,the worst movie I've ever seen.,"Australia [Blu-ray]When I see a bad movie and am asked for a review, I jokingly reply ""that was the second worst movie I've ever seen only because I can't remember which one I thought was worse."" I remember now. Russel Crowe deserves an Oscar for jumping ship on this."
1,Oscar nomenee????,"Very bad,boring poor acting I wasted my money!!!Oscars nomination?Well I guess if you put in the movie oppressed blacks and racial discrimination 90% of the time you will get a nomination,it becames just poor taste regurgitating all the same...time for healing yet???"
5,absolutely magnificent,"when this came out at the theaters the critics didn't understand the directors vison, they had to look beyond just see how the movie should been seen instead that called it misdirected, on the contrary this is film making in epic story telling and scope this film should have been called one of the best films of the year."
2,Ok but I found I was bored during the movie,"This is a good story and has a great script ... but I found when I was watching some parts of the movie that it didn't make sense. I wondered why the editor made that scene short or in other scenes soooo long. The acting was hitting the mark for the most part though in some scenes it seemed the director wasn't thinking ... I recall thinking why they used that expression and sometimes the scene just seemed out of place. It was hard to follow at the begging and whats with the mumbling, no I am not talking about the accent.Some of the action scenes, for example when riding horses, had the fake look. The war scene at the end was great so I know there was potential. I think the movie had the tools to be a great movie but just didn't come together as well as it should have."
3,Truly an Epic,"Understanding ""epic"" to be a story that celebrates heroic feats in a way that is not necessarily factual, it is a perfect descriptor for Australia. Bigger than life in some respects, much smaller in others, the story of the Stolen Generation is an important one and deserves better telling than it got here. Hugh Jackman was excellent while Nicole Kidman rarely came across as more than an actress with insufficient emotional investment in the role. Not a blow out but a movie that definitely did not live up to the hype."
1,Huuuuuuuuge disapointment all over,"Honestly? I gave up on this movie after about one hour. I get that it's more of a tale than a story, so I mostly forgave the no-depth characters, the ""Disney"" feel to the frontier experience. Nicole Kidman's new face has about two expressions, and none of them convince here. Hugh Jackamn oes what he can, and rather well, but frankly he must have felt awfully alone here.And then, there's the visual side of it. We expect great things from Luhrmann, visually. After all, he has a vivid style and knoww how to use technical stuff in a seamless way. In here... heck, the FX feel like the dino run in King Kong. They're ugly, and snap you right out of the movie.So I gave up on the movie. My wife didn't. And then told me she should have."
1,Absolutely Terriible!! Like a Bad Cartoon!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen -- would have given it a NEGATIVE 4-star rating if it had been possible to do so. It was so offensibly bad, I stopped watching 20 minutes into it. Will put the DVD out in the spring subdivision garage sale and hope some unsuspecting chump will be willing to pay 25 cents for it."
1,Rose from my easy chair 3 times thinking it was over.,"I knew this was a long movie, but 3 times I started getting out of my chair to take the dvd out because I thought it was over. But no...they hadn't worked in all the cliches yet.At the end of the movie there was a text note that in 2008 the Prime Minister of Australia apologized to the Aboriginal people. In 2009 he should apologize to everyone for this movie."
3,Too much visual !,"This is an epic film, sometimes remember me Indiana Jones. Great fotography, sometimes too candy. Great quality video and sound in blu-ray !People who begins to see any kind of movies in blu-ray hardly can go back to DVD, unless the DVD has a great quality video, but when you see the same film in blu-ray ..."
4,Great,"Great movie, long movie, but it had lots of great scenes that were funny, sexy, and kept me watching them over and over."
2,Feel like you've seen this movie before?,"It's a sequence of familiar plots ripped off from other movies and stitched together in an improbable story. We start with the big cattle drive with an unlikely trail crew and it's ""The Cowboys."" Then it's a daring decision to cross the impasible desert and it's ""Lawrence of Arabia."" And what's at the end of the trail? ""Pearl Harbor."""
5,Australia - Like You've Never Seen It Before!,"After I saw this movie in the theater, I decided that it was something that I MUST have for my collection when it was released in DVD. In the meantime, Santa Claus brought me a new Sony KDL-46XBR8 1080p TV and a Sony Blu-ray S550 player to go with it. So, when ""Australia"" was released in Blu-ray, that's what I bought. To describe the movie in Blu-ray as ""breathtaking"" would be an understatement.In addition to memorable performances by Nichole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, the new child star, Brandon Walters, who plays the part of ""Nullah,"" will absolutely steal your heart. The casting in the movie could not have been better. The scenery is likewise ""breathtaking.""I know that some critics took cheap shots at the movie, but after watching it now six times, it gets better with each viewing, and the Blu-ray high-definition will leave you mesmerized. Once you see it, you will never forget it."
1,Won't play on all blu-ray players,"We tried two different copies of this blu-ray disc from the video store on our player, which has the latest upgrade, but neither would play. Apparently the manufacturer of this disc doesn't care if people waste their money on a blu-ray that hasn't been made to common standards.Avoid!"
1,Beware: Un-official DVD-R release.,"Lancelot Link has fallen into the Public Domain. This is an un-official DVD-R release of the show. An official release is yet to be made. (Even the 2-disc yellow box set is not an official release, but it is a real DVD.)The episodes here are mastered from dirty, scratched, faded 16mm film prints.Avoid this over priced home-burned release! Wait for an official release."
2,You may need to modify the table to get sturdy legs,Looked fine when I got the package. It was packed well and efficiently with no damage. But when I went to assemble the table I noticed that the bottom piece of the table top was mounted off center so that the notches to hold the table legs were too big or too little. When the notch is too little the top of the leg does not sit flush with the mounted board when screwed together. It would have wobbled eventually if I had not cut two of them larger.
3,Cute but...,"This is a cute book, but I prefer the big dog in The Wisdom of Zeus. If you are looking for a gift, I'd recommend the Wisdom Of Zeus over Zelda --I gave the book out at XMAS as gifts and never received one complaint or blank stare."
5,#1 Beauty Of Birds Collection 2005 Male Northern Cardinal,"Ah who has not looked out their window and seen this beautiful bird against the green of a pine tree? Perhaps trying to stay warm, or just waiting his turn at the feeder? Now you can bring him indoors and gaze upon Him against YOUR Green tree,,or white or what color have you in Hallmarks collection of Birds! This collection only started a few yrs ago so its nice and early now to get in on it while its still young and not have to pay too much $$ to get in on it! They are beautiful ornaments, fastened with a ribbon and a sprig of foliage where their feet would be. As if perching. My bird came quickly and was nicely packaged and just exactly as described so he was able to join the rest of his ""flock"" upon the tree this year! I highly recommend him, the seller, and getting in on this collection ASAP!"
4,good cd,I bought this cd a few years ago on a diffrent label.Its a good cd.My babys gone is a real standout.I would highly recommend it.
3,Great Blend of the old and the New,"There are so many reasons this is a good film. The biggest is that it has a main plot that even little children can understand and therefore watch it over and over again.The other reason you should watch this film is for all of the little subplots. Let's see, there's a single mother, corporate greed, a washed up artist, an over-the-hill boxer, an older couple one of whom is a little confused, and best of all, there's little UFO's!I'm sure you'll recognize at least a few of the actors who are very accomplished and pull this story off in a very believable way.And, whether believable or not, there actually is a happy ending, but I won't spoil it for you."
5,"It's pure ""Feel Good"" entertain. without ""ShootUmUp"" stuff.","It is a great film to sit back and view without the expectation of learning a ""life lesson."" It is pure entertainment with a great cast, and beleive it or not nobody gets killed! A true example of a movie that can entertain both adults and children. To the individuals who have put this movie down, I beleive they have either been to removed from the little things in life that makes one enjoy ""warm and cozy"" movies or are over impressed with the ""razzel dazzel"" special effects of other moveis. I beleive there is room for both!!"
4,Very funny movie,"This is a really cute movie that is a winner.The models used for the aliens are AMAZING, and look much more realistic than shotty computer animation that is used today. I also get more out of the movie everytime I see it. It works on multiple levels, and has a strong underlying theological messages. Many of the more obscure details require you watch the movie more than once. It is an excellent movie and definitely worth watching."
4,Great accesory for electric smoker.,"This is great for monitoring the smoker's internal temperature and the display is large enough that it can be viewed from my kitchen window with the smoker sitting outside. My only complaint is that once it is set to the mode to view average temperature, it beeps almost constantly for temperatures over or under by a set number of degrees. Would be even better if there was a means to stop the beeper and still display average temperature."
2,The Trouble I See,"An excellent grouping of poems. They each reflect real life circumstances in today's busy world. I am pleased to be an integral part of my grandchildren's lives. As such, this book is quite relevant to circumstances that they could face as they grow up and out into a more independent world. Thanks Vickie for having the heart to tell it like it is. Your sensitivity and talent certainly shines through your work. You help us face and address so many of the current social ills!"
5,Hard and Fast - Bishop Keeps it Going,"I have seen Jon perform several times at Studio 64, Club Montage in San Diego - I recognize several of the songs, but this is fresh music to anyone that has not seen him live. I've seen Jon follow-up Kimball Collins and Christopher Lawrence, and he blew away both times. When Jon starts a set, the crowd goes up another level. I am a trance lover first, such as Acosta, ATB, Oakenfold, Micro, Tiesto, etc. This is not trance. The BPM is in the 140 range - no, this is not happy hardcore (thank god!), just a harder style of house that gets you moving. I guess the best way to describe this disc is ""energy"". Overall, this is a great disc to add to your collection. If you haven't heard of Jon Bishop, he's starting to get quite popular. You'll understand why after hearing this. This is a definitive clubbing album - buy it!"
4,Very uplifting!,"The story of Meg and how she returns to her painful past is full of twists and turns and surprises. Best of all,though, was ""listening"" to someone else tell the story of how they ""lost"" God and came back to find him. I think anyone who is looking for a captivating read with a religous theme will really enjoy this book."
2,For Fans Only,"Don't buy this movie unless you are a huge fan of Priyanka, Akshay, or Salman, or have clinical depression and need something painfully goofy to make it through the night. And for the love of Ganesh, do not let this be your first Bollywood movie because you'll never watch another one after this. Unless you are five years old, in which case you might like the over-the-top screwball acting, transparent plotline, and uninspired dance numbers.Why two stars instead of one?The technical quality of this Blu-ray is good, the picture is crystal clear, and English subtitles work fine. The movie was shot in Goa, which is nice. It has Priyanka Chopra in it. Also, it stars Priyanka Chopra. Akshay Kumar and Salman Khan have a lot of fans and you might be one of them. Priyanka Chopra is in it. You might like the songs. Salman takes his shirt off a lot so if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. Oh, also, this movie has Priyanka Chopra in it."
5,Love this stuff,Cannot find this locally and it's here at a great price. Shipped very well. Very happy. Just placed my second order last week.
3,Sales Dragon,"A fun motivational book--to this day the phrase ""I am a sales dragon, a master of the marketplace"" brings good thoughts. It certainly doesn't share any great secrets, but it's fun to see the same old sales mantras in a different format."
4,This cotton mattress pad works great!,I have been very happy with this mattress pad. It works great and has saved me from having to change the whole bed many times. It is still working great after 3 months of washing and reusing.
4,This is good too.,"This cookbook is good too. I like the other one better but I am still glad I got this one. Again, very down to earth. My only comment would be that many of the recipes have 10-12 cups of flour and are very huge quantity. I am still glad I bought it and I can cut the recipes down. A great companion to the other one I bought."
1,NHRA BUFF,96 TEARS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION WHEN IT FIRST WAS INTRODUCED!!!! ON A ORIGINAL SCALE OF 1TO10 IT GETS A GENEROUS (2)
2,Not Great,Too easily damaged. Handles pull out too easily. One of three baskets purchased broke within a week. Not worth the money
2,"Good Quality, terrible iron","You can tell this is a quality iron, it doesnt feel cheap, but this iron is down right frustrating to work with. It ruined a pair of pants I had because the setting was too high, but that NEVER happened to those pants with my other irons since I've had those pants for years now. Plus I'd like to note that I did NOT leave the iron on the pants..as soon as I touch the pants it singed them.Whats worse is there is ALWAYS fabric getting stuck on the iron, no matter how much I clean it just continued to get residue stuck on it. Then when i started steaming the darn iron sprayed brown stuff on my clothes...after that I was thru! In the garbage it went!"
1,It's JUNK,I purchased this T-fal iron as a gift for my daughter.What a disappoinment. The darn thing leaks all over the place. She only used it once and unfortunately she had thrown out the box and is not able to return it. It's a piece of JUNK. What a waste of money this is.
2,Stick with stainless steel plates,I bought this in December of 08 and the sole plate is already ruined leaving residue on my clothes. I use only distilled water in the iron. I'm not going to even bother having it replaced I'm just going back to the stainless steel irons.
2,Not as good as with wood - slippery - noisy,"If you have used wooden boards for years, you will most probably not like this. The knife contact is not 100%, leaving partially cut pieces. It is also slippery and noisy."
4,Great,Excellent quality. If you need a small cutting board this will do the trick. Will not slide around on counter.
2,Kindle Issues & Flat Translation,The endnotes were not activated in the Kindle edition and this was one of the most lifeless translations of this masterwork that I have ever read. The Kindle issues bothered me enough that I returned the book.I'd recommend a miss.
1,Disappointed,It said 5mm. Didn't say it was completely round. And no way does it fit like a 16 inch necklace. It fit like a choker and NOTHING will fit on it because it's too thick! I am going to try to return it.
5,Bath bench,"The bath bench arrived very quickly and is just what I expected. It works very well. It would be a bit difficult for an elderly person or someone with small motor control issues to assemble, so paying to have it arrive assembled would be their best option. Have used it and am completely satisfied with my purchase."
4,This is a good cheap replacement vcr.,"I bought it as a replacement for a 6 year old vcr that died. It's a great value for the money and unlike the other reviewer, I have not had any clicking sounds or odd behavior from it at all.Great product!"
1,JUNK!! BROKEN!!,"It looks brand new but it doesn't work!! The tape would play for a minute, and the machine would stop, then the tape pops out. I tried several tapes, and the same thing happens. No warranty, so it was a waste of money!!"
4,A departure for me personally,"This book is a departure for me. The book is a ghost story, and it is romantic suspense. Anyway, I understand that this book is also a departure for Christianna Brand. Since this is the first book that I've read of hers, I cannot attest to whether or not is is a different genre for her, but I intend to read other more conventional ttles from this author. Ms. Brand is an excellent author, and she has an uncanny sense for creating a sense of time. This book is about a 400 year old curse that has haunted the young brides of the Hillbourne family. It is also about twins, and the changing of places that occurs all the time with identical twins. The book is creepy as befits a good ghost story, and it leaves a chill when it is finished. A very good story, and an excellent ghost story."
3,"Very pleasant music, but sorry, this doesn't really do it for me","I bought this disc partly because I am enjoying exploring different types of dance music, and was influenced by the reviews below. Which is why I'm writing this review, even at the risk of seeming like a heathen.The disc is pleasant enough, but I don't listen to it very much and I was very dissapointed when I first heard it. The problem is partly because of my expectations - I had supposed and hoped it would be more.. dynamic. Although there are some fine tunes here, I find myself irritated that many of them are actually so gentle that they are hard to hear properly unless you turn the volume way up. There are a few more lively ones in the selection, but overall I found the disc to have a soporific effect.All right, all right, it's my subjective criticism, and I've said too much, but I felt I needed to balance out the reviews below."
1,Don't buy it,The book had very little information that was useful...buy instead...Water Soluble Oils..
4,Great intro to Geology/Earth Science,"Great 5th/6th grade level text to introduce earth science/geology topics. Nice diagrams and illustrations. Includes simple experiments. Touches on minerals, energy resources, plate tectonics, earthquakes, volcanoes, erosion, oceanography, and weather and climate. Many topics are re-introduced in college level texts. Great jumping off point for homeschoolers looking for a book to guide them through earth science studies."
2,Has a Short Effect on Mouth Sores,"The active ingredient in this product is Phenol, which is a very mild anesthetic. It will have some positive effect on oral ulcerations, but the effect will not last very long and you will have to keep applying it over and over.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
1,too small,was way smaller than what it claimed. my daughter is a size 5t or small and this was extremely short on her! the headband barely fit around her doll! I returned it~
3,Way too large for my 8 year old,"I didn't nailed the size so it ended up being too big for her. When I unfolded the cape, the color was faded (where it was folded). She put it on when we gave it to her. Didn't touch it ever since."
2,cheaply made,"I loved the look of the costume, but it was literally ripping at the seams as I put it on my daughter. Definitely not worth the money spent on it. It didn't even last one evening before falling apart."
1,"received wrong item, can't believe they screwed this up so badly","The sizing for this product was poorly labeled on the Amazon website, and thus it was not possible to pick the correct size. Using the sizing chart I selected a size that should fit a 5 year old, but was instead sent a size which would fit a 5th grader.On top of that, the return policy for this company is posted on Amazon as follows:""We have a simple and liberal return policy. It is the same policy as offered by Amazon. We want you to be happy. As long as the product is unused and returned in original packaging within 30 days, we will issue full refund (no restocking fee deducted) of the product cost paid""When talking to the agent at the company, this was NOT the return policy and I was told that in fact I cannot return the product for a full refund, only exchange.So no, this product was not enjoyable for my child, and I feel less inclined to buy anything on Amazon for a while."
3,Entertaining but without depth,"This is an early 1952 western where the films are frequently grade B without any depth. It is supposedly the true story of the gunslinger John Wesley Hardin who was born in 1853 and based upon a book that he wrote and published upon his release from prison in 1896. Hardin admitted killing some people at different times, but said it was always in self defense. He tells how his father was an authoritative preacher who beat him. Part of his problem was that he gambled too much. He was in love with a nice girl that his father helped raise who was killed when he was running from a posse. He moved from state to state and married a saloon girl and settled on a farm. But the Texas Rangers captured him and he was sentenced to 25 years in jail. He was pardoned after 16 years, and came home to find that he his son idolized him and wanted to be a gunfighter like him. However, Hardin did not want to have anything to do with guns any more."
1,UGH!,"What the heck! This book is a waste of time and money! Katie acts like a five year old! I mean, come ON! I got over my fear of boys in 3rd grade, and Katie's in 6th! I also think that a girl her age would have more insight on the world. A horrible book!"
4,Beautifully made pendant!,"The craftmanship of this pendant is wonderful; everything is lined up the way it should be. Nothing about it is a 'second' as can be found on the net. The silver is substantial, not thin and foil-like, and I get many compliments when wearing it."
3,"So Many Positives, Offset by Poor Zippers","Purchased for carrying small tools and supplies in a tool bag. Things like socket sets, small screwdrviers, etc.PROS:- Great Looking- Excellent variety of bag shapes and capacity.- The largest bag has two compartments, very handy for carrying tools.- Good bag construction, seams are strong, material is strong.- Each bag has straps on the back for carrying on a belt, like fanny-pack straps.CONS:- Zippers were unreliable out-of-the-box. I have to be very careful with them so they do not get crossed up or hung up. What a shame, good product otherwise. And, since you experience the zippers on each use, they offset almost all other pros."
5,Great for my purpose,"Use it to hold small parts, hardware, or tools in my larger tool bag. Easier to find small itmes and because they are differnt color and shape it's easier to identify the contents."
4,"Better than meh, but not awesome","I expected these to be heavier than they were.They work well and are somewhat robust, but the metal is fairly thin."
4,2 for 1 special,"I ordered these bottle openers for my friend who has a yacht and didn't have a good bottle opener. The things I liked about them is that they are stainless steel, which is important to anyone around water! Also, the fact that there were 2 sold as a pair was perfect, 1 for his upstairs and 1 for his downstairs salon. I had them both engraved with the name of his Yacht and gave them to him for his birthday. He loved them. They seem very strong as they are pretty thick metal."
5,STEVEN SEAGAL MOGO PRIEST - 5 STARS,Steven Seagal is an amazing blues artist. His latest album Mojo Priest seems to be a special contribution to the blues legends. You really need to listen to the lyrics and appreciate this new release. The songs from Muddy Waters are phenomenal. All of the Blues legends would give this one a five star rating!
5,CBS cancelled the best show on TV,"Network TV, especially CBS, has lost its mind because they had a terrific action drama with ""the Unit"" with close to real life stories and they cancel it. All they care about are their stupid reality shows and dumb not so funny situation comedies. I'm fed up with those type of shows which I never watch and just rely on slipping a DVD into the machine to watch what I want. Come on FOX or NBC or ABC, pick up this GREAT show so we don't miss a beat for the Fall. You'll have a ready made audience. I remember this same situation with the old series ""JAG"" which was cancelled also after 2 years on NBC and then CBS picked it up and it ran for 6 more years."
5,Selenium 800W Subwoofer,High quality speaker. Excellent sound quality. Vendor was excellent: warp speed delivery.
5,Great little drum,2 1/2 year old and 9 month old love it. Very cute detail on the inside and the kids love tapping on it (it is not an annoying sound).
3,Compatibility confusion,"Not a review, but a question: if the Universal refill kits work for any printer, why do a lot of other sites, like the links listed above, list specific brands that a particular kit works for, as though the kit will only work for those brands?"
3,good but not as good,I love these cough drops for dry throat and places people are smoking. They are very hard to find. I did not feel the taste was exactly the same as they were in the day. The box looks different but has a picture of the old box on it. good
3,A very funny and dumb book!,"I laughed out loud when I first read the dumb bunnies and I still do now! Even though it has no point, you can't help but laugh at the way that the Dumb Bunnies act!"
1,The code is garbage.,"The algorithms are very well explained but there is no need for this book if you have the FORTRAN book. Just terrible C code. Like indexes starting at 1 instead of 0, just like in FORTRAN. No pointers just arrays. C'mon...."
4,best for enginerr who have sufficient mathmatical backgroud.,"When you have sufficient mathematical background and basci ANSI C programming, this book help you understand and code program for many numerical analysis field greatly. Moreover the available C code help us great portablity and flexibility. From college, this book help my work very much"
4,"Excellent reference, but poor writing style and license","I had to endure reading this book for 2 long semesters, and I've come to know some parts of it pretty well. I'll try to be short and say that the book is an excellent reference for the practicioner (and for the poor student:) - however, the ill-placed ""jokes"" have terribly annoyed me and my fellow class mates. Entire pagagraphs in almost every section dedicated to some second-tier humor were not so helpful in solving numerical problems.The license for the code is just bad and I found it rather pointless, given the cost of the book (for me it's expensive; and I know it's downloadable). The authors should maybe reconsider this at a later stage...PS: The GNU Scientific Library implements most, if not all, of the NR routines. It might be worth checking out, since it's also in plain C."
4,5' bunk boards,"When the box arrived and inventory was done on the parts, brackets were missing. Fortunately I was replacing some smaller older bunks and used those brackets. Would have had to wait for brackets without those older parts. Other than that, installation was painless using an air rachet."
5,excellent coverage of a wide variety of drugs,"From the back: Drugs and Horses, the fourth title in the Compass Points series is a user-friendly and understandable reference tool in which the author analyses the correct use, benefits and side-effects of many popular drugs. Modern medicine is of enormous importance to owners yet also a potential mine-field to competitors....But there are also moral issues which the author discusses and various standard rules which she highlights."
2,All right,"Holds a charge for about an hour... I know I should unplug it occasionally, but it doesn't keep going long enough for me to remember to switch back and forth. Guess I should just find out if laptop will run with no battery at all and just use it for emergencies!"
1,It was supposed to be Toshiba brand battery!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The battery I received is not the battery I ordered. I ordered Toshiba PA3534U-1BRS and instead i got a replacement PA3533U-1BRS-of no name manufacturer. The battery they sell is said to be Toshiba brand PA 3534U-1BRS,it says that all over,they even send you an e-mail confirming that it is Toshiba PA3534U-1BRS that is being mailed to you. When I received the package it turned out that it was a battery that is not made by the Toshiba. The battery I received doesn't even have a name and to make it better it has a totally different number (PA3533U-1BRS). If I wanted a replacement battery instead of genuine battery I would have gotten it for $35 not $50. I will never buy from his seller again and i suggest for anyone who is looking for genuine laptop batteries to look somewhere else."
4,It really is both books.,"This book really is just a combination of The Messies Manual and The Messie Motivator, back to back under one cover. There isn't even a separate preface for this edition. Two for the price of one."
3,Insight Cuttlebone Holder,"To my disappointment, my birds ignored their cuttlebone in this.Maybe the size of holder was the problem and they was used to seeingjust the cuttlebone by itself. So, instead I used it to holdtheir millet.. worked good."
5,A Great Book,"I'm not much of a book reader, but when I picked up Potato Queen, I couldn't put it down. Sy writes with such vivid imagery and creates such compelling characters that I was instantly sucked into the world he creates. The book has humor, too. It brought back a lot of memories.Mark GreenbaumFIVE STARS"
3,Nice Watch,"I really like this watch. It is big, and heavy and is pretty solid. I only wear it rarely as a change, because it is so big. I have worn a Timex T62951 for years which is much more comfortable. I like the Nike watch, but it just seems too big for every day use if you are active."
4,"Wow, that is a big watch or just ""Wow!""","I usually get ""Wow! That is a big watch"" or just ""Wow, nice watch."" I say, yeah I bought it on the web and I had no idea how big it was going to be. This watch is big. It's surprisingly not very heavy at all. Very well put together. The band is some space age type super vulcanize rubber. I'm only half joking. I don't know what the stuff is, but it's very comfortable and super durable.The glass is amazingly scratch resistant. I've looked at the face a couple of times after whacking it on a door or a computer or whatever and thought, ""this is it, scratch city"" and nothing. Not even the slightest scratch. Again, I think Nike is using alien technology - probably from the Vulcans.I don't use any of the features. There are a few I'm sure. I just haven't been interested in any of the features from day one. It was really strange, I just took the instruction booklet and hucked in a drawer.That's all I have to say on this watch. Oh yeah, did i mention it's huge."
2,Hmmm,"My baby is 6-months old and it's not one of her favourite toys, since she prefers smaller objects that she can easily grasp...the blocks are too big and she loses interest very quickly."
4,Seductive One,Good Book for easy reading. The series was good to rea together as it sets up plot & provides good character development!
5,A very informative book with great stories and history,"I consider this one of the best books I have ever written. The Kebra Nagast tells us the biblical background of the Rastafari culture and faith. When I read this book , I was very moved by it and it taught me many things about the Rasta beliefs. It contains great tales of wisdom by Rastas and information of what the Rastas believe in. This book contains information passed down from many generations. I strongly recommend this book to any Rasta or person who is intersted in the Rastafari faith."
4,Good background on Rastafarianism,"Good read. Explains the Rasta tradition, where it comes from, how it ties into Christianity and the Bible, and has developed since its establishment in the early 20th century. Also has Marley quotes and shows his strong inspiration in Christian text. If your interested in learning more about traditional Rastafarianism, this book is a good read."
2,Dazed and Confused,"This book, although beautifully written, did not make sense. I was intrigued by the characters yet finished the book not understanding their motivations. I would have liked to know more about the narrator, Susan, and her life immediately after the fatal accident. Instead I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story, with big gaps missing throughout. Perhaps some skillful editing would have made this more of a complete tale."
4,Great fun,"Yes, this is a Bollywood film with all the standard content. The story on this one is very good and the actions scenes, although many are unbelievable, are still fun to watch. If your going to dissect the movie for whatever reason, music, action, special effects, your not going to enjoy it. We enjoyed it enough to purchase a copy, then watch Dhoom 2 and wait for Dhoom 3."
5,Amazing Sound,"Besides the well-crafted musicianship, this is one of the most techically perfect CDs I've ever heard. I don't know what microphones were used, how they were placed, or what equipment the music was recorded on but every song has so much PRESENCE. People who complain about the lack of ""warmth"" on CDs should listen to this one. You'd swear the performers are right in the room with you!"
4,"Not the easiest read, but worth it","The most obvious feature of this book is the language; it makes difficult going at times, particularly when first starting, but once you get into it the story draws you in, making the effort worthwhile. The character of Annie is particularly engaging, making the circumstances of her life particularly moving. This is not a book for everyone, but if you can get past the hurdles it's a worthwhile read."
3,Dissappointed with the producer,"I am a great fan of Montgomery, especially her 'Anne of Green Gables' books. I have read them a thousand times when i was a child and now a mother. I highly recommend them to all. However, I am deeply shocked and dissapointed that the movies were not quite the same as the original story.First 2 productions were , in my opinion, considered pretty distorted. But the 3rd was even worse!! It's definitely not Anne of Green Gables. Hope that someday somebody would come up with the precise story/movie based on the original books of Montgomery."
2,Tunnel not well made.,"When I took the tunnel out of the box I could see there were tears in the seams. My dogs were very happy to use the tunnel, but within the first two days of use, there was a tear in the fabric from the dogs running through. The material used is not strong rip-stop fabric, but just light-weight nylon. Nevertheless, since my budget won't accomodate the price of a well-made tunnel right now, I exchanged this kit for another. You get what you pay for.It's winter here and the ground is frozen, so I did not try the other items."
4,Cheap product.,"Don't expect much here. Looks really cheap and smells like death (you know, that disgusting smell that cheap products have). But everything came in one piece and works alright. One of the stakes broke off in the ground.It's really one of those products you buy thinking you'll use it, but it ends up collecting dust."
5,Refreshing classical approach...,"If you are a guitarist, as well as a percussionist, as I am, and enjoy our native american music, you'll love this book/CD combo. Superb classical writings with a percussive twist to smoothly fit in with the native american music. Excellent to play along to with native flutes. Many songs are in a perfect minor key. Simple charts to follow along with if you can read music. I would say you would need to have moderate to professional experience to read the charts. However, the CD is excellent just to lay back and enjoy! Anyone would enjoy the music!"
3,Nice Patterns,"Would have been more pleased with this purchase if the book and patterns were delineated by level of experience. Great pattern choices - most of them, however, are for the experienced/expert knitter and not for beginners or intermediate beginners."
2,Deceiving Title,"Chapter Listing: Iconic History, Contemporary Icons, Pick and Choose, Internet Icons, Case Studies, DESIGNING ICONS, and Reference.Icon History actually is, let's look at WINDOW'S icon's since 3.1. If you have used a computer for a small bit of time, this chapter is unneccesary for you to read.Contemporary Icons: Today's Window's icons and some of Macs. We're talking folders and recycling bins. If you are interested in program icons, you will be sadly disappointed.The next three chapters are devoted to ""look at this cool set of Bart Simpson icons you can download!"". This is not for a designer.The 6th out of 7 chapters is where it actually gets into design. It is remotely useful, but lacks much depth. If you are interested in creating cool folder icons, this is for you. If you are interested in the vast array of other ways icons can be used electronically, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,"So so product, bad materials",I purchased one of these DVDs and watched it once. I put it on a shelf for a couple of years and when I tried to play it again it wouldn't work. I contacted the author about obtaining a replacement disc. He asked for a small amount and I agreed to pay it. After that he never answered my emails again. His poor materials are only matched by his worse customer service. Stay away!!!
3,Intresting but boring,"I found this video at times very interesting but a lot of times very boring, especially when the audience got to ask questions, most of the time you couldn't make out what they were saying. You can learn some but you'll have to sit thru lots of boring lecture nit picking the nuggets."
2,"Great subject, well written, poorly organized","Tom Bergeron is a great writer, and the subject is both important and interesting; so I found myself wondering exactly why I had to keep fliping back and forth to make his points make sense.The book is entertaining; and he held my interest the entire time, but I kept wondering exactly how all of this related to his point. Up until chapter 6 I wouldn't have been able to tell you what the book was about had it not been printed on the back cover. His editors shouldn't have allowed it to come out before it got some better organization.I love what I got on his main subject: data preservation and the need for it; I only wish there was more of that and less of the tangentially related stuff that fills out the book."
5,Well worth reading,"Morgan Wootten is probably THE most successful high school basketball coach, and his book is one that I believe coaches at all levels can benefit from. I have found that the principles, plays and strategies he has written to be very beneficial in my own development as a coach. Plays and diagrams are simple and complete, and his focus on developing his kids as both individuals and players is great reading. This book is one you will want to take your coaching and your team to ""the next level."""
2,not the best,"the name of these hip scarves is true. they are deff. imperfect! they are made really cheap, and dont really stay on your hips really well when your dancing. i wouldnt buy another one."
3,Beautiful pan,"I have this exact 12 inch pan which my husband bought in Villedieu, Normandy quite a few years ago. It's heavy, well made and beautiful. I love the way it looks and use it more for decoration than cooking. The heat conduction is good but it does stick with some foods so I prefer non-stick All-Clad or my old cast iron."
2,"Viewing angle for Sylvania 15"" LCD TV","The picture appears to be fine but only if your head is above the TV where you get a viewing angle of 90 degrees to the face. The ""photo stand"" makes the set sit tilted back at an angle as a picture frame would sit on your desk. This puts you below the 90 degree dead-on angle and the picture appears dark and without contrast. If it came with a stand that mounted the TV in a true vertical orientation it would be OK. The pictures of this TV on Amazon.com make it appear to be oriented in the true vertical position which is misleading."
1,Less than a star,Ugh! This book was so boring - I like to reread good books but gave this one away! Too many words to say not much of nothing. What a disapointment from a previously favorite author.
3,A season Beyond a Kiss,"I found this book hard to keep an interest in right from the start. I seems the first chapter belongs further down the story line. It was confusing to get the drift. Also, about 20 pages were put in upside down, which is probably a good indication of how this book was written. I did finish it, but it was not a book I could not put down and get around to later, which is usually not the way a book grabs me."
3,A Season Beyond a Kiss,"I love this author. She knows how to write a romance novel. This book was one of three in a series. I guess I just didn't want "" The Birmingham Saga"" to end. It was very slow and sickening sweet until mid book, then it picked up and you actually wanted to finish it."
2,Dull & Monotonous,"Okay, I am a Woodiwiss fan just like the next reader. However with this book, I think the villain is a ""unbelievable"" and an ""ineffective"" character. Its too bad this story is not a hot one that you can really sink your teeth into because Woodiwiss is a wonderful writer and I think her fans expect her novels to be a good read. Which comes to mind that I started reading this book way back in January of '02 and I still have not finished it because of its lack of depth. Meanwhile during this time, I've read close to 60 other books from cover to cover and this one is by far the dullest one I have ever read."
1,why? why ? why?,I AM STILL TRYING TO READ THIS BOOK.. I'VE HAD IT FOR OVER SIX MONTHS... I AM SOOOO GLAD THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST BOOK I READ OF KATHLEENE WOODIWISS......I JUST WANT TO KNOW IS WHY DID SHE NOT START FROM THE BEGINNING OF HOW THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS MET.... AND WHY WAS THE VILLAIN/STORY LINE SO WEAK? I WAS JUST SO SURPRISED THIS CAME FROM HER....(ARE WE SURE SHE WROTE THIS?)I HOPE SHE THINKS ABOUT REWRITING THIS BOOK..
1,Woodiwiss Beats A Dead Horse,"Okay, when an author starts penning goofball books like this one, it's time to put the pet protagonist family on the shelf. The Birminghams have outlived their novelty; this ""book"" is just a nightmare. I am angered to think that Woodiwiss is getting a paycheck off of name recognition and not because she's putting any real talent into her work. Granted, I have always disliked Woodiwiss and her caught-in-the-brambles kind of prose. But at least I could finish the other Woodiwiss novels I've attempted. This one is a travesty. Note to authors--know when to leave well enough alone and maintain your dignity. Excuse me while I go shower away this experience."
2,my review,"I was not impressed with this book when I first started to read it. I had read the previous book by this author and I had found it a good read.The story does not unfold immediately. The characters are not well introduced either. Only if you persist reading until the second half, can you really start to enjoy the story and the characters. At the end, the whole plot finally comes around and the characters become totally familiar, and that is when you appreciate the story who is actually well thought out."
2,What a bummer,"You know, I loved the Flame and the Flower, and couldn't wait to hear about Jeff! And it was a dissapoitment...I didn't like his wife either. I've gone back to read the Flame and the Flower again and hope to regain some of that ol' feeling!"
4,Almost back to old form,"I was relieved to see Woodiwiss could write a better book than Petals, yet this one was not quite up to Shanna or her other classics. Why write a book based on a short novella in a little-known series (unless prompted by editors), especially when it forces you to take your books out of sequence? I was so confused at first that I had to go back through her books and figure out who was who. The first half of the book plodded slowly, but halfway through, Kathleen found her rhythm and told a story I was finally interested in."
3,Continuing saga leaves reader wondering where story began-,"This story is not Kathleen Woodiwiss' best work but it could have been better if the sequel was not taken out of context. The author split up the story in three books: Three Weddings and a Kiss (The Kiss is the last short story), Married at Midnight (Beyond the Kiss is the last short story), and finally, A Season Beyond a Kiss. The first two short stories were an excellent beginning. However, the final book's first 200 pages were boring and repetitive. It seemed to try and catch the reader up to what was happening. In addition, it took forever to develop the true plot which was revealed almost near the end of the book.One thing I really loved, however, was the great ending. Kathleen Woodiwiss did have a little surprise at the end and it left me feeling much better about the book.I would like to see the author combine all 3 stories and remove about 100 pages. That book would receive a 4 from me."
1,"Skip this one, fans","I, too, was a long time fan of this author, never minding the long wait between novels. This book, however, is so poorly written as to be virtually unreadable. I forced myself through the first few chapters, but am unable to continue. Where is the buildup of tension that is so much a part of the romance genre? Where is the character development? I find myself not caring enough about these characters to finish the book - even if I could keep them all straight after the whirlwind introduction to them all in the first chapters. This review would be for ""zero"" stars if I was given the option!"
5,Does the job,I am a photographer and it does exactly what I need it to do. I have no problems with writing on it at all. Perfect for what I need.
2,Why the musical score isn't available,"As has been said, this is not the original score but is actually the audio version of the DVD. I emailed thesecret.tv to ask about the musical score and when/if/where it is available. Here is their response:""Thank you so much for your letter enquiring about the music used in TheSecret. The music was composed by a range of talented musicians who madetheir compositions available via their publishers for exclusive use infilm and television productions. These tracks are unfortunatelyunavailable to the public online or in a retail sense. Furthermore, thecomposers specifically exclude the licensing of their tracks outside offilm and television use, so that means we are unable to acquire rightsto release a soundtrack CD. I am sorry that I cannot bring you happiernews on this matter. All I can say is that going forward on all futurefilm releases, we plan to have music composed specifically so that wecan offer soundtrack CDs."""
4,SeaChoice Suction Light,This light is exactly what I needed for overnight trips out on my inflatable boat. Might be a bit on the cheap side as far as construction but it will do the trick.
5,the arginine solution,This is a fabulous book for anyone who is interested in enhancing their well being. It's packed with great information and I wish that it would go into print again so that I would be able to purchase it for friends and family members.
2,"Mortuary science student here, Very unimpressive book!","I too am a mortuary science student and used this book as a text book and let me tell you, this book sucked the life out of me! Pun intended. It's hard to follow and often I had to read and re-read sections while I scratched my head going ""say what"" as I went along. The book follows along with the history of undertaking and funeral directing all the way back to the Egyptians. I was so glad when the class was over I was ready to throw this book against the wall in frustration."
2,Great Book BUT Poor Quality Binding,"I have used a variety of Travel Guides (Moon, Footprint, Lonely Planet, Bradt, ...) and find that the Rough Guides are informative and give great background on a country, which put them on par with Bradt. But with this edition of the Rough Guide the pages started falling out immediately - on the plane. The binding is of a very poor quality, in which the pages are just glued to the cover. This is not acceptable for a guide book that will be used ""on the road"" compared to a book for fiction books.For this reason I would not recommend the guide book unless The Rough Guide fixes the binding."
5,Pure Elegance--Thirties Style,"I first heard the Ink Spots in the seventies when I got into big band. It was impossible to find their music then, and I listened eagerly on the radio. This CD illustrates the restorative magic that can be done with a competent remastering. It ain't stereo, but it's clear and true as only good mono can be! I wonder--do any black people listen to this music? I only know white people that like the Ink Spots. This music evokes elegance in the Roosevelt years. Like one of your other reviewers says, dim the lights, pour a drink, and enjoy!"
2,Very old episode,"Wished this series wasn't so expensive,at the time of buying this DVD, each DVD with 1 episode cost 20 dollars, which i thought was a bit too much since is an old series,i bought this Boston episode to complement a present for my husband who likes this series a lot,he watched once and completely forgot about it since it wasn't a very entertaining episode.thanks God i didn't purchase any more of these DVDs and instead used that money towards buying seasons of Law and Order."
5,Supprising Book! Great for all ages!,I am not a huge reader and it is hard to keep my interest in book. But when I picked up Annie I could not put it down!It is very easy to read and kept my interest every bit of the way. It is amazing how the book is told from Annie's (the dog) point of view.Imagine what the world would look like if you had four legs. Pick this book up and I promise you won't put it down. Every chapter has a new adventure!Enjoy!
1,Mindless Music For People With Money To Waste!,This records is so bad there are no words to describe it! On a scale of 1 to 5 stars I rate it -100!! It`s so obvious that this record was made for the money! There`s nothing in it to show just a slight intention for art.You have money to waste...for Christ`s shake don`t throw them bying this crap!! Burn them! Make a donation! Throw em in the street! but don`t waste em on this! Dump it straight to the garbage can!!
5,Breathtaking...,"Soulful, breathtaking, passionate, mysterious and mystical are all words that would accurately describe both Anna Vissi and this album. The artist's incredible voice coupled with the instrumentation make this CD a wonderful addition to any music collector's library!"
5,This is indeed their best,"I fully agree with the music fan from New York City - Rags to Rufus is indeed their best, and all the others (except Rufusized) quite disappointing! Rufus is one of those groups with one absolutely marvellous album that eclipses all their other work. (Other examples: Sparks with Kimono my House, Pointer Sisters with Special Things, Manfred Mann' with Solar Fire, Iron Butterfly with In a Gadda da Vida, King Crimson with Red)"
3,A little odd for Steppenwolf,"This is one of those albums that comes as an unexpected surprise to listeners, especially when it's a tough band like Steppenwolf covering such issues as...well..(look at the title!) It is perfect musically, although it is a bit uncomfortable, especially when you try to compare this to ""Born to be Wild"" type material. Goldy McJohn's piano solo in the title track saves the day."
5,One of the best books in the Fearless series.,"Gaia Moore has never experienced fear. Being fearless is what makes her unique -- and dangerous. But she's always wanted to have a taste of what fear is like. And when Loki offers her the chance to finally experience what it's like to be normal through a new drug, Gaia finds it hard to refuse. Although she doesn't trust Loki or Tom, she knows that Loki is the one who is giving her the freedom of getting away. But another thing she has to think about is Ed. Ed is the only person in the world who is her one true friend, and Gaia fears he may die soon because of her.She's already lost her mother, her friend Mary, and now Sam. And Gaia will do anything to stop his murder. Fearless #19: Twins is among the best in this thrilling series, keeping you in suspense until the end. It makes some changes in the series as well, and is well-written with a new twist of surprises. You won't be able to put it down."
1,Boring,I was not impressed with this book at all. it was a struggle just to finish the book. very disappointing
2,Disappointed,"I must have missed something. Everyone gave this book 4 or 5 stars; however, I can only give it 2 stars. I thought it was a very elementary read. Was this book geared toward a young adult audience, and I didn't know it? I expected a spooky ghost story, and yes, there was a ghost story, but in no way was this book scary or spooky. I was very disappointed with the ending of the book, as it really did not make much sense.I think a good reveal would have been to explain what happened to Meredith's parents. That whole scenario was kind of ambiguous. Did no one else feel this way? Or, maybe the truth of what happened to them is coming up in a sequel sometime in the future.I expected more and received less."
1,end of the line,"Okay, Shannon is a great writer ...BUT...his Jack Liffey character has become unreal. So politically correct that he is only overshadowed by his daughter who makes Shirley Temple look like the wicked witch from the west. For every stone unturned to reveal a snake this duo finds a butterfly waiting to be set free -by kindness and most of all - understanding. Apparently there is no evil, only non-understanding types (ie white, Christian and usually male). I got lost in DANGEROUS GAMES when Liffey meets up with the gang banger who shot his daughter and ends up wanting to teach him how to write an essay! All in the same few paragraphs. One can overcome plot problems if the writing keeps you entertained but when the characters become so unreal that you start laughing at them, then it's time to put the book aside. Sorry."
4,Wilde in the Countrye,"Amazon seems to have a different name listed for this album, which I own with the title of Wilde in the Countrye (all the same songs, maybe I have an import version?). I really like this one. Pretty classic, simple garage sound (mono recording adds to this effect). Some of the tunes really rip--edgy guitar, great bass. I Need You is a personal fave, and tracks 3 and 6 are great as well. Check it out."
1,children of the night / Maybe I'll come home in the spring,This video was poorly transfred from VHS to DVD. Children of the night picture was very dark through out the movie audio wasn't great. I could not even see many parts of the movie. The other feature Maybe I'll come home in the spring. The video was much better. But for the price I can't complain. Would not recommend buying this DVD.
1,Very Disappointing,I was so disappointed when I received this product. The shoes looked like they had been worn. They were advertised as new but certainly were not.
2,Not recommended.,"Arrived in good condition, and in timely manner. Used this for an airevac mission, and the case would spontaneously detach from the clip. Thankfully no damage was caused to the axim."
4,"TERRIFIC ""BRIT-COM""",IF YOU ENJOY THE HUMOR + AMUSEMENT OF BRITISH COMEDY THEN THIS IS RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY. YOU ARE TREATED TO A HILARIOUS VIEW OF THE VARIOUS PATRONS OF THE LOCAL PUB AS THEY COME IN AND SHARE THEIR DAILY STORIES WITH EACH OTHER AND YOU'LL WITNESS SOME FINE ACTING ALONG WITH EXCELLENT WRITING
3,History in the Making,"Listen to this CD, and hear history in the making. While this CD has a rough, garage-band sound, it also has undeniable power. The talent behind the music is obvious. Here is a chance to listen to some early versions of later classics (Power Play, Tighten Up Your Wig, Corinna, Corinna and The Pusher). The CD starts out with a slower, blusier version of Power Play than the one on Monster. Howling Wolf's Howling for My Baby is guaranteed to make you want to move, or at least to tap your foot. Another standout is a beautiful version of Corinna, Corinna that I believe is far superior to the version on Steppenwolf Live. It starts with an amazing guitar riff and also has a nice guitar break. The CD winds up with an extremely extended version of The Pusher, which is mostly just improvisation. Get this CD and here the beginnings of one of the most influential bands in rock. I have to admit to having a soft spot for this band - they were the first band I ever saw live."
4,A Good Game,"This Jurassic Park game is not based on any of the movies, but I recommend it because of a good plotline. Though it's a little overpriced, I can say it's worth it. It's a mixture of the original Jurassic Park adventure games and a classic arcade game. The object is to escape dinosaurs while collecting DNA samples that have been scattered all over the island of Isla Sorna because of a plane crash.That's when the puzzle portion of the game comes in: at the end of each level, you have to use the DNA you collected to create DNA strands.Graphics feature realistic-looking people and dinosaurs, a nice change to the pudgy things in other Game Boy titles.I can vaguely compare this game to JURASSIC PARK: SURVIVAL, which was supposed to be released as a Playstation 2 title but never was.The game features 12 levels and 10 dinosaur species, and I have to warn you, they're not too generous with lives. You only get one."
1,Dark- Impossible to see,"Well, I wish that I could write something positive about this game but I can't.The colors are so dark and the screen so busy that it is IMPOSSIBLE to play the game. Given the problems with the GBA screen brightness, one would think that Konami would design the game with that in mind. Well, they didn't. Neither my 6 or 8 year old can see the screen, and neither can I (albeit I'm slightly older..)Buy a game that you can see. Not this one."
1,DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME SUUUUUCKS DONT GET IT WHATEVER U DO!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Don't Have It Yet,Out of all the things I heard about this game it sounds like it must be really fun.
4,Jurassic Park 3 the DNA Factor,I think this is a great game. It is very challenging. The only bad thing about it is there is not enough action and to much puzzle solving.
4,Good info; a little hard to read,"This phrasebook accomplishes its task of providing a good selection of words and phrases for travel. The arrangement is fine and the pocket size appropriate, but because of the way the book is printed, it can be hard to read in low light. Some of the paper is light blue with the Italian words printed in white, and in the dictionary sections for translating words ""from"" one language ""to"" the other, the words in the ""to"" language are printed in blue on white paper. Fortunately, the phonetic spelling for the Italian is in black print. Some readers might want to take the readability into consideration."
4,Hildegard Von Bingen: O Jerusalem,"the music is so well done,and programmed so that the chant style does not grow old after listening to several tracks."
1,LMFAO,"First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release.But, what about the musicians? Sure, they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest. Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do, nevermind.)Enough of my rambling, how does this untalented group of posers fair up? Well, image if Mushroomhead went metalcore. 'Nuff said.Avoid."
5,Soulful harvest.,"Simply the best B.B. King's album. You can trust me because I do not like B.B. King at all for he has left the blues path to earn money. I cannot blame him for he was picking cotton as a child in the thirties!However, Riley B. King remains a fantastic musician and maybe one of the greatest guitar hero of the 20th century.Indianola Mississippi seeds is a positive soulful album; these cats are truly inspired. I own many records, all type of music; this one is in my topten!BGOCD 237 is the best release you can ever get even if it is more expensive. The sound is great, warm and clear, the strings are so beautiful. Sleeve, art and notes are fine either.This is my longest review but this music makes me fly.Enjoy this watermelon to the seeds and get thrilled!God bless you Riley B. King; I love you from now on."
1,It didn't work,"It simply didn't work. The CD didn't work, I downloaded a driver online but that didn't work either, because my computer couldn't even see the cellphone as connected.. I wish I didn't buy it."
1,Terrible Fountain,"I purchased this fountain a few months ago because I liked the look plus it had a feeding dish off the side. I loved it at first as did my cat. About a month later it started clogging up. I noticed the water getting dirty in the dish also after about a week. I have tried cleaning it, changing the filters every week and still it gets clogged. I finally threw it out and am looking for a new one. Congrats to those for whom it worked so well for, wish I would have had the same good luck."
5,Glad we have it.,This is our second one and each animal loves them. We have 2 dogs and 3 cats and they all have a favorite spot to drink from. Not that difficult to clean as my wife does it twice a week. I have no problem with that. LOL
1,waste of money,"spend your money on something that works. filling it is awkward because you fill it from the bottom by turning a spring loaded stick thing. we dropped the globe in the sind within the first month we had it, the plastic broke, and we had to replace it. the water does not look clean, even though there is a filter. and my cats would rather drink out of the dogs water dish than this thing. i am seeking an alternative."
2,"Neat, but not worth the trouble","We have had the Catit Fresh & Clear Drinking Fountain for a few months now...and while we thought it was a great idea, it turns out it's not worth the hassle. If the product doesn't have enough water in it is very noisy. We have to fill the reservoir up just about every other day. The cats seems to like it ok (we have 2 - 1 adult and 1 kitten) but they still prefer the toilet. Plus the cord on the Fountain is difficult to work with, they have a portion of the cord covered in plastic for protection but it's bulkiness makes it very difficult to hide or disguise. I also had a bit of trouble keeping it level and therefore had water flow problems. The filter doesn't seem to work very well either, and the entire thing is difficult to clean. Like I said...neat idea...but not worth the trouble and money. Our's has been retired to the closet."
4,Great Product,"This cat fountain is amazing! It's really quiet, holds alot more water than other fountain models, and is easy to clean. My 4 month old kitten took to the fountain right away and doesn't play in the fountain like she did her normal water bowl. The only downside is getting the water to circulate all the way around the globe. We found if we run our hands around the globe to break up the static eventually the water will make it's way all the way around.Looking forward to having this fountain a long time."
4,catit water bowl,Though this bowl may not be flawless. My cats and I have become very attached. They love the flowing water and this bowl requires much less maintenance than previous flowing water bowls i have had. My biggest issues would have to be the buildup of what i can only assume is lime scale. I have not yet found a way to reduce that build up or to remove it. Other than that it is a wonderful water supply for my two cats. The cleaning is yes a little more time consuming than just rinsing out a water bowl but what would you expect when you have a motor involved?
5,My cat loves it,"I got this for my cat not knowing if she would even come near it but after a couple of hours she loved it. She is drinking a goodly amount of water now, whereas before she really didn't like the static bowl of water.With just the one cat I fill it up once a week and and give it a good scrubbing at that time. Not really an issue with me that I have to. I take the pump apart every other time and clean it real well and I haven't had the problems others have.For my cat this was a good buy. Your mileage may very."
4,Deploying average-boy-from-street absolute mainly-men's ordinariness,I had never heard/seen this band and their tunes hard to remember also it left a positive impression while watching and listening to sometimes-psychotic gigs of a band unknown to.What is really good is a sharp highlighting of a visual performing talent with performers' average-boy-from-street absolute mainly-men's ordinariness.
4,A faithful reissue,"This s an exact replica of the 1956 LP soundtrack, only now it is in true stereophonic sound. George Duning's score is unique and sticks in the memory. The marriage of ""Moonglow"" and the ""Love Theme"" (from the dance scene) is a masterpiece and will stimulate in your mind the visuals which it accompanies. The sound is quite good considering the age of the tape masters."
1,Ehh...,"This is a good game... for 5 minutes. It is just pacman..Nothing special. The arcade version is much better. Although the price for this is cheap, its not worth the 3.99 shipping."
2,Not worth the money,I was not pleased with this item. It didn't fit my computer screen but I tried to use it anyway. It did not stop the glare.I felt like the glare was even worse than before.They did respond with super fast shipping though.
3,"What there is , is great","Initially going through the book, its full of excellent ideas and information, all the things you want to know about the Underdark. It was only when I started to look things up , I found that there was no index. How can a reference book have no index! Then after reading through the geography section trying to find what I was looking for I noticed , half the paces on the map have not enteries, which was quiet frustrating.Overall, what there is is excellent, but it seems like the only wrote half the book."
4,"Wrong item, mistakenly.","I honestly thought I was purchasing the DVD when I bought this item. What a shocker when I got it! (I should read better. It was in black and white that it was an audio CD). None-the-less, I popped it in the CD player and was pleasantly surprised! It's a great CD with awesome songs and singers. Happily mistaken."
2,A Tivo Stinko,"I was watching this movie as a Tivo recording when suddenly, to my infinite relief, I realized I could stop the pain by turning it OFF! It was hokey beyond belief, which I suppose is why the actors blatantly did not believe in themselves or their world.I have a feeling I'm missing some sort of movie-musical point here, and god knows ""They Call the Wind Maria"" is exquisite, but this movie was an orgy of cornballs shoved in all the wrong places.Buy the songs, skip the movie."
4,Another Madden Re-hash?,".... Anyway, the presence of recruiting alone in NCAA Football makes the game a must have for any true football gaming fan. Also, with regard to the size of the players in the game, the players were bigger in the PS2 in M2K1, hence they will almost assuredly be the same size (or close to it) in NCAA2K2. All in all, any fan of the previous NCAA titles or of the Madden titles (how can you not be?) should definitely pick this game up. IT IS A MUST HAVE!!! (I never give a game 5 stars, there isnt a perfect game out there...I would give this a 4 1/2 or 4 3/4 stars though, even w/o playing it...based on playing the previous games and playing Madden 2K1 for the PS2)"
5,Near Perfection,"After 10 years of playing various football video games the moment has finally come when the AI, graphics, post season activity is so incredible that it makes me want to quit my job and live in the world of the game. This is the game I dreamed of when I was playing the original version of Madden on my sega. The only corrections for next year would be that it's difficult to punt and the player's heads aren't in proportion to their bodies on some screen shots. What a game! Every college football fan should own. Go ASU Sundevils."
4,just what I was looking for,I think this book can really help you a lot if you're trying to get that job you've always wanted.I'm just leaving school and I needed a guide like this!This book present you a simple way of doing it and it works...even in my country.
2,Soundtrack,This wasnt as good as i hoped it would be.Im glad i bought i but thought it fell short of good.
3,Not something I could watch every day.,"If you liked Yes Sir I Will, you'll like this video, if not don't get it.It is a compilation of all of the soundclips(along with a few songs from yes sir i will) on CRASS's albums with video footage to go with them. Definitly not an every day movie, but it's one of those things that's nice to watch every once in a while to make your head spin."
4,Expected more,"From the picture I thought I was purchasing 2 spools of thread, when in fact it was only one. The fault of course lies with me for not reading more than I did. The thread is perfect, received very quickly with regular shipping, I use this thread all the time and will probably order it again from Amazon in the future."
5,"Best Thread, Best Value","I'm not sure why all the other reviewers are saying this thread is ""so expensive"" It's definitely the best value out there. You pay more because you are getting MORE thread on the spool. I run a small online business selling my handmade decor pillows and go through spools and spools of thread. This is the best out there!"
5,will the real JH please stand up?,"Ok, the recording industry wanted another Elvis Costello, and produced Hiatt to be a contender. That's a problem, except that John was the number one contender. Listening to this in perspective of his life's work since, you can hear the real JohnHiatt in there, nobody's imitator, but kinda steered that way. Midwestern babyboomers note : Appleton WI's Doug Yankus,(d'82), (from the band ""Soup"", c'68), plays guitar throughout on this , (and ""Hangin' Out at the Observatory"")."
5,Excellent Album,"I have a number of sonatas from Essercizii Musici on various CDs that I own, but this is the first time that I have ever seen the complete set on one release.If you have never listened to Telemann, or are looking to expand your knowledge of him, this is a great place to start. G.P. Telemann wrote these sonatas masterfully, and you get the full range of moods, tempos, and instrumentation from them. His melodies are beautiful and enjoyable to listen to, and they're filled with enough intricate counterpoint that you hear something new every time you listen.If you're a die-hard baroque fan, this collection is worth its weight in gold. This four-disc boxed set is excellent on all accounts -- sound quality, performance, etc.I am completely happy with my purchase, and would recommend this recording to anyone who has even a passing interest in chamber music."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this looking forward to a great recording of the wonderful music of O'Carolan, but the sound quality is so uneven it's almost impossible to listen to. If you turn up the volume enough to hear the first cut, you'll be blasted out of your chair by the second. Too bad..."
1,Not Worth the Star I was forced to pick,I tried really hard to read this book. I just couldn't do it. Maybe it's just me. I am an avid reader but I just couldn't get past the second chapter. Please borrow this one from a friend. You will be very upset if you buy this book.
2,One Star for the cover and One for the story,This read was extremely boring not even worth taking out of the library. I was fooled by the cover.
4,"BEAUTIFUL COVER, GREAT TITLE","HOT JOHNNY is a good read, a little confusing, with a few too many players. It's not exactly a novel, but a collection of remembrances by females (family and former friends and lovers). This story is told out of sequence to accommodate a mystery, then its solving.While reading each woman's story about Johnny, a little more of him is revealed, until all of the parts join together like a beautiful quilt work to show the full, complicated man.Because there was very little connection between the characters (they were all connected to Hot Johnny), it was easy to put this book down between chapters.Ms SJ-O is definitely talented, a different and refreshing type of writer. One can only imagine the tremendous effort put into this well-written book."
5,imafan,"Lisa Bevere spoke at a women's conference I attended last month and I fell in love.She is so real and has such wit that you can't help but to be intrigued by her. WhatIike best about this book is it walks you through a journey with God of placing valueon yourself. Without seeing our value as women, we won't fulfill everything God hasfor us on this earth...we will fall short. Lisa obviously has not fallen short and sheis a woman after God's own heart...a women I would allow speak into my life any time."
4,Cute & stylish,"The cups arrived in good time, very well packaged with bubble wrap. They are very cute, dainty even & very stylish. I wouldn't man-handle these as they're not for that. Great for a lady with tea, coffee or orange juice sipping casually."
5,Super cute,"My kitty loves to get inside of bags, boxes, etc, so I thought I would get her a bed she could hide inside of. She loved it immediately and enjoys playing with the toy ball inside when she's not sleepy. Roomy enough for about a 9 pound cat."
5,We love this.,"Our Snowshoe cat naps in here every day, and occasionally the big Siamese boy tries to get with her, but that's a tight squeeze. It seems cozy and warm, and has held up well for the past year."
4,Cute and Comfy Boots,"These boots are cute, comfy and versatile. The color is perfect. They were slightly snug but not uncomfortably so. I usually wear a 6 and ordered a 6."
5,Horribly Brilliant,"This is an excellent summary of the Potato (note that spelling, Danny-Boy-O Quayle) Famine that plagued Ireland from 1845-1850, when the fungus Pythophthora Infestans destroyed the staple crop. Author Susan Campbell Barttoletti deftly explores the swirling pathological, sociological, political, and theological soup caused by the rotting potatoes and the aftermath. She relies on original sources and interviews with descendants of the resultant Diaspora. This book is found in the children's section of the library, but frankly, I found it hard to read myself - not because the words or concepts are difficult, but because it is so very grim - the horror! the horror! /TundraVision, Amazon reviewer."
1,What?!,"This book is not manga not at all. The art is way to chidish and cartoony. If you want to learn real manga try the ""How to draw more manga"" book by Katy Coope.It teaches how to draw manga monsters and people. Plus it is real art not these cartoons by Mr.Hart!"
4,Judgement Day.... and all were judged......,"UFC XII stars ""The Brazilian Sensation"" Vitor Belfort in his first UFC appearance, Scott ""The Pitbull"" Ferrozzo, Tra ""Trauma"" Telligman, ""Lion's Den Fighter"" Jerry Bohlander, ""Pankration Sensation"" Yoshiki Takahashi, Dan ""The Beast"" Severn, Mark ""The Hammer"" Coleman, and more. Can Vitor live up to the hype? Tank Abbott actually complimented him, you make the decision... Two master grapplers in Severn and Coleman challenge each other for the coveted UFC belt. Almost perfect, almost.........."
5,A practitioner's guide,"Excellent guide for practitioners. Instead of regurgitating the JMS spec, Shaun focuses on architectural as well as design issues related to JMS. Shaun has distilled his wealth of knowledge on this subject developed through Java Center engagements in this book. Don't miss it."
5,Love Story In Harvard,I loved this movie. It is a great love story and the characters who are in love with each other are together more than not.
4,inventive...,"this album is a bit like lo-fi hip hop turned into almost complete songs, with cool tunes and unpretentious singing. I like this album a lot, no idea if its still in print. listen to the samples above of ""au pair"" and ""Strained 'n' drained"" to get an impression of what it sounds like. very original album."
5,Asthma? Allergies? READ THIS BOOK!,I've had allergies all of my life and first experienced allergy induced asthma about 10 years ago. This book has changed my life!! I rarely use an inhaler and allergy medicine anymore after everyday use!! I highly recomend this!! Jackie from Jersey
4,A great pocket PC case,"I needed a case that support my Compaq IPAQ 3135 and the expansion jacket for protect the screen of the device. This case works fine, but is a little bulky with the IPAQ with the jacket inside. The space for business cards and memory cards is very narrow, take time to put them inside the case.The leather is good.It took me a while find a case with enoght space to support the device with the jacket, so I am glad to bought it because solved my origin problem."
5,great!,works as the product promises. i run a lot and feel less frustrated! i apply it to my inner thighs.
5,Great Fogger,I purchased another fogger about 15 years ago and it finally died. This was exactly what I was looking for. Fast delivery and it save the cookout from the bugs outside. Highly recommend.
3,Good...or...not???,"When I first got home from the store, I happily tore the rapping off of my game. I liked it for awhile, but then I got stuck, I know some of you out there are saying to yourselfs ""Just cause you can't figure it out doesnt mean that I can't!"". Well I wish I could be as ""smart"" as all of you because I found the game to be VERY HARD! Don't get me wrong, it is a very fun game...until...you reach a puzzle. At just about evey puzzle I got to I had to call the help line. WHen i got the answers to the puzzle they werent even what i thought they would be. So all I have to say is, if you like sitting and stareing at your tv for hours trying to figure out the answers, then buy it, but if you are just a regular gamer then leave the next copy you see at the store there for somebody else cause it's ""criptic puzzles"" arent for everybody. So all in all i thought the game was um... let me think...well...NOT GOOD. So i gave it a 3/5 stars."
3,The original's feel is sacrificed for mass market appeal,"The first Parasite Eve was my favorite Playstation game ever, and I bought the second one on the strength of the original. Unfortunately, I found that much of the creepiness of the story and intuitiveness of the controls had been sacrificed for a more commercial ""X-Files meets Resident Evil"" kind of game.On the positive side, the clunky weapons system is replaced, and the replayability factor is high. Although the story is still very linear, you can make choices that alter the story (and the ending) somewhat.You can read other reviews for details on the story and style; I simply wanted to note that if you really liked the original, this is a bit of a letdown."
2,What was Squaresoft thinking?,"When I played the first Parasite Eve, I couldn't wait for the sequel. When it came out, I ran out and got it right away. I got home and put it in my Playstation. I loved the graphics, but why did Aya get all muscular for no reason? I wanted Aya to stay in New York and stay with Daniel, Maeda, etc. But instead she was in Los Angeles with people who hardly help in the game at all, I played the game, hoping it would get better, but the storyline was really messed up, the graphics were excellent, but Aya's controls were all confusing. I think this would be a good game to rent, but don't waist your money buying it."
1,not a good game,"i just recently purchase parasite eve 2 for 20 dallars and i didn't really like the game the first 20 minute of playing, i say that the cutcsence(movie)was preety awsome,i didn't play thou the whole game to know the storyline.. and i was surrprised bout the fcs, but i didn't like it because, to me i think it is trying to be like resident evil,and they realy did something with the control's (character movement) it was hard to control her. (the turning). how the characterlook it's alright, the text i didn't like,i mean compare this to the first parasite eve game. it's a whole lot better than parsite eve 2. wut a waste of my 20 dallar's"
3,Why did they mess up a good thing?,"In the first Parasite Eve the fighting system was wonderful and easy to get the hang of, though still challenging. While this second edition to the series had an equally superb plot, cut scenes, and game play, the fights in this game ruin just about every moment. Instead of enjoying the game for the beauty of what it was, most of my time was yelling strings of bad language at the television screen as I died for the fifth time because of the bad controls and hard to handle fighting. Sometimes there is such a thing as leaving well enough alone, and that's what they should have done with their first fighting system and controls."
4,out of print? try Amazon,"A friend of mine wanted a copy of this prayer book and couldn't find it anywhere.I asked Amazon and within 3 days, she had it. Happy experience"
4,East Coast Dreams Box Set,"This is a collection of really great music. A lot of the tracks are done by the Safari Sound Band, which is kinda like the Kenyan version of the Beach Boys. Classic tracks include Jambo...the welcome to Kenya song and a great track which translates ""you are my lion."" It's a must have for any fan of old school Kenyan music"
4,I was inverted... I mean converted.,"Long Drive is my first exposure to Modest Mouse, and I think it's a brilliant CD. ""Dramamine"" (cited in several other reviews as a favorite) is also one of my favorites--Modest Mouse has a sound that cannot aptly be described in a review. And while the band *is* reminiscent of the genius and sometimes oddly frenetic works of Frank Black, the Minutemen, et al., they add enough of their own raspy emotion to create a style and work of their own.Other songs that I suggest checking out: ""Breakthrough,"" ""Custom Concern,"" ""Lounge,"" and ""Talking Shit about a Pretty Sunset."""
5,BREAKTHROUGH,"Upon first listening to this BREAKTHROUGH recording the unsavy listener MIGHT dismiss Modest Mouse as unworthy of holding down a LOUNGE gig on some BEACHSIDE PROPERTY. This is not a ""verse-chorus-verse band"". This listener feels that ""the Mouse"" is the best thing to come on to the music seen in the last part of the 20th century. Although they employ tremendous dynamics a la *the Pixies*, beautiful melodies riding on rock steady basslines, and stirring drum work Modest Mouse unfortunately will not MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY. If you are interested in hearing some emotionally driven, innovative, and honest music then get yourself a copy of any Modest Mouse recording today. Otherwise HEAD SOUTH to Blahvue."
2,Beyblade,"My son (9yrs old) really wanted this toy after playing at a friend's house. Apparently the accessory that makes them worthwhile is the Beyblade arena (which I tried to order from Hasbro.com - Amazon has a link to this, but was advised it was out of stock), so we haven't really gotten to play with the toy. Ordering the beyblades without having the arena has been a big disappointment.My son says the toys are hard to asssemble (Japanese instructions) and not fun to assemble like Legos. He would prefer it came pre-assembled.This product does not seem that durable or worth the money."
4,WHAT A GAME,The graphics are awesome. Madden offers alot of different game modes and eclipses Madden 2000. The only disadvantage is that you can't have 3 team trades. Great Buy!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,Do not buy this item . It is too hard .I only played it for a couple minites it was so hard and boring .(...)
5,a terrific find,"I have recently been studying Jainism and stumbled across the recordings of Rajaudio in a titles listing. I was so excited I had 6 titles in my cart before I knew it, but then decided I would be more cautious and choose one to start with and hope for the best. I was absolutely blown away by how much I enjoyed this album. Both the players and vocalists give a feeling of ""classical"" Indian music but bring it up to date with some shining extras. I will definitely be buying those albums I didn't get the first time around, and probably more. If you enjoyNiyaz,Kiran Ahluwalia's self titled album, Shree Maa'sShiva Is in My Heart, Gypsy Caravan'sQuest, or the more tribal sound of Solace'sRhythm of the Dance, this is an album for you."
2,Not So Good,"I've played all the Nascar Games and this is a step back. The graphics are not good, and there are no other improvements over the setup of Nascar 2000. In fact Nascar 2000 is a better game. I recommend Jarrett @ Labonte Stock Car Racing for the true racer, but forget about Nascar 2001."
4,astonishing deal that you simply shouldn't pass up,"Even though that most people will overlook this game because it's a PlayStation game that's a re-release of a 16-bit game during a time when we've already moved on to the 128-bit generation, if you're an RPG fan that has yet to play either of these classics, it's a must-have title. With the multiple endings and fantastical game design and lovable characters, Chrono Trigger alone is worth the full price of admission. Add in Final Fantasy IV and you have an astonishing deal that you simply shouldn't pass up. Jody Bissoon"
5,Pleasently Suprised,"I wasn't expecting too much coming from this FF title, mainly because I never really hear anything about it. People always rave about 6, 7, 10, etc...but you don't hear much about 4. I bought it because I wanted to own every FF game, and just figured I would think the game was okay, or ""good"" at best.Turns out this game was a lot of fun. It's my favorite pre-PS1 FF game. The characters are diverse, the story is interesting, and it's just a very fun game over all."
5,PS1-Final Fantasy Chronicles (Chrono Trigger/FSIV),"I have not played Chrono Trigger for years. It is quite the game. The controls are easy to use. If you played it once long ago, do it again. I recommend it. Good buy too. Two games for the price of one. I have not started Final Fantasy IV yet. I will give it a go when I finish Chrono Trigger. Have fun."
3,Chrono Trigger is the only good thing,"I was very disappointed with the ""remake"" of FFV. I expected better graphics and gameplay but it was just the same game for a new system. The only thing that makes chronicles the least bit worthwhile is Chrono Trigger."
2,Thorough but Unkind,"While this biography of the Duchess of Windsor is more than thorough, it occasionally lapses into a gossipy pettiness that makes for uncomfortable reading. Some personal details are better off left unrelated and their inclusion makes the work squirmingly voyeuristic as well as a slow read. For me, it would be enough to know the historical connections and experiences of this couple without delving into their sexual techniques, their lapses in courtesy, and their embarrassing personal foibles. It simply seems that a bit of common civility could have made this work much more readable and enjoyable."
4,just what i was looking for,"perfect size to carry around...haven't put it to work yet, but I'm sure it's going to come in handy when trying to find a bus in the streets of Brazil!"
3,Ed and Gaia's Early Morning Together,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! finally, ed and gaia have the most amzing morning together! i've been waiting so long for this...but as usual, gaia had to think too much and she ruins the relationship. that's when i wanted to throw the book against the wall because i cannot get enough of ed and gaia! and it makes me so mad that she would break his heart like she does. but i'm hoping, if i stay dedicated to this series, that everything will work out for them."
2,Displeased.,"I really liked a lot of its features as it WILL recognize folders and allow you to skip between albums very easily. But what the crap, try doing a random on it and it automatically cuts off 5 seconds of every mp3 as it jumps to the next song.How could they be that stupid when they put the thing together?"
1,Don't waste your money....,"Better spend your money or a massage or a gym membership, because this product will not help you solve your problem.I am so sorry I wasted my money on it, and who knows what's in it (says ""proprietary blend"")."
4,Maximum Conviction Steven Seagal,"This is a better than average Seagal pic.... the pairing of Seagal and Steve Austin is terrific. A decent story line as well. Seagal's ""acting"" is what it is!!!---but a great supporting cast that helps carry this movie. For Seagal fans this movie is worth getting...."
3,Seagal movie...not much I can critisize,"You generally get what you deserve when buying a Seagal movie. This time he had some help from another action figure and he does that a lot....Steven is getting a little too much age and weight on him to handle an action movie on his own, so I don't blame him. I probably have most of his movies and like a lot of his fans, we keep waiting for the great one to have a five star movie....oh well."
4,"Hey, it's Steven Seagal","I am a Steven Seagal fan, so I enjoyed it, If you like the genre you'll enjoy this movie. Definitely not a chick flick"
5,Just as I remembered,"I grew up loving Bobby Sherman, My dad bought me ""With Love Bobby"" for my 12th birthday. I turned 50 this year. It really took me back. I love it."
4,Like I remember it,"Overall good music. Although I never saw him perform back in the 70's, I did get the chance to see him in a nostalgia tour about 5 years ago. He stilled looked good in leather pants and still sang pretty well."
3,Confusing messages in storyline,"Wicked was a good read, but a disappointing storyline. The author created Sophia to be bold and headstrong, sent her to a warrior to train, and then the only use she had for this training was to publicly humiliate her husband. Nowhere is she allowed to let her inherent personality traits be used for good. She is always being rebuked for them. Lesson conveyed: grow up, settle down and behave. Not what I expected from the description before purchase."
5,"Great book, just buy it!","Like I said, just buy this book. There is a ton of information that you won't get from your everyday MD or Chiropractor. Dr. Johnson knows what he's talking about."
1,"Easy to see the bias, right from the start","Heavily biased, no real content. Cherry picked media out takes make ridiculous attempts to spin what really happened. Wouldn't really recommend for serious watching."
4,A good look at media,"My main takeaway lesson from this video is that each of us should take personal responsibility in vetting the facts we hear from the media, particular as we have a vast wealth of information at our fingertips. Check and double-check facts before casting your vote!"
1,NOT FOR ROYAL ENFIELD G5,"Buy the right one at OREILLY AUTO PARTS FOR $3.50, Save time & money! This one, although sharing the same part number, will not work in an Enfield G5."
4,Nice towel,"Very nice towel, very comfy, absorbs a lot and color is great, I love it! Highly recommend purchase of this product."
4,Great Perfromance of the 4th but...,"This is probably the best performance of the 4th Symphony that I've ever heard. Too bad that someone put a big 6 second pause between the 3rd and 4th movements on the CD (the original LP sidebreak was in the same spot). Otherwise, this would have been pretty close to ideal."
4,It works!,This little gizmo works for me. It transfers easily from bag to bag and is flexible enough to hug my shoulder and keep the bag in place!
4,SLAM DUNK!!!,"This is a very thrilling and exciting game even if your not a fan of basketball. for 2001 it has very good graphics and a lot of differnet modes including 1 on 1,exhbition and 3point shootout!This is fun for all ages."
3,Traditional Stories Retold for not every Gay Man,"The puns are very dated and some of the stories do not hold up well today. I had higher hopes when I had ordered this book, and feel it is a bit too heavily shaded with nods to the S&M lifestyle. However some of the stories that do not rely heavily on the mention of condos and stereotypes are extremely well done."
2,Not terrifically sophisticated,"I have nothing against unsophisticated books, in fact I actually quite like children's books. But if a book is for adults, and advertised as such, I like a certain level of complexity and originality. This book isn't bad, but it doesn't offer anything which isn't already done; and is virtually transparent in terms of predictability. It is, however, at least partially, saved by a slight twist in that the author took a slightly different direction in terms of the solution to the main problem than has been seen in other novels like 'Decipher' by Stel Pavlou. Unfortunately it still doesn't even compare when stood next to books like this. It's not awful, I'll give it that; but it was regrettably a hairsbreadth from becoming so. I might be judging it harshly though, because I'm actually really fond of the sort of genre it went for (a sort of science fiction where the focus is on believable science) and so get a little picky in what I expect out of a book which goes for it."
1,Not my cup of tea,"The style of writing could not hold my interest. After several comments, describing what some character-s hair was doing, I was too bored too care."
4,Ice Tomb,"Ice Tomb - A nice read, definate page turner. Just when you think you have figured it out another twist, alittle more info to keep you quessing. Hope Deborah Jackson writes another."
2,Meh,"If you like books about lost Atlantic super-civilizations with super-powers, welcome a heroine who spends a good deal of her time obsessing about her emotional life, and have a deep dislike of the military, then this is the book for you. For the rest of us : meh. By the half-way mark, when the plot descended from the odd to the absurd and just plain silly, I began to skip through the pages hoping for some improvement. By the 75% mark I gave up completely. Thank the stars it was cheap."
4,The title cought me.,"ice tomb started fast and kept at it till the last event, the characters were complex enough to keep you interest. So many stories have vague people that do not hold your interest. My Kindle is great for this kind of story, goes with me where ever I go. No lapses in the story line."
1,Totally unrelatable story and characters,"While this book started out OK and with an interesting idea (archaeology in the Antarctic) it soon turns into a really bad read. First there are some SEALs, which are portrayed like they don't have a brain at all (i.e. shooting at US citizens without any reason, then they are called off by NASA and then they try to kill the Americans again). Then there is the pseudo science, which lacks in so many areas that it's too much to bear - just some examples: string theory is explained as everything working like music, a quantum computer looks like a big pyramid and people just know that it's a quantum computer by looking at it, etc. Last but not least the characters have no depth at all and behave extremely irrational in many situations...Save your money and look for a better SF read - there are many out there."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I love the premise of this book. I don't mind the stretches of imagination the story requires. The problem that I have is in the writing and editing. There are several problems that leap out at you right away. The dialog needs work. While there is the start of some good witty repartee, it seems that is the only way characters in this book interact. The author needs to dial that back a bit and provide some basis for the characters to engage like that. Whie I like the characters, they need to be introduced slower, and you need to be given some understanding of them before you can care about them. Some of the primary characters act quite childish and incredibly emotional. There are few well balanced personalities evident, and that makes it are to relate.I think this is a good raw start of a book in need of a strong professional editor."
1,You'll be sorry...,"There are so many good books out there. This is not one of them. This reads like a manuscript never edited properly. The character's are ridiculous the way they act for their education and intelligence. I had to force myself to keep reading in hopes the plot, which was great, ... Would eventually come to fruition. Only get his book if you can stand Jeckle and Hyde personality changes in several characters.Consider yourself warned.."
3,Good Story Line,"It was a great story line but as written, inclusing the description of events, it came across as too immpossible. I understand it is Science Fiction but portrayal of the charachters was unrealistic. More like comic book reading."
3,Eh,"Nice and inventive story. Unfortunately I found the writing style a bit repetitive and amateurish.People ""biting their lower lip"", etc..."
1,Eh.....,"The story was great, but the writing was very....uh....young. The characters lacked depth and maturity. I could see one or two immature characters, but ALL of them? For supposedly professional and well educated people, they behaved very unprofessionally and in a very reactionary way which never would have been tolerated in the positions they were in or the situations in which they found themselves. The whole story was entirely unbelievable. But the concept was interesting."
3,Women aren't that trite,"Enjoyed the read, BUT really didn't like how the female lead was portrayed. She was supposed to be a professional woman Not a single professional woman I know wouldbehave in the manner this character did. It is an insult to all women. But if you can suspend your disbelief it is interesting"
4,It was a good read,"If you like SciFi, you'll like this book. The author is a good writer. She is able to give a sense of place, whether writing about Antarctica or the moon. She lost a star because she had the Atlantians frozen in the ice dressed in Inuit clothing (read the book!)."
5,Must Buy!,"New Edition's self-titled second album is a must buy! Move over BSB and new groups! There's never going to be another New Edition!! Whether you're into the more up-beat songs like ""Kinda Girls We Like"" and ""My Secret,"" or the ballads such as ""Maryann,"" ""Girl I'm Leaving You Again,"" or the hit ""Lost In Love,"" there is something on this album for everybody... Check it out!!"
1,This is NOT a replacement for the Catit Fresh and Clear Drinking Fountain,"I ordered this, even though there was not much information provided. For one thing the description said these were ""For use with the Catit Drinking Fountain"". I could not tell from the description if there were one or three filters and the photo was so small and unclear when I looked, I could not really tell that the picture was supposed to be a representation of the shape of the filter. In short this is the wrong product for me. These are replacement filters for the Catit Fresh and Clear Drinking Fountain with Food Bowl. The description should say this more clearly. It's useless for the Catit Fresh and Clear Drinking Fountain."
2,Misleading Title by Seller,"The title of the seller's auction said, ""Size 3 PACKS OF 3 FILTERS (TOTAL 9)"". I only received 1 pack with a total of 3 filters - not 9 as it stated! I would be willing to give this seller a second chance if he was to send me the additional 6 filters that I paid for. Seller?"
4,Good Filters,"The filters work great, just as they should. I only received 1 box of 3 filters at first so I sent them an email asking them why, and they sent out the other 2 boxes."
5,Does its job,These work exactly as they should with the fountain they were made for. We have been using these for over 6 months and have had no problems.
5,Very dependable Filter,"I have one fountain and 4 cats that use it. It does a good job of keeping the water fresh and clean, especially since one likes to use it to wash his feet."
4,"Brilliantly beautiful piano concerto, slightly less brilliant on the solo piano stuff","The Yellow River Piano Concerto is a lovely and (at risk of belaboring the word) BRILLIANT concerto, with obviously (or at at least to stereotype) Chinese characteristics to the music. Far more melodic than much of 20th century music. For my taste, it was way too short (about 21 minutes); a perfect show-biz finale, left me begging for more. Still, this one work makes the whole CD worth buying.The other works on the CD were all for solo piano, an enjoyable listen but a let-down after that concerto. I should add the disclaimer that it's hard for *me* to listen too long to the playing of a single instrument, even one as versatile as the piano, so my own judgements on the solo piano work are arguably a mere quibble."
1,Weak!,"I'm glad I caught the review by ""Armchair Rambo"" who claims this is The Fall's weakest effort. Several people have raved to me about how great the Fall is. I finally grabbed one of their disks on a whim and it was this one. To be frank, this album sucks. I don't hear any musical talent or decent tunes here at all. It attempts to be sort of ""underground New Wave."" After a few painful attempts to get into this record, I had to get rid of it. But thanks to ""Armchair Rambo,"" who wrote the following review, I'll be giving The Fall another try."
5,One of the top 3 books on the subject I've seen,"The most frustrating thing about this book, is that it is no longer in print. That doesn't make sense to me. Never has this subject been so entertaining as when I read it from this. It is one of the top 3 books I've ever seen on the subject. Apsolutely wonderful."
3,"Good, but not as good as others","We bought this one because our 9-month-old just loves her Baby Einstein Old MacDonald DVD and the other Baby Einstein giant touch-and-feel book, ""Violet's House."" While ""Violet's House"" has relevant and many touch and feelies on each page, this one only has one per page and the feelies aren't anywhere near the actual feel of the animal. (i.e. the pig feely is plastic bristles.) The chicken feely is feathers, although relevant to the animal, they do come off easily.We were so impressed by ""Violet's House"" and the DVD that we expected a little more quality. It is also very wordy for each page instead of more simple reading, which should be targeted for this age group."
1,Waste of my money,The product is considered non-stick. The eggs stuck to the cups and cleaning the cups took a while. Even soaking the cups didn't help. I bought these to avoid spending money on a $50.00 pan and poucher set but it wasn't worth it.
2,Short on Quality,The pegs on this toy are longer then the legs so when they are hammered down they hit whatever the toy is resting on at the time. Did not work well with the coffee table as my granddaughter blasted away trying to drive the pegs all the way down. Looks like this company is short on quality control....
1,Very disappointed,"We ordered this for my 2 year old son for Christmas. I was excited for him to get it as he loved to hammer. What a disappointment! The holes are so loose that the peg almost drops through on its own. There is no resistance at all for the hammer and no challenge. When you pick it up, the pegs drop out. I read the reviews before buying, but decided to give the toy the benefit of the doubt because its a Melissa and Doug toy. I wish I had believed the reviews now. Total waste of money. :("
3,Great Product,My son really enjoyed this product. The only difficult he has is that the pegs are too difficult for him to pound down.
2,just okay,"we purchased this for our 1 year old and she loves it. while the wood is certainly durable, the plastic ring inserts within the holes of the block are too loose for the pegs. This causes the pegs to slip through too easily. Good idea for a toy but ours wan't made real well."
1,Mine broke too,"I was really excited about the idea of this toy because I remember loving the old fashioned ones when I was a kid... but the other reviews are correct. The pegs are so loose they practically fall through the holes, and the head of the mallet cracked in half on the second day of use by my 18 month old daughter who seriously was barely hitting the pegs."
1,TOTAL CRAP!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!! Hammer fell apart within minutes of opening package. Hammer wasn't even used yet! Pegs just fall thru. I imagine the plastic piece that's supposed to hold pegs in will fall out too, causing a choking hazard. Total piece of crap and waste of money! We will not keep it long enough to see what else falls off of it! I would give this no stars if I could!"
3,believe the reviews.,"the pegs and holes are varying sizes (some pegs work in all holes, some are too small for most of the holes but will work in one or two, some pegs won't fit in some holes but fit in others. Maddening!) I have one peg that's too narrow for all the holes that I put some tape around to increase the thickness. Now the red sides keep falling off. I keep re-gluing them with wood glue but it doesn't hold. I may put screws in through the side but that will affect the appearance. But my kids love the toy. Wish the pegs didn't come out, am tired of hunting for them around the house. Our hammer didn't fall apart but the wood splintered around the corners. I picked as much off as I could but it's still ugly. I don't think my kids were particularly hard on it. I usually like m&d toys but this one is one of the few exceptions."
2,Needs more concise construction,Liked the idea of an old toy my own children liked to play with and I ordered this for a great grandchild but this toy disappointed me because several of the pegs would fall out without being hit. Some pegs fit well but 3 of them were loose and just fall through the holes and are always lost. We tried rearranging the pegs in different holes but the same pegs would fall through all the holes.
1,PRODUCT RECALLED,Any of these sold between November 2008- November 2009 have been recalled![...]From one parent to another I just wanted people to know!
1,Didn't need a hammer and fell apart.,I gave this to my grandson for Christmas. The pegs pushed right through with a light touch of the finger and the red ends fell off the first day like they weren't glued on very well. I was really disappointed. Usually this brand is much better.
5,Ideal for a Busy Toddler,"My daughters each had a similar toy when they were babies, and when my granddaughter was a year old, we got one for her, too. Now her one-year old brother has his own, and it is one of his favorite toys. He loves to bang on the pegs (practicing his hand-eye coordination), it is durable and sturdy, the pieces are too big to swallow, it makes a banging sound which is satisfying to him without driving the rest of the family up the wall, and it helps him learn patience and persistence. I love the Melissa and Doug items for children!"
1,Throw it away - recalled in Canada,"My son enjoyed playing with this and yes, sucking on the pegs. But my daughter won't be because I read that this was recalled in Canada for toxic levels of chemicals. M&D didn't bother to recall it here because the American market is full of suckers who accept lax toy standards. I'll be replacing it with a toy that is NOT MADE IN CHINA and NOT MADE BY M&D."
3,a spacier MAN,"may be the earliest MAN recording from 1970 but my version i bought in the late 90's is terrible quality. no balance on sound. vocals and drums are not in the mix. guitar and keyboards are way up front,which i like but there is almost nothing else.this was a bootleg put out by the promoter originally and sounds like it.but the performance of the band is spacier on a couple of tracks that go nowhere.between terrible quality and the early experimentation of the band it rates lowest on my scale of all MAN recordings.the version being offered released in 2005 may have been remastered but i cant see it being much better. there was so little to work with in the beginning.for historical pespective only."
2,Not What I Expected,"Unfortunately, this item was not what I expected. I thought it was an audio of the TV show which celebrated the 100th Anniversary of Irving Berlin. What a disappointment. I should have sent it back to the seller for a refund."
5,Way cool Book!!!,"Do you like stories with death, loss, and torture? Well, The Devil's Arithmetic is the book for you.A girl named Hannah is going to the Seder meal, a Jewish holiday that remembers the Holocaust. She doesn't like remembering. Once Hannah opens the door to welcome the prophet Elijah, she is transported back to the time of World War II. Hannah ends up in a Jewish concentration camp. She learns that remembering is important.I really liked this book. One of the strengths of this book is the description and the word choice. The author writes words like, ""screamed or ""mumbled"" instead of ""said"". The one thing I don't like is that there is a lot of death, and people lose loved ones. If you are a person that doesn't like death or torture, this is not the book for you. It is a good book with an interesting twist at the end."
3,First impression:,Sounds like a scientific social studies mixed together to create one science fiction holocost thing- am i right??
1,Freedom of speech,STAR OF DAVID: 6 triangles that form an array of 6 triangles around a 6 sided figure. Star of David: the devil's arithmetic illustrated.
4,The Devil's Arithmetic,"I thought The Devil's Arithmetic was a very interesting book. It taught me some things about the Holocaust I never knew before. I liked how the author used such detail in the story. But I didn't like how the book got off to a slow start. I thought the beginning of the story was not very interesting. But as you read on, the story gets better. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the Holocaust or just wants to read a good book."
5,An excellent tearful book,"The Devil's Arithmetic by Jane Yolen is a great book full of excitement. It is about a girl named Hannah who is Jewish and is bothered by Passover and all the""dumb""stories. So one day,when she was going to her grandma's house for Passover,the door rang after dinner she changed into a girl named Chyna that lived in the 1940's. Hannah, now Chyna is getting sent to a concentration camp that she has only heard the unbeliable things that are going to happen next! This is a great book! This book is for anybody who loves to sit on the edge of there seat one minute, and the next minute be in tears. You should read The Devil's Arithmetic by Jane Yolen!"
3,good but too expencive for what it consist of,Basically it is not bad but for about $30 I expected more. Maybe if you buy those items separately in a shop it will be cheeper.
2,too flimsy,"After scoring pretty well on the math section in 11th grade, I wanted a book that won't teach me how to add but one that would sharpen my testing skills. Math Flash is too broken down so you don't earn the valuable test-taking experience. I suggest that you buy a big book with sample tests and just go through actual sections. My score dropped 50 points because I only used this book to prep for the math portion."
2,frustrating!,"The fact that the cover was almost as expensive as the pillow itself, is one thing. But the fact that it is so difficult to put the pillow in to the case is very very frustrating."
3,"Fox Searchlight Spotlight Series, Vol #2","This is the second of four three disc sets being released by Fox Studios under their Searchlight Spotlight Series. This three disc set includes The Full Monty, Bend It Like Beckham and Waitress. Vol #1 contains Napoleon Dynamite, Little Miss Sunshine and Juno. Vol #3 contains Boys Don't Cry, Antwone Fisher and The Last King Of Scotland. Vol #4 contains Garden State, Sideways and Thank You For Smoking. All four series are being released at about the same time. Would like to see amazon.com include this type of information rather than just enter a generic title that leaves you guessing as to what is in the collection."
1,Died at the WORST time,"I bought this for use taking panorama shots. I used it one day near home for testing and it seemed okay. A month later, and 1500 miles from home, I was shooting the Grand Canyon when it quit. It wasn't the switch, it was the molded connector that plugs into the camera. I am NOT a happy camper. I finished the shoot using the camera's timer, but that sure slows things down."
3,an uneasy partnership between the traditional and the modern,"Despite the preponderance of positive reviews, I am not convinced that all who appreciate the English tradition of church music will enjoy this recording. The vocal work is fine but the echo seems to have been accentuated for that ""mystical"" effect. The rhythm sounds programmed and to my ear cheapens the vocals. The tracks I enjoy the most are those without the driving beat and effects. If I had a choice between new age and old faith, I'd choose old faith."
5,Astounding!,"I was absolutely floored by this CD!I had heard good things about Angel Voices, and decided to see what I could find out on the web. When I came across an Angel Voices website online, it also suggested this CD. I ordered it from a little music store in the UK, not realizing I could've gotten it from Amazon -- and when it arrived, I couldn't stop playing it!One of the tracks, for some reason, reminds me of the theme song from NeverEnding Story movie (it's nothing like it musically, but it gives me the same sensation, that mystical sensation of a forever future), something I never hear, and when I do, chills go up my spine, and I'm floored. Any other music that is like it, I'd like to know!"
5,Great Overview of Salvation,"This book presents salvation from beginning to end, i.e. from faith until redemption. The author states his views of the text, opposing views and covers generally all major points of difference. He is clear and to the point. He does not preach or pontificate but merely presents the bible and the facts with many references of his research. This is a must read if you are struggling with any controveries about salavation."
1,Not Dishwasher or Sink-washed Safe!,"I LOVED THIS BRUSH SO MUCH I bought 12 of them in various colors and two different lengths to share with my kids and for myself, but after about 6-8 months of infrequent use, one by one the heads came loose from the handles and are now useless. This happened with sink-washed as well as dishwasher-washed brushes. VERY DISGUSTED!!! Don't buy!!! I strongly agree with this reviewer:Not exactly dishwasher safe, April 17, 2008By Lefty (KewGardens, NY United StatesThis brush far exceeded all the old bristle brushes, but following repeated washing in the dishwasher, the head came loose from the handle. Suggestion, get a brush that is riveted onto the handle. This one seemed to be held on with glue."
2,Lo-fi,"The sound is noisy and distorted. The picture breaks up and gets out of sync with the sound. The music itself is great, but I've actually seen better quality dubs of these same videos on you tube. Somebody out there has better quality tapes than were used for this production."
2,Very slow story and I couldn't even finish it. Boring to say the least!,"I keep thinking maybe I will go back and finish this book, but honestly there is nothing about it that I liked. It wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it is super boring and slow."
5,Presentation grips,I like the way the grips fit my hand.I shoot better with these grips.Good grips for the money.
3,"Beautiful music, poor sound quality","There is no doubt that Menuhin is a virtuoso. However, the recording quality of this work is very poor by today's standards. If you are specifically interested in Bach or Menuhin, I would recomend this recording; if clarity of sound interests you, one should look elsewhere."
4,Can't Wait to Read the Next Book,"Honestly, I didn't think I would like this book, but it was free when I purchased it on my Kindle so I figured I wasn't out anything. I loved the book. It is a frank interpretation of what many teens and preteens are experiencing today with a bit of humor thrown in. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."
5,Stunning,"A hysterical, peaceful work. Sandlin writes remarkably clean prose filled with characters that you'll remember long after you've moved on. Under the quiet Western sky, Skipped Parts still moves along at a brisk pace.While trendy candidates for Novelist of the Month follow a Masterplots plan of contrived situations and stupid victims of circumstance, Sandlin populates the town of GroVont with real people living out realistic, honest misadventures. An outstanding piece of writing."
1,This is insulting to Indians with its lame stereotyping.,"As a Native American Indian born and raised on the Reservation, I found this book insulting. It is filled with every wrong stupid stereotype that has ever been written about my Indian ancestors (who were Lakota). Not only is Ms. Edwards NOT ""the master of Indian folklore & history"" as her book proclaims, but Ms. Edwards obviously has NO IDEA of true Native American culture including Sacred traditions & celebrations. The so-called 'history' of this book is just as fictional as everything else. The plotline isn't plausable; not in the 1800's. Indians appear stupid judging by the lame dialogue she has written. The writing itself is infantile; more the work of a grade-schooler with very poor English skills. This is the worst book I have ever bought. I only paid a .25 and the book isn't worth that much."
4,WCW Backstage Assault is One of The Greatest Wrestling Games,"This game is a pure act of Phenomenon by EA Sports. Time and effort was put into this game. What went into it certainlly came out. It has over 50wrestlers, 10 backstage arenas, and no rules. If you are a fan of wrestling in the least bit you should get this game. Also buy the official Prima Strategy Guide."
1,This game doesn't even deserve to be sold.,"WCW. It stands for World Championship Wrestling, but maybe it should stand for either We Can't Wrestle, World's Crummiest Wrestling, Wheel Chair Wrestling, or We Can't Win. Either way, Backstage Assault reflects on all of these factors.In Electronic Arts' second WCW attempt, this game makes Mayhem look like a frickin' masterpiece. Let's just do a quick run-down: the graphics: horrible. the gameplay: you've seen better. believe me. the sound: why won't the announcers SHUT UP??I'm not gonna even bother rating this on my usual scales. I give it a 0. This is pure garbage. avoid it."
5,One of the best albums Sylvia Syms put out.,"Sylvia Syms had a long career stretching from the 1950's to the 1990's. During that time she made some exceptional recordings, as well as others that fail the test of time. This album, originally put out on LP in 1976, was one of the finest she ever made. (Another great effort, yet to appear on CD, was entitled ""Love Lady,"" and appeared on Rod McKeun's Stanyon Lable.)This production has that rare combination of good sound, excellent arrangements, and great taste in the selection of songs. On standards like ""Skylark,"" ""Mountain Greenery,"" ""My Shining Hour,"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" you get renditions that deserve to be called ""classic."" As a bonus there are several songs I haven't heard anywhere else. Among these are a super Coleman/Leigh song called, ""On Second Thought,"" which deserves to be a lot better known.For me a five-star album is one that will be appreciated and enjoyed decade after decade. This CD definitely fits into that category."
4,Still funny after all these years!,"I first read this book when it was newly released, and I thought it was hysterical. One really has to be a Beatles fan to fully appreciate the way Shipper took the facts and deliciously twisted them. Now, in the light of Dec. 1980, it has a certain poignant and bittersweet irony, but it is still a delightful read. The footnotes are my favorite part! Mark, I hope you find someone to rerelease the book...and I hope I find a copy!"
5,"Young Reviewer, I'm 17 years old.","This man is a musical genious. He has taken the art of mixing to a new level higher than anyone has before. I'm into hip hop and a lot of other stuff, so I'm quite open minded. But this album blew me away, I've never daydreamed like this before while listening to these tracks. If you want something to take you away to another place better than books or anything else, or even if you just want to chill with some dope music, then leave it to this man. he deserves more praise then he will ever get.......pick this one up!!!"
5,How can you pick?,"Out of Amon Tobin's first three albums, it is extremely tough to pick a best one. If I were pressed, I would name this a very close second to ""Supermodified"" and just barely ahead of ""Bricolage"". I'm talking two points separating the three albums. Having said that, ""Permutation"" is a different beast than his debut album. Released only a year after ""Bricolage"", this album continues in that one's veins, yet infused a darker jazz sensibility to create a dense headrush that leaves you breathless, and eager to start again. Some of Amon's best work is on this disc, and ""Sordid"" was featured in a Toyota commercial to great effect. This album is 70 minutes of non-stop brilliant sample cut-ups and melodies hidden underneath jerky drum-n-bass programming, a trip that takes you throughout endless permutations (sorry) of sound and space, and ends with ""Nova"", as close to a perfect chill song as any written. I cannot say enough good things about this album."
4,more studio brilliance from Amon Tobin,"Amon does it again with Permutation. I've listened to this CD about 5 times since I bought it 2 days ago and I really like it. Amon is amazing at combining sounds and beats that would normally never be found together and making them seem like they were never meant to be apart. Layer upon gooey layer of sax, organ, drums, strings, squirts, chirps, clicks, hiss and a never ending supply of samples make his music like audio lasagna. At times it seems like he resorts to some comfotable formulas but for the most part, his sound is ever-clever and fresh. His music would be the ultimate soundtrack for a David Lynch film. Anyone who can't decide between jazz, jungle or hip hop will love this blend of bizzare sounds. Not for the timid who want their beats spoon fed to them. So far, I've danced in my room, had sex, and taken a nap to this album, and because the mixture is so eclectic, all of those activities seem to fit."
5,Amazing....,"It seems so cheesy how every review on here is either five stars or one... based on whether a person was inspired or revolted (by the work). This album deserves all the praise that can be given it. Tobin's use of tones from the thirties and forties with sound clips culled from all over and brilliant sequenced rhythms stands in my mind as the culmination of fin-de-siecle 'electronica'. Visiting my folks, I happened to leave this album in the car and THEY didn't even turn it off.... though were slightly weirded out by the strange noises coming out of their speakers. Tobin makes the music of our grandparents relevant to both us and our children.... I cannot describe this album any more than I have.... Please buy it.... and everything else from Ninja Tune....Also, see Tobin's Cujo Album....."
5,My boyfriend & I both notice a difference.,Great product for our 40yr old bodies. We both have bad knees & I have back & neck issues & it makes a noticable difference.
3,NOT made in USA as advertised,Just got this kettle--boils water just fine. But not made in the USA as advertised here. Made in China.
5,Edward,Edward was great. Was hoping it would have been a poster size but having it an 8x10 was even better. It was a great gag gift for my brother.
4,Powerful stories of human spirit.,"Wow...what a great collection of the stories of the men and women who endured one of the greatest tragedies in our history. It took me a moment to get used to the flow of the book but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down! The book makes me proud to be an American serviceman and challenges me to meet and overcome the relatively minor obstacles I face daily."
2,Three good songs; Give him an editor!,"I haven't played this song in years; just amazing. Fire and anger makes you think he is going for it. I believe in happy endings perfect neil diamond. And the song for his grandson is wonderful.But the last song is so bad I can't believe no one said pull it. His saving grace has always been his melodies, even when his words are stupid and he oversings. His melodies fail him on this one.But three out of ten with so many great songs behind him; I will give him 20 more cd's before i give up on him."
4,UPED MY RATEING!,"After rating this CD 2 stars I watched NEIL DIAMOND""LIVE BY REQUEST""on A&E channel and found that the reason I made it so low was that Neil is starting to show and sound his age but this just makes him more mellow on this new cd(it probebly what we can expect in the future?)I found nothing upbeat like ""Sweet Caroline""America""ect.I guess this is not a bad thing, as a lot of his fan's(includeing myself) are getting older I recommened this CD to all his middle age audienceENJOY!"
1,"The most awful bit of ""music"" I've heard in ages","Is this album for real? Is Neil Diamond completely serious when he belts out the juvenile concept of singing ""L-O-V-E"" in a song? Are these songs about anything at all? Perhaps the worst of it is his ode to the movies, in which you wonder if this is a kids' album instead of a mature release for the general public. I feel that Diamond has both lost his voice and his touch (if he ever had one, or both). In fact, if I were a singer-songwriter--and especially if I were one as famous as Diamond--I would be absolutely ashamed and embarassed to put out this release. I would beg that anyone looking to purchase this disc first download some clips from the album and realize, while they are listening to them, that they are indeed hearing what they are hearing: bad, cartoon-like stick-figure music that, shamely enough, makes no apologies for itself."
3,Neil Back-But not quite a Diamond!,"It's great to have Neil Diamond back with a new CD however it still pales in comparison to the Jazz Singer as well as his early works. Classic Songs like Stones, Jonathon Livingston Seagull,and Play Me are hard to duplicate. There is one song that will stack up with his other great hits. Midnight Dream is a classic Neil Diamond cut much like Hello Again or Love on the Rocks.""You are the best part of me"" is very much like ""Lady Oh"" on the Beautiful Noice album. The song ""A mission of Love"" seems a big corny at first but then it does get your fingers snapping much like Forever in Blue Jeans. If you are a life long Diamond fan, add the CD to your collection.I like this CD much better than Tennesee Moon but it still falls a bit short of his other works. [....] After several more listens, the CD kinda starts to grow on you. I changed my mind just a tad..give it 3 1/2 stars."
4,Neil continues to plug away....,"I've been a Neil Diamond fan for years. Though I still prefer his classic work, I bought this album because it's the first one in 25 years in which all the songs are written and composed by Neil himself. I really felt bad for Neil that his 25 year marriage to his second wife ended not long ago. It's hard to imagine that a man that can write with such passion has trouble with love in real life. But don't we all? Some of these songs are a little ""strange"" but there are a few love songs worthy of praise. It's also amazing that Neil's voice hasn't faded given the fact that he's 60 years old. Neil did his best work when he was experiencing personal pain and growth, and that's what I think this album is all about."
4,Can't stop playing!,"I am a Brazilian Soccer Player and Fan I own all the Fifa's since FIFA 94. I believe this version is the best one of all but still with some bad mistakes as players skill(unreall)and just a few teams from South America.I don't understand how FIFA 2001 could have all the league teams from Austria,Belgium,Greece and Sweden. Sorry but who are they in Soccer's World??? What about the South American teams ?? Which club won the clubs World Cup in 2000?? Boca Juniors Anyway I play FIFA every single day with friends or against the PS(bad skills!)and I'm already waiting for the next release. If anyone want to change informations or cheats about FIFA please contact me and maybe some day we can play against each other and I can show a litlle bit more about the way Brazilians play this game."
2,Did Not Receive All Items,"The silver wear is OK, not the best. It's better than going to the Dollar Store. For anyone looking for a better set, look on. I also was short 8 pieces serving dessert wear. Amazon took great care in taking care of this matter. I only shop with them, because of the fantastic service. Thanks Amazon!!!!!"
2,Suitable set for camping,"I thought since this was a ""supposedly $100.00 set"", that I could replace the flatware that I use everyday in my home with this 8 place setting. I was wrong. It is about as sturdy as higher end plastic ware. One star is for the fact that I can use them when I go camping and replace the plastic ware that I normally use. And the second star is for the price I paid, which was only $18.00. It's true, you get what you pay for."
2,not as good as it sounded,"The pieces to this set are very thin. They don't feel good to hold, and the spoons bend easily. We are disappointed with them."
2,Low quality utensil set,The set cost me $9. I though I was getting a good deal until I received the package. The spoons are very light and flat. Not to be used for guests.
1,Two defective machines,"I went through two of these before giving up. It seemed to work well on fresh stains when it worked, but both units quit working in a short period of time."
3,They do the job,"I started out with a set like this but soon found I much preferred a set of fixed weight dumbbells instead. The weight-plate kind took a little time to change wights (not bad, but I do circuit training and don't like the delay)."
2,Quick-Start Spanish,"I was disappointed with this book. Because there are so many others in the field, I will not be adding this book to my suggested bibliography; however, it is weel-organized and correct."
4,I recommend this ....,"I have owned and used this equipment for about three years and it was well worth the money. It is sturdy, well built, and was easy to assemble. If you are looking for a standalone pull-up and leg lift machine you can't go wrong with the TC 3000."
5,Great pan,"The pan is great, so easy to clean. When you purchase it the instructions tell you to use the pan at 25 deg. less then the recipe tells you to. So far this has not been a problem."
1,A horrible game,"When I read some of the reviews for it I said to myself"" I got to play this"". So I went out and bought it. My first impression was that the graphics were descent, but there were WAY to many blocks and the gameplay was impossible. I though after awhile I would get used to it like I get used to most games, but I didn't. So take it from me (A guy who likes most of the games he plays and is rarely harsh on some of the less enjoyable ones) do not buy this game! At most try it at a friends house."
1,Worst product EVER!,"I chose this gift for my companies 10 year service award, I needed a new set of pans so thought it would be perfect! Received the cookware and used it for almost 3 months. I noticed that one of the pans had the teflon bubbling up on the pan. After washing it now there are patches of the non-stick coating gone! So, I thought I would just contact them, I filled out the registration card so it would be under warranty. First it took me 2 e-mails to even get a response from them. They they told me to ship it back to them, me paying the shipping of course and to enclose $7 for them to return the pan to me after they ""inspected"" it. They didn't say if they would send a new pan if I was getting the old pan, nothing. I'm sorry but me being the customer why am I to pay for their poor product to be returned to them and then pay to maybe have their poor product shipped back to me. No, I don't think so. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again!!"
5,"""THe One""","I am on a friends computor. I really enjoyed the book I am single and live in Southern Australia , I appreciate books that teach how best we can live for our Lord Jesus Christ...... Don BirchPS AS I said before please note this is a friends e-mail address"
3,"Awww, but the sequels are SOOOOOOO cute!!!!!!","You're one of Us Now, It Takes All Sorts, Peaceful Valley and If We Hold On Together are TERRIFIC! Buy this CD if you like cute children's music or Land Before Time or both!"
4,Great to Listen To,"Ian Carmichael is one of the best readers I've come across. If you've seen him as Lord Peter Wimsey on TV and been, shall we say, ambivalent about his portrayal, don't let that turn you away from the audiotapes. On tape, Mr. Carmichael catches the essence of Peter Wimsey: the quick, light speech; the self-aware mockery; sensitivity covered up by quotations and babbling.Unnatural Death has always been one of my favorite Sayers (and also has one of the most fabulous last lines in popular fiction). In Unnatural Death, you get a hefty dose of Ms Climpson, a pro-active Parker and vignettes of village life (something that Sayers does very well). The plot is a tad convoluted (there are some points I still puzzle over), but psychologically, the murders all make sense.One of her earlier novels, Unnatural Death does not delve as deeply into morality or characterization as some of Sayers' later works. But it is still a satisfying listen that is more than a mere puzzle."
3,As advertised.,This was purchased as a birthday gift for a very young man at the behest of his mother who I like allot. It went over quite well.
4,A great find,"Kill Zone was an unexpected find. Advertised as ""disturbingly great"", I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent photography, interesting story line, and the great shoot out in the old Fellsmere school house. Vitor Santos (a young man at the time the movie was shot), did an excellent job as cinematographer, writer, director and man behind the scenes. Chris Carberg (another young unknown actor)played the part of the Priest to scaringly perfection. Don't look for an oscar award for this, but if you like thoughtful action thrillers, and want to see scenes from the cities of Sebastian and Fellsmere Florida - this one is for you. Good job and thanks for the memories."
3,A Nice Read,"This books makes for a nice quick read. By far not the best romance I've ever read, but it was enjoyable. There were some problems with the plot - especially the ending. I can't see how the last chapter would ever go over in 19th century England."
2,Disappointed,I would not recommend this because it is confusing. You couldn't tell the difference between the characters and they were easy to mix up. I thought there would be something wrong with the dance. The ending wasn't what I expected.
3,Groin Grabbingly weak,"I bought this CD in hopes of hearing some more klean beats like the lead song. well i found only one other song on this cd that i liked and it was an R and B song. nothing on this cd grabbed my attention. The bottom line is this: If you really really really like bustas ""what it is"" then buy the cd. . . but dont expect nothing more from it though"
3,Good information for international readers but basically made for the USA,"I live in Greece. Too far from any Small Business training program. Fortunatelly there are books at Amazon that have helped me find the information and ""training"" needed. I am in the process of openning a pet boutique ""1001 ideas..."" set me on the right retail path. Although many of the marketing suggestion are only feasible in the USA the overall view was helpful. What would have made this book perfect for me? more detail information aim at specific business fields. But I am not complaining I got my money's worth. By the way, the readers review on the books offered at this site really guide our purchases. Excellent marketing tool!"

3,"Not really a soundtrack, but still entertaining.","If you're looking for a series soundtrack that encompasses Schifrin's excellent TV scoring, you haven't found it. What you *have* found is a selection of interesting music with a jazzy beat that encompasses the feel of the series, if not necessarily the series itself. This will disappoint some, but the music selection is peppy and high-quality if somewhat repetitive in places and will delight many listeners."
5,Interesting look at temple mount and locating Holy of Holies,Ritmeyers prepare a good study and start from the outside rather than the inside and show using maps and charts how the temple mount used to look compared with the appearance of the temple mount today. Facinating read ending up with locating the Holy of Holies.
2,Got old really fast,"This game has some good things going for it with the career mode and the trainer/cutman. Still, The repetiton of this game makes it hard to play for very long. You figure out what punch works every time and you continually use it all fight long. And why not? Does anyone use defense? No, you just want ot beat the crap out of your opponent every time.Good for a rent - not for purchase."
1,????,"This game is like EA sports is trying to take a back step from Knockout Kings 2000. I am a Boxer and i know how a Boxing fight should look, and coming from a Boxers point of view, this completly lacks realism. The graphics are much worse as is the gameplay compared to K.O kings 2000, they have added much better features and made it more interesting, but the graphics are horrible. The boxers foot work is too slow and their arms look like they are about to snap off, sorry EA sports, this one just doesn't cut it."
2,Good but not the same,"This is a good CD for collectors and fans of Chavela who want to pay tribute to this grand star of Mexican music. The musicians are excellent, and the with Ana Belen and Joaquin Sabina are accomplished. But this and other modern recordings don't reflect what Chavela's voice was, and sometimes it is painful to listen to some parts of the songs where she sounds so different from what she was. It is a pitty that her original voice is hard to find in digital versions."
2,EARLY 1950s RECORDINGS FROM A YOUNG PETULA,"These songs don't sound at all like the sexy, mature Petula from the mid-1960s onward. They are sweet songs from the 1950s, many of which are taken from poor quality 78 rpm discs since master tape sources are missing in several cases. For the die-hard Petula collector only or fans of innocent 50's pop."
1,Old woman's travel book,"I purchased this book before traveling to Europe alone. Although I didn't ""backpack"" across Europe - I am not old enough to find the suggestions in this book useful. If you are under 50 years old - don't bother."
4,Good Price & Fast Delivery,My dog has been on Glyco-Flex for many years as a result of leg surgery so when it becomes time to replenish I shop for the least expensive price. I have purchased the last half dozen bottles on Amazon as it is the best deal I have found and it is delivered within two or three days.My opinion is the Glyco-Flex definitely helps the old girl with the mobility in her rear legs.
2,Not the smell I expected!,"I had previously bought this product on a trip and loved it, so I found it on Amazon, ordered and this one was not what I expected....too sweet for me! I guess is hard to buy a fragance online!"
1,A poor excuse for a sissor sharpener,"My wife is a dog groomer and maintaining a sharp edge on her shears is expensive. I thought I could lessen the cost with one of these - not true. First of all, because of the product design, it is impossible to sharpen the entire length of the shear. Secondly, try as I might, it was impossible to get an edge that my wife considered sufficiently sharp to cut hair. The grind wheels are flimsy and even mild pressure distorts their shape - prohibiting a good edge. Don't waste your money."
1,Poor Quality :-(,"Nokia 6102 FLIMSY phone! I had this phone for 3 days, and in that time, the screen froze, the key pad froze and the flip part felt like it was going to break in half. AND, the volume is horribly low and if your ear isn't just in the right spot you wont hear anything at all! Horrible ring tone options and no GPRS connection at all so there was NO way to order more ring tones.I returned this phone before it even had a chance to run out of batteries."
1,How about innovation?,"I live in the mountains, and recently got suckered into cingular's renew your plan for two years and get a fresh new phone deal. The phone arrived and could not be activated from my home.with the limited time I spent with the phone last night, The features are complicated and anti-intuitive.seems like with all the progress over the last four years, the camera, speakerphone, etc, that the antenna does not work as well as my four year old Nokia Candy bar (can't remember the number) which looks like it has been dragged behind a truck for several miles at highway speed and then picked up by a dog and carried home.If you live in an area with spotty reception, forget about this phone and the cool upgrade offer.I expect to spend several hours on customer service trying to sort out this flashy new phone."
4,CLP is great stuff!,"Spray you AR or Garand, almost anything and let it soak for a few minutes, wipe it off and you are done! This stuff is pretty awesome but I do wish that it had a mist function and not only a stream, but it still gets the job done VERY well. Highly recommended!"
3,A Little Too Simplistic for Older Toddlers,"I bought this video to encourage my nearly 3-year-old to use the big potty. Unfortunately, it's so simplistic that she loses interest halfway through and changes the DVD. Perhaps it would have worked six months ago."
1,Inane video is no help at all,"In this twenty-minute video, the first TEN MINUTES are about HOW GREAT DIAPERS ARE! The little bear loves his diapers, has wonderful quality time with his parents while being diapered, and even sings a song about how great diapers are. For ten minutes! The next ten minutes see the little bear deciding to wear underwar, getting a potty seat, and sitting on the potty once. Then, he's magically potty trained and that's that. Yes, it does have catchy songs, but do you really want your child being treaterd to ten minutes on how fabulous diapers are? This video is a loser. Potty Power is much better in all respects."
1,Not impressed - A Big Disappointment,"This dvd barely worked and didn't do any good. This might be good if your potty training a boy. It is very boy oriented. They need to list it for boys and make a separate one for girls. How can a girl relate to a story about a boy potty training, they are not the same."
3,'Destroyer: Tribute To Twisted Sister' (Dwell Records) Various Artists,"Know I've said it before, but I rarely get THAT stoked about tribute CD's - simply too many out on a regular basis. However, the Twisted Sister tribute release isn't bad. Noticed that half these cuts were supplied by thrash bands that I've never remotely heard of. Tunes I liked best were ""Shoot 'Em Down"" (one of my Twisted Sister favorites) by Seven Witches, ""Don't Let Me Down"" by The Syn, the in-your-face ""S.M.F."" from Black Earth and New Eden's contribution of ""Under The Blade""."
4,very good,"I got what I was looking for in very good shape and on time as promised. It was my very first time at Amazon. Now, I would buy anything through it."
5,an amazing woman,"This lovely book shares the story of an amazing and inspiring woman. I bought this for one of best friend's daughters and I will be buying more copies for my nieces. The pictures are lovely and the story which is based on the adventures of Mary Kingsley, a Victorian woman who explores Africa alone except for native African guides, is a wonderful example to girls everywhere."
5,no trouble,"Bought for my son who is six, he loves Teen Titans and especially this movie. This movie has everything you love about Teen Titans."
2,Mainly for fans of Robin and Starfire,I love the Teen Titans TV series but I couldn't get into this movie. Robin is by far my least favorite Teen Titan - so I found this movie pretty annoying since he is the main focus (along with Starfire). Hopefully any future releases will be more balanced. I'm giving it a two because it was watchable yet I still wish that I hadn't seen it. Robin and Starfire fans rejoice this one's for you.
4,pretty good,"We enjoy watching Teen Titans episodes, so we thought that the movie was pretty good,too."
5,A Great animated movie.,"This is a great animated movie. ""Trouble in Tokyo"" does justice to the characters and TV series while adding depth to the character profiles in this incarnation of the Teen Titans story. Not necessarily for kids under 5 years old; the animation is quick paced and could be scary and confusing to kids not accustomed to Japanese style animation."
1,using as a table,it is not comfortable at all... for the time i am using one as a small table by door. would not recommend
2,Dead on Arrival,"I expected a lot more from this book as a true taphophile. Although it has some funny moments, it repeats itself and as an American I often don't get the British sense of humor."
4,"A great expansion, but not yet perfect!","The Version 2 of Phantasy Star Online is a great addition to an already great game, with the addition of Tons of new items, a Ultimate Mode (which is REALLY hard) a Battle mode (fight your friends online!) and a Challenge mode (limited time to kill the boss!), version 2 is sure to keep the gamers busy for quite a time... Although the expansion is good, some things have been left much the same, including the limited numbers of items you can have, the online quests and the monsters. Furthermore, the disc seems to have slightly longer loading times...still a great buy though and a must for PSO players!"
1,junk,The 60 leds never worked correctly. Now it doesn't work at all. I do not recommend this product.
4,THEY SHOULD PAY YOU TO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game as a present ,and being a huge bond fan thought okay finally a game that lets you play with all the gadgets, in the cars, nonstop. NOPE, for a PSone game it still looks like a genesis game and the control is about a bad as it gets in driving games. Here's how this game was designed, lets take Sega OUTRUN (early 90's) slap a 007 title on it add some guns and make lots-o-money. Don't buy this unless you like disappointmen, frustration, oh yeah and wasting money!!!!!!"
1,Euh...how can a Bond game ever be this BAD,"Appaling...I was very excited when I first saw this game and bought it.After I played it though I almost wept with dissapointment.-Graphics are choppy and mechanical-Controls are robotic and unbalievably annoying to use-Missions were pathetic-it was basically just the car getting in the way and making you(Bond)incredibally unmobile-Camera views were infuriating I better not even get started on them there's a 1,000 word limit so...After I played this game on 1 player I was disappointed and so I tried multiplayer which also made me wanna puke. I crawled back to the store of purchase and begged them to exchange it for me and finally ridded myself of this pathetic excuse for entertainment.Torch this one on site folks, No joke."
1,Buffoon,"How can any intellegent individual take anything that comes out of his mouth seriously? Nothing that he says is based on facts. He just makes up stuff, day after day."
3,Pay attention to size!,"Note that the ""large"" *just barely* fits a very slender womens size 8. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before I purchased this item, and was quite disappointed to find that the large wouldn't fit a size 9 foot. The person I ended up giving the slippers to, however, loves them. She reports they are very comfortable, warm and soft... I wish I could attest to that myself. So if you're looking to fit an 8 or 9 (I wouldn't go above that), I'd suggest purchasing the extra-large."
3,"Quilted Microfiber Velour Bootie Slipper, Petl Pink XL","My slippers fit perfectly, but the bow on the top of one slipper has to be sewn on. The seam on the top of the slipper that holds the bow on is not stitched. I have been wearing them, but will have to repair them before washing."
1,Doesn't Fit on Seat,"I recently purchased a Town and Country minivan with leather captain's seats in the middle row. I purchased this seat protector to keep the leather in good condition, free from dents and scratches. Unfortunately, the bottom portion of the protector is too wide to sit on the seat and I am unable to use it. I will be returning it today and hope to find a better fit in another product."
3,Not intended for use with other nearby passengers,"I have a 2006 Honda Pilot and tried to use this seat saver in the middle, which has 3 seats across at the widest point of the car. Unfortunately, the wonderful design of a wide curved base is too wide and thus slightly covers the other seat belts in the car.If this was the only problem it wouldn't be too bad, because with some adult or older child maneuvering the seat belts CAN be used, BUT when putting this seat saver in the middle seat it blocks the one seat from folding/sliding to gain access to the back row of seats.I would recommend this seat saver for the back of a standard sized vehicle where it would be used in the back without anyone trying to sit immediately next to it and not in a seat that you would need to access the back."
5,Safe for seats and babies.,These came recommended by my local police department. They are certified car seat installers by the state as well. Built nicely and match my leather too. Highly recommended.
4,"Had it a week, already saved my seats","I just got a new car, and one of the first things I bought were two of these seat protectors for under our 3-yr-old and 18-mo-old's car seats. Within the first week, the 3-yr-old had an accident in her car seat, and there was a puddle at the back of the seat saver. I didn't have these in my old car, I can't imagine just how much got into the seats before. The only drawback I have found is that they don't conform so well to the captain's chairs in our car's back seat, and it was a little difficult to reach the LATCH hooks behind it. I am definitely happy with them overall, and would buy again."
5,Great for those nice leather seats and crumb catcher too!,"We bought this before our first since we had leather seats in the car at the time. We wanted to protect the leather from getting permanant dent marks from the car seats. This thing catches everything!!! We even had a few barfing accidents when he was almost a year old when the car seat didnt catch the mess, the seat protector did which in turn saved us from cleaning formula and gung from in between the back seats! This is also great for those runaway cracker crumbs and cheerios! We now have a different car without leather seats but we still using it to keep the seats a little neater from spills! Great product!By the way, when we sold the car with the leather interior, you never would have known there was a baby car seat back there!"
1,Not recommended for safety issues,The police department who installed our car seat and approves the installation of car seats doesn't recommend this product to be used because of safety issues.They even said that if we wanted to use it they wouldn't install our car seat.We returned the product.:(
5,Great,This carseat saver is great. It protects the car interior wonderfully. I would recommend this to anybody who uses carseats.
1,Disappointing movie,"For years I have waited for this movie to be available in DVD form, as I no longer have a funcitonal tape player. I love the actress Sonia Braga, but I could not get past the first half hour of this convoluted movie, in spite of the rave reviews I had previously read. Perhaps it's just me? Whatever the explanation, I regret that I bothered to order this movie in DVD form."
3,"Not as good as dePaola's other ""My First"" books","My daughter (12 months) LOVED the ""My First Halloween"" book by this author so much that I had to order ""My First Thanksgiving"" AND ""My First Christmas"" right away. The Halloween and Christmas books are much more colorful and festive for little children. The Thanksgiving book was a nice quality with beautiful pictures... but I do feel that it was lacking in the attention grabbing quality that the other two possess. I am glad to have it in my collection, but unless you were interested in this series I would choose another book just for Thanksgiving."
1,Too Country - not written or sung by original inventor,I thought this was the original song but it is not what they were playing in my swing dance class. Most disappointed.
2,Poor musical-drama of interest to Errol Flynn & Anna Neagle fans only,"In my ongoing quest to see all the Errol Flynn movies that I can, I gave this a look. First, Errol Flynn is once again - awesome (although one has to wait 37 minutes into the film until his part kicks in proper). Second, the dream within a dream approach of this movie is poorly handled. If ever I've seen a film & wished I could save only half of it, then it is ""Lilacs In The Spring."" The first half deals with a young woman torn between two men; the second half concerns the tragic love story of that same woman's parents. It is the second half that really shines with its echoes of ""A Star Is Born."" Flynn's portrayal of a fading dancer turned Hollywood actor is so memorable and honest. The sadness in his eyes come from a soul that understands his character all too well & it is heartbreaking to behold at times. Unfortunately, too much meandering in the first half to give the film overall a positive rating."
5,the beauty and sadness of hoig's sand creek,"Stan hoig's story of the Sand Creek Massacre is well documented and the biblography shows a direct connection to Historians Dee Brown & Elliot West whose accounts are almost identical This is the tragedy of colorado's fear and bigotry rising up against Native Americans and resulting (as one of Chington's Officers said,""they killed the only peaceful Indians on the Plains""...l50 indians mostly women and children The double tragedy continues to this day where Colorado has no marker near the site and the local landowners tear down the county street signs that would take you there and land designated as a reservation in an 1861 ""Treaty"" now has 'no trespassing' signs and stories of history fans being run off by gunshot."
5,Well written,"A reader will get a very good background of events leading up to the Sand Creek Massacre, the people involved, the mind-set of the era, and the fallout from the massacre. It was an interesting read."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am more of The Little Mermaid fan, but watching Part one of Tinkerbell made me become a fan of the movie. I knew I expected Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure would be to be the same experience as part one. But guess what, I was amazed! Part 2 was WAY Better, I actually jumped at some time of excitement and other giddy feeling from the movie. One scene would be when she is creating something and it broked!!! That is all i can say you know what i am talking about when you see it!"
2,thinly veiled porn,The poses offered and slight crotch shots are not approporiate and my fustration with disney everything from ceos getting caught to employess caught doing pedophiolia is constantly reminded. It is disgusting and I choose the barbie movies now eventhough the graphics aren't as good.
1,Never received the item as promised,"This item was ordered and I was charged for it, but I never received the item. Needless to say, that I will not order from this seller again."
3,What A Disappointment,Lost alot of the magic of the first. The beginning & end were beautiful but the middle really lost its way. Lets hope the next ones better
5,"""Tinkerbell Treasure"" is my daughters current favorite","My daughter is 2.5 and this is her favorite movie. She can't sit through any other movie, but can watch tinkerbell over and over. I don't mind, I like them too! Grandma watched her a few days ago and I put my daughter to sleep right and turned off the movie at the climax of the movie.... I came down stairs to find my mother saying ""I had to see what happens!""The movies are fantastic and I am glad to find out there are 2 more on the way."
4,pretty decent!!,"Avenged Sevenfold did pretty good with this one, although i can not say it is my favorite album of theirs. That goes to ""City of Evil"", but it's a really great aslbum that has much louder vocals than the before mentioned album."
2,Eh it's alright.,"This CD is okay, just a bit too screamo for my tastes. Well if you want more guitar driven A7X then get Waking or City. This is okay but just a bit screamo."
3,For beginners,Wheels don't roll freely which can be a good thing for the littlest ones. Durable and cute too.
3,Pretty good brush,"It gets your cat's fur silky smooth and has a comfortable, ergonomic design. Good heft to it, feels nice in your hand. The wood is of decent quality, but the bristles, which are synthetic, seem to lack the spring and durability I'd expect in a $29,900 brush. Although this is a fine brush, I'd advise that anyone looking for a high quality cat brush consider purchasing the Safari Soft Bristle Brush for Cats instead. For $29,894.94 less, you get a brush that is almost just as good."
2,My review,I thought the book was okay. My daughter loves the song The Itsy Bitsy Spider. I saw the book online and I purchased for her. I read it to her and she was not as into it as I thought she would be. Perhaps we will try to read it again some day soon.
2,very frustrating,"I just couldn't enjoy this game. I would get filled with anger and have to turn it off. I don't know if all these people played this game for N64 but the only thing going for this game is the graphics. The AI isn't good, it just cheats. Their guys can run and catch through your guys. It is impossible to run, because it is nearly impossible to break tackles. Your man is never open because when you throw the ball the computer players get a sudden burst of speed and all of a sudden your guy is triple-teamed by the time the ball gets there. Penalties are usually in favor the computer. Madden 2002 is a much better game, but that isn't on N64. If I had to buy for 64, I would ethier get QB Club 2001 or Madden 2000."
5,Excellent resource,This is an excellent resource if you are geeky about making beer or looking for some great ways of formulating your beer. The math is broken down simply and is easy to follow.
2,tent zipper was broken when received,"When I put up the tent it went up really easy, but the zipper was broken and I had to spend the week with the zipper flap open."
1,Junk,Bought this for a rental house in the end of 2007.Stopped working about two months ago. I called Whirlpool and was told to have authorized service dealer for repair. The repairman said that the blower motor needed replaced and that parts and labor came to $360.That is more than the microwave cost in the first place!This is the second microwave that I had go bad in one year. Whirlpool sells junk. I would advise anyone to not waste their money and buy a different brand microwave. You will be sorry if you buy from Whirlpool.
5,BEAUTIFUL!,I loved it so much! Bear and Bo are the best and this album proves it! Needtobreathe are an awesome band and I am glad that God has given them this talent and I am glad they use it!
2,Disappointing -- It Ain't No Panthalassa,"I must agree with an earlier reviewer who's 1-star review is getting buried, although I think 1-star is a bit harsh. I also am a big fan of both Carlos Santana and Bill Laswell. Based on Laswell's terrific job with the difficult ""Electric Miles"" period in Panthalassa, and my affection for Santana's jazz-tinged side (especially Caravanserai), this looked foolproof. Unfortunately, much of this CD is larded with sluggish, overly lush string arrangements and pedestrian harp arpeggios (both by Alice Coltrane). The reconstruction of ""A Love Supreme"" is really good, but the quality drops off sharply from there. There are 2 other tracks that are pretty good, and the rest just doesn't justify the project."
3,appliance holder/outlet,When creating this appliance holder they should've kept in mind that hairstylists would need a place to hold their flat irons as well as barrel curling irons.
1,Sad journalisim,"It is truly sad that you allow your personal feelings to interfere with objectivity. Most people that have listened to Corey's music have been truly delighted. Even those who don't care for him personally. That is true objectivity. To put aside your feelings and look at it from a true artist perspective. Not everyone will like him. However his music and lyrics are good. I would not enjoy working for you if you base your business savy on feelings. If you didn't like someone, I would tend to say that you would probably fire them based on feelings and not performance. So sad"
5,Aveeno products never fail to impress me!,"I have been using Aveeno lotions and other products since being recommended to use it after a severe allergic reaction to Penicillin as a child. Now as an adult, I tend to get dry skin, especially after showering. I started using the Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion months ago and my skin has completely changed. It not only feels better, but it looks great! My skin has never been so moisturized. The feeling last until you wash up. No matter how long of a time that is. Now that I have my skin, head to toe, in great condition I have switched over to the normal Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion. I go back to the skin relief when I have areas that are a hot itch or an itch that needs soothing. I definitely recommend it!"
3,Commemorative History of Battles of Phillipi and Rich Mountain,"This is a short, informal narrative of the the American Civil War battles of Philippi and Rich Mountain, in western Virginia (now the state of West Virginia). The author sides with the secessionists but is fair enough to participants on both sides. She recounts more detail than is available in most narratives of the Battle of Philippi, but does not cover Rich Mountain as fully, discussing only the northern of the two battle lines. The style is relaxed and often humorous, and makes some acerbic criticisms of both General McClellan and General Lee (Lee was not present at either of these battles, but was in general command of the Confederate forces involved). This is not a scholarly history, but a commemorative account by a local resident; however, it makes up in detail, local color, and good humor what it lacks in academic subsantiation."
1,this is a scam !!!,"If you are not a dedicated follower of the music scene, you may be deceived like me, beware! This is NOT Renaissance but ""M.Dunford's Renaissance"". Not all retailers mention it, however. Note the apparently deliberately chosen album name plus the well known classical tracks, and you may be tempted that this is a nice compilation. It isn't. Annie isn't on board and most tracks are mediocre. The classical tracks, though their new arrangements are fine, cannot save the album. Cheap tricks for capitalizing on the wonderful legacy of Renaissance! Go buy one of the old albums instead of this one, you will not regret."
1,Buyer Beware,"If you read the name of this album and you're reminded of that beautiful song you remember from the 70s with the same name, THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. You want Scheherazade. This disc is a poor substitute for the real thing."
2,Deceptive Photo,"Much MUCH darker than pictured. The golds, browns, etc. are overwhelmed by the red and you might just as well buy a dark solid burgandy."
3,Where are ALL the Christmas items???,"I ordered the book and generally liked it, but was disappointed it does NOT include all the Christmas items HH made and that this is a small section of the book.. :0"
4,"Good Content, Lack in Form","The content, the informations are really interesting and well written, but the form, the print format lead the reading difficult.But Goodmaybe a two volume and colour images ..."
4,GREAT BOOK!!!,"This book was an unexpected great read! I am recommending this book for my book club - there's several examples about relationships and marriages that I can discuss from this book. I'm so glad that I read it - it was interesting to say the least. It was an easy read and hard to put down... The only problem I had was in the beginning, I felt I was left hanging and found myself wanting the first story to continue as well as the others -- nevertheless, it's still a GREAT BOOK!"
2,"Looks nice, but...","These chairs functioned beautifully for the first couple of months we owned them. Then, perhaps as a by-product of having wiggly children, a couple of them began to wobble more and more whenever they were sat on. None have broken yet, and after the application of some Gorilla Glue on the most wobbly chair, that one probably won't break. We will continue to apply Gorilla Glue to the others as they need it so as to protect our investment.If you have a household that is gentle on chairs, these chairs ought to suit your purpose just fine, but I highly recommend looking into different chairs if you have active sitters in your household."
1,Depressed and Slow,The clips from this album tell of a whole different story than the actual CD. Ez3kiel must have realized their album was so depressing and slow that they worked hours to find clips. Do not buy this item...you won't receive it for 2 months anyway.
5,Great Video for Beginners,I'm not in shape by any stretch of the imagination and this dvd is helping me to gain stamina and hopefully over time to lose weight. I will update this review in a year to tell you how it worked out.
3,Classic Nanci!,"While definately not what one would normally expect from Nanci Griffith, it definately stands out as a powerhouse amoung her other albums. Touted as her ""country"" album she shines superbly on ""I knew Love"". (also one of my personal faves.)"
3,love wore a halo,"Though it's got the synth-sound of all of Nanci's MCA recordings, ""Little Love Affairs"" isn't grating...it's adorable. I think the other reviewer here who suggested little Nanci in her bobby sox would never stop being childlike really nailed it, especially where this album is concerned.It's got classic Nanci tunes on it -- ""Outbound Plane"" and ""Gulf Coast Highway"" are both Hall of Famers -- as well as some less well-known, but equally terrific tracks like the twangy short story ""Love Wore a Halo"" or the young-love retrospective ""So Long Ago.""Overall, this cd's got a little-girl country music sound, simple and earnest and sometimes heartbreaking. She calls this her ""concept"" album -- tales of little love affairs, naturally -- and it really is, closing with a fabulous rocker duet on John Stewart's ""Sweet Dreams Will Come.""""I'm lookin' for some love, I guess that's why people buy dogs..."" or ""Little Love Affairs."""
5,You'll feel this one working!,"When I first bought this video I struggled to get through the whole 60 minute routine. However, I kept at it and now I have no problems at all keeping up with it. It's fast paced which keeps you moving and never bored and the 60 minutes goes by really fast. I havent even tried the 30 minute routine included on the DVD yet because I love the 60 minute routine so much. A definite recommendation. I guarantee, you'll feel this workout in every muscle in your body! You cant go wrong with Gilad!"
1,not Prokofiev,"I am surprised and depressed to see so many ecstatic reviews of this bizarre performance. Although the recorded sound is excellent and the orchestral performance largely quite fine, Maazel's tempi border on madness. Prokofiev does not use metronome markings, but Maazel pushes the slower, more contemplative movements into barroom marches, and drags some faster pieces into mush. Comparison with Ozawa and Rozhdestvensky, who knew and worked with SP, will quickly show how truly and sadly off the mark this recording is."
3,Good but there are better models out there.,"This machine will build up your forearms, but its movement is not very fluid. Weider makes a similar device that i like more. If you are serious about working out your whole arm look into a product made by Ivanko. It is 30 times more adjustable and will grow with you. I highly recommend the Ivanko ProductIVANKO Super Hand Gripper Hand Strength Forearm"
5,My second one,I use this just to keep my forearms in shape and it turns out to be an excellent trainer for arm wrestling.
3,"Good, but boring","The book is a good read for those interested in the graphic design industry; however, it makes a very exciting, creative subject matter (to me at least) seem extemely dull. The information is not always presented in the clearest, most concise way, but it is a good 'starter' book nonetheless."
1,Sticky Lint Roller,"This item is terrible. First time I used it, it worked great. But after being rinsed off the stickiness was gone and it was totally worthless."
1,Do not waste your money,"I have 2 dogs and was very excited to get this to pick up after them. I ran the roller across my sofa cushion, and all that happened was that the roller got dull. I rinsed it off and it appeared sticky, but it actually picks up nothing as far as animal hair goes. I would have given Zero stars, but the system wouldn't let me."
2,Sounds like a great idea .. but ...,"I go through lots of lint rollers thanks to my cat getting fur everywhere. When I saw these, I thought it looked like a great idea. What I didn't think about, was how many sheets of the classic link roller I go through at any given time. Swipe, Swipe, Swipe, and it's full of cat hair and time for a new sheet.With this reusable variety, when the ""sheet"" fills up with link/fur, you have to wash it off and let it air dry before you can continue to use it.This would work if all you are doing is one occasional swipe, but not for heavy duty users like pet owners."
2,a few really nice melodies...but BEWARE!,"Super trite lyrics and an overly girly delivery prevail throughout, rendering almost all the songs barely listenable. For example, one line the singer feels worthy of repeating 5+ times is, ""I have no idea what's going on lately. I just wish you would come over and explain things.""I can appreciate a couple of the songs like 5,6, and 3 but even there I'm forgiving the lyrics (and voice). ....So if you're a 15 year old girl and you enjoy ""Friends"" or ""The OC"", this could easily be your favorite album, but otherwise..."
2,So So,This is definitely Not Jimmy's best. This album sounds like it was rushed through production. A couple of good songs but...
2,blahh,"if you are going for the entire buffett collection then go fo it, but it should be the last one you buy."
4,Buffett with a different twist...,"Not your 'normal' Buffett album, but a great one nonetheless. A diversion CAN be good! Some great tunes here - from Homemade music to Prince of Tides, this album is a treat. While not my favorite Buffett cd, it still puts a smile on your face like no other artist can. A great addition to any JB collection."
3,Very Slow Moving,"I was looking forward to a kid-friendly version of Jesus' life. This movie is cute but the story-telling and action are exceptionally slow. My children love Jesus and know much of the New Testament already through homeschooling, church, AWANA, etc. but neither my 8 yr old daughter or my 4 yr old son could sit through this movie. It does break the story into ""chapters"" which might be useful as a teaching tool in a devotion or Sunday school, but as a comprehensive movie about Jesus it was not engaging. The animation is fine but very simple. The dialogue was not Scripture but was Biblically based. From time to time it added a background story to a scene (e.g. Mary's parents try to return the dowry to Joseph before they marry because Mary is already pregnant.) Also, the movie is not close-captioned or subtitled. I recommend that you borrow a copy from a friend or church to make sure your kids connect with this presentation before you buy it."
3,academic interest,the best part about looking at exhibition books from old nerdrum shows is the chance they afford one to see nerdrum's works in progress. in 1988 many of nerdrums works pictured in this book were in transition; he subsequently altered these works. check it out for yourself. it's a way to study his techniques and critique his aesthetic choices. howard fox's essay is nice as well.
4,pivotal in the new jack era,together with la&babyface &teddy riley this album was very important in that it ushered another young male artist from a popular group tapping into a wider market.and for a while it looked as if bobby might be the next coming of michael jackson.the songs also challenged the tired sounds of current r-n-b at the time with so-many artist in r-n-b going pop bobby and crew followed control with a straight ahead r-n-b record that not only helped enhance new jack swing but also put bobby on the map as a threat.
2,"ok, but not all that it was cracked up to be","the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new ""channel"" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one!"
5,Works Great !!,"Product is really lightweight and really works great. I've been used to hearing mostly hiss on baby monitors, these are how things are supposed to work, just what you need to hear no noise."
2,baby monitor,"This produce it just ok. The rechargeable battery only lasts about 2 hours, making it pointless. It claims to reach a far distance, but often faces interfearence within my little house."
2,So Called Baby Moniter,"I am not happy at all with this product. The parent Unit wont hold charge more than 6 hours off the docking station. and also looses connection to the base for no apparent reason. But the worst part of this monitor is that even when on the docking station or plugged directly into the wall it shuts its self off with no warning. It wont beep or flash red lights like if it was a low battery it simply just shuts off. I couldnt beleive it, the 10 dollar monitors I had before never did that they just had a lot of feed back, so I switched back to them. worst 75 bucks I ever spent."
4,Really great deal.....,"Ok...I finally decided I should write a review on this since the 400GB version is lacking in feedback. It is truly a great deal with flawless setup on Win XP...and supplied drivers for the rest. It is true, as it seems with the 300GB version, that the fan is always on and that it is ""noisy"" at least if everything is dead silent, which is my case. I dont plan having it on 24/7, but if I did, the noise isn't bothersome unless it is in your bedroom...then forget about sleeping with this thing on (think of the early day plasma fans...).The reason it gets only 4 stars is solely due to the noise, which could be an issue for some...but the upside is this thing runs super cool...and I have absolutely no problems with it (speedy as promised). I think getting 400GB in a sleak setup like this one...is a no brainer."
1,con,"it lasted a month, the harddrive lasted a little longer than the case... i can't get a refund cause i already open it... i guess you get what you pay for"
5,Short'n'Sweet - but not for the beginner..,"The book, although it says its for everyone, is not for a beginner and a newbie to programming. You will need to have programmed in C, C++, or Pascal to grasp the concepts of program logic and control, bitwise operations, memory allocation, etc, etc. That said, and noting that the '9' I am giving it is from someone who has programmed before, ""The Java Handbook"" is an excellent reference to the most important classes and the chapters follow each other logically, not jumping in at the deep end. The 'Hello World!' example of an applet was just so right to have in the beginning. Buy this book, but beware of skipping chapters to learn faster - it won't happen."
2,I was still confused after reading this book.,"The insider's view of the developement of Java is wonderful, but the book is not written for the novice. When I was done with it, I had to buy another book before I really understood what was going on"
2,I couldn't get past page 61,"I guess I'm in the minority here but I just couldn't get into this book. I enjoy a deep psychological thriller as much as the next person but although this author grabbed my attention, he failed to hold it. The writing was too one dimensional for me and I just couldn't feel connected to any of the characters or care what happened to them. The suitable plot line was there, deep dark secrets were there, grammer and the rest were there but somehow it did not add up all together to form a compelling story. But maybe it's Richard Laymon's fault since I just finished his book ""Blood Games"" and that story just couldn't be beat for creepy atmosphere and a tension building plot."
2,"Disappointed with ""The Hour Before Dark""","I look at all of these positive reviews and I wonder if I even read the same book.My main complaint is that the book took 3/4 of it's pages to get interesting, and by then, the rest of the story had become very predictable, almost to the point of seeming amateurish.Add to that a cast of characters that really don't seem worthy of any pity (or interest from the reader, for that matter) and I was left less than impressed.I found this book extremely slow to get started, not very interesting when it finally did and painfully easy to predict.I wanted to like this book, but it left me feeling like most of the positive reviews might have been written by the author himself."
1,"Not the Ray Fraser of ""Labyrinth"" or Flight of the Monarch""","Very disappointed that this was not another Ray Fraser mystery and suspense novel. Not at all what I expected! It's the same author name, but definitely not the same mystery and suspense author that I've grown to enjoy. I did notice that the Mr. Fraser I'm familiar with, had a recent release, ""I am the Father's Son."" I guess I need to be more careful. I didn't realize that that there can be more than one person using the same author name."
4,Let's parrr-tay!,"Party on!I haven't played ""House Party"" that much yet. It was a hassle trying to install this game. I had to send the game disc to Aspyr to get me a new version because it wouldn't install.Last night, I spent around 6 hours building a new house with House Party. In this game, you get 100+ new objects, larger variety of floors and walls, new characters and skins, and 3 new neighborhoods (8 in total (80 lots)). With how much I've played, I like it. A new staircase in HP is a teleporter that teleports you to the second or first floor. It's cool. Another cool thing about The Sims is that you can add your own mp3s to the game, so then your sims can ""rock [their] body"" to the ""music."""
3,skip it...,"In all respect to Fred Frith, this CD had amazingly low interest value for me. Bits and pieces, none of them particularly daring or challenging, none of them even really identifiable as Fred Frith pieces, and not congealing into anything I wanted to listen to. Sold the album a week after buying it and haven't looked back; in my mind's ear, I recall feeling like I was listening to mediocre guitar rock when playing this. I'd buy the ""French Frith Kaiser Thompson"" stuff before this, and we all should know how limited in interest THAT was... Great movie, tho, for the record -- Mettlier was an Atom Egoyan protege, and the film really has some stunning bits in it. Alas, the music itself was not, for me, at all interesting without the images. 3 stars just 'cos Fred is such a nice guy. Don't buy this."
1,defrauded,"The mask is deceitful and induces it to believe that they are 20 NESSUM DORMA's versions interpreted by the same number of tenors, but the reality is that only it is Pavarotti's version"
4,NEW OASIS CD?!?!?!,"I was just browsing the web when I noticed that Oasis came out with a new CD, ""Stop the Clocks""! I got really excited and searched for it to see how many tracks were on it. To my dissapointment, all the songs that are on this cd I already have in my Oasis collection. I have all their previous albums and 13 import singles, so not much is new to me. But this is a great CD if you are a casual Oasis fan, but if you are an Oasis collector you probably already have all these songs. The DVD bonus might be enough to pick this up for some hardcore fans. This CD has a nice selection of their greatest hits, however I would have liked to see ""Whatever"" make an appearance on it, since it wasn't added to ""The Masterplan"" CD. If you dont already own all their previus CD's i would say buy this now! If you already have all their previous CD's, but it if the DVD is that important to you. Me....i think i will pass."
2,"Misinformed, outdated and negative","Having lived and worked in the UAE for the past two years, I'd warn anybody planning a trip here against setting to much store by the information contained in this book. It appears that Ms Crocetti's experience of the UAE was a none-too-happy one, and I'm afraid she's let this colour her perceptions of the place. Given that the book was written fairly recently, much of the information is also strangely out-of-date -- I'd be interested to discover when she was actually here. A much better choice, in my opinion, would be The Dubai Explorer which is constantly updated and contains a comprehensive introduction to the laws, customs and constraints you'll need to know."
2,Hard to control,"This is my first PS2 game, and only for 2 hours I found that it is hard to control, and sold it to a second hand game store..."
4,A great flying game,This game is one of the best flying games in the world! It's always fun to play when I'm bored. About 15 missions with 3 pilots to battle your way to save Naboo from the Trade Federation. The great graphics and many bad guys are cool. This is like real life. The last level is the best where you and your team battle with at least 40 bad guys flying everywhere in space. If you like Star Wars or any type of flying game then this is for you!
4,Good Game,"Weell, overall, its a great game. Graphics and gameplay are exceptional, and its quite reallistic. The variaty of the different characters, their ships, their fighting strategies, attitudes, reflect on who they are. Nym- a ... space pirate-big guns, heavy missiles, bad attitude. Vana Sage- mercenary for hire- packing nano missiles, tagging blasters, superior handling,menuveribility, speed, and a biiig rack'o' lamb. Rhys- a cocky, young man who seekes revenge on a mercenary group for killing his childhood crush, grown into a manhood interest- proton torpedoes, lasers with the strength to destroy a Merc Dagger with 3 solid hits, Yup! This boys skills are pretty even. Thanks for reading. Hope this helps! P.S. The game is pretty short."
3,"Great Game,But It Could Be Better","Star Wars:Starfighter is a good game,but it could be better.One of it's greatest flaws is that the game is WAY,WAY too short.Yeah,yeah,it might be fourteen levels long,but most of the bonus goals want you to finish the level in four minutes.Four minutes!And I'm not saying that thats hard.On most levels I finish within three to four minutes!The longest levels are the last two levels, but they are only about ten minutes long each. That means only about an hour and a half of game time(and that's with all the cinimas!). Another flaw is the non-consistincy in difficulty.The first level is a proving ground that let's you get used to the controls and stuff,and then in the second level your protecting the Queen,which is no easy feat. Other then those two problems the game is great.It's graphics are great,and it is a great Star Wars simulator."
5,this game rocks!!!!!,so far this is one of my favorite ps2 games. everything about it is great. a little easy to beat but its one of those games wher eyou can play over and over agian. the graphics are incredible. the sound is even better. i recomend this game to everyone.
4,A fare game for dogfight fans.,It's a game of dogfighting and star wars. If you like either or both then this games for you.
2,Nothing Special,"After reading the reviews for this game, I was all psyched up for a killer title - how wrong I was!! The game is OK, but nothing like I was expecting. Yes, the gameplay is simple and smooth, graphics are good, sound is great. But where are the characteristics of a stunning game? I've been playing space shooters for a long time, starting with the original Wing Commander. The last Wing Commander I played (4 I think) had great movie footage, a wonderful storyline, multiple paths to take in the game, and a large number of missions, all of which were far more exciting than the ones found in Starfighter. And that game was released a number of years ago for the PC. To tell you the truth, I'd much rather sit down and play that than waste my time with Starfighter. When will there be some PS2 titles that are actually impressive??"
3,Colony Wars Meets TIE Fighter,"Starfighter is a rapid-fire, arcade-shooter style game; it has plenty of missions, each with a lot of replay value, but the game has little depth. While the gameplay is solid, it has nowhere near the obsessive qualities of SSX...In short, it deserves a purchase but will be kept near the middle of the stack."
1,REALLY SUCKS!!!,Do not believe the reviews about how great this game is! This game is one of the worst I've played. The missions are boring and repetitive and at sometimes close to impossible. There are only a few playable spacecraft and they ultimately suck! Don't waste your money on this game. It is very disapointing.
3,Mixed,"Dissapointing for a PS2 game but worth the buy if you haven't played Rouge Squandron and don't own N64. It starts off okay by giving you a training mission to complete that covers the basics but isn't impossible to beat so you have a good idea around how to navigate. The first real mission is a lot like alot of the Colony Wars II missions. The graphics are cool, lays a good arena for a air fight but doesnt hinder you with slow speed or gun overheating like CWII. I guess the only issue I have is it is alot of what I've seen before in PS1 and N64 games. Honestly I would say if you want a great Star Wars Game, Rouge Squandron for N64 is still it so dust it off. If you dont own it and never played RS, then this game comes close enough and I would reccomend a buy."
3,Passion,"What I like about this album is the passion with which FG sings this incredibly beautiful music. She has a great voice and is very talented, although her interpretation of the classics may be heavily disputed... She knows how to use her voice, but she doesn't do it the 'belcanto' way, so I know classical singers may feel incredibly uncomfortable listening to it. It is true that some notes sound screamish, but I do feel the music when she's singing it. It's commercial yet heartfelt, and that's a big credit this album deserves!"
5,OOH MY GOOODNESS MARTIN ROCKS,"The best buy I ever made in years Season 3 -4 of the Martin Comedy Series, I remember as a kid watching and loving this show on Friday nights. These seasons are full of humor like never before. Martin is a comic genius and thats a fact, enjoyed this series more than the Fresh Prince, Martin;s ability to play so many characters with such convictions blows me away, but when he plays Shenehneh and his mother I just laugh till I cry in pain. Thw whole cast is amaxing, Gina, Tommy, Cole and Pam, each of them make the show the #1 success it was. I can watch these DVD;s over and over again, thats the wonderful thing about comedy. Man the best buy I ever bought, Wazup, QWaz Up, WAAAz Uuuup!"
4,Where is this COMPLETE Flute?,"This is one of the great Magic Flute recordings, and while highlights are better than nothing, I do wish that the complete recording would be released on cd. Pilar Lorengar as Pamina, Hermann Prey as Papageno, and Stuart Burrows as Tamino are the highlights, although there isn't a weak link in the entire cast. Even the dialogue is well done here.Along the same lines is Solti's first Cosi fan Tutte recording, which is a fabulous ensemble performance. Lorengar is also on that recording (Fiordiligi) along with the lovely Teresa Berganza as Dorabella. Please, please, please, let us have these wonderful performances (complete) on cd!"
5,Still one of the best books I've ever read,"I read this book a few years ago. I've read it at least 12 times since then. I love Margaret Buffie's books, but this one is still one of the best. The lake area where she writes is a lot like where I live and so I really know the way it looks and feels. She has caught it perfectly."
4,Seeking to understand the calling of Apostle or Prophet?,"Dr. Hamon's book is a RHEMA heavily grounded in the LOGOS. If you desire to know how Jesus intended the Apostle and Prophet to relate and operate within the body, this book is a must. It is an easy read packed with wisdom and practical application of five fold ministry."
5,Awesome,My husband has had the same pillow for like 30 years so you can imagine what it looked like. He decided to buy another one because his no longer had any feathers in it. We received this pillow very quickly. I was amazed at that. The first night he tried it he loved it and there isn't any way I can get it away from him now. It is a great pillow and he recommends to everyone. We took his old pillow to the dump a couple of weeks ago.
1,The product was damaged,I go the product in a reasonably short period of time. When I opened it it smelled completely of mold. I don't know what warehouse they stored this in but I bet the rest of them are moldy too. I had to pay for return shipping. I was refunded the original purchase price but not taxes or shipping. I guess I'll go to Sports authority or Models where I can inspect what I buy.
2,The Bagpipes & Drums of Scotland / Folk music from Scotland.,"""Bagpipes and drums"". It reminds me of the circus songs, in someway. It goes on and on sounding very much the same. ""Folk music from Scotland"", has better variety and vocals. Some of the songs are lively, with the excited violin sound."
2,The Bagpipes & Drums of Scotland / Folk music from Scotland.,"""Bagpipes and drums"", It reminds me of marching in someway, it goes on and on sounding very much the same. ""Folk music from Scotland"", has better variety and vocals. Some of the songs are lively, with the excited violin sound."
5,Hilarious TV Show that is Entertaining Beginning to End,This TV show is one of the funniest TV shows I have watched in a long time. Each episode seemed to get better. Kristin Chenoweth is beyond funny in this show. She deserves an Emmy nomination without a doubt.
5,Phenomenal!,"I had never seen the show until one of my friends got my to buy the DVD, & I absolutely LOVE it! I cannot get enough. It's sad that ABC had to cancel it so soon. I would have started watching next season! :) If you haven't seen the show, buy this! You'll become addicted."
5,The BEST show out there,This is the best show that ABC has made for such a long time. Hilarious. I do hope they keep this one on the air!
1,Nasty,My lory hates this nectar. It makes a nasty pasty concoction with mixed as directed. If I feed it dry it sticks like glue to his feathers. It sticks like glue to the cage too and makes a horrible mess to clean if it drys. I have half a bag left and am searching for another brand I can afford. He love [...] brand but it is expensive & I have soooo many animals to feed with the best nutrition I can afford. I would not buy this again.
3,Title IS Available,"THIS item IS available for purchase from Oldies.com as well as Movies Unlimited.A few yrs. ago, Movies Unlimited released 40 episodes on VHS & assuming they were the Ist 40/104, the Episodes in Vol. 2 as with Vol. #1 were out of sequence as follows:Vol #1 has #34-35-36, then 25-26-27, then 37-38-39, then 12-13-14 then 20-21-22Vol #2 has #1-6, then 32-33, then 23-24, then 11, then 40, then 31, then 16 & 17.Hopefully, at some time in the future, they'll be re-released in chronological order to be followed by releases of all the other episodes.Diver Dan"
4,Good Educational toy,"This is a good educational toy, but my daughter is too impatient and does not want to listen to all of the instructions for the games. I would also suggest getting a box to put all cartridges and books in so that they can all stay together."
5,easy to take,My hair and nails are growing very well thank you. Easy to swallow and has no taste ehats so ever.
3,Jury Still Out,I have not used this product long enough to see any difference. So far my hair seems a bit better but that could be different choice of shampoo also.. Ask me again in 3 months/
2,Causes cystic acne!!!,"Ok, so first of all, this product did make my hair grow slightly faster. However, I started breaking out when using it. Biotin causes cystic acne, which is a very painful, under the skin type of acne. I've never suffered from these kind of breakouts in my life. I took these pills for about 2 months and finally realized why my skin had become so horrible. Not worth it! Google it, you'll see that it is a common problem."
3,Biotin,I have heard good things about this product. Since I have only been taking it a few days I can't say it works for thinning hair yet. But I can say it arrived on time as promised.I would like to do another review later to updated you.
2,Nothing special,"I've been using this for a few weeks now, and I really don't see a difference. Appearex was better."
4,seems ok,Who ever really knows the efficacy of supplements? Do they really contain the dosage and purity they say? Is the preparation done to not harm the phytochemicals necessary for it's absorption and viability?I take the product preventively but have not had any noticeable improvements from ANY biotin brand. That being said the cost per dosage on this brand is uncomparable.
3,Works... with consequences.,"My hair did grow, but I got awful acne on my face and back like some other reviews stated. I guess it just depends on your body..."
1,A lot of promises no results + acne!,"I have use the whole bottle as described, but did not notice a slightest change.I am not happy with this product."
4,Classic tales,Moe and Abjornsen are the Hans Christian Anderson/ Perrault of their culture. Any Norwegian will have grown up knowing and loving these tales. A real cultural classic and a great -- unusual -- baby shower present.
3,"Pleasant read, but not a lot of depth","A pleasant, humorous read, but not a lot of depth or emotion in the plot.The hero, Cameron Scott, is an actor filming a children's movie in New Orleans. The heroine, Jonni DeVries, own the house where the filming is taking place. The story goes like this: the hero and heroine meet, they fall in love, they get married. That is about the extent of the plot. There is no conflict keeping the two lovers apart, no drama, no emotional zingers or villains trying to sabotage their budding romance. I kept waiting for a crisis to loom over their sweet and steady courtship, but one never appeared."
1,This whole series [stinks]!!!!!!!!!,"Do Not Buy!!!!!! You see lots of ugly women, about 15 minutes of decent booty shaking, and a whole lot of stuff you'll fast forward through. If your buying any of these for girls, don't even bother. Get 2 live crews greatest hits on video. Stay the hell away from this piece of [junk] series."
4,Kenny Rankin - BET Live Performance,"I love Kenny Rankin's voice and the performance was excellent. My only negative was a personal one.... I prefer him with only the guitar and not with a full band and strings behind him. Also, it just wasn't long enough!!"
3,complete guide to bitds,the pictures are illustrated but the colors are not clear. there are too many birds picturedon one page and I found it difficult to find and ID the birds i saw.
4,good,"There are several nice patterns in this book, and pictures forevery project which is nice. Most of the yarns called for are expensive, and hard to find. I'm sure you could use similar yarns for a similar effect. The directions are good."
3,Wanted to like it,This was my first experience with Eminence skincare. I loved the whip texture of the product but the smell was a little strange - very earthy and woody. It wasn't a deal breaker but did take some getting used to. I really liked the product but after using it for about four days I could see where it was starting to dry out and irritate my skin. Now I do have very sensitive skin and a lot of skincare products dry out my skin. So based on that I would still recommend trying the eminence product line. It did seem like a quality moisturizer and they have an extensive product line to choose from.
4,Incredible Book on Finance that Reads Like Stream of Consciousness,"If you have worked in the financial industry or love stock market history you will probably eat this up. If your interest in finance is on the practical side then you can safely give this a pass. It reads like Warren Buffett (who is frequently mentioned) is talking to you. I couldn't put it down. It is very hard to describe because it is a series of conversations, choices, and confrontations to the reader. It does explain and show the concept of ""Super Money"" which is really leveraged money very well. That idea is not nearly as transformational now as it was in 1970 but here it is amply explained in a very compelling narrative. The more familiar you are with the behind the scenes world of finance the more you will appreciate the profound insights of the author. The wisdom of the message makes this book an absolute classic."
5,Easy to assemble,"I bought this for home purposes. I have four children who like to do craft activities. This makes construction paper easy for them to access. Also, it was very easy to assemble!"
2,Has not held up well,"This is the first year I have used this, and it has not help up well. I'm really needing something sturdier."
1,"The Eric Clapton Collection - maybe , maybe not, makes you wonder!","I recently bought this collection of 2 CD's from a storeUsed but like new for $5.99 , I thought I had a real deal tillI played both the CD's, not once but three times assuming thatwould like a lot of CD's sound better ""kinda grow on you"" so to speak , well they did't. They sound awfull. Eric Claption has always been one of my favorite Rock / Blues singers but I must have heard his better know songs. All the songs on both these CD's sound like they were recorded on a ""Boom Box"" you can hardly hear the vocals for the band. Makes you wonder what is going on with the people that put this CD collection out. They all sound very low quality. I do not recommend you buying this CD. Put your money into one of his better Cd's like the ""RainbowConcert"" I have never rated a CD on Amazon before, but felt thisone was so bad, that I needed to do something. Thanks"
5,Absolutely amazing,"I was around 130's on intake temperature due to my non-heat shielded exhaust manifold on my mazdaspeed3 on a hot day, even with minor heat soak. I put this on last weekend, and holy crap, dropped my temperature to under 105 all the time, if I'm moving, 90-95 degrees. It's night and day. The difference is huge. Grab this is you've got some intercooler pipes you want to keep cold in your engine bay and you won't be disappointed."
3,thermo tape,"insulation quality very good. Seems to be really durable, but doesn't stick very well. We had to wrap our pipe in it, and then put gorilla tape over it. Gorilla tape, on the other hand sticks great."
2,Millers Forge Pet scissors,Wouldnt buy again. Dosent meet expectation for quality cutting. Dull only after a few uses. You get what you pay for! Only good enought to use as backup scissors.
4,overlooked gem,bowie was a step ahead instead of following trends as he had done throughout the 80s. this album rocks with authority and the songwriting is among bowie's best since his classic period in the 70s. the band is tight and aggressive and yet bowie's melodic sense is in full display. this album deserved more attention than it got at the time. reeves gabriel's guitar work on this album alone is worth the price.
5,Common Sense!!,"This book is such a common sense approach to weight loss and maintenance!! It is an easy and enjoyable read. It is the best and healthiest weight loss program ever!! Thanks Jill, for sharing your knowledge with us :)"
5,Another Dodd Classic!,"Slipping into a Christina Dodd book for me is always like putting on a favorite pair of shoes--comfortable yet also exciting! She's so good at telling a story that I always feel like I'm in the hands of a master. I especially liked this story. Society believes that the heroine Caroline appears to have no positive qualities except for her ability to ""flirt"" but you quickly learn that she's intelligent and warm-hearted and someone you would like to have as a best friend. And Jude is a very deserving hero, playing at being a meterosexual while actually seeking revenge on the men who killed his brother. These two make a perfect pair in a perfect story!"
1,Disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointing and spent more time turning pages than reading. I disliked the effiminate persona of the hero and couldn't see what the herione saw in him. The prose lacked sexual tension and the story dragged along, pulling me through a contrived and ridiculous plot. I give her a star for finishing the book. This one is headed for the used book store."
4,A Good Read!,"While there's certainly no shortage of hype about the Internet, there is a scarcity of clear, effective information about how companies are executing successful Web strategies. If you're confused about how to carve a niche on the Internet, or if you're overwhelmed by the complexity of the dauntingly dubbed ""e-commerce initiative,"" An IBM Guide to Doing Business on the Internet offers a helpful starting point. With concrete examples and clear language, author Kendra R. Bonnett takes readers through a link-by-link plan for launching an effective Web site. She dutifully defines jargon and appropriately focuses on customer needs. As a result, this book won't appeal to hard-core geeks, but it does have plenty to offer readers whose Internet knowledge is at the novice or intermediate level. We at getAbstract.com recommend An IBM Guide to Doing Business on the Internet to executives who, when it comes to the Internet, just don't quite get it - but want to."
3,Give it a try,"This one is pretty good, but you have to have patience in the beginning. I thought it was slow and way too easy in the beginning, but then he picks it up and it gets harder. It's kind of like he eases you into it so you get used to it, then he lays it on you and make you work to get through it. I like this one on alternating days from weights."
1,boring,"If you are less than 80 years old and not bedridden - don't buy it. It beyond ""for beginners"", I don't not even know what category it is for. I almost fell asleep dong it."
4,consistent and challenging,"I've been using Gilad workouts for years. I also have been doing advanced step at the gym for years. The first time I did this tape, I was snoozing for the first two sections but the last two made up for it. The moves weren't complex but you can make them intense with bench height and hopping for high intensity. I'm in pretty good shape and this workout makes me sweat by the end and leaves me breathless. Sometimes I mix this by starting out with Gilad's 30 minutes fat burning aerobic workout then doing the last two sections of this tape for step. That combo works great for me!"
4,good workout,Very good workout. Takes you from beginning to end with a bonus abs section. Due to some health issues hadn't exercised in a while..turned 60 and found at first I couldn't get all the way through. But I'm getting there!
3,Not beginner level.,"I bought this dvd and Step and Tone by Gilad. Both are for intermediate/advanced level and I'm a beginner. I read the reviews and was under the impression that it may be more challenging than beginner level but this was too intense for me. I could barely get past the warm-up. The dvds actually say ""intermediate/advanced"" on the back cover. I wish I would have known before I ordered. If you're a beginner, be careful or hold off for a while."
1,Too out of date,"I did not like this tape at all. It was so antiquated and really did nothing to get you in shape. Maybe for 80 year olds, but not a 50 year old looking to get back in shape."
2,CD skips Not a good quality CD,the quality of the CD was bad. About middle ways into the CD it begins to freeze and skip. I thought it was my player but I put it into two other players and it done the same thing in the same spot. I could not finish the work out. So for me this was not a good buy.
4,Under the Rainbow Arch,Anyone who inspires to be a great poet would love this book as well as those who just enjoy poetry at its' best!Jo
4,History At Its Best,"A wonderful book to curl up with on a rainy afternoon or blustery evening. Through a combination of history and fiction, McCarver weaves the Jack the Ripper murders using his fictional detective, John Darnell, into a most satisfying tale. The suspense builds and the ending of the book was a true page-turner for me.I've enjoyed all of the John Darnell books, but this is my favorite. I look forward to the next one."
3,"So Valuable For Students, Professionals and Housekeepers.",This book is a special one and tell a lot of livestock products. It is a very interesting way of learn a lot from a genious writter. It is wonderfull to students of Veterinary Medicine and Meat Science couse this book make a real coverage of meat processing. I said to you: Read(and buy! ) this one!
4,only two dvds,"The Read and Share Bible DVDs are excellent. My two year old loves them. And so do we. I thought this was a 5-DVD boxed set; the description wasn't very clear. The two DVDs that come with this are great, but you can get them cheaper along with the Read and Share Bible book."
5,Great!!,"I have three boys and they love this dvd. Not only are they hearing to God's word, it is capturing their full attention and also being embedded in their hearts and minds. There is a lot of times when my oldest Son who is 6, come up to me and start asking questions about why the characters did what they did and it opens the door for me to talk to them about the bible. I love this as well, it is very refreshing for me as well to hear and listen to this."
1,the ghost of each room,Some reviewers call this album experimental. The only thing experimental about it is how much offensive noise one can produce using latest technology in sound recordings. I can't believe anyone can actually listen to these so called experimental sounds and not be offended by the lack of talent that is being displayed. I gave it a rating of one because there are some bright spots but they are very few and far in between.
4,G&S are the best,"This is a terrific collection of Gilbert and Sullivan works. There were more songs on the cd than I wanted, so I end up skipping around while I listen. Still, it is one of my favorite musical cds to listen to."
3,Good Only as a Supplement,"This book can't really stand on its own, but is a good supplement to Talk About Good I and II. The artwork is great the stories by Sonnier are delightfully nostalgic. I found the text, however, to be unorganized and the recipes seemed to be reminiscent of ones that could be found on the back of a Campbell's Soup can. As a transplanted Cajun living away from Louisiana, I always refer to T.A.G. I and II and use them religiously and only refer to Tell Me More if I want a variation on a recipe that I already know."
2,Doesn't write seamlessly,"I've recently begun using fountain pens and started with one of the pilot disposable pens and was quite happy, with the exception of the ink running a bit. I got this pen as a Christmas gift but have not been entirely satisfied. I now have the opposite problem I had with the pilot pen. If I attempt to strike a line, even at slower speeds, I usually do not end up with a continuous line. I thought perhaps it was just the ink cartridge, so I got a converter and filled it with Noodler's polar black (after flushing the pen with an ammonia/water mixture), but I'm still having the same issue with not being able to strike a seamless line. Perhaps this is just common of the fine nibs, but it's been rather frustrating."
4,Great choice for a first fountain pen,"Really enjoying my Lamy Safari Fountain Pen. Writes smooth and rich, and I've experienced no problems with the ink running. Great value for under $30."
4,A great pen but Fine looks like Medium I,I have the Parker Urban fountain pen and it costs about the same as this pen but is heavier (a plus to me) and has a medium nib. I got this pen for the fine nib and found them to both write the same but the Parker's script was darker than the Lamy even though they both were using the Parker ink. Overall it's a good pen but I need a heavy pen for my hand not to cramp when writing.
4,Great Fountain Pen,This is my first fountain pen and it is a great one. It is very light compared to other fountain pens that I have tried. The pen does not leak at all and it writes smoothly. It is a great first fountain pen! The only bad thing I have to say about it so far is that it comes with a blue ink cartridge and I would prefer black.
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I've been using this pen for a couple weeks now and while it's nicely styled and manufactured, the most important reason for purchasing (how it writes) is where it falls short. The pen often will not release ink when I start to write - often scratching at the paper with no ink flowing. This happens frequently - not sure I've been able to get through a full sentence without it happening at least once. Perhaps the nib I'm using is imperfect, but I would not purchase again."
3,"Beautiful Form, Poor Function","I really like the design of this pen, but it's actual writing performance and ink quality is poor. My expectations were high.It is a beautiful pen, but I will be returning it."
3,wrong color,"It's blue ink, not black as in the product description. I also am not sure its a fine tip...seems more medium to me."
3,just right,"I bought a pack of this fountain pen. At first, I loved it I couldnt put it away but it finished rather quickly to my annoyance. It is a good pen. My reason for the 3 star is because it doesnt last very long."
5,"An excellent writer, fantastic price.","This was among my first fountain pens, and it is an everyday writer for me. It isn't a 'pretty' pen that you're afraid to use, but it looks good! Mine bangs around in a backpack just fine.They're much lighter than they look, and can be used all day with very little hand fatigue. The ability to change out nibs on your own is really nice, and means you can have a massive array of nib sizes with only one body for much cheaper than you could buy separate pens for."
5,GREAT PEN,"For 20 some dollar fountain pen, this is well constructed, fits nice in the hand and fine nib is equivalen to 5mm lead, or the needle point pilot pens.It has lifetime warranty as well which is nice. I have to see how long the ink cartridge lasts, if it does not Lamy has a conversion kit that you can use to refill w/o buying disposable ones."
5,Lamy Safari Fountain Pen Review,"Very solid pen. I can't say that I have tried tons of fountain pens but I have been through a fair number. This is best pen you can buy for the money. In fact it writes just as well as most of the more expensive pens. If you looking to get into the game you have to start with this. You won't be disappointed.One thing, I feel like there is a ""break in"" period. The pen actually got smoother after using it for a while.My only beef with the pen, and I feel most fountain pens have this problem, is that if you write really fast like a signature then you get some skipping.I use the Lamy converter, works great, with Noodlers ink."
5,A True Sleeper!,"I wanted to reach through the screen and kill the idiot actor int his film after just 5 minutes! The acting was THAT good!This is a phenomenally entertaining, annoying but riveting film (In a bizarre sort of way)Take a chance and watch this sucker!"
2,Disappointing caper/horror hybrid,"This movie looks good - and the actors are terrific... But it's oddly lop-sided: the first two-thirds is a VERY broad comedy about dim-witted kidnappers, and a caper that goes totally wrong immediately... and the last third is an out-of-nowhere switch to torture-porn-type horror (pick-axes sinking into thighs, in close-up... feet cut off with shovels, etc.), perpetrated by a monster who hasn't been anywhere NEAR the movie until the last 30 minutes... In the first hour, the comedy of stupid guys doing stupid things gets very repetitive: and it almost feels like, to stretch the movie out to feature length, the film-makers just grafted on a generic gore-fest to finish things up.If you want to see a GREAT British horror-comedy, check out SHAUN OF THE DEAD, SEVERANCE... or the forerunner of them all, SHALLOW GRAVE. The Cottage isn't terrible, it's just a waste of many talented performers and a great cinematographer."
4,Funny Horror,"This film delivers laughs and scary sitsutions.... if you haven't seen this get it own it... its really very good don't know what film to compare it to... the actors are believable, the story line is like nothing I've seen before.... its really good."
1,Don't buy this unless you want your computer to crash!,"Corel was part of the bundled software on my new computer, and I have never been happy with it. The spreadsheet is not as useful as Excel, I spent the better part of an afternoon trying to get it to do a pie chart correctly. It never did. Linear regression formulas are next to impossible, too. The word processor freezes far too frequently, and for no reason whatsoever. Printing seems to be a catalyst for it's demise, but it still will randomly just shut down. The email program is a joke, I started it once and have never even bothered with it again, even Outlook Express is better. Corel office has only two redeeming qualities: 1) It will export to PDF format, and 2) NO OFFICE ASSISTANT!!Additionaly, if you need to send a file to someone who has Microsoft Word, just forget it, because although it will save in Word format, it will transpose things and garble it.I would recomend writing with pen and paper before using Corel WordPerfect."
2,mixed review,"I liked the fact that the interest of children was at the heart of the book. The author comes across as a strong advocate for young pupils. I also think he can be naive. Children are human and have human weaknesses such as laziness, dishonesty and irresponsibility just like adults. Social skills and self-control are learned skills every bit as important as academic skills. I think too much blame is placed on teachers here. He does have excellent suggestions to making parent-teacher conferences more productive."
2,Would loose me in some spots,"I'm the type of person where in order for me to read a book, you have to keep me interested. I read the book because I wanted to see how it would end, but I had to really struggle to complete the book. I liked how the main character wanted to change her life for the better. She fought to get to where she was, and would not let anyone take anything away from her. I just did not like how the book would get interesting, then IMHO get dull. The book was also predictable, I like to be kept guessing. It was an okay read, but I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library."
4,Easy to Understand,"I have enjoyed reading the information in this book. The insight on GI eating, importance of exercise, value of supplements is amazing. I have changed my diet choices to lower GI and you would not believe how long I am able to go in between meals. Why? because I'm not harassed by bouts of hypoglycemia. It's great. I haven't lost any weight as of yet but I imagine that's inevitable!"
4,Out of print and out of date,"Back when this book was published in the mid 50s it might have been a helpful insight to those entering high school. But today, it is just astoundingly funny. I am sure it is was not meant to be humorous, but times have changed. There is at least one big laugh on every page. If you can aquire this book, don't pass it up if you want a good laugh. If you want to find out what high school is like, read something else."
2,Not a very good scooter,"I am also amazed at how many positive reviews there are on this scooter. I'll start off with the construction. My daughter is 4 years old and of average height. There is only room for one of her feet to be on the scooter. It's basically a one footed scooter. They really needed to extend the body of the scooter back about 6 inches to accomodate 2 feet so a youngster can coast with both feet on it. The entire rear wheel assembly is cheaply made. The screws that hold on the wheels not only stick out and hurt my daughter but they have fallen off twice. If you tighten the bolts too much then the wheels don't turn without a lot of friction on the cheap plastic bushings.The pros, it's a DORA scooter with a cute backpack."
4,Good Value,I got this for my niece for Christmas and I was surprised that it was as inexpensive as it was. It seems to be well made and sturdy. I think it is a good product at a great price plus I got free shipping which made it even more of a deal.
2,Unreliable,I've owned 2 of these over the past 3 years. Battery does not hold a charge for very long. They are both in the trash now.
3,average,"the workout could be harder, I didnot sweat at all, but it is an ok dvd. I have been doing exercise with Gilad for years."
4,Super mario small 6 inch princess plush.,6 inch is not very big and I think they should not charge more than $10 for it.My daughter's are huge super mario fans and she will play everyday with this so it will be worth it.
2,just so-so,My Amazon purchases are usually great so I bought this for my grandson's Mario collection but I was disappointed in it's appearance. I was hoping it would be cuter than the picture shown but it wasn't; dress was even a little crooked. It was also not as big as the Mario and Luigi. Made in China of course. Shipping was faster than expected so kudos for that.
2,paint chips off,I loved this press at first but only lasted about two months before paint chipped....I was not happy. Poor quality
3,"Nice suit, but check the size!","We got this costume for our son at the local Halloween store, and it's very well constructed and looks good. It is, however, HUGE. Now, my son is a little small for his age (4 yrs), but this was way too long in the legs and arms. I'm sure Rubie's has checked this out, but I'm a teacher, and I have not seen very many six-year-olds this big, let alone younger kids. The review would have been at least four stars but for the sizing, so I'll end by recommending you check the size of this costume with your kid at a local store, and THEN definitely buy it from Amazon!"
2,Wild plot getting kinda tired.,A relatively enjoyable book. The numerous narrow escapes and quasi-scientific plot is a little thin. Most of the stuff is not beleivable. His first books were a bit better thought out. He needs a break and a strong effort on his next book.
1,never finished,"Maybe it's just me, but I have never finished a book from Jack Du Brul. I am a teacher of geology and was excited as to the prospect of a fiction book on topics of geology. I have tried three of Du Brul's books and never finished one. The whisky guzzling and sly humor(?) was too much. There is little character development in terms of getting an idea of what the person is all about, and the narrow escapes are just too much This coming from an avid Clive Cussler Fan!."
2,"Great sound, but...","I just bought this product. The sound is great. However, the connection part seems to be broken now and I get some noise when listening to the music. Bought for just half a month and thinking of returning it."
4,Cool Hearphones.,Sound great with good bass A bit uncomfortable to wear for alength of time. Stay pretty secure in the hear. Block outsidenoise.
2,Medium quality for high price product,"I bought an iPOD (8GB) and I thought to upgrade my listenning experience by buying extra high price earphone from a very good company (altec lancing are great in speakers).When I plugged them into the iPOD i was supprise by the sound image mediocracy.The original iPOD earphone are much better.So, I thought maybe impedance do not much the iPOD. So I test on my Denon Hi-Fi, Still iPOD earphone had much reacher sound.Most of the time I never regret buying in high price. This time, I don't know what to do with these earpohone.I can say that sound seemed to be accurate, but lack of Bass, treble is not smooth (I wouldn't pay $20 for these earphone).Joel"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,The acting was horrible. The conversations were painful. The story line was boring and nothing happened. Bad Bad Bad...This is a sad representation of indie films.You want a good movie? Go rent Bad Santa.
1,I Guess I Didn't Get It,"I read the reviews online here and checked the film out -- I didn't find it funny at all, let alone haha. Also, I see a lot of indy films, but this one was particularly poorly shot, I thought. But I guess that's why there's chocolate and vanilla."
2,It broke after 1 year of use,"I loved this watch. I used it a lot last summer while training for my first 5k. The run/walk timer was perfect for me.My husband used it at the gym a few times over the winter and now it's summer again and I am back into running outside. I stole it back from him and noticed it was dead. No biggie, replaced the battery and it worked just fine. Except a few hours later - it died again. Tried another battery and still nothing. Looks like it's garbage now as I am outside the 1 year warranty period by 3 months.I am VERY disappointed."
2,SLOW,"Animation, design, voice; all great. The story is slow and I could not stay in it. It appears to have been written for TV and commercials or something, because the fights lasted forever; and got boring. I do hope DC improves their straight to DVD writers."
4,Good Story.,"The movie was ok and mostly true to the book. It was'nt as good as Crisis on Two Earths but,to my surprise the original voices were back. Susan Eisenberg has the best Wonder Woman Voice ever,that alone is worth four stars. The movie I felt could of had a little more action and I feel DC is doing pretty good with the movies they've been releasing with the exception of Public Enemies,that was crap."
4,Japaniese Anima takeover,"I am a big fan of the older material of the Justice league, and I loved Teen Titans, and the entire batman made back in 2003-2005. This is now an area where DC is trying to let the full Anima of Japan take on American Anima/cartoons. For me, it was a well thought out story. I do love anima, yet with out the full anima effect, it made the hands and body and even faces of characters seem out of sorts. Unlike the artistic style of Justice League anima characters.I hope to see more DC movies and TV series to DVD for those of us who will be kids forever. However, either go full throttle with Japan Anima, or stick with America's version of art work used in the Justice Leagues DVD release. I like to collect My Superman and Batman memorabilia. Yet, for all its good intentions, the art work was a little off centered. I am sure DC will continue to create great stuff. I wish they would continue the series Legion of Hero's with cosmic boy and the entire group."
4,Excellent!,Tim Daly and Kevin Conroy back again as Superman and Batman (Conroy's is the only voice for Batman) made this excellent. I would have given it 5 stars if they had Clark Kent's father as true to the comic having passed on but otherwise it was great.Like the way they got Wonder Woman added along with the new origin of Supergirl.Blu-ray is the only way to go with a great picture and a digital copy for download.
2,Missing The Mark,"The pieces just did not fit. As the characters would speak, the camera shot only displayed their upper lip to the top of their head, in close up shots. That just didn't make any since. Batman was portrayed as indestructible. He was thrown around like a rag doll, and through a brick wall by Apocalypse, and should have died, but it didn't even leave a mark. At the end, Apocalypse beat the mess out of SuperMan and SuperGirl, and SuperMan was even knocked unconscious for about 10 minute, yet with one eye blacken and closed, he threaten an un blemished Apocalypse never to return, as he for forced throw a bub tub. I guess not, he didn't want another beating. Don't waste your money. You would be better off watching paint dry."
2,Superman/Batman APOCALYPSE,"Was ok, but I felt I wanted more, I was not satisfied. It lacked creativity and only worth watching if you have some time to kill. And superman is cabable of a lot more than what he was able to do in this movie."
1,Wow,"Completely disappointed. I was hoping this was maybe similar to Batman: Under the Red hood but I was wrong. Do not waste your time with this movie. Bad animation, they can't even get the lighting and shadowing right. Voice casting is so bad, these sound like regular monotone men. Such slow and boring dialogue. Turned it off after 5 minutes."
3,Cannot compare to the original comic.,"This would have been a very good story if I had not read the comic first. In my opinion, the movie could not compare to the comic. If I were to have seen the movie first and then comic, I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more. Having read the comic first, my expectations were very high because the comic was absolutely fantastic. Usually movies cannot fulfill the expectations of the books. There are scenes that have to be deleted out because of time constraints. The movie by itself is a very good movie."
1,Feminist propaganda at it's best,"This movie borders totally on the ridiculous Amazons taking on Doomsday's and wining. This movie is nothing more then feminist propaganda pushing wonder woman as they prepare for a new tv series. Save your money the animation is so,so and the story well the title says it all."
2,Rita Hayworth is not on this CD,"Question: Where is Rita Hayworth from the original sondtrack singing ""Verde Luna"" on this CD? Answer: She's not there, some other artist is singing ""Verde Luna"" which defeats the whole purpose of buying the ORIGINAL soundtrack."
5,Great Saw,"This saw was great right out of the box. A quality product at a fair price. I looked at a lot of saws, but this looked like the best for the money. It's solid and well built. You'll be cutting accurate miters within minutes of unpacking. Great job DeWalt!"
3,Not a Delta....,"I purchased this saw to replace a 10 year old Delta that was worn out. With all of the hype from dealers and other tradesmen I thought I would go for the DeWalt. It works well and can perform most tasks without difficulty on moulding, 2x4's and 2x6's but 4x's forget it. The guard sits too low to allow clearance and the motor labors on most pressure treated stock, even 2x4's. And, yes I know how to use the saw correctly. The thin cast table does not provide much stability. Perhaps I should have opted for the next or 2 steps up. This saw would probabally work well for a ""Harry Homeowner"".... You basically get what you pay for."
4,Unexpectedly entertaining and inspirational.,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I guess I expected just another ""fighter pilot"" novel but ended up getting so much more.....it is a fighter pilot novel, yes, but it offers so much more. I highly recommend it!"
1,"Disc skipped during songs, not very well made","wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes the original soundtracks, it is much different than cow boy bebop's sound tracks. The remixed songs were very tacky, the last song was a interview that didn't make much sense for me to hang around to listen to. 2/13 songs are decent to listen to, the others have been thrown around. Production value of this cd would be 0/5 stars if i could rate that."
4,worth owning,"fans of american popular music should own this. as a woman, king is often overlooked as one of rock 'n' roll's greatest contributors, yet she helped invent the genre as we know it. king considers herself a songwriter first, but this dvd shows that she is an extraordinary performer as well. few artists work this hard on stage or own the ability to create an instantaneous sense of warmth when working live; king is masterful at both. the concert was expertly filmed and the song cycle, although too greatest hit-sy for real fans, will satisfy the casusal enthusiast. enjoy."
3,More About Bin Raising Worms Than Gardening,"I have to agree with Deanna Dennis on this (see her 3-star review). There is a lot of interest in raising worms in bins, but for the real skinny on how they can help you in your gardening or farming I recommend:The Farmer's Earthworm Handbook: Managing Your Underground Money-Makers"
4,melodic mayhem,"This CD rips. There are melodic parts and plain out rocking/screaming ones as well. Again, another great band crossing that barrier between pop punk and hardcore. I love it. And be sure to check out these guys live as well because they tear the stage apart, literally."
3,el verdadero rostro del hombre urbano actual,"Esta divertida novela relata la búsqueda de un extraterrestre que ha desaparecido, tras adoptar la apariencia de la vocalista Marta Sánchez, en la jungla urbana barcelonesa. Pero el protagonista de la narración no es Gurb, sino otro alienígena que sale en pos de él y cuyo diario constituye el esqueleto de la narración. La verdadera naturaleza del relato es de carácter satírico: Mendoza convierte esta Barcelona, a un tiempo cotidiana y absurda, en el escenario de una carnavalada que revela el verdadero rostro del hombre urbano actual."
4,Good for the cost.,"Since other filters were at least 60 bucks or more, and I don't have a mint to spend on my camera gear, this was a good purchase, it does what it needs to, while it really darkens the view and makes it a little difficult to focus sometimes, especially in lowlight, it does great. Any filter you get is going to make it harder to focus though.Recommended for a good inexpensive filter."
2,Not as great as I hoped,"I really thought this was going to be great filter, but to be honest i really believe it doesnt have enough coatings, and when i try to use AF, it just can't zero in, on my 70-300mm nikkor len's, when i go full zoom, it really blurs the subject im trying to shoot, so i have to cut it back by half and manual focus, which sucks, because when i shoot HDR, i usually let AF zero in, and then switch it to manual, but not with this bad boy on. I'm sure there are better, I just tried to get a bargain, and that's the quality i paid for, my other opteka filters have been great though."
4,Good,"I actually haven't read the conversations-sections of this book, they seem so boring. But the little-paragraphs-of-observation-chapters, that make up the bulk of the book, are really nuggets of fun and insight. I've read some of them countless times. Warhol is one of the few ""serious"" artists of the 20th Century who had a great sense of humor. It comes across in this book. The title is meant ironically, so for those upset that it doesn't have more depth, are missing the entire point of the book, methinks. I have a Warhol painting and a signed Warhol print on the walls of my home, so I am a true Andy fan, and recommend this."
4,Does just what it is supposed to do,"Not much to review here. This is just an orange cord reel, good for drop cords or long strands of lights. It turns smoothly and works as expected. It might be a little sturdier; we'll have to see how it stands up to extended use."
4,good product and a good price.,"This item arrived exactly as described, very quickly. It works very well and does the job. There is a spot on the inside of the wheel you hold on to and then turn the handle to wind up the cord. The only problem is that it's sort of easy for the wheel to slip out of your hand as it's a bit awkward to hold, but for the price it's a good buy. Seems sturdy and holds 150' cord with no problem. I got two and am happy with them."
1,it's ok,"I bought it as a gift for my husband. This wasn't all I thought it would be. After a few months it got wobbly so we changed the size of the plastic cap that attaches to the actual shift stick but it did it again. In a moment of anger my husband hit the top of it, pushing it down on the shifter stick pretty hard, and now it's stuck. So I guess in a way it is now fine but dunno what we'll do when we want to change it."
1,wish i had not bought this,"unfortunately, kasey the kinderbot is a rip off. this particular cartridge is defective, but i don't think it's the seller's fault. since i bought the toy last year, i have no outlet for buying additional cartridges."
2,Book is ok,After reading the book it was not what I expected. I was looking for a more balance discussion of blacks in the media.
1,You can be a Stock Market Genius,"This book was copyright 1997! Old information, very confusing for 2008 (old references, which are in my opinion, now irrelevant). B. Hodgson"
4,I was embarassed,"My dad is sort of an intellectual type, and looking at my bookcase during a recent visit, he scoffed when he saw this title. Later, before he left, he asked me what I was reading. When I told him, he said, ""what about those get rich quick in the stock market books?"" I was embarrassed. Damn you, Joel Greenblatt!Seriously, though, this is a great read. I've read an extremely wide selection of investment books in the last year or so, and this is the ONLY one that touches on some pretty important concepts, likeStub Stocks to avoid LBOsLEAPS strategy to simulate stub stocks (basically, just buying calls...not that revolutionary)Merger securitiesspinoffsand the best discussion of LBO operations that I've ever read.I would strongly recommend you buy this book, if you consider yourself an intermediate-or-better investor. I haven't made any money from it yet, but I'm scanning for opportunities even as we speak, and I bet I will find some soon-- thanks entirely to this book.Cheers!"
3,OK,"Despite its cheesy name, the book describes quite well the basics behind Special Situation Investing. I wished the author could supply more numbers to validate his sayings."
3,Good Story,I liked it! it took me a while to like Charolette and Dare. she was selfish and he was standoffish. she just wanted him for the money she thought he had and he was a bit resentful of being forced to marry her. I did really like the book in the end and would recommend it to anyone.
1,horrendous heroine spoils book for me....,"What started as quite funny, QUICKLY got extremely annoying-I quit this book 50 pages in. The heroine is extremely vain, self centered, and will use anyone, even close friends, to get what she wants. In short, she's an absolute brat!I would never want to deal with such a horrid person in person or in a book, and certainly not in a romance. Completely unlikable character!no stars-save your money."
3,"Good templates, but thin book for the price","This book has clear instructions and decent templates, but relies too much on rather expensive metallic papers/plastics and bubble wrap that you can't recycle.Gift wrapping doesn't have to break the bank, or be more expensive than the gift itself.Borrow from your library first, before buying."
2,Weak Glue!,"I bought this product to protect carbon fiber parts exposed to heat, but the glue is too weak and not even be able to install it!"
1,Sub par.....,"The foil itself is pretty good quality, but the glue in it just dries up after exposed to high engine heat after a week or so. Bad design."
4,Writes well! Good everyday fountain pen.,"The writes very well. Good grip, nice texture, and I love the clip on the cap (very unique). Would like a little more weight to the pen though. Good for carrying in your pocket and not too flashy like many other fountain pens. The converter is a must have. Details say it comes with ""charcoal"" ink but the supplied ink is blue (not a deal breaker though as I use Noodler's Heart of Darkness or Bulletproof Black - much better inks). Ink flows very well and the broad nib is nice for everyday writing.This pen is a great value for someone who wants an everyday writer and doesn't want to spend a fortune."
5,Excellent music and service,"Smooth moves records music I totally enjoy. I was pleased to get this recording because I have ""Spring in New England"" and ""Seasons of New England"". This is music to unwind a person. In this very busy world, I find it sometimes difficult to ""come down"" from a regular work day. This music just smooths out the rough edges and I am a much happier person because I found this."
4,"I like this, I already know how to play, but this has a lot of songs and rhythms that I want to learn.","I liked it, because I have been wanting to learn how to play bluegrass. This book starts you out slow. You learn to play a song very simple, then later in the book some of the same songs get more difficult by adding on fidderent rhythms. I am just starting using this book, but I can see it is well laid out, and by looking through it, has a lot of the things in it that I have been wanting to learn. I started with a violin learing series, which is good for beginning how to hold and practice, but this book will help me learn the fiddle more toward bluegrass, where I want to belong."
4,"Was nice , was wrong one , they fixed immediately","This was a general lee car and outside box looks the same as authentics ,which is completely different car it self all together . If you don't know the difference between the cars ,you couldn't tell by the box,except authentics is marked on box with a sticker. This company solved the problem immediately and more then made up for there mistake."
2,plenty of power short term,This kit doesnt come with any extra batteries and when you use it constantly you will have to take a 1 hour break so that you can recharge your batterie and it has been very difficult to find extra batteries (which are about ...). I wish that I had never bought mine.
2,sheep part entertaining,"This was a surprising read for me. Just expected a sheep story, not a personal drama between 2 lesbians. That part was a bit too much information, but the stories about the farm and the sheep were entertaining. Just wish she would have kept the ""personal stuff"" personal...the farm stories were enough to make a good read."
5,A great resource and motivator!,"I agree with the reviewer above about the program information being outdated. However, the other advice and motivation is worth every penny! I could relate so much to this book, I could have laughed and cried at the same time! It's given me hope that trying to lose weight by going back to Weight Watchers is not hopeless! In the age of no-diet, and all the other programs that promise that you won't have to 'count anything' ever again, Weight Watchers is the only thing that will work for me! There is more to weight control than just counting points, it's also about creating new and healthier habits! Please do yourself a favor and pick up this book. You won't be sorry!"
2,"the guy has got chops, but where's the melodicism.","I've heard Jimmy's CD's before and the playing is good in terms of chops and time, but where's the melodicism, where is the feel? Having checked out his latest, midnight blue, i am somewhat dissapointed. I expected him to take his music in a new direction--his writing is somewhat different a little more modern--but he simply turns many of his tunes into chops displays, like his long directionless solo over hypertension. There is an abscense of melodicism in his playing that you hear in greats like Keith Jarrett, Miles, Wes!!...Metheny, Benson. Nevertheless the group that backs Jimmy is solid, particularly evident in Gerald Veasly's playing. There's a lot to be said for Jimmy's acomplishments as a guitarist : his tecnical skill over the fretboard is obviously pretty high. But chops and fast playing are no substitute for strong melodies that fit logicaly over the changes."
2,At first listen...,"At first listen, I though, WOW, this is gonna be good. But after a little while I saw a pattern of complete fret board nonsense. I thought the tunes like Stella By Starlight were cool, especially Mr. Veasleys intro, but found Mr. Bruno's direction less soloing annoying to listen to. Some of the tunes we're cool and the Tenor Sax had a nice tone but because the focus was on the guitar, I didn't find that part of it (Guitar) very musical. Seems to me he was more interested in seeing how fast he could play."
3,okay,This CD is good but not outstanding. I'm trying to dupe the one at the spa that was made by an individual and not for sale. I like this CD...just not a 5 star CD.
4,Fritz does Peggy with Benny,"Good album.Even for those of us who have almost all the Benny in the world, it is more and some different from the earlier BG with Peggy Lee.Sound is better and some songs different.For those who aren't forever Bennyfans and who are modern Jazz female singer pursuers , it gives a goal for all those new young -and a little older swing-jazz singers..Peggy Lee shows how to use a controlled voice at less than stadium volume.Nice album to have in an IPOD mix.Fritz"
4,Awsome!,"I got this game 3 days ago and it kicks ass! I have been playing a lot so I have already beat the first set of missions. The graphics are ok but the game play is awsome, being a tom clancy made game, everything is realistic. I would definately reccomend this game to any strategic gamer."
3,"Not bad, not great","I'm used to pure first person, so a squad based game was something new to me. Gameplay was pretty straightforward. I found it very realistic is some regards (movement, visibility) which might seem ""slow"" to many gamers.I found the AI a little annoying as my B team kept responding to enemies that either weren't there, or weren't shooting.The choice of weapons and opportunity to hand-pick a team is an interesting departure from other games.Not a waste of time, but not a must-have either."
4,Great price for a great item.,"I opened the box, turned it on, and it worked. I like the added feature of the protective cover doubling as a tray if needed."
5,It works,"My husband has a Stihl and this size fits and seems to work good, it seems to be of reasonable quality, he used it once so far and had no problems with it. I can't say what the durability would be but it appears good."
5,almost perfect,"I have had this cd a couple of weeks and really havn't had a chance to listen to it. Well....I decided to take it with me in the car when I was running errands today. I LOVE it. I found I was thinking of other things to do that were not on my list, so I could keep driving around listening to this wonderful cd. It was embarrassing though, I know people were watching me try to dance in my car, you can't listen to this and sit still. But this cd, well worth it."
1,"Bad as fiction, appalling as analysis - Avoid","This book would be unbelievable as fiction and it does not improve as political/economic analysis. Anyone who knows anything about economics and spends more than half a second thinking about the claims of this ludicrous book would see gaping flaws of continental size.As for giving insights into the political dynamics of Japanese policy making, it assumes on one hand blatant credulity and on the other fiendish multi-level plotting. Scarely credible. Bubble created by Bank of Japan, deflated by Bank of Japan, aided and sometimes hindered by the rest of the bureaucracy...Only for the credulous. Don't bother, buy something that is either better fiction or better analysis."
1,"If you like hard drive failures, you'll love Dell!","My daughter-in-law bought this computer and the hard drive crashed in a few days! Not taking a clue, I bought one and my hard drive crashed in 9 months. Dell techs came to the house and replaced the drives, but it shouldn't have happened to new machines!"
1,UFC 55: The Fall of UFC,"I've been a fan since 35. I can forgive the main event because Buentello truly was the number one contender. However, I can't forgive the dreadful card. 90% were C-tier fighters who wouldn't qualify as fillers, let alone killers. The fact that Dana White allowed an entire PPV to compose of these hopeless fighters is like swashing a bucket of urine at the face of God. A disgraceful DVD that promises to supply loyal UFC fans with more nightmares than Freddy Kruegar."
4,Great but yes it is outdated in some areas,I spoke with the publisher today and the new edition should be ready and in print in 3-4 months. A perfect gift for those of us who are graduating in May!
5,My soccer player loves this bag!,My 9 year old plays tournament soccer and wanted a backpack bag for her birthday. I ordered this one and she LOVED it! It has room for EVERYTHING you can imagine! I would definitely recommend this for anyone who spends a lot of time playing soccer and always has to everything handy.
3,"Great music, dreadful vocals","The band - especially Dan T.'s guitar playing, is awesome. The singer is HORRIBLE. It's a shame that such a great guitar player teamed up with such an awful singer. Honest - he's so bad, the CD is sometimes hard for me to listen to. If there was a good singer on this CD - or even one that could just stay in key - I would rate it a solid 5 stars. But with this singer: No way, No how. C'mon Dan T., you've gotta know how bad this sounds."
1,Red Moon Cashmere Sweater,You get what you pay for. I found this sweater to be very skimpy in size and not very good material-I'm returning it.
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!",I would not have made it through the first 6 months of my daughter's life without this swing! The option of going front to back or side to side prevented us from buying 2 swings as I know people who have had to! My daughter loved the moving animals and mirror! Wonderful swing!
4,"Good Swing, but it's a bit too Fast","PROS: Attractive swing with nice, calming music. The fishbowl mirror and moving animals keep our Son engaged and happy!CONS: TOO FAST!! Even the slowest setting is a bit fast for our 5-month old, and it's crazy fast for younger babies."
5,Love This Swing...,This swing was great for us because our daughter was a preemie and she ended staying in this particular swing for a long time. It was nice because you can change which way it swings and it has the soft washable cover over the chair.....I would recommend this swing to any new parent.
1,THIS SWING CAUGHT ON FIRE,"After about six months of use, the motor of this swing caught fire and melted. The only warning sign that we had was that the swing began to go need new batteries every other day. One day, WHILE THE BABY WAS IN THE SWING, we noticed the motor was smoking. I sent the swing back to Fisher Price but I have not seen a recall yet."
5,Best Investment Ever,My son is three months old and for the first 2 months of his life he had colic and refused to sleep in his crib. We have the clarion swing by graco but because it doesn't recline very far when we would put him in it he would fall over. I had seen this swing in the store and talked my husband into buying it and it was the best thing we ever did. My son will sleep the whole night in this swing he loves to be cradled and he loves to look at himself in the mirror dome at the top. If you have a child that is having a hard time sleeping or just doesn't ever seem to be comfortable this is the swing you should have.
2,Nature's touch swing is not for the baby,"I purchased the Nature's Touch swing and it seemed really great, but the swing design is poor. The functionality is really wonderful being able to switch from cradle to swing, and the music options are really nice, but the bugs that circle the top can only be seen by the parent not the child in the swing; frustrating for a child, they see something turning but it is not the cute face that we see, only the bottoms of the bugs. Also, the mirrored globe presents a very distorted image for the baby. They need to further improve their design. I called Mattel and the customer rep was very apathetic and unhelpful. We love fisher Price, so this was a disappointment for us."
5,Worth Every SINGLE Penny!!!!,"Oh, how I love my swing! Love love love love it!My husband and I splurged on this swing after reading all of the good reviews here and boy, is it seriously worth every penny! My son is 9 1/2 months and we still use the swing. At this point, I have it in his room and turn on just the music part to soothe him to sleep. Oddly enough, I even enjoy and am soothed by the music. :) It also works really well when he has a cold as he can sleep more upright than the crib. It is a battery hog, but we bought rechargeable batteries - if you do this from the start, then they are worth the money. We burned through 4D batteries about every 2 weeks or so when Jake was first born. It would be lovely if this swing could be plugged in....All in all, there is hardly a week that goes by when my husband and I comment how very worth the money this swing is! That and if we could figure out how to make an adult sized one, we would be rich!"
4,Papasan swing,"Nice swing. I thought it came with an a/c adapter, but it only runs on battery power. The product descriptions are very poor. Can't Amazon or Fisher-Price add one line to clarify the power options? (Includes a/c adapter, yes or no.)"
4,A life saver!,"We brought my son home from the hospital almost 2 weeks ago. The 1st night was a disaster. I tried to have him sleep in the cradle next to my bed...with NO luck. He didn't seem to like to be so flat when he slept. The next night we put together the swing and placed it by my side of the bed...BINGO!! He slept so well that night and the subsequent nights that I actually have to wake him up in the middle of the night to nurse. I am getting sleep I never thought I could get thanks to this swing. The motor is a bit noisy...as other reviews have stated, but it isn't anything that prevents me, my husband, or my baby from sleeping. It does take up quite a bit of space too, but again , I knew that before I purchased it and it is a small price to pay for the peace we have in the night. The price was right and the free shipping FANTASTIC! This was a great purchase!"
4,"Great swing, speed is a bit crappy","We love this swing. It's comfortable for baby, and because it swings both ways it is great at calming her.Only problem is that even on the lowest speed setting, this thing cranks! I would have like to have a very gentle rocking motion on low, but it really swings the heck out of her at any speed."
5,This is a fabulous swing!,"This swing has been an absolute lifesaver. It's great the way you can change the directions of the swing. Right now our daughter likes to swing side to side and it settles her down almost instantly. She isn't in to the mobile or music yet, but she's still little (three weeks), so that may change. Thanks goodness that the swings are so high tech now."
1,FIRE HAZARD,I have to say my daughter loved this swing and at first so did I. For 6 months my daughter used this swing and at times it was the only place she would sleep. So I thought it is a life saver. UNTIL- one night I smelt something BURNING - it smelt like burning rubber. I looked all over and finally realized it was coming from the MOTOR section on top of the swing because all of this smoke began coming out. I put the swing in the middle of the back yard. The SWING WAS NOT EVEN ON!! This could've happened while she was sleeping in it or when nobody was home. I was told there could be electrical problems. I called Fisher Price and reported this incident - all they wanted was to motor back and tried sending me check for less than what I paid for the swing. They told me they would let soemone know and maybe they would do something. PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL. I was lucky that nothing seriuos happened b/c I saw the fire in time but it could've been a lot worse!
2,Don't Belive the Hype (5 Star Reviews),"I bought this swing because of the reviews and can say that I am a little disappointed. However, before I start griping I will point out some of the few good features... my son does play with the tray table even when he is not in the swing. And... well I guess that's it.The negatives- The motor is noisy and makes a clicking sound.- Although it's barely used it sucks battery power like you wouldn't believe. This thing needs an adapter.- Having music and the turning toy thing work at the same time is hit or miss.- Expensive for what you get.For the last few months I have been using it as a toy holder since my son will not sit in it without crying. Maybe his bottom hurts due to lack of padding. Who knows... I would recommend the Fisher Price Glider, but if you have a boy it only comes and the yellow and pale green combo."
5,excellent,"Although it does need batteries a lot, this is the best swing ever. I'm so glad I purchased it for my daughter, now I'm about to have a son on Valentines Day '08 and he will definitely get use out of it."
5,Should have bought this months ago,"We bought this swing for our son when he was 2 months old. He has loved it ever since. It puts him to sleep when mommy has something to get done, he will look at himself in the mirror, he loves the music, and he watches his Baby Einstein videos while in it. It has served so many purposes. You will love it. Don't wait to get it though, you'll be sorry. It also easy to fold up and move from room to room and up and down steps."
3,"Lots of hype, okay swing","I heard rave reviews about this swing, and how it was a life saver for many parents. That wasn't really our case. Our son liked it okay, but not for any length of time. Also, when it was on the front to back swinging position, part of the base lifted off the ground. That made me a little nervous. Also, once he was able to lift his head and shoulders up, he completely lost interest in the swing. It's mostly for very young infants, because once they get older they want to sit up more and play and even when you use the second position it still doesn't sit up very far. The tray on the front with the little toys and rattles never interested my son at all. He'd play with them for a second and then wanted something else. He lost interest in this swing very quickly.On the other hand, it does have a quiet motor, and it looks very cozy for small infants. It's neutral colors look great in any decor. It's just a lot of money to spend on something that is used for such a short time."
3,Beautiful novel swing- didnt last too long for my baby,"She loved it for about 1 week and then it was over..It was very nicely made and loved the swinging motion of side to side(as did my daughter) the spinning animals were cute too, but she didnt seem too impressed with it after about a week."
1,Doesn't LAST,"My 1st baby loved this swing. We used the swing for 3 months then stored it away. 2nd baby came a year later, we used the swing for a week before it broke. Seriously for $140 I expected this to at least last for 2 kids worth."
4,great swing!,This swing is wonderful. Our daughter loved being in it from the time she came home from the hospital. She loved watching the little mobile above her. The batteries last a suprising long time considering the amount we used the swing. The only downside is the price of this swing. We only were able to use it until our daughter was about 5 months old because she was just too big to be in it anymore.
4,Great Product!,"Our baby loves this swing. She will sit in it for a long time and also nap in it during the day. She loves the mobile and the mirror on the underside of it,not to mention the numerous sounds/songs. Besides these things, I love the fact that it has a removable tray, iand ts neutral colors. Overall, it's just adorable and blends nicely in our living room. My only one huge gripe is that it does not have an AC adapter to plug into the wall. The extra cost would have been worth it. That said, my daughter is in the swing daily and we have not had to replace the batteries yet so luckily, it is quite efficient. Overall, I would highly recommend this product."
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks....,"Like other customers who rated this item low, my baby has been using this swing for only 6 weeks and it no longer works either!! The music started skipping like a broken record last week, and now the swing no longer swings and the motor just makes a loud clicking sound. I think the problems started when the blanket I had covering her in the swing was dragging the floor and slowing down the swing. That happened several times (I didn't think it would break the swing) and shortly after is when the music started skipping and now the swing won't even work at all. So if you use a blanket, don't let it drag! Anyway, when this swing WAS working, my baby loved it! She would fall asleep a lot in it. Fisher Price is sending me a new motor that should be here in 7-10 days. I hope this new motor works but it sounds like from other customer reviews, the new motor didn't work either after a while."
2,Great to LOOK at...BUT that's about it!,"Once I decided to registered at Babies R US for my Baby Shower, I knew I had to have this swing! It wasn't ""cheesy"" looking like others that I found, it looked really cute and comfy for my baby :) After my shower, I was thrilled that I did indeed receive this as a gift. I took it out of the box and put it together myself, which the assembly was extremely easy!! Now closer to my due date (12 days to go) I bought the batteries and put them in to show how it works. Well..... it doesn't work!!! Not exactly at least! The mobile and the music work just fine, but the swing does NOT swing!!! How FRUSTRATING!!! Unfortunately I threw out the box after I put it together, so now I'm stuck with a pretty expense swing, that's pretty to look at but doesn't swing! Maybe its just my bad luck....but I thought for sure it was going to be as good as I had expected, what a let down!!!"
3,NOT DURABLE,"@ 1st, we were extremily happy with the swing and our baby loves it. Side to side was great when he was a newborn, and now the front to back is what he likes. It is quiet, but eats d batteries quickly.HOWEVER: after only five months the motor has burned out. Fisher price will do nothing since we do not have the original box. For as much as this item is, and since you are supposed to be able to use it up to 24 pounds (1 year), you think it would last longer than five months. I think it is obscene that this swing basically cost us a dollar a day, not including the dollar a day battery cost."
5,Could not live without it!,"I decided to register for this swing because it looked comfortable and was really cute! I cannot explain how wonderful this swing is! It is a lifesaver! A girlfriend of mine says her baby calms down the minute she puts her baby in our swing, but hates his own at home. I have 2 other friends that also own this swing and they rave about it just as much as me! If you can only purchase one item for your baby, this is it!The 2 way swinging option mixes it up for your baby and the mirror and 5 different sounds on the mobile keep them busy for quite a while! I also love how wide and comfortable the seat is.. my son sleeps longer in this than in his pack n play!"
5,Baby Papasan cradley swing - worth every penny!,"My husband and I have a 3 month old baby boy and this swing works wonders. I read the reviews before purchasing and everyone was right - the baby loves it, falls right asleep or watches himself in the mirror. The featurs are great. He always wanted to be in our arms, this was the only thing he would stay in without crying."
3,Good swing... Burns Batteries!,"This Swing has the potential to be GREAT but it burns through batteries ridiculously fast. I've had it 3 weeks and have changed the batteries 3 times! First the mobile won't work, then the music starts to sound like a wes craven movie... then the swing arm action will stop (even though it's making it's clicking noise like it's working). If you buy this swing, know that you'll need tons of batteries or else buy 2 sets of rechargeable ones."
4,A LIFESAVER!,"This swing overall is the best. My son would swing in it for short periods of time during the first month but after that, he would swing and sleep for hours at a time. Until recently, he would only nap in the swing. We transported it to our in-laws lake house for an extended visit and it broke down and travelled great, much to my surprise. He is now 4 1/2 months and still loves the swing, however, we do not have him in it as much anymore as he is much more active now.My only complaint is that the base does appear to lift up, so much so that we have anchored them down with weights. Something should definately be done to address this. Also, the birds facing outward is too bad as well. If Fisher Price would address these flaws, the swing would be perfect."
5,You have to have this,"At 11 weeks old this is by far the most used item we bought(besides the boppy for breastfeeding). Now that she is developing more she stares at herself in the mirror while she swings and loves to watch the bugs go round and round. The batteries haven't even pooped out yet! This is great to put her in when she is calm and tired or alert, but you can't put her in here crying because it isn't a cure all."
2,"YES, IT SOOTHES THE BABY, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW...","that this swing, if you don't use the optional bar that goes across the midsection (see picture) your baby can lean off to the side and swing sideways while the swing is still going. Very scary.My son is only 5 months old and even when he was younger, we would put him in this swing to calm him down. It IS great for that, but you can not leave your child unattended in this. A couple of times, my son has leaned over, and the only thing that kept him from falling out was the harness. It only takes for your child to lean to the side a little bit and he can be swinging with his head parallel to the floor without the swing stopping. They say this product is up to 24 months? I dont think so! I think I have about another month left in it!Buy with caution. I don't have a lot of trust in this product in regards to the safety features."
1,be careful,"We received this swing from my nephew after he outgrew it (originally purchased in 2005). Yesterday we noticed a burning smell coming from it. After disassembly, my husband discovered that there was burning at the switch in the off position. After reading some reviews, we found that others experienced the same issue. I am so glad that my son was not in this swing when this happened. I called Fisher Price this morning regarding this and was offered a replacement of the entire motor housing (only parts that would be old would be the seat itself and the frame for the swing to stand on. I just hope that the replacement doesn't have the same issue!"
3,Noisy & Fast,"This swing clicks and makes noises (not a good thing with a baby you're trying desperately to calm down or fall asleep!) when it swings, and it is much too fast. The directions tell you to add a blanket to the swing to slow it down - I'd rather just have a setting that does that."
3,Disappointed,"The ""Waters of March"" is wonderful but the album is drab after the first cut. L Johnson"
4,Christmas Nitty Gritty Style!,"This is a very good album, Colorado Christmas is one of my all time favorite songs. They put their own unique style on traditional Christmas songs. I wish they had more of their own material on the album but it is well worth having."
5,great read and informative as well,"I really enjoyed this book. It shows the experience of a ""backyard sugarin'"" guy in great detail while being very entertaining at the same time."
5,Great New Talent,Great album from a strong new talent. Shannon has strong voice with plenty of feeling. She is a talented new comer who is making an name for herself as a guitar player and singer. The entire album is a great listen.
4,An Enjoyable listen for those willing to take a chance,"I was a little leary when I bought this CD, but Ms. Curfman is a more than capable singer, and I am envious of her guitar, and writing skills. There are a couple of misses on the album, but songs like ""Never Enough"", ""Playing with Fire"", and ""If you change your Mind"" make up for those misses. I was first introduced to her music when she appeared on the Jay Leno Tonight show, and she put most bands to shame with her powerful song ""Playing with Fire"" it was enough to hook me on this mix of contemporary blues, with some rock, and country influences. I will be anxious to see how she develops from here on."
3,Pretty decent remake and followup,"Based on the original Altered Beast the game did not disappoint.Its good to see Sega at least try to use some of theirold gems back to life.The game follows the same path as the original but addsin more effects, monsters and sound to providea good experience.The graphics were ok, but the whole thing was pretty cool."
1,ZZZzzzzz....,"Terminally dull, subtitled, black and white foreign flick that just goes on and on without even the satisfaction of a dull conclusion."
3,Its a codex,It arrived on time and was what I expected it to be. The only thing that was wrong is that one of the pages are falling out but what evs is better then paying $40 for a new one
4,basic,Basically a good book. Pictures are nice and I couldn't find many faults. Book could be more extensive.
5,Krautrock Masterpiece,"I have loved this album unconditionally since eharing it first in abt. 1980. sweetly textured instrumentals create a relflective, even melancholy mood, kind of like walking alone along some North Sea beach in October might create. Rother's playing is soulful, the sound is almost preternaturally crystal clear (as anything recorded at Conny Plank's studio was -- check the first Devo album or Clannad's Crann Ull) and the mood is unbroken through all six tracks. Want another reference point? Call Rother at this stage in his career the Krautrock Duane Eddy."
2,Avoid this one,"The last Marshall Crenshaw album of the '90s is as nondescript as its title. What happened? After a rock-solid Razor & Tie debut with ""Miracle of Science"" that was as encouraging as could be, Crenshaw produces this mediocre effort. It's as if he decided he was tired of being tuneful. Some noodling, some instrumentals that don't really go anywhere, and few memorable tunes to hang onto. I suppose he was trying something new, which is commendable, but think it through first and come up with strong songs and I'll follow you anywhere, buddy. Not this, though; this went to my local used CD store."
3,"Almost as good as the last Cd, but so damned short!!","While not quite up to the really polished gem of Miracle of Science, this new CD eliminates the covers (a MOS strong point) and substitutes instrumentals and some inane filler (the intro). Most of the songs are up to his normal standards, especially the gorgeous ""T.M.D."" and ""Dime A Dozen Guy"". The collaborations with Richard Julian and Bill Lloyd are surprisingly weak (the latter is the worst song on the disc). And guess what--2 out of 3 of the instrumentals are excellent (""You Said What?"" is a standout). Crenshaw is still the power-pop king, and this CD does nothing to tarnish that rep. Minus one star for a running time of just over a half-hour; going retro does not mean ignoring that CD's run 60-75 minutes!"
3,Micro Go-Round,"This product seems to work as advertised, but needs to be re-wound more than indicated. I would still recommend it if your microwave doesn't have a built-in turntable"
2,It's OK,"Product is OK, works fine. However, found that despite claims, it takes longer to cook a frozen dinner thoroughly than by not using the product at all. Seems strange, but true !!"
4,Works great...like the old one used to,"This is a really nice product if your microwave doesn't have a turntable. My previous one lasted about 3 years because the part that rotates the table is plastic (probably so they can sell more). When this one breaks, as it is meant to do, my husband will replace the plastic part with metal and it will probably last for years."
3,Fast shipping,"Fast shipping, product as advertised it was a little slow but it did work.Would use merchant again."
4,microwave turntable,"A great product. It fits nicely inside our microwave, and the low profile allows almost any disk to fit inside."
2,"Yes,it does break easily. Have to look for new one","Bought this at Wal-Mart on sale about a year or two ago;has been broken for over one year. I have gone through about three of these;the Nordic Ware turntables are NOT durable and break easily. The Rubbermaid manual turntable broke and they do NOT make a replacement fot THAT anymore. That one lasted for years until I wound it up too tight. Now have to look for a new one,since these wind up turntables are very hard to find except online. Pain in the neck!"
3,Micro Go Round,"The turntable on my microwave broke. Since it's almost cheaper to buy a new one microwave than have the old one fixed, I decided to try the Micro Go Round. While it isn't quite as easy as having the automatic turntable in your microwave, ""winding up"" the Micro-Go-Round seems to be small price to pay compared to having to buy a new microwave. My popcorn no longer burns - what more can you ask???"
2,Nordicware microwave turntable,Hard to rewind. Awkward to handle. Requires flipping upside down to activate. No on/off switch. Does not seem sturdy enough to last.
1,Increases heating time,"We have one of these in the Microwave at my work and I prefer not using it. In fairness to Nordic, I do not know the model, make, or year of our product; just it's name ""Micro-Go-Round."" So I suppose it is possible that the product featured is better than ours. With our unit it increases the time it takes to reheat a meal by as much as 60%. So as I mentioned, I prefer not using it at all, because I can stir my food in much less time. So for someone who is always in a hurry it is a useless product."
2,Not worth the money - returned it,"The turntable in our microwave stopped spinning and to try and avoid replacing it (it's mounted above our stove) I bought this but returned it soon after. I had to wind it every 2 days for as often as I use the microwave--it takes a while to wind, too. Annoying when you need to cook something. Also, it doesn't spin for items under 6oz I think, whoch is a good amount of what I microwave for our toddler. And I dont' think you are supposed to put food directly on it (like a packet of frozen vegs or something) so have to use a lot of plates. :( Overall, not worth $30 for me."
2,Micro Go Round,I just bought my 5th unit -- the first one (bought about 5 years ago) lasted 1 to 2 years. The last 4 units purchased lasted 6 months or less. Relibility has vanished. The internal spring and/or ratchet fail sooner in the newer units. Problem is-- there is nothing else at this price ($30) available. A new microwave oven with a rotating table will be the next purchase.
1,Broken again,"This product does the job it is designed for when it works. Unfortunately it just does not last very long. I've had three because I have an expensive, built-in older microwave that doesn't have a rotator so I really need this type of product. I wish there was an alternative."
1,Microwave go-round.,"Iam sorry to announce that the microwave go-round I purchase doesn't work. I couldn't turn it right or left. I have not return the item become I do not have time. I am very disappointed and would like my refund.Sincerely,Yvonne"
2,Mechanical,"When this game came out, I was a little wary...not sure if i wanted to be disappointed, but unable to NOT rent it. Sigh. Difficulty confirmed. Even when you get the hang of things, you never really do. Everytime you think you have it, the next scene has MORE and bigger, badder enemies. That would be fine if there had been some training in the beginning, something to tell you how to fight combo, sneak successfully. It's pretty straight forward; you follow a path, climbing and burning your way to your goal. Which of course you can't see very far ahead. That's everything wrong without the stiff, mechanical gameplay, nothing new story, and speedchanges.Really if you must try this as a fan, rent it. By the time it's due back, you'll be plenty frusterated. It's games like this that make GOOD ""games like this"" never get made. I guess we'll never get Veronica Mars the game?I recommend the BUFFY game instead! -major Buffy fan"
3,Series Power!,I have to admit that after actually playing the game I was surprised. I hated it even more than I thought I could.Did anyone notice that the war ended about the same time Dark Angel did? Dark Angel was a force that caused human suffering. Every day I wake up and thank the good lord that Jamsey Cameroony isn't in television anymore. Good riddance Dark Angel and good riddance James Cameron [sic?].Please don't unlease anymore licensed [stuff] like Dark Angel the Game on our favourite consoles. ..
2,Don't waste your money!,"I'm amazed that any company would release a game with the HUGE glitches that exist in this one!! The game play is fun, but my kids cringe every time they move from one area to the next fearing it will freeze up, which happens constantly. We're already on our second disk, with no improvement. Shame on you, Nick Games, for releasing an inferior product before the bugs were worked out and disappointing many kids who love SpongeBob!!"
3,OK.........,"This game is OK, but hard (for me). I haven't been able to win the belly flop picture level. I think it will be easier if I don't grab the spongebob letters and just get checks on the ""to do"" list. Before that, the game is easy for me and I especially like the switching tent.All in all, this is an O.K. game but a little hard."
3,This game is fun but it's not worth the money!,"When I bought this game, I read all the reviews for it and they all said the game was alot of fun, but it had a ""few glitches"". Well, when I think glitches, I think the game probably skips or freezes every now and then...but I was wrong. The game freezes almost every time you go to a different level or go in and out of places, and it ""loads"" way too often. Don't get me wrong...the game is fun, but you only have about 10 minutes of game time before it freezes and you have to start all over again. Good luck!"
5,"Interesting, enlightening and informative. Highly recommend.","Although I've been a weekend gardener for twenty years, I still consider myself a beginner. This book is exactly what I was looking for to take my vegetable gardening to the next level. I really enjoy the hummingbirds, butterflys, birds and the preying mantis. It is great to get berries, vegetables, herbs and flowers for grandma in the nursing home. This book is helping me get the most out of my gardens, more in the same amount of space; saving me time and effort. I'd highly recommend it. It is interesting, written as if from a friend."
5,Perfect - Convenient - Tasty - FAST!,"Length:: 1:38 MinsThis is an awesome product!It makes great fluffy quality eggs in under two minutes for a tasty egg muffin. Cooking time varies greatly by microwave wattage. It took me a few attempts to perfect the time. I have a 700 watt microwave so I cook mine for 1:45. My father has a 900 watt oven and cooks his for 1:15. So many microwave cooking items fail to meet expectations, but the Nordic Ware egg muffin cooker does what it claims. Egg quality tastes fabulous. Lots of possibilities for additions, like cheese. Super easy cleanup for this high performance convenience. Highly recommended!"
4,This Works With Large Eggs,"I love the convenience of nuking my eggs and have purchased several different microwave egg cookers. This one is my favorite because you can add two large eggs and not have to worry about overflow. I actually prefer to poach/soft boil my eggs, so I put some water in before adding the eggs which I poke several times with a fork. I haven't quite figured out the timing - I usually end up with one soft boiled egg and one poached - but I'm okay with that. The only hitch is the plastic smell from heating this cooker in the microwave the first couple of times. It does diminish, but that definitely wasn't a pleasant discovery. These are also very easy to clean with soap, water, and a sponge. I would suggest cleaning them as soon as the eggs are removed because it will be a LOT easier."
5,Abandon the arches,"This is probably the favorite cooking gadget that we own. Around here, we take one egg white from a fresh cracked egg... then we take a splash of egg beaters in the middle to provide the yolk... microwave that for one minute (1200w MW) ... all the while toasting a muffin (we like the healthy choice/life/living brand @ 80/90 calorie)... Once the minute is over, put four slices of ham (fresh, budding, whatever) and one slice of American cheese... microwave the whole thing for 15 seconds... once your muffin pops out, transfer it to the muffin, salt to taste and enjoy... yum!"
4,Does the Job,"If you follow the directions, it will do what it's supposed to do. Look at the other reviews for helpful hints. It's funny, but I've only used it once. I promise that I'll use it again sometime. I guess I didn't give it 5 stars because I was expecting it to produce the style of egg made at Micky-D's for the egg-McMuffin sandwiche. The type of egg made with this pan seems a little ""wetter"" to me."
4,"If you don't mind microwaved eggs, this little gadget is perfect","Got this little gadget so my kids can make their own egg sandwiches in the morning. So far, it's worked just fine. The instructions say to scramble an egg or two in the plastic dish prior to nuking it. But I've found two problems with this:1. Having a child do this will result in more egg on the counter than in the dish.2. Two eggs does not produce a good result.I've found that one egg, scrambled in a small bowl first, produces the best result: a fairly fluffy English muffin- or toast-ready egg. Throw on a piece of cheese and forget about the kids asking to go to McD's!"
4,So happy !!!,We lost our old one when we moved house and were delighted to find tha we could buy another one through Anmazon - so we are back to eating bacon again cooked so beautifully in the microwave on the rack !!!!!
5,Works Great. Fast. Easy to Clean.,"This is one of those inexpensive products that exceeds expectations. We use it to make Egg-Beaters egg sandwiches. We just pour the eggs into the pan and pop it into the microwave. The top keeps the eggs from spilling out of the bowl when they cook (eggs expand dramatically during cooking in a microwave), and the pan cleans up very easily (nothing seems to stick to it). The size is perfect for creating an ""egg patty"" that fits a large english muffin or sandwich things. Simple, well-designed, inexpensive product that performs very well."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this to curb my Egg McMuffin cravings, and the one con to this product is that it is too wide for a standard English muffin. My egg was hanging over the muffin's edges by a ridiculous amount, which made it hard to eat and nowhere near the ""grab and go"" sandwich I was hoping for.While the product works, and does easily microwave an egg, it is no better or worse in overall function than theZiploc Container, Extra Small Bowl, 6-Count(Pack of 2). The Ziplocs are also a better size for an English muffin, which means that that's what I'll be using while this takes space in my cabinet."
1,Arrived Broken,"My microwave bacon rack was packed with other microwave items, and the rack arrived broken. I placed a second order for the rack and an order for a book. They were packed together and again, the microwave bacon rack was broken when it arrived. I give up!! The material that the rack is made from appears to be too fragile."
5,Easy,"I love this because my teenage son can fix his own egg muffin sandwich now. It's easy, fast, no greasy necessary and cleans great"
5,A Great game for all ages,A challenge for both young and old. Will have your brain thinking outside the box.
2,Sort of Disappointed,I experimented with the placement of this monitor on my wrist and level of it relative to my heart. It seemed to be relatlive consistent in most all positions but the readings were quite high to what I was accustomed to what my Doctor typically found when blood pressure was checked in his office so he placed a 24 hr monitor on me to record readings about every 15 minutes. The printout of those readings showed very slight variation in my blood pressure but consistently 20-25 points LOWER than what the wrist monitor had been showing. I'v concluded that the wrist monitor is CONSISTENT but reads higher than my actual blood pressure. Knowing this doesn't discourage me from recommending the monitor so long as one is willing to accept this error reading and compensate for it when taking their blood pressure with it.
2,Inconsistant,Easy to use but not consistant. Readings vary making hard to evaluate your condition. Well made for the price.
2,Disappointing,"After reading all of the excellent reviews, I thought I was in store for a great read. The writing itself is not very good. The beginning of the book kept my interest, but the middle and ending were dull. I kept waiting for something gripping to happen, but it never did."
4,"Excellent for Music, Sociology & Religions students!!!","We read selections of this book in my Religion & Popular Culture class. It was excellent. The author carries the theme of African music and it's influence on the rest of our modern music through the whole book and I dig that. It's time all people realized the positive impact our African brothers and sisters have had on music and spirituality. Rap & Hip Hop aren't all about gang violence, and Rave culture isn't all about drugs. This book explores how people relate to music as more than just a good time, but as religion. Music shapes so much of our world today and there is so much negative feedback about the subcultures Sylvan writes about in this book, it's awesome to see new, positive light shed on them ."
5,Transformers,A Christmas gift for my son this year. He asked for it on his Christmas list and he will enjoy it.
5,Perfect for nostalgia,"I've reminisced about this show for years with my friends, and we'd talked about locating the complete series for about as long. I purchased this as a birthday gift, and it was very well received! Aside from the pleasure of re-watching the entire series, that are ample bonus features that we found immensely entertaining as well as interestingly informative. Great buy!"
1,junk,"I bought it as a backup for my canon SD500. But it never works. For the first time I thought because the charger's problem, so I put it back in charger again for another 12 hours. But that only proved it's battery's problem. It may support browse several (not more than 10)pictures. But you never expect it can take one shoot.The only comment is, totally a junk!"
3,Quotes Galore,This person seems to be more interested with Sandburg's writing than with Sandburg. But he definitely has respect for Carl.
2,Carl Sandburg,"Carl Sandburg was a very boring book, to me. It was a biography on a railroad man named Carl. This book started out with a chronology of Carl Sandburg's life. Carl was born in the 1860's and died in the 1960's, at the age of 93. After the chronology of Carl's life, the book resumes onto the beginning of Carl's life. He began as a cheap railroad man. Then, one day when he was about 25, he struck an oil well and became rich. Following, he paid for college and became a great college professor. He taught college until he retired at the age of 85. Eight years later, at the age of 93, Carl Sandburg died. I believe if this book was fictional with a little bit of adventure here and there, it would have been much better. Also, if it had som action at all, to me, the book would have been much better. Overall, I give the book Carl Sandburg, by Richard Crowder, 2 stars."
5,You've been Stung by the Scorpion!!!!!,"This is a [kickin] album with heavy beats and lyrics you can definitely relate too...She's Always Right is one of my favs on this album. This album produced by Moka Only and Rob the Viking and Paul Nice is a heavy hitter no more little leagues for these guys...Moka Only also a talented artist puts in just the right amount of umpf to take this album to the limits it deserves. When you hear Jampacked or Get Stung you will understand what being a Scorpion is all about and the fact all three of the main artists are all ""Scorpios"" it gives it a sound like no other hip hop album to date..If you haven't heard this album go out right now and get it you will not regret it and you'll be hangin on every word waiting for the next track to play.... ""And ThatYou Can Quote""..........Moira"
3,I don't know,It's cool.........nevermind....I haven't played it yet.....I'm Justin....I'm azn too......bye......................
2,Not Good,All this is poppy rocky cock! I hate this new sound rock. This is not a good album and nor was the last. If you want to listen to some good form of rock music then listen to the Foo Fighters. I suggest that you dont buy this album and if you know someone who has got it then kill them.
3,Small,Live the looks but for the price it was small looks bad in my 55gollan tank looks bigger in pic
4,"more like 3 and a half, but hey Amazon isn't letting me","Lori Carson has a beautiful voice and can write some definitely pleaseing melodies. It's a very easy album to get into. If you're not in the mood for something too heavy, get this album. But if you're looking for a talented lyricist, look somewhere else. The major error in ""Stars"" is her songwriting. Songs like ""Head in a Box"" start out with pretty good lyrics, but then Lori falters as if she's singing the song for the first time and singing the first thing that comes to her mind. Which I have no doubt, she probably does take whatever first comes to her mind. But with pretty instrumentation and that simply delicate voice, Stars is a definite good buy. Suggested tracks to download would be: the title track, Rainy Day, or Caroline."
5,Excellent Product!,"This is the fourth one of these I have purchased. Keep buying them for family members, I have enjoyed mine so much!"
2,"I wanted it to work, but...","Well, my first few attempts were OK. However, I struggled to avoid explosions. Then I broke the clips that provide the hinge and now the top blows off. Obviously, my breaking it was not the manufacturer's fault (altough the clips were rather brittle and not very robust), but it only lasted about 5 attempts and is now useless. More of a miss than a hit, sadly."
4,"Easy, fast, messy way to cook eggs","The nice things about this egg poacher is that it is FAST. Poached eggs in about a minute!It's messy though because it does not sit stable on only three points of contact and is easy to tip over, especially when closing the lid. With a little practice you can avoid making a mess though."
