1,Does Not Work with 5th Generation iPod Nano,"Despite claims to the contrary on the packaging and even in the technical details here on Amazon, this cable DOES NOT work with the 5th generation iPod Nano."
1,Does not work with Ipod Touch 2G,"I wish I could say that it works with an Ipod Touch 2G, but it does not, which is why I bought it. At least the wife has a Nano, and it works with that one."
3,Mostly works,"Works perfectly with classic iPod. Does NOT work with iPhone. Worth the wee cost, but Ill still find a solution that's more flexible."
4,Definitely buy it!!,"A great book, best thing i loved about it were the case studies...it has around atleast three cases for each chapter (and full length cases like 2-8 pages, not those single problem 1 paragraph cases). Learn soooo much more by the cases cuz they emphasize the decisions taken by the controller and the criteria used to choose among alternatives. If you got a good facillatator to guide discussion, you can get seriously engaged in the case study, especially if there are others with counter views...get the book, or you can also get one of the older editions and a used one is real cheap, not that much changes bw the editions, ive got the latest 12th edition, a 10th edition and also an Indian edition by Tata McGrawhill."
4,Satisfied,I was very pleased with the condition of this book. It was like new condition. The book was recieved in a timely manner. I would purchase from this seller again.
4,The dark side of the (technology) force,"I enjoyed ULTERIOR MOTIVE both as a fast paced mystery/thriller and as a behind the scenes look at the Technology industry. For example, it is interesting how programmers leave 'back doors' open to supposedly secure systems that they or people in the know can enter at will, but this can be used by the bad guys as well as the good guys. And as they power of computers grow and integrate into our daily lives, the danger increases that sinister individuals and conspirators can turn this energy against society. For a first novel Ulterior Motive is a great start for someone who may be etertaining and educating us for years to come."
3,Pretty,"Tony has done beautiful photography in nature, great for calendars, greeting cards. If that is what you want, Tony covers with many photograhphic treats.I want more serious landscape photographic examples, so will look elsewhere for more profound content. It is a matter of taste and philosophy."
3,LOOK BEFORE YOU PURCHASE,"THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TAPE, BUT I NEED TO LOOK WHEN I ORDER SOMETHING CAREFULLY. I HAVEN'T HAD A VCR IN MANY YEARS AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IS WHAT IT WAS SO I CAN'T USE IT. MY FAULT LOOK CLOSE BEFORE YOU ORDER."
4,Same as all of Sitchin's books,This book is about Sitchin's theories. If you're into Sitchin's books you'll like this book.
5,haven't finished it yet but i like it,it's a good book. buy it. not often you find a fantasy novel where the dragon's the central character.
1,buyer beware,"This is not a review on the specific treadmill. I am an owner of a bladez treadmill and I want to let people know that if your treadmill breaks down it is VERY hard to service. People don't carry parts for these treadmills b/c they are not well known. We had to order parts from BH North America - they charged us 123 dollars for 2 parts, and then when I called to find out where the parts were almost two weeks later they notified me one part was on back order. He could not tell me when I could expect the part - 'sometimes it takes one month sometimes six' was what I was told. There was NO apology for my wait, no response when I asked for a discount on my parts b/c of the wait, and most importantly no phone call to tell me that my part was back ordered (but they didn't forget to charge me!) I suggest looking at treadmills that are more popular...I wish I had."
3,No noticeable difference in mood,"I work in a credit department call center and have GAD, so I try to control my anxiety by using deep breathing techniques, limiting caffeine, and the occasional mild pharmaceutical at the onset of a panic attack. I thought taking this would be a good substitute for previously suggested antidepressants, but I noticed no difference in mood, energy level, or anxiety. I took this for 2 months and felt no noticeable difference in anything. I'm sure there are benefits to immune system or other areas, but it did not do what I was hoping it would do. I wasn't looking for a miracle drug, but based on prior reviews I thought this would take the edge off. I am disappointed, but I would recommend someone who is considering this to at least try it because everything works differently for everyone, especially when it comes to medication and supplements."
2,PP&M's First Album,"I'm a huge PP&M fan going back to the beginning. My interest in the group has peaked with the recent and tragic death of Mary Travers. This is their first album (""Peter Paul and Mary"" - 1963) and was, frankly, pretty rough, both artisticly and technically. We see a huge improvement in their subsequent albums resulting in the Peter Paul and Mary phenomenon throughout our country and the world for these many years. How lucky we all are to have them in our hearts. My highest reccomendations for their next two albums, ""Moving"" and ""In the Wind""."
1,"Hard to use, Made in China","The blades are very thick so it's difficult to cut cold butter chunks, the ergonomics are quite strange, and it has sharp corners at the base that scratch the bowl. It is a very strong blender, but the blades still bend. I found an old Ecko brand pastry blender at a thrift store that actually works much better without bending into a pretzel."
1,Poor Quality Poor Value Ripped off,"I have built many things in my life (engines, fences, gates, etc) so I have some experience.This product is a piece of junk.Heads of soft metal hex head screws turn to round head screwsScrews strip into the wood (no bite, just turn)Wood splits and cracksI really feel cheated by this."
3,It's Okay,I had to go to the hardware store to buy longer screws.Then we found we didn't have enough scews and had to go get more for another section.
3,Nice shelf but a problem putting together,"The shelf is nice. However, the ""pre-drilled"" holes were way to small for the screws the manufacturer supplied. If you try to use the hex wrench supplied without re-drilling the ""pre-drilled"" holes, both the hex wrench and the screw head will strip and you will have a problem since you can not at this point tighten down the parts. So if you buy this shelf make sure you have your drill out. Once you re-drill the holes it's a breeze."
4,Better than the first!,"This was a really great book! I thought it was a lot better than Dark Lord of Derkholm. Year of the Griffin flows a lot better and is more enjoyable. Dark Lord of Derkholm feels kind of depressing. The one complaint I have about Year of the Griffin is the end. Everyone finds their ""perfect partner"" within 20 pages. How realistic is that? What I think happened is that Diana Wynne Jones wasn't allowed to go over 400 pages by her publisher, so she had to wrap everything up quickly. JUst my opinion. You should definitely read thsi book!"
2,This is a ridiculous concept,"ugh! Think of a mix of early 90's alternative stars and underground bands covering some mid-70's K-TEL 'greatest hits'. The Smashing Pumpkins blow some fuzz into 'Jackie Blue', and some of the other songs are amusing, but really, you should have better things to spend your money on."
3,How far does it reach?,"I thought we would get a couple miles of reach with this radio, but we have to be fairly close to use it."
2,Problem where you have other phones on the same line,"Works well except that when there's an incoming call that is picked up in one of the other phones in the house and it's for me, when I pick up my phone (the one connected to Comswitch)all I get is a busy signal. To pick up the call, I have to use another phone in another room. Is there a solution?"
4,ComSwitch 5500,I have had a ComSwitch 5500 before. They work very well in allowing you to have a phone and fax on one phone line. It saves 50 bucks a month or more in having a dedicated phone line just for the fax.
3,SEI Freestanding Jewelry Armoire,"It broke before I could get it out of the box. I did manage to fix it, but the wood that holds the drawers in place came loose before it was put together also. I had to reglue them. It is very pretty though."
1,Wrong Turn,"I wish to enlighted interested readers to an important point: there is another book on this subject by the same name, Turning Japanese: Memoirs of a Sansei, by David Mura. Vive la difference! While Galef's attempt at the gaijin novel may be entertaining to those who don't know better, it is hardly the best book on the subject; it may not even be an okay one. Mura's book, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. No wonder. Mura is one of Japanese-America's foremost poet/authors. He wrote the book while working in Japan on a literary fellowship. It is a masterful work of creative nonfiction, relentlessly honest and achingly authentic. Couldn't put it down. And I've read so many books on the same subject that I'm beginning to think that I'M turning Japanese. I also lived there for 13 years, working in the word biz, so I know whereof I speak. Please read Mura's book. Then decide for yourself."
2,WRT54GR Wireless Access Issue,"Don't buy this router. I purchased this router because I wanted the latest technology, and it looked ""cooler"" than the other router designs.The router works great with my wired desktop, and new Dell wireless laptop. The speed is incredible. However, when you try to connect more than 1 wireless laptop, that has an older wireless adapter, you will have problems connecting. The laptops will hang at ""acquiring network address"". If you turn on both laptops, then things will connect.Please visit the linksys website, and do a search for ""WRT54GR""...you will see what I am talking about.[...]The site below is a third party linksys support site. They don't even rate this router:[...]Bottom line, look elsewhere."
1,NO SUCCESS WITH COMCAST HIGH SPEED,"This product obviously lacks validation testing and ships with and unusable hardware/software package.As a software consultant for 5 years and now a electronics technical program manager, I have set up a few wireless routers over the years. This product just did not work. I spent 1 hour with Comcast until we figured out that the router was not handling the IP address correctly. I then spent 1.5 hours with Linksys changing a huge number of settings with power-downs at every step. IE never connected, although we could ping yahoo.com successfully. LINKSYS - PUT YOUR PRODUCTS TOGETHER BEFORE YOU SHIP THEM."
3,Pretty flimsy stuff!,It does tear easily and evenly ... but that is because it is really very flimsy. Probably best for decorative purposes only.
5,Fun toy,"My son got this at Christmas. He just turned 11. He likes it a lot. It can not pick up anything with much weight. Can pick up socks, very light items. It needs full battery power to work, however, he has a blast with it. It is very mechanical and robotic in it's manuevers."
1,Not impressed,"From page 246 ""it's become clear that strict avoidance of dietary sugar is unnecessary"". The same page speaks about including ""refined sugar"" in your diet, and having the ""occasional cookie"". I now tightly control my blood sugar using the method taught in Richard Bernstein's book ""The Diabetes Solution"". Buy Dr Bernstein's book instead, and you might be very surprised at the counter arguements to the high carb diets that have lead to the thinking that diabetics should enjoy refined sugar."
2,too small of a pan,MOST ANGEL FOOD CAKE MIXES CALL FOR A A PAN HIGHER 10 INCHES AND THIS PAN IS ONLY 9 SO IT DOES NOT TURN OUT VERY WELL .
5,Bob Hope Double Feature,"""My Favorite Blonde"" is great Bob Hope in every sense of the word. Nothing much else said would be necessary.The real gem of this collection is ""Star Spangled Rhythm"". Some may balk at this but pay attention, there's some really great gags, not to mention the songs and skits that all the Paramount stars put on. You have to see to believe the bit with Betty Hutton and the two gents who try to help her get over the wall into the Paramount lot!This film isn't an exclusive Bob Hope comedy except that he hosts the show for the Navy ship's crew and does one skit with William Bendix. Make sure you take this show in the proper context of when it was made and don't put 21st Century ""values"" on it."
3,A little disappointed,"Pros: appearance, lightweight, no whistleCons: doesn't work real well on smooth top ranges, heat setting between medium and low is slow coming to a boil, stationery handleI would recommend for those not cooking on a smooth top electric range"
4,Needs a whistle,This is a beautiful tea kettle and heats up quickly. The only downsideis that it doesn't whistle. For some it's probably not a problem butfor me it would be a great reminder that the water is ready!
1,"Only 1.5 qt, not 2.5 qt","It clearly states on the box 1.5 qt, not 2.5 as Copco and Amazon states. The max fill line in below the spout. Perhaps 2.5 qt to the top, but directions say otherwise. Just filled out my form to return and will ship back tomorrow. Customer returns are easy through Amazon at least."
5,Well worth the money,"An excellent teakettle for the money. Holds 2.5 quarts, and has an opening large enough to get your hand into to dry and wash the inside. Directions do state not to allow water to stand in it for prolonged periods because it will rust over time. This isn't a problem with the large opening. This one doesn't have a whistle - and the handle stays cool to the touch. Easy to fill, easy to clean, and easy on the wallet. Good value overall."
2,No whistle,"This tea pot does not whistle and puts out a lot of steam on my cabinets, which I don't think is good for them. I'll be shopping for another kettle that has a plug in the front that whistles and doesn't coat my cabinets. It's a shame, because this stainless steel kettle wasn't cheap.Would advise you shop elsewhere."
4,Great Amount for Your Value!!!,Item came packaged exactly how you see it! Surprised by the weight but impressed by the amount of bungee cords inside. A gift to my boyfriend. We have not had a chance to use them yet but hopefully will soon. A great accessorie to have in the back of the truck!!
1,This doily book isn't for everyone,"C'mon ladies, let's get real here - anyone serious about doilies will know this book is just doesn't cut it. There are absolutely no chapters on the art of speed crocheting nor doily folk lore. Also, some of the patterns in this book are so elementary they could be created by a someone who is only a class I or II doily maker. If you want a real doily book, check out ""Give me Doilies, or Give me Death"" by Mike Johnson - you won't regret it."
5,unique release by rapoon,"Navigating By Colour is Rapoon's most unique release. It has ambient recordings that are musical, dark, ethereal, long, short, beautiful & noisy. This is the recording that contains ""IMAGINE"", his best piece & one of the best ambient pieces ever! Try to find the original release with some of Robin Storey's artwork cards."
1,Terrible!,"The fan does not have enough power to blow the fabric flames! All they do is flop over and hardly move. At no point, does this product even resemble the photo on the site!"
5,Great Childrens' Book,"Not only does this adorably written book capture the essence of a child's relationship with God, I loved the way the illustrations portray the carefree and sweet nature of the children in the story."
4,A Short and Insightful Read,"Whether knocking on doors or meeting folks at the county fair, the best way to persuade people is the personal way. In this short but sweet book, former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neil shares a lifetime of stories to illustrate this important lesson. Even if you aren't an avid reader, you'll find it difficult to put this book down."
2,Paleface: good score,"The PalefaceMildly amusing comedy. Jane Russell is fine as Calamity Jane, whose show it is. Script is very weak, and Bob Hope is limited by it, not finding much room for ad-libs or one liners. Really, the only merit of the show is the lead song, Buttons and Bows, which was much covered (and much better done in covers) at the time. The Buttons and Bows music runs through the score as a theme."
4,Altec Lansing,"This product was everything it was described to be. Its light, mobile, and has very good sound quality. If I had an opportunity to change anything on the product, I would like to have more volume from the speakers."
5,Small but Great,"The small size of the IM510 may be misleading. The sound is clean and sharp and suitable for those who are not after a heavy bass. It works well with the Sansa MP3 - both clip+ and the Fuze. The Jazz records (guitar+hammond organ or tenor+organ+guitar, or tenor+piano+guitar combos), I play on the MP3 sound great with the speaker. Highy recommended."
5,Great compact speaker system,"This is excactly what I was looking for, a small compact speaker for my Sansa MP3. And the sound quality is great. I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Broke after 8 months,"I have had this for about 8 months now and the speakers just quit on me the other day. They had very little volume when they did work and now all I hear is loud buzzing. I wish I had not wasted my money. If you do buy this, do yourself a favor and save all documentation for the eventual return you WILL make."
1,Bad business,I received this product and it did not work. I have yet to receive an e-mail from the vendor and I would recommend that you warn others about this vendor.
2,Altec Lansing IM510 Speaker System,"Difficult to use when coordinating two pieces of electronics. The Sansa 250e did not play when plugged in to the unit. When I contacted Altec about the problem, I got a surly tech person, after the innumerable phone button presses, who told me, in barely intelligable English, I should update software on the Sansa 250e. I contacted the pleasant and helpful people at Sansa and did indeed upgrade the software successfully and am able to play the unit over the Altec speaker system. Since my experience with Altec, I do not expect that I will be seeking out Altec products anytime in the future, near or distant."
2,overpriced and tiny!,"i was thinking about taking this unit to work, but i don't work in a LIBRARY! the drone of machinery and my co-worker's radios will squelch this device's output leaving me straining to hear its contribution to the din. do not doubt that this is a glorified transistor radio, it's light and very portable. it does have handy appliances and it is pretty. it is lacking both power and substance that the price demands.this ""radio"" strikes me as a gimmick gift for opening a bank account or filling out a credit card application."
3,IM510 Comments,"I thought the product was OK and certainly was easy to use. However, my husband is a musician and he thought the sound was ""tinny"" sounding. He did not want to pay extra for the bass that is listed as an option. Overall, I probably would have kept the speaker system just to be able to listen to the music without having to put on the head phones but like my husband said, for that matter, we could put the CD's on and listen to them. We did not download music but had put our own CD's on the MP3 player."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY!,"This item fit my grandson perfectly; however, before he had worn it for an hour, the seams were coming apart in the back seat area. Soooooo disappointed. He loves Superman and wants to wear it, but it was rags before a few hours were over."
5,GREAT COSTUME - GREAT VALUE,"This costume was great - WARNING - runs much smaller than advertised. I got the 2-5 and it fits my 1 year old with clothes on (who is about the size of a 2 year old). It would have stretched a little bit more but not enough to fit my four year old daughter for sure. This was an adorable outfit that got lots of compliments. It was comfortable and stretchy on him, too thin to wear without clothes. Great value for the $$ for sure!"
4,Great to carry around small knitting project,"I bought this as a ""to-go"" bag for my current knitting projects. There are tons of pockets and places to store everything, however, the main compartment is somewhat small to carry a medium-sized project or ball of yarn. Overall I really like it, it is very durable and sturdy."
1,Not worth anything,"I got this and it didn't work. I returned it and got a second unit, and it didn't work either. They didn't have any replacements after that, so I got my money back."
1,disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the condition of this book. The book itself is wonderful that is why I purchased it. I thought I was buying a new book, at least that was what it stated, but when I received it it was anything but new. It even has inscription inside it. I intended to give this as a Christmas present, but not with someone else's name in it. Most likely I will not make this same mistake again in buying something that is suppose to be new and turns out isn't. Disappointed really is going easy, I was so excited in buying this book, thought it would be the perfect gift, turns out I was very wrong."
3,Replacement Filters,Probably what I should have expected. But the filters are floppy and difficult to insert without it getting wavy and poorly fitting.
5,Filters,I can only comment on the delivery and order process since I have not used the product yet. All went smooth with both. I hope to begin using the product soon.
5,great set,"if all you want are the Harry Potter movies, this is a phenomenal buy! Outstanding! Exactly what my husband and I wanted......hopefully will watch them with our grandsons in a few years!"
4,Great Movie,Great movie series and quality at a bargain price. Received this in a very timely basis and my family has enjoyed it from that point on.
2,Mixed fixings.,"I love all of the movies, but we opened this and found the cas was ripped apart with a huge made in Mexico sticker on it. Bad quaility but we kept it because the movies play nicely. Bad case construction though."
4,Exactly as advertised,"Arrived quickly, great price, exactly as advertised. Chose DVD over Blue Ray for price and also to be used on a computer"
2,Took Out Scenes!!,"This box set not only is the worst box set I have every bought but it is for my favorite series, which made it even more dissapointing. They take scenes OUT of the movies, that played in the theatrical version, and put them in deleted scenes. You have no option to play with deleted scenes or the theatrical version. The cover art on the CDs is the exact same as the CDs from the individual released movies. They just threw it together to make some money for christmas. They are releasing a better collection set version later this year and I would save your money for that!"
2,2 discs don't work,"Six of the eight work great, but when you want a whole series and two of the disks keep skipping it really ticks you off!"
4,Harry Potter Bluray.,"I would recommend this product to all Harry Potter fans. It is one of the greatest piece of literature of all time. My only problem is not the Bluray disc but the case is comes in. The case is plastic and broke after opening it. The discs are hard to remove and without proper hand eye coordination, you can actually break one of the disc because the case is terribly made. Other than that, Great movies series."
5,Harry Potter movie collection,"Good quality, not much in the way of 'liner' information,but it does cover a brief review of each movie. Would like more bio info of the actor"
5,Harry Potter Box Set,All movies are there. Great price. No complaints. Recommend it to anyone who is interested! I wish I could give it a million stars really!
4,"Excellent movies, but...","I read the reviews for this box set and was initially disappointed, to the extent that I nearly didn't order. After all, I have the movies on DVD, and my Blu-Ray player does a great job of upscaling, so the Blu-Ray version is not strictly necessary for me. That said, the Blu-Ray is just a better all-around experience given the choice. The price seems alright for this set, but I did better, thus the 4-star rating and not 5. Instead of ordering this box set, I went to the UK Amazon website and bought it there (amazon.co.uk) for about half the price. An excellent option, considering I got all 8 movies and additional special feature content for around $45 (and region-free discs)."
5,Great Deal!,These movies are great for the family and the price was excellent! I highly recommend this collection! We will watch these over and over!
5,Great buy.,Order arrived very quickly and was exactly what I was expecting. Very cheap for the amout of product. Well worth it. A great buy.
2,Not Happy,When I receive these movies 3 of them didn't even work. I had to go buy individual Harry Potter movies that actually worked to complete my collection
2,2 Discs don't work; Seller says it's not their problem,"Ordered this as a Christmas Gift and apparently we should have just watched all the freaking movies immediately, despite schedules that wouldn't allow, because the last two DO NOT WORK and when I filed a complaint the seller prettymuch told me that my beef was with the manufacturer and not them. Extremely irritated and disappointed. What a waste of money."
5,Just what we wanted!,We wanted a box set with all the movies in it. That's what we got! :) It's nice to have them all together and on Blu-Ray. Quick delivery too!
5,Complete set without the fluff.,"I bought this set because I didn't want all the extra scenes, special features, etc.. If you want all the extras, they are certainly available. If you enjoy the movies then this set allows you to dive right in. It meets my needs, the blu-ray is fabulous and it's everything I expected."
5,Potter on blu-ray,"Held off on this purchase until all of the films were compete and on blu-ray. They look great! Good picture, great audio, a few extras that are available on blu-ray only....as usual, I shopped around and Amazon beat everyone's price that I could find! Completely satisfied! Come in an all inclusive case that is not very bulky...as wide as two standard cases, but has all 8 blu-rays!Art work is just neat-o!"
3,Case broken,"When my son opened this item on Christmas morning, the case was broken. I had not opened it beforehand, expecting it to be intact."
5,Phenomenal boxed set,The complete Harry Potter collection of DVDs is a phenomenal addition to my DVD collection. Loved that they came in a singular case and that each was available as part of the set.
5,My son loves these movies,the package came on time as ordered- blue ray 8 discs at a great price. would recommend it for anyone who likes Harry Potter!
3,Did the trick,"A couple of the dvds stop in the middle in a few spots so I need to retract them. Otherwise, good. Reasonable. Son loves them.Selller good. Prompt communication and delivery. Nice to have a complete set."
2,Rotten Packaging,"The packaging for this set is absolutely rotten. It's one of those ""hinged"" multi-sets with 8 discs. It needs to have an outside box with 8 slimline cases, one for each movie, inside. Those hinged containers break too easily (I know, I just received my order with broken hinges).W A Hopkins"
1,Warner please don't waste our time,"I had the feeling they were going to do this when they kept with the box sets 1-5, 1-6, and 1-7. Come on really all but 1 movie. So not a surprise that they would give a bare bone 1-8 to start. I avoided dipping into the Blu Ray Harry Potters knowing I would end up double dipping for the Ultimate collection of all 8 films. I guess next Christmas we will see the 1-8 with all the deleted scenes and with any luck extended viewing instead of just seperate features. So Warner please stop wasting our time, just get with the picture and give us the real complete set."
1,Is this a bootleg?,"I have purchased many dvds and blu rays from Amazon over the years with no issue. I am completely appalled by the quality of the Harry Potter blu rays I received. I purchased them as a gift for family members. Half of the discs don't work, others skip throughout the movie. I've tried countless other blu ray discs and other players. I am confident that it is the discs.Additionally, the discs don't have menus, scene selection, etc. Which makes me seriously question the quality from which they came. I was under the assumption that these were official Warner Bros Blu Ray discs, but the manner in which they appear makes me think otherwise."
2,Not a true collection,This set is just a hodge-podge of extra discs that were laying around that didn't sell. They ARE blue ray. They are legit movies. The Order of The Phoenix disc says Disk 1 on it. The Hallows Part 1 looks like a photocopy label. There isn't a Main Menu in the first 5 disks - You have to use the remote to bring it up. Very Disappointed. It's all the movies in one box - that's all .....
5,Love it!,My daughter wanted this for Christmas. It was one of her favorite gifts! It's so nice to have the entire set in one collection. I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fan.
1,Not the US edition,Check and make sure you received the US edition before you unwrap it. I received the European edition and promptly went on-line and received a return authorization and shipping label from Amazon.
2,Not impressed...,"I, like many others, had been waiting for the whole collection to be released. The fact that there are not many special features does not bother me. What does bother me is the simple fact that Warner Brothers rushed this out too soon. The images on the discs are pulled right from the old ones (The Half Blood Prince has disc 1 on it, when there is only one disc). The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a plain black disc with no image. It took me forever to get the Deathly Hallows Part 1 to play because it kept bringing me back to my blu ray player's home screen. I will be calling Amazon customer service and probably returning this."
2,Why does the UK get the better and less expensive set??,"I really don't understand why amazon.co.uk is offering the same set, more or less, for much less money *AND* they are offering the 3D version as well. Frankly, this would not be as big a franchise without US money and yet we are the ones getting nickled and dimed! No sooner will this less than stellar version be released before WB re-releases another set for more money! Two stars just because of the packaging and pricing. The price has *increased* $10 since the pre-order started."
4,Gave it as gift.,"Gave it as a gift, my little brother was happy with it. We (the whole family) put the first one in Christmas afternoon. We all enjoyed it."
4,Love the movies,"4 stars only because this particular set didn't come with all the extras along the way (things like making of, behind the scenes, etc.) Other than that this is a must have."
1,got ripped off,They claim to send all of the movies but i only got the first 4. then when i sent them a message about it nobody has contacted me back. dont do it.
4,thorvaald,The product was as advertised. I wish they had incuded an appendices similar to the the ome included with the Lord Of The Rings. But it was otherwise fine.
1,Go to [ ... ],I'm glad there is going to be a box set.....but you can get this same bluray boxset (region free...so it will play on players in this country) at the Amazon UK site for way less. They show it being 32.20GBP....when at checkout the total came out to 30.00GPB....which coverted to U.S Dollars was like $47 for all 8 films (including shipping). This is only about $20 more than buying the last film alone. Don't waste your money on this one....and you still receive pre-order price guarantee...so it may end up being even less! Be a wise shopper.
5,"Great Product, Great Price!","The hot sock diffuse does exactly what it is supposed to. I have curly, frizzy hair and so the hot sock is perfect for allowing my hair to get the perfect curl. I read other people's reviews that it was too big for their hair dryer. I own an old Revlon hair dryer and the hot sock fit on it perfectly. You can't go wrong with this product for the price."
4,Gets the job done.,"I purchased the Hot Sock diffuser for my recent trip to the UK and Ireland. It packs well, and it fit on every dryer I used. I had no problems keeping it on. Of course, it doesn't work as well as a proper bowl diffuser, but it kept my wavy/curly hair from getting too blown around during the drying process. I will absolutely travel with it again.I knocked off one star because the pink thread that holds the seam together at the opening started to unravel almost immediately. That hasn't affected its performance (yet), and for the price I paid, I really shouldn't be surprised... but I'm withholding a perfect score nevertheless."
4,Comparable to my Diffuser,"I purchased this item based on a recommendation from a fellow curly-haired friend. I typically use my diffuser and found this to be a nice alternative. I don't see much difference in my hair when I use a diffuser vs. hot sock. Probably because I dry my hair 1/2 with heat, and then let it air dry the rest of the way."
3,Finding stations is hard,"Service was great on receiving the clock radio. I love the 5-2 alarm feature. I have trouble finding some radio stations on the dial, even major stations."
2,It's just ok not great,"I purchased two of these systems because I live in two places. I live in my house and on a university campus. It has a very good mp3 player jack. you can hook a laptop to it and watch a movie with friends and such if you like or whatever. However, the buzzer is not very loud compared to it's radio. So becarefull if you are a heavy sleeper. Of the two the color change button only works properly on one. Also brand new batteries wil not put the low battery flashing light out. It just keeps on flashing. I dont really use the radio since I have a Zen Vision M but you will definetly have to read the manual to set this clock for your first time becasue it isn't going to give you hints. Overall it is merely ok."
2,Not a charger nor CD player,This isn't a bad item. I misread the product description. It is not a cd player nor does it charge the ipod. I would have been happy with one or the other.
2,A Case Study In Bad Industrial Design,"After looking around for what seemed like ages, I was thrilled to finally find an affordable alarm clock with a ""line in"" jack for iPods, etc. Unfortunately, the benefit of plugging in your iPod is grossly outweighed by its counter-intuitive button placement. And forget about figuring out which buttons do what, especially when it's the first thing in the morning. Setting both the time and alarm is also way more difficult than it needs to be. It's clear that Timex put the (none too pleasing) form before the function with this alarm clock. Give it a pass."
3,"Connects ok, but voulume way to low",It's ok for moderate level listening. But if you're looking to jam the music...stay away. The volume is wayyy to low for my taste.
3,Decent Sound - Not without Connection Issues,"I use the HT820 headphones mostly with a 2003 Toshiba laptop. When the laptop and headphones connect successfully, the sound is fairly decent. The connection, however, is quirky to initiate and once initiated is interrupted with intermittent sound breaks occurring every 15 to 25 minutes. This is a bit annoying. Admittedly, this could be caused by the laptop as it is quite dated and did not come with bluetooth capabilities. I installed a USB bluetooth adatper and software (includes A2DP profile) from Targus (Model ACB10US). Perhaps an OEM bluetooth-enabled laptop would establish a better connection with the headphones."
2,very uncomfortable,"sound isn't great. i'll give it a 3 out of 5 for using it with my laptop listening to music. there's hardly any bass. its very uncomfortable to the ears after a couple of minutes. it feels like its blocking the blood flow to my ears. its not for hardcore music lover. i was just watching a movie with it and now my ears feels like its just recovering from an injury. i just couldn't take it anymore after the movie so i had to write this so i can warn people to avoid this product. the cushion was also very annoying, it keeps dropping off. i almost lost it several times so i just glue it on the headset. its really awful. i've also used it with my MOTOROLA razr to talk to my friends and they keep telling me that there hear a constant noise. too bad for me that before i got fed up by using this, its too late to return it. for your own sake, buy another BT headset. and if you find it very comfortable and has a really good sound, feel free to share it to us.thanks."
1,all about it,"it sounds really great , but these are very huge , it makes you feel like u have an extra pair of dumbles around ur ears , dont get me wrong it is great if you want to build up some muscles therse !!!it didnt work with my n80 nokia , however the n80 has one of the best music features on phones , and te mic is too low and u some times need to speak louder for some one to hear u NORMALLY ...for the computer my bluetooth on computer i kept getting crackling souunds , reminds me of the old radio where it crackeles ... but through the wire that came with it it was awesome , just like a good quality headset for computers , though u cant use the mic there ....check ur device qualifications 3 times before u get thisand remember in no time ull have great ear muscles but months of ear pain"
2,Razr Owners Beware,"I recently purchased this product in order to listen to my mp3s on my razr v3i while I'm at the gym, unfortunately my phone does not have the bluetooth technology that is necessary to play music with this headset. I'm able to listen to phone calls, but not mp3s, because the music needs to be in a special format that's compatible with the headset.Hope this was helpful to you.Good luck,Jay Pee"
2,Good sound bad construction,"I used these headphones with the HTC Advantage 7501 and it worked very well. The sound was very good and the controls worked as advertised. However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one. Motorola said they don't sell the ear pads separately and apologized for the inconvenience. They were a bit uncomfortable with the ear pads so obviously without one the headphones were unusable. Seems like a design flaw to me and I feel a bit ripped off. If you do decide to purchase this product I would immediately glue them in place."
3,Good sound but I find uncomfortable,"They work great, sound great, and make my ears hurt after a while. Sound and phone functions all work with Samsung A707 (cync), but after 30-45 minutes my ears are aching where the headphones contact and hang on my ears. I can keep repositioning them and get some more time, but eventually I give up and try again later. So far (>2 weeks) I have not been able to build up muscles or calluses for longer wearing. Others seem to find them comfortable, so good luck."
3,HT820,"The headset are beatifull, it works very well, but you have to buy another bluetooth divece if you want to listen the music from your computer not just any bluetooth adapter.I have a E1 Rokr, I can have a fluid conversation but when I try to listen my music it dosen't work."
2,Now Listen Up,"Ok. I am writing this as a broadway lover and not as a christian (which I am). Ok, first off let me tell you that this album SUCKS. There are one or two good songs, but other than than, it sounds like the 80's revisited. The music is horrible with synthesizers and over produced vocals (what is it with the continous echoes when they sing?) It just sounds like they grabed a few christian artists with good voices, through them in a recording booth and said SING. There is almost no emotion in this. The reason I gave this cd two stars is for the effort in trying to put a christian show on broadway ran by and starring Christians. But with this material, it is going to be gone real quick if it is not already gone from broadway. If you want a true ROCK OPERA about Jesus, go buy ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" or ""Godspell."" Those are the classics and for good reason. Please, please, please save your money. I can not stress this enough. IT is not even worth it."
4,Praise the Lord for teachers!,"I love this book! Brother Howard Carter, who mentioned by the Late Lester Sumrall, who blessed Brother Sumrall equal to the blessing he received from Apostle of Faith Smith Wigglesworth, is a great man of God. Eventhough he's deceased, he being dead yet speaketh. The information in this book is excellent. Frequently asked questions such as tongues being used to speak another nation's language, or gifts of healing and working of miracles being the same or not, are answered in this book. It is a great book to study upon besides 1 Corinthians 12th chapter in the bible. IN verse 28, is says that God has placed some in the church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly teachers. This man is a teacher filled with the Holy Ghost and faith. This book is a definite buy if you want to study up on the gifts of the Spirit."
2,Do not buy if you are dealing with male infertility.,"This book was a good book and very informative. However if you are dealing with male infertility this book is not for you. It is very informative when it comes to ivf procedures but there are very few chapters you'll benefit from. The author tells her own struggles with infertility. Her struggles were all related to egg production and endometriosis. Her husband did have a few problems when with shape of sperm, but it did not pose a problem.She does talk about adoption as well."
3,not for untreatable infertility,"As someone suffering from ovarian failure, this book offered me little help. There was a small section on pof and a small section on adoption. There is very little about the options and the emotions associated with having no hope at all. The author's style is conversational, and the book could feel like a support group for those who are going through IVF. A better title would be The IVF Survival Handbook."
4,Good For Serious Writers,"Jimmy Webb incorporates interesting and sometimes funny stories in the book for those of us who do not plan to write music. But, it can get technical in some chapters of the book; a good read for budding songwriters."
3,Carolyn,"I bought this book thinking it was a ""hardback"" and it was not. I was sent the paperback. It is the title or book needed for my class, just not hardback. If I had known this seller was selling the soft copy and not the hardback as was listed on their listing, I would not have paid as much for the book.I do not start the class until the end of this week, so I do not know how great a book it is. The author is one that has a very good writing style for students to learn from in his other books. The book seems from just looking through it to give a good overview of the sciences at the junior college level. I am not sure how good it would be for science majors."
2,Everyday Calm: Relaxing Rituals for Busy People,This was not a very clear cut book. It does have some suggestions but all the having to go here to this page and there to that page for the suggested ritural made it not so user friendly.
1,Poop n Stuff,"For those of my generation who might be seeking a blast from the past, warm and fuzzy childhood nostolgia trip, don't bother!!! If it were possible to give this cd no stars, I would. There is only one song with Cass Elliot, that is marginal at best!! Save Your money for the DVD of the original series! Now I can see why I never saw this film, when it came out!!"
4,For the price..can't beat it!,Great little detector! for the price you can't beat it. I owned the whistler 220 before the 520. I haven't gotten a ticket since I've owned both of them.
2,CD shuffle game,Too many CD's that must be swapped in/out. Also misleading claims about down loading ability to GPS devices etc. I would not recommend this for the serious user.
5,Great Software Great Price,"This is great software. Ive used it my car with laptop and GPS on a variety of road trips MN, TX, LA, UT, MO, AR and gotten myself into and out of many situations without a hitch, except for being towed out of a bayou in Louisiana twice but that was my bad not the softwares. This software will allow you to get to places that others wouldnt be able to find.Ive also used this software to map the entire Salt Lake City Utah region from Ogden all the way to Payson for a telecom company that was using the info for a Wi-Fi positioing service and this NG product was dead on. This job required driving every residential and commercial street in the the Utah metropolitan area and it was flawless, and only off where new developments were being constructed. The onle thing I would add is to install the maps for the region youll be visitng instead of swapping cds in and out so the transition will blend seamlessly.For $49 its tough to beat."
1,Faulty watch band,I bought this watch - loved it - then it broke . It is a bangle type band that opens and closes with hinges where the band meets the watch. this is the part that broke. Anne Klein says they dont warranty that part. and i had huge problems with amazon because it was just past the 60 days to return an item.. they finally did let me exchange it BUT the replacement one did the same thing - and NO ONE will help me. I am out $55 and mad!
5,"So Simple, Yet So Complicated","To take a line from President Gordon B. Hinckley: ""...make good men better and bad men good..."" That is exactly what this book is about: helping people understand how to become better then they were yesterday. So many things in life seem so simple, yet we are so slow to learn. I shudder to think what would come of this world if those who have read this book actually applied the 10 principles more fully in their lives; IT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER! Complacency is far too common. Study these virtues and strive to live them! No one will do it perfectly, but will become all the better through the effort. Why derive new theories for all the world ills when society as a whole is so far from understanding and living principles and ideals which have been in existanced for ages and taught by many different individuals, religiously affiliated and otherwise."
3,"A good book, if not a shade simplistic.","It would be safe to assume that most 5 star reviews for this book come from Mormons, and most 1 star reviews come from anti-Mormons, possibly turning GBH into the unwilling L.Ron Hubbard of Mormonism (see: Battlefield Earth). Oddly enough, several previous reviews seem more concerned with what wasn't included, instead of what is; the book is solidly unassailable in its own right. Who's going to claim we *don't* need any of these virtues?On its own merits, I found this book to be a good summary of basic moral values everyone should brush up on. Nothing new or groundbreaking, just a refresher course. I did find the frequent anecdotes a tad folksy, but overall, the writing is clear and unambiguous.Just a note: Has the person who set list price at $24.00 read the chapter on ""Thrift and Industry""? Is that irony or what?"
5,This is a really good book.,President Hinckley really opened my eyes to a lot of things. This is a must have book for married couples and families.
2,Too much for me,"This book wasn't nearly as helpful as I had hoped. The first half of the book consists of hippy birth stories from the 70s. I know that Ina May Gaskin is a highly respected midwife, so I was hoping for more factual advice. I am also not interested in giving birth at any sort of ""farm"". I was hoping for advice/techniques that would work for a natural hospital birth. If that is what you are looking for as well, I would skip this one."
2,Not really what I was expecting...,"I bought this because the women on the board I frequent stated this is one of THE books to read for pregnant women. Especially those wishing to use as minimal medical intervention as possible.Part one is all birth stories, about 125 pages long. Its interesting to read about it, but it tells NOTHING about HOW these women breathed/relaxed/etc through their stories. The stories are also very old. I would have like to have seen some more recent stories regarding natural childbirth.If you already have some pregnancy books, a LOT of information is already known to you. I usually dogear any page/section I'm interested in going back to, and the only two sections I've dogeared, I have actually read in other books, that give a lot more information as well as more pictures (real life not a diagram or drawing)."
5,best book for birth,"i love love love this book. it's by far my favorite book when explaining the process of birth. women need to be prepared physically, mentally, but also spiritually and i think this book is perfect for all three aspects!"
5,Wow,"This book is amazing. I bought it a few weeks before the birth-center birth of my second child to remind myself about the process. I am so glad I did. I feel empowered, ready, and downright excited.If you are someone (male or female) who is frightened about childbirth, please buy this book. I only wish I'd found it sooner to give to my friends who bought into the ""you have to have an elective epidural/c-section to live through the trial of childbirth"" mindset of their OBGYNs.Ina May Gaskin - YOU ROCK! THANK YOU."
5,Best Childbirth Book I've ever read!,"I've read so many books on this topic it seems between three pregnancies. This by far outdoes all the rest! If you are going the natural way, it explains how our body just does what it needs to do. Birth is normal, and not a medical condition that needs to be treated as a disease. Even If you are going the epidural route, this is a must read. It can help you so much understand what your body is doing through labor. I recommend this to every woman, pregnant or not! My husband even loved it!"
3,"well-written, but I'm not sure it's realistic","I enjoyed reading the book, but it seemed like the author minimized the very real pain of labor and childbirth. I understand her perspective, but it would have been more helpful to hear about practical, real ways to deal with pain during childbirth. I seriously doubt I will have the fabulous birth the author describes simply by changing my perspective and view of birth. I believe most women do experience real pain. I thought the women's stories seemed a bit far-fetched."
5,Awesome!,"This book is so informative. I like how it emphasizes that birthing is a natural process and that it can be viewed as a celebration instead of periods of pains and fears. I'm so glad midwifery is still offered in the US. At one point, seeing and hearing how many pregnant women go straight for C-section instead of birthing naturally, I thought that natural birth was no longer an option. I'm relieved that if I want to, I still have the option of having a baby like my grandma did, in her house, in her room, with her family. Much better experience to look forward too. Thank you Ina May."
5,Ina Mays Guide to Childbirth,"This was an excellent book for anyone, especially first time parents. If you are considering a home birth or just want to be more educated about the birthing process, Ina May is very informative."
4,Ina May's Informative,"This is an informative book for women planning to give natural OR ""assisted"" birth. The real-people stories in the beginning of the book are an added treat. I only wish I knew of a contemporary reference book. This one could be slightly updated."
1,Unrealistic Expectations,"The ""ecstasy"" of childbirth? Having an orgasm as you push your baby into the world? Giving birth on a ""farm"" completely free of medical interventions? These are a few of the ideas this book touts to its readers, while simultaneously discrediting many legitimate obstetric procedures. This book does more to make women feel guilty and inadequate for requiring medical interventions with their births than it does to empower women with tools to use to reach the goal of natural childbirth. Most importantly, it loses sight of the fact that the ultimate goal of childbirth is not to forsake all medication, but rather for both mother and baby to emerge from the experience healthy."
5,Great Information to Empower Woman For a Great Birthing Experience,"Amazing book about the beauty and the capabilities that us as birthing woman have. Great book for informing about the dangers of being in a hospital and having the birthing process taken away from you if are a low risk pregnancy. On the other hand tells so much about how beautiful and wonderful of a process birth can be if you embrace it and let it be the way birth was always meant to be.An easy read, breaking each subject matter down and giving information and evaluating each thing.A book I will always recommend to anyone wanting to get pregnant or newly pregnant to help them evaluate how they want their birthing experience to be."
1,Subzero HID Xenon,"Bad product, after putting it in my car it lasted 2 weeks before they burn out. will never buy this again. I will say buy this if you want to waist you're money."
2,It should state it is plastic lined!,"I bought this thinking it was all stainless steel but it has a plastic lining, YUK. I don't like my coffee in plastic."
2,Very disapointing,"As an avid James Fox fan,I was looking foward to seeing ELGAR'S TENTH MUSE.I was very disappointed with what I saw.James Fox,in the title role,is as always, excellent. And it is very nice and authentic to look at ,too, but the story makes no sense what-some-ever.The ""alleged"" romance between Elgar and violinist, Jelly d'Aranyi as depicted in this movie ,is no more that mild attempt on Elgar's part to get a kiss from the young woman.The scenes are just thrown together,the script not well written and Veteran Btitish charactor actress, Faith Brook, is wasted in the role of Elgar's critically ill wife, as are most of the other cast members.The only things I felt at the end were confusion over what it was all about in the first place and ,relief that the whole thing was over.Only a dedicated James Fox fan,like myself, would see a good reason to get this movie."
5,Hallmark 2007,"love all the new features it has, plus great once it's installed, you don't have to go from cd to cd doing things in this program."
1,Not worth it,"After reading the reviews, I thought it'd be a good way to entertain my cat, who enjoys watching animal shows on TV. The quality of the video is not good, however, and more importantly, my cat did not want to watch it at all, even though I held her pointing at it several times. Bottom line is that I think it's a great concept and apparently some cats may like it, but mine did not."
2,reprint,"The book I got said 1967 but was a 1977 reprint and was only fair condition not good. I loved the book when I was a child. I have not got my little one to love it, oh well."
3,Does What It's Supposed To Do,"The Timex T617S works as advertised. You can play an MP3 player such an iPod through it. That's great and what I was looking for. It has a dual alarm. It has presets for the radio (AM and FM). Those are great. What I don't like about the unit is there's no way to completely turn off the clock display lighting. You can adjust the lighting to one of three intensity levels but with the lowest, even in the dark my entire bedroom is lit up. I end up covering the unit with shirt at night. Worse yet, if you want to listen to the unit in the dark, there's even more and brighter light that comes from the CD area, even if you're not listening to the CD. I don't see why these manufacturers don't understand that many people want lights off in their bedroom at night. The nature sounds are rather cheesy. Overall, I'd rate this unit 3 out of 5 stars at best."
1,Only One Flaw ... But It's A Biggie,"I loved every feature of this CD/clock radio: the design, the easily programmable functions, and the several options for audio (Radio, CD, MP3).But Timex totally went cheap on the speakers. They are simply awful. There's no bass output and the mid-high ranges warble so badly you wonder if the speakers are loose or cracked. The unit does sound great with headphones or stand-alone powered speakers, but who wants to wear headphones to bed? What's the point of buying $100 speakers for my $60 alarm clock?One other small irritant. The volume is weak. I'm getting a little irritated with audio products that produce imperceptible volume until you dial it up past level 4. I mean, it's not my stereo but level 1 - 3 of volume should be level 1 - 3 ... not level 0. Wouldn't you agree?"
1,Hunk of Junk,"Bought this for my mother. While it worked the controls were difficult to use. Bought this in Fall 2006, the CD player stopped playing about six months later. Don't buy this product."
1,Avoid it like the plague!,"I should have listened to the gazillions of other disgruntled customers, but it was the only product that had the combination of features I wanted. What a HUGE waste of money!!!The thing didn't work from the beginning. One speaker constantly cut out, but I had decided just to live with it. But within a month the so-called ""Smart Knob"" quit working entirely. Now the thing is useless - can't set the alarms, can't change the volume (permanently set at an inaudible ""1""). What's the point? Can't use it as an alarm clock, can't use it as a stereo.It's going in the garbage!Do as I say and not as I did. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,A Promising Unit But Did Not Last,"We really liked the features and this alarm/player worked well for a few months, but just barely out past the 3 month warranty the CD player failed, which means since we wanted a CD alarm, the unit is now junk. Well placed buttons and nice dual alarm and display, but unless the manufacturer can offer a full year warranty (or more, why not), get something else."
2,Product has many features but very poor audio quality,"This clock/music player functions, however for the price, the audio quality is very poor for both lower and higher frequencies. In these ranges, the audio breaks up or rumbles. Only mid-range frequencies sound OK.When playing a CD, a blue light shines from the player. This light is bright enough to be a night-light, which a person may or may not appreciate.I have stopped using this item due to the poor audio quality. I would not recommend it to a friend."
2,Junk,"I tried to set the alarm, and realized I had to press the alarm 1 button over and over to get it to work, the reverse track button wouldn't function unless you braced the unit with two hands and pushed really hard, and the first CD I played skipped repeatedly, (this CD has never had a problem playing on other units). Don't buy it. Timex is throwing away whatever brand equity they have left marketing this junk."
3,"Display too bright, poor radio reception","I suppose this is not a bad multi-tasker, if you're looking for a mini stereo in the bedroom. However, as a bedside radio/ alarm, it is seriously lacking. Even the dimmest setting of the display lights up the room like it's Vegas, and there is also a blue light in the CD window that is lit whenever the radio or CD players is on--not ideal for falling asleep to background noise. Radio reception is mediocre: like another reviewer, I can't get NPR (which is actually at the higher end of the FM dial here) even with antenna boosters. Also, the ""wake to CD"" feature is not all it's cracked up to be. It can only start at track 1, and every time you press snooze, the CD starts over at the beginning. Overall, it is definitely not worth it's rather high price tag."
3,Flawed but functional,"I've had this alarm clock for over a year. It's functional, but flimsy. Lately the buttons on the top to set the 2 alarms frequently turn the nap timer on instead. And the button to turn the alarms on and off will change the brightness setting of the display. It's just not built well. Then there's the option to wake to any CD you want. That's what I was really looking forward to. The flaw is that it only plays the first track of the CD. You would think it would pick a track at random. I ended up burning a bunch of CDs with one track only so the clock would use the songs I wanted for the alarm, but that's a limited work around. I'm currently looking to replace this clock"
5,Simple yet very effective,"I got some of these when visiting Denmark several years ago and brought back enough to give as small gifts to several friends. (And a few for ourselves, of course.) Everyone comments on how well they work and how clever the design is. I have several other wine pourers but they tend to be more work to clean and store while not being any more effective, so our Drop Stops are the only wine pourers we ever use. I'm excited to see that they're available through Amazon, because now when people ask me where I got mine I can refer them here!"
3,Not as good as Artemis Fowl.,Fletcher Moon treasures the badge that he earned in an online private detective course. April Devereux hires him to find an item stolen by one of the Sharkeys (who are all criminals) and things soon turn out to not be what they seemed. His badge is stolen and he's arrested for arson after April's playhouse burns down. Fletcher finds himself in a heap of trouble and the only person willing to help him is Red Sharkey.
4,Half Moon Investigations Eoin Colfer,This was a very good story. Great for kids and adults alike. However I do have to admit that I still like Artemis Fowl better.
5,Great item!,"This lamp socket is exactly what I was looking for. Great low price, good description, and arrived 5 days earlier than expected. I used it in a custom lamp I built for my mother-in-law. Works perfectly, brand new.Switch positions are as follows:1. All Off2. Secondary Circuit Only3. Primary Socket Only4. Both On"
3,"Great sound, difficulty securing to wall","For the price, the speakers sound really nice - great dynamic range for the size, and the directional tweeter is a nice touch. I'm using them as rear speakers in a five-speaker + subwoofer home theater set. Here's the problem: They anchor to the drywall with screws in front that pull the ""feet"" in the back tightly in against the inside of the wall. On both speakers, I was only able to get 3 out of the 6 screws to turn. No amount of torque would get them to turn and I gave up for fear of snapping off the piece or stripping the screwhead."
4,Samuel L. Jackson is Simply FANTASTIC,"This was one of the movies that I wasn't able to see when I was at Sundance 2001. If you like Samuel L. Jackson, you really have to see Caveman's Valentine. He's just exceptional as a homeless man who grapples with his sanity while tracking down a murderer. The movie works on so many levels and Samuel L. Jackson really draws you in. The DTS audio track sounded fantastic and was just perfect in the scenes where Jackson's character plays piano. The music in the film Caveman's Valentine is a real treat and you get a lot of insight into the whole piece in the Director's Commentary. I'm really glad I finally got to see Caveman's Valentine - it was well worth the wait! [Geoffrey Kleinman DVDTalk.com]"
5,Caveman's Valentine,"Previously, I viewed this movie on cable and thought it was brilliant. There was nothing else to do but to order a copy for my video library."
4,I Love It! No leaks here.,"I was worried after purchasing this carafe and reading the previous review. It looks cool and I tried pouring water from this carafe every which way to make it leak, but it works just fine. I really am glad I made this purchase."
1,Useless blather?,"I read 2 chapters of this silly book, thinking it might contain something about black holes. Maybe there is something about black holes later, but I got turned off real quick by the silly, useless, confusing, pointless, and whatever other adjective I can come up with to descibe the material in the first chapter. The first chapter almost made me stop there, but I thought that I would read at least one more..yuckNot recommended"
5,Get ready for a roller coaster ride!,"This book is full of more suprises than you can count! The third book of ""Abram's daughters"" is yet another well researched, well written book. The great tragedy they refer to in the synopsis is actually the second great tragedy to occur within it's pages, and both are so heart-wrenching it's advisable to keep a box of tissues nearby. I finished it in about 18 hours, and that includes a good nights sleep in there. I just couldn't wait to find out what happens next!I wonder which sacrifice the title refers to--it could be argued between two of them, one stemming from each tragedy mentioned before. I don't want to give away the plot, it is well worth reading, and far too good to be summed up in a few sentances.I am waiting on the edge of my seat for #4 The Prodigal to come out in October. Even its very title fills me with hope for a happy ending at long last for our ""ever faithful Leah."""
5,wonderful,this story from the begining to what i hav e read so far has been a wonderful read. i bought book 4-5 and cant wait to get them in the mail.
4,Panasonic Shaver and ear and nose trimmer,Overall great products. The shaver could provide a bit more closer shave for beard stubble. The ear and nose trimmer does the job well.
1,this is not for me!,"I dislike the smell of this product so immensely that it is going right back to Amazon. It has a very unfamiliar fragrence which I could still smell the next day even despite the fact that I had thoroughly washed my face the night before. It also feels very slippery like baby oil and not like tha hylauronic acid products I have ever used before. I had signed up for this product to be delivered every 3 months, but I can't stand it for even 3 minutes!"
1,Very poor product,"This is a cheap poorly designed product that I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with. The hardware isn't appropriately sized for the fastening it is supposed to do and when fully assembled the stand does not stand flat on the ground. As soon as I opened the box, I realized I had made a mistake buying this product."
2,Not very sturdy and not ready for assembly,"Packaging was ok. Would be very easy to assemble except all the holes were not there, had to drill my own. After assembled, it was not very sturdy, not a very good wood rack at all!"
1,Not worth the time,"I bought this book because it was ranked ""alongside the likes of Asimov and Heinlein."" I should have known better, I know. Not only do I concur with other reviewers about the weakness of plot and lack of any real action, but it is written very poorly. After the third confusing passage where we start in the present, progress to a past/future flashback, and then end up back in the future present...I gave up. The use of this writing tool in the book makes it completely confusing and unreadable. I hated it, put it down for the day, cussing the entire time, and later burned in my fireplace for kindling. It was useful for something, though a bit pricey compared to other forms of kindling."
3,A FUN BUT SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS STORY,"In a future where corporations effectively rule mankind CC Williams, a midlevel auditor, is sent out to the asteroid belt to check up on some suspected hanky-panky with the books. In a corporate world where even the damning with faint praise on a evaluation can result in not only unemployment but death CC has to keep her bosses as well as the clients happy all while someone is trying to kill her.For the most part an average bit of fluff but at least the universe Ms. Shwartz creates is interesting and the story line fun. Unfortunately it is also pretty obvious from the first couple of pages what the outcome for at least part of the storyline will be.The characters are fairly well developed and enjoyable to follow but the buzz-speak of the corporate cultural is overdone and distracting.All in all a fair result but I'm going to remain NEUTRAL on this one. It just didn't do much for me."
5,great improvement,"Bring Me The Horizon's Count Your Blessings is a major improvement from their previously released EP This Is What The Edge Of Your Seat Was Made For. Some of the songs on CYB had been previously recorded live and in rough demos. The two instrumental tracks, Slow Dance and 15 Fathoms, Counting [which is also acoustic], are executed amazingly and show that BMTH aren't just five little teenagers with an electric guitar, but are also talented in the non-'br00tal' genre. I don't have any favorite tracks, because all of them are different in their own way and are all excellent."
3,"Good at first, but about 150 pages too long","The premise was fascinating - who hasn't thought at least one time in their life their parents are not really their parents, and that they were adopted? This book grabbed me from the start, and carried me through the first hundred or so pages at breakneck speed. In the middle I kind of lost steam, and by the end of the book, I was almost screaming, ""When is this going to be over?!?!?"" The last hundred pages or so dragged, and I almost didn't care if anyone made it to the end. Overall, it was a decent book, and I wouldn't mind trying out another one by Zachary Fox, I just hope he gets a better editor."
2,Good story that was poorly written & hard to believe.,"Good story that was poorly written. Story moves very fast with a lot of redundancy. Relationships are made over a period of days that take a normal human years to achieve. The word ""fiction"" sums this book up. It could never happen the way the author dreamed it up."
4,cool t shirts,"got them right on time, the t shirts are thick enough to be worn by itself, the color is very solid, went just right on the size (medium, im 5'9 175 pounds)"
2,Calvin Klein V-Neck Sizing,"I purchased these T-shirts for my husband who is 5'10"" and weighs 175. I bought a ""Medium"" based on the reviews about sizing which stated that they ran large. These were the right size when I took them out of the package, but shrunk in width so much that my husband couldn't get them over his head. I wouldn't buy these again because it would be impossible to choose the right size since they only shrunk in width not length."
3,Heart Rate Book,Mediocre book. There are better and more modern (newer thoughts and science) texts out there.
5,good buy..good product,This gadget has already paid for itself by renovation some DVDs so they can be reused.
2,Cheap!,"How cheap! They don't even include the little buffing square and polishing cloth. As others say, this is nothing special. Just distilled water and alcohol. I was under the impression that it was something special. It's not. Especially considering you don't get new cloths."
3,"Adequate, but not the best choice","I used the Skip Dr. products for a couple of years. They do an adequate job for the average user. However, for professional use, (i.e., those who use it more than a few times a year), there are much better products. I'm currently using the JFJ Easy Pro Repair System, also available on Amazon. It does a FAR superior job to the Digital Innovations products and is no more complicated to use (but it is a bit more expensive)."
1,Quantum Poor equipment service and terrible Customer service,I purchased a very expensive Quantum Elliptical machine. When I needed service for a problem they charged me one hundred dollars before even sending anyone to my house to look at it. The technician was there no more than ten minutes and said he could not get the equipment to malfunction. How hard could he have tried if he was only there ten minutes? He left and the problem grew worse and worse until finally I could no longer use the machine at all. I called back. You guessed it. They are charging me ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS again just to send the same guy out to look at it a second time. As far as I am concerned they know they have you over a barrel and they don't care one damn bit about your business or about customer service. Buying exercise equipment? Go someplace other than Quantum.
4,Investments for Today,Great book for people who like to know why the Stock Markets movein various manners!!!
4,damn good entertainment,"saw this when it came out in tribeca, have remembered and looked for it since, excellent"
5,Please release on DVD!!!,"I love this heartwarming, gentle story, but have watched my VHS version so many times that it is worn out. I would love to get it on DVD. Please release again for those of us who love it."
4,Poor Sound,"As usual Graham Greene is very likeable and does a fine job. The story is interesting and entertaining. However, the audio and music tracks are horrible. Nothing like a distorted audio to make you quessy and take away from one's enjoyment."
1,Major disappointment,"If you are buying this book to stare are Ty then purchase it, but if you want actual carpentry tricks or repair advice look elsewhere. There is nothing in this book that could not be learned within a ONE minute conversation with your local home repair center. Truthfully, most of his advice is nothing more than common sense. Only someone that has NEVER done a repair for themselves would find value in this book."
2,Making money today from yesterday,"I am looking for Ty's magazine...TODAY'S thoughts, TODAY's information.This was too dated for my interests."
1,Dont get tricked into buying this,"I love Ty Pennington, this book was a waste of money, there were a couple of good tips, nothing i couldnt find flipping through a magazine, most of the projects werent feasible for me to do (they might appeal to someone else) most of this book was really to take pictures of Ty in various poses."
4,A great collection of great stories from a great author,"The stories in this book are some of the best of Heinlein's short stories. I found this book in my dad's study, and read it on a whim. It hooked me to Heinlein, and I immediately read _Past Through Tomorrow_ and then _Puppet Masters_. If you are looking for a good Heinlein collection, here it is."
2,"Beautiful, but will not last!","I've had two of these feeders in copper, and neither of them lasted for more than a year! The fault is in the construction of the metal feeding/perching plate. It is simply bolted into the plastic tube, which is too weak to withstand the weight of the plate. So after being knocked down a time or two, whether by wind or the occasional squirrel, the plastic cracks under pressure and the entire bottom of the feeder breaks off with no way to be repaired."
5,A Creative Christian Comedy,"Yes, it's corny at times, but if you do corny just right, you can not only get away with it, but it can be great entertainment! Most comedies end up trying to be funny by getting as close to the border of offensive as possible. It is SOOOO refreshing to find something that makes you laugh that you also don't feel like trashing in the next scene. The story starts out a bit weird and corny and develops into a humorous, dramatic, heartwarming tale of what real meaning in life is about. It is unique in it's genre, in a world full of too many rapture, end-days Christian movies or the alternate end of the road, then get saved variety. Yet, at the same time, it effectively assaults the shallow thinking of today's society with looking beyond the veil. Try the movie, make sure you get past the 1st 10 minutes and I think you'll love it."
4,ESL teacher's book of instant word games,I found this book to be very useful as a supplementary tool.The games are fun and engaging. I used the games as competition quiz games.The students found them very entertaining and resourceful.
5,Great Replacement,"My cooking frequently requires a food processor. When I cracked part of the side lock I knew one day it would give out. I ordered the replacement bowl on Amazon, so when I'm in the middle of preparation, I won't get caught with a half done preparation. No worries."
1,My recent purchases,"I was disappointed in all of the books that I ordered recently. They were all too thin and were not complete. I expected them to have more than just worksheet type info. The 2 games I purchased were satisfactory, but the candy was unexpected - I thought it was a game as well."
3,wii straps,I was hoping it was the newer version of the wii strap with the lock. It is not. It is the old version where the strap slides. FYI
1,aweful radio,This clock radio has a wheel to locate stations and the reception is horrible. Mine is going back directly to whence it came. It seems radios these days have worse and worse reception. Can you get a good radio anymore?
1,ZERO stars,"I purchased this in July and the CD player quit working in November. The unit is too large. There is no way for the sleep mode to run at a different volume than the alarm mode. The ""digital tuner"" is run by a wheel instead of a button so it is no more precise than an analog tuner. What a waste of money....."
1,CD player didn't work,"The CD player gave us problems out of the box. It often wouldn't recognize that a CD was in the machine. (We should have returned it, but I'd just had a baby so no time.) After a few months, the CD player stopped working entirely."
3,"Some Drawbacks, But Does The Job","Received this as a gift. I agree that it is overly large for your average nightstand and the display is incredibly bright, even on its dimmest setting. As with most clock radios sporting ""nature sounds"", these tend to be repetitive and distorted to the point that they don't sound ""natural"" at all. The exception are the wind chimes, which are actually very pleasant to wake up to. On the plus side, you have a variety of alarm modes (CD, radio, nature sounds), two separate alarms, sleep timer, and an aux input for an MP3 player, all of which have worked just fine for me. Bottom line: it does what I need it to do."
4,Pretty Good,"Overall I would rate this product as pretty good. I purchased it to go w/ an inflatable kayak. It works well and quickly to blow up the kayak. I only gave it 4 stars because you need to be carefull when blowing up the kayak b/c the pump attachments can pop off if you are not paying attention, and the kayak will deflate. Now that I know it is a possible problem, I always watch out for it, and don't have problems."
4,ThreeLac Probiotic,"I am very happy with this product. It has helped my digestive system that I've had issues with for years. The only issue I have with it, is that they are costly. I haven't tried other products because when I find something that works I usually stay with it. Just wish it wasn't so expensive."
3,Somewhat of a disappointment,"Following the success of the New Basics and her other books with Julie Rosso, I was frankly disappointed by this book. Many of the recipes are pretty anemic, watered down versions of the real McCoys. I would have liked to see more intense spices and flavors, and less ""Americanized"" versions of what should have been intriguing international cuisine. I expected more from Sheila Luckens."
4,Basic Black Frame,"I installed this on the front of my black Prius. It looks fine.It is made of plastic, and will probably crack if it ever gets hit, but for what it cost that's to be expected."
2,crushed package inside amazon's packaging,the item was received crushed inside amazon's package. the disc is o.k. but the box that it was in is crushed and in a used appearance. after filing a claim with amazon was told item was no longer available.
4,An amazing athlete who deserves a legacy,"I couldn't stop myself for reviewing this book when I was searching around on Amazon. Bo Jackson was my favorite athlete along with Michael Jordan growing up and I was so obsessed with him that I name my cat Bo (my mother wouldn't go for ""air"" after Michael Jordan). The book, although interesting in that it chronicles his life and many trials and tribulations, is perhaps most special because of how good of athlete Bo Jackson was and how quick his career ended later. He is without a doubt one of the best athletes of all time and an all star in both baseball and football. He was truly a special talent who if he had not been plagued by injury might have shattered all kinds of records in both leagues. There has not been an athlete like him in the last 20 years so we can only hope another talent like him will come along."
2,Disappointing...,"After purchasing my Nespresso machine I enjoyed churning out Gingerbread lattes from an online recipe. My daughter requested a turtle latte and I decided a few fun espresso recipes would be great!So I went in search of the perfect coffee drinks book. Sadly, this was not it. This was very disappointing. The espresso section was a few brief pages AND did not really include any speciality recipes.Not a good choice for good coffee drinks."
3,Good book for at home coffee treats,"This is a relativly simple book for those who want to impress their friends with a tasty coffee. However if you are a true espresso fan you may be dissapointed, I find the book has more of a candy appeal than true coffee expressions."
3,Magistrate miraculously regains sight,"I was moderately diverted by the plot, despite increasingly silly heroine, until the courthouse scene presided over by magistrate Sir John Fielding (younger brother of Tom Jones author Henry Fielding). John Fielding was blind (either since birth or an accident at age 19) and could not have ""surveyed the women with a steady reproving stare"", nor ""regard the two complainants"" nor ""rest.. his gaze..."". Neither could he have later accurately described the heroine's red hair and green eyes.While it is always interesting to find real historical personages peopling a novel, the author is obliged to get the facts right. It would be like writing a biography of Van Gogh & forgetting the part about his ear. In the end it is all the reader notices."
3,"Yes, a good starter juicer","I agree that this is a great starter juicer. You do get more juice if you put the pulp through another time or two, as it doesn't always get everything the first time. I gave it three stars for this and that you get a lot less pulp with more expensive juicers. It's easy to take apart and clean (with a bottle brush). There are about 5 parts that need washing."
4,15 years and still going,I bought this juicer at Target in 1997 and it is still going strong. I use it at least once a week. Never had any problems with anything I juiced. The opening is a little small causing you to have to cut the fruits and veggies thin. Any other color then white would have been good as carrots tend to be a pain to get off of it. All in all this thing has never failed me.
2,Black and Decker JM300,"This machine is complete waste of plastic and some metal. It gets clogged, and it just does not do a good job with juicing. When I pressed a little harder, the motor started to burn, very weak machine. 2 stars, since it does juice, but lots and lots of waste."
3,Better than nothing,"I have both the Memorex OptiFix Pro and the DR. CD & DVD repair devices and of the two, I'd have to say the DR. is the better machine. However, neither one offers much help for badly scratched discs. If you take care of your discs and handle them gently, the DR. repair device is good to have on hand for quick repairs of minor scratches that may occur when a CD or DVD is accidently dropped or scuffed, but it likely won't help much on discs that have been repeatedly mishandled, such as rental discs or discs from the public library. The DR. is definitely not the panacea for scratched discs that it's advertised to be. Still, it's better than nothing and may just save you the cost of replacing lightly scratched CDs and DVDs from time to time, and that makes it worth having. Until I find something better, I'll continue buying these replacement wheels for my DR."
4,Gets the job done,"The replacement wheels are the same as the wheel that ships with the cd/dvd polisher. Works great. Deep scratches take a lot of time, and keeping the disk wet during polishing requires constant attention. But in the end, it will save your disks. Of course there are scratches that are just too deep for this type of polisher, but with persistence, you can usually save the data on very messed-up discs - the kind you find under the car seat without a case. If you have a lot of messed-up discs, be ready to commit a good amount of time to your project."
1,mine broke and I cant get support,"Cant recommend this product, broke after a month, cannot get support"
3,Non-Electric Life Experiment,"This book wasn't what I thought it would be. It's very interesting, but it's more about the emotional aspect of living off the grid, than the entire experience. I honestly think it would have been a better read if it had been in a 'journal' format or had given more specifics about The Life.He speaks in generalities, and doesn't say diddly about his wife, which I find interesting in a not so kind way. LOL"
4,Fun read.,"I found this book to be rather interesting. It is the story of a young man and young woman, who decide to live an alternative lifestyle for a while in a patchwork community of like-minded invdividuals ranging from Amish to those who just got fed up with technology. The stories of their trials and tribulations are entertaining... did I mention the young man is Eric, and the young woman, is a woman who is still with him to this day?-Ryan Mercer."
5,Fantastic!,"This is yet another amazing addition to Jim Jenner's already vast collection of secrets for the fancier. Just when you think there can't be anymore secrets left, another movie comes out absolutely filled with great information! Not too give anything away, but the information about the eye will blow you away!"
1,Painful reading,"I was so excited when I purchased this at our local Goodwill, for only $1.99! I thought I was getting the deal of a lifetime. Boy was I wrong, they should have been handing out this book for free. I was interested for the first 200 pages, but after that every one of the girls were so horrific I could only hope they would get what was coming to them. I have around 100 pages left and I am not even sure if I can continue to read. Janey is an outrageous skank with zero morals or ethics. It isn't a fun, sexy book like Sex and the City, or even 4 Blondes. I'm getting bored with all the low class behavior and general lack of plot. I would give this zero stars if I could, and I haven't even finished. Don't bother ladies."
1,Devastatingly Horrible,"This book is by far the worst thing I have ever read in my life. I always finish a book even if it's not so good, but I couldn't even force myself to finish this one. It is so boring and poorly written that it's not even funny. I don't think there was one character in this book that I actually liked, not one of them had any redeeming qualities about themselves. I had high hopes since I enjoyed 4 Blondes, but Trading Up fell flat. If I could have given it negative stars, I would have."
1,Throwing Up,"I am terribly sorry, but the new trend of nine cent novels by vapid celebrities is enough to make one queasy.Comparisons of Bushnell to Wharton and Austin are at best ludicrous and at worst, totally insane.Spend your money on bobby pins, they are more substantial and interesting."
4,Good Read for the Superficial,If you like Sex and the City and Superficial non-sense then I suggest this book. I like to read about other people's lives true or not. This is a rollercoaster story and easy read. Overall - good book!
1,A boring book about shallow people,"What a disappointment this book was. Granted, I had not read a Bushnell book and my only knowledge of her is the very wonderful Sex and the City on HBO, but I do know books and this was like a glossy depiction of shallow people in an unbelievable social setting. I finished the book only out of curiosity to see how she would wind things up, and ended up thinking, Who Cares? I'd never want to get to know these people and couldn't care less about what happened to them. It read like a corny nighttime soap on Lifetime. I'm not impressed with Bushnell's writing at all and cannot recommend this book."
2,"Oh, good grief","Trading up? Uh-uh. Trading on her fame, that's what Candace Bushnell has done. And it's definitely a letdown, after Sex and the City. The whole schtick centers around some model named Janey Wilcox, and you know what? By the end, I just didn't care a whit what happens to her.Fergeddit, IMO."
1,BORING & HOPELSS ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I would not recommend this book to anyone.. it is such a pathetic waste of time and I cannot believe that books like this get released. I kept reading hoping it would get better and finally gave up.. Bushnell has no talent for story telling and what she does is use her obviuos knowledge of the NY social scene and keeps repeating herself to fill up 400 + pages of boredom
5,All I want for Christmas...,"Is a sequal for this book!!! Ms. Bushnell once again has a way of wrapping me up into this life that I wish I could be a part of! I was upset when I finished the book as it ended my little stint of feeling like an insider in the New York social scene. Janey's character is so much fun to read - you love her, you hate her, you love to hate her, you hate to love her. The book leaves you wanting more - which is always ALWAYS a good/bad thing. I really hope that there is a follow up to this - as Janey's character is too much fun to let go!This book is an excellent summer read - especially for anyone fascinated with the New York social scene."
3,Leaves room for more...,"Although the story was far from boring, it left way too much open and didn't flow smoothly. he main character is trashy, has no morals, values or well.....anything! What an awful main character...even for a money and power hungry New York Party Girl.I wouldn't run to my friends and recommend this book but I wouldn't tell them not to read it."
3,Like watching a train wreck,"... or a car crash. You are driving by and want to avert your eyes and focus on the road but you just can't .... this protagonist is not a nice person, in fact I don't think ANYONE in the book was nice and you didn't even care what good or bad things happen - the only good thing about it was the kind of ""insider gossip"" info ...."
2,Wish I hadn't happened upon this book,I read to page 170 and just decided to quit. The characters were basically shallow and unlikable. Maybe the book improves if one reads on but I have had enough.
2,"Dreadful, vacuous characters and a waste of time.","You keep hoping Janey will have some redeeming qualities or will have an epiphany around her self-centered life.. but she doesn't. The book is entirely frustrating, irritating and unsatisfying, although it does provide a probably fairly accurate glimpse into the inner workings of New York City ""society""."
1,Nothing Short of Dreadful,"This book is so bad, I am ashamed to say I finished it. In fact, it is one of the worst books I have ever read. Janey Wilcox is shallow, unlikeable and completely self centered. I work and live around people like that, so why would I consider it entertainment to read about them? Don't read this one; it's a waste of time."
3,Good escapist fun,"Suffice it to say that this book is no ""Sex and the City,"" but it is 10,000 times better than ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Bushnell creates well-developed characters and an interesting plot; it just seems to take too long to work through it.You may not like the main character Janie but you can laugh at her, shake your head at her and think of at least one person that you have met who she reminds you of in some way. She's one of those self-involved, self-destructive people who seems oblivious to the havoc she leaves in her wake. Bushnells' characterizations of the people around Janie and their efforts to deal with the impact of her behavior are a large part of what keeps this book interesting and entertaining.This isn't a literary masterpiece but if you need an escapist break, this book will fill the bill."
1,"More like ""Trading down""","This book was stupid, to say the least. Raunchy, filthy, not to mention pointless. It was equally as retarted as ""Sex and the City""(The name tells all). Janey Wilcox is the junkiest, most irritating character in any book that I have ever read. I couldn't even finish it because I was so disgusted. To wrap it up(like a bean burrito) it stinks(like rotten cheese), and I reccomend never reading it."
3,The fundamental problem...,"The fundamental problem with this book is the main character, Janey. Yes, there are real people like her (and yes, I'm thinking of Paris Hilton) but would you really want to read their biography? It takes a very talented writer to take a basically unsympathetic character and make her sympathetic, but Candace Bushnell is not that writer. Janey has been compared to Scarlett O'Hara and Becky Sharp, but while she is as manipulative and ruthless as they are, she does not have their charm or their vulnerability, which makes these characters intriguing and yes, even likable, despite their shenanigans. Janey is one-dimensional and boring, and although the book is entertaining enough, it could have been so much better."
1,Boring,"I usually love books like this, but this was so hard to get into and totally boring. To be honest, I didn't even read it all because it was so torturous that watching paint dry or grass grow seemed like a more preferable option. Sex and The City was a fantastic series (didn't miss 1 single episode) but she can't expect her fans to keep appreciating her work when it's rubbish like this. Sorry Candace. Please go back to good stuff like SITC."
2,Bushnell can do better,"Trading up is about a woman named Janey Wilcox , she does everything in her power to become rich and famous. Even things that include hurting the people she loves. I think this is one of Candace Bushnell's worst books. First of all the book is too long for this kind of story. Some chapters are too long and I got easily bored.I see Janey as a modern time hooker. I got disgusted by the things she did. But still, somehow I can understand why she did it. Fame is everything to her, the thing she's wanted sense she was a teen. She does all these things she hates just to get those 15 minutes of fame, which she plans will last for eternity./Jelena Batista"
3,Not as steamy as I thought it would be....,"...not that there's anything wrong with that, but sex was mostly eluded to. This is the first Candace Bushnell book that I've read. I bought it to read on the beach in Cabo and it was a good choice. She's a pretty good writer and the characters are fun. I found myself really disliking the main character which made for a compelling read. If you want to feel better about the fact that you're NOT rich and beautiful and famous then read this book. If there's a sequel I'll read it."
1,The most annoying protaganist ever,"Halfway into the book, I completely lost interest in what happened to Janey Wilcox. It is not giving anything away to say that this character does not grow or change as a result of the events of the book, and is the most self absorbed human being on the planet. (Most of the other characters are equally repugnant.) I, too, am disappointed that I spend the money on the hardback edition."
4,Revisiting Tragedy,"Exactly 7 days after PanAm flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, I was on PanAm flight 103 from Frankfurt through London and on to New York. Now, some 15 years later, I stumbled upon this book and, out of morbid curiosity, read it. I was impressed with the thoroughness of the research and informal writing style adopted to tell this story. My only complaint is that the information is dated. Since its printing in 1990, more information has been collected as a result of the continued investigation. Lybia and Qaddafi were the ultimate bad guys here. There was also the successful law suit presented by the survivors of the victims of the disaster. I would suggest that Emerson and Duffy write a ""sequel."""
4,Another Solid BFI Offering,"A ""Modern Classic"" indeed, Heat definitely deserves a whole book, and Nick James does a good job of chugging through its nearly three hours of plot while still being insightful.I would have loved some more shot-by-shot breakdowns of scenes because of Mann's craftmanship with the lens, but James is more concerned with the angst of the single-minded male protagonists. James also continues an odd trend I have noticed in modern film books of quoting movie dialogue incorrectly.By the way, Heat looks awesome on Blu-ray!Heat [Blu-ray]"
1,a worthless book,This is a worthless book that provides no credible information. It is very poorly written. One should not waste time reading it.
5,An essential reading for every lebanese worldwide,We are greatful for Robert Maroun Hatem to have written such an impressive piece. This is an exposition that will trigger a sense of nationalism in every true believer in Lebanon. This is the first time that an insider has disclosed the disturbing extent to which the lebanese civil war has driven lebanese militia leaders and many others to kill one another in pursuit of power forgeting that we were all trying to save the lebanese dream...10452 km2.
2,Nostalgic use only,"Looking at this show with adult eyes, i see hideous animation i used to think was cool when i was a kid. Nonetheless, this was a nice trip back to yesteryear and to the return of the greatest autobot leader of all ( yeah, you heard me, rodimus )."
5,THIS IS A MUST READ!,"I must admit the book starts out a little slow, but by the 2nd chapter I was hooked. The things that Rufus was able to get away with just made my jaw drop."
5,"My Goodness, What a Father/Husband From Hell","Lawd, Lawd, Lawd...This book has a family that created dysfunction. My goodness...If you want a book that will capture you from start to finish, this is the book. The head of the house hold, the provider, the protector, is absolutely insane. A MUST READ!"
4,Great slide hammer for occasional use,"Pros:Low cost slide hammer with almost every attachment you can think of. Case keeps it all organized.Cons: Comes with only one thread set for pulling threaded holes (pull dowels). Others can easily be added by purchasing bolts and washers of appropriate size from your hardware store. Professional pullers often have a coupler slot for the threaded pullers. You must remove a nut cap to install the bolt. Not terribly convenient.Conclusions: For occasional use, it is great and I'm glad I bought it. If I were using it every day, I'd get a high priced set."
5,Love his music,will enjoy listening to this and others of his I ordered was nice to be able to listen to samples before ordering
2,shuffleboard dust,It doesn't work on our shuffleboard table the puck stops in about the middle of the table so I am sending it back for a refund.
3,Just Acceptable,"Acceptable Risk is pretty much like all of Robin Cook's other novels. The plot is interesting, but the writing is poor. I thought the dialogue in this novel was especially trite. A good, quick read for a trip, but if you're into literature, this is one you can skip."
3,"A fast read, but slightly implausible.","Robin Cook explores the dangers of drugs used to change human personalities. Interwoven in this cautionary tale is a young woman's research into her ancestor's role in the Salem witch trials 300 years earlier.I thoroughly enjoyed the information about the Salem witch trials, and information about the possible cause being contaminated rye. The heroine's search for her ancestor's involvement in this horrible event, and the unimpeachable evidence used to convict her were fascinating reading.The part of the story dealing with the development of a new psychtropic drug and testing on human subjects was not as engrossing for me. I especially found the final result of the people taking the untested drug to be rather unbelievable.Robin Cook certainly knows how to craft a medical thriller, and keep his readers turning pages to find out what happens next. This book continues that tradition, but it is made just a little too implausible in this story."
3,great mix of past and present,"This is my favorite Robin Cook novel, mainly for the blending of science and history. Starting in the 1690s, with a twist on the cause of the Salem With Trials, it moves into the present with a comparable story of scientists exploring a supposedly 'perfect' drug that could eliminate depression. Cook raises a great issue with the idea of a 'happy pill' that negates the idea of personal self-examination -- just take the pill, and all your problems are solved. Of course, being a thriller, that doesn't happen. I found the characters to be more sympathetic and real than in some of Cook's other work. I also liked the historical research of Kim into her ancestor Elizabeth's trial and execution in the 1690s, and Kim's discovery of the irrefutable 'evidence' of witchcraft used to convict Elizabeth. I also enjoyed the suspense and the moral component at the end."
4,Great Book,"When I started reading this book, I was a little dissapointed with the conversations (they seemed too made up) but the matter was too rivetting for me to put the book down . and I'm glad that I did not stop, cause the ending was superb. And I was scared to death. after my roomate had read it, we would wake up in the middle of the night and look at each other's bed, just in case. Very exciting read."
2,Filled with mistakes...,"This was one of the worst Robin Cook books that I had the displeasure of reading.Elizabeth Mills was supposedly hanged as a witch in the 1600s. Flash to modern times and we read how Kim Stewart and Edward Armstrong discover the coffin:Edward shined the light into the open end of the coffin. ""We're in luck,"" he said. ""The corpse has been mummified by the cold and the dryness. Even the winding sheet is intact.""""I think we've done enough."" Elizabeth said. But she might as well have been talking to the wind. Edward wasn't listening. To her horror she watched while he put the light down and reached into the coffin. ""Edward! What are you doing?""The book is filled with several instances where the author confuses his characters, and has Elizabeth (who is dead) speaking when he obviously meant for Kim to be speaking...These mistakes take away from the enjoyment of the book, as one begins to become very conscious of all of the author's errors..."
3,Interesting but too bombastic,"I read the book with a group of ministers as our quarterly selection. We felt we learned about a fascinating period of history and Augustine as a man. O'Donnell seems to know everything about Augustine, and to be critical about nearly everything of his spirituality, theology, and personality. This is disappointing. The work provides a detailed but bombastic perspective. I found supplementing this book with the viewpoints of Peter Brown in his new edition of Augustine's biography to be valuable."
2,For use on my HDTV in the mountains,With a HD antenna hooked to the HDTV in my mountain home I can only get one channel. I purchased this booster hoping to pick up two or three other major networks. It didn't boost the signal enough to receive more than the one network.
4,Cleared up my cable signal,"This worked perfectly to improve the picture and audio on my Comcast (non-HD) cable, which was fuzzy before. It's still not perfect, but then, it's cheaper than the monthly premium for HD.The package comes with two 6' coax cables (one of which is for the AC adapter), so it should be all that you need. Note that you'll have to keep this booster plugged in at all times in order for your cable setup to work."
3,Not as much of a boost as I expected,"While this boosted my signal, I still can have reception issues during bad weather. I expected a greater increase in signal strength. I admit, that the way I have it hooked up could be part of the issue. If I turn on the VCR/DVD and watch TV through that, the signal quality improves more."
2,Not as advertised,The specs for the device indicate that the signal strenth would be amplified up to 32 times (15 db). I bought this unit to replace an inexpensive amplifier I had purchased at Home Depot with an advertised gain of 10 db. It appeared to me that the Motorola unit did no better than the cheaper unit.
1,Kills satellite and HD antenna signals,"Tried this unit on both my satellite and VHF/UFH roof antenna connections in all possible locations from house entrance point to right before the TV. It invariably would transform a 70% signal into a 0% signal. I thought the unit might be defective so replaced it for a new one. Same problem. This unit is less than useless for over the air (OTA) signals. The documentation that came with the unit is deceptive in claiming that it will work for OTA applications.Fortunately, Amazon has been very good about returns."
2,"Worse signal WITH ""amplifier"".","I wanted so badly for this to work.I got fewer channels when I plugged this in line.I understand that it works for some people, but not for me."
5,50 mile signal improved,"After the digital conversion, and at 50 miles away from tv towers in Sacramento, our TV signal sucked. We live in the Sierra Nevada mountain range on a ridge and brought in only 2 channels with reliable constant pixelation-free viewing and 2 channels with constant interruptions and 2 channels unwatchable due to almost constant pixelation and lost signal. After the easy installation of this booster, we now get reliable and constant tv signals from over 10 stations. Even the one network station that was unwatchable most of the time is now watchable most of the time. This is an awesome unit and Ihighly recommend it."
2,Hurt reception.,This hurt reception of OTA HD channels from my roof mounted antennta. Very disappointing.
1,The Jury is out,"I bought this booster to improve my indoor reception to my HDTV. I used an amplified indoor antenna as my source. Apparently, it's not producing enough signal to be amplified. I'm going to have to figure out another way to get a s signal. Apparently, my house's walls reduce the signal too much. Either with or without the booster, I don't see several channels. In other words, I'm not sure this booster works."
1,GREAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE ANYWAY,I purchased the Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier less than 30 days ago for a replacment of a failed Leviton Amplifier that had been in service for about 4 years. The initial setup was very easy and I was very pleased with the signal which was a big improvement over the Leviton. The bad news is that after less than 30 days the Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier has failed and I have experienced a total loss of all of the previously active channels. The power light is still glowing but the AC adpter is very warm [if not hot] to the touch. It's too late to return but not to locate a [hopefully] more reliable Amplifier.
5,Works great for HDTV with antenna,"I used this product so I could place an antenna in a spare bedroom, boost the signal, and plug it in to our home coax wiring. I can then get great HD signals throughout our house without an awkward antenna in view."
1,Not for a latop tv tuner.,The signal tuner amp is for a home set up and way to big for a latop. This item comes up as recommended purchase but not for latop users. I'm sure it's a great product but it is not meant for a laptop tv tuner. I did my homework but until I had the amp there was no way of knowing. So becareful before you buy this. it's really big!
1,Motorola Signal Booster USELESS,This signal booster was a complete waste of money; it did absolutely nothing to the cable signal or TV reception.
2,"Made things a little better, but not really.","I intended to use this device to boost the signal to my cable modem and an analog Slingbox I recently purchased. A regular splitter would cause my cable modem to lose connection every 10-15 minutes so, I thought I would give this a shot. Now the connection stays up for a few hours, but the signal still fades to the modem. Since the Slingbox is useless without the internet connection, this device was of no use to me."
4,Made a big difference,"This made a big difference in my analog cable reception, which is on the same feed as my broadband internet data. There is still some noise in some channels, and I'm tempted to add one of Monster Cable's low resistenc splitter to replace the cheap little one I bought at the hardware store, to see if that additional tweak helps things."
4,Good Product with one drawback,Being a bit on the frugal side we bought one of these to boost our over the air TV signal. It has served very well and boosted the strength of our signal quite a bit. The one drawback I have had is that the first one purchased got fried by lightening rather quickly when nothing else in the house was harmed. The improvement of the signal was worth it though and we quickly purchased another one.
4,Very Good for off air HDTV signals with regular antenna,"OK, here is a little backgroud. I have an old 6ft antenna on the roof of my house and I have a 55 inch widescreen but was unwilling to shell out for a new antenna and installation. Signal was already there but weak. About 33 - 45%. Installed the listed item and now can receive a beautiful picture. The only down side is that there still seems to be a little glitch at times for a minute or soo but it sems to be weather dependant. I also looked at the Terk version but felt this was the better option. If you already have a signal and need the extra boost to see a clear picture I definately suggest purchasing this unit. It will help."
1,This item does not work for me,I bought the Motorola Signal Booster based on the great review however it does not work for me at all. Too bad.....
2,Only Minor Improvement,I saw only a minor improvement in my RV which has an amplified antenna. The fact that the RV is under an aluminum carport seems to be a problem. I guess there was not much signal for this unit to boost.
4,Booster Helps!,"Iinstalled the signal booster as mycable modem is a long distance from the cable box of the sstreet and the signal was borderline. I do not have the equipment to measure the signal now however since I installed the booster I have not been losing my connection at the samee rate that I had been. Additionally, TV reception is noticably improved. I definitely recommend this item!"
1,"I experienced a signal loss with this ""booster""","I live in Roswell, GA, and wanted to use this booster to increase my signal coming from an ""Antennas Direct DB4 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna"" mounted in my attic. I currently have 1 run from the antenna in to a single television (no splitters, unnecessary connections, etc), and receive all channels available in my area (some with less than 50% signal strength). I added this signal booster, and signal strength from my strongest channel (WSB channel 2) went from a max of 98% w/o the booster to a max of 48% with the booster. Needless to say, I was hoping for the opposite results. I am processing an RMA, and hope that my refund will be credited shortly. I'll still be out the cost of shipping."
5,Really works with antenna,I am using this with an HDTV antenna and the results are really great with any length of coax cable.
2,not as good as you might think...,"I bought this after hooking up a Digital Stream DTV converter box, hoping to eliminate pixillation on one channel. Signal strength didn't increase one bit. It's not any weaker, but it sure didn't boost it as advertized. I moved it to the other converter box and got the same results. Maybe my antenna cable run is just too long (85ft) for it to be effective.One note... follow the instructions and plug it into the wall outlet AFTER connecting the antenna cable or you'll get a nasty shock."
5,Fixed low cable internet signal level,"Due to an old household cable wiring job, featuring too many splitters and RG-59 cable, moving our PC to a different room caused intermittent cable modem signal loss, sometimes for days. Testing indicated that downstream power level was -23dBmV, which is so low it's suprising that the modem ever worked. I installed the amp where the cable enters the house. Signal level went to -7 dBmV, which is well within specs.) The modem works great and television picture quality increased dramatically. Deeper brighter colors, no more snow on some chanels, and 60Hz hum lines disappeared."
3,signal for cable TV,"I got this to boost the signal from the cable company in my home. I have a bunch of TV's and not all got a good picture and all the channels didn't come in. While it did help some channels some didn't really get better. So, i put another way down the line. It helped a little more. A few months later the cable company came to my home and asked to check my signal. They said there was some signal problems and traced it to my line. They can in and took the boosters out and replaced a cable splitter (probably the root of the problem) hooked up to their computer and everything comes in great on all the TV's. So, I am not using them now. The cable company didn't charge anything either. Wow. So I don't know if the booster did it's job or not. I heard that they don't boost the full spectrum of the cable bandwidth but act like a bell curve on their boost. I don't know if that's true or not but I'm loving my cable company right now. Until they raise the cable prices again..."
5,Just as advertised,"My new rooftop mounted antenna was only providing intermittant reception of some stations. Coax running from the mount location exceeded fifty feet and was split to four televisions. After reading reviews I purchased this booster and it did the trick. I am now receiving all the area broadcast stations without any ""pixeling"" except for an occasional unexplained and momentary signal loss. The product, for its purpose is worth five stars but the positioning of the coax connections (in, out, power,) could be improved. Highly recommended to solve weak signal delivery."
1,Didn't work for me,I have a cable modem and cable tv. This item did not improve either. It soon burned out. Make sure you get the exact booster for your system.
3,Motoroal Signal Booster,"If you are attempting to boost signal on your cable tv, this might concept might work for you, but if your intentions is to boost broadband, get a switch. Any Linksys switch like the SD205 will regenerate signal and its only $30 in Amazon."
1,Junk. Don't Waste your money.,"Live in Philadelphia about 6 miles from the TV stations. Was getting good OTA signal strength before digital switch for my local NBC station. After the digital switch the signal strength dropped. tried moving my antenna, didn't work. Bought this piece of JUNK over Amazon.Installed today to get better OTA digital signal. No change in strength of signal. Total waste of my hard earned [...]Gave it one star because there is no way to give negative stars.Don't Waste your money."
3,does what it says.,Does exactly what it says. Boosts the signal fine. Will not work if you already have an amplifier. The two cancel each other out. I needed my signal boosted but also split. I won't be using it here. Perhaps I will give it to someone else.
2,Miserable Strap,Miserable watch for a seiko. expected more the strap design is a nightmare. the color seems faded
5,A Super Book,"Smaeerah and Tony was made for each other. This book is entertaining and full of twists and turns. I lost a few nights sleep finishing this novel. You will enjoy this one. My favorite book is still ""All for Love"" by Ms. Manees. This book comes in on a close second."
5,Big Girls Get Their Day,"This is the first novel I've read by this author. What a wonderful way to be introduced to her work. The main character, Sam, is a full figured woman with a positive attitude and a strong will. The issue of Sam's weight is NOT an issue to the fine brother, ""Carl"" Tony Harmon, or to the rest of the supporting characters. This book will hopefully show the world that big woman are also beautiful, and there are good, decent people out there who love them unconditionally...especially when it comes to the love between a man and a woman.This book made me laugh (frequently), become misty eyed, and cheer. May there be many more books written and published about big beautiful women. To Ms. Manees, You Go Girl!!!"
3,Great until 6-9 months,"We loved this little stroller until my daughter turned about 9 months. It is too narrow so we now have to purchase another light stroller. One of the seat belt buckles also broke too. Also, the umbrella shade thing is a bit annoying."
5,This movie rocks!,Street Fighter 2 is a must-see for Anime Fans or Video Game fans! You really don't even have to be a fan of either to like this!
5,"Works well, economical","Works for me! I have diabetes and use cream on the tops of my feet and on my ankles and legs to stop skin from the itching caused by poor circulation and the extremely low Colorado humidity. Most other creams work fine, too, but some are too thin to last very long. This cream is thick and fairly heavy. It lasts all day and night. Absorbs quickly and once absorbed is not sticky. It feels sticky going on. It is not greasy at all.Here's an important tip. Put it on after a morning shower while the area is still very wet. Don't use too much -- I use a whole lot less than with Eucerin, for example.Wet your hands with warm water before using it and slather it around in a very thin layer. The wetter you can keep the area the better. Add water when needed while applying. The stuff will last forever using it this way. If you put this cream on dry skin it will be hard to spread and will not work as well."
5,Amazing!,I have a 10 1/2 month old baby at home who has suffered from Exzema from month three. We found that other lotions that were doctor recommended clogged his pores and made him break out into a heat rash. The Vanicream was recommended by a friend and a pharmacist. It is very pricey but work every penny. We bathe our son every other night and lather him in it. There are still the exzema trouble spots that we have to treat with a prescription but the vanicream has prevented excess dry skin by trapping the moisture in. Another word of advice... if you have well water and use rust remover salt this is a huge irritant to sensitive skin. A pharmacist recommended mixing the rust remover salt and regular salt together. With these simple changes our son has less rashes and is a happier baby for it!
5,Vanicream,"Product is great. It was first recommended to me by a plastic surgeon after laser surgery on my face. Now I use it all the time. Service from Amazon was fast and efficient, however, I now see that Walgreen's is selling the exact same product with the pump for only $12.29. Quicker and easier than internet purchasing."
2,"Okay, but not great.","My 3-year-old daughter has severe eczema, and I was hoping this cream would give her some relief. It worked okay the first couple of times I used it, but like everything else, was useless afterwards. I won't purchase this again."
3,"Very poor shipping, but fast refund",I ordered the nails three months before I finally received them. During the wait for shipping I purchased the nails elswhere so I could complete my woodworking project. I attempted to cancel the order three times without sucess; could not get any response. The nails where shipped anyway.I did request a refund from the company and they quickly refunded my money. Just wish the shipping and communication would have been better would have saved a lot of trouble.
5,Mom thinks its great,I bought book for my mother who wanted it for my brother whowanted it for his 12-year old......whew.....Anyhoo my mother and brother both said it was 'exactly what he needed' for introducing this 'subject'
2,Pretty but Stains the Feet,"The socks are really pastel pretty in their maryjane design. However lint, dye (black) gets into my baby's toes and in between. It doesn't help 'coz she has clammy feet. Even if I did a first and 2nd wash there is still color transfer."
5,Perfect Baby Socks,"These are perfect -- 6 socks for $20 is not cheap but not that bad, either. Comparable to Gap socks. The colors are adorable and my baby gets compliments every single time she wears these. The gummy non-slip soles are helpful for crawlers and walkers and the elastic on top is just right - not too snug on babies that have ""shapely"" ankles! An adorable gift for a new mom or baby or shower, too."
3,"Cute, but not sized correctly","These socks are so cute, but only when they fit correctly. For my daughter, these fit best when she was wearing a size 1-2 shoe (between about 4 months and 7 months). After that, they're just too small."
3,These should probably come in more sizes,"These socks are adorable and the quality is excellent. I just wish they were sized 0-6 and then 6-12. The idea that these socks are going to fit a newborn and a one year old is ridiculous. My daughter is six months old and these fit her well now, but they would have fallen off of her before about three months and probably will only fit her for a few more months.I'd guess these are comparable to a 6-9 month size, so in between a 0-6 and a 6-12."
3,Trumpette Mary Jane Pastel Baby Socks,"I love these socks for their cuteness factor; however they definitely were over priced. I purchased the ""0-12 months"" size, but they would have been more accurately labeled 4-8 months. I'm sorry to say I have to agree with a common complaint ... the black part of the ""shoe heal"" needs to be redesigned higher. More than not, the socks would slip off my daughter's heal making the ""shoe"" part of the sock appear to be falling off (which it probably was). I also was a bit disappointed with the wear factor. After a single washing on the delicate cycle and line drying, the socks appeared a bit ""nubby."" Additional washing were done by hand, also line drying, but the socks still showed more wear than I wold have liked, especially when one expects better quality due to the higher price. Lastly, my daughter was able to kick these socks off quite easily."
4,So adorable,"I bought these for my granddaughter before she was walking/standing when she didn't need shoes. They were absolutely adorable! Now she is walking and I put them over her socks when she visits. Reason: she slips on the ceramic floor in socks but these have non-slip bottoms. Although she is getting big for them, they still work to keep her from slipping."
4,"nice names, but not a very large selection","We found our baby's middle name in this book. The book is rather thin, with fewer names than in many other baby name books, but there are enough nice names to make this a worthwhile buy if you are looking for a Spanish name."
1,CRAP!,THIS TOY WAS A PIECE OF CRAP! I HATED IT! I LIKED THE TINKLE TIME KELLY DOLL BETTER BECUZ SHE ACCULLY WENT TO THE BATHROOM! BUT THIS DUMB THING DOES NOT BUT DISAPPEAR AND THEM IT MAGICALLY REAPPERS! IT IS THE WORST TOY EVER! I DO NOT RECOMEND IT TO NE ONE!
5,Entertaining Just Got Easy...and Fun!,"As someone who loves to entertain but often gets too caught up in the perfection of it all, I found Allana Baroni's ""Flirtini"" to be the perfect cocktail party guide -- one that got me to relax, take the pressure off myself, and get to the fun of flirting. From tasty drinks to great (and easy) themes, ""Flirtini"" can get the mind of even the most jaded entertainer pumping with new ideas...and for the novice, it could easily become the bible for cocktailing! Plus, you learn not only how to be a good host, but how to be a good guest -- can't we all use a little help there.In a word, ""Flirtini"" ROCKS! ANd, whoever said cocktail parties are dead clearly never met Allana."
5,Home Run!,Laplink has hit a home run with PCsync. I bought a 2nd PC and I needed to get my files over to it (Including contacts) and it took me under a 1/2 hour to get it done.Thanks Laplink!
4,It's alright!,"I did like the video but not as much as the others, but it did offer some good episodes that I have not seen for a while so it was alright."
4,Great package for the money,We bought this product a couple of years ago at Staples. We bought it primarily for the backup tool and because the price was so reasonable. We have had not issues with it and the backup tool has served us very well. Good package for the price.
5,master lock 3060dat lashing strap,"I used these master lock lashing straps to hold down a luggage carrier on top of my suv during vacation. They worked well during a 10 hour drive. I checked them a few times and they held up well. They were very easy to use, and would recommend these. their alot easier to use than racheting tie downs."
4,double check your mattress size!,"these straps seem fine, sturdy and as non obtrusive as they can be, My problem was that I bought extra long mattresses so they were not long enough. these are made for two twins to convert to a king. not two extra long twins, which equals the actually size of a king. and there is no slack in these straps. we had to go to home depot and buy a 16ft strap to replace one of the 12 ft straps. but we did buy the same type of strap. I am also slightly concerned of how the mattress edges will respond to the pressure of the straps over time. i'm a little afraid they will slowly wear through the fabric casing on the mattress, but so far, no issues."
5,Perfect!!!,"This strap was exactly what I had been looking for. It was the right length and weight classification for the intended use. Love it!, probably will get more when the need arises."
1,Too Stupid,"I tried to like it. I'm originally from Michigan, the lower peninsula though. I laughed one time, the rest of it was just too weird for words. My sister and her family (hunters) love the movie and have encouraged me to watch it for years now. I'm really glad I rented it, instead of buying. Just too stupid and not funny for me. (sorry, Jeff Daniels, you're one of my all time favorite actors!)"
5,hilariously funny,this is a must see if your a outdoorsman or just a person with a down to earth sense of humor you got to see this jimmer is the funniest thing i have ever seen had to stop movie 4 times was laughing so hard so take it from me you gotta see this one!!
4,A great time at deer camp.,"I saw this film in the theatre and was thrilled that it came out on DVD and Video. I grew up along the Great Lakes States and have known hunters all my live. I recently saw this with a Michigan DNR officer who said that there are hunters like those Jeff Daniels has brought to life in this film. It is a fun movie to watch and made me laugh. I don't think it has much of a redeaming social value, but it was one that I could watch with my teenage sons and all of us could enjoy. I am not sure if one needs to be from hunting territory to enjoy it, or the Midwest, but it is enjoyable non the less. Jeff Daniels is a local boy who knows his roots, it is nice to see him do independent films as well as the blockbusters."
3,"Watch ok, wristband too big",The wristband on this watch is quite generous -- requires someone with a good size wrist. I returned -- received my credit promptly.
5,Awesome and Yummy!,My favorite way to use this product is with a Tuscan brandy called Tuaca with a squirt of whipped cream on top. Yummy
4,Photobooth,This book is somewhere between art and history. I really enjoyed looking at the photographs. It makes you think. A great coffee table book.
1,Boring,"Too long and detailed. She fell in with the wrong crowd but yet she still did not do the ""things"" they did and went to school? Doesn't sound right to me? I actually stopped reading cause it was so tiedious to read."
3,Love and Marriage,"Having recently read ""Fatherhood"", I had high hopes for ""Love and Marriage"". In ""Fatherhood"", some genuine parenting advice was presented. After reading the first chapter of ""Love and Marriage"", I was expecting similar tidbits to be present in this book. I was disappointed.The book really falls apart after the first few chapters. These chapters give an enlightening look into the youthful period when we discover the other sex. After this analysis, the book goes into Cosby's dating disasters that rage on until he meets his wife. The remaining chapters discuss his marriage. These chapters digress into jokes about the differences between the sexes and other humor. While these diatribes are moderately entertaining, they lack the wisdom I have come to expect from Cosby.Because the trademark wit did not accompany the wisdom, I found myself to be disappointed with this book. While I would encourage you to read the masterwork ""Fatherhood"", I do not have high regards for this book."
3,review,"Cute book, great little anniversary gift. Very easy reading. Good for anyone. Funny...love Bill Cosby, he tells it like it is."
1,Karting A complete introduction,"Terrible ! The worst book ever. DO NOT PURCHASE!Very old, not good information and very out of date. A complete waste of money.tf"
1,"A Rockaway Resident's Review, May 1, 1999","I found an old paperback copy of this work in a used book store in Brooklyn. At first, I was intrigued because I live in Rockaway. However, as I began reading the author's narratives, I began to realize that the author herself cannot be from Rockaway. All her characters, whether imagined or based on her ""friends"", are quite depressing and truly have no hope. If that was her intention, to analyze why such depression exists in those who live in a non-connected, sub-intellectual location, she truly made her point. I just wish that she never used Rockaway as her muse."
1,Didn't Work,"This product guarantees that it will turn dark hair blonde. I had Auburn hair underneath due to a very bad salon experience. The directions say leave on a minimun of 20 minutes and a maximun of 90. I left it on for 80 minutes and it turned my hair bright orange. It says that if it doesn't work to your liking the first time to use again but after having it on for so long, I ended up with a chemical rash and had to go to a dermatoligists. So doing again is not an option. I do not recommend unless you have light brown to dark blonde hair, then it may work for you.."
4,A Clear and Direct Guide to Making the Best Decisions for YOU,Ken has put together a clear and easy-to-understand guide to making decisions for your career and your life. His method is simple and it WORKS. I also enjoyed his stories about his clients and how certain decisions immensely influenced their careers in a positive direction. Very practical and a must read!
3,Incorrect product specs,"I had ordered this pool specifically because it mentions that it has a drain plug. I dont want to have to deflate the pool everytime I change the water and when its full its too heavy for me to flip over.So I received this pool today and, you guessed it, no drain plug."
2,Terrible,"O.k, so I didn't have the problem that most reviewers complained about....the pool did have a drain plug. My problem was there were various pin holes in the creases where the pool had been folded. I tried to patch it up but the patches didn't hold. Way to let down a 5 year old on his birthday. We ended up with no pool and a flooded backyard."
4,A Surreal Romantic-Comedy..,"Price of Milk is a contemporary fairy tale with about love where a princess is exchanged for an ordinary girl, Lucinda. Rob, the prince, and Lucinda are happy and they are looking forward to getting married. The happiness lasts until the day when one of Lucinda's friends tells her that men want their women more after fights. In the process they end up getting their quilt stolen in the middle of the night, which adds to the looming predicaments. Price of Milk provides many different ideas that are presented in a surrealistic manner, which actually enhances the impact of the story. The ideas in the story also offer entertainment as well as self-reflection and in the end awards the audience with a clever cinematic experience."
2,"Boring, and Hostile Toward Whites","I wanted to like this book. I'd read some high praise for it, and I am interested in Native American culture and authors, and I've lived in Arizona all my life. But it was boring. I had to force myself to finish it. I also found it hostile to white people. I understand that there are reasons for such hostility, but as a person who is primarily white, but who has some Native American ancestry and much respect for Native American culture, it offended me."
5,It's not about basketball,"This book is really engaging on a number of levels. I love hoops and especially high school and college hoops. I picked this boook up and found in reading it that it's not really about basketball at all. Coach Hurley happens to invest his life in basketball and the players are playing the game but basketball is only the sub-plot to the larger play of Hurley's desire to see these kids make something of themselves. In the end basketball is simply the vehicle used to propel these ragamuffin kids to something better. Hurley could have used anything but it just happens to be basketball. It's a great read for anyone concerned about today's youth. Also, it has an amazing storyline about the inability of some to leave what they've known even if it's killing them or going to."
5,Geared towards a wide audience,"While this book is framed as a college-level textbook (and I am currently reading it as a certification requirement), it is a lot less daunting than many college textbooks. The chapters are short and manageable, and cover a wide variety of topics, from budgeting to taxes to credit cards to mortgages to retirement plans. The concepts are presented in a straightforward manner and the chapters are peppered with supplementary blurbs and side articles. At the end of each chapter, there is a wide variety of review exercises, and throughout the book you follow the ongoing financial journeys of several theoretical families.This book should be used as a primer to real life. One warning, some of the material quickly becomes outdated (for example, the tax chapter), so be mindful of this if you don't have the latest edition."
4,great pin,"I purchased this pin, even though it did not have all the details as the others its still a nice large pin to dress up yout t-shirts. the reason only 4 stars the color inside is not blue its a emerald or a x-mas green"
5,Great buy,In need of a comb? want something a little different here you go. i use it for a money clip and it keeps my hair and beard in line!
5,Refreshing!,"This book by Steve Brown is full of real, funny, down-to-earth writing about the freedom given to those who know Christ and how most of us get entangled by trying to live how we think we ""should."" Savor it, think about it, and take it to heart--you will be glad you did!"
4,Excellent 'get started' guide...,"Eden and Rory have provided us beginners with an excellent introduction into learning to use our Macs to keep those home movies and vacation videos from rotting on the shelf. The dialogue is clear with just enough technical information to give the 'newbie' a comprehensive picture of how to edit video on the computer with confidence. Most notable are their tutorials, which unlike most books of this nature, go beyond covering the use of the computer and provide excellent pointers on movie-making in general. After reading the book, not only have I been able to make entertaining videos through the editing techniques they describe, but my original footage has improved as well through their guidance on how to use my DV camera to get the best results. Thanks guys!!"
4,My son loves it,My two year old son really likes it and always wants us to show him how to write his name on it.
1,Broke Immediately,"This shaver is a dual power, with option to use either batteries or adapter. I found it heavy with the batteries but did work well for one day (about two hours of continuous use) then quit completely. Next time I tried to start it up, it would not start, either with batteries or adapter. Save your money and don't waste your time buying this one. There are better."
4,Electric Fabric Shaver- Works Pretty Well,You have to plug it in and you also have to use it on a flat surface but it works pretty well.
1,Almay Truly Lasting All Dayip Lipcolor - Raspberry #270,"I generally love this product but wear different shades than Raspberry #270. This one is oily , runs, smears and definitely doesn't last. Really bad product."
4,"Good subject matter, even better narrative","Although an interesting subject matter, the author does an amazing job using the narrative of the thinkers lives to cooincide with their belief system, the only problem is he probably could have done it in about 50 pages less, but overall its a good fast read"
4,...it's the pendant I use most!,"I've had this tiny rainfrog for about three years now. Just for fun, when it rains, I wear him on a 16 inch silver omega. He's become one of my signature pieces, and I never fail to get compliments on him. This pendant is quite small...sometimes people look at it, and then come closer to see what it really is...and then they say...OH! It's a FROG!!! I do notice that my froggie is tarnishing now, not only the silver, but the gold plating. I'll have to figure out how to clean it without damaging the finish."
2,I've seen better movies,"It could have been a better story with another director or better script,Seems like the producers of this movie like Fidel Castro in some way,a lot of famous people in the casting for a poor production,Johnny from Menudo,Jaime Camil,Felipe from Escandalo TV, and ex Miss universe Cecilia Machado,mediocre direction and acting"
5,"Five on a Treasure Island (Enid Blyton, Famous Five)","My 10 year old daughter loves all the Famous Five books. In fact, she read through all 21 stories. For a while, I could not buy these fast enough for her. She was not an avid reader before, but she is completed into these Enid Blyton books. She has also read through the Advanture series (8 stories) and 10 of the 15 Mystery series by the same author."
1,Black coloring peels off to reveal rust color beneath,"I've ordered this same belt from the same company three times over the past three years. Last year and the year before, it was great and I had no problems with it. However, the one I ordered in 2007 started peeling immediately the first time I wore it -- revealing an ulgy rust color beneath the black. I wrote to inquire about a refund, and instead of a refund they sent me another belt which has the same problem. Too bad.... this was a great, wide, useful belt with handy secret compartment, but the peeling black color can't be tolerated."

1,"This printer thinks it's ""smart"". But it's not","If you like a printer that has to think for about 5 minutes before printing out a job (all the while making an annoying series of noises), than this is the printer for you.Another irritating feature is that if you run out of yellow ink, it won't allow you to print, even though what you're printing is black and white and doesn't involve any use of yellow ink.Speaking for myself, I'd rather have a printer that didn't feel the need to make decisions for me. Please, Epson, let the user make decisions. Don't impose your ""smart"" printer's ""thinking"" on the user."
4,prince,This book gave an interesting description of the Giuliani years and the context in which he came to power. It was quite discouraging how so many other New York politicians put their own power and politics above the interested of New Yorkers.
1,Terrible! It melted on first use!,"The very first time I tried to use it, the non-stick material melted. Yes. I mean MELTED. It was just lucky I noticed before I ate anything or I'd be at the hospital having my stomach pumped. Don't watse your money. Look elsewhere."
5,Read this book!,"This is probably my favorite book on the beliefs of the Mormon church. Unfortunately, I loaned my only copy to a friend and it was never returned. I cannot find anther copy. Mrs. Scott offers a well thought out and readable explanation of the beliefs behind this cultic religious group."
2,What Happened!!??,"If I hear one more slow, sappy ballad by these guys then I'm going to scream. What happened to the fantastic dance songs like ""Larger Than Life"" and ""It's Gotta Be You"" from ""Millennium""? Everything on here is sloooow and boring except ""Get Another Boyfriend""(which is actually very good) and ""The Call"" which has incredibly stupid lyrics(listen to the remix of it. It's ten times better than the original). I'm not saying that BSB shouldn't have changed their sound at all, I just don't think they should've changed it this much...."
5,Well worth the wait.,"After Millenium we were all very exited about the release of black and blue, and after a long wait we were not disappointed. Its kind of different to Millenium and i like it. Dont be mistaken by thinking its just for teenage girls because my dad listens to it more than me! All the songs are sung realy well, the only one that i dont like is 'shining star' but others like 'the call' and 'shape of my heart' are exellant. 'get another boyfriend' is also another of my favorites, although it does sound like a song the more recent Britney Spears would sing."
3,Could have been better . . .,"While the Backstreeet Boys have always stayed with the same sound, this album plunges into new territory, which is not a good thing. The Call is hard to be taken seriously, and It's True is flat out boring. Get Another Boyfriend and Shining Star are the only highlights of the album, since many of the songs are mediocre. They have matured however, so it's a bit interesting to hear that in their songs. Also some of the members co-wrote some of their songs as well, so listen for that. If you really love the Backstreet Boys, get this CD. If you haven't, but are curious about purchasing an album, stick with Millenium as this CD is not a great example of their style."
2,Could improove,"This cd is not one of my favorites, and I don't quite understand why girls are so crazy over it. WAIT, don't rush off on me now, because when I say that , everybody thinks I'm crazy. For example, the first song on this cd talks about these guys cheating on their girlfriends. Why would you love these guys when they see this beautiful girl and drop their old one on the turn of a dime??? Another thing, the second song, it's about a guy who has ""kept you in the dark"". Now he wants to ""show you the shape of his heart"". I think you already know his shape, broken because he thinks the relationship is all about him. One last thing, I wonder why they didn't put the lyrics inside the pamplet on the cd... These are just my opinions. Don't get me wrong, these people have beautiful voices and they have great talent. They just don't show it through the lyrics."
1,Who Is This?,"This is nothing like the usual dance music I've come to expect from the Backstreet Boys & N'Sync. This album is a 180 degree turn for them. There are only 4 upbeat songs, all the rest are love ballets. It's just not what I lookforward to hearing form them."
1,*SIGH*,this cd stinks mega...one of my friends has it and i heard it and it just makes me hate them more....i wish they'd just go away...this cd is the pits...
4,Critique of post-Decadent Musique Facile for Fecaphiles,"Upon hearing, quid foedaratis puere? to myself. Indeed, with so transparent a device, who might deny their middling simulata? Vale, compatriots. Sing on!!!"
5,BSB are the bestest of all time!,"BSB are much, much better than any other bayband and a million times better than NSYNC at least. I don't know how they come to even compete with the pop legend, BSB. So what, NSA and Celebrity are their two biggest-selling albums, they didn't do anything, it's their producers who should get the credit. Yeah right, JC produced the songs, well anyone can do that. They can't even sing. BSB sing good and they write good. NSYNC's music is for childish teenyboppers and obsessed NSYNC fans and no one else.Oh well, enough about competition, on with the songs:The first five songs, More than that and The Answer to our life deserve 5/5. The rest deserve 4 to 4.5/5. That's all what I had to say. BSB forever!"
3,Same old stuff,"Basically this album is the same old Backstreet Sound. So if you liked ""Millenium"" then your probably gonna like this album but if you are looking for something new and diffrent from the typical backstreet sound I wouldn't recomend it."
3,BSB,"Ok right off the bat I'm gonna say I like 'N SYNC more. However I have always been a fan of BSB. I liked Millennium and there first album was ok too. This one so far sounds good except for the fact they seem to be copying a certain rival boyband(who shall remain nameless). Now c'mon the song ""I Promise You?"" Sound familiar? Maybe ""This I Promise You?"" Even look t the lyrics, ""I Promise You"" > ""til death do us part,"" ""This I Promise You"" > ""til the day my life is through."" You don't need a brain to figure this one out folks. The BSB's sound has always been the same and all of a sudden another boyband decides they need a new sound and so does BSB. At least that other boyband had good reasons, what are BSB's?? To be better or maybe to try to get back a certain part of their youth audience who left them? Their sound is(well, used to be)more mature and their attitudes are far too serious for this new album. All in all it is a good album, but not the norm for BSB."
5,Backstreet's Definetly Back,"This album rocks. Plain and simple. It's mature pop. If you get it, you will NOT be dissapointed. Everythings here.. beautiful, gut grabbing ballods and funky, uptempo dance tunes. It's GREAT!!"
4,Talented Artists,"Yes, they are part of the American money-making machine that is today's Pop. But we seem to forget what pop music means. POPULAR MUSIC. The Backstreet Boys certainly fit this description. They are cute boys with pretty voices and harmonies. That's all they are supposed to be. Thus, they have millions and millions of fans who love and respect them. The Boys are talented artists and people should stop wasting energy on trying to take that away from them. This album proves that they are maturing and becoming more and more comfortable with their craft. Just because they make millions without playing their own instruments does not give anyone the right to disrespect or be rude to them. If anything, I respect them for finding and using their talents to make all this money."
1,A disappointment,"I've been looking forward to this CD for a long time - at least ever since *NSYNC came out with NSA - and what a waste of time. With all their talk about how this album is going to be diffently I expected something else. It sounds exactly the same! I've been trying to let it grow on me, but I'm just starting to get annoyed. The only half-way decent song was ""The Shape of My Heart"" and that you can just record off of the radio."
5,You'll love it 'more than that'!,"I have been listening to the Backstreet Boys for a long time and I still love them. Black & Blue is perfect. It's more mature and sincere. Its got beautiful balads and danceable tunes at the same time. My favourites are shape of my heart, the call, more than that, get another boyfriend and everyone.This album may be a bit different from the previous ones butit still rules!Give it a try even if you don't like BSB I'm sure you'll change your mind."
5,Bsb has done it agian,"The Boys have done it agian. they have shown us what excellent artists they are. they wrote more than half the tracks on this album. This cd is a must have for people who like: BSB, Easy listening music, Pop music, and R&B music. Pick this Cd up today!"
1,What A Pity!,"It's too bad Backstreet's career is over. I'll miss them, especially since I've been such a loyal fan since they came onto the scene in '91. The first two albums were so incredible, I couldn't believe how bad this was. Their voices are still great, but they shouldn't be allowed to write music. ""I Want It That Way"" was so perfect. I couldn't have been more dissappointed in ""Shape of My Heart."" ""The Call"" has to be the dumbest song I've ever heard, ""you're dropping out my battery is low, just so you know we're going to a place near by, gotta go."" I'm not kidding, that's really part of the chorus! The only listenable song here is ""Get Another Boyfriend"" the rest is just- BORING!Get ""This Time Around"" ""No Strings Attached"" or ""Sooner or Later"" if you're looking for a boy band worth listening to."
4,BSB,"This album is another great album, but im afriad from the small amount i have heard it sounds like loads more upbeat- the lads do a decent job of these, but many are...well lets just say...they let them down. Once again i love the couple of ballards (as always). I have to say i think its another triumph for the lads and i cant wait to hear the rest of the album!"
4,Useful Data on Oil and Gas Industry,"There is also a CD-ROM version of this book. The information is up to 1997 in the 1999 version. Not very up-to-date but still very useful if you are doing research on the oil and gas industry. The format of the book may not be the best, but it is very clear."
5,classic comp.,"this is a great album. i had a cassette of this back in the day. this album features bloody mary from the bangin on wax cds and many others. if you get the chance, pick this up quick, i know it wont be available for long. gangsta traccs for real."
4,Good TV,"Great tv for extra room. I've had this tv for over 3 years, its a bit cheap and you don't wanna set anything on top of it because the screen goes a lil quirky, for an extra tv this is great its outlasted my nicer tv's."
4,How Not To Get Killed,"This is really just one volume in a 28 book set, all of which are quite good. The series deals with a lot of basic combat and survival skills, and seems to be largely based on British military doctrine and not US. Everything from Urban Combat to catching and preparing wild food is inside. Also lots of photos and illustrations to reinforce the important points.Certainly, this series isn't going to make anyone an overnight Rambo. There's no substitute for really joining military and getting up close and personal instruction. Having said that, I'd say that the books in this series are probably a lot more informative and interesting than the more ""dry"" style of most military field manuals."
1,This isn't even close to being the best English translation,"For readers who want an accurate yet readable sense of what the Chinese text actually means, and not a ""version"" that is modified, distorted, slanted, suburbanized, and massaged in subtle (and some not so subtle) ways for contemporary American readers, I suggest D.C. Lau's translation (available in Penguin paperback) or either translation by Robert Henricks (he has two that incorporate recently discovered ancient manuscripts).I am a professor and scholar in the field of Chinese religions, and I have carefully read the Chinese text and compared it to available translations.Don't be misled... and above all, beware of ""translations"" by people (such as Stephen Mitchell) who don't even read Chinese!!!"
1,Dull. Boring. Somnambulant with a side order of sleep,"The trial was exciting in the newspapers here, but I didn't see any of it in this book. Having been born and raised in Wilmington and being a big fan of Chris Barrish's work in the newspaper I thought this bok would show me the stuff he couldn't put in his newspaper articles. I don't know what went wrong, maybe he shouldn't have written it with someone else. It's confusing and there's like two different points of view. Chris deserves better. I hope he doesn't get known for this slop."
5,"Yes, this one is a must read!","I absolutely fall in love with this book. Ms McFarland has open my eyes to the talent that so many people has said she has! Marc(with an a c)and Davida are wonderful together. I loved the story line. Everything about the book was great, unusual meeting, the age difference issue, long distance relationship, ready made family,and a love that will stand to the test of time! I did leave out the best part of the book(in my opinion), just so you will have something to look forward too! Please go and get yourself a copy, you will not be disappointed!"
2,"it had promise, but...","...I kinda liked the single ""Soulcrusher"" that was on the radio, which is why I chose this CD out of the other choices I was given (I won it off the radio), but none of the rest of the album even compares to the powerful lead single (and first track as well, way to kick things off!). Maybe I expected too much: they sounded like a cross between ""Badmotorfinger""-era Soundgarden and ""Appetite For Destruction""-era Guns'N'Roses at first, but that was too much to pull off for any extended period of time (like by the end of the second song?), and it quickly dissolved into a second-rate Buckcherry without the party attitude; nobody's getting ""Lit Up"" here...I should have picked the Finger Eleven CD instead..."
4,Better than the bad reviews...,"Ok, I've read all these reviews saying ""the first track was great, but after that I didn't like the rest"".I tell you what, if you really want an album where all the tracks are the same just stick the first damn track on repeat..This is a pretty good album, with a good mix of songs that wont leave you thinking that they all just sound too similar.As for the lead singer trying to sound like Cornell, yeah, he sounds a little like him....a LITTLE. His style reminded more of Axel Rose than cornell sometimes, in fact the whole band and style reminded me of G'N'R (listen to the chorus of 'Nothing at all' and tell me it's not Roses'esque), but I liked it, I liked it a lot.If you want a good rock album that isn't too 'pop' or too heavy, or doesn't have 12 songs of some guy simply screaming his head off, then buy this album.If I had to use two words to descibe this album, they would have to be 'pleasantly good'."
2,"It's okay, but don't get out of your way to get it","This Spanish Grammar is okay. It was written with the English speaking person in mind who is attempting to understand the structure of the Spanish grammar in a comparative basis. It is useful, don't misunderstand me, and portable, but I have found an even better grammar book in ""A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish"" by John Butt & Carmen Benjamin. It's not as portable, but certainly extremely useful and thorough for those English speakers who want to delve into grammar intricacies of the Spanish language.A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"It was disappointing. I was looking for a dvd with either music videos of the songs or live performances of the songs, or both. I got neither. I do love The Gathering but this dvd wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Just waht I needed,"I've been training in kenpo for 12 years and I got more out of Timing in the Martial Arts as far as learning when to attack, than I have ever gotten from my sifu.The book is loaded with great stuff, it's even comical in places. And I got to say, Loren Christense isn't too hard on the eyes.Great book.Christie Stone 2nd Dan"
4,An excellent guide to a topic that is seldom talked about with fighters.,"I have had an opportunity to review this author's numerous books and videos and I have found most of them are fantastic. This fine book was no exception. It covers a topic that is seldom covered in books and videos on fighting and self-defense. This book has numerous drills that will help anyone improve their chances in the ring or on the street.All things considered, this is a book that should be read by anyone who is interested in improving their timing and speed skills both in the ring and in street combat.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics System)."
1,Do not buy this TV!,"Problems I have faced so far:* There is a constant humming sound anytime the TV is on. It is loud enough even when the volume is set to medium.* The picture quality is definitely below other similar TVs manufactured by SONY or Samsung* On top of it all, it just stopped working one day after only 2 months of purchase! Panasonic service support is far from helpful, so don't even count on them. At this point I am just waiting for them to call me back.If you find this review helful, do me a favor and spread the bad word around so that panasonic stops cheating innocent customers."
3,100 Words or Less,"Lightweight but fun novel. No real depth of meaning here, but that's okay.It's an enjoyable read and somewhat surprising at times. Excellently crafted. If you're looking for something easy and weird, then this is perfect."
3,Difficult to match with the right reader,"I adore Jack Gantos (specifically A Hole in My Life). This is a beautifully crafted story BUT I don't know any readers to match to it. (And I meet a new batch of 100+ teen readers every year). It was beyond creepy to me and my favorite show of all time is ""Six Feet Under."" My skin crawled more than it does when I read Poe, Faulkner, Dahl's ""Landlady,"" etc. The prose is perfectly executed but I felt nauseated for most of the tale."
2,Ugh...,"I, too, cannot see this book appealing to a general audience of young adult readers. For starters, they would get bogged down with the time-swapping nature of the novel. I also think that the pure-blood, genetics, science flavoring of the story becomes slightly confusing and boring in parts. Also, the underlying feel of incest begins, by the end, to feel a bit icky. It wasn't scary. I can't imagine anyone comparing it to Frankenstein. If teens are really interested in literature that has a more gothic flavor, I suggest something by Libba Bray. For me, this one just wasn't a keeper. I am going to donate it to the local library on Monday."
2,Not a good book on antisocial personality disorder,"If you like nurture arguments more than nature, read this book. He actually uses sociopath and psychopath meaning one who is socialized into becoming a psychopath versus one who is born. I don't agree with it, nor do the foremost experts on the subject. If you enjoy sociobiological explanations for rape and murder and psychopathy, then it's probably for you. For those of you who think, however, read Without Conscience by Hare, he is a foremost expert on the subject and doesn't meander through an essay on why he thinks people are psychopaths, but gives portraits of psychopathy and doesn't shy away from the fact that much of antisocial disorder and psychopathy occurs randomly. This is NOT a good book. It's full of irrelevant information and just plain wrong conclusions."
5,Informative and Chilling,"I've read a number of the 9/11 related books out there and this is one of the best. I learned many things I either didn't know or had misconceptions about. For example, I'd heard that most of the 9/11 hijackers didn't know it was a suicide mission- a somehow comforting thought. McDermott makes the convincing case that every one of them knew they were about to die and embraced their path to paradise. This is a must read for anyone who wants insight to what these fanatics were really thinking."
5,Trying to understand it all,"This book provides a very readable history of Islamic Fundamentalism. It is worthwhile reading for anyone who wishes to understand how 9/11 came to be and what challenges face the U.S. now from fundamentalist terrorists. It rises above the political din - not alarmist in tone, nor dismissive."
1,Never again!,"I'm very disappointed about this watch. it's not possible to read time in the darkness because the numbers don't light up. I do not recommend this product because it is useless.Nevertheless, it has a cute design."
2,Just a trinket,"This is a really different looking watch, with a surprisingly hefty, expensive feel to it.........unfortunately, it's of such poor quality that after one month of use, the first battery was dead. I got the battery replaced, and one week later, it was dead also. The display is impossible to read in bright light, and in the dark, you have no idea what you're looking at, as only the diodes light, not the numerical display. Very disappointing."
2,Didn't work,"After using this shampoo, my dogs were itching more than ever. It didn't give them the healthy coat I was hoping for!"
4,An Excellent Value for the Price.,"For the price, this recorder provides a nice sound which, while not on par with top-of-the-line recorders, is an excellent value. The tone is good and the notes ring true. It comes in a nice carrying case. The only disappointment was in the provided cleaning rod, not really something to clean the recorder, but rather a piece of abrasive plastic - perhaps not even the intended accessory."
3,It's good for about 2 minutes,Love the flavor haven't had it in probably 20 years since was a kid. just flavor don't last but a minute or two.
4,Must Get It,Anyone who is doing any type of physical activity must get this book. Even my own physical therapist loved it! For kids: Also recommended: Sports Medicine For Parents & Coaches
5,Best 12-minute album you'll ever hear!,"At over fifty cents per minute these had better be great songs, and they are. There are enough hooks here for the last 3 GBV albums, which should tell you how great the old stuff was (sorry Bob - I understand your need to evolve though). The disc (at least the old version I have) comes in one of those low-budget cardboard covers similar to LPs, which seems to cause this disc to disappear from my collection and then reappear occasionaly for several consecutive listenings. The cliche ""pop gem"" truly applies here."
1,Not for the tween,"I had ordered this book for my twelve year old and was really disappointed. I was hoping for a tasteful book that talked a little about the birds and the bees as well as body changes. What I got was a book that dicusses oral sex, anal sex and it's Ok to be gay. Too much for the child barely becoming a teen.I would not recommend it. I returned it."
5,The ABC's of Successful Leadership,"I teach a course on Leadership Principles in the Call Center industry. Ray's book provides excellent insight on what is important in leading large groups of people and motivating them to peak performance. We use numerous excerpts from Ray's book in our course material. The book is an efficient and effective manual on the ""art"" of leadership."
2,"Interesting quotes, etc. Poor value for the HIGH price!","Interesting grouping of quotes and stories. No new information and very little content. Most pages are 75% ""white space."" Not a very good value for the high price."
1,This cd really stinks!,"As a long time Bruce Hornsby fan I was excited to hear this new cd and certain I would listen to it often...boy was I wrong!! Not only will I not listen to it often, I didn't even make it through once! Gone is the piano, gone are the artful and relevent lyrics, gone are the powerful and thoughtful arrangements, gone is the natural sound of a wide range of instruments in the music. In it's place is an overly synthesized, uninteresting and weak attempt at fusion jazz with a rap bend. This cd should probably be in the R&B section if you look for it at the store! If you like the Bruce Hornsby that gave us such great cd's as ""Hot House"" and ""Spirit Trail"" you will hate this cd. In fact, I can't think of anyone who would like this cd...it's just plain awful."
1,Big Swing Face (Farce?),"I saw Big Swing Face on sale at my local store and grabbed it up since it was by Bruce Hornsby. I hurried home, shoved the CD in the player and expected to hear new songs along the lines of Across the River and Valley Road. I have truly never been this disappointed in any CD I have ever bought. I like at least one song on every CD and tape I own except this one. I have never given away any of my music, but in this case I plan to make an exception; probably to someone I don't much care for. Will the real Bruce Hornsby please come back?"
3,Bruce does Eminem,"Ever since the success of The Way It Is, Bruce has attempted to distance him from its success and its style. When he plays the old faves in concert he jazzes/folks them up. Not a bad thing.This new disc is a further attempt to broaden his musical horizons. Not a bad thing but this horizon doesn't work well for Bruce. It's like he's a 40 something old white guy trying to be a 20 something hip hop star. Very weird. Some tunes are good but there is NO piano and the songs themselves lack the emotional range Bruce is capable of. Very painful considering that is Bruces forte.I love you Bruce. Your music has inspired me for more than a decade but if you really want to surprise your fans release an album in the Style of ""The way it is"" or ""Scenes from the Southside"". Now thats something I know won't happen!Oh BTW, If your new to Bruce, Get ""Hot House"" its Bruce's best album ever and melds the old and new Bruce perfectly!"
1,SHOCKED,"I was very excited after the brilliant Spirit Trail,although I read on a webpage that the album would be very different,I didnt believe it.Boy was I wrong !This goes down with Metal machine music,Zero tolerence for silence,Im in you,and Todd Rundgrens rap cds as one of the worst albums ever,zero commercial appeal.Why the record company would ever release this,Ill never know.Be afraid, be very afraid."
1,Dissapointing,"I could not stand listening to this CD after the first two songs. That is how bad this CD is. I can't wait to go to the CD store and sell it.If you love his previous efforts with the Range and also Hot House, please, do not waste your money on this one."
4,The best portable version of Madden,"MADDEN is easily the best handheld version of the game available. It uses the two touch screens for awesome applications, like selecting plays and calling audibles. It also uses a radar screen during the actual play to show you where all of your players are. Its down side is the graphics. EA should have done much better to show of the capabilities of the DS. Shame on them.Seems people are trying to compare the DS MADDEN to console games. This is not at all fair, since you can't compare to the realism, control, and realistic tackles of the big consoles.That being said, it is still the best portable football game on the market, even with only average graphics and sound.Bottom line is, it is fun to play, and being able to hook up wirelessly with a friend is great."
3,Ok- kind of ez,"When you first start playing Madden 2005 for DS, it is a good challenge and entertaining. However, after the initial thrill is over, the game can get old. EA made the defense on this game way too easy which makes winning a piece of cake. Changing the difficulty level helps a little but not much. You should only get this game if you really love football (like me) and want a portable version of it.P.S. Playing against someone wirelessly is a LOT more fun than playing the computer. The AI is not creative at all."
1,Totally Rushed,"I have litterally owned every Madden since the Sega debut and I can without question say that this is by far the worst version ever. Madden '92 on the Genesis absolutely blows this game away. NFL Football on the Turbo Graphix 16 kills this game. As a die-hard madden fan it is a shame that EA rushed the heck out of this game to make the DS launch. I feel totally ripped-off and duped. What a shame, EA."
2,DissapointedConsumer,The chairs are weak and will not support the average man's weight. This chair was probably ony built for decoration and not for everyday use.
1,Said it was new and sent used,This was listed as a new powersupply for a dell laptop and was priced as such. What I got was a used power supply with someones name on it in an unerasable marker. I complained and they refunded me $20 which made it a reasonable cost for a used power supply
3,Travel to Namibia,I have a daughter their in the Peace Corp. Two of my sons are going there this summer. The video was good as far as it went. But there are more places that they could have talked about. I expected more on Etosha Park and other parts of Namibia.
5,The quintessential book on Bob Marley,"Stephen Davis is a writer extraordinaire. He manages to capture the spirit that was, and still is, Bob Marley. His words transport you into a world of sound and emotion as he describes the life and music of the King of Reggae. He brings us Bob Marley: the man, the champion of human rights, the son, the husband, the proud father, the lover, and the musicmaker. He shows us how profound Bob Marley's short life was and its impact on the world and yet he reveals an ordinary country man dealing with the issues of survival: work, family, crime, political unrest and betrayal. Once you begin reading this book, you will be unable to put it down. At the end, you will be emotionally spent."
3,tries to cover too much too fast,"The topics covered should have taken up a volume at least twice the size, so too much was glossed over. Also I found the errors were just too many, not just minor ones as another reviewer noted: e.g. wrong SDL_Init parameters (he lists the correct ones in a table on the same page) or never explaining that to set a video mode you need to add a declaration (I found it in the original SDL documentation). On the other hand trying to get the examples to work taught me a lot...maybe that was the author's intention?"
3,It could have been better.,"This book was helpful in many regards. It showed the basic idea of how to use the APIs presented. However, allow me to warn that there are many technical errors. When I went to compile and run the included code snippets _as_they_were_written_ I would run into problems like ""unrecognized symbol"" because of an incorrect or missing include file or a program exiting because it looked for the wrong return value from a funcition. Sloppiness like that leads me to sum up: it could have been better."
2,When Grandma and Grandpa Visited Alaska,"This book has many, many statement that direct the child to ask Grandma and Grandpa things about Alaska - The book contains almost no information on its own. In my case, Grandma and Grandpa live over 1000 miles away and see the grandkids only once per year."
3,Words don't really do this movie justice,"This is by no means my favorite movie, but I first was exposed to it when I came across a YouTube clip of one of the scenes. I didn't think this could actually be a movie but after a little research I came across ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"". I have no idea what was said during the whole movie, not entirely sure what the language was. Germanic in origin I think. This movie is all about rebellion, on a surprisingly large scale, ironically enough. If you're a fan of Herzog's work this is at least worth a look, but be forewarned that you may not be able to sit through the whole film - it tends to drag and the high-pitched voices are tedious on the ears very quickly."
4,Access guides are different,"I have used access guides for many cities besides New Orleans. I have found them valuable in New York City, Washington D.C., and even in my home city of Philadelphia. They are unique. Going by street or by area they create a new type of guide which can be very valuable when walking or going though a particularly area. They augment, not replace the traditional guide"
1,A piece of junk,"I bought this TV because it had a good picture and was a good deal. However, my TV suffers from the same high-pitched whining sound that others have complained about. That says a lot about the obviously poor quality of Apex products. And, of course, it's now out of warranty. How convenient for Apex."
4,Can't beat it for the price!,I have had this TV for almost a year now and I could not be happier. I get great picture through cable and through DVD. Sound is great for mono but you can run the sound out through your DVD to outside speakers. Not that hard to do. Honestly I don't know how you could find a better TV for the price!
5,Confronting War,"John Edmund Delezen has done it again. He takes a segment of the Vietnam war and astutely reduces it to honest, human terms. This time however, the Marine veteran produces a challenging narrative from his one-time enemy...a North Vietnamese soldier. The end result...a searing indictment of the brutalizing effect of war on those condemned to experience it down where they do the dying.The author is a soldier, scholar and accomplished poet dedicated to confronting war. He visits Vietnam frequently and regularly communicates with the people in both Vietnamese and French. Consequently, ""Red Plateau,"" will have great appeal to those who want to understand how a Cold War policy created in the Washington corridors of power impacted a society with a long history of survial. Highly recommended.Bert Ruiz"
5,"Why this never made it to disc, we'll never know.","I have several McGarrigle albums, and they're all very good.Anyone whose tastes are not limited to mainstream tripe should be able to recognize their genuine talent. Always intelligent and/or emotive, their original music is well-structured and borne of life, passion and art, as opposed to merely being a means of filling up space on an album.In my opinion, Pronto Monto is their best album, regardless of popular concensus. While it may not have the refinement and fullness of later albums, what it may (possibly)lack in production nuance is overshadowed by the sheer intensity, esprit, and youthful love of life. Two of the best tunes are, respectively, about the birth of a son and the death of a mother; and I defy anyone to listen to either and not well up. The musicians are all wonderful, and each have radiant moments."
1,Painful Installation for Windows 98/ME,"Their installation software never worked from the beginning. You insert US Robotics Installation CD and the ""Launching 3COM Modem Install Assistant"" message but nothing. Tried 3 times and the same result. So I configured it myself by having the windows to detect PnP but I am not sure if I am using the optimal driver. I never had any problems with any other modem such as Zoom or even cheap Taiwan made modems. Stay away with this one."
1,This modem is terrible...,"I thought I was getting a good deal when I bought this modem. After all USR is a respecable name, and the price was decent. I couldn't have been more wrong. The installation was a major pain. It took 5 tries before the installation software even detected the modem. Finally it was up and running... until the next morning. I tried to log on and nothing.. it said there was no dial tone, so I double check the connections and listen for a dail tone, all is good. So I try again... nothing. I have gone through about 3 modems in the last 10 years and this one had to have been the worst. Never had I had this problem before. Save your money and buy a different brand."
3,"Informative, but photos are dull","I found this book helpful because most of the photos are accompanied by an illustration that explains how the lighting was achieved. However, the photos are very outdated (circa 1980) and a bit cheesy. They didn't inspire me to go out and replicate them. A better book is Bambi Cantrell's ""The Art of Wedding Photography: Professional Techniques with Style"". This one is much more modern and innovative."
4,Fun Game,"Sprung is a great game, it's kind of like choose your own adventure, but you have to get it right. It's a relationship game where you can choose to be a guy or a girl. I thought it was fun."
1,sprung,"I bought this game for my ds when i fist got it, and it totally bites the can. i actually fell asleep aftter playing it for 30 minutes, please save yourself and DO NOT BY THIS GAME!"
2,Star Trek Enterprise,"More like a toy than a collector's item. My 12 yr old granddaughter liked it, but doubt it will be kept around for very long even though she is a Trekkie. Plastic - not too impressive."
1,"Poor quality, wrong color.","I received this order today. I used Super Saver shipping but this is ridiculous. It took a month to get here. I definitely won't use Super Saver shipping again while I'm overseas.This item must have been a `factory second'. It was very poor quality. The decals on the sides don't even line up. You can't really read the logos. Additionally, in several areas the glue is very visible. I was very disappointed especially since I waited a month to receive it.As I 'trekker' I've seen many models, pictures and of course the on TV show, and the USS Enterprise is not medium gray. You might convince me it was light gray but this model is too dark.I've been using Amazon for years. This is the first time I've been disappointed."
1,Buyer Beware,"Do not trust this book...have found wrong answers and misleading questions to know how to solve for the answer. Buyer beware. When I called the company about it they said Amazon should give me the refund for my money. I told them this has nothing to do with Amazon that it was shipped properly, etc. The issue is with the content from this company REA that is found in the book."
4,Good quality for the price,"This is a good quality printer for a very good price.Printing is not too fast, but I never had a problem. The software is good and runs great with Xp. Ideal for home use."
2,magnifier subpar,Don't expect too much from this magnifier. Supposed to be 4x but doesn't magnify any better thatn a 1 or 2. Deliver time was adequate
3,Not the Best,"I have an eye disease, and I am constantly looking to the market for good products that will help me read and do things I can no longer do, as for my impaired vision. This product is one of those I did not think highly of. The first thing I found was the plastic, crappy 4X magnification. Instead of a glass lense, it's swirled plastic, a cheap knock-off of a real magnifer. I understand the weight of glass would make it even harder for the arm to support it. The base was sturdy, or heavy enough to support the swing arm and lense from tipping over, but the arm itself was hard to keep up without it falling down. This may be an okay product if you have good eyesight, and use it on a table, using a pliers to tighten the nylon nut. But for my situation, even the 4X magnification seemed less than 4X."
3,An okay book,"I bought this book hoping to use it this year for additional reading for my home school students who are studying American History this year and we live in Maryland. I had high hopes for this book. However, I was disappointed. The writing is overly simplistic and the characters are not well-developed. The author could have added more details to the setting and the events of the time period to give the reader a clearer picture of life in this era."
1,Toxic Warning,"The crackers we received went out of date 04/2009. That's not the worst part. You can't see the expiration date because it's on the INSIDE flap of the box and it must be opened and really searched for to see. Because of this we tasted them before we saw the expired date. These crackers have been stored somewhere where fumes from exhaust or nearby stored chemicals have also been stored for a long, long time. The crackers have been steeped in fumes to the point they are caustic. It made me run to wash out my mouth. My son tasted one at the same time before I could prevent it. He was sick on the spot. I've called Amazon and explained in detail our experience and I hope no one else is poisoned. Someone right now should be going to this warehouse in Nevada and investigating their hazardous food storage practices."
5,D. Simon Evans's Grammar of Middle Welsh,"This is an astoundingly helpful volume on a very difficult subject. The edition I purchased is very nicely bound. This book has a comprehensive glossary, and is very well-laid out."
4,Fascinating,"A colorful look at the beliefs, practices, and culture of many of the religions practiced in the U.S. I've read several books on religion, but they were missing the element of experience that this book offers. Through Ms. Hahn I feel as though I have been given a glimpse into what it is that holds people to the religions they embrace."
3,Decent for the price.,"Was pretty much what I expected. The case is good but does scratch easily, but it isn't a big concern, cause obviously the case is there to take the brunt of the damage away from the actual Zune. The stand seems a bit flimsy but if you are careful with it I don't foresee any problems.I will probably be ordering a couple more of these to put in reserve just in case as the price so so much better than buying a similar product in the stores even with the most expensive shipping option."
1,horrible,I was so excited to get some new ink for my printer! The worse ink EVER! it was very light on the first 2 copies and then no ink! I tried everything to get it to work! GRRRR! Printer Ink is SO expensive and to have it not work is very frustrating. I hope I can return it!
2,Sam can do better,"While her first three albums were quite entertaining, this one lets you down a bit. It's always good to see an artist go his/her own ways and produce an album, but this effort is rather weak in song quality. ""The reson is you"" has been sung by the German artist NINA, but was a flop then already. ""Perhaps"" is another cover version. Nice and funny, but if the cover versions are the only highlight here, that's not a good sign"

3,A Mixed Bag of Memorable Gems and Dull Throwaways,"Samantha Fox has managed to release quite a few exciting and sexy dance songs over the course of career. Unfortunately, you have to weed through a lot of dull ""garbage"" to reach the gems. This album is no exception. ""Just a Dream,"" ""Wasted NRG,"" and her cover of ""Perhaps"" are the real highlights of this CD. Some of the other songs aren't exciting but will grow on you over time. On the flip side, ""I Dream is Colours"" is not only incredibly dull but somewhat painful to listen to. Lyrically, it sounds like something a 13 year old would write and sing. That song, along with ""Say What You Want,"" would be anough to put you to sleep if played back to back. If you like Samantha Fox, there are enough memorable songs on this CD to make it a worthwhile purchase. I just wish she could release an album that was consistently good. On a meaningless side note, I love the album title and cover shot."
2,"Lots of talk, not much actual how to!",Content applies more to a very large scale developer (who probably doesn't need to read books!).
3,Not for NX80,"This is a very nice case. I purchased this for my new PEG-NX80 Clie. Unfortunatly the case is not designed for the NX80. It is a nice, well made case. I only wish they would make one the NX80"
3,Disney Girlfriends,"I got this game for Christmas and it had no instructions!! It is so hard to play with out the instructions. You don't know what buttons you're pressing without them. The game keeps on locking up and it's pretty slow.If you want to get in a chat room or send e-mails to your friends, the friends have to have the game too! Don't buy this game for your daughter unless there is someone that's really good with computers."
5,Childhood Favorite,I bought this book from a school book sale when I was a kid. (I'm 25 now) I was so happy because it was the first book I bought and I loved it! I was disappointed when my mother told me she had thrown it away a few years back. I would love to be able to find this book again to read to my students AND children. Stresses the importance of taking a bath AND listenting to your mother.
1,obviously biased analysis,"As an attorney with a background in antitrust law, I was anxious to find a book that could cut through all the hype surrounding the Microsoft case. McKenzie approaches the case with an obvious axe to grind in favor of Microsoft; now, that's okay, as long as he still makes rational arguments. But his argumentation reads like a law school student trying to prove his antitrust professor wrong. I will give just one example--he argues that Microsoft isn't a ""monopolist"" because they ""only"" control 90% of the market. Anyone familiar with antirtrust law knows that the term ""monopoly"" need not be taken literally, and that market power can be exercised by a firm controlling far, far less than 90% of a market. Such spurious argumentation make you wonder if Bill Gates didn't subsidize this book."
2,didn't the Velvet Underground already make this record?,"Aping, aping and more aping. I give them two stars for at least doing their job passably well. But come on kids, this is nothing new or different. It's a bit slicker than all the stuff it's based on, but is that really a good thing?"
2,Slightly Disappointing - Venezuelan Acid Jazz???,"This is a concoction of Venezuelan Acid Jazz (that's what we call it in London). Slightly funky, slightly jazzy, pretty zany too!Much of this is fairly listenable but there's nothing particularly about it and it's not getting any further air-time on my HiFi after being initially auditioned.I'd probably enjoy it more if my Spanish was more colloquial but I don't get any of the allusions. The band sound like they are having a great time though so......I'd be struggling to recommend this to you - so I won't."
3,Tank Tops,"They arrived in a reasonable amount of time, not as good a fit as I would have liked, but acceptable."
1,Fine if you like wearing dresses.,"First off these tee shirts are ribbed. You'll never know that by the add. Secondly the shirts are about 12"" too long and fit more like a dress than a shirt. They look cute on my wife--but it's not why I bought them. BTW--I'm over 6 foot tall/170# and ordered a small--maybe I need extra small next time?!"
1,DOES NOT SUPPORT MSN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, so I have my box this software came in all cut up to get the rebate, the rebate info is sent off,everything seems fine, when I discover that there is no anti-virus interface with MSN. I was playing with the URL filter and discovered that it did not work with MSN. At the time, not knowing that the program did not support MSN, I attempted to email tech, they sent 3 emails stating they were on the case but no answer. After 2 days, I called them and spoke with a customer service rep who told me about the MSN problem and directed me to the system requirements on page 1-6 of the owner's manual, and sure enough, MSN was not listed. I really think that systems not supported by certain software should be listed before buying. I also am not pleased with Trend's tech support."
5,Smell the Fresh Air,"A real walk in the woods included with this music. I can almost smell the evergreens while listening to it. Beautiful, relaxing, yet invigorating. A breath of fresh air."
4,Hilarious in bed!,"The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1,001 Things You Hate to Love (Stall, Harry, & Spalding), is my official new favorite for that old game of adding ""in bed"" to anything to make it hilarious. From the first entry, ABBA, to the last, Zima, this book chronicles a thousand (and one!) things that you'll want to try in bed with your spouse, significant other, or a random person you picked up on the street (and a couple of good-quality condoms, please!).[...]"
5,Come Play With Me,"Outstanding !!! McPherson displays his brillant ability to communicate and express the Be-Bop message. He is without a doubt, "" The Keeper Of the Flame"". While being heavily influenced by Bird (Charlie Parker) he clearly has established a voice of his own. This recording is a must for any true ""Orinthologist""."
1,Didn't get what I expected,"Perhaps I did not read the description deeply enough, but this did not fit our new ipod nanos."
5,Fryer Queen,I absolutely love this fryer. I will have had it a year @ Christmas. I use it on a average 3-4 times a week and I haven't had one problem with it. Great product.
3,1 day shipping?,"I just received my watch today after ordering on the 19th of this month. This watch is my 1st luxury time piece and overall I'm very pleased. It's a beautiful watch without being over-the-top flashy, which I really like. It's a very comfortable size and lighter than I imagined. The contrasting blue face is classy being framed by the stainless bezel. I had it fitted today by a certified watch builder/repairer and it now feels like a watch that i can wear all the time.My only complaint is the extra amount of $30 I spent for ""overnight"" shipping. It left the seller's facility on the 21st and didn't arrive until today, the 24th. I wasn't aware that the ""overnight"" doesn't apply to orders shipped on Fridays. This should be clarified when ordering in my opinion."
3,Not impressed with the translation,"I am not going to give a synopsis of the book, a lot of reviewers have done it before me. I just wanted to express my disappointment with the translation. While reading the book I could not help myself, but feel that I am reading a literal translation of Russian text rather than Russian book in English.I speak both Russian and English, with Russian being my native language, and after living and working in the USA for more than 30 years, I'd like to think that I know English quite well too."
5,Hits all the right notes,"I wasn't too sure I wanted to read this book after reading the synopsis because it seemed like the kind of book where the author strains too hard to make the content live up to the summary. However, the book actually turned out much better than I expected.It would be hard for me to say that this book belonged in a particular genre because there is a bit of everything in there. There is intrigue, dark humor, drama, tragedy and absurdity. All of these elements are tied together with interesting characters. And, I even liked the twist ending (rare for books with anticipated sequels). I disagree with the reviewers that didn't like the translation. I thought that the writing was light, although with enough seriousness to convey the proper tone for the work.I look forward to reading the sequel."
3,Bounter Hunter Pouch & Trowl Kit,I wish the pouch was deeper- with a snap top/zipper-- because when you place your tools in it- they stay until you bend down to begin digging- then they tend to fall out.
4,cinderellas dollhouse,My 3 year old grandaughter loved playing this game at her friends house so I purchased it for her. Unfortunately it did not work on my computer or on hers. A problem installing. The seller was very gracious and resolved the matter very quickly. As far as the enjoyment of the game her friends say it is great.
5,Excelent book for thoes wanting to learn about deaf culture.,"When I first started to take the ASL class last fall of '98, 'Deaf in America' was required reading. This book was both a shock and an eye opener. Shoched, because I couldn't beleave how cruel one human could be to another human because of an abnoramality. The thing teachers did to Deaf students to make them use words instead of signed language, or jestures. The Deaf community has come a long way to get the things the need to be able to communicate not only among themselves but with the would. I learned a lot."
3,Deaf in America,"Deaf in America provides an interesting insight into the life of Deaf culture explaining many aspects of their world and their culture. While the format of the book took me some getting used to, it was definitely an interesting experience."
1,not well written,"It's not a big wonder this was a free download. It's not a story of their plight as hostages so much as it is the story of how they worked to witness to their captors. As a Christian, I don't see a problem with that per se, but this account is not well written. I was bored after 3 pages and deleted it from my Kindle"
4,God is real,It is so good to read about what God is doing. In a real life setting. About real people & real events.
1,An Utter Failure of a Movie,"This is one of those films that makes me ask the eternal question about cinema: how did this thing ever get financing?The thing is a failure on every level, from the screenplay, to the acting, to the directing. Even the cinematography is awful.I beg you: save your $3.99 and the hour and a half of your life you'd waste watching this thing."
3,"Pleasant, not eternal","With some nice kid acting. This is not great, not anything to make you change your mind about life, but a very fine portrait of a badly parented young man trying hard to navigate between selfish and self-absorbed people and somehow manage to grow up. How he manages to realize whom he can trust and whom he cannot is well done.Life is confusing, with multiple temptations. Realizing that it may be best to avoid what looks delightful is an essential part of growing to adulthood. Most of the ""adults"" in here have not learned that. Even the ones that look ""cool."" And it avoids a couple of clichés I thought it was illegal to not include.A solid 3.5. We enjoyed it and don't regret watching at all."
5,A gem,"Offbeat but touching, funny, full of heart and not afraid to go where it hurts, Goats is indie film at its best. All the characters are real and so well acted. I hesitated to rent this and now I am going to recommend it to everyone. Just lovely."
3,Ok,"A coming of age story, certainly coming from an odd angle. Not a movie for everyone, slow but entertaining in its' odd way"
5,Amazing,"I have been a fan of Patty since the first time I heard Let Him Fly back in 1996. I have all of her albums and I was so excited to purchase this one. I have been listening to it for a few days now and I have to say it is absolutely amazing. Patty's voice and poetic lyrics are perfect. I have never had the opprotunity to see her live so this cd makes me feel like I was there. The live version of Let Him Fly is great, Nobody's crying is beautiful, and Rain is flawless. I would give this album a million stars, but I'll have to settle for 5. If you don't have this album, what are you waiting for?"
1,Smokehouse' worst recorded CD,"From my subjective point of view, so is this CD a pale version compared to the others released from the Smokehouse."
3,"Works fine, look cheap.",...what a like the must is the memory keep insite....lo que mas me gusta es que la memoria se mantiene dentro.
1,"Don't buy this, it was DOA (dead on arrival)","I bought this to transfer images quickly off of my camera but this piece of garbage was DOA. I opened it a little while after I bought it so I am too late to return it to Amazon and if I were to have Kingston repair it, I have to pay for the return shipping which basically is not worth it. Save your money and get a Sandisk one. I have never had problems with their devices."
5,Multiple Used Item,I'm very glad with this product and with the performance and multiple things I can do with it. Sincerely it was an excellent product and of course an excellent purchase.Thanks you veru much.Enrique Castro.PS. Saome clue for bigger SD Cards (ie: 4GB)?
4,Thomas VHS tape,The video was in good shape as advertised and my grandchildren were thrilled with it.
3,"OK, but short lifespan","I received two of these as gifts. Each one lasted only about 1.5 years of use as an alarm clock before the buttons died. On one, the power button doesn't work at all so I have to unplug it to turn it off. On the other, the alarm setting buttons are inaccurate and alter different settings than intended. This clock is OK for short life (dorm, etc) but don't count on it to last."
2,Fantastic. . . until it broke,"I bought the iHome IH5 Clock Radio about 9 months ago. Up until now it has been a wonderful thing to have. I loved being able to listen to my own music while waking up. The remote control allowed me to adjust the volume, skip songs, hit the snooze button, or turn it off and on all from the comfort of my warm bed. But the dial for adjusting the alarm clock has stopped working. Further, the remote control works only some of the time. So now it's pretty much worthless to me. If it had never broken, I would give it a 4 or 5 star rating, but since it broke after only 9 months I give it 2 stars."
3,If I knew then what I know now!!,"First of all...the sound quality is great and I love the whole concept of waking to your favorite song. That being said....the gradual wake up alarm is a joke. It goes from a level 0...no sound to level 19..loud, in less than 30 seconds. If you're like me and like to gradually wake up to music...don't buy it. The buzzer is also really loud. The display is overly bright even at the lowest setting. I just saw that Sharper Image is coming out with their own version and also includes a sound soother system...over 20 sounds to choose from. I think I might check it out. When I talked to the manager at the I Pod store he said they had numerous complaints about the alarm volumne level. Why don't they just say it's a mistake and fix it??"
1,This item stinks- Literally,"I have the black model. The housing appears to be plasticized vinyl, but what ever it is the thing has a noxious odor. I'm not one to be sensitive to chemical or plastic smells, but this thing reeks! Not the kind of thing you want close to you while you're sleeping."
4,this thing kicks ass,verry nice... I realy like this aside frome being an i-pod player it's a grate radio. I listen to am mostly (KFI am 640). and it's nice that it comes with an am antena... anyways... the sound in this thing is grate.. also I think I only paid $63 for this... hehehe.... bcz I got $20 off of the cost for signing up for an amazon chas card and there was no tax and no shiping... ;-)
5,ihome clock radio,"This is exactly what my son wanted, the price was better than anywhere, daughter now wants one. The sound is really good!"
5,BEST DARN DOCK and they give you a radio...,Great dock; very good clock radio; solid sound. Best value out there.
2,Good concept that loses in practical use...,"I anxiously awaited the delivery of this clock radio so that I could both charge and use my iPod at the same time. I read a review about the brightness of the display and promptly minimized the significance of this problem. Don't make the same mistake. It is blindingly bright. Perhaps the designers don't sleep or didn't put it to a real test in their own home. Other irritating issues include: 1) the buttons on the clock, although nicely lit and legible at night, make the noisest clicking sound, 2) the alarm doesn't smoothly increase in volume--it hits you like a defribulator, 3) it has one of the worst AM reception qualites of any radio that I have owned and 4) the power cord is slightly to short. I emailed the company about these issues but never received a response--to busy?...to apathetic? Save your money. I went back to my Bose and simply used a AUX cable to reach the same effect except without the charging ability...I am okay, now!"
2,"Great sound, but poor durability","I bought this iPod Accessorie about 3 months ago and it already started to fail the dock connection to the iPod, sometimes it only charges, others music and charge and others, simply nothing.My biggest problem is that i live in Chile, so i have no chance to send it back to the USA to validate the warranty."
1,Waste of money,I bought my first Ihome years ago. Within a year the metal piece that connects to the base of the ipod broke. Its very loosely connected to the circuit board. I made a mistake of buying another one. Within another year it stopped connected to any ipod. The buttons rarely work. I have to push the buttons about 20 times to get them to function. The volume wheel makes the volume go up and down while turning it in one direction. Usually I have to play with the wheel to get it to the desired volume as it shuffles back and forth. It rarely picks up radio stations and the sound is poor. I have nothing positive to say about the Ihome.
3,"Disappointed, but Happy because...","I got this for Christmas, and returned it immediately because of a faulty speaker (buzzed). I wasn't all that pleased with the sound or the AM/FM reception either. The only things going for it were the aesthetics and the alarm clock features.Frankly, I wanted performance, and I didn't need an alarm clock. If you want good AM/FM reception, a dedicated iPod docking port, and very good sound, then do what I did - get the TEAC GR-10i. Not only does the audio sound clear without any buzzing or static, it also has deep bass. I'd say the TEAC is as good as the $300 units out there, but at 1/2 to 1/3 the cost. However, it's not really an alarm clock - it doesn't even have a snooze button. Another warning is its size - it's 1/3 larger than the iHome. But it does come with a sturdy little remote."
5,best speaker system available!!!!,I got this today and every part of it is amazing.Radio- The radio quality is better than very many radios.Ipod Quality- Just as good as CD quality... If not better.feautures- The backlight can replace your clock and the three different dims of the light are a nice touch. The buttons also glow for night use.Overall- A solid speaker system. If you dont have ipod speakers... this is definetley the one to get!
1,Look elsewhere,"Our iHome is now just a clock radio as the ipod dock has a short in it after about 7-8 months of (infrequent) use. Had this issue not occurred, I would have given it 3+ stars as it is functional, but sound quality is a little lacking and the remote has very limited distance."
5,Great clock radio,I purchased this last year with the iPod Nanos for my teenage daughters. They use it everyday and often move it from the bedroom to the bathroom to play music during showers. We have had zero problems with it and we have used several different iPod devices and all have worked flawlessly.
2,Get a Sony,These break after a year or two. My other older players still going strong. Disappointing because they are easy to set up.
2,worked for a few months,"This clock was pretty well conceived in design, with a few quirks. It will charge your iPod until it is full, then stop charging. If you leave it for a couple of days, the iPod battery is dead. The buttons have gradually become unresponsive, forcing you to push them until you find their ""sweet spot"" in order to function. The dial controls for the time setting and volume also seem to have deteriorated over the last few months, requiring a lot of patience when attempting to set the alarm, clockwise turning advances the time forward until you almost reach your setting, then ""boom"" it starts turning backward..very frustrating. The clock worked for the first few months and then these problems started. Now I'm looking for a new clock radio."
1,Bad product.,"I ordered this for my son's bedroom, but was not pleased to find that the clock didn't light up like it was supposed to. It appears that the backlight is busted so unless it is day time or I have the light on in the room, I can't see the clock."
3,It's okay,"I was really excited to get this product and found it relatively easy to set up and all of that. I use it mostly for the alarm feature at this point, however I can't stand the gradual volume. It goes up very quickly and defeats the purpose of gentle waking you up. THere is also no option to change this feature to just a regular volume and not gradual. This is my only complaint, otherwise I think it is a great boombox for the ipod."
5,Great way to wake up,"I love my clock radio. I have a wake up play list and it gets me started with my favorite music. Sound is terrific. Not tinny like so many of the players in this price range can be. I love the fact that it's also my charger every night for my Ipod, so I never have to remember to plug it in to charge it because I know I'm going to put it on my radio every night."
4,"Good unit, albeit a bit pricey (pricy?)","I've owned the iHome for about 3 weeks now. I have a regular 20G iPod and the iHome is a good solid unit for my bedroom. The sound is good, although I wish I could change the treble/bass (for this price I think this should have been included). I can rock the bedroom and can even hear it well when I'm in the next room on the treadmill. The unit does have a fairly large footprint on my nightstand. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and won't upgrade to something else until this puppy burns out."
2,Slowly failing after one year,"At first I tried this on my nightstand, but even at its lowest setting, it was much too bright. So we put it in our kitchen, where it looks nice on the counter. However . . .After a year of use, the display is starting to go out -- the light is much dimmer on one side than the other . . .And worse, it loses about five minutes a week. I really never expected a digital clock to lose a significant amount of time, but the iHome does. I'm just about to dump it. There are better choices out there, folks."
3,Good not great,"Cons:This clock worked well for about 6 months THEN the circlular scrolling buttons stopped working well. They would move in random directions when you scrolled left or right. (i.e. to change time or volume) and NO I was not hard on them, I take care of my stuff.Also the remote is just about as close as you get to being a joke. Hardly works.Pros:But this clock really looks nice and sounds fantasticI got this for 40$ with free shipping, so I'm still happy with it :)"
4,ihome is much better than most,"i bought the ihome iH5 for my 16 year old daughter to use with her ipod nano. i had purchased and returned 3 other similar competitors products because they had lots of static and constant humming sound at all volume levels. however, the iH5 sounds amazing- absolutely no static or hum- just good clean, full, rich sound. the iH5 does not have tone control- not a problem with the ipod since it has it's own set of tone controls. if you're looking for a decent sounding clock radio/ ipod player for around $75, look no further."
2,"lousy, if this is same as hotel hih66w model...","What a piece of junk! Staying at a hotel, I have one of these. First, I had to unplug and remove the batteries to get it to reboot -- it was locked up and wouldn't respond. Then it had the wrong time on it so I had to google this model to find the user manual. Then I find out I had to open a secret compartment on the back to set the time. Then I had to turn the round dial numerous times to get to the right setting. What a pain!"
2,So-so,"I bought the iHome so that I could choose which songs to wake up to off of my iPod, and it worked well when it actually WORKED.After being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off I tossed the item - it wasn't worth all of the problems to keep at all if I couldn't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning.Other people have mentioned the too bright display and the ""gradual volume increase"", which I eventually got used to, but I could see how they would be incredibly annoying."
4,i am happy with it,"I did some research into buying an ipod speakers. First i thought of buying Bose though its expensive, then i dropped that idea mainly becuase its overpriced with less features. This one fits the bill perfectly. I am not a sound expert but this is not bad at all. If you dont see it, it sounds like music is coming from a bigger system.I bought mine from costco, it is version 2 with some enhancements. It also include a cute remote. This is a must. This is not just an alarm for me :). it plays my 5g ipod, FM , AM and line-in form my laptop. Line-in does not play while ipod is docked."
1,Design flaw kills this product,"The design flaws have been covered by other reviewers, this is just another review to help drive the point home about how poorly designed this unit really is. It is truly insane the architects behind this unit thought every person in the world prefers to be waken up at full volume. My wife, who bought this unit for me for my birthday, begged me to return it with no hard feelings on her part, just make the stupid thing stop playing! And be sure you really grasp how bright the lcd display is on this thing. There's two settings: 747 landing strip, and the dimmer setting, Lear jet landing strip. I put a fat book in front of the display so I can go to sleep at night. Wait until they redesign the unit and fix the flaws. I'm sure the next version of this design will be pretty good."
2,STOP right there,"Don't do it... You can get a generic boom-box with way better sound and speakers. (and a cd player) for much less money, just look for one with an aux input jack, get the cable ($5.00 at radio shack) and you are done.This unit is not much in the sound quality dept."
3,A Bit Short on Extreme Islamic Views,"I like the idea of sort of a summary of the major religions. It is pretty informative. Unfortunately, no mention is made of the Wahabi movement in Islam which is responsible for at least some of the terrorism attributed to the midle east region. While I agree with the author that the vast majority of Muslims view their faith peacefully readers need to know what is expected under the most extreme practices and the relationship of those practices with the law in an Islamic nation ruled by the law of Sharia."
3,Low Impact reading - Light and Airy,"DeCaro pulled me in with his autobiographical premise, and I never thought twice about not finishing the book. However, I had higher hopes and thought his words might challenge my thinking a bit more than they did. There were few surprises in DeCaro's recollections - just some relatively light humor amidst touches of childhood angst. Easy and pleasant enough to read."
3,"Works as advertised, but...","Data Becker has created a fine product that actually does what it says it does. Based on samples on ones handwriting, it creates a TrueType font suitable for use in any documents created on a Windows or other TT-compatible computer. I have downgraded the product, however, because it's copy-protected. Not just copy-protected, but using C-Dilla, one of the more obnoxious copy-protection schemes in existence. Of course, there is no mention of that until the install routine actually installs C-Dilla on the PC, after which it's a major nightmare removing the ""curse"" should one desire to later. I don't have a problem with software publishers protecting their property, but this is major overkill for a $20 program. Had I known ahead of time that C-Dilla was used, I'd never have bought it, despite its excellent performance."
4,True to life,"This book was a true snapshot of life in the rat race of urban L.A. I recommend this book. Unpredicatable....yes, funny...yes, but most of all - sad; and an alarm for those to get their life together. This story is told somewhat difference from the normalcy and I truly enjoyed reading it."
4,a real message - don't sleep on it!,"I don't claim to be a true book critic or reviewer, but I know good reading when I find the time to read. The last bad decision was oh too real no matter where you are from and no matter what age you are. I would agree with the reviewer who didn't like the ending being first. To each its own, but me personally I like suspense myself and being told that Chancey died in the first chapter spoiled it but only to a certain extent. The writing in this book was good enough to still keep me wondering and wanting to know how he died or if he even died at all. I was think maybe the author was trying to throw us off. Sad to say he really did die and I hated the feeling it left me with. Paula Edwards's writing style hits hard enough to ""MAKE"" you feel it. If we don't see a change in our mothers and troubled teens, the last bad decision will be timeless! And, If you not feeling this one what world are you living in?"
1,Maybe its just me,"IM all for hood books but maybe it was just me but i could not get past 115, i feel like it is taking too long to get to the action or the point, i lost interest. i read a reviewer on here comment and i must agree it has not caught my attention and i am all for hood books i own or have a vast majority of them but this one is not hittin it right now. if possible somebody persuade me i should continue but right now im not feeling it and i quit trying to figure it out."
2,If you don't like my review...,"THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE I WAS A FAN OF EDWARDS' BOOK THE LAST BAD DECISION, BUT I AM NOT A FAN OF HER! I MET HER AND HER ATTITUDE WAS DRY AND UNCARING. I TOOK HER STANDOFF PERSONALITY PERSONAL SINCE I READ HER BOOK MORE THAN ONCE. I LIKED THE WAY SHE INTRODUCED THE CHARACTERS AND MADE THEM ALL STAND OUT AND HAVE THEIR OWN IDENTIES AND LIKED THE STORY LINE AND THE UNEXPECTED ENDING, BUT EDWARDS HERSELF, I COULD DO WITHOUT! BELIEVE ME MY REVIEW IS NOT BASED ON JEALOUSY OR NOTHING LIKE THAT. I THINK SHE IS A TALENTED WRITER WITH SOME GOOD STORIES BUT LIKE THE SAYING GOES CELEBERTIES ARE NOTHING WITHOUT THE FANS!!!!!"
3,Too Sad for 5 Stars,"I'm not taking anything from this book, so don't get me wrong. It was a good read - I read it in 2 days. However, I hate tragic endings. I was hoping for something better for our lovely Chancey Walker. The writer really throws this character in your face and MAKES you fall in love with him right before she yanks him from you. The feeling wasn't good at all. Other than that, the scenes we painted well, the characters were well thought of before written about, and the book was filled with DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA! I liked that. If you're a drama queen or king (Men are full of drama, too. Don't be fooled), and you have a flare for unpredictable endings, pick this book up. You won't be disappointed. PEACE YAW!"
2,David Gray Wannabe,"Not that that's a bad thing. David Gray happens to be a personal fave of mine. I bought this cd for the song Untold, having heard a brief snippet of it on a tv show. I need to give it more play, I'm sure, to find all the nuances that other reviewers here seem to have found on this cd. So far, I'm not feeling it."
2,Huh?,"This product doesn't make any sense to me. I've used numerous back and muscle related products and they all do something useful. This one - not so much.One major problem with it is that it is made for you to 'lie' on, but it isn't strong enough to actually put any serious weight on (and I'm not a big person, just regular size). I think if it were really solid and held it's shape under weight, maybe it would work, but absent that, it is marginal and there are much better (and cheaper!) alternatives."
3,Product manual would be useful,"I purchased this as a recommendation from my chiropractor.A couple of issues -1. I ordered a soft Da Vinci Tool, but a hard one arrived. Not a problem, I was happy to try something firmer.2. There is no instruction manual. It has 3 sides and sold as trigger point therapy for the whole body but I just can't figure it out.The only area I use this for is my occipital area. Gives tremendous relief."
3,It's okay,"This device is okay. It doesn't seem to do anything for me. Perhaps I'm using it wrong. I wouldn't know, I'm not a physical therapist. It would be nice if it came with instructions."
2,Hit or miss,"This product looks like a hit or miss depending on your injury. I have shoulder/neck pain and found this product to be too firm and too limiting. I can see where it could help others but for me, it is a door stop now."
1,Nothing special,"Tried it once, didn't like it, never tried it again. The same day, I also ordered the Back Buddy Cane. THAT, I can't live without."
4,The BIGS is choice!,"I think this game is great- it's fun and easy. I also have MLB 2K8, but this game is slightly more enjoyable because of it's arcade feel."
4,Great! Wait a mintue...,"So I bought the Reflections [Vinyl] edition, and it came well packaged and in a timely manner. However, when I opened it, instead of seeing the blue version like the picture, and the sound track like the one in the description, I had a tan/beige cover with a shorter track list. After inspecting it, I realized I have received the special edition. It is sealed, and in excellent condition (no bent corners, no runs in plastic seal) but is not what was advertised. As this is a present for someone else, it is yet to be determined whether this is a great surprise or a bad mistake.****Update****As hoped, the present turned out to be a great surprise. The person receiving the present had neither edition and was excited to have the vinyl of such a great artist. Thanks!"
1,very unsatisfied with product,"i have written several times requesting to return the merchandise. i received a the CD reflections by Paul Van Dyk, and it is a double disc set. well, i received two number 2 discs and not number one. the reason i decided to purchase this CD is because of the music contained on disc number 1. i have yet to receive any thing from media crazy. all i asked for was the disc number 1 to be sent to me. i did not want my money, but i have not received anything from them. now, i do want my money back."
3,Sales pitch for PSP and TSP,This book by Watts S. Humphrey has an appealing title and actually an interesting set of chapters. However the book quickly falls in a sales pitch for Humphrey's Personal Software Process (PSP) and Team Software Process (TSP). If winning with software is indeed all about selling and applying PSP and TSP then the book is on track and will give champions a few tips and some data on how to sell these methodologies to their senior management.
5,A Real Winner,"This is my new favorite appliance. Aside form the great way it cooks, it is so easy to clean. I recommend this to anyone."
5,Adorable book,"My 11 month old Grandson loves the DK Pop-Up books. They are colorful and the pop-ups are very sturdy. He has the DK Peekaboo Farm and Peekaboo Playtime books. (With the third DK pop-up book on pre-order for March) These are his favorite books.. He wants to read them over and over and over again. He smiles and laughs at the turn of each page, and eagerly reaches to pull down the pop-ups himself. I highly reccomend them!"
2,WHAT?!?!?!?!,"I didnt like it. And I usually like movies that are psychological. It was just disturbing seeing animals decapitate. SPOILER And why would someone want their leg taken off to be symmetrical? Just a weird movie. I thought some of it was okay, but overall I didnt like it. I am a film student so I had to watch this movie for film class, besides that I would have probably never watched it."
1,Pass the sawdust please,"Greenaway is one of the most intellectually tedious filmmakers I've ever encountered and one of the most pretentious. But I think he's outdone himself with this insular muddle of a film. A Zed And Two Noughts is perhaps his most self-reflexive, self-contained and self-absorbed work with nary a character (or anything else for that matter) capable of eliciting a response from me, emotional or otherwise despite the constant visual references to the paintings of Vermeer. The air of emotional detachment is palpable in large part because this movie hermetically exists in its own bubble, in love with its own artifice, and relative to little else but itself. Its also one of the most bloodless (ironically enough considering its concern with death and decay), and least engaging films I've ever seen. I can only compare watching it to the joy of eating dry white toast while studying integrated circuit diagrams."
2,terrible journalism,"Full of errors. You wonder if the author did any basic reporting himself or just re-wrote random news stories. Plus, what's with all the cliches?"
2,Disastrous quality for a film of genius,"This is a wonderful film, but it is incomprehensible how a seller could even wish their name their name to be associated, even remotely, with a quality that is so far from honest or reasonable. A travesty.I own the LaserDisc version and live in HK. I have seen poor quality Chinese Video CDs - 1990s technology. They are better.Every scene in which there is any fast movement or action degenerates into a set of poorly resolved blocks of digital noise. And this in a black and white film.I could do far better myself.The engineering of the transfers is incompetent.This should not be on sale.Perhaps the Coppolas will reissue their version, weak though it is, to avoid it being sucked down by this Korean failure."
2,"For $5 it was fine, but wouldn't renew again","Not my sort of magazine. Always heard about it from Project Runway but wasn't that impressed with the overall magazine. Glad it was only $5, but will not be renewing ever again."
5,good magazine,Im a tad bit older than the generation the publisher is aiming at so its not really for me but then im 52. If you 25-40 might be for u.
1,Eileen,"Magazine has pictures which is the only good thing about it. Also the November2010 issue had an article that included a piece on Dana Perino. She ison Fox News often and Elle Magazine had to make a make a sleezy commentabout Fox News in the article about Dana. Elle, stick to fashion whichyou do a lousey job with and stay away from politics. Another junkpublication by the liberal media. I've cancelled my subscription!"
3,prescription not arriving on time,You need to wait for a month for your 1st prescription to arrive. Although Amazon said it should start in September but my first issue was actually the Oct issue. I ordered Cosmo and Glamor at the same time but the other two magazines have been coming on time unlike Elle.
3,Have seen better,"I bought this lcd in gray. Thought it's gona be a fine monitor for digital imaging. It came with one defective pixel. The warranty does not cover the repairing of that. Only if there's more than four bad pixels. Redicolous. It's a nightmare to look on the monitor every time you peer on it, you see that little pixel vibrating in your eyes at almost the center of the screen.I don't know how can Sony let such crap out of their factory. I'm sure they testing them, but then why don't they repaire it.Otherwise i've seen better lcd-s. Over all i was not facinated by the colors, contrast, it's not better than avrage. The coated screen still doesn't help if you wiew it from angles. Colours vary upon the angle you view the monitor. Those who are a bit serious about their monitors, still should by a good crt, or a viewsonic lcd, instead of that. Don't let the nice design and the famous brand cheat you, it still just a monitor."
2,Too late Shipping and Product is damaged,"I have ordered two products in same day; one of them which is from another sender, I got four days before this product. Excluding labor day, product has taken 7 days to be delivered. Monitor is damaged hopefully not the screen but the around has noticeable scratches.The positive side is product was very cheap; reason of not given 1 star.Thank you."
1,WORST GAME FOR DS!,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME IT IS STUPID AND BADLY MADE. For one thing there are more glitches than you can even count and the controls are horrible and confusing. Let me just give you an example of the controls, now in most games if you press the up arrow it should make you go up, but in this game you go sideways. I absolutely hate this game. If you are wise you will not get this game."
1,this game sucks,i can't believe how crappy this game is. they make it way too hard and the graphics suck. It is also very hard to see. it seems there is no light on at all.Do Not Buy This Game!!!!!
3,This is a great game.,"If you have ever played Rayman 2 on the Nintendo 64, this is the same game, only on your Nintendo DS. This game is not for the casual gamer though, it can get very hard and there are long distances between check points. So if you die you got to go back to the last checkpoint. But on the plus side you get tons and tons of trys to beat the level. I would recomend this game to the hardcore gamer. The reason this game only got a 3 for overall is because the graphics are not the best in the world, and the audio is quite. But all that matters for a game is that it is fun."
2,Sorry but...,"This game got a lot of great reviews so I bought it for my children ranging from 7-12 yrs. old and they all said it was a really hard game and could barely get past the first couple of levels...and there are no save points through the level so it makes it extra difficult, Game has been sitting on the shelf now since the second day we got it."
2,"Rayman 2, but broken","It's a port of Rayman 2. The masterpiece just doesn't work on DS.The controls aren't bad, but moving is the huge pain. You can only go in four directions at first, then you can turn.Another problem is the camera. It can trick you into going the wrong way, which it did to me many times.The graphics kind of die in the DS version and make many flaws. Plus the original soundtrack isn't there...Not a bad game, but too many flaws."
4,Fun with one frustrating element,"When Rayman uses the flying walking shell, you crash all the time. You can't avoid it, as it's the only way to get to the next 'place'. I haven't been able to master it yet so I'm stuck - this is the only frustrating bit, I enjoy the rest...so, until I figure it out I can only give a four star rating. I have to say that the underwater places are fantastic."
2,Very disappointing,I was very disappointed when reading this novel. The characters seem to be very shallow in comparison to the Legion novels and even the follow on Krispos and Time of Trouble novels. The type of dialogue between the characters is stiff. The author needs to re-read his Legion novels and get back to that style of writing.
4,Good Value,"Its six pairs of toe seperators. We ordered them for our daughter's birthday party, it had a spa theme. They unfortunatly arrived the day after the party. Still we used them for our daughters. A good price for what they are."
3,Too hard,It would be nice if the material they are made of would be more pliable. The spacers hurt my toes.
1,college student's worst nightmare,"First bad thing-they sent me the completely WRONG textbook. They responded to my email the day after I complained about it and told me they sent the correct textbook with express shipping because I said I had a test and needed the book as soon as possible. 5 days later, I got the right textbook and they had sent it standard shipping and made no attempt to get it to me faster than a regular order. I won't order from them again."
2,"Not her best, or even close","The sad thing is, I am a major Andre Norton fan, and I didn't enjoy this book very much. I trudged through it out of loyalty, but I sure don't recommend it.The triplets take turns talking, which would be fine if in any way Norton had given them ""different voices"". Unlike, say, Terry Goodkind, who can have many characters voice and they are all truly unique, the triplets have nothing distinguishing them. Therefore its distracting, too much going on, and frankly you just don't much care. The strange man they meet has so little of him that , well.. its just a poorly written book and quite a disappointment."
1,"Way, Way over priced","I was going to return these as they are very poor quality, but the kids found them and love them. I don't think they will last the evening and the price is horrendous for the product."
3,Misleading Title,"This book probably should have been called, ""Random Musings of Yeats."" There is a little regional folklore recorded here, mostly from areas near where Yeats grew up, but it mostly pertains to events that have happened in the last couple generations, rather than being very old stories passed down over centuries. Yeats records a couple of his own trance experiences where he percieves faeries. But there are also entries about God and Christianity that are sometimes purely the author's own reflections and a couple entries about beautiful women as remembered by men who knew them, which have little to nothing to do with Celtic folklore. It reads more like a writer's journal of loosely related inspirational sources, than an anthology of folklore from circa 1900, which is what I was expecting. If you just like Yeats and are curious about the author's mind and spiritual beliefs, you might like this book. If you're doing research into Irish folklore, it's not very helpful."
1,worst book i've ever read!,"This was probably the worst book i have ever read. it's shockingly bad. in fact, it is the only book i have ever thrown away after reading. The only value this book brought me is that it at least took me in the mindset of a man who lived before i was born and i enjoyed some of the old terminology that was used. But i can pretty much sum up every chapter for you as: i ran into a peasant today and he told me he saw a fairy once...end of chapter. none of the stories build on each other and they are all short with not much meaning behind them. Don't waste your hard earn money on this book. I understand WB Yeates to be one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, but i was not impressed. I will continue to search for a good book to read about Irish myths and folklore, but i highly recommend for those new and interested in Norse mythology to read: Children of Odin by Padriac Colum."
1,Overpriced for what it is - Very Hard to Learn,"O.K. I bought this some months ago on a colleague's recommendation. After a few DAYS of going through and trying to create a site I had a mediocre, confusing bunch of mish-mash. So I went back to square one for a few MORE DAYS. This software is really not for visual thinkers. If you are an artist or creative type - Dreamweaver's not for us. After a couple of weeks I tried FrontPage - it's worse.I finally found a more visual and intuitive program called Net Objects Fusion 7, which I also have reviewed.If you want to look at and learn complicated code without really seeing what's happening Dreamweaver is for you. For the more creative or artistic types or if you don't want to learn all the complex code I would recommend NetObjects Fusion 7. It's by far the best of the 4 programs I have used.I suppose each has their strengths - Dreamweaver has alot of features but they are useless if it takes forever to learn to use them. That's time I don't have."
5,You can tell men from boys by the price of their toys...,"Used them all. Frontpage is an easy tool to use and can be extended as far as you would reasonably want to go with easy-to-use third-party add-ons. DW MX and DW MX Studio start at one or two levels above Frontpage and, therefore, have a steeper start-up learning curve and can reach ""higher altitudes"".MX Studio is the finest package of software (WYSIWIG or not) I have had my hands on in over 30 years of bit-banging. With MX Studio, you can bring your coffee pot and ""move in"". Your whole computer is accessible from within DW MX. And armed with 4 more specialized development packages in the Studio to round out the product, DW MX Studio will stimulate your creative juices once you are ""settled in"".The Studio is aimed at the professional or the cyber-hobbyist.If you've got the spare change and the need to do it all, your choice is DW MX Studio. ""Go for broke!"""
3,extremely cool and not cool at the same time,"the cool thing about dreamweaver mx is that it takes full advantage of the top-notch text editor HomeSite (HomeSite is no longer available from Macromedia). dreamweaver mx is perfect for those who do both front-end web design and back-end coding.BUT that's not most web designers or web developers. and therein lies the problem.if you're a web developer, you don't need the memory overhead that a WSYWYG editor requires. you only need a text editor with some syntax highlighting.similarly, if you're a designer who is using dreamweaver for layout and prototype development, whether or not your editor allows you to nifty things with PHP and ASP isn't that important.and this sucker is very much a resources hog. granted, i have an older computer (733mhz, pIII with 384MB ram), but i was able to run dreamweaver 3 at the same time as image editing software and a web server with out nearly as much slowdown.i'm not sure if it's worth the upgrade."
4,Great Purchase,I was happy with the purchase. The book arrived very quickly and was in good condition. I would definitely buy another product from seller. Thanks!!
5,Invaluable historical/theological document,"Whether you agree or disagree with its message--I for the most part disagree--it's impossible to ignore the significance of HUMANAE VITAE in the history of the Roman Catholic Church. Its proponents see it as an reaffirmation of the Church's ages old comittment to the sanctity of human life. Its detractors see it as a rebuke of the principals set forth in Vatican II, and a step backwards in the evolution of the Church as a viable modern religion."
2,"Very interesting, but somewhat gimmicky","Beware! This book is not for helping you change your habits over the long-term, but it interesting because it gives you a range of options should you need to lose weight quickly. And I MEAN WEIGHT, not NECESSARILY FAT. In fact, you will probably just lose a lot of water and the glycogen stored in your muscles, instead of actual FAT. It is pretty much physically impossible to lose 5 pounds a week unless you are morbidly obese and totally starving, which is not healthy, nor is it realistic over the long term. But ""Dr."" -- and that's Ph.D., not M.D.--Perrone gets 2 stars from me for the effort!"
5,Great blocks,"I bought these for our church nursery and the kids love them!! They are soft and easily stackable and you can't go wrong buying these. Some people complained of smell, but I didn't notice any."
4,I think this worked,"I bought this a long time ago for a 450 GT helicopter. I think I needed it for a battery connection.It worked, but, it's cheaply made."
1,Hatari,Received the item and tried to play it. Something came on the screen saying that it was in the wrong region so I couldn't play it. Sending it back would just cost more money so I'm done with Amazon for now.
1,"We ordered the movie, Hatari with John Wayne. On the order it stated we would get the DVD as well as one we could watch online.",We only recieved a DVD and it will not show on our DVD at all. I lost the return address but I was under the impression it was ordered from Amazon.com. What do we do with this?
1,Disappointed,The DVD will not play. The product appears to be new but displays an on screen code or mesasage stating that it will not play on multiple players.
5,Hatari,John Wayne is the best of the best. Anything he does is good for me to watch. I don't have qualms about letting my grandson watch his movies.
1,Not Good Business,"I would have liked to have known, when I first purchased these 2 video's, that they couldn't even be watched in the area where I live, and I'm not moving to Europe just to see them.I believe the seller should have given this information out in the very beginning, but did not. Now I have the hassle of returning them and trying to get the mess straightened out. I won't be ordering from them again.I love ordering item's from Amazon, but when I see this other name come up on my search for dvd's, it will be a red flag for me!"
1,Hatari,This item took over 1.5 months to receive and when I finally got it it would not play in any of my DVD players. Aparently this movie is formatted for another country. Completely dissapointed.
5,Hatari,"This is a Wayne movie that has never gotton alot of attetion,,there is some great actors in it and the scenery of Africa and the animals are cool.It as it all and any Wayne fan that hasnt seen this is missing out."
5,Delightful!,"My husband and I both really enjoyed this book (i.e. it will appeal to both men and women). It's a nice change of pace from the same-old, same-old. Great characters and an episodic plot as incredible, quick-paced, and satisfying as the pulp comics that Franklin gets his start in. Good and evil are pretty black and white here, but Christopher's ultimate outlook on life seems as sunny as Franklin's yellow fedora."
2,Could have been so much better,"Having just visited the Clew Bay area of County Mayo, I bought this book hoping for an interesting read about the life of Grace O'Malley and was sorely disappointed. The book is about 5% Grace and 95% general Irish history of the era, which, while important, makes for very dry reading at times. Furthermore, the book suffers from occasional mangled grammar and glaring factual errors, for example, referring to two men once as being uncle-nephew and later as being step-brothers. Although several people in the narrative do have the same name, this kind of mistake is inexcusable if a competent editor had been on board.Furthermore, the index is woefully incomplete and the one supplied map is not very helpful. There is no scale -- a cardinal sin when printing any map -- and many places and castles mentioned in the book are not on the map at all; their inclusion would have added a lot to my comprehension.Sail past this book if you want a lively read about Grace O'Malley."
5,This book is a must for visiting Michigan lighthouses.,"Prior to a vacation to the great state of Michigan in search of lighthouses, we purchased this book from Amazon. It was THE BEST tour guide! The directions were invaluable and the history behind each of these beautiful lights was a bonus. I would definitely recommend this book if taking a trip to visit the lights of the Great Lakes."
1,Not like the picture,"I ordered this for my wife and when we received it was not as pictured. The blister pack looks just like the above picture, but when we actually got the case out of the box, it opened like a star trek communicator and not like a book (as it is pictured). Luckily Amazon took it back."
2,This is a toy,Great idea for a gift for a youth. I wanted this unit to locate metal property markers and was very diasappointed in this product. I was unable to find the markers with this product and gave it to my grandchildren to play with. Ended up going to the sporting goods store and buying a different unit for a few extra dollars and it worked great. If you want something to use for a hobby spend a few extra bucks and buy a better unit.
5,Nice metal detector,"It's pretty good at locating metals in the ground and it has the trash eliminator so that you can focus more on precious metals and weed out junk. Easy to use, still is gonna take time to recognize the difference in beeps from it but I'm getting there"
5,Great Fun!,"I am a nanny for a special needs 4 yr old. It is very difficult for him to stay on task while being read to, but...this one keeps his attention every time. He loves it when I ask him if the trash truck is full yet, and he is starting to chant along with me..........a big accomplishment for someone who has been in speech therapy his whole life! We love this book and plan to share a copy with his speech therapist!"
1,Not True To Size Stated on Amazon Website,"This is a nice lightweight pan, but I was looking for a bundt pan 10.5"" x 10.5"" x 3.5"". Instead I received a pan 9.5"" x 9.5"" x 3.25"". It holds a lot less than the pan I've had for years and I was looking for another the same size. Perhaps they shipped the wrong item? I'm afraid I'll have to return it. Hopefully Amazon will correct the dimensions listed on their website."
3,"If You Want The Book With The Least Detail, This Is It.","This book is thin with lots of colorful pictures of mice, some of the things you need and can have when you own a mouse and a few pictures of the subject they're talking about at the time. Example: How to figure out what gender your mouse is.It also includes a VERY nice couple of pages that show you a picture of a healthy mouse and has arrows pointing at the signs of a healthy mouse like clear eyes and shiny fur.It's not a complete guide to owning a mouse, but it's short and to the point. It's a good guide to get for people that don't like to read more than 30 pages."
4,Good introduction to painting,My son and his daughter painted these two pictures together. That is a good way to do it if it is the first paint by number. It had enough detail that Middle School kids would enjoy it.
2,Get the original,"The major difference between the original and version II is that the author and his followers have turned the subject matter into a kind of religion in version II. Like all religions, it needs to have many layers and become more mysterious and require interpretation from its clergy. Feh. The first book was clear and to the point. This new and improved version is needlessly complex and bulky. Mr. Kiersey, next time, just change the color of the cover and use bigger type font if you need more pages. I rate the original with 4.5 stars...this version gets a 2."
3,Far Too General,"I read this book concurrently with Type Talk at Work and found this book impractical. The generalizations that Keirsey makes with personality types seem absurd, as if filling pages with a multitude of vocations that might intersect with a given personality trait would be helpful. I was looking for a practical book that I could use to stimulate discussion with my staff at work and this book did not fill that need. I'm not entirely sure what need it does fill."
4,Textbook for UCSB's Comm 191 Comm Internship course,"Interesting; helps you realize aspects of yourself such as attitude, actions, thought process, etc. Great for guiding an individual on what to do w/their lives career-wise."
3,"By the Expert, but Hard to Read","You gotta have it if you want to understand the MBTI, but good luck getting through it! Keirsey gives a disclaimer that is true- he is a bit obtuse.It's good information that needs to get out there, but it'd be nice if it was re-written by someone who knows how to write a page-turner!"
3,An improvement,"For simple coverage of a complex subject, this book is a worthwhile improvement over its predecessor. I find the over-simplifications a little annoying; however, if you don't want or need solid research and if you want a simple introduction to personality type theory, this is good. Then move on to Jung (with the Quenks, Kirby, Kroeger, et al interpreting him with the MBTI) and into the theory and more mature applications."
3,Too many words!,Funny..very funny in parts. The author seems to think his return is based on the number of words. This is unfortunate for the reader.
3,Fun toy however cannot find replacement rockets,"This rocket launcher is a lot of fun, however, by the end of the week both of the rockets had been stepped on and broken. Once they crack, they do not fly very well. I have searched all over for replacement rockets, but cannot find where Air Hogs sells them. Very disappointing! I will be ordering the other system w/the foam rockets so maybe they'll last a bit longer!"
1,Something Is Missing,I have been pleased with the REA books for 2 past CLEPS. This one definitely falls way short. This book only contained about 15-20% of info actually on the CLEP test. I studied this guide and mastered both practice tests. The actual test covered much more than this book did. I am very disappointed.
3,MIGHT NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS CLEP,"I took the Educational Psychology CLEP and passed (52) after I successfully took Intro to Psych CLEP and Human Growth and Development PSYC. I don't think this book would have been sufficient to pass the CLEP test all on it's own. There is a ton of information on the test that were never even mentioned in the book. My recommendation to pass the CLEP would be to take the Human Growth and Development CLEP first and then read this book and take the Educational Psychology CLEP soon after! And if you have a membership to InstaCert, which I didn't, review those flash cards. Good luck!"
1,Variable and failed early,The humidity level rarely seemed to respond as one would expect. More so it stayed the same reading regardless of the environment it was placed in. After only a month of service the meter failed completely. Would not recommend.
2,Not recommended!,"I purchased this about a year or so ago. While I loved the size of the unit, I had problems with it turning itself off intermittently. Finaly about a couple of weeks ago it went completely dead so I replaced it's battery. It had some life for about a day and then quite working again. I am now shopping for a new unit, but I won't be buying this one again!"
3,Pleased/then disappointed,"I was thrilled with the unity candleholder when it arrived as well as the promptness of delivery - The product was nicer than pictured and packaged beautifully, which was an added bonus as it was a shower gift for our daughter. I was disappointed after the wedding, however, as the beautiful finish appears to have been ruined by dripping wax, something I didn't expect from something made to hold candles, particularly from Lenox. The wedding was just recently and I haven't contacted the company to see what the problem/solution may be. I am issuing the review prior to talking to the company because I received an email inviting the review and wanted to do so while I had the link in front of me. I'll try to remember to report what Lenox has to say."
5,Simply irresistible,"Astronaut wife left me with mixed feelings. On one side I wish that the band is succesful with this CD, especially because I cannot wait to hear a second one. On the other side I hesitate because the success might corrupt and commercialize this wonderful blend of synth, amazing vocals and intelligent lyrics that makes the band the absolutely best discovery of the new millenium. Keep it coming guys!"
2,don't waste your money,"I loved the design of this bed and I even enjoyed putting it together, but this bed is made of fiberboard. One of the care instructions states that you must wipe dry immediately, if you spill water on it. If you make a mistake assembling this bed, there is a huge risk of damaging the fiberboard. I broke a piece of the bed, the first time I sat on it. It looks nice, but I don't think it's going to last long."
2,"Bad, not to standard of Korean period drama.","This movie falls way off the mostly high standards of Korean historical period drama.Cinematogragphy is just simply low, low grade; is merely likened to those hastily-produceddaily soap-opera fare. Ditto for costume. Ditto for dialogue/Screenplay. Ditto for the sets/Art DirectionTo all kung-fu sword-fighting aficiondas, you just have to watch ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""and you can immediately see and feel the BIG difference. This movie has a good story-line, butvery sadly let down badly by all the other components of good movie-making."
1,Ick.,"I'm ten, as you can see, and this book appears to be utter fiction. Where did the authors cook up the idea of kids from outer space? If you actually do a good search on the Internet, you can find that auras appear to be of questionable reality and Kirlian photography is most likely fake. Kids _are_ special, but having New Age parents who are convinced their child is an alien won't cut it. If you actually plow through the book, you'll see that the so-called indigo children are regular kids, maybe with ADD or ADHD, who are coddled to an extreme. Emissaries from heaven? This is the stuff of wishers. The basic idea of an indigo child is a kid who is very creative and (if I may say so) demanding and spoiled. How can these writers tell that these behavior patterns have not been seen before? As far as I'm corncerned, this is just some people convincing themselves that their kids are highly evolved, angel's messengers, and oh-so-special."
1,Let's Get Real Man!,After reading this book and reading some of the reviews given here I am amazed! All parents should read this book? All teachers should read this book? Why? To promote the ideas that our children are space aliens? I fear for our children if teachers buy into this stuff! I agree with the reviewer that said this is cultist stuff! Teachers and parents beware!
1,un-good.,"i did not finish this, and did not enjoy or feel in any way enriched or enlightened by the first two chapters that i did read. the end."
5,Good practical stuff here (take or leave the theory part),"I liked this book a lot. I don't necessarily feel that children with the qualities described in this book are new... BUT I do feel that there are a LOT more of them today! I would recommend this book to any parent that wants some practical good ideas on how to care for the young and for anyone that is involved in teaching and working with children in general. There are some specific attitudinal shifts suggested, how to relate, vitamins and minerals etc. It also has some theories on why there seams to be more ""sensitive"" kids these days, which needs a pretty open mind to accept and you can take or leave, (I mostly accept) but everything else in the book on practical application is wonderful and good all by itself. The best way to help the planet has always been the proper nurturing of the next generation that's going to use it."
1,A strange book about children,"I picked this book up because I thought it might tell me something new about dealing with children, especially those with ADD. I was interested because my child has ADD. First, I couldn't figure out what Indigo meant. The articles in this book were very confusing. I think any parent could see their child as an Indigo child. However, as I read more I became shocked. The idea that our children are different because they are space aliens is pretty far out! It seems like the authors are not all here mentally! I realize that everyone is entitled to their beliefs. But let's be up front about it. The advice given on dealing with chldren was also disappointing. I'd recommend a more down to earth book for parents. Don't waste your time here unless you are a follower of this space aliens among us beliefs."
1,Still Waiting,"AS of JUly 5, 2012, I have not received any magazines. I will galdly fill out your survey when I receieve a magazine"
1,"Love the film, but",This is an illegal copy imo. The film is blurry and has a grainy effect all the way through it. When I watche dit on VHS when it was released it didn't look this bad.Very disappointed.
5,Wheatsworth stone ground crackers,"We have enjoyed these crackers for years. No others compare. Publix markets in Palm Beach County,Florida no longer carry these crackers, therefore please correct your website information. Whomever at Kraft/Nabisco that decided to discontinue this product ??? has made a hugh marketing blunder! If this product IS available SOMEPLACE please let me know. We want this product back!"
2,A little stilted for my taste,"Ian Hobson deserves a lot of credit for bringing us a rare glimpse into these greatly under-rated works. I feel guilty only giving him 2 stars for his efforts.But then again he probably should've mastered the works more fully before recording them.The Godowsky Studies are famously difficult; there is no question about that. But Hobson sounds like he is still glued to the score. There are hesitations at the ends of phrases that sound unnatural and take away from the flow of the music.My overall impression is that he recorded these pieces before knowing them fully, and letting them mature properly. Hobson probably has what it takes from a technical perspective, but this CD is not musically satisfying.Also, the sound on the recording lacks the mellow, homogenous quality of the best piano recordings, which further reduces the pleasure. Perhaps he will re-record these works in better conditions?"
1,Broke within an hour of playing with it.,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas and it broke within an hour of playing with it! What a piece of garbage. She has a bunch of reels she can't view until I buy a new one. I couldn't find the classic red one, I didn't realize how terrible this one would be. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,No good!,"Had to comment on this as well. Like almost all the other reviews... ours also didn't work after a little while. And needing a screwdriver to ""open"" it and change the discs... ridiculous. Buy the original! My 3.5 year old will certainly be able to handle changing the dics by himself!"
4,Superb guitar-driven rockabilly,"Pete & The Atomics (not to be mistaken for The Atomics, a US rockabilly trio) is a 4-piece band that plays authentic, guitar-driven rockabilly. All the 15 tracks on their 2003 album, ""Let's Talk About The Good Things"" are originals, mostly written by lead singer Pierre Laru. Recommended."
1,too much to pay for a couple with zero to offer,"It is beyond me how any person with a functioning brain could ever find the Windsors more than the most over publicized, most tedious couple who ever inhabited the pages of People Magazine and its predecessors. What is even more alarming is that there are people willing to pay $67.50 for a book of pictures of the duke, the duchess and their collection of stuff. Pardon me for my rant, but I needed to do it. I don't think I've ever typed out my feeings on this subject before. I've ranted about this couple more than I wish to admit.. but, hell, we all have our quirks."
1,a very poor effort,"There is very little I can add to the reviews already given, except to state that very little, if any, research seems to have been undertaken by the author. He has written a potted history of George whilst at the same time denigrating any of his friends/associates (eg Eric Clapton). The best piece of advice to anyone thinking of buying this book is ""don't"" - I only wish I had taken that advice...."
2,A Personal Editorial?,"Well, Elliot J. Huntley must not be interested in telling a concise history of George. His work sounds and feels like an editorial, with his personal thoughts all mixed in. If you just want to read more about the solo years of George then this book will infuriate you. He personally criticises most other artists George ever came into contact with or thought of as friends. Has he even listened to their music? He puts down Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, and many others. Now, this gets exhausting and stupid about two chapters in. I found myself getting very annoyed. However, it has loads of information hard to find on George's solo years. That is the only reason I gave this book two stars. One should think Mr. Huntley should stop writing books and actually go and sit down and listen to some decent music."
4,An Old Insight Made New,Interesting & provacative look inside our relationship to food. More than anything this book helped me see where we have lost our way in relation to food and the spiritual significance it's long had in our society. What's truly wonderful is that Altman has inspired me to recreate a ritual around my meals. To be more thoughtful in what & how I am eating with others. Thank you!
5,All Natural Therapies Are Fully Explained,"Excellent reference guide for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome sufferers. All therapies are natural and very beneficial. It also warns you on what medicines should not be mixed with others. It lists important websites. And, it helps you create a regimen of therapies and vitamins that are right for you."
1,Nothing new here...,"Something to pass the time on an airplane trip. Simple-minded and non-threatening, and not very insightful - more like a series of ""newer"" Reader's Digest articles."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"This is a great set for any Man in Black fan. Like always, the songs are simple and to the point. ""Give My Love To Rose"" chokes me up every time, and ""There You Go"" reminds me of my past (as should for any man). Besides the mainstream hits that the ""Walk The Line"" movie featured, this is Mr. Cash's beginnings and every fan should own it. You can't go wrong. This set is best heard with the sound turned up all the way and with some good Whiskey or an ice-cold six pack.... cheers!!!"
2,Madman's Tale,"Better skip the reader's reviews and try another book. This one is far worse than it's rated there. I tried it for what I believed it would entertain me, but it did not."
4,Hot Icebreakers,"There are so many great ways to get a group started with this book. It's perfect for the people who are inactive and very active. From get-to-know-games to every-day-fun. This book covers business meetings, weekly meetings, workshops, and almost every other type of get-together. The groups sizes go from small to huge. I would definitly recommend this book for any coordinator or leader. Enjoy and have fun!"
3,"Switzerland: Zauerli, Yodel Of Appenzell","This is a very interesting CD, but you had better know what you are looking for before buying. I did not and got it on the recommendation of a salesperson. Surprise! These are very slow yodelers, I don't know how else to describe it. Sort of like dead men yodeling. I like it and am glad I heard it, but sorry I had to pay to do so. I will most likely only play this disc rarely. Be sure that this is what you want before you buy, it is not at all what I expected or would call traditional yodeling."
2,Disappointed between advertising and product received,"Beware the photo from Acme reflects a straight forward modern design, inclusive of comtporary cylindrical metal legs. You get the modern design end table, BUT if you base your selection on the comtemporary legs be ready for a major disappointment! What you get are square, stubby feet that look really cheesy. The cylindrical legs are no longer available from Acme, so the picture is false advertising. The furniture is slightly smaller than dimensioned, but also quite a bit shorter due to the squatty feet!"
4,The Little End Table,Order arrived quickly; sooner than predicted.Item was well packaged; arrived with no damage.Assembly instructions were clear.Makes an excellent end table in a modern setting.
1,Go buy a Kid's Practice Pole Instead! Zero Stars,This product was terrible. It broke after 4 uses. I bought a $10 2' child's fishing rod instead & attached a mouse. Works like a champ for going on 2 months now. Don't waste money on this.
3,Still a gadget.,"I had high hopes for this little scanner. It is certainly not bad, but it has a number of annoying problems. The learning curve can be a bit steep (at least an hour before you're comfortable scanning basic text, saving it to a file and preparing it for download). As for downloading it to your PC for editing, storage or printing, that requires either a IrDA port(most laptops have one) or on most desktops, an add-on serial device or USB device. My impression is that it will wind up in the drawer sometime soon, relegated to that dark corner that 'early adopters' often fill to the brim."
2,OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED,"I ORDERED THESE CANDIES AND OF COURSE I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I LOVE GINGER CANDIES....BUT I FOUND THEM AT LEAST FIVE(6)SIX LOCAL STORES FOR WAY LESS THAT I PAID FOR THEM ON THIS SITE...I WILL CERTAINLY DO MY PRICE-CHECK, LOCALLY FOR CERTAIN ITEMS BEFORE I PURCHASE THEM ONLINE....."
1,not the same,"I have used this foundation in the the same color ""beige"" for at least 10 years. Recently the local store I purchase it from has quite carrying it so I looked to buy it online. The product I was sent said beige and the container looked the same but it is a totally different color - I can't even wear it! i held it up to my ""beige"" and it looks like a much yellower version of makeup.. Neddless to say it is a waste of money for me - I bought 2! I will not order again."
1,Underachievement,Leaked gas and Would not light. I am buying burnamatic now and sending this pos. Back and would not buy anything But gas from these clowns
3,Didn't live up to my expectations.,"I loved The Harvest and was expecting Punkinhead to be a great addition to Boondox's catalog, but to me, it falls flat. It's probably the darkest release that Psychopathic has had out in years, but to me nothing really stands out. I like Sleep Stalker, but other than that, the rest of the songs are just mediocre. Boondox is working on his next full length album which is due out sometime in 2008, and I expect him to return to full freshness."
3,a good EP for the price,"i liked the EP but i only liked 2 out of the 7 songs ""Punkinhed"" and ""Southern Nights"" boondox is a good add to psychopathic records but he does stand up to for more artists like anybodykilla(abk) but over all its was worth the cash i spent to get it."
1,A beautiful subject spoiled,"This book definitely does NOT read like a novel (contrary to the propaganda on the cover). While the research is exhaustive, it reads like an assembly of facts scribbled on note cards. There's no insight into the person to tie it all togehter. Even worse the descriptions of the Nash's work is unnecessarily shallow even for the layman. I got through this book inspite of the writting, but only because I find the man, his work & his disease so fascinating."
5,A Major work of biographical literature,"This is a great work, comparable perhaps only to Skidelsky's bio of Keynes. Most bios are of sympathetic, yet flawed figures. What is amazing is that the book is so well written and plotted that it is hard to put down, and yet Nash is a childish, inhumane and rather unsympathetic man. I have seen the hollowed figure of Nash around Princeton. He is a quiet strange and distant soul. But this work brings his genius and his flaws to a brilliant light."
5,"Review of ""A Beautiful Mind""",Purchased a used version of the book. It was like a new book! Thanks! I would recommend used books from this vendor.
5,Complex Man-A Bio That Runs True,"A while back I was glancing through one of my wife's magazines and found this article on John Nash. I read with interest and inexplicably began staring at one of the photos. ""Oh, my God!"" I recognized him. D floor. Firestone Library at Princeton University. For a while I had studied there rather steadily and spent a fair amount of time on D floor - coke machines and chatter. John Nash used to show up there fairly regularly and saw me as well. There was some gossip from the other D floor patrons about a professor in whose life something had gone wrong. Eventually Mr. Nash started to talk to me and started to show me books he was reading. I was fairly young and quite honestly became uncomfortable and uneasy for various reasons and did not promote future contacts although now I wish I had. Mr. Nash's life is fascinating to me, and I salute his achievements and recommend this book."
4,A Great Book for Insight About John Nash,"I saw the movie and was vey interested to learn more about John Nash. This book gave me the information that I craved. I was shocked to learn about his alternative lifestyle. Although this book contained more information than I needed to know about the world of mathematics and mathematicians, I loved learning about the 'history' of John Nash. I would highly recommend it."
5,Deeply satisfying,How do you capture the strange without making it either freakish or mundane? This book does it. It also conveys the essence of the mathematics without becoming arcane or trivial. The account of Princeton in the late 1940's is superb.
5,Fantastic video teaching the importance of environmental protection,"I was first introduced to this video in the 90s, and is a constant favorite during the K to 2nd years.Always worth taking out the VHS player or converting it to digital."
2,small non-profit organization treasurer,"This book is not for bookkeepers. It is more for accountants who want to understand non-profit accounting. If a bookkeeper needs to know the proper day to day and month to month entries for this kind of organization, than this book is not for you.However, if you are an accountant, you may be able to glean good information about the basic philosophy of non-profit organizations, such as account set-up and reporting."
3,Not bad but not indispensible,"I purchased this book in to prepare myself for a change of career, hopefully moving from the for-profit to the not-for-profit world. Having worked as an accountant for many years, this book was challenging but useful. I would definitely NOT recommend it for the neophyte in the accounting world.One of my pet peeves is books which have numerous typos. Having read the second edition of this book, I found way too many typos to be acceptable. This forces the reader to try to figure out what the author is trying to say rather than trying to grasp the content of the book. This is truly distracting and unnecessary."
4,Great looking crib,"We really like the way this crib looks. The wood is soft, so it does ding a bit, but you don't really notice the dings unless you look very closely. Friends of ours have the Emily crib and after 2 years, they are still happy with it. We love the fact that it has no pressboard in it or any weird-smelling chemicals."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I love this crib!!! I bought it for my sister who was pregnant with her 3rd child and its great! We put it together with ease. They had to move and this crib was easy to take apart and put back together. Its very sturdy. The pictures dont do it justice. Its a gorgous crib!
4,Sturdy Crib,"This crib is very well made and the wood feels very sturdy. It's fairly easy to put together assuming there are two of you to do it. It does scratch kind of easy, but don't think any less than any other wood. It will be interesting to see how it holds up over the years."
1,Dents and scratches!!,"I had high expectations due to the positive reviews. This thing is a piece of junk. I tried to hook the mobile on it and the wood made an awful crunching sound and dented. The slightest touch or bang and this thing will scratch and dent so be careful. I've only owned it 3 months, have not yet even used it, and it already looks awful. Not to mention the screws are all exposed. Its an eyesore. There is no way I am going to be able to convert it to a bed when my son is older, it will be too scratched and dinged. I am so disappointed :( For my next child I will be purchasing a more expensive brand made with real wood. You obviously get what you pay for. :("
1,Missing parts essential for assembly,"I can't actually comment on the assembled crib itself since there were multiple pieces missing from the box and I'm still waiting for all of the pieces to arrive. Several weeks ago I started assembling the crib and found that the lock washers were not included in the package. I wrote the company and they sent lock washers which arrived a couple of weeks later. Once they arrived, I again tried to assemble to crib, only to find that the mounting brackets were missing. I guess I should have checked to make sure all of the parts were there when I first discovered the lock washers were missing, but I assumed the chances that multiple items would be missing were zero. I won't buy from this company again."
1,indentations and scratches,"The crib's wood has many scratches, indentations, tears on arrival, even before we started to use it.It was hard to put it together. It is also difficult to see the baby in the crib as railings have bold parts."
5,"Adorable, perfect, sturdy","Easy to assemble, adorable. Looks just as good as any high-end crib from PBK or elsewhere. Just perfect and highly recommended."
5,Great!,"It's a great crib. It's sturdy, not too big and it's made out of real wood. I also purchased DaVinci changing table. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,nightmare to assemble,We bought this crib for my mother's home and it has been an absolute nightmare to put together. For my own home we bought Pottery Barn Kids' Brookfield crib and it was MUCH simpler. It's definitely worth the extra dollars to buy a crib that is easier to build to save the hassle and headache.
3,This crib is a PITA to put together.,"I put my daughter's Graco Victoria crib together in about an hour all by myself without much trouble. I am by no means a mechanical minded woman. But this crib is driving me nuts! I've spent over an hour, and I'm still only about 25% finished. I cannot seem to get the screws to line up right and get in tight. Also, while trying to assemble, one of the sides fell forward and scratched the crap out of the back of the crib--but the part that faces out, not against the wall. So now I'll have a huge scratch where everyone can see. If I hadn't spent so much money on it, I'd toss it outside and have a bonfire.I'm sure it would be a great crib if I could ever get it assembled before my son is too old for it--he's nearly 4 months. But then there are still all the scratches..."
1,Garbage - Stay Away,"We bought this crib to take it overseas. At first it seemed like what everyone else thinks about it - stable, heavyset, sturdy etc.After moving once (taking it apart and remounting it), the side panel literally started falling apart around the screws' holes (both the bigger ones as well as the smaller standard cruciform head ones).Turns out its massiveness is only apparent. In fact this bed is made of grade C particle chipboard. After unscrewing and remounting it a couple of times, say to lower the bottom as your child grows, you will find that this bed is really a cheap, low quality piece of furniture that just looks impressive.Fellow parents - stay away from this one."
3,"Nice looking crib, but wood does scratch really easily","My husband and I took some time searching for a nice affordable crib that our little one would be able to grow into. After seeing such good reviews, we chose this one. It shipped quickly, and was easy to put together. However, as my husband was putting it together we noticed that the wood scratches really easy. I made protectors right away to protect the wood from the mobile and for our little one's teeth (our first one loved biting down on his crib when he got to about 9 months old).So the bottom line, this is a pretty crib, the wood color is nice (we got the espresso) and the look of the crib is nice. However, your little one will surely scratch up the wood if you don't protect it... which is a bit annoying. For being a crib made for kids, I would of expected the wood to be a bit more kid proof."
2,Not worth it,"The instructions are awful. Nothing was labeled so it was a guessing game to try and put it together. There were no plugs to put in screw holes to cover them up either. Once all put together it is a nice crib, but we will never purchase anything from Davinci again."
2,Too expensive,"2 years ago i bought something virtual identical (Stork Craft Tuscany 4-in-1 Stages Crib, Espresso) and it was only $175. really, it's just pieces of wood made by sweatshop workers. also the bottom of the front piece is too high off the ground and my toddler managed to crawl in a couple of times but not able to crawl out. this is not a problem with the stork craft crib."
5,Sturdy crib that is very cute,"The crib is even nicer than I anticipated. While some customers did not care for the hardware (bolts) showing, I really do not think that it detracts from the overall appearance of the crib - especially when you put the bedding on it. The crib is solid (no drop sides) and the style is very cute - perfect for a girl or boy. It is pure white, not off-white or cream. So, it is easy to mix and match different brands of furniture. While we are still waiting for our baby's birth, I know that we are going to love this crib. I had a drop-side crib for my first baby and was hesitant to use it after recent recalls on drop-side cribs. You really can't beat this crib given the nice style, safety of the static sides, function (converts to toddler bed), and price."
5,So far so good!,We got this crib for our son who is due in November. My husband put it together easily and it looks beautiful in his nursery. As some other reviewers stated the wood is soft. I attached a mobile to the side and later decided to return it. It left 2 marks where it was attached but it is hardly noticeable. I will purchase a teething rail when necessary. We also got the Kalani changing table/dresser combo and the quality isn't quite as good as the crib. There are some chips and white marks on the wood. Overall I am happy with the set for the price.
4,DaVinci Kalani Crib,"This is a beautiful crib. We have been using it for 2 weeks now and so far so good. It is really sturdy and the color is beautiful. It was easy for my husband to put it together. It took him about 40 minutes. Plus, it came with the toddler rail!We will see how is holds up when we have to take it apart and move and when we have to adjust the height for our baby.It would be nice if it had screw covers for it, but those are easy to find in any hardware store."
4,Davinci Kalani M5501 convertible crib,"I bought this product a month ago.I think its good for the price.Only thing I would point out is the quality of wood,two sides of the crib was chipped off probably while in transit."
3,"Nice, but oh, the SCRATCHES (and poor customer service from manufacturer)","I agree with other reviewers- this is a very nice crib but boy does it scratch easily (we bought cherry). It had some scratches already when we bought it, and then got some more after assembly- once when my cat jumped up on it, and another when my husband tried to rub the cat scratch, and scratched it some more with his fingernail. All in all, it's cosmetic, but it's a disappointment as the scratches are on the front center of the rail (and we don't even have a baby yet).Another reviewer suggested contacting the manufacturer about scratches, and I did that- they offered to sell me a touch up pen for about $11. GEESH. The least they could do was provide that free of charge!all in all, It looks OK from a distance and is very sturdy so baby will sleep well,but I'm disappointed by the scratching and the customer service."
2,cheap crib,We bought the crib for our Feb 11 baby and have used it less than 50 hours because of cosleeping. We recently turned it into a toddler bed and within 2 weeks the metal plate has separated from the wood. This crib has had little use and is now useless to us.
2,Way too Easy,"You'll be selling this game used on Amazon (which is exactly how I bought it) within a week. It is way too easy to solve.Why didn't Namco give more challenges? The map has 3 islands left untouched at the end of the game. Why didn't they use them for bigger/tougher bosses??The game is very cute, though. 2 stars for cuteness."
5,aunt tilly strikes again,Aunt Tilly thinks Dave is having heart trouble; and he is just not the kind she thinks; Dave falls in love with the literacy expert that comes to his ranch and must convince her to take him; Aunt Tilly thinks Uncle Walter has returned as a llama; much laughter in this book; one of my favorites
5,An Excellent Collection of Reviews from Powers,"This revised and expanded collection of Thomas Powers' reviews of books on intelligence and national security for the New York Review of Books is an excellent resource on a wide range of topics. Powers has a demonstrated knowledge of many aspects of the history of US intelligence gathering since World War II, and he shows it in this collection.Beginning with a review of the life of Billy Donovan, the progenitor of WWII American espionage, and ending with a review of books on the current threat from international terrorism, Powers covers a broad spectrum of topics. Though he is much stronger on the Cold War history, the author is able to bring his background in history to comment on current threats. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in national security and the intelligence world."
5,Phenomenally good SF,"This is one of the most complex, compelling sagas of the far future I have ever read, and I've read a LOT of science fiction, including most of the ""classic age"" authors like Heinlein, Asimov, Clement, and Clarke. The characters are so realistic it's hard to return to ""reality"" after finishing any of Foster's books, and this is no exception. Read it!Now here's some good news for those fans who have been trying to find a copy of this book since it went out of print a couple of decades ago: it's back, and as part of a one-volume edition of the three ""Ler"" books, called ""The Book of The Ler"", available right here on Amazon. Enjoy!"
5,Dead Sailor Blues is the most comprhensive master piece,"Orangutang, the savage slatemaker, created this epic album of he-manly preportion. Mind you, this was there second and last album; ... The awesome pounding lyrics of Crispin Voryore, the washed out rott blues riffs of David Akari, the explosive bass line of sweat John Stlles, and the druming explosive of Rick Allie all makes for an dynamic sound of high pitch vocals and hiltrong rock. Orangutang kicks klocks, pulls bones, knocks the jocks, and hauls the music to an overdive sound of pure rocking rocks.Each track features raw power and intense flavor, the title track, ""Somphus & Trackaday"" features the opus of hilthrong rock-ox. Then the steady stream ...follows forth, never disapointing, creating a bone cruching rythm that will knock you on! Then don't forget the outragiuos epilouge, ""Surf Condestial"",.... I was three shots into the opus, I can never forget the posses pose of Crispin Vahhess, the led mouth lead stinger."
2,just okay.,"This hookah was good for the price... but it was also cheap in quality and didn't come with everything they promised. It also doesn't look the same as the picture... be aware. It is great for your first hookah. Also, I fixed it but the bowl was damaged."
1,Product is Great - wish they would have sent me the right one!,"Love the L'anza Healing Style Taffy and cannot find it in stores. Ordered from Amazon - a 4.4 oz size and was sent a 2.5 oz size (half the product for the full price). Unfortunately they stated they cannot send me a replacement but I could place the order all over again. A bit sceptical, I don't want the same problem again in another 10 days. Wish I could buy it in stores. Returning, reordering, and another 10 days wait sucks (not to mention a possible 4 week wait for the refund on the first order)."
3,"Good, but don't call it historical fiction","This series is well written, with some interesting insights about the figures involved in the death of the Roman Republic, but Iggulden takes too many liberties with the facts to justify a description of ""historical."" Events happen years out of date, characters removed from their places and thrust onto the stage, natural deaths becoming murders; they all detract from an otherwise good read. At least the author freely acknowledges the changes he has wrought."
1,Maybe the worst book I've ever read,"I am a lover of all things related to Rome and the Roman empire, but I can't believe how bad this book is. It would be different if Rome had a ho-hum, unexciting history but given its true history I don't know why anyone would put forth such a poor, and frankly, LESS interesting backstory to what were in fact extraordinary events, people, and places.I'm so glad I checked this out of the library and didn't buy it. It might be the worst book I've EVER read.I agree with other reviewers, the Colleen McCullough books are wonderful. And for light reading about that era, the Marcus Didius Falco mysteries by Lindsey Davis are an enjoyable read. This series, this author, however is an utter waste of time, paper, and ink."
1,it jams and custumer service sucks,mINE JAMED SO I SENT IT BACK AND RECEIVED A REFERBISHED ONE WHICH JAMS PERIODICALY. EACH TIME I LOSE ALL THE INFORMATION AND THEY CHARGE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO RETREIVE IT
5,Vegetarian S.O.D.,This is an excellent brand of Glisodin. It's odorless and tasteless. The price was also very reasonable.
3,Bonus 4th disc clarification,"The bonus 4th disc is only avaiable in the UK and on WWE Shop site. Retailers (including amazon.com) will be selling the 3-disc set.Bonus 4th Disc:vs. Tito SantanaMadison Square Garden - 03/24/80vs. Sonny Rogers & Chuck GreenlyAWA - 08/08/81WWE Championship Matchvs. Terry FunkSaturday Night's Main Event - 01/04/86vs. King Harley RaceSaturday Night's Main Event - 03/12/88Hulk Hogan Wins the 1990 Royal Rumble - 01/21/90vs. EarthquakeSummerslam - 27/08/90""Mean"" Gene Okerlund interviews Hulk HoganWWE Raw Homecoming - 10/03/05"
1,Wasted Money,"My verbally ""gifted"" child couldn't relate to, and refused to read the stories written by Adora. I didn't find any useful tools related to teaching writing either. So, its neither interesting reading material nor a good teaching reference book. It would have been much better if the authors had focused on one or the other rather than the mixed format. This will likely sit on a shelf collecting dust. A pretty useless purchase for us."
3,"Cute Toy, Unattractive Doll","I bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter who still loves to play with dolls. However, this toy has already gotten pushed to the back of the closet. The concept is cute, but the doll is very unattractive."
3,Misrepresented,"The title was misleading, the actual DVD has little to do with the Battle of Sailor's Creek. I don't understand the reason for ""Little"" in the title as well. All references I've read, or heard concerning the Battle, I've never seen/heard that term little used. I also expected it to be as good as the book...Black Day of the Army April 6, 1865...The Battle of Sailor's Creek, by Greg Eanes. Afraid not.Other than those reasons...the DVD is well filmed, and gives a brief history to the War, and insight to some of the medical aspects, which is often overlooked."
3,Not the best in the series,"I love some of the previous CDM cd's in the series, but this one is definitely disappointing. Nothing inspiring or innovative. My favourites in the4 CDM series are numbers 4, 9, 11 and the 25th Anniversary Addition."
2,Cafe Del Mar contact Blank and Jones,"I agree with Mr.""Graduate Student"" in that Cafe Del Mar has lost something with this latest CD. Where has the effort gone in this production? Sure it's relaxing, but it's just not entertaining. Blank and Jones have taken over the trend with their new Relax II CD. Check it out. It may fill the void while CDM gets it together."
3,What Price Life and Liberty?,"Not an ocean, but the mountains. How much must one sacrifice to keep the twin treasures of life and liberty in Nazi Europe? Not exactly The Sound of Music minus the score, but...a good, short read. A brave Jewish family, with two quick-witted daughters, determines to escape Austria in 1938, before they are relocated into a concentration camp. A brief introduction to elementary children about racial atrocities without the gore. Many historical details are quietly woven into this modest tale of familial determination. This book should stimulate questions and interest in the Holocaust."
4,Good story for grade level.,I used this book to discuss the holocaust and make text to world connections in my 6th grade social studies.
3,Explaining what the Holocaust meant to the children,"Having to wear yellow stars and being chased home from school even by your best friend are hard things for a young person.Traveling only at night and hiding when anyone comes and during the day,having to sell all your valuable things and finally escaping where others were sent to ""camps"" never to return.Being a Jew in Europe during WWII wasn't how children usually see life.I liked the book."
2,Intended for little kids.,"I am very interested in the holocaust and have been reading every book I could get my hands on about the subject. I found this one in my sister's room and decided, well, what the heck, It's short anyway, I can just zip through this! I knew that it was intended for grade1- grade 3 audiece but it probably wouldn't even appeal to them either. I just couldn't find anything interesting about it. The book is about a girl named Clara and her sister who have th get away from their country and to England. There really wasn't much description in it and nothing really happened. I also found it very unrealistic. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the author really tried to impress people and from the looks of the other reveiws, it looks like a few people did like it."
1,So BAD!,"This mixer already broken it burned after a month ,my wife used it for second time and after 10min the smoke came out from the machine,so what should i do take it to the trush or what?PS: 1 star is to much for this mixer sorry amazon but love to shop from you and i always will!\ILL NEVER BUY THIS ITEM ANYMORE ITS WASTING MONEY...!!"
4,"4 Years old, and still going strong","I bought this mixer as my first Amazon purchase in 2006. (I am not going back to review my items, ha)I still use this mixer to this day. I make pizza dough almost weekly in here for pizza's and garlic knots.This mixer has not given my one ounce of problems. Cakes, whipped cream, batter, you name it, I have mixed it in here.I even had a hand problem a year or so back where I was in a cast for a few weeks, and I used this thing to mix my home made meatballs.I am starting to outgrow this mixer though, I am growing in my cooking, and want to start making my own pasta and sausages. Without the attachment on the front, I am starting to lok toward Kitchen Aid.This is a great alternative to a Kitchen Aid if you don't want to spend the money. Motor is just as strong, and the mixer spins the same. It gets the sides pretty well.4 stars are for a great product, but I am starting to miss the attachment option."
5,Hamilton Beach Electrics - All Metal Stand mixer - Suguar,"After reading hundreds of reviews on stand mixers, I ordered the Hamilton Beach.I love it. I have only had it for about two weeks and use it every other day. It is a joy to use and does a fine job. I find it much easier and more pleasant to work with than the Kitchen Aid I was used to.It whipped up eggs white like a dream. My husband says he has gained weight since I have been making such delicious cakes & muffins.So many others have commented on the positive features so I will not repeat them but I find them to be true for me too.It looks great and I love the lock feature on the head. This lock feature is one that the Kitchen Aid didn't have. I am sooo pleased and the three year warranty gives me piece of mind."
5,Stand Mixer Heaven,"HubbyDearest gave me this for Christmas, after we shopped various brands. This is rated a Consumer Report best buy. Attractively engineered, heavy, sturdy, and well-built, I expect it to serve me well for a long time. I especially am impressed that they have the confidence to put a THREE YEARS WARRANTY on this product. I 'test drove' it and it seems to be working just fine. Once I have put it to actual use, I will add further comments to this review."
5,Great mixer,"After agonizing over this purchase, reading the negative reviews against positive, I'm so glad I finally decided on this purchase. I've had it for a couple of months now, and it has been put to the test with yeast breads and cookies as well as various other mixing challenges. It has performed well in all aspects. Haven't had a problem at all with undo shaking of mixer head or problem with ingredients mixing properly or having to scrap bowl repeatedly. And it is really quiet. Haven't used the splatter shield as that has not been a problem nor has adding ingredients to the bowl. I would recommend this mixer."
5,Dreamy,"I've always stared longingly at the nicer mixers, problem was the price. I couldn't even put them on my wedding registry I could NEVER ask for something that cost THAT MUCH. Yet mixer after mixer fell prey to cheesecake mixes, or just plain fell apart. I finally decided it was time to pony up but wanted to make sure I was getting the best deal - and surprisingly I found this product. Look at what it competes with, this comes with 2 more years on it's warranty, more watts than most of the competitor's models, and a MUCH more affordable price. HELLO LOVE! I just whipped up my first batch of cookie dough and this performed like a champ! Can't wait to put it to the test with a cheesecake recipe, mostly because I'm confident it will do just fine. I actually did a jig when UPS delivered the mixer, that's how happy I am with this :)"
5,Hamilton Beach Eclectrics Stand Mixer,The Stand mixer is very hefty and strong. I have had no problem using it. It looks beautiful and is much more quiet than my previous mixer which was about 25 years old. I am glad I made the change.
5,Where have you been?,"Although I haven't purchased it yet. I WILL be tomorrow for my mom. I grew up using HB. It's the only kind my mother (who's in her 80s) ever bought. 20+ years ago, she gave me her old one and it lasted until a couple of years ago. I'm so excited to find they are still out there.I'll do another review once I've purchased it and she used it. But I'm sure it'll be a great review (unless I happen to get a lemon.) Just like anything you buy, there are always a few lemons in the bunch."
1,worst customer service ever,"I bought this product ,it came with out instructions or the recipe book I emailed the customer service 5 times and they sent me a PDF file of the recipe book said could not get the real book what a JOKE this company is ! Never buy from them again,so much for an American company, Customer service rates a ZERO"
3,Mixer Review,"Works well but it shakes when the dough hook is used and makes noise. Other than that, I like it."
1,Another over hyped bore!,"Yet again i fall for the hype surrounding ""The Horror Film Of The Year"". I expected a diamond in the rough, but all i found was a pile of mud that is no laughing matter, nor is this film. I can't believe a review compared this films humor to Heathers!With bad acting and a bland script, this film sits comfortably alongside Hatchet and the Day Of The Dead remake as the worst dvd releases in the last year. For real horror/comedy see ""FIDO"" instead."
3,Dead Can't Dance,"DANCE OF THE DEAD is a fun watch if one can deal with absurd plot devices.* The dead come out of the ground as if they are 1 foot down in soil only.* The zombies are apparently caused by a nearby power plant.* Zombies can drive cars.* Zombies enjoy rock music and will ""dance"" to it. (Instead of eating you.)* There is a...(Are you sitting down?)...frog zombie.Other than this sort of thing, the movie is fun to watch with some very funny scenes. For the most part, the film is full of small scenes that by themsleves are enjoyable. With that in mind, the movie is watchable. Zombie buffs will like it and fans of teen comedy will like it.One issue of note: This DVD has more trailers for other movies than I have EVER seen on a DVD release. It seemed to go on forever. I like trailers, so this was not an issue for me. However, it can be most annoying if your time is limited. Be prepared to fast forward."
3,"zombies, zombies, and more zombies",This is just a George Romero wanna be !!! Although that is not that bad and if you love ZOMBIES you will like this movie.
3,Just another review...,"It was entertaining, but could have been better. Too PG, if you know what I mean. Needs more gore and and more excitement, it was just a bit slow."
5,Terrific concert,"Even though there were songs that were also in other concerts, we enjoyed them all over again in this one. Yanni had a terrible time getting the DVD made since it rained for two days cancelling parts of the concert. By the thrid day they were able to finish the recording process before a live audiance. Having struggled with the weather the performers were determined to turn out a great concert and it shows in their enthusiasm and the quality of their performances. I highly recommend this DVD to all that love Yanni's music."
2,Worst Yanni concert ever,"The quality of the picture was not there, and is missing some songs from the list on the DVD.I understand that Yanni and the musicians had to deal with the bad weather in Puerto Rico, but this concert shouldn't have been produced and sold."
1,Poor Technology for the price,"Abysmal bit of engineering. I returned the first one because I thought it must be defective. No camera at this price could have bad focusing and snail-like write times and lag, right? Wrong! This camera has a sharp lens, but do your homework. It's a VERY slow chunk of glass and the contrast based AF module ruins shot after shot. Lag and write times mean you can't catch a special moment unless everyone agrees on a time and place for it. It's almost funny, unless you can't get your money back. You could make all kinds of excuses for this dog if it cost 279.00, but it's current price of close to 700 dollars just buy a DSLR. Cameras are about being able to shoot focused shots when you hit the shutter button, without DELAY. The 8800 is incapable of that by a long mile."
3,"Expected more from this camera, buy a SLR","I bought this camera few months after it came out. I like the features that it has. The Remote, the stabilization, the zoom.Why, you ask I give this camera a 3 star?well, first of all, I took many pictures with normal light. The results aren't as great as Nikon advertised. During my first use, I had pictures that for some odd reason gave ppl black lips. No, I know for sure that they weren't wearing any lipstick.I asked Nikon support for this anomaly, they still haven't gotten back to me. I just updated the firmware today. Hopefully this makes a difference in normal picture taking situations. The lip color for some pictures is a mystery. I haven't seen this problem much lately. Maybe I don't take in door pictures as much.The Remote, it doesn't work well either. It seems to work when it wants to work.I do like Nikon's softwares that accompanies this camera."
2,A good camera but horribly unreliable,"I loved this camera but I have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous ""system error 2"" design fault which plagues many of these. The repair service is slow - the camera has been in repair 50% of the year I have had it."
5,Wonderful!,"Any serious fan of popular songwriting should buy this book. Frank Loesser is frequently overlooked when discussing the great songwriters of the 20th century. Hopefully, this book will correct that. I just got the book a few days ago, and skimming through it I've laughed out loud and have been moved by Loesser's facility with language. There are dozens of unpublished songs in here, and I yearn to hear the melodies, especially Loesser's own.Meticulously researched and bountifully exuberant, I will treasure this book for many years. Thanks to all who assembled it."
1,a boring story,"I agree with the other single star review ""boring with a capitol B"". What more can I say other than I'm glad it was free and all I lost was time."
4,Very entertaining,"I read this book yesterday, and did not expect to like it as much as I did. I wasn't sure if I would be able to understand the aviation ""talk"", (and to be honest, I didn't get it all), but that did not detract from my enjoyment of the story. I felt that the characters were well developed, and that enough clues were given to make it fair to the reader, while still keeping an element of suspense in the story. I do not like to read extraneous gory details, and senseless violence, and neither was present in this book.The book was nicely formatted. I noticed a couple of spelling errors and one instance where missing punctuation caused me to read a line a few times, before I got what was being said, but these things were not really a distraction for me."
1,HORRIBLE!,These are a horrible waste of money! They don't do anything. My knees don't feel any more stable at all. They are big and bulky. And you can't return or exchange them. I hate them and went back to wearing my 7 year old brace.
2,"Support the knee, but minimizes the knee movement",This product is supposed to hold your knee in a positive position. The problem for me is that I'm not able to leave it on long enough to feel the effects. When you strap it on it hurts the back of you knee as you use it for biking or weight training and minimizes the full range of motion. It probably would be better if the mfg cut a relief area behind the knee.
1,I have not received MY KNEE BRACE YET!!!,I cannot tell you if I like by CHO-PAT knee strap because I have not recevied it yet.... and I am wondering where it is. Please find out for me.Thank you
4,Very Comfortable,I have runner's knee and I have tried a couple of different braces...this one seems to do the trick.
2,Dubious Value,"Knee problems are highly individualistic. What works for one person doesn't for another. It didn't help me that I could feel. However, the tight pressure did provide some comfort effect, I think. The good news is it's much better than the Original Cho-pat, which I bought at the same time and found to be worthless, whereas I wore this one several times.But, given the fairly cheap price, give a try and perhaps it's exactly what you need."
4,Works well without the bulk of a typical kneebrace,"This has really helped with my right knee that's messed up in so many ways I'm amazed that my lower leg's still attached. With this brace I'm able to hike and lightly jog without much pain.And, unlike other braces I've used over the years, it's minimalist enough to almost forget it's there while using it.My only complaints are that it gets really hot and wet with sweat when I use it to exercise and that the ""Cho-Pat"" badge is peeling off after only a couple of weeks worth of use.Otherwise I'm pleased as punch."
3,knee protection,This item often slips down over knee and also makes your leg sweat. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Rehashes old material,"I was really disappointed with this book. There wasn't one piece of information in it that I didn't already know; and many pieces of information that I know that weren't in the book. In addition, regardless of what actors say (and Mr. Keitel has often said this) about the characters they play not reflecting their personal lives, it's not true. A person's personal life is always reflected on the screen; it's what makes the actor able to project the character they are playing. Therefore, I wanted to know more about Mr. Keitel's personal life so I could get a better picture of his professional life. I wanted to know more about his past and current relationships with Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Perhaps I should write my own book."
2,"Okay for water pumps, but prefer neti pot","We purchased this unit before there were any reviews written, with the hopes that it would help with a swollen turbinate/sinus condition. While the pump did pulse the water through the nose, it did not seem to encourage the flow of cilia any more than the daily use of the neti pot. In fact, we prefer the neti pot, as it is easier to use, less expensive, feels great, and doesn't require so much trouble with all the rinsing and mechanics of use. Plus, the neti pot travels much better too, if you are on the road. All in all, this unit sits on our bathroom shelf, unused after a few weeks (and that was months ago). We'd strongly recommend daily use of the neti pot if you are looking to have convenience and good nasal irrigation."
2,Way overpriced,"Well, this does what it does, vibrates while squirting water (adjustable pressure) but it reminds me of kids' ten dollar walmart christmas toys like plastic slushie makers and what not. Doubt the motor will last many years. Don't know much about Grossan research; I think I bought this hurriedly after reading a sales pitch that resembled a medical review.Don't know what alternatives are around, but there's room for improvement on this cheapo. I'm not saying it doesn't work. Mine has run several hours properly, and doesn't smell overheating or smoky like a cheap blender would. It is about as noisy as one though, so don't expect 100% privacy when you're using it.I would probably recommend saving money and buying a used one in working order if you can; you won't feel so ripped off, I doubt any of these ever really get that much use, and cleaning isn't a big issue."
2,Poor quality photos,"I was disappointed with the quality of the photographs throughout this book. I purchased the book because I happen to own a painting taken from one of the photos that is in the original book and wanted some documentation. This book has been re-typeset so is easy to read, but the photos seem to be photos of the halftone prints from the original book and are distorted. The original photos are held by the Omaha Public Library, can be viewed online, and are outstanding."
3,Not what we expected,"I recently returned from New Orleans where I tried this coffee and loved it! The coffee was very strong, but not bitter. The chicory root evened everything out. However, 3 cans were very dented upon arrival, and the coffee was, well, disgusting. I am rating this a three, because I did not contact the seller about the dented cans, because that should not affect the quality of the coffee. However, this coffee did not taste at all like the coffee from Cafe Du Monde that I tried a month before in New Orleans."
5,Good Coffee,"I have been using this brand of coffee for over a year now and I really like it. Used to always use either Luzianne or French Market. This costs less and I cannot tell the difference, maybe someone else can, but not me."
5,Not just for New Orleans.,I grew up with this coffee around. It a Southeast Asian staple in the pantry! And yes I'm talking about about cafe sua da (iced coffee w/milk) in Vietnamese (but I'm Cambodian and we drink it as well). This is ten times better than starbucks. :) Yum!
1,I did not recieve the right amount of buckets,"The headline of this product says that I was supposed to recieve 6 ball buckets. In the mail I recieved only one ball bucket. I called amazon and asked for my other 5 buckets. They stated that they would only send me a refund. I do not want a refund, but I want the other 5 ball buckets. The bucket is very nice, but I ordered 6."
4,Shey,"I recall only seeing the Rawlings Logo when I ordered this bucket. When it was delivered it also has an image of a baseball player on the back of it. I ordered it for my daughter who plays fastpitch softball, so needless to say she didn't care for it much and I thought I was getting just the plain Rawlings emblem. However, outside of that you pretty much get what you see, a sturdy bucket with a thin pad covering. It helps on the knee strain so it serves its purpose nicely."
1,"Pretty watch, but poor quality - would not keep time reliably","I bought a Steinhausen Leonardo Automatic watch, but from a different seller. It is a very pretty watch, although the black hands on a gold dial can be hard to read.However, I had so many problems I stopped wearing it after about 6 weeks. It would keep perfect time for several days in a row, and then with no change of routine suddenly lose 5-15 minutes in a day. (I wore the watch every day, so it was not due to lack of winding.) Also, one of the decorative lugs fell off after about one month.Although the watch has a 1 year warrantee, because the problems I had were intermittant I had trouble getting it replaced.My conclusion: pretty watch, but poorly made."
5,sensual jazz,i bought this cd a few weeks ago and i'm already expecting the new one...d'n'b with a flavour of latin jazz(or nu jazz if you like) and a very sensual voice that's si*sé ( by the way spelled see-say)...enjoy!
1,wallet size,"What a disappointment. In looking at this book on Amazon.com, I took note of the number of pages, but assumed it was a ""normal"" sized book. The pictures may be good - who can tell; you cannot see them. Even now, seeing that the dimensions are noted as approximately 4"" square, I think this is an exaggeration. This book is wallet sized. This will be the first thing I have ever returned to Amazon. Buyer beware, as they say."
1,Poor picture quality,"I purchased this in Feb. 2002 based on the high reviews. So far, I found the picture quality to be about as bad as any camera I have owned. The flash either overexposes or underexposes. The worst part of all is the lack of crispness and vibrant colors to the pictures, flash or no-flash. I will try a premium quality paper to remedy this, though I should'nt have to in order to get decent photos."
1,Disapointed purchaser,"Item was completely misreprented in as new condition. It arrived in very much used condition.This item was not sold by Amazon, but by associate seller."
3,good one with fair value,"This one has followed Canon product's trait that is good quality with above average price. Overall, it's a good buy"
4,great!,"Next summer is better than summer boys. The tuttle girls (kelsi, ella, beth minus jamie) go back to the beach. Beth is totally in love with george but sad that he can't go with her this time so she can't help but like the attention of the hot lifegaurd. Kelsi, after what happened last time, wants a boy-free summer but keeps seeing the frat boy Tim, who she thinks is not her type but who knows? :) Ella, is tired of all the hookups and just wants a perfect guy. She finds one, but for once, she can't attract him!I loved the ending. It's wonderful. Such a happy ending. Can't wait to read 'Oh Baby'!"
1,"Ugh.,","It Was wonderful in the beginning but towards the middle and the end i got extrememly bored, and i think the author did to. It was quite preditcable, nothing that new."
2,By the book boring,"Sorry, but Matt Wagner is capable of so much more than what was displayed in this book. There's nothing wrong with it; however, there is nothing inventive or original contained in these pages. Cliche after cliche, our lead character progresses from injured doctor to superhero. While the artwork is nice and definitely a good start for Mr. Snyder, there's not much substance on which to draw on."
2,"Great Music, Disappointing Performance","As the title may suggest, i think this is a fabulous piece of music, however i must warn prospective punters against this particular recording, despite the composer himself being present. the woodwind are profoundly out of tune in various places and the recording quality itself is for some reason quite soft. Now, this may not bother some people, but i like my music loud and especially when it is so grandiose, as this work is. i have been told the best recording is of the u.s. air force band, which i have been unable to get hold. hope this was helpful."
2,not good,Dispersion of light to achieve fracture of white light is not significant. Maybe real crystal works betterLook for bigger maybe?
3,Kind of works,"My daughter had been learning about prisms at school and wanted one to do some ""experiments"" at home. I don't know if it's the quality of the plastic/glass or something else but it doesn't produce a very vivid rainbow. I've seen others that really make the colors pop. I'm no expert so I don't know the exact reason for this and maybe it's not this product's fault, but it was a bit underwhelming for her."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,I purchased this DVD for my two daughters for Christmas. Both are big fans of Hillary and I even enjoyed her until I tried watching the DVD with them. The audio portion is incredibly TERRIBLE. Lots of poor lip sync during the concert. The singing is so quiet you can hardly hear it. The music drowns it out. I can't believe they are selling this item with such poor quality. Don't waste your money! Even my 2 daughters of 9 and 5 have little interest in the DVD because it seems so fake and poorly produced.
1,reality,"Newsflash! This chubby girl can't sing! They should turn everything over to her obviously more talented sister. Then again, how can you be more talented than someone that has no talent?Do not purchase for your child; stick with Sesame Street."
3,Where's the DJ?,"I bought one of the other Cruisin' collections (1958) on LP awhile back, and what I really loved about it was that it was presented as an actual radio broadcast from the days when the songs were brand new. I decided to try Cruisin' 1967 on cassette, and to my disappointment it contained nothing but songs - contrary to the product descriptions I read before buying it. I assume the LP and CD versions of these things are all hosted by DJ's, but to me the casettes are a waste of money because there's nothing unique about just another collection of songs."
2,Dissapointing,"Not the happy folk music I was expecting, my partner is sicilian an she did not like it very much either"
5,Buy It You wont be disappointed,"Every track rocks. ALL Metal and Heavy, heavy heavy..bobby's singing is strong as ever, more growling and less high pitched as most of the overkill style, but excellent still."
5,NICE!,I really needed to get this for my friend since I broke hers. Overall I think this a bit overpriced I found it a bit cheaper somewhere else but I already purchase this.
4,"Using on smaller, loose limbs","This tool seems to be well-made and rugged. It works just fine on limbs still attached to trees, but not so well on small diameter loose limbs lying on the ground. No matter how slowly one closes the jaws, this tool tends to grab and shatter detached limbs, throwing chunks of them all over the place. For those, I still prefer the reciprocating saw."
5,Great Christmas gift for my husband.,"My husband just loves to do the yard work now that he has the alligator lopper chain saw. This handy tool is a time saver, and puts less strain on his back. Most of all, I don't have to nag him to keep the weeds down any more. We both love it."
2,Problems with the chain.,"I used this product to cut down four medium size bushes at the front of my house. The first two bushes the product worked great. On the third bush the chain came off. I replaced the chain, after getting oil all over my shorts, since the oil well is on the bottom when you work with the chain. I used the product for about three minutes and it threw the chain again. I continued to put the chain on six times until I just quit and will just dig the rest of the bushes out by hand. I am not happy with this product and I don't have time to stop and fix the chain every three minutes."
4,"""Great piece of equipment""","This is a mini chainsaw that makes cutting larger limbs a breeze. If you've ever had a hard time cutting with regular loppers this is the product you need. Saves time and effort, holds the limb in place and makes cutting very easy."
5,great little tool,"I bought the alligator so I could trim the bushes in front of my home. I have limited hand strength and loppers are difficult for me to use. I have used this tool to trim bushes, cut down small trees, clear a space for an above-ground pool, and then some! I love it! My husband will even use it in place of his chainsaw for small jobs."
5,Fantastic tool,"Easy to handle, powerful tool- I was able to clear branches and small trees quickly and safely. An excellent addition to ""regular"" manual clippers/trimmers."
4,A real time saver...,"""This product has doubled my productivity at the workplace. Now I'm able to do the job in a quarter of the time and do it with more precision!""~Rabbi Tuckman"
5,storm damage,I had lots of tree limb damage because of an area ice storm.There were cracked limbs in the trees and on the ground.The B&D; Alligator lopper did a great job !!!I cut up piles of branches into log size in no time.It's easy to use and cuts limbs up to 4-5 inches with ease.Best purchase I've made in a long time.Good Job Black & Decker
4,Beats manual trimming,"Just finished removing about 3 feet from the top(was about 10 feet tall) of my 80 foot long surinam cherry hedge. Worked as advertised. One minor problem..debris can get caught at the ""chipping ejection point"" requiring manual removal."
5,THE BEST,"This product is the best purchace I have made in a VERY long time. It works, just like it is supposed to! I took it out to my front yard where I have two very wild bushes and went to work. In less than one hour, I now have only one wild bush to get rid of. It cut thru branches at least 3 inches thick. It's THE BEST!!!"
4,Works as advertised,"We have used the Black & Decker Alligator several times since it arrived. We are fighting backinvasive Honeysuckle bush, and it cuts through the trunks like butter. I feel it is safe for my wife to use since there is almost no possible way it can kick back. I do worry about oiling the chain, but so far, so good.I have recommended it to a friend."
5,Great saw; cuts down trees!,"I could hardly wait to get this tool in the mail. I bought this great saw a year ago because I moved into a house that had 2 trees that were over grown in my front yard. The base of the trees were 6 inches in diameter and they both came down with ease. Then the alligator lopper chopped them up like butter. Since the instructions discourage cutting above your shoulders and I've been so happy wtih this product, I'm going to get the B&D Cordless Electric Pole Chain Saw to trim my last tree (tree trimmers wanted $400 to do it and that ain't gonna happen). I would definitely recommend this tool if you are looking for something easy to use, safe to use, and are weary about operating a saw. I now know why men like power tools so much..."
4,Alligator Lopper does the job,"So far we have topped 75 linear feet of Pyramidalis hedge. The best part of the Alligator Lopper is how it holds the branch in place to be cut, not pushing it away like a regular chain saw."
4,chain saw lopper,overall it works well but have had some trouble with jamming with some branches it is very easy to use and zips through most branches for the person with a small cutting job it is a good tool
2,Not so much.,"I devour astrology books, and have a large personal collection which I really enjoy. But this one... not so much.Having read all the amazon reviews, this book was on my ""wish list"" for about 5 months. I finally picked it up after reading Kim Rogers Gallagher's light hearted books, becasue I thought the tone would be similar. I was very disappointed, and I returned it. I found this book to be more annoying than funny... I think Kim Rogers Gallagher is allot smarter and funnier."
5,My favorite astrology book - ever!,"This is a great book that I refer to time and time again. Debbi, please write another book! I love your insight and wit."
5,New Englands Patriot Zipper Bottle Suit,"Great quality. Love the way it looks. Not made for a water bottle, but works great on long necks. Definitely keeps the beverage cold. Love it! Love the Patriots. Go Patriots!"
5,Best history of open source,"A detailed, accurate story of the open source revolution, the best of the bunch."
3,Gift for my father,My father asked specifically for this title. He reports that it's very interesting.
4,Best Book on the History of Open Source,"A lot is discussed in this book, and I'd agree with Eric Raymond's comment that this is the best history of the open source movement. It starts off from Richard Stallman, GNU and ""Free Software Foundation"" and goes to the Mozilla foundation and the new trendy name of ""Open Source Movement."" The best parts are the email excerpts from various mailing lists, which take you back into history when things were still being defined.Of course, most of the book deals with Linux only but isn't that the best case for hackers?"
1,Excruciatingly Poor,"I have rarely starting reading a novel that I have not been able to finish. I could only torture myself into the third chapter of this tedious, incongruous, boring book. Also, the editing and type-setting are horrid. I kept thinking, ""Someone got paid to do this???"" Sadly, I found myself scoffing and rolling my eyes while reading what I suppose the author meant to be serious prose. I picked up ""Walk East on Burnside"" because I live in Portland and thought it would be fun to read something set in familiar environs. I could get more enjoyment from riding around on a Tri-Met bus reading the street signs. At least I would know where I was going. Don't waste your money on this one. Dr. Turco, you need to stick with psychos and criminals. Please don't attempt any more fiction. It is too painful."
2,Science in Traditional China,"This book consisted of speeches made by Prof. Joseph Needham, the contents of which were available for free. In that sense the book is over-priced."
3,DUBBED...,"I have always enjoyed Nino Manfredi,especially in Bread and Chocolate, I missed Cafe Express in the theatres, then moved to NH and was waiting for it to be released someday on DVD, that day came but I was disappointed in the technical quality of the film and the dubbing of Manfredi's voice"
4,typical twenties tunes---twinkling and torchy,"These titles and performances show a fair range (at diffent times and levels)of a star performers development. ""Hello Baby"" done at the beginning of a 10 year ""star"" carreer (her real beginning went back to 1923 in Chicago)compared with her record of ""Ten Cents A Dance"" might lead you to believe you're listening to two different people. Ruth had the good luck to be presented with some of the finest songs of the twenties and thirties the first time around. Of course, to modern ears, the interpretaions are dated (why not?)but the charm and clarity of her voice remain fresh and bright. There were no ""special effects"" here. You're hit right between the eyes with what a ""natural"" can do. Her talent kept her on top for a good ten years and that's no small feat (then or now). If you're a performer, take a chance, listen and you might learn something about what makes for longevity in the business. If you just ache to hear good songs sung well, buy a sure thing."
3,Good quality & construction; poor fit for bucket seats,Good quality and construction but poor fit for bucket seats and it is only intended for front seat. I thought I was buying a pet seat for use on the back of the front seat.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I have a 12 lb Chihuahua mix and she DOES NOT fit in this thing at all. It is a misrepresentation to say it is for dogs up to 20 lbs. It might only be good for dogs up to 7 lbs, if that. The one I ordered was $34.95 + $9.34 s+h from Safe Home Products, Inc. I wanted to return it because I have no use for it if my dog doesn't fit in it. Come to find out they charge a 20% restocking fee. After also paying for the return shipping I will have spent about $55 to get a refund of about $9. DO NOT BUY this product unless you are absolutely sure your dog will fit in it. And definitely DO NOT BUY FROM SAFE HOME PRODUCTS, INC unless you are absolutely sure the item will not have to be returned. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I will be forced to keep this useless item just so I don't get completely ripped off. I'm even wondering if a bag of groceries will fit in it..."
1,Does Not Play CDR's,This will be a terse review as all that needs to be said is that this unit does not play CDR's without skipping & jumping through songs. That's all I have to say about that.
3,screaming meanie 110 alarm,This product is ok. It is definitely loud and wakes my son up. Sounds like a smoke detector alarm. My only dislike is that its more like and egg-timer and you set it for countdown. It doesn't have a current time display so its not like an alarm clock you can set. You need to calculate how many hours in the future you need to wake up (somewhat of a pain). It also needs to be set everyday. It's not the kind of item you can set once and it will keep waking you at the same time. Would not recommend.
4,Another interesting twist in the saga of the Winslows,"If you are a follower of Gilbert Morris and his fictional Winslow family, you will be happy to trace the lives of yet more of this family. This volume covers the career development of three of the clan in photography, nursing and acting careers. Read and enjoy.....pick up a little history on the way."
2,not quite what I expected,"I bought the books hoping to learn something, it was to basic. Not enough detailed pictures or instruction."
2,Not so much about Tantra,"I was under the impression that I will learn about tantric sex techniques. But honestly,I was rather disappointed. It was more like a guideline how to practice porn sex. I have some knowledge about Tantra. It is about tapping into the unlimited sexual energy that resides in us and using this energy to get in touch with our own spirit as well as to connect to our sex partner at the spiritual level. In this way, we get in touch with the Divine inside us and realize it in our sex partner as well. Tantra is ultimately about spiritual awareness. Well, this DVD set is not even close in achieving this goal."
2,Disappointing,"Was disappointed in set. Would not purchase again.The other video I purchased ""The Tantric Secrets of Sacred Sex"" was excellent. It explained the spiritual aspects & emotions of males & females & the basic premise of Tantric Lovemaking. This set was a little Tantric Sex (not lovemaking) & was more like something you would pick up at an adult porn shop.For anyone serious about learning Tantric sex, there are better videos out there."
1,Terrible - Who engineered this P.O.S.?,"I got the bottle of chocolate and pump as a gift. Worked great at first. Then, it quit pumping chocolate. As the bottle was still over 2/3 full of syrup, I realized that the shaft of the pump only reaches 1/3 of the way down the bottle. Really?! Do enough morons really run Ghirardelli that this passes for a decent product?! It's nothing short of remarkable. If it were my company, heads would roll."
1,Doesn't hold its prime,"Simply put, it doesn't stay primed. I had to repump and prime daily --- and BTW, I didn't like the ghiradelli sauce AT ALL.Very disappointing."
5,Georgia on My Mind,"The nation of Georgia is sandwiched between the Black and Caspian Seas. Its rich music came to Western attention with the Nonesuch Explorer release in 1989 of the Rustavi Choir, which set the standard. This particular recording by Ensemble Kereoni focuses on brief folk songs and includes instruments of lutes, double-head drum, and duct flute. The harmony and polyphony of the five men, singing 24 work, dance, love, and ""table"" tunes, is well-engineered and well-performed. This is beautiful and sweet music, even healing. Some arrangments are contemporary or popular, such as track 8, Flower Country; others seem ancient. Whether joyously romantic or seriously religious, whether a soft lullaby or a bright working or drinking song, the music is always interesting and leaves the listener comfortable and happy."
3,An Acceptable Recording Device,"The Philips AQ635517 Cassette Recorder Player is something you can rely on for recording notes and reminders. The microphone is perfect for small time recording. I use it for song writting ideas, if I have an idea for a song that could be good I have something around to use to record it. It is excellent for it size."
4,Good Buy,Candy was packaged nicely and game on time. I have no complaints at all would definitely purchase more product again.
2,Disapointing,"Rarely do we find a unanimity of opinion in reviewer circles. Yet it happened for Lo's Diary. Every reviewer worth his column in the book supplement bashed and destroyed the book. I had to pick it up and read it.The premise seems promising enough, Lolita from her own perspective. Obvious issues in freedom, feminism, etc. This is most obvious, not by what the book says, but by the fact that the book exists. It is carried through in such an unpolished way that you're better off reading straight criticism, or better yet, another Nabokov novel.One wonders, especially after reading Pale Fire, whether Nabokov meant it to be a book about Lolita told by an egomanical Humbert, or rather, what Nabokov meant by it. Questions of betrayed promises of freedom (or whether promises of freedom are always betrayed?) about the silence of the opressed?Still, people don't disappear silently. Want the real Lolita? Read the original again. Save your money."
1,Just plain awful.,"If I were the Nabokovs, I would have fought tooth and nail to keep this travety from being published. While it is true that no one will be able to combine the aspects of beauty and tragedy that pulse it's way throug ""Lolita"" the wya Nabokov so eloquently did, this book doesn't even come close to doing it's legacy justice. Please, don't bother with this tawdry, trashy excuse for a book. Reread ""Lolita"" instead."
1,Terrible,"I'm a huge horror buff and thought this was going to be a lot of fun. Oh my lord, THIS IS B-A-D. If you want to ""choose your own adventure go elsewhere. It's the same thing over and over, and the questions are the same over and over. The story is terrible. The lead actor is terrible. You are better off buying a DVD that is a real campy horror movie. I could go on for days, but you should be shopping elsewhere."
4,It's good to be the queen . . .,"Elizabeth I was a master of applied psychology and manipulation of personalities, juggling with great success for many years the interests of the powerful men who surrounded her. She also had a happy knack for getting the most out of their talents to the benefit of the Crown and the country. Williams, Deputy Keeper of Public Records and a noted Tudor scholar, explores the ambitions, power-bids, marital politics, and ""heroine worship"" at Elizabeth's court and tracks the rise and fall of the Howard, Dudley, and Devereux families in a smoothly flowing, heavily illustrated narrative."
4,Great for heavy iron well water,"I live on a country property with lots of iron and other minerals in the water -- very hard on hair, especially lightened hair like mine. Malibu 2000 has done a great job of keeping down the mineral build up and keeping up my hair color. I like the fresh fragrance and with the conditioner it keeps my hair soft and in good condition."
2,Child sized?,"The hat is nice, but INCREDIBILY small. It was child sized, which was disappointing. It would be better to label it as small."
5,"adults will enjoy, too!",A wonderful collection of infectous songs that kids and parents alike will enjoy over and over again. A great bonus is the commentary that Dan Zanes provides in the liner notes for each song.
1,If you love your child DO NOT buy this product.,"I purchased this product.It is not stable at all.My wife moved the cradle with one hand and it fall down.Thank G'd my son was on her hands and not on the cradle.If you take a look of the proportions you will noticed that the legs are thin and the box is big.In order to have the main part stable there is a metal that you insert on one leg but the other leg, on the other side has no metal so if you move the main part on that leg it falls."
4,Good product.,"Good, sturdy, lasted for 5-6 months (which is good). Only issue is one of the screw got misaligned and it was loose. I would recommend it."
2,Product is alright,"Positives, cradle is easy to put together and it gets the job done for the baby to fall asleep.. Negatives it is very flemsey when I would rock the cradle I realized the screws on the bottom of the legs were always coming Loose causing it to be flemsey and I had to tighten it all the time. I ended buying nuts to put on the bottom 4 screws so it wouldn't get loose and stay tighten, so far so good it's still a little flemsy but it's way better then how I had it before. I would of thought it be way better for the price i paid for it but oh well, like I said gets the job done."
4,"Overall, good product","Baby has not arrived yet, but we are happy with our purchase. Arrived in great shape and assembly was easy. The wheels can go on a little tough, but using a small amount of liquid detergent seems to do the trick. Many reviews stated that the cradle is flimsy. It does move around a bit if you shake it, but no more than any other bassinet or cradle that I have seen. You will need to purchase a thicker mattress as the one that comes with it is just too thin (I was able to pick up a 2"" pad on amazon that fits perfect). The cradle is a bit bigger than I anticipated, but that is not a bad thing. And it is very easy to move from room to room."
4,this book is a must-read story!,If you read this book you must be aware that an open mind is the best kind of mind set for this story. It does take some time to get used to the unique powers of each of the charecters. The actual story follows both the headstrong and stubborn Lenora and the inteligent yet seemingly boring Coren as they are drawn into a world of what looks like profection. In this world they discover that nothing is as it seems and that only they can stop the evil Hevak from causing anymore damage than he's already done. To find out what happens in the end you will just have to read the book and be sure that your ready for a load of surprises.
1,As Cliche-Ridden As His Vapid Daily Column,"Bob Levey claims to care deeply about good writing. But he ignores Strunk and White's admonition that the writer should always keep himself in the background. Indeed, Flaubert once said that the writer ""must be like God on the page, present everywhere yet visible nowhere."" Unfortunately, Levey inserts himself into nearly every one of the chapters (as he does in his insipid Washington Post columns), when it is clear the book would have been decent if he had stayed out of it.This book does have some scarce nuggets. The history of Washington is indeed riveting, but not because of any pedestrian rendering by Levey. Unfortunately, Levey is not qualified to handle the material, and the reader is left only to speculate about how good this book could have been in the hands of a more talented writer."
5,Solved Mac problems!,This adapter solved all kinds of problems I was having with a Prolific adapter on my new iMac. Works like a charm.
1,Couldn't Get It To Work,Couldn't get it to work with the software package I have. Needed for downloading alarm panels and I've never been able to connect using it. Gave up on it and went back to my older computer which works without it.
1,Dead on arrival.,"I received by Keyspan serial adapter. The packaging was fine. THe unit does not work, at all. I followed all instructions. It's dead on arrival. Please help."
4,Easy fix for a complicated problem!,"I use a vinyl plotter/cutter that utilizes a serial port and when upgrading to a new pc, forgot all about it. This device puts me back to work!"
4,Worked well using on-line driver,"I had to get a driver off of the manufacturer's website in order to get this to work (the driver on the supplied CD did not work with Vista.) However once I got the correct driver (there are a lot of them on the website so you need to know exactly which model number you've got) it worked fine. So, not exactly plug-and-play, but it did the job."
1,?? Doesn't work for me,Inspite of all the good reviews no matter what I've tried I can't get my Palm V to sync with my Mac running 10.5.8 There maybe no product that will work for me?
3,Great item; postal service delivery sucks,"I have used this item before and like it very well. I needed this delivered quickly, which is why I chose Amazon, whose delivery times are amazing. Unfortunately, the seller uses the US Postal Service for delivery. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, now they tell me it will be two days from now; my network is completely down and I am not happy, since my WAPs have to be flashed by serial.You should use some other service; the post office is unreliable as to delivery times."
3,Product works as advertised...but planned obsolescence?,"This was just what I needed to hook my Garmin GPS V to my Window$ Vista desktop for map update purposes (I'm a Mac user, but I keep a Window$ machine in the corner.) It works as advertised as a plug and play device.However, one beef...this company deliberately put out a new product, which is almost functionally identical to their earlier USA19Qi - just one chip changed. They withdrew support for their older device by not releasing a Vista driver. Of course HP does it all the time to their scanners and printers."
4,keyspan adapter,This adapter does exactly what it's supposed to do. Don't buy a cheap imitation. It may not work!
4,Need your Mac to talk to your Garmin? You need this...,"Although pricey for no more than it is, if you're trying to get your Mac to talk to your GPS and vice-versa, this works flawlessly. A simple plug-n-play set up plus clicking a few checkboxes (in Networking in your System Prefs, but you know that, don't you?) DON'T make the mistake of thinking you can buy a cheap one on ebay and it will work fine. It will NOT! Spend the bucks and get it right the first time."
3,Good,I am a fan of BHT and this is a good album...could use some more direction and heavy riffs that would make it a commercial success.
5,Bustin' it-- Todd style,"I've been following these guys since '93. I have every one of their albums, I'm that loyal. But I need to do something for the masses on this one, it is SO damned good. Do you want raw Telecaster guitar riffs? A voice that ranges from raspy blues to honeysweet folk? Lyrics driven by melody? And most importantly, an absolutely genius hook on almost every song? Todd writes, sings, and plays together as a package as good as anyone out there. His songs are pure energy, pure life, inspiration. This one will have you feeling good about everything, and especially the gift that is BHTM. Thanks guys."
5,Educational and Fun!,These tornado tubes are a fun way to teach kids about forces of nature. They're really simple to use- screw two 2 liter bottles together with these after filling them partially with water. I always preferred to put some food coloring in just to make it look more interesting. I love that it includes a booklet explaining the scientific principles at work. For added entertainment throw a monopoly house in there!
1,Do you have Windows 7? Dont Bother with this.,This game is so old school that it can't even properly function on Windows Vista or 7. Don't waste your time.
5,What a dream year!!!,"This chronicle takes place some 90 years ago. It narrates all four seasons the author and his new bride spent in Paradise, Mt.Rainier National Park's most popular destination (and aptly named). For those of us that have visited and love this mountain, this book just feels right. If you have never been there, just read it to fall in love with the place. This is a winter book to read with hot cocoa on hand. As a previous reviewer stated; it's like listening to grandpa.Note: The author, Floyd W. Schmoe (September 21, 1895 - April 20, 2001) wrote this book in 1959; the events took place in 1920 (40 years earlier!!!)."
4,"Great, but died after 10 years","(for Altitech I) Very accurate, but of course needs recalibrating each use (barometric pressure based). Eventually the battery compartment froze shut. Accumulated climbing feature very useful."
3,Cute little pan,"It is very light weight and has a thin nonstick coating. I plan to only use it for some birthdays and Valentine's Day, so for that reason it should last a long time. Although it says it is dishwasher safe, I plan to hand wash it. Also don't forget to lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees due to the dark coating. I also own this brand's large muffin tin and it works perfectly with even browning etc."
5,Good investment,"Love this book. It's bigger than I expected. Everything about it was more than expected. And exercises. It's loaded with exercises. This book is a winner if you want to get yourself looking great by using a few sets of dumbells. I especially like that there are a number of different exercises for the same body parts, so you can change, add, take away or rework your routine by changing some of the exercises you do. This book is one big winner in my book. Get it. You won't be disapointed."
2,Many better books out there.,"I'm not sure why this book is so popular. I have read many books on weight training, some written specifically for women, some gender-neutral. I found this book lacking in valuable instruction, limited in its exercises with less than half of the pages actually devoted to the exercises themselves.I will say it has some good basic tips on form and some of the charts in the back are useful. But overall, if you are looking for a good weight training book that will guide you through the beginning phase and keep you interested, motivated and educated, I think there are better books out there."
1,Another Rich Dad Book with the Same Information....,"The Rich Dad company is a money hungry series of authors and salesman, whom are taking all your money. You buy their books (which are most times not bad), but then they elude to buying more of their products and seminars, which are most times from $600 to $5000! Robert K. and his team of advisors are not rich from Real Estate....They hold their wealth in Real Estate. They are rich because of the thousands of dollars that people spend to attend their events and buy their products."
2,Its an attempt,"After hearing the first Matrix soundtrack, I thought Clubbed to Death and My Own Summer would be interesting to hear and faithful to the original. I was wrong.My Own Summer with strings is dreary and somewhat sad, not expressing the shouting anger of the original. The riffs are fit for an electric guitar, not a cello.Clubbed to Death is worse. The sound effects aren't played well with strings. Instead of sounding like a good effect, it sounds like a cat wailing, represented by strings. The bass in the stringed isnt great either. I love the original Clubbed to Death, but this one doesnt sound quite right.It was an attempt, but it didnt work."
2,Here's the secret -,They RUST like a son of a gun! If you have the misfortune to purchase this pan you will need to hand wash and dry it to slow down the rust process. Mine began to show rust after the very first use. After 3 uses it had rust in several of the cups and was too nasty to use. I'm back on amazon to buy some decent Chicago Metallic pans. I'm done buying these disposable cheapies.
5,Easy cleanup,I love the non-stick muffin pan. Clean up is super easy. Just a quick wipe down is needed. These are standard size muffin cups.
4,What you see is what you get,"I needed a simple muffin pan that was nonstick and affordable. This pan filled that requirement, being the least expensive and, upon arrival, showing a quality that was re-assuring. I see no drawbacks whatever and am delighted."
1,Did Not Hold Up,Within a couple of months of installation this kickplate showed corrosion around the screw holes. Two years later the entire thing is a horrible looking mess and needs to be replaced. To be fair I live a few miles inland from the ocean and that may have contributed to the problem. Nevertheless I will not be purchasing this particular kickplate again.
5,"works great, shipped fast",The product has helped my bride w her recurring bladder infections. Daily use has helped more than any doctor prescribed stuff. And it shipped fast and efficiently.
5,Best way to get rid of a UTI is use this product,"This is the answer to a UTI issue. I have always had to rely on antibiotics because I wait too long. This product does the trick QUICK. 1st day I took a tsp of it in pure cranberry juice (no sugar ) 4 times. 2nd day the same. Third day I could tell it was mostly gone but still took it 2 times , Fourth day I was sure it was gone but still took it once. I will never be without this product. If I hadn't had the UTI so long it probably would have been gone in one day."
5,the reviews were right - it's great,"After getting my first UTI and getting really sick (but not wanting to give up that sex partner), I researched and learned about D-Mannose. It works great!My strategy is to take it before an encounter and then again after. If anything feels unhappy in that area of my body, I take it again the next day. I also supplement with cranberry extract the same day and when I can remember it.Now I keep recommending it to all of my friends. Maybe it won't work for everybody, but it definitely works for me!"
1,Not useful for prostatitis,"Took the entire bottle, didn't do anything for bacterial prostatitis. Perhaps my infection is due to another kind than what it might work for."
2,Failed concept.,"I was desperate after not being able to rid of a UTI that was ongoing for 7 days. This is the first time it's happened to me. I did my research and many others found this to be very helpful. I thought it had potential.. until I tried it. I took this sugar 2 to 3 times a day, sometimes mixed with water but usually with 100% pure, disgusting, sour cranberry juice. I felt no different! I gave it 5 days of use before giving up and helplessly accepting anti-biotics from my doctor. This did nothing for me but waste money but you're free to try for yourself."
3,D Mannose 500 milligram,"I ordered this product because I read that it worked for uti. However it took so long to ship that I had to get help before this even came in the mail. It took so long to get it even, that I forgot I ordered it. I never get bladder infections so I don't k.ow if this product will ne helpful for the next time but it's worth a shot."
3,Not bad!,Although this product did take away some of my urinary symptoms I think it is making me gain weight. Has anyone else noticed this as well? Since taking this about 2-3 mos ago I have gained almost 6lbs!!! Might try something else when I am finished with my last bottle. Any suggetions?
2,Made me sick,"I'd been using D-mannose for about 6 months and thought it was wonderful. I get frequent UTIs and hadn't had one since starting D-Mannose. I guest I got a bad batch or something, all of a sudden they started making me really really sick. I took them one morning (fresh bottle) and got violently ill. I took a few days off and felt fine then tried again and the same thing happen. I felt so terrible that I can make myself try again even though it might of just been that batch."
4,D-Mannose,"I have used this product before and it does work for urinary infections, however it has to be used several times a day (3-4) not just once or twice. It's certainly safe and won't interact with medications. It will not work with all types of bacteria the same way, but you don't know until you try it. It's also easier on the stomach than cranberry juice and that's nice if you have stomach issues."
2,Pass - Only for the hardcore,"Love Dane, often listen to his CDs repeatedly at work. Show was ""blah"". Best thing to come out of it was me 'discovering' Gary.If you're a hardcore Cook fan, of course pick this up. O/w even if you love his stand up, it's just not an entertaining show."
2,Poorly packaged,"Of the three DVD's included, the majority of them ran fine, however one of the discs froze up several times. Additionally, the DVD's were loosely packaged in the DVD case and fall out upon opening the case."
5,My favorite Heart Association Book,I have bought later editions and given them away. This is one is still my favorite. I particularly use the baking section. Love the Light Boston Brown bread which is easy to make and also the carrot cake which doesn't have so much oil. Both are made with whole wheat flour. The whole wheat french bread is good also.The paper it is printed on has held up very well over the years unlike the flimzier newer editions.
5,Fantastic Toy!,"Our just turned 5 year old received this toy for Christmas. The majority of his play is with this toy set and Legos; other toys in the play room get his attention maybe 10% of the time. He doesn't follow the directions unless someone older is building with him. He loves to make his own creations then play with them in role play. For instance, he makes different ships (or fighters) and weapons from Star Wars then goes around the house to different parts of the galaxy. These are much easier to put together and especially *PULL APART* (independently) than Legos! The only issue we've had is sometimes he pushes them together pretty hard, so one of the little edges that snaps onto the other piece gets pushed backwards. But we've only had to throw one away. Definitely a great gift!!!!"
5,Nice,this makes a great gift to someone who likes to see how things work! it looked very interesting so i got it as a gift.
3,An Interesting tree,"Its beautiful, but its not as shown on this image. The one in the pic is much brighter than the one I got"
4,Great for a VPort,I ran out of connectors on my TV and realized that it had a VPort on the back. Ordered this and it solved my problem. Excellent video quality and easy to use.
3,nova's comments,The biggest problem with this item is that the battery is not rechargable so when listening to a book and you set it on pause if you cannot go back to the book immediately either the battery dies or the pause goes off and you have to start the book from the beginning. Great for music no good for books
4,great product,"I got this mp3 because my aunt bought me an ipod shuffle, which was fine, except I wanted to be able to tell what song I was on, so I got this mp3. Its the first day ive had it, and ive been happy with it so far. One problem is that the volume control has a lag time, so you might turn it up and it seems like nothing changed, so you'll turn it up more than you need too, and end up blasting your ears out.[ive done it twice]Another problem was that the software wouldnt download, but windows media player works fine. I chose this mp3 because of its price.[and its a good deal!] The radio is a nice feature.The headphones work better than I thought they would. Earphones never stay in my ears, but these never fall out, and have very good sound after you mess with the equalizer. I like the cover. I read other reviews on this product, and they almost all say its hard to get the cover on and off, but I had no problem at all. In all, I'd reccomend this product."
4,"Not great, but works for me.","Tight case and terrible headphones aside, for 81.00 dollars, I was pleased with the product. Using a different pair of headphone I thought the sound quality was good. I stretched out the case alittle and have no problems there.I generally use mp3 that are 160 or higher so I was pleased with the sound.A firmware upgrade would make it a better player. I have contacted sandisk about the upgrade. Hope they are listening.Great for playing audible books on tape (you can use the highest quality file format). Transferring all files was quick and easy. I'm using a 512 mg card that I already owned and can fit tons of songs. The sd cards can be found for low prices if you shop around. All in all for the price I am very pleased with the player."
2,"Great Product, but...","Of all the Mp3 Players I've listened to, this one definately plays the best quality music. Great features and you can easily find the song of your choice.But, there has been a downside. The Mp3 Player automatically shut off on me after only 3 days of having this product. I thought it was the battery, but it was not; I changed the battery several times, but the Mp3 player would not start. A day or so later, it finally worker properly again."
4,Wonderful Sandisk Service,"A couple of months ago I bought this wonderful mp3 player. Of course Amazon's shipping went smoothly and the little thing works like a charm. Recently though I lost my earphones, and thought that I could just go online and buy them. Not as easy as that. I could find them no where and I loved these, they are very comfortable and have great sound quality. So I called up Sandisk Support and they are mailing me a FREE pair. I just really want to thank Sandisk for all their love and support, I think the company is just great."
1,Rip OFF!!,I purchased this Mp3 player a year or so ago. The first time I left it in my care over night when it was between 45-55 degrees. It never came back on. I then returned the product because I had bought the extended warranty so I got a replacement. I then gave the replacement to my father in law. He used it inside and when he went to use it the next day the same thing happened. These are cheap and terrible.
2,works well but sounds terrible,"Trying to play back several files (mp3 at 128kbps or variable 180kbps) there was noticeable distortion at various points in many songs. I don't know if it was just my unit or not, but I couldn't stand it, so back it goes. IAddendum:The Sandisk M240 sounds much better than this one did."
4,Sucked me in and left me wanting more!,"Here's my review of the book ""With this Kiss"". This book drew me in right from the start. Out of 5 stars I would give it 4.5 stars. It would be higher but I wanted to read more about the ending to this story. I wasn't ready for it to end! The characters were believable and real with problems and personality quirks just like the rest of us. They were fun and engaging to read. I will read this one again. Now, can we get a sequel? :) Please!"
1,a disappointment,"it starts out nicely enough. the characters are beginning to develop nicely(1 chapter) but then after the wedding, the little tension just dies and she is just a cold fish who only feels shock and dismay everytime(which is not very many times) he kind of touches her or kisse her finally in the middle of the book and then even when she develops some kind of passion for him,the love scenes are done very callowly,i felt nothing. no emotions, no heart pounding no chemistry. he keeps calling her princess which is really annoying because the conversations are really dull and dry. the whole story seems very dry. that's where i quit reading.this is not a romance book. there is really no romance going on,just them going around trying to find the arsonist. i have never read a romance book that's lacking romance like this one does. waste of time."
4,A great read,I really liked this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves romance novels. I plan on reading more from this author.
5,Beauty and the beast but so much more,It started off slow but once that ball started going it really took off. I've read a couple retellings of beauty and the beast but I think this one is by far my favorite. The charcters were well rounded and easily identified with. Especially the two main ones. And they villain of the piece was someone I had briefly suspected but passed over in favor of another so the big reveal was still a bit of a shock which was nice as well. I hope to be reading more like this from this author soon!
4,Very Entertaining Historical Romance,"I enjoyed With This Kiss very much. I liked both Morgan and Julia; their characters were well-developed and the tension and conflicts they had with each other seemed reasonable given their personalities and attitudes toward life. The plot moved along at a good pace and I was quite surprised about who the mysterious villain turned out to be, which was a refreshing change. As other reviewers have noted, the secondary characters are not as well-developed, but I don't think this is at all a serious flaw in the context of this book."
1,Could of been wonderful,"The heroine desperate efforts to make the hero fall in love with her, is not my idea of a good read. There is enough of that in real life. I like it best when the hero falls in love first, but if both hero & heroine fall in love aronund the same time, I'll take it. But in this book the heroine is inlove from the beginning, and the hero does not fall in love until very late in the story. To me such a story line is a waste of my money and worse my time. I wish there was away of knowing before you purchase a book if the hero was not going to fall in love and/or commit until toward the end."
5,I actually read this,I find I really like this publication. It's got a lot of great articles and I find I look forward to it's arrival every month.
3,Left empty-handed when magazine sold?,"American Photo magazine and Popular Photography were sold to Bonnier Corporation.Bonnier Corporation has acquired five magazines from Hachette Filipacchi Media: American Photo, Popular Photography, Boating, Flying, and Sound & Vision. In February 2011, Scott Alexander became the editor in chief of American Photo. He was previously senior editor at Playboy."
4,"Very useful, very good looking magazine.","While not as technical as the ubiquitous Popular Photography magazine, American Photo is a much glossier monthly with stunning pictures and great advice. For the price, it is worth adding to your list."
1,Terrible.,"I am not one to be disappointed easily, but this was a disaster. I ordered this magazine for my husband for Christmas and it didn't show up for MONTHS! I believe my husband called and that was why they finally sent it. We never did receive all of the magazines that we should have. I should have listened to the other reviews that i read. I guess this is a common problem. I only gave it 1 star because it wouldn't let me give 0."
3,Meh...,Wished I'd known it was only six issues a year. Better coverage and reading in Pop Photo. Or Petersen's. Or the newspaper.
4,The Cheat,"The Cheat is a really Good Book about a couple of friends who find the answers to a mid-term test. Wanting a good grade on it, they cheat. Unfortunately, they get caught and have to suffer the consenquences,but this book has a good moral. I recommend this book for both boys and girls, and I hope you will like it!"
5,IT WORKS,Please get this product. Do not buy from ebay sellers which sell those pirated version which should end up in the dustbin.
1,Works initially then dies,After about of 6 months of very light use - its no longer recognized by any computer; I thought by going for the USRobotics label I was playing it safe but apparently I was wrong. Next time just buy the cheapest along with spares for when they fail.
4,Warm and fuzzy without being nauseating,"I picked up ""Flight Volume Two"" at my library because it looked kind of cool. As soon as I started reading it I was totally absorbed and had to put it down on purpose in order to save some for later. The stories are kind of fairy tale-like, sweet and refreshing but not cheesy and nauseating. This isn't usually my thing, I guess I can be sort of grounded and my literary tastes reflect that. However, this book definately transcends that and appeals to the childlike, unjaded dreamer in me. Yeah, read it!Read especially if your sad or grumpy."
2,Don't start with this one,"I'm a huge fan of Pamplemousse and Pommes Frittes, but this book reads as if written by a committee of ghost writers trying to keep the franchise going. All the usual elements are here, but feel pasted on and contrived...the ""derrieres and one doudoune"" scene mentioned in another review is the perfect example. It's a bit creepy because in all the other books M. P. is the innocent victim of surprise risque encounters, not the perpetrator bordering on a dirty old man. Worst of all, the plot is boring...perhaps it's not fair for me to review since I stopped halfway through. If you're a huge fan, give it a try, since it's part of the series and you might disagree with me. But I'd discourage anyone from starting here...you probably won't pick up the rest, which would be a shame."
3,Dime Novel/Penny Dreadful,"The Prey Novels are similar (in my opinion) to the old dime novel/penny dreadful. I got into them after seeing one of them made into a TV movie for USA (Certain Prey I believe). The main character, Lucas Davenport, is defiantly an antihero; if you're looking for a cop mystery where the cop is a shining example of the law, look elsewhere. Lucas's methods are questionable at times and downright illegal at others. But considering the villains, Lucas is defiantly the lesser of the two evils.The plot of Rules of Prey is predictable; however, John Sandford manages to throw in enough to keep you reading. I'd recommend it as a book to read while on vacation, taking a road trip, or if you just prefer to read novels that you can put down and pick up again later."
2,"Recommended for ""Mr. Macho"" only","Disappointing book! The male characters are superficial and brimming over with mega-macho egos (ie, the main character drives a fancy sports car and has girls falling over themselves to be with him, etc.). The book also has plenty of unnecessary profanity and disturbing violence. If you appreciate quality literature, I definitely recommend that you skip this book!"
4,Rules of Prey by john sandford,"i always enjoy john sandford books and this on is rules of prey. you never know for sure ""who did it"" my husband and i read most of the books, and now are getting them on kindle and from amazon. ot"
4,"Prey Series review - good, fast read","First, I'm reviewing the whole series just right here at the start, no point in going book by book. For a good summary of the series and it's draw, read Chris MB ""CMB"" review (should near the top of the list). I like that explanation of how a tired genre can still work - good characters, not over the top, fast pace.Why I like the series is that each book is new and though the characters grow and change, it's nothing absurd. Also, the problems / villains seem real, not like a comic. But while it's good that the bad guys aren't supervillians, it would have been nice if every now and then one was really smart. I find overall the villains lack depth or flare."
5,Every Lucas Davenport Prey Book Is Just Fun,I started reading this series a few years ago. I started about half way through the series and wound up buying all the previous books. I love how John Sandford is able to bring humr into a book about hunting serial killers. It is a guilty fun read.I recommend all of the Prey Series
5,Reflects the effects and scars of McNamera's poor choices,"This book focuses on McNamera, his journey to the Pentagon, and the effects of his, at first, well intentioned chioces gone bad. Mr. Hendrickson has done a find job of capturing the histories and emotions of several people (from different facets) involved with or affected by the war. These are stories of betrayal, pain, forgiveness and moving on. Being my first book the Vietnam War, Mr. Hendrickson has left me with a strong desire to search out more on the people who were left with physical as well as emotional scars by the war. I now feel that I have a personal attachment to those soldiers, the people who peacefully tried to bring attention to this travisty and and anyone with a single thread of emotion towards to unjust piece of history."
3,Interesting in how one can affect other's lives...,"What makes this book interesting is how one individual can indirectly affect the lives of others and how, on occasion, those lives may inadvertently cross. Hendrickson writes of five lives affected by McNamara's decision to prolong the war.However, the book itself comes across as a bit disjointed due to the author's writing style. It's not for several chapters when the reader finally adapts to his style - this makes the reading somewhat difficult. He also makes McNamara come across as a surreal person, someone in the shadows, someone that may or may not be a real person. I found the chapters on the five - the marine, the nurse, the Quaker, the artist, and the Vietnamese family - to be an overall better read than the rest of the chapters. The final chapter brings finally weaves together the five lives plus that of McNamara. Based on Hendrickson's writing style, I would not read any other of his books."
2,A great concept in search of a great editor,"The concept behind The Living and the Dead is great. Unfortunately, the execution is subpar. The author seems incapable of telling a story in serial fashion. He starts one aspect of a story, only to drop it and move to something else before returning to the original line of inquiry. Much of the book's potential power is lost in the writing style. Additionally, some of the connections the author tries to draw between and among the individuals profiled, the war and McNamara's convinctions are tenuous at best. Heavy use of a blue pencil would have made this work much better"
5,Thoughtprovoking!,"I've had the privilege of seeing Qwo-Li read several times in Seattle. Hir work is groundbreaking and inspiring. This book is a thought-provoking, oppression-ending read -- Powerful on all accounts."
4,I would reccomend this course!,I would reccomend this course! Mine came without a booklet and I have to say Mr. Shaw went over and beyond getting me a book. And the way he uses kid to help is really working for my grand kids.
1,Old card SDR memory almost same as Geforce4 MX 420,"Slow card bad investment, Direct X7 support for old games from 1999.Don't waste your money, Buy Geforce4 4200 or Rodeon 7000 and up"
3,Rainforest Home Remedies : The Maya Way to Heal Your Body and Replenish,The book was written in ( with black ink) and the pages were folded. The cover looked well no creases.
5,It WORKS,"All our neighbors and our backyard seems to have ant hills - every house seems to always have ant issue.When it is hot outside, the ants seems to always find its way into the house to hide from the heat and also get food and water. They just keep coming back and back.Until we bought Ant Control Stake from Home Depot and gave them a try. Initially, ants didn't seems to be interested in those stake and they were busy going after other food on the kitchen counter. Instead of killing those ants off, I decide to put the stake right where they are crawling around. They started to eat off from the stake and amazing, ants got less and less and now they are all gone. And we've not seens any ant for the past 2 weeks. I would definitely recommend you give this a try. They seems to be pet friendly too since we have 2 cats and 1 dog.I will be buying more of those stake in 3 months - maybe even stock up supplies of them."
1,Should have read the reviews before buying,"Like many others are saying, this product made by the same brand used to work GREAT. My family wouldn't buy any other. Now they're just raking in the profits from an old reputation. These stakes DO NOT WORK. They used to, but they've changed something in the ingredients and ants simply ignore them now. We even placed some right in the middle of a row of marching ants and they just kept marching right around and over it. Do NOT buy this thinking that you have used them before and expect them to work just as well now. That's what I did. Complete waste of money."
1,Grant's new products just don't work. Stay away,"The ants completely ignore the new plastic stakes with the new poison.(Grant's must be living on their past reputation) I also bought the Grants powder form to spread around.Have never seen an ant near it. Their liquid bait traps are a little better, but not much. Poorly designed andfor some reason the ants don't like it much. But they go crazy for the large Terro traps, which are very well designed and that very sticky fluid must be the right formula"
1,Did not work for me,I placed it on ant trails but the ants go around it or under it and do not climb the plastic.
1,Awful,This doesn't look like pictured. I got it and it reminds me of Alf. Very disappointed in this purchase. Not worth sending back.
4,A Kid's Review -,"In this book a boy named Charlie is told by his Teton Souix friend that ravens can cure. He decides that this could help his grandfather, who is slowly dying. He takes a baby raven from its nest, and brings it home to his grandfather's house. He later starts a list, so that he can decide whether the ravens are ""good"", ""bad"", or ""mysterious"".I think this book was quite good. The story was fun and the characters all had very interesting personalities. I have read better books, though because there isn't much action in the book. I think this a very good book to read if you like science and/or animals. I would suggest this to a 5th-6th grader."
2,Dust Cover,"it's a dust cover. Buy a real gig bag if you plan to gig a lot. Think about it this way. If you bought 6 of these, you would have invested in a really really nice gig bag."
1,I hate things that cause my computer to hang up.,"I shut down everything like I should and started the installation process. There came a screen that indicated ""installation shield"" and a note requesting patience because it would take a while. Everything was going nicely for the first few minutes and then it froze my system (Windows XP)and there was no way out but to turn off the computer.That's it Corel; One strike and you are OUT!!! The package is in the mail heading back to Amazon."
5,beautiful!,"I realized that one reason I got more depressed in winter was the lack of color in environment, also less time outdoors. So this dvd is beautiful way to bring in color, beauty of nature into your home, no matter what is going on outdoors. can ""visit"" glorious scenery.Is one of the most beautifully done nature dvds I have seen."
1,Useless,Both units showed power but were dead on arrival. Using a new clean install with Win XP. Bought 2 I Rocks units for a few dollars more plugged them into the same system and they operated (and still are) very smooth. Listen to the reviews (I did not) Sabrent is not worth your time.**** Amazons return policy is great !! You cannot ask for any better response than I received !!! ****
1,bad power supply,Mine arrived with a non-working power supply. The whole thing quickly went into the trash and I bought a RocketFish instead.
5,I Like Mine ...,"I bought this product to rescue my stuff from a crashed PC and transfer it to a MAC. It is and does exactly as advertised. Mine did work with the HD jumper in the ""Master"" position per the instructions. It was set to ""Master"" when I rescued it from the PC. Otherwise, I would have retained the original setting for the first try.The instructions do say to spool the disk up to speed before making the USB connection and this is necessary.My only problem was with the screws. The screws for the faceplate are a very slightly different size than those that secure the HD in the case. It took me awhile to figure that one out with my 65 year old eyes.Reading these reviews before purchasing was a plus as well."
2,hard drive is not secured,This product works but there are no screws to secure the hard drive to the enclosure. The hard drive is free to flop around inside the enclosure while traveling. The hard drive slips into the enclosure with about 3/16 to 1/4 inch clearances on all sides. This is a poor design.
4,Great Product at a cheap price,"bought this about a week ago and has been great so far, i must admit the quality of the casing isnt the best ( may break if it falls) however it gets the job done and is easy to setup. It isnt as slim as it says but is still quite good"
2,Up to 400GB??,"My 20GB IDE hard drive installed easily, but when I tried to format the drive it would only format in FAT32. When I tried copying data to the device, it dropped out after only 126MB and now gives write errors when I try to add more files. Breaking the drive up into several smaller logical partitions may solve the issue, but at 126MB per drive letter you would only be able to use 3GB of drive space."
4,Good Enclosure for the price,"I was looking for an affordable enclosure for a hard drive I salvaged from an older computer. I found that for the price, this enclosure was perfect. It was easy to install and operate. So far I have not had any issues with the use of this enclosure. I must admit the overall construction is somewhat ""economical"" and appears to be delicate. However, for my purposes (the occasional backup of data and pictures) the unit works great. This was a perfect option that allowed me to salvage a 40 G hard drive."
4,"Works great, can get hot","Arrived quickly and easy to set up. I knew before I bought it that it didn't have a fan and overheating could be a problem. But I'm using it just for a spare drive that I will be using mainly to back up photos, music, videos, etc so it will get very little long term use so the lack of fan isn't a problem. I may still drill a few holes in the case though. But if you plan using your drive for long periods, I would look at a case with a fan."
2,"It works, but only after I glued it back together.",The enclosure arrived broken. The plastic that connected the board to the end of the enclosure had broken. It wasn't worth the trouble of returning so I got the gorilla glue out and glued it back together. Next time I'll spend a few more dollars and get something better.
4,Good replacement case for the money,"I bought this to replace a case I had with a bad connector. Installation was quick and very easy. It even came with a screwdriver to make the installation even easier. The only thing I wish was a little different would be to have the LED's on the front of the case instead of the back where the cables come out. But overall, for the money, an excellent replacement."
4,A Solid Choice,"I bought this hard drive enclosure because I had an old 3.5"" IDE Western Digital Hard Drive that couldn't be used internally in my new computer that uses SATA connections. So far it seems that I made a good choice to help me convert the old hard drive to an external hard drive. The directions for assembling the enclosure around the hard drive weren't very clear, but then again you really don't need the directions either. It took less than five minutes to put it together.It comes with everything you need including the power cord and the USB 2.0 cable. Just plug everything in, flip the power switch on the enclosure on, and your computer should read the drive.One warning, this enclosure doesn't have a cooling fan, so it's not meant to be left on all the time. Just turn it on when you're using it and turn it off when done."
2,It works. It's cheap. It's poorly designed!,"The designers must have been heading out for the weekend when they approved this one!The gizmo that holds the case upright fits loosely -- not so badly that you'll lose it when you lift it, but it slides right off when pushing/pulling the case into place. I would magic-glue it to the case, but what if I want to lay the case flat next week?The power switch is located on the back (normal), but it is 2/3rds of the way down the plate and you have to reach down/passed the USB connection to get at it. The power switch is also a pop-out, which it will if you don't tuck the interior wiring smartly to the side.Then there's the power light. Guess where that is -- on the back! -- where you can't see it! Yeeuch!"
4,Works good for the Price,Bought 3 of these for $16 each. The fit is tight. Difficult getting the end cap on but once its on they have all worked fine. If you like to swap hard drives in and out of cases this isn't a good one as the end cap has two tabs with a bump that you press down and fits in the hole un the case to secure - as I said the fit is tight and it takes some pressure and patience. Once installed they work fine - they don't run hot. For under $20 it's a good buy.
2,"First one was bad, second worked just fine","The first unit I ordered was defective. The IDE hard drive ribbon cable was torn half way off the connector and there was a loose plastic piece that had fallen off. Fortunately Amazon returns are easy and the second unit worked just fine.This doesn't do anything to quiet the HD and it can get pretty warm so I wouldn't recommend using it all the time, but if you just need to temporarily use an external drive this unit is ok."
3,Decent no frills product,"This is a decent enclosure. No frills for sure, but does the job. Took a little fiddling to get it to work properly, but once it was connected it worked without a problem."
4,Great read,"I never take the time to write reviews. I do however, know what makes a great read. Mr. Grover has captured the true nature of a good piece of fiction. I would have given this work 5 stars, but it needed to be longer, which was one of only flaws I found. I would encourage readers to pick this one up, and, I can't wait for future work of Mr. Grover.TC"
2,why so crumbly?,I loved these crackers when I was growing up. Why are they so crumbly now? Useless! Makes a mess every time I open the sleeve....
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I liked a number of the other albums in the Pickin' on series, but this one doesn't seem to have gelled the best. There are a couple of good ones in there I guess. I recommend cherrypicking the ones that sound good rather than buying the whole album."
2,Uhhhh...no!,"Being a die-hard Metallica fan, I can appreciate tribute albums, I do like the majority of them. I love Apocalyptica, which is Metallica on Cellos. But this is just terribile. The whole bluegrass thing totally detracts from the tone of the songs and just sounds ridiculous. I only gave it two stars because of the musicianship, which is...professional. That's all I can say. A tribute album is great when it can put a new spin a tune while staying true to the originl's tone and feel. Here, there is none of that."
1,"True Story: Murder, Memoir, Mea Culpa",Micheal Finkel wrote a story portraying honesty and true memoir from only the murderer! It is written with the lies and deceit from Christian Longo who is a liar and con man as proven in court. He should have portrayed the truth about Mary Jane and her three beautiful children. Christian was too proud to accept public assistance for his family but he certainly was not to proud to accept a public defender in order to save his own worthless self! Micheal Finkel made an enormous amount of money on this book and has yet to offer one red cent to the family who went into great debt to bury the family Christian murdered. I am sure Christian gets something in return for the story. How right is that? I hope Mike Finkel writes the story on The Death of Christian Longo. May he really have a story to tell about suffering and pain while he waits for the lethal injection that kills him!
5,"The perfect ""Before you go to Bed"" Book","I picked this book up at a bookstore, knowing that I needed something to read before I went to sleep. BOY was I up late with this one. This was a great read. The story was fun, interesting, and hard to put down. Definitely read this book before you go to bed. A++++++++"
1,"Desire for love, love of desire","I can't believe that that this book is presently ranked at 3 and 1/2 stars. While I realized that it wouldn't be Kafka, it was a frightening book even for fluff. It actually makes the perfect companion for the more academic book ""The Elusive Embrace"". The idea of ""desire for love, love of desire(lust)"", which is explored in ""The Elusive Embrace"", is perfectly illustrated in this shallow tale of modern gay existence. It is nauseating how often the protagonists gloats that now, ""cured"" of AIDS, he is gorgeous and can be both object and subject of desire. He abandons his boyfriend, who had cared for him when he was sick, and embarks on a joyride of drugs and sex. While the nicely packaged ending sees the protagonist return to his old flame, it's sad that Harrison has to work out and buy new clothes in order to win back his old boyfriend. The book extols materialism and appearances over virtue and scoffs at the threat of AIDS."
3,Decent Stool,"The stool is overall good construction and has small cork coasters on the arms but the stool is prone to tipping forward when you try to sit on it so be careful. once your are sitting it is fairly comfortable, has foot rests and is fairly lightweight so overall it is a decent stool."
3,Highway 61-Soundtrack,"Kinda meh, only a couple of standouts on the soundtrack. A bit dated and corny-would only give it two stars if not for the two or three tracks that I really enjoy."
5,Wonderful Concert DVD,"I loved this DVD because not only did it show the entire concert, but it also included a documentary that showed the boys preparing for the concert, what it meant to them, and what they did after the concert. It enabled me to become more familiar with their personalities and to see how genuinely they care about each other and their fans. I only recently discovered them (in October) and I will be a fan for life. They sing music that can span generations, with no foul language, and with beautiful voices. I think they are great!"
4,A Sci-fi Banquet,It's wonderful when there are several sci-fi movies in one package. And this one had a whopping SIX! Each one has its own DVD so you can always choose the one you enjoyed the best and not have to look at them all. This proved to be a good advantage. Try not to take the movie too seriously; you will enjoy it better. Its meant to be entertaining and it is for the most part. Happy viewing!
2,Poorly designed text,"Content is not well organized, the text is confusing and the publisher used the smallest font possible (I think they were trying to save paper, I couldn't believe they could print text that small:). The content could be useful, but the layout and design of the text is so user unfriendly it's a struggle to get through."
4,Prints well but sometimes jams,"This prints faster and better with less expensive ink than my older, cheaper HP printer (a 1500 series). However it still occasionally grabs a sheet of paper and crunches it, resulting in a paper jam. You have to remove the rear panel to get at the paper to remove it."
4,"A good little printer, for the price","We bought this printer because we wanted an HP printer to go with our HP computer. Also, we wanted a printer that could print on DVD-R's and CD-R's. The printer functions well. The only issue I have with it is that it does not print photographs to the same quality as my Dad's more expensive Epson all-in-one. I'm sure the price difference has a lot to do with that. For the price, this is an excellent computer. We've had ours for over a year and have never had any issues with it."
2,Wish I had read these reviews before purchasing...,"While it actually does work with my Mac, I've had nothing but trouble with this printer since I got it. The reason I bought it was to print CD's and DVD's. That's a nightmare, if you can get it to do it at all. I constantly have to realign the print-heads and clean the thing and every single time I go to print, it tells me I either have a paper jam or no paper at all! Can't afford a new one and the warranty is worthless, so I guess I'm stuck with it..."
2,Buggy Software and Lame Tech Support,"If you are planning on using this as a networked printer you might want to look to another brand. The printer itself is fine but the HP Networking software is buggy and causes error messages when you shut down Windows (both XP and Vista).I tried the Email support and went round and round with them. Their solution was to uninstall then reinstall the software. When that didn't work, their next suggestion was to uninstall then reinstall the software. When that didn't work they had me download a software update, then uninstall and reinstall the software. When that didn't work....do you detect a pattern here?They can't even tell me how to assign a permanent IP address for the printer USING THEIR OWN SOFTWARE!"
1,"2 tries, 2 failures","I've been through 2 of these, and tried installing on two different PC's. I guess I just ended up with 2 bricks.One major annoyance: software installation takes forever and a day with a decent speed computer. I'm running XP Pro with a 2GHz processor and 2.5GB ram, and this took like 25 minutes to install. Glad to see it didn't work.If the thing worked like it was supposed to, I'd guess I'd be pretty happy. Guess it's back to shopping.UPDATE: Although it didn't have the capability to print to CD's, I ended up going with the C5180 instead. Network ready! That held more importance than being able to print to discs. No issues installing it, and so far it's working great. Wish I'd gone with this one instead of the 5280 right from the get-go. It would've saved me about 5 hours of BS'ing with junk."
1,Not for use with a Mac,"After reading mixed reviews about using this machine with a Mac I called HP and was told it would work with a Mac, "" no problem"". After receiving the machine and found it would not work with a Mac, I again called HP and was told ,""well it will sorta work with a Mac if you don't want to use all of the machines features, some of them will work and some won't."" I returned it to Amazon for a full refund. Five stars for Amazon , Zero stars for HP."
3,Don't buy for use with Windows 7!!!,"This looks like a very nice printer, but we bought it to go with a new HP computer we just bought which is running Windows 7. It appears that there are no drivers available for Windows 7 (just XP and Vista). It scans wonderfully, fast and very clear, but after a month on line with HP support, and their escalating to higher level support, we are still not able to print with it."
3,Spend a lot of money on ink,This printer prints great pics but spend a lot of money on ink. I haven't printed much more than the average person but i estimate i print about 40 4x6 and have to replace my cartridges!
1,"Slick Design - Mechanical Nightmare, Photosmart C5280","The HP Photosmart C5280 has a nicely designed exterior, and provides an excellent human interface, with clearly labled buttons and color function screen. The real problem with this unit is its poor mechanical performance. I am surprized to read any positive reviews, and must draw the conclusion that either the reviewers did not use the printer over a long period, or I simply have a lemon. Problems:- Error message says ""Print Cartridge Alignment Failed"", CD and web site offer no solution for this failure.- Printer screen reads ""Printer in Use"", after print is complete and must be rebooted tp reset.- Absolutely eats print cartridges. They are expensive and very low volume.- If the unit is off for more than 48 hours you must ""Clean Print Cartridges"" or your printing will be spotty & incomplete.In conclusion I am going to trash this unit and buy an alternate make & model."
4,Lots of features for a good price!,"We just bought this to replace our old HP All-in-One. Printers have come a long way in just a couple years. It prints quietly and quickly with excellent quality.The CD/DVD printer option is a nice add-on not usully found in this price range.But the photo printer option is where this printer really excels. Pop in your memory card and the LCD screen will allow you to view, sort, and edit the photos on your disk. You can crop rotate and reduce red-eye, all on the printer itself. The photo quality isn't as good as a stand alone printer (I'm going to hold onto my Kodak Printer Dock for now) but it is certainly one of the better inkjets I've used.All-in-all, this printer does a lot for the $150 price tag!"
1,Not good for my hair,"I have pretty thick hair and I loved the smell of this shampoo. I was really excited to use it and hoped it would give my hair shine and health. Unfortunately, after spending $15 and using it twice, I am tossing it. My hair is extremely greasy because of it. It looks like I put oil in my hair and left it... even while blow drying! I am disappointed."
1,not a professional title,a researcher should be professional in the terms he used specially for the title of his research book . there is no arabian gulf anywhere in the world. the correct name is Persian Gulf. United Nations says so.
3,Just OK,"This tea is just OK. It doesn't taste like pumpkin. It tastes like spices like a few other people have mentioned. Nutmeg is the main taste. This is fine for a ""holiday"" type tea but I won't be purchasing anymore.I prefer Bigelow's Pumpkin spice tea for a pumpkin tea."
1,Tastes Like A Incense Store,"Knowing that I love all things pumpkin, a friend gave me this as part of a gift basket. I brewed it up one Saturday morning and took a sip....and immediate images of incense crossed my mind. You know...those bags of rose petals and spices that people toss into their underwear drawer or bathroom cupboard to help things smell better? Yes, those. Definitely NOT my cup of tea. Ugh."
5,"Gimme, Gimme, Gimme: the true Spirit of Christmas","This is absolutely an every year must watch film.....From the opening song: ""Gimme, Gimme, Gimme"" to the closing credits, this is what a perfect little Christmas TV show looks like.The sentiment of the holidays is captured, and everything that Christmas is about is here.Light the fire, pop in the tape, (no DVD yet) and curl up with someone you love.Merry Christmas"
2,NEVER GOT IT,I DID NOT GET THE CD THAT I ORDERED. I HAVE EMAILED AMAZON AND THE SELLER WITH NO RESPONSE FROM EITHER. I AM DISPUTING THE CHARGE TO MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY AND I AM NOT BUYING FROM AMAZON AGAIN. I'M SURE THIS WILL GET NO RESPONSE EITHER. EXCEPT MAYBE TO BE PULLED SO IT WON'T REACH THE PUBLIC. ROY
3,very good effort but....,"I really enjoyed this CD and just want to compliment Michael and the producers to keep this musical tradition going. having said that, i must wonder, did Michael break any new grounds? the answer sadly is no. i think a i get a deeper and more seasoned musical from the likes of Tony Bennett, Mel Torme and of course Frank, chairman of the board. i hope michael continues to work hard and explore new grounds. my best regards and wishes for him."
5,Michael Buble,He is a wonderful crooner and I love music of all sorts but Michael's crooning voice just makes you feel warm all over.
5,Great CD,"If you like Michael Buble music, you'll enjoy this one. Fast service, and no problems with the CD. I think the price was good, too."
5,This is great music,I don't know about you but if you are over 35 the music pickings are pretty slim. Not anymore - It's Time is a great CD. I listen to it over and over again. I have even turned some friends into fans. I reommend this CD.
5,Michael Buble It's Time,Michael has developed his own style with this album. His voice is so outstanding that I believe he has the ability to sing anything. I love this album as I did his first two albums.
5,i love this album!!!,my friend had this album playing in his car.....even after a week it just wouldnt go out of my head. after searching on the internet for forever (i had no idea who it was) i finally found it. now everynight i go to bed listening to it. i just love it!!!
5,Wow! Bubleboy has it and shows it,Bubleboy has it and shows it and brings it. Great sounding voice.I listen to Bubleboy all day and never tire of this cd.
5,Where the heck have I been,"I just heard this guy for the first time today.WOW.knocked me off my feet, Holy Cow. I love this guys voice. I am totally won over. Gonna buy everything he has put out so far!!!"
5,A Voice Like Silk...,"Michael is one of the best male vocalists of my generation...I can say that with conviction as I have seen him live, in concert many times...Michael has managed to make each track on this album his own.By doing so, he has brought Jazz music back to the forefront of modern music. No easy task, I know. I love the fact that Michael is not trying to be Frank or Bobby or Dean. Michael is Michael and that is plenty for me..."
5,Exceeding my Expectations.,Michael Buble's newest cd has exceeded even my high expectations!His energy and vocal styling is second to none and each trac showcases his amazing talent.The hit song named Home that Buble wrote is unquestionably Grammy consideration calibre.My rating for this cd is a full 5 Stars+.
3,Almost Great,"I don't think this album is as good as some of his earlier stuff. Also, my cd doesn't play in my computer cd drive."
2,Buble but....,"His voice is sweet and sultry but the words that he's singing aren't meaningful at all. The sound and production are there but it seems they've taken a young man with a great voice and he has no real emotion to express. If listening to bellows of nothingness coming through the speakers is your idea of a good time then by all means get this album. If not, look for someone who actually has something to say."
4,Smooth sounds,"If you are a Michael Buble fan, then this one is for you. He has the smooth sounds of the 50's, easy listening music."
3,"Just like their ""DJ"" Set....","Well the Outernational Sound has come around. And if you caught their DJ Sets from the ""Richest Man"" tour,(not the live set w/ band), then you may have an idea of what you are in for. For me it boiled down to this: Good Music, Bad Mix. But I've come across this many times...Great producers that aren't so good at DJing. Kind of dissapointing, but there is still some musical gemms on this disc...."
2,no effect,"I've been taking these pills for hot flashes for several weeks but there has not been a change in my symptoms. My sister swears by them that's why I gave it two stars. However, I still have numerous flashes. Save your money and don't buy this product."
4,Fun!!!,"I started this DVD once and stopped it because the warm up seemed SOOOO slow. This weekend, I had some extra time, so gave it another try. While I may not burn as many calories as with, say, a Turbo Jam video, but it's a lot of fun and one I can see keeping in my rotation."
3,Pretty good,"This album is pretty good, featuring some great songs by Michelle Tumes, Sierra, Janna Long of Avalon, Susan Ashton, and Christine Dente of Out Of The Grey.Susan Ashton opens the album with ""Wonderful, Merciful Savior"", which is the best version I've yet to hear anyone do. It's beautiful.Janna Long, then recognized as Janna Potter, gave a lovely performance on ""Savior, Like A Shepherd Lead Us"".Sierra, Nichole Nordeman, and Michelle Tumes make the album hauntingly significant with their songs, making it a worthwhile purchase.Susan Ashton ~ Wonderful, Merciful SaviorChristine Dente ~ Nothing But The BloodMargaret Becker ~ How Can I Keep From SingingTwila Paris ~ He Leadeth MeKim Hill ~ Only By GraceCheri Keaggy ~ Blessed AssuranceJanna Potter ~ Savior, Like A Shepherd Lead UsSierra ~ O, The Deep, Deep Love Of JesusNichole Nordeman ~ A Song Of PeaceMichelle Tumes ~ What Wondrous Love Is This"
1,The fish tank sucks,"I purchasewd this fish tank for my husband for Xmas. We were out of town for Xmas until the first week in Jan. We set up the fish tank at that time. This week, Feb 4th the fish tank took a dump. Completely quit working. I called Brands on Sale to see about replacement and was told I was sol because it had been over the 30 day replacement time, when on paper that may well be, but it wasn't even used 30 days. I wouldn't reccomend this company to anyone and I will never purchase anything from them again!!!!!"
1,More Frenetic Than Funny,"Gee, this book is like watching a sitcom - and not a particularly funny one. Maybe it should come with a built-in electronic laughtrack. I give it one star for trying so hard."
4,One of the Funniest Ever,"I read this several years ago. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read. I suppose you could call it gay fiction, but that's too small a category - and really doesn't matter. It's just damned funny. Which is what you would expect from one of the writers of Frazier. If Frazier and Niles weren't brothers and were gay and a few IQ points slower, this would be their story. Enjoy."
1,A total waste of money.,"It's a white bulb with a yellow tinted plastic cover. I somehow ended up with more bugs than before when I was using a standard soft white incandescent bulb. I hear the florescent that are actually yellow work much better, so I'd suggest going that route. This is a total waste of money."
1,The Kakuro breaks all the rules,"I purchased this game for the Kakuro part, since there are several other available Sudoku games. The puzzles don't follow the rules of Kakuro, so it's virtually unplayable. There should never be a point where you can only get the answer by sheer guessing; you should always be able to work out the number given all of the other clues. You might have to temporarily guess but by following that path you should be able to verify or disprove your guess.The interface is, um, unique, but it is useable. I wouldn't have given it one star for that. It lets you operate with the buttons rather than the stylus and it takes a bit of getting used to."
1,Ugh..Are you kidding?,"One honestly has to wonder if the makers of this game have ever played sudoku. The game doesn't allow you to make small notations, just fill in the answers. The small notations solve the puzzles! Ridiculous."
2,Frankly...,I found this butter to be very waxy. Therefore I do not feel the quality compares with the price.
2,Did they run outta cash...?,"The biggest male R and Bee performer since 'any' preditor type currently on the charts (or in the courtroom) put out this long form video earlier 2005, and with all that is going on in the world--ridiculous gas prices, kids getting killed in our streets and in Bagdadian streets, global warming--all he has to offer is some slick choreography and booty chasin'...? What!?!? The mysterious lady busting the ballers is allegory for...? Was she an alien? Can you give me more plot here? Plus, I've seen better creep outs in the tongue in cheek 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'. (As an aside: Usher's idol paid 7 million dollars to put together 'Scream' the video and they're still playing it on VH-1 some 10 years after...) To this DVD's credit it has all the videos from his monster hit, last year's Confessions and a bonus CD with new, rare Usher tunes."
2,Had this for a while...,"At the time I bought this device it was decent and works well with Windows *XP*. Which is fine, as that was what was on my laptop at the time. However, I will tell you this device will NOT work with Windows 7 and the company is now out of business. It's an orphaned product. Don't buy anything from Deluo as you will no longer get support for it. (That's likely why most of the Deluo hardware is now half price from most sellers).For those of us that don't mind using Linux (or Unix derivatives) the Deluo USB GPS devices are supported with gpsd and using the '-n' option (turns off gpsd device write support)."
2,DeLuo GPS - Watch Out,"Be careful. I have found DeLuo unreachable for weeks. Their web site is gone or non-responsive, I fear the company is too. This unit does not work on Windows 7 and I have been unable to locate a working driver. While I have heard good things about this unit (made by Sony)I can't recommend it for Windows 7."
1,there are what there are $,there ok for the $ ty nickthere are like they said sport climbing lanyard!im to big for them i am 225lbs.
4,Very Spiritual,"This is a nice little book,a quick, and easy read.However, I thought it would talk about drumming for health.I was a bit dissapointed that it didn't.The overall tone of this book is very spiritual,which surely is not a problem,but I had assumed that it would cover topics related to how using a drum for healing can benefit one's mind and body.....Not just their spirit. I have ordered something else, which I hope will deal mostly with the medical aspect of the drum.Again,if you are really looking for a great ""spiritual"" drum book, this one will work well for you!"
4,"Delightful, varied, complex yet energized.","This is a collection of 17th Century instrumental music from Italy. My favorites were the many pieces where viola, lute, mandolin, and guitar predominate. Several pieces in the collection also included harpsicord, which I found to be less 'light on their feet', more structured, than the works where lute, guitar, and mandolin predominated.The works are varied with Scarlatti, Rossi, Vitali, Strozzi, Bassano, Rognoni, Matteis, Pasquini, and Arrigoni. I was unfamiliar with most of these composers and welcomed the introduction.The works also vary in length with some pieces a delightful 1:21 minutes to the final piece at 12:33 minutes.The more I listen to this CD the more enchanting it becomes."
5,Speaker Stands,I purchased this Speaker stands a while back and was waiting to give them some serious usage. They are sturdy and very well built. They have fallen many times to the floor (I got 5 kids) and it's like nothing happened to them. Very good quality and a little later I'm thinking about buying another set for the front speakers.
4,Decent Stands,"Stands don't put together incredibly well. The rubber seal which connects the two pieces sort of crunch up when put together. Once assembled, they have a good weight and mount any speaker. I was able to put my giant speaker cable through them too."
4,Great Ending,A contest causes a boy to enter his Christmas wish that his mother would have a boyfriend. His entry was selected because it was a great human interest story for the company's ad campaign. Many twists and turns in the hunt for a suitor and later a fiance came to a surprise climax.
1,A Christmas Wish,Total tripe. All the obligatory feel good moments of a Christmas movie without plot line or character development behind it.
3,"Typical Hallmark - sappy storyline, happy ending","While this story is realistic in the broken family, homeless vein, how a whole town instantly falls in love with the main character is a bit of a mystery. I mean she seems very nice and she has a sad story but she suddenly converts the town grouch, the cop falls for her the instant he sets his eyes on her, and everything falls neatly into place at the end. I know that Hallmark likes sappy and happy but not a lot of substance here with the ending already predetermined in the first 15 minutes. Talk about dropping hints - anvils were falling every ten minutes! You could see the whole root beer storyline coming a mile away."
5,A Christmas Wish,Gave this as a gift to a friend and she loves it. Shipped very quickly. I know this will be a wonderful edition to her DVD collection
4,Angie's Review,Great ideas for early childhood bulletin board! There are photo copies in back of book to copy for board. Having these photo copies saves time in trying to find pictures or boarders for the board.
3,"A nice ""Sweet Soul"" rare oldies compilation.","It's definitely wonderful to have these 16 obscure soul ballads on CD and you will definitely savor and enjoy the sweet sounds of The Ethics, Starbright, The 11th Commandment, The Whispers and The Whatnauts. My only complaint is that the songs by Linda Jones, Mike and The Censations, The Natural Four and Timothy Wilson sound terrible (as they were transferred from poor-quality vinyl sources)- that aside, this is just as enjoyable as this series' first two volumes."
3,Interesting novel with a few problems,"I enjoy reading Cemetary World, but it's a book with definite weaknesses. It's written in Simak's style, but I think it goes too far in retaining a midwestern USA sensibility to people born 10,000 years in the future. The technology is 1950s sci-fi, using little in the way of imagination or vision and it sometimes took me out of the story. Still, it's a compelling idea and I do like the book, just not as much as other Simak novels."
1,A publishing scam - don't waste your money,I'm asking for my money back. There's almost nothing in the book about the porn industry. It's the experience of an uneducated woman's job as an editor in the business but her perspective is so limited that she could be talking about any business. It's 200 pages - large font and double spaced. One look inside and you'll know you've been scammed. Doesn't Amazon have some responsibility to its customers not to shill such books for publishers? This is my second experience here of paying a premium price for a highly touted book that ended up being ludricrously misrepresented.
4,Picture not the same as tool,The tool I received is not the tool pictured in the sale add.Mine does not have any of the cushioning that the picture shows.The tool itself is alright but I was expecting it to be the same as the picture the ad showed.
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I wore out 2 of these drill`s(factory new) in 6 month`s time during residential construction projects. Although i agree this is a comfortable drill to use, it is definitly one for lighter usage."
1,Start smoking after a month of use,I would never buy another one of these drills. This was a waste of time and money.
4,"Short, but thorough, overview of parent/ECE program relation",The chapter on parent education compares (and complements) Kevin Swick's STRENTHENING PARENTS AND FAMIILIES DURING THE EARLY CHILDHOOD YEARS. It includes lots of citations for further reading in the primary texts.
3,Does not work with Sprint 3585 and 3588 phones,"I ordered this thinking that it would work with my Nokia 3588, as the description states that it works with ""3500"" series phones. However, when I got it and plugged it in, it wasn't working. I looked at the packaging and noticed the little asterisk stating that the earset does NOT work with the 3585 (and, apparently, the 3588). So now I have to return it. Ah well. I'll probably get the one with the 2.5mm universal jack. I'm giving it a three, because I've used these earpieces in the past and they've tended to be pretty good."
4,best tool for parents,You can use this to control your child's behavior.They love these animals and want to do it 24 hrs a day!
5,Wonderful,"This is an amazing album. I am a first time Andrew Bird listener, and to describe him I would say to cross Radiohead with the vocals of Jack Johnson and lyrics that could only come from a brillaint mind like Bird's. I'd say buy it."
4,"Good, not great, Minus 5 album","Though McCaughey says that this is, in many ways, closer to what he'd originally envisioned for Let The War Against Music Begin, I think I prefer that album to this one. Many of the songs on this not-quite-an-outtakes-collection disc plod along. The trademark McCaughey strangeness is present (Submachine Girl begins with the line ""She started the grade-school dogchew craze""), but the songs are slow and melancholy. Some of that is fine, but the album, as a whole, is a downer. It makes a good companion/contrast to In Rock, and it has some merits (excellent harmonies and solid songwriting, as always), but it's too much of a downer."
4,AN EXCELLENT CD,"THERE IS SUCH A THING AS A GREATEST HITS THAT INSTED OF HAVING HITS ON IT, IT HAS HORRIBLE SONGS. THANKFULLY, THIS CD ISN'T ONE OF THEM. EVERY TRACK IS VERY GOOD AND THERE AREN'T (IN MY OPINION) ANY BAD SONGS ON HERE. IF YOU'RE A FAN THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE."
3,good looking but not sturdy,"I was glad when I found this modern looking toddler bed for a reasonable price. I loved the storage drawer. However I noticed quickly that the wood is too soft and there are a lot of scratches. I have no idea how my kid made them . The screws get loose all the time for some reason. The other day, the drawer felt apart when I pulled it."
4,Its real fun the disco way!!,"Its the 80s of Bollywood , so what do ya expect? Its melodrama, dance , music , fun all the way!The hero, seems to be the Michael Jackson of India & it shows in an utterly entertaining way.Just remember to keep aside any logic whatsoever , grab yer pop corn & soda ...enjoy all the way! Its hilarious(unintentionally) , has lots of dance , music and fun. Basically a revenge story of a kid whose father is brutally murdered and he grows up to avenge ; only as a disco dancer. This is similar to movies like DISCO DANCER, DANCE DANCE etc. but probably more entertaining."
4,Naughty Christine...,"I love the naughty Christine displayed in some of these songs. The title cut is classic Lavin, irreverent, witty, and on the mark. ""Piranha Women in the Avacado Jungle of Death,"" a film I have actually seen--I'm hesitant to admit--inspired one of the best songs of the album. I also found ""The Piper"" a poignant commentary on our culture. Most of the rest I have either on other Lavin albums or they are not terribly memorable. I'm a fan, and I gave this CD four stars only because I really enjoy the few offerings I mention here."
5,EXCLUSIVE!!!,A yo this cd is official! I have so much respect for Chopper especially cuz' he proved his skillz on dis album..I see a great future for DA BAND..Dem Niccas got talent. I just wish DYLAN was acting right so we could have got more of that Dancehall vibe from him..Babs skillz is amazin..Ness was amazin..Chopper was amazin..I like Fred bcuz of his style..Sara..I really have no words bcuz she is incredible..Dylan needs to behave!!!! Diddy know what he doin wit' this group..Mad love to BAD BOY and to DA BAND!..IF U LOVE TRUE HIP-HOP GET THIS ALBUM.. Nothing LoliPop about these nig9as..Dont get it twisted!! D.A. B.A.N.D!!!!Cop dat album!!!
1,"A total Bust - ""NOT""","Six words sum up this movie... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. Because Julie K Smith was a featured starlet, I laid down my plastic for this disaster, so my review is meant to save you money. This was bad on so many levels. Usually the amply endowed Julie K Smith will brighten any movie she's in, but having her in cornrolls - come on! The rest of the girls had pimples for boobs and could not act at all. Enuf said!"
1,baberellas,"this movie was really stupid. i dont even know how i managed to get it. i misread the title and thought it was like an 80s futuristic themed movie, but its really just a poorly written and designed pg rated pornographic video. unless youre 12 and get off by stupidity, bad acting, and fake boobs I wouldnt suggest purchasing."
2,Jemaine Clement & Sam Rockwell,So we bought this movie because we really like those two actors from Flight of the Conchords and Hitchhiker's Guide. And it's the scenes with Chevalier and Bronco/Brutus that are the only good bits of the movie. The rest is completely forgettable.
1,at .99 cents this movie would to much!,My wife loves bad movies. She really wanted to see this one. It was so bad she and the family dog gave up and could not finish it. I would like to re-gift the movie but there is no one one I dislike that much.
2,Just okay,"Not nearly as funny as I was led to believe. However, I will sit through pretty much anything with Jemaine Clement."
5,Jolley's best work to date!,"David Jolley, legendary horn player in New York circles, has really topped himself with this album, catapulting himself to a level of world-class playing rarely heard from horn players. His impeccable phrasing, beautiful style, and incredible virtuosity on these works raises the standard for hornists everywhere. Such a fine ""Villanelle"" (Paul Dukas) has not been heard since Dennis Brain's legendary recording. One of the finest horn albums I've ever heard. Sam Sanders accompaniment gives life to these French masterworks. Pick it up!"
4,an underrated delight,"definite best in songwriting, this release showcases a more matured version of 'beauty and the beat.' the energy is back in a big way, not only on rock-out songs like 'im the only one' and 'turn to you,' but also on the slower cuts such as the wonderful 'capture the light' and 'beneath the blue light.'"
4,Mature Brilliance,"This isn't my favorite Go-Go's album, but I think it certainly deserves more credit than it ever gets. The centerpiece of this album remains ""Forget that Day"" that song that supposedly killed the band. Displaying a new maturity in song writing for Jane Wiedlin, Charlotte Caffey's melancholy keyboards and Kathy Valentine's background vocals(!) -- this is a grave departure from Vacation. If you don't own this you certainly should buy it right now."
5,A Bell-Like Voice,"Heidi Grant Murphy's lovely, bell-like voice make the Bach wedding cantatas on this disc a true joy. One of my all-time favorite vocal recordings."
4,Killer Bunnies Pink Booster,"An absolutely great product. The game itself is a good mix of strategy and just plain fun, ideal for 12 and up but some of my younger children learned it with ease after watching the game play for quite a while. I strongly recommend this game."
2,Not so hot,"I only read 40% of this book and couldn't take anymore. Ms. Harrington writes as much about being a proud New Yorker as she does about her dog Wallace. I realize that raising a dog in New York is probably a challenge, but I suspect not all that much different than other parts of the country that are metropolitan. I would have enjoyed this book much more without having New York thrown in the mix every other sentence."
2,need an.editor,"This book was at times a difficult read.It was very repetitive with no apparenttimeline to speak of.The editing was poor at best. Besidesspelling errors they missed the sentencesthat dearly needed improvement. I figured that herpuppy was a rescued dog from the beginning,and although the story needed to be repeated it at timesit did not needy to tell us as many times as it does(I lost count)."
4,Great Second Camera,"I was looking for a camera specifically to take fishing. I'm a fly fisherman and the camera I have been using is just too heavy, too bulky, and too expensive to carry on the river. This camera offered me a view finder, which I prefer; adequate resolution, a great lens with a very healthy optical zoom. Although somewhat dated technologically, it gives me everything I want and I'm not afraid of drowning it if I take a fall."
2,Ugh,"Wow, I was really disappointed with this album.Unfortunately, Dilla (R.I.P.) can't rap. Production, hell yeah, he can really bring the noise, but he can't rap well at all. Madlib is a decent rapper, but again, not that good. The production sounds like mainstream gangsta rap on 75% of the tracks, and that is NEVER good. Just not a good album overall, but there are a couple songs worth listening to. I would pass on this one if I were you."
5,This is a great CD!,"There aren't many debut albums that stand the test of time some 35 years after they were first released. But ""Garland Jeffreys"" is another timeless classic from the great New Yorker and singer-songwriter. ""Lon Chaney"" is a standout and was recently covered by Vetiver. Garland Jeffreys also has a YouTube video for the song.In short, buy this album - you'll love it!"
3,Garland before he found his groove,"Being a long time fan of Garland Jeffreys, I was glad to find this CD and to get it. There are 3-4 tracks that show the style he was developing but the balance are just OK songs. It is a collection of songs without any real continuity and it is clear why this never became his breakthrough album. If you are a diehard fan of GJ, you probably will find it worth buying. JB"
2,Brain Boost Beta Wave & Gamma Wave,"Pictures too small. It is very hard to see on Nintendo DS screen. Otherwise, if the image is larger, could be a good game/brain exercise."
2,Very Dated,"Although it is no fault of the author, the current version of ANSYS Workbench (version 14) has many new features and changes as compared to version 12 which this text is based on. If you are using a newer version of ANSYS, you are better off just using the ANSYS help menu and/or the on-line tutorials. I thought this might be a useful reference as I had to learn version 14 of ANSYS with no prior experience, but it has not been very helpful and certainly not worth what the book costs. If for some reason you are going to be using version 12, this may potentially be a helpful reference."
2,AGAIN?,"This show has been shown on playhouse disney severaltimes. I have learned to hate these episodes, even though Ilove Madeline."
2,Poor video quality,"I also bought a Sanyo Xacti C40 at a local RadioShack for $199 and compare the two side by side. Samsung has a terrible video quality, even though it has 512MB internal storage and 10X optical zoom. Other than that, Xacti is better in every other aspect, including a much larger lens, better ergonomics, and much better video quality."
2,Not exactly what I thought it was.,"I thought that this would describe various destinations in detail. Instead, it simply lists attractions, restaurants, hotels, etc. and rates them. The descriptions are quotes from people who have visited. I didn't think it was helpful."
2,"Pretty, but soft wood.","This bed is nice looking and works ok (I've had to retighten all the screws after some use), but the wood is so soft that ANY banging on it leaves a mark. You have to be very careful during assembly not to scratch and dent it. And, my toddler (who isn't too wild) has left lots of marks all over it.It is not worth paying a premium for the fact that it is convertible to a full sized bed since it will be pretty beat up by the time it gets to that point. I wish we had spent half as much on a toddler bed and then just gotten a bigger bed when we needed it."
3,good size,nice color and size. construction quality seems okay but wood is very soft. be careful when moving this furniture and it chips very easily. good for the price
3,Wheres armada and G1?,this Prime is is a little lame. I mean stand this up with energon megatron hes like a midget! In vehicle mode hes really stpid looking and in robot mode hes a little bit better. the only thing good about this trans formers is super mode. the op number 3 is pretty sweet for an arm but he still is lame. the armada transformer Prime is sooooooooo much better.
1,"this isnt opimus, its a waste of cash","first off i wana make my idea of what a good trans former line is-G1- BEST TOYS EVAR!!!!!!!!G2- still coolBW- what robots into animals not even robot animals just animals??!!!! STUPID!transmetals- yay they made BW even worse...Beast machines- WORST TRANSFORMER LINE EVER!RID- Holy crap G1 is back!!!Armada- how is this possible a line as good as G1 without copying G1!Energon- im reconisedering BM as the 2nd worst now...THIS IS HORRIBLE! its like the power rangers jumed on opitmus for a pony ride after he became morrbily obese! ive heard that the posiblity on this toy is great but i dont think so. what really gets me mad is when people compare the armada line's prime to this...this...worthless voltron rip off. gez, its mouth was molded wrong in the first run!!!! THIS IS A DISGRACE!!! 20th aniversery prime will be out soon, save up for it insead, if you cant do that then get yourseve a prime from a good line."
1,Not recomended unless you like the Power Rangers.,"Wow, what a total dissapointment. If this were a Power Rangers Megazord I would have to give him 5 stars. But as a Transformer, he isn't. Yes, he's got good articulation, but thats it. His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out. Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a ""transformer"" and only gets 1 star...yuck."
1,wish i could give 0 stars,"This company accepted my order, took my money and then refused to return my funds when the item wasn't available. It doesn't matter how good this product is, HomeandWine is not a business to deal with."
3,great item - but,"a nice item for opening standard 750ML wine bottles, but, opener cannotbe used to open the larger 1.5L bottles according to instructions included - this is information that should be pointed in product description"
1,It's journalism,This magazine is written by snobbish journalists who don't have a clue what the masses prefer. It is very opinionated and does assumes that everyone wants a race car. Don't waste your money
2,kind of a disapointment,"Rodney Carrington is awesome,but on Nut Sack he goes for songs. Only the first 5 tracks are stand up comedy.The rest of the CD is songs.So if you are after stand up comedy I would recommend one Rodney's previous albums like Morning Wood,which is great."
3,It is very refreshing to think that your chilren might save you and your future.,"The movie is very well done also. The contemporary David Coradine could lear some from his past movies, could he not?"
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent survey of the history and design of safety cards. I thought that the cards selected were an excellent choice and it would have been impossible for it to be comprehensive. Overall, an excellent book."
4,"GREAT BAND, Good album","1st let me say I adore SGM. I think they are one of the most creative bands in rock today. Having said that, I would recommend any other album to a first time listener. This album is one for the fans. The sound quality isn't the best and there is a lot of banter. The band is amazing live, but I don't think this album captures that as well as it could. If you are a fan, BUY this now. If you are buying your first album, get one of the others (My favorite is ""Inglorious times"")"
5,Great,"The item I oredered came quickly, packaged really nicely. Would definitly recommend purchasing from them."
4,computer lover's toy,"My nephew reports great enjoyment of the Webkinz cow. He especially loves the games the accompanying computer code unlocks. I am not sure how interested he is in the actual stuffed animal, it is the computer part he is crazy about!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"These are by far the WORST pellets. I was running low on my Crosman Copperhead .177 Pointed Pellets (7.9gr), and figured I'd try these cheap Daisy pellets. Shot a Crosman...hit... shot the Daisy...hit, but the impact was way off (high). I rotated the brands about 6X, and had only one hit (after the 1st way off hit) w/ the Daisy pellets. I shot about 8 Daisy pellets in a row, and got 2 hits. The others missed the target (rice box) completely. Shots were taken at about 23 yards using a sighted scope. I'll stick w/ Crosman pellets..."
5,Daisy Max Precision Pellets,Decent amount for the price. Quality bonding time in a can. The boys will be stoked! Can't wait to shoot!
4,IT'S A GOOD REVIEW,"If you're looking for a little review before the test, this book will help. It is very general and does oversimply things, but it helps. The tests in it are accurate, exept for the third one which is exeptinally hard."
1,High Roller,"This was suppose to be the Stu Ungar story, but they got EVERYTHING wrong. The only relation to Stu's real life and the movie is the name of the character. They got all the supporting characters wrong. They got events wrong. They left out tons of important details. This movie is a waste of money."
5,DON'T PASS THIS ONE OVER,"gambling superstar stu ungar continually beat the odds of the game, but his legendary skill could not help him overcome the risks of addiction and excess.DVD includes commentary by michael imperioli, director a.w. vidmer, and poker expert vince van patten.sopranos and casino fans will love all of the camios made by the stars of these movies and imperioli turns in a great performance in this very watchable and very likeable gambling drama."
4,Domesic Violence hurts both body and soul,"Sweet Tomorrows gives the reader a look at how deeply physical and emotional abuse can affect one's ability to love again. It is difficult for Talya to give all of herself to a ""loving"" man, because her abuser still has control. But, Meridian, with his syrupy voice, giving nature and passion, gradually breaks through so that Talya is free to forgive herself and love again."
2,disappointing...,"I am not a huge fan of Red Skelton's but this set sounded interesting and the price was low.Unfortunately,from what I have watched, it is no surprize this early 70s show at the nadir of Red's career was short lived.The opening monologues are dated and listless, the comedy sketches seem trite , forced and lame - Skelton often tries to break up his guests and this makes much of it seem amateurish. This is unlike the breakups on CAROL BURNETT where the the professionals try to keep in character.And even with these being variety shows , the musical guest like Cass Elliott et al are not allowed to sing..Unless you are a diehard fan , avoid this set"
3,"Not bad, but there's better","The book was a tough read, that you couldn't speed through to totally comprehend. I did like the detail of the book, but there seemed to be alot that could have been cut out due to irrelevance.Overall though, I would recommend reading the book if you want to get a grasp on the history behind the terrible Rwandan genocide."
4,Good Film Music,I bought this Cd mainly because I like the Sheena Easton opening and closing title track. The surround sound effect on the Film Soundtrack version is the best I have heard of the song and as a Sheena Easton fan a must have for me.The rest of the tracks remind you of the film and always makes me want to watch it again.A must have in my music collection.
4,Surprised--it was good.,"To be honest, I rented this movie just to see Michael Dorn without his makeup (WOW, by the way). I planned to fast-forward thru most of the movie, but ended up watching the whole movie (twice). It was pretty good. Worth a viewing to any Dorn or Eggert fan."
4,Nice spray paint.,"One of the things I look for in spray paint is an easy to operate nozzle that sprays easily and without dripping. So far, I like this product. It sprays nice and evenly and I trust the Rustoleum name."
5,Rye Triscuit Locator,"Dudes/ettes,They are savory. Don't do without!Found them at Randall's stores in my 'hood.Just go to the Kraft foods website and they have a product locator that is very specific and accurate. You WILL find your beloved Rye Triscuit."
5,Enjoyed by all our kids,"We picked this up as a used book 12 years ago, and all of our children have loved this. Its symbols (magic blanket, ark, rainbow) and story convey a sense of magic and such a loving home with Snuggle Piggy's Aunt Daisy. This is a wonderful bedtime book with how charming and calming it is."
2,I think this is the worst of John Barry's 007 scores...,"I never really enjoyed the music during the film (nor, for that matter, did I enjoy the film!). Very tacky, dated, too much American flavour to the whole thing. Sadly, listening to the extended soundtrack has reminded me only of why I never liked this film!Particularly dislikable tracks included : slumber Inc, The Whyte House, Circus Circus.That whole excessive use of 'vibrato' (?) and other musical techniques sound so dated...I am a huge, huge fan of Barry's other Bond scores, esp You Only Live Twice, and OHMSS, Moonraker and others. I think OHMSS is the best. So wonderful, lyrical, exciting yet wonderfully romantic at times.Sadly, these Diamonds just don't cut it for me..."
4,BUY IT AT TUESDAY MORNING,"This toy is pretty awesome for $14.99, which is just what I purchased it for at Tuesday Morning a few days ago. It is well worth that price. Go find it."
4,Lexmark Z11,"I really like my printer, there is only one problem I have with it. I can not seem to find the ink replacement for it!! But as far as the printer itself goes it does everything I need it to!!"
3,LB can do better,"This album disappoints for those with high hopes for LB. As a huge Latyrx/Quannum fan, the LB album was highly anticipated. Reviews made it sound like there was even more cause for hope. Sadly, it disappoints these expectations.A good album with flashes of brilliance. Skits are distacting/useless. When LB stops the theatrics and gets down to his signature style, the album is at its best.It is listenable, but LB is capable of putting together a classic album and it is not Later That Day."
4,Regency romp--with vampires,"This was the first Teresa Madeiros book I've read, and her skillful plotting, dry humor and appealing characters make a satisfying package.Ms. Madeiros takes the standard romance trope of impoverished heroine, handsome hero hiding a Dark Secret thrown together in a mysterious castle and makes it new. The spirited repartee between the main characters, some nicely handled misunderstandings and a shadowy Really Bad Guy it will take everyone's united forces to defeat make for a highly entertaining read.The strength of this book is in its economy. There is nothing extraneous and nothing that does not further the plot. There are some liberties taken with 19th century mores and class distinctions, but they're all in aid of the delightful story."
4,Great Historical Vampire Story,"I love this time period very much. The Vampire and historicaltime period worked great together. My only complaint is waitingfor Portia and Julian's story until Summer 2006 is a long waitfor a second book. I don't re-read books, too many book, tolittle time as it is. Hope I remember this story.ThanksCT"
2,Fire Hose Not Durable Enough,"I was disappointed with the Kyjen Fire Hose. The first day we had it, my dog (a labrador retriever) played fetch with it, carried it around, and although he is not a ""destructive dog"", I noticed the fabric was already beginning to shred. We only get it out for supervised playing fetch, but it already looks like it'll be falling apart very soon. I had purchased a fire hose toy at a local pet store a couple of years ago, and that product lasted extremely well - the fabric was much more durable than the current toy. I would not recommend this toy."
2,"Not tough, but the best toy I have for the beach.","I have been having a real hard time finding a 'tough' toy to take to the beach. My 65lbs pit mix is and extreme chewer. I love how this toy floats and is easily seen in the surf, and he loves walking up and down the beach carrying it in his mouth like the goof that he is, but within 5 minutes of sitting down to relax he had the corner chewed off."
4,pretty good toy,My golden/poodle mix has had this toy for years. She is an average chewer and really enjoys this toy. I did have a friend with a lab mix who was a strong chewer and this toy lasted a few months.
2,Disappointing,This did not live up to expectations. The squeaker was lame to say the least. The toy began to fray almost immediately and lasted about a day. I have had much more success with the Tuffy's toys.
