3,Some interesting stuff to be found here...,"The sections featuring Omar Shariff do tend to dumb down the subject area and attempt to create mysteries when solutions are readily available - at least these days - so on this basis you might think this tape is a waste of time. You would be wrong because it includes sections that follow egyptologist Mark Lehner into areas rarely seen in such detail, for example the relieving chambers above the King's Chamber, the passages inside the Sphinx and several underground locations around the Giza plateau. For this reason alone, the tape is worth the price of admission."
5,Don't buy it from antonline,I bought this phone which works great now that I have a working battery for it. It was shipped to me from Antonline with a battery that didn't work. When I tried to exchange it for a new one they were extremely uncooperative and said that I would have to return the item (possibly be subjected to a restocking fee) and place the order again. Instead I found a replacement battery and bought that-phone works great now!
2,Not very reliable after first year,"I bought this because it had multiple handsets and seemed like a good buy. After the first year we started having troubles, and now into the 3rd year only the main base and one handset work. It's not as simple as just replacing the rechargeable battery either, unfortunately. If you want cheap, with multiple handsets, and can afford to replace every few years, this was okay. Otherwise, spend the money and look elsewhere for more reliable equipment."
4,Best Deal Going,"This guy is full of features on the base and the handset. Completely met my needs. The speakerphone on handset has turned out to be a great feature. Long speakerphone conversations should be done on base, since the handset is powered by battery only, and the speakerphone realy pulls it down. however, for the unexpected need for a short handsfree conversation, it is super handy.Incredible pricing."
5,Good Product!,I have two of these and I LOVE it! I do not use the entire 16 feet so I roll up the cord and use what I need. It is not a problem!
2,Not a BELKIN!!!!,"I rated it with two stars for the simple fact that the cable I received is not BELKIN. It doesn't even look like the one on the pic, and is not 16 ft is 15ft. I know is only a foot, but I wish I had it to give my printer some extra wire. The cable I received works fine; its just the false advertising what bother me."
5,Excellent Packaging. Even Better Quality!,"It's important to me that any of my purchased items are well protected in good packaging. This seller did just that. The quality of the product is phenomenal and I was very satisfied with the speed of the delivery! Thanks, will buy again -"
5,Works Perfect,"What more can you ask for? It's cheap, it's long, and it works. Never had any problem with it."
3,usb cable,Okay for some devices but I can not get it to work for some of the hookups that I have tried because it is just too long.It seems to be made well though and provides a snug fit as expected.
1,Dead On Arrival,"It has been some time since we ordered it, but just got around to hooking up the printer to use it for scanning and the cable is defective. Of course we only paid $5.89 for it, so it ain't worth packaging up and sending back for a partial refund. No big deal, but thought I would at least state this in the review. Granted, we should have tested it when we first got it, but we did not and it is what it is. We simply ordered another brand. Btw... it seems strange that nowhere on the cable is it labeled Belkin... may be a fake."
5,usb,"the product is fine. Works perfect, no issues what so ever.Would reccomend product to other buyers. The price was also very good."
5,Excellent cable for long USB runs,"Another great product from Belkin. Don't waste your time and money buying the cheaper cables. At $7.98 you cannot go wrong with this brand name cable. I bought this to connect my CCTV DVR (locked in a closet) to a monitor that supports USB inputs so I could use a wireless mouse to control the DVR. With the transmitter directly in the DVR, it was to far and enclosed to communicate to the mouse. With this cable connected to my monitor, I put the transmitter into the monitor and now my mouse works flawlessly. Using a separate monitor dedicated to CCTV allows me to not have to keep switching windows on my computer monitor to view my cameras. Very happy with this purchase."
1,Does not work with either of the peripherals I've used it with,"This was part of a recommended bundle for a Fujitsu scanner. Quick summary: it didn't work. Windows gave me a warning that the USB device wasn't recognized after I hooked it up.Swapping it with a 15' USB cable I've been using to drive a printer for over a year worked great, but I ran into the same problem when I tried to run my existing printer using the new cable.Disappointing. Now I'm searching for another 15' USB cable, and I was shocked to discover this was among the top recommended items."
3,"A few gems of wisdom, but you'll have to dig for them","There are some real gems of wisdom in Bird by Bird, but you have to do a lot of digging to get to them. Lamott's meandering style provides a lot of insight into how she, personally, lives the life of a writer--and it's usually a good thing when writers commiserate together--but I would have preferred a bit more practicality and straightforwardness to her advice. This is another of those writing books that blends memoir with craft. The problem is, though, that the memoir part is a rambling morass of experience and observation, a thick stratum of stream-of-consciousness muck in which the tiny, sentence-long bits of craft are embedded."
1,Good advice on writing -- bad advice on life,"I am at a loss to explain the glowing reviews of this book. Although Bird by Bird contains good advice on writing, I found the author extremely unlikable. Self-absorbed, egotistical, neurotic -- I guess if you take her as an example of how not to live your life, the idea works. I personally don't see how anyone could view her as a role model (cocaine and God? well, that's Northern California for you...).A more helpful book would have at least included some advice for us poor souls who are otherwise employable (and have jobs) but still want to write. She seems to assume that everyone reading her book has the entire day free to write (or whine, or do ""retail therapy"").Finally, as a personal note to the author -- Ms. Lamott, it's called ""shopping"", not retail therapy. Get over yourself. And for your son's sake, stop doing drugs."
5,Highly Recommended,"I own scores of books on writing, and this is in the top tier. The advice is both practical and clear, and Lammot's style is a delight to read. Her best tips are allowing your work to be bad at first, and to tackle small projects initially. There's more, and at the end you'll wish you could meet her and dine with her. I just heard she has a new book out, and I'm eager to see it."
5,Excellent read,what a wonderfully touching book with a great deal of character! Lammott is so very humorous and very relatable. I read it again and again!
1,Did she have to tell the writer to act like a 'big autistic child'?,"Really? It happens in the first thirty seconds and totally put me off the rest of the book, I returned it to audible and told them why. In this day and age, an editor didn't tell this woman that would be offensive to all us parents of 'big autistic children'? Is there not another way to say a writer must become single-minded in their pursuit? I really wanted to like this book, instead it put me in a crappy mood and I cried. What a waste, and shame on you, you're an adult, you should know better. Now go act like a big developmentally disabled child yourself, and see where it gets you."
4,"Beyond the book - ""Real"" Life Tips","Yes, this is a book on instructions for writing, but of greater value are Anne Lamott's ""real"" life tips. These are ""real"" because they are very straight-forward, honest and humorous. Can you imagine saying to your friend, ""I hate you""? You know you may have thought this at one time or another but Lamott says it. The question is whether she was serious or just allowing her inner voice to get some ink in ""Bird by Bird"".From the perspecctive of advice on writing this book does contain worthy advice for all levels of writers. Her examples will tickle alive your thoughts and creativity. You will finish reading several pages or chapters and think, ""I got it, I know what I can do"". She helps you to let go.Today's world is moving fast, very fast and most of us (not me) are frantically trying to keep up with every little detail. Stop! Pick up your copy of ""Bird by Bird"" and let your heart, mind and soul feel good."
2,Not that impressive,This wasn't what I was hoping for. It left me with a who cares and where are we going next response.
5,Get your head out of the clouds & start writing today!,"Anne Lamott's book, ""Bird by Bird,"" is a delightful, down-to-earth look at the frustrations and small joys of becoming a writer. From the first page on, Ms. Lamott encourages her readers to to think realistically about their dreams of authorship. With a keen wit and an 'I've been there myself' undertone, Ms. Lamott takes her reader through the steps of beginning and completing a writing project, never losing sight of the fact that becoming an accomplished and published writer is a difficult task at best and even the best efforts can net zero profits. But, Bird by Bird also delves into the depths of the pleasures of writing, be it a short essay of a personal nature, kept for oneself, or complete manuscript accepted for publication. In either case, Ms. Lamott's respect for the writer within is evident. To all letter-writers, diarists, journalists, fiction-writers - enjoy and write, write, write!"
5,Truly Inspirational,"This book is was so fun to read. It inspired me to start writing immediately. Lamott writes honestly and humorously about the meaningfulness of writing. She offers tips on how to have the right attitude for writing; for example, expecting bad first drafts. It was such a relief to find this book. Made me feel like I'm on the right track and encouraged me never to give up on writing."
5,I loved this book.,"A fantastic book that, unlike other writing books, doesn't read as condescending advice, more like wisdom handed down from an entertaining, self-depricating friend. Amusing, entertaining and inspiring ... what more could you ask for in a book?"
4,not what you think...,"This book is not what you think it's going to be...in some ways it's slightly disappointing, in others it's a goldmine!By giving us the reasons to pursue good story and character development along with little stories of her own along the way Lamott has created a fun, easy to read, quick quide to life and writing that makes it a no brainer what to do next. As a 'young' writer trying to fit all the pieces together I had hoped this book was something else, but am pleasantly stunned to find out that it is something better than I knew I was looking for. Everything from story and character to creating time to write as well as how to get back on track. Even permission to do less than your stellar best makes this a must read for anyone who has taken a moment to question, ""Now what?"""
5,Every Meet Someone As Crazy As Yourself?,"Reading Anne Lamott is like sitting down with a close friend whoshares all of your idiosyncracies and insanities, as well as yourwarped sense of humor. Bird by Bird gives Lamott's view of thewriting life and confronts all of the little details and major crisesfaced by anyone who's ever wanted to write. Filled with warm andwitty anecdotes from her own writing career and from the classesshe teaches, Lamott takes you gently by the hand and thenproceeds to push, pull, or drag you to the pencil or the keyboardbecause you suddenly feel that you have to write something, rightnow! This is a book to keep next to the bed or the computer, orwherever else you're likely to be when you need a nudge to keepgoing and a major dose of inspiration. Read this book with ahighlighter grasped tightly in your sweaty palm, because you're goingto want to come back to certain lines over and over again. Highlyrecommended."
1,Worst Mop Ever,In sum the product is not good at all. I feel like you really have to scrub twice as much as you do with a regular mop. I clean my floors everyday so it is not like my floors are super filthy. And the streaks that it leaves make it even worse. I am not impressed and I am actually adding it to my yard sale this weekend.
3,not up to the usual D-K standard,"This guide is not up to the usual D-K standard. I like to take pictures for photo.net when I travel and it is very helpful to have the little sample photos of destinations so that one can decide whether or not to invest the time.But D-K Barcelona is very skimpy on details and also on tourist attractions and facilities as soon as you venture out of the Old City.For authoritative restaurant and hotel recommendations, go with Michelin Red. For architecture and art history, get the Blue Guide. For nightlife, try the TimeOut guide. Overall, people say that the Rough Guide is very good.Whatever guidebook you choose, watch your belongings in Barcelona. Pickpocketing is an industry there, esp. in the Old City and on La Rambla. Women should not carry purses. Men should keep money in a money belt or zippered inner jacket pocket. Limit yourself to one camera that you can keep in your hands at all times."
4,wonderfully written,"A wonderfully written story of reconciling and coming to terms with love, hope, faith and fate as seen through the eyes of two cultures."
5,A must for any pop culture fan!,"I highly recommend this book to all those interested in tikis (of course), art (especially those who enjoy Juxtapoz art magazine), or popular culture in general. I loved both the art (paintings, photos, carvings and more), and the essays by Sven Kirsten and Boyd Rice. The book is full of great art in vibrant color."
1,The battery die after 2 month,I bought two extended battery in different time frame. Both battery die after two month. There is no warrenty on the battery. I will not suggest you buy this product.
4,"Requires few ""accessories"" - good to keep on hand","This book mainly contains activities and games that don't require a lot of props. Or if a game requires a prop, the materials are usually already in the house. We loved the balance beam game and made our own out of a 2x4 laid across two books. Our toddler learned balance and increased her confidence.I like the book categories - can easily find a ""type"" of game. I also like that the book is additionally sorted by age.This definitely is not an arts and crafts book; if you're looking for a variety of artsy things to do with your child, this is not the book to buy.But, I have plenty of those books and was happy to find a book that my husband could thumb through and pick an activity without having to make a shopping trip.Also nice to leave out for babysitters or visiting relatives, to help them interact with the baby - and to help the baby get used to them."
2,Not impressive,"This book is full of not much. There are a handful of interesting, thoughtful games, but mostly it is totally ridiculous, like - go outside and feel the wind in your hair and hold a worm in your hand, or build a tent indoors with a sheet draped over a couple of chairs. Maybe useful to someone who has never played before, but there is almost nothing in this book that is new or interesting for any parent who was once a child or has spent even a minimal amount of time around children. Not worth the money."
5,Touching the Game touches all the bases,"I grew up summers on the Cape and remember seeing guys like Will Clark and Jeff Reardon playing down there. The Cape League was pretty big back then, but has climbed to new levels today, and Touching The Game gets it right. I loved the human interest stories from the summer of 2003, and look forward to seeing if any of these players make it to the Major Leagues. And the stories from such baseball luminaries as Nomar Garciaparra, Todd Helton, Frank Thomas, Buck Showalter and Jeff Bagwell are classic! But the film is more than just baseball, it accurately portrays what summer is like on Cape Cod, especially for the kids. If you are familiar with the Cape Cod Baseball League this film will be a terrific depiction of what you remember. If you just love baseball, and want to learn more about this great league, Touching The Game covers all the bases."
1,too small to serve noodle soup!,"I did not read the description carefully. It is advertised as BIG BOWL, yet it is too small to serve oriental noodle soup. Look for other bigger bowls if you plan to use it for noodle soup."
5,great toy!,This was a fun toy! I used it as a little set up to hint to my boyfriend I made us reservation to go snowboarding and he played with it more than I thought he would! The whole family got a kick out of it.
2,Not hearing the music,"Bought this toy for my daughter when she was 15 months old. Never even looked at it! My son is not interested either. I have babysat for a little boy, too, from 8 months to now 14 months and he has yet to even pick it up! We have not heard the music yet - even with some encouragement."
5,My first guitar!,"I bought this guitar for my nephew who was 6 months old at the time. He loved the music and the animals. I ask my sister in law if I could have it back because she was giving away toys that he did not play with anymore. To my surprise he still loves his little guitar and he is 2 1/2 now. It is one of his favorite toys. So for Christmas ""10, I bought it for my other nephew who is 9 months old. I hope that he gets the same use out of it. I would buy this guitar again. Great gift to get them into playing musical instruments."
2,It's a ehh toy,"I got htis for my son when he was 6month he is now 18 months. He will give it a look like ehh do i want to play with it or not. This toy looks like it has alot to do on it, but it dont. It plays some music with lyrics that are not completely understandable."
4,Great educational music toy,"My 13 month old loves the songs on this guitar. It is really educational, and you can choose between counting, alphabet, and animal sounds. You can also choose English or Spanish. He loves animal sounds right now so that captivates him. My only issue is that the girl's voice can be a bit annoying, but I think that is probably a personal issue. You can choose two volume settings, which is nice. There is also an off switch, a must for any musical toy!"
3,Good Toy,It is a good toy for a two year old. The toy does not offer much in the quantity songs and numbers offered. Not happy with the shipping. My order added up the $100.00 and no free shipping to Puerto Rico. Now my question is why Alaska and Hawaii get the free shipping?
1,Ripoff,"I dislike being ripped off. The cover is a plastic licence plate cover used for car shows which you can find for $5.99 on this web site. Search for ""Cruiser Shield 74100""."
1,SAM,it does not work anymore. since there is always more than one camera. Also cop will put u over when they see the plate.
3,You get what you pay for,"When I first got this knife it was extreamly sharp. But after using it 3 times to cut plastic off of pallets for my job the knife became very dull. Also the knife became very loose when opened. I'm sure I can get it sharp again at a local knife shop and tighter as well, but I feel like the durability should of been a little better"
2,Not as great as I remembered it.,"First off, for the $11.21, I certainly admit this to be a good buy. However I bought this because I had lost it years ago, and was hoping to rekindle some lost flame.I bought it at Gander Mtn. in Arizona. It was much more expensive. And it operated smooth as butter.After opening my new one from Amazon... I am frustrated as to how difficult it is to get the knife ""opening"" initially with the thumb stud! I have to push up almost to the point of miscomfort.Once open, the blade does lock quite nicely. Overall the shape, and style just don't impress me as much I guess. I would check out the SWMP1B/2B knives instead.Now on what J. Sweaney (Kerrville Tx) said: I do not believe this is counterfeit. ([...]) They have the same knife on their website, just another color."
3,"Nothing remarkable, certainly not for Extreme Ops","I purchased several of these to give as casual gifts for co-workers. I find a knife a very useful tool. There's nothint special about these S&W knives. In fact I find them somewhat below S&W standard having owned a fantastic one. There's nothing inherently wrong, the steel is adequate and comes utility sharp. I haven't and won't bother to put a keener edge on any. Relatively inexpensive, if it breaks you won't care very much, but expensive enough you should expect it to not fall apart on you. I'm wouldn't want to rely on it in a pinch, but it's adequate for day to day or light industrial use. Stamped patterned metal grips not effective in extreme cold or when wet."
4,Kyoto at its best,"Personally, the Kyoto storyline has always been my favorite out of all associated with Rurouni Kenshin, and these episodes are one of those periods where you just have to sit back and enjoy what's before you, rather than over-analyze what it may have or lack. One of my younger sisters in particular loves the episode concerning Yahiko and the disappearence of the reverse-blade sword. A good DVD to have if you're in the mood for a less intense, but still enjoyable Kenshin experience."
5,The Borowsky Family's Musical Favorites of All Times,"Musical Favorites of All Times, the Borowsky family's genre spanning arrangement of classical music, is a collection of long cherished and well-known pieces, all played with a clarity and skillful sound unique to the Borowsky family of musicians. This collection has clearly been put together with hard work, and dedication, not to mention skill, as the pieces within represent some of the most accurate, soulful, and standard breaking playing of our time.As best exemplified by the performance of David Popper's Gavotte, and Ernest Bloch's Nigun, the Borowsky family plays with authority, commanding the ear, leading the listener into the swirling emotion of the piece being played.Five stars out of five for an impressive collection and a wonderful listening experience that defines the epitome of what the classical musician should be."
3,Interesting but violent!,"The concept of this story is very interesting and keeps you reading to find out what will happen. Unfortunately the story is also filled with an overkill of violence. A good portion of this book is dedicated to introducing characters just so the author can viciously kill them off latter in the book to show how evil the evil characters are.Overall I found the premises behind the story (a dragon changeling) very interesting but, after such a build up, the ending came as a let down."
3,Nice bag,"1) The main compartment is well designed and easily holds enough clothes for a week (including gym/beach clothes and shoes).2) The zippers are durable and don't snag3) The design is simple and attractive4) The wheels were great for the first 2 weeks but were damaged twice while traveling. They do not appear to be easily replaced so now I'm dealing with a ""lumpy"" ride. I wish they would have made these critical parts easily replaceable."
3,Conway is always a riot.,"Works with several funny moments, but does not compare to his bit ""Dorf on Golf."" Conway is special to be sure."
5,CLEP Freshman College Composition,This book has everything I need to study for the CLEP exam. The CD for my computer also has more practice test just like the exam will have. The only thing it does not have is an essay part.
4,CLEP missed a step,"CLEP Freshman College Comp is a quick, easy-to-read study guide, with practice tests that are, technically, almost exactly like the actual CLEP exam. In fact I already took and passed the test, and this book really did help quite a bit. My disappointment lies in the fact that much of the text information is not on the quizes or tests themselves. (ex: nothing about fiction and drama were in the practice or the real exam re: plot, characterization, style), so I felt that it was a waste of my time, as I could have concentrated more on MLA information, which is minimal in the text, but present in all tests. The other thing that was disappointing was the Software disc. It is compatible solely with Windows, information not found on Amazon, but in fine print.Anyway, it is what it is, but you asked and I figured this info could be helpful."
5,I beg to differ!,"Great improvisational jazz! While this doesn't have the commercial feel of a bunch of Brazilian samba's, it is excellent improvisational jazz. To some this may sound like pointless wandering, but other ears will find it interesting and challenging. This is a live recording, not a studio recording, but the sound quality is fine for what it is. I would rate this 4 stars."
3,Tango,"""The Tao of Tango poses some fascinating theories about masculine/feminine [energies] and the powers each possess. Johanna understands the power of the dance, [and] what it brings to our lives. """
2,Tao Means Natural Flow,"I've been dancing Argentine tango (as well as teaching it)for 15 years. I haven't met a woman who wants to devote the time and energy to learn this properly. Most women go to groups (or take a few private lessons) and learn a few steps, but cannot execute moves and adornments that make tango fun. Just walking through tango steps is NOT dancing the tango. Obviously a man needs a good partner, someone who can improvise and supplement his moves (energy), but in my experience I've found it frustrating. The Tao is all about letting go, and being one with creation, but struggling with a woman who can't move is NOT how to do it.In Argentina, children learn to dance the tango early in school. There is no fairy godmother who'll tap you with her magic wand. If you think you can dance the tango after reading a book, supplement this book with a private coach."
4,Good story but...,"While I like the story, I have to admit that I've read free fan fiction that had a better handle on the characters. The bickering was out of character as was Teal'c ""telling on"" the other members of SG1. I have yet to read part 2 so I'm hoping it gets better because I feel like I'm reading about someone else, not SG1."
4,Pretty good stuff,"It's great that a world still exists for more SG1 adventures post SERIES.I found the book enjoyable, and I could hear the characters for the most part speaking the lines.If you've got a craving, and a ""need for read"" you should consider picking this up."
5,Find the...Mania!!!,"We purchased Find the Duck 3 months ago for my daughters first birthday and like the other reviewer said, it instantly became one of her favorites and she too gets much excitement and pride out of finding each hiding duck! The illustrations are bright and cheery and while some ducks are completely obvious, others are a challenge for a little one. The rhyming is simple and fun too, ""there is duck on the floor....now he's going out the door"". We love this book so much that we have ordered all 5 of the other ""find the"" books for Christmas! We can't wait to find the puppy, teddy, bird, kitten & piglet. Great fun for the littlest readers!"
5,Works well!,I bought this 25 ft white belkin ethernet cable about a month ago for my imac. Speed is very good and the color blends well with my carpet and baseboard. I'm buying another for my printer.
4,Concise review of Biology and Verbal portions of the MCAT,"This book covers all the basics of biology. For someone like me, who had a lacking undergrad bio course, this book helps. The diagrams throughout the book are very helpful because they give you another way of remembering the concepts. This book is limited with testing questions, and is better used as a study aid. All in all, this is great for reviewing bio, but it should not be your only source of studying for the MCAT bio section. I have not yet looked at the verbal section, but it looks promising."
4,"The sound is muddy, but the songs are great","I'm a bit reluctant to give this album all of four stars, beacuse it's really not a very good live album, but I'm going to do it anyway because of the strenght of the material recorded here. ""CCR Live in Europe"" contains live renditions of 12 great Fogerty compositions such as ""Proud Mary"", ""Lodi"", ""Travelin' Band"" and ""Up Around The Bend"", but the sound is pretty bad, and the departure of rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty dosn't make things any better. Unless you're a true CCR afficionado (in which case this album is quite interesting), you'll be better of with the other CCR live album, ""The Concert"", which has a much better sound. Or you could get both of them!"
4,"Yeah, it's not their best, but...","this is a great testament of the energy that CCR had on stage until the very end. Unfortunately, the concert starts out with a rather routine performance of Born on the Bayou, which may dampen listener enthusiasm initially. After that the band starts to really roll, starting with Green River/Suzie Q, peaking with Traveling Band and Fortunate Son, and very enjoyable versions of Lodi, Bad Moon Rising and Proud Mary. I really appreciate that the three players seem to be enjoying the performance. The sound is slightly muddled, which gives the disk a ""garage-band sound""...it sounds a little bit like you are listening from just off-stage at the show.Others have commented that this may include crowd sounds edited in. I don't know about that, but the crowd certaining seems realistic and the performance is no doubt from the tour.Definately worth 5-10 bucks for the great songs and energetic showmanship."
3,"CLOROX SHOWER WAND REPLACEMENT PADS OBSOLETE, DON'T BOTHER BUYING","DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO ATTACH SOMETHING ELSE TO IT. THEY DON'T MAKE THE REPLACEMENT WANDS ANYMORE, HAVEN'T FOR YEARS. THE LEAST THESE PEOPLE CAN DO IS REDUCE THE PRICE, RATHER THAN CONTINUE TO DUPE INNOCENT PEOPLE. IT WAS GREAT TO USE FOR DAD'S SHOWER. NOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE RUBBER BAND AND TIE AROUND CLOTH OR SOME MAKE SHIFT THING. USELESS. 3 STARS BECAUSE YOU CAN' USE IT ANYMORE. THE PRODUCT WAS, PAST TENSE, GOOD."
5,Back-saver,"This product is wonderful! I injured my back years ago and have had to find cleaning products to get the work done quickly and with as little back strain as possible. This does the trick-and I love a clean bathroom. I'm thinking of getting one for an elderly person who can still do housework, but could use a little help."
1,Absolutely the Worst,"I bought three boxes of the Clorox Bath Wand refills from Polsteins Home & Beyond. The pads are held to the wand by a semi-Velcro type arrangement. There are hooks on the wand, spun fiber on the pad. After less than a minutes use (one or two scrubbing motions) the spun fiber detaches from the pad and becomes utterly useless. Will I buy anything else from this place? Definitely Not! Would I recommend buying anything from Polsteins Home & Beyond? Only to someone I didn't like."
4,"Basic Wire, Works Well","This wire is on a nice sturdy spool, apparently quality insulation and core.Red color is bright and consistent throughout the spool. Basic and functional."
3,Bought to string LED lights together,The casing around the wire is pretty cheap and flimsy - If I had known I would have bought more expensive cable. Does the job though.
3,Should Not Have Been Published This Way,"""The Lake"" starts out impressively, pulling you in. I loved the story of the totally insane Candyman.Towards the end, the book is in bits and pieces, and it was obvious that Mr. Laymon was, sadly, not around to finish it. It saddens me to know that such a great writer is no longer with us.The author aside, the story was a good one, even though the end really needs a major cleaning-up. I would really look forward to a re-write from a ghostwriter or even a movie."
2,One of the worst books,"I know how misleading books can be with the title and cover art but this story caught me totally off guard. Judging by the cover I was expecting a family moving into an old house by the lake with spooky goings on, but this really had nothing to do with a lake at all. There's a good flashback about one of the characters summers spent at a lake, it was well written and hard to put down for the first few days, then after that it all got a bit confusing. Nothing is really well explained, there seems to be about five stories in one, you wonder whether Laymon was thinking about keeping it in just to prove he had a lot of ideas, at one point during the book where Diana goes into the house full of old hags, I felt like putting the book down it was so far-fetched. I love Richard Laymon but this was the worst book I have read by him..."
4,DVD recorder,"Great unit, good reception, record TV programming on 4 hour mode looks and sound good. Unit takes time to turn on must be patient. There is a mode that keeps power to unit so it responds quicker, but that costs extra electricity. Occationally unit will freeze and you have to press the reset button. Overall I'd buy it again."
4,"Great Product, Easy To Use","Hi there, I've owned this DVD recorder for over 2 years now and I love it. Mine was a refurb but you couldn't really tell. I have recorded large amounts of DVD's. I converted tons of VHS movies to DVD and it has never failed. I used to own a Sony recorder and got rid of it after a lil' while because of the large amount of ""coasters"" that it created. I would've given this DVD recorder 5 stars if it wasn't for those rare occasions where the DVD product shows ""tracking"" issues that weren't present on the VHS format. Please not that this happens on very rare instances."
2,Good when it worked,"I have used the DVR daily for just over a year.Pros:DVD RAM format superior to +/- RDigital TunerOverall featuresCons:No HDMI on this model (some have it)Slow (annoyingly so) to change channelsUnreliableProne to lock-ups requiring resetsWho should buy this unit? Avoid this unit, especially used ones.The unit regularly crashes requiring a reset. It does this about once a month. This was okay to deal with. Just after a year of owning it the unit refused to eject a cassette I had checked out from the library. I searched the internet and found this was a common problem. I opened the DVR and manually ejected the cassette and it was fine, turned out it was a jammed cassette (I don't know why it couldn't eject it instead of throwing error codes).A week after the cassette problem, the unit failed to eject a DVD. Same problem, looked on the internet and saw this was a fairly common problem. No electronic device should be this much fuss, especially one that cost me $280 new."
5,Panasonic,"I am very pleased with this product. Everything has worked well. Quality or recordings and playback are both very good. I was especially glad to find a good instuction book with it. It is very detailed and is good at referring you to other pages if you need more info. I took a simular unit from a different manufacturer because I couldn""t get it to work properly. Instruction book was poor."
1,Poor purchase,"I purchased this item to hold files in my office.It is very flimsy, and didn't last a month. I DO NOT recommend this item for purchase."
3,1951 book has its drawbacks,"Mine is the earlier 1951 version of this book. I purchased this book because I enjoy all sorts of embroidery and thought it might discuss Norway's hardanger stitching. But it doesn't. What is good about the book is that it has a detailed discussion of lace from its inception to contemporary times accompanied by how each type is made, where, and since when. I was surprised to see just how many types of laces there are: 50 are listed. There is a good discussion of how to spot machine lace from handmade. B&W; photos accompany the text. What is not so good about the book is there is no table of contents, index, chapters, bibliography or source of information. It focuses almost exclusively on France and Belgium with brief mention of other countries in Europe.This book fills a very fine notch in an embroiderer's library. Only the most devoted would find it useful."
2,"Product failure, worn three times","Wore these three times for some recreational ball. They appeared to be well made and were very cofortable. On the fourth time out, the bottom of the shoe separated. Had to grab a roll of duct tape for an emergency short term solution to prevent injury."
2,"Cute in the drawer, terrible on the body!","These things are NOT comfortable. They ride and the tags are placed so that you get a constant aggravation from them. Removing the tags helped, but did not eliminate the poor quality of the material which also rubs."
4,If ya like this...,"All the folks saying they sound like Big Head Todd--it's not a snub, just a tribute to the greatness of Todd. TO all folks who like Indigenous: be sure to get Todd's Sister Sweetly--it's a flawless album. Every song is awesome."
5,These kids are the real deal!,I just saw Indigenous perform live here in San Francisco at The Palace of Fine Arts and Club Cocomo! I was Blown away by them!!!! They have soo much soul and heart! Purchasing thier CD is the best $20.00 you will ever spend! ---a 19 year old who does not even like blues but loves them now
2,Deceptive Title for this book,"As a professional I am very disappointed by the contents of this text as the title is very misleading.The suggestions and advice contained in the book is elementary not at all implied by the title.Much of the information is related to the experiences of the authorand that which works for him.It is also too generalized and not specific enough.The enclosures of taking a course or ordering hypnosis material from his institute gives the intent of writing this book,away.I am truly dismayed.There are far superior books on this subject to be had."
2,Some quite useful information but....,"mostly a rehash of free articles available on the author's website and a promotion tool to sign up for his 5 Path training. There is pratical and useful descriptions of organizing your practice and making good initial impressions.The author describes the first 2 of his 5 ""paths"" including age regreassion in great detail and then invites the reader to sign up for training to learn about the final 3 paths. I respect Mr. Banyan as a hynotherapist and businessman, but writing is clearly not his best talent. This book is poorly written and there are several typos, which is unprofessional looking. The author has also employed a hypnotic writing technique at the start of each chapter that states everything ""you will learn"" in the following chapter. It is annoying and time consuming. I don't want to be told what I will learn, just give me the information.While the book has some merit, most of the information can be gatehred by reading the free articles on his website."
2,lucille starr,"Not the same ethos as ""The French Song"" nevertheless thankful to Amazon that it was available"
5,Awesome old time instruction,"This golf instruction book is one of the best for any beginner. It rivals Harvey Pennick's little red book,maybe. It breaks everything in your golf swing down to the basics. Oh, and it's only less than $20.00!!"
1,Arrived Broken,"I ordered this as a cute way of serving snacks for my daughters Girl Scout Daisy troop. It is very cute, but mine arrived broken as well. I am reordering, and hopefully the next one will arrive with better packaging."
1,Daisy Dip Bowl,I love daisies and was really excited to see this product. My daisy bowl arrived in a million pieces and had to be returned.
3,e250 adaptors,the product did what it was supposed to at a reasonable price. i have no complaints regarding value for what i paid for it. it was a replacement to oem.
2,You may not need this,"I am not sure why this product is necessary. I find that if I partially plug the regular USB cable into my computer, then I can listen to the player and recharge at the same time."
1,bad designed cable don't buy,I got this cable when we lost my husbands original cable while evacuated in the San Diego fires. He was so mad when the cable would not fit his sansa e260. the cable is about .5mm to wide for the socket in the sansaDont buy
4,great product,"if you wanna charge up your sansa, this is the product to buy, although the usb cord comes with the mp3 player when you buy it the wall and car chargers dont, this was a great price for a product you'll actually use"
2,poor quality,The wall charger has rattled since it came in the mail and I was worried about using it that way and the car charger fell apart within the first week. Luckily the only part I really needed was the usb connector which seemed to be pretty decent and so far havent had any problems using it with my other usb chargers.
1,no way,"Mack's is not a good book. Her scholarship is nonexistent and her writing is awkward. In addition she is an incompetent teacher, mean to her students and completely unencouraging. Ovid and Classics have suffered at her hands."
3,"Come on people, 1 star, give me a break!","I saw a rental. Did not buy. This movie started out slow, and dull, but once you get past that it wasn't that bad. Story line was okay (except for the ending), can yoe say, lame? Would I buy this? No! But the acting was pretty good for the most part, funny in spots and a truly hilarious CGI ship/storm sceen. It's worth at least 1 watch. Personnally I only purchase movies I am willing to watch more than once."
5,These are very good labels,These labels fit the Microsoft labels programs with ease. This particular size looks great with Lucida Handwriting set at #7 size type - keeping your address at 3 lines. I have used many styles of labels in my business - but Avery gives the best results. Try Avery's own program that you can download at Avery.com
4,A Convinent Way to Make Labels,I have printed these and the labels are a sized just right for me using 3 lines. If you want a big writing like 12pt font on 3 lines then look elsewhere. These will be around 8pt size depending on the font. The return address size matches what my Zebra thermal printer puts out for packages so these are very efficient for a cheap way to label a lot of mail. I used the online label maker that doesn't require any software downloads and it came out just fine for me. These labels are much cheaper than buying them pre-printed from most general websites.The Easy Peel feature is pretty nice. It exposes the one of the labels to allow for fast peeling without having to dig in with your fingernails.Unless you want these on a roll instead of sheets or want something fancy these are very cost efficient and practical.
5,They work.,"It's hard to review this type of product. They work, they did not smudge, and they are compatible with word. We also used some to cover up old file labels. They shipped and arrived quickly."
5,An earthquake under our feet,"As a student of the paranormal and as a theological student at Duke University, I am fascinated by this book. It is a far cry from the kind of junk we find littering the isles of Barnes and Noble stores and the like, where we come across book after book by exploitative writers like Dan Brown who cash in on people's ignorance and gullibility. The author of THE FOURTH WATCH does not wallow in speculation, or offer up fiction as if it were scholarship; he is honest and he has an analytical mind which he applies to the mysterious narrative known as St. Mark's Gospel. The results are an underground earthquake that has the power to -- and ought to--make the biblical philistines (literalist fiundamentalists) quake in their boots. The chapter on Demonic Possession and the 1949 St. Louis exorcism is revelatory. Why can't people learn the difference between charletans like Dan Brown and instead make the effort to apply intelligence to the sources of the Christian religion."
4,Knight of Knights,I do not understand how the guy from NC thinks this cd is weak. I personally think this is the best one yet. Ramsey and these guys really out did themselves this time. This is a must have cd if you know anything about jazz. Outstanding work.
2,Slow,"This camera has a good form factor and takes sharp pictures. Unfortunately, it is very slow. It often takes seconds for it to focus during which time you have missed the shot. I would not purchase this product for that reason."
5,"DSC W-50, really shows Sony's excellency!","While Sony's mp3 players are always sucking and un-friendly for use, Sony's digital cameras and camcorders are mostly excellent.This one is an outstanding example.1). Sharp and high quality image;2). easy use;3). long battery life.4). excellent movie function;5). compact enough to carry around.I have an old DSC S40, which I purchased at the begining of 2006. It is an excellent camera. This is actually the main reason that I want to upgrade my camera with another Sony cyber-shot. I first picked up a DSC S500, which is poor quality. In the end , I stay on this DSC W50. It did not make me disappointed.In one word, DSC-W50 is excellent, and deserves each cents you spent on it."
3,Decent camera but we're buying another one,"My wife and I bought this camera for travel and family photos. It may be that we just haven't figured out how to determine what settings are necessary but picture quality is not consistent. Landscape shots seem to be very nice even though we would like to have more zoom than 3x. Indoor shots have never turned out well for us. Very difficult to capture moving shots and some shots seem to have a lot of noise, especially in ISO setting. Camera is fairly intuitive and I love the size of it. But we're looking for a different camera after 3 years because we just can't take the bad pictures anymore.Pros:SizeLookBattery lifeQuick start-upGood landscape shotsCons:Inconsistent picture qualityPoor indoor shotsSlow shut-down"
3,be very still while taking pics,"The only thing that had me nervous when i first used it was that i had too many blurry pictures... i realized that the camera needed the person taking the pic to be very still, and my pics would then come out great...I am a sony product lover.. but i wish i would have brought another brand camera because who wants to or can be absolutely still on every single shot....i would not recommend this camera if you are not a camera person.. by the way it's really stylish..."
1,Breaking Out of the Pink-Collar Ghetto,"This book is statistical analysis only and does not provide any insight as to how women can break out of the pink-collar ghetto. After reading a Chicago Tribune article which highly recommended this book, I was under the impression that this book would offer solutions. It does not and unless you are a stastician, you won't make it through the first chapter. Very disappointing."
5,sturdy beach set,"I ordered this for a beach vacation with an 18 month old. It was very sturdy and had all the essentials needed for playing on the beach and in the water. Our set came with a blue bucket and a sand mold in the shape of a fish. I did pack the set in the suitcase and while I will continue to use it in the sandbox now that we are home, for the short amount of time that we were away, I wish that I would have just bought the $2 bucket/shovel at the local grocery store and used the extra room in the suitcase for myself."
5,My New Household Vacuum!,"I love this Shop-Vac so much that I do not have a regular vacuum cleaner anymore! I use this machine for everything from cleaning the cars to vacuuming the floors, and cleaning up spills. This one is better than previous shop facts because I have not had any problems with it falling over, or had any problems with the float getting stuck up at the top of the machine. This was a great buy, and has paid for itself many times over!"
2,Not classical. Not a symphony.,"I was disappointed that the music is not the ""original"" symphony score. It may be more ""childlike"" as arranged on this CD, but I want to expose my child to the symphony. I don't see a reason to dumb down the music.It is an understatement to say that Amazon's description of the product is woefully incomplete, because there is NO description. I thought that music classified as classical would be performed classicially. Apparently the previous reviewer likes the non-classical arrangment, but I did not realize the import of that review until after hearing the CD. Sadly, I cannot think of a way verbally to describe the music for other potential buyers, so caveat emptor.Also, I note that Amazon told me only one copy was left when I placed my order, and now only one copy is left again. Coincidence?"
4,One loud night at the Viper Room,"The loud and mysterious Masters of Reality resurface with this 1997 live set, mostly a mix of tunes from their first and second albums. Though Ginger Baker's not here (and wouldn't that have been a treat?) to dress up the songs from ""Sunrise on the Sufferbus,"" there's lots to recommend. ""Blue Garden,"" ""Doraldina's Prophecies"" and ""John Brown"" are great, the album's production is flawless, and Scott Weiland stops by the vocal mic on his way back from the bar. (Weird, but it works.) This band really created its own niche in the early 90s, and the album deserves better than it got -- that is, no promotion whatever. Then again, each Masters release has been on a different label (this one seems to be on ""Malicious Vinyl""), only adding to Chris Goss and the Masters' mysterious career. So it's no surprise that this is out of print currently, but it's a real find if you're a fan."
5,An a.m.azing homes.run!,"I must beray myself. I am a C.P.A., and I know A.M. Homes. Music for Torching is an a.m.azining homes.run. A Steppford Wives Alice in Wonderland. I related as a middle aged family man with a wife and two kids living in the subburbs but there is plenty everyone will relate to. I laughed, I cried, I fantisized and fantisized. I did not shave my head (read the book) but I lost 70lbs, and I got a tattoo. A book to enjoy, to contemplate."
3,Giving Her Another Chance,"The first novel I read by her was ""The End Of Alice"". I read it about seven years ago or so & swore I wouldn't read her again. (In fact, I couldn't even finish the book before I threw it out, considering to burn it!) But alas, my curiosity took over & here again, I am.OK, I could get through this. It wasn't draw-dropping shocking to me as ""...Alice"", but interesting to say the least. My favorite thing about this book was its vast array of flawed characters. Yes, I was grinning & laughing at times at the hilarity of it all. Probably more because of how this story mocked ordinary, american life. I don't think any of us can read this & not be able to relate to it on some level.I only gave it three stars mostly because of the end. I closed the book feeling down, depressed, & in need of a good scrubbing of my mind.Then again, I surmise this is exactly what Holmes wants to achieve from this book."
2,Couldn't finish,"The book was so dark and depressing, coupled with completely unlikable characters and a plot that meanders, it just didn't seem worthwhile. I really liked This Book Will Save Your Life (which prompted this purchase), but I was pretty disappointed in this book."
2,Kinda bland.,"This book dramatizes what happens when you realize that your life has been slowly creeping up to smother you. I'm still not sure if I am disliking this book because it is dark but without other rewards (e.g. supple prose, delicious epiphany) or if it has done it's job with unlikeable, miserable characters that you'd like to give a good shake. They all seem so stagnant that the author, at a loss for a conclusion, seemed to throw a big movie-of-the-week finale on the end. That, I am sure I did not like. Then again, was I supposed to take the ending with a big wink-wink? I like that even less. This book wasn't painful, but it wasn't a depressing delight either."
2,"So, where is the music?","The topic is by no means extraordinary nor the social satire. In life is impossible to avoid conflict and regardless of the location of the planet where you live you will find it. So here the couple feel that their existence is boring and meaningless, but if we look closer the reason for their drama, it is never really brought to life by the author. It does not seem to me that she wants to denounce anything in particular about human experience in suburbia, or to open the mind of the reader to issues that somehow live hidden before our daily lives. The burning of the house is an empty act that leads nowhere. To some degree it was not even necessary for the development of the story. Nothing in the book rings true, and that is the problem, the book might be fun to read but it fails to move you or to provide any type of insight. As always the praises that we see from the critics are just part of a marketing show."
4,A can't put down story,"Although not quite as good as her other books, Music for Torching has the same compelling nature. Holmes knows how to grab the reader's attention quickly, and hold it throughout the story. As dire and unredeeming Paul and Elaine's lives are throughout the first 9/10ths of the book, that was pleasurable compared to the heart-wrentching ending."
3,Easy beach read,"An easy beach read but not super challenging. Kept me entertained though. Reminds me of Franzen, in that all the characters are pretty self involved and unlikeable."
1,Dysfuntionality,"The book was terrible, the characters were insipid and not developed at all. The characters were dropped into the story in full dysfunction without any background of how they got that way. It was not a case of one or two dysfunctional characters, but an entire global universe of dysfuntionality.The book was ended with a terrible scene that did nothing to resolve any of the issues brought up in the story. In fact, not one issue brought up in the story was resolved. Even the ""blockbuster"" closing was left open-ended.All in all I found the book totally disappointing and unsatisfying. So much so that I will go out of my way to avoid books by this author in the future."
5,Delightful story,"This book is delightful. I love the collage type illustrations; you keep discovering more humerous detail. The text is appealing and sparse,the ending is a hoot. Loved it."
5,African Americans on Stamps,"African American on Stamps is in the class of, ""Best Sellers.""This books makes a great gift! If you are a parent of teacher having trouble getting your child or student to read, African American on Stamps is the answer. This book is student friendly!Fulled with colorful pages and useful information. The author takes his love of stamps and delivered a great history book!EMc"
2,OH DEAR OH DEAR,"when i looked at the pictures, i thought well what did you think...i thought it looked rubbish but decided not to be disheartened and test it before it came outthe gameplay and graphics just matched the pictures this is aweful please don't waste your money on itwait for something better from matrix games"
2,Did not ship Belkin cable!,"They work fine but they don't look like any Belkin brand cable I have ever bought before. They do not have Belkin logos or part numbers anywhere, even on the packaging. BEWARE!^@#&$&*"
4,comment about the introduction,"The book itself is wonderfully poetic, I share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers.The introduction by Mr. Winchester left an unpleasant taste in my mouth, however. Although I found the information about the political situation in Corfu at the time very interesting, further on he makes some totally unnecessary and condescending comments about the books of Gerald Durrell."
2,No Sizzle in Red,I have used 3M reflective tape before in different colors with good results. The red tape does not provide much in the way of reflective properties. I was disappointed.
4,could no longer find in stores,"Because this brand was no longer available at OD, I purchased their version which broke within a week. Then I shopped S and bought theirs, but it doesn't have a lip on the bottom so my papers constantly fell off (I don't use the clip on the top because I need to add and take away pages quickly). This particular item lasted about five years for me."
1,boring and dated,"My son, 6 received this magazine as a present. He never showed any interest in the magazine except for one game where he had to look for hidden objects. The stories did not appeal to him. The magazine did not appeal to me either. I found it very dated graphically. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,"Games, Stories",I love reading and doing the games/puzzles with my 5 and 7 year old. The games actually build spatial and reasoning skills in a non stressful way.
3,unpleasant customer service,"The first customer service person said the first issue was going to be sent on Dec. 1. We didn't receive it. The second person said it was sent to a wrong address, and he would sent it again. The third person said nothing was sent so far, and actually the Jan. issue is going to be the first issue we can receive. Not reliable customer service. I canceled the subscription."
4,Great magazine for children,Probably too old for my six year old on his own but packed full of great articles and pictures.
5,"Highlights for Children, better than I remember!","I was so excited to find this title on Amazon.com! My kids love this magazine and it's even more fun than when I was little. I still see this in all the doctor offices and now we can have our own copy at home! My children's teachers have recommended this to supplement their reading curriculum. My kids don't sem to notice that they are learning since they are having so much fun. I'll be glad to turn off the TV, the advertisements, and the games each month when my issue arrives. Thanks Highlights!"
2,Most disappointing of the Eddy-Mac musicals,"The story is so fractured......and much as I love Tosca......this is not the place for it. Some segments on their own are good, but it doesn't hang together as a whole. And the stupid totem song with the Indian segment was totally ridiculous. Leave it to Hollywood to screw up a good musical.For a fine musical with Jeanette as an opera singer, see Maytime."
2,Check this one out at the Library,I was not very impressed. Lots of poor choices in my opinion. Go to the library and after you page through it then decide.Also if you can visit a book store in an art museum and if they are not shrink wrapped you might find exactly what you want. This one left us flat and disappointed.
1,Crash Parade,"The few impressions I was able to catch in between two crashessemed not too bad.But how usefull is the best game when it causes fatal errors all the time?As long as there is no patch that reduces the numerous crashes (at least one every 10 Minutes), i would definitifely not buy this game."
5,Pricey but great,"I am on a reduced calorie low cholesterol diet and use this product heavily. It is a great way to get healthy soy protein (and some calcium to boot) without a lot of calories. The banana flavor (although artificial) is my favorite. I wish the Snack & Slim brand was available in banana as it appears to be the identical product with a different label at two thirds the cost. Of the Snack & Slim brand the vanilla is probably technically the best tasting, but I love chocolate flavored things, so it's a toss up for me. If you don't mind spending the extra money then you might like the Instone banana the best as I do. I have given this product to friends and some love it and some hate it. There is probably a sucralose (splenda) aftertaste but I don't really notice it. People's taste buds are sensitive to different things I guess. I think this tastes great, and it really makes my healthy diet work, so I'm hooked."
4,Gets the job done,"Decided to replace the non-functional software modem on my laptop with a real one, instead of reloading the entire Win/XP to try to correct the problem. Used mostly as an occasional backup since DSL available at home and WiFi most everywhere else. Economical choice!"
4,The Wilderness Campaign of WWII,"I didn't care for this book. I found it difficult to follow with a dry narrative. But as others have said, if you want the facts, they are contained within the pages of this book. It's awful to think that the America high command was so willing to sacrifice the lives of thousand of young GI's for no tactical advantage whatsoever. This costly battle should never have taken place! The men who fought there never flinched from their duty and are due are highest degree of respect and admiration. But it angers me to think the whole thing may not have been necessary in the scope of world events."
4,Nice Film,"Will this ever be released on DVD? I guess Deanna's films have lost steam. Deanna's first teaming with fading star Franchot Tone, second teaming with First Kiss star Robert Stack. She sings many songs-Perhaps, Beneath the Lights of Home, Old Folks at Home, and Thank You America. Also Love at Last! Can't forget about that one. Nice plot with Deanna in a more grown up role trying to seduce Franchot Tone. A film that holds up well despite its age."
3,Get what you pay for,"I only paid a few dollars for what could be considered a rare DVD, and the packaging leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not like I expected a mint condition product. The artwork will need to be replaced, but I'm fairly happy. Thanks."
4,Blossom Toes..not your average Psych. group.,"The ""We Are Ever So Clean"" cd is really somthing out of the ordinary, but has a certian charm to it. The Blossom Toes are a group you actually have to appreciate, because they were not anything like there fellow UK Psych. groups, They had their own sound that when you first hear it you may not like, but it will grow on you the more you listen to it. It is a good CD, but I woulnd't recomend it for the average Psych. fan, if u are like me and wanna appreciate the oddities of the Psych. music world, this is a cd for you."
1,Not worthy of the Close Combat legacy,"If I were Eric Young, I wouldn't want my name to be associated with Squad Assault. Suffice it to say that I am a huge fan of this kind of games and of WW2 in particular and I couldn't get interested to finish one battle. Not only is it far from anything comparable to the CC series, this is supposed to be an improvment over GI Combat which itself was a major flop. It turns out to be inferior to GI Combat in many ways, particularly the battle graphics. This game is not worth its price, save your money and look for something else. I wish I did."
5,Think 3 Stooges/Monty Python do Jihad,"Funniest movie I saw last year... heck, funniest movie of this year, too. You will want to see it a couple of times. This is Monty Python ""Holy Grail"" territory. This is one of my all time favorites. A true diamond. Truth be told, it is not for everyone. It is a dark subject and it is not all laughs. Watch this with an open mind and you will love it. Absolutely BRILLIANT!!"
1,Snap Circuits music Box,This Product is not so good because it only plays happy Birthday. I have tried it.
3,A muddled conspiracy novel,"I went into this book with an expectation of 'an end-of-the-world' scenario with suspense and a solid plot. This novel is a better attempt but it has several lapses in keeping up the suspense and trying to add too much. At one point, biblical prophecies,secret societies, religious organization-engineered plots, aliens, political power plays, economic, natural, and social upheaval are all thrown into the mix. All this confuses one and makes one stop reading to try and find out the direction of the novel. It is a a decent read but it takes close to 150 pages for the reader to get where this may be going. Even then, I was not satisfied. The plot and feel of the book is best summarized by a main character, Father Deauchez' statement: ""You fear massive death and destruction, so you cause massive death and destruction!"" In this case, add confusion."
5,A real page turner,"What a suspenseful and timely book! The author weaves an intelligent and complex plot into a tight mystery that is a real page turner. I enjoyed every page of intrigue. She brings alive a colorful cast of characters, all with their own agendas- from a charismatic leader of a religious right fringe group to a conservative scientific septic from the Vatican- and all personalities in between.The story is timely in terms of articulating many of the popular prophetic issues surrounding the ushering in of the new Millenium. Jensen's book not only entertains, but also causes the reader to pause and reflect on his or her personal beliefs, thereby preparing themselves spiritually for the new age.I hope to read a lot more in the future from this talented young author."
4,Helpfull for FMG!!,"Excelent source of updated information, specialy in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I liked the well-organized, system-based content of this book, but it's a little wordy and I've found several mistakes. Even though, I would recomend it to any Foreing Medical Graduate prepearing for the STEP 1. ( I scored high with this one and First Aid )"
3,"A Mediocre plot, but an all around good book.","Rick Hanson did a good job with this one although it lacks the suspense of his other ones. Mortal Remains is a unoriginal plot, but theres a couple twists in the story. For fans of murder mystery's this is a fun book, but for anyone else I don't recommend it."
4,Good mix,I love to hang out at a Zydeco joint and watch the people dance. Love the crawfish dishes too. I ordered this album for the Zydeco music. They throw in some jazzy pieces and some old rock and roll. They are good instrumentals but I wanted all Zydeco. Thus only 4 stars.
5,great!,I got it really fast and in good conditions really good and it was the mouthpiece that i saw not other model :D
2,so so,"I was disappointed in this product but I guess I am mostly to blame. I was under the impession that it was like the I-Fish and would connect to an I-pod and move with music. It does not. It has nothing at all to do with an I-pod. The name and packaging are very misleading. After spending some time trying to connect it, I did find in very small print on the packaging that it does not connect to an I-pod."
3,starting to stink,"I like Bust-A-Move, but I went from playing the classic to the new one and this one kinda stinks. First of all, they made all colorful pink and pretty with flowers and stuff. Second, the classic sound effects are replaced with a yelling Japenese girl! I t is so annoying. I recomend the SNES Bust-A-Move and I strongly recomend Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition for the Nintendo 64. They may be hard to find, but it is better than this."
3,OK but not perfect,"These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. However, for my application, I need to fed one sheet multiple times, as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately, with these Avery labels, after I feed them a couple times, the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet, but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So, if you plan to print one sheet at a time, this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time, look for another product."
2,Not for reuse.,"I'm the one who still uses videotapes. I record the tv shows I want to watch and after I've watched them I erase the label and then record more shows. These labels are fine for writing on permanently with ink, but no good for writing on in pencil, and the light pencil scratchings I'm able to put on them won't erase. Thus, no good for my purposes."
3,poor service,"I had no problems until the yogurt maker arrived. It came with a cracked lid on one of the jars. I contacted the company I purchased it from who suggested I contact Salton, but didn't provide contact information. I tried using the information on the owners manual but it no longer worked. The internet came up with dead ends. Frustrated I went back to the Purchasee who has not done anything to find a replacement for the lid.The yogurt maker works fine but I'm upset about having a cracked lid which is sure to break in half soon with no attempt to rectify the problem."
4,6oz baby-food jars fit perfectly,"I could easily make yogurt without this unit in the oven with the light turned on, but I like the convenience of the little jars to take to work.I wanted to be able to make more yogurt before finishing up the original 7 jars and searched for jars that would fit. Finally discovered that the 6oz babyfood jars fit well. They are cheap and the lids fit better than the original jar lids.The only complaints I have is that it gets pretty hot and the lids do not fit perfectly.It is a simple, no frills yogurt maker that makes fine yogurt (even with the heat issue)."
5,"Good product, poor shipping","This yogurt maker looks good and probably makes great yogurt. When the box arrived, one glass was broken and one top was cracked. I reported this to dollarsays and they gave me excellent service. I would recommend buying from dollarsays."
5,Odd Combination of Contents Makes for Useful Book,"It's really two books. The first part consists of excellent instructions on how to use the Internet. The second part consists of an excellent listing of on-line resources which would be of assistance to anyone in the criminal justice field, including students.Robert E. Keldgord, Consulting Criminologist, Sacramento,CA"
3,A collection of daily comics,This is merely a collection of the daily comics they e-mail to people or you can view at their website. It doesn't contain anything about John and Liz getting together.
5,Max Freedom Long did it again!,"I read Mr. Long's original book ""Recovering the Ancient Magic"" and gave it high praise.This book has many of the same case reports that were published in ""Recovering the Ancient Magic"", but This volume goes more in depth than the earlier work. so buy this book instead. This is an excelent study in Huna!If you have questions or comments E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda."
5,travel,"For a trip to Australia, this is an excellent guide. It lists all places of interest, hotels and restaurants. discusses money and special events. Photographs are also excellent. I would recommend this"
4,GLAD TO SEE THEM BACK TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME,THIS IS JUST WHAT FULL FIGURED WOMEN NEEDED TO BOOST A LOT OF EGOS. FULL FIGURE WOMEN LIKE MY SELF LIKE A LITTLE REALITY. ALL THESE STORIES WERE TRUE TO FORM. ALL FOUR WOMEN ARE MY FAVORITE WRITERS. WITH IN ONE YEAR I HAVE COLLECTED THERE BOOKS AND HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED THEM. THEY HAVE ANOTHER ANTHOLOGY HIT ON THERE HANDS.
5,Wonderful!,"You can never go wrong with a Mayer book. They are so fun. Always told from a child's point of view, you can't help but laugh at all the mishaps throughout the book and the innocence in which it is told. In this particular book, Little Critter goes camping with his dad and tries soooo hard to help out but somehow always manages to create a minor disaster. Add in a little 'treasure hunt' of spotting the spider and grasshopper in each picture and you've got quite a little treasure in itself. So, cuddle up with your little audience and enjoy!"
5,Great Book for Toddlers,"My 2 year old loves this book. She enjoys reading all of the books about Little Critter. This book is her favorite because of the bear and Little Critter's dad. I enjoy reading this book to her since the story is simple enough for her to understand, yet it is still imaginative and fun. She also enjoys sitting and telling the story to her father while looking at the pictures. I would recommend this book to children 2 and up."
4,Mercer Mayer Books as a new tradition,"When my 3 sons were little, they constantly begged me to read all of Mercer Mayer's books to them, but especially Just Me and My Dad. Now that my oldest son is grown and has a 3-year old daughter of his own, it has become her personal favorite. Children love the adorable characters and the humor contained in all of Mayer's books, even at very young ages. A great, easy to read bedtime story for all children!!"
3,Cerebus goes experimental,"Whilst the first part offered great art and a coherent , poignant narrative, this second part, whilst it has the great art of gerhard, it's convoluted, heavyly symbolic and cerebral. Really, the first volume would have sufficed.I give this ""phone Book"" three stars only for Gerhard's art."
2,does all right for some things,"Ok for books that stay open by themselves, less than about 2 inches thick. Works okay as a laptop holder if the laptop is around 5 lb or less. Page holder clippy things fall off."
5,cleverly designed,"The Fellowes copyholder is just what I had been looking for. I like to read at the table, and this device holds up my book or magazine at just the perfect angle. It unfolds and re-folds easily and quickly. Each time I re-fold it, I admire the clever way the parts all fit together.Just one cautionary note: It's not meant for big heavy volumes, and it has to be treated with a certain amount of care. There's a trade-off between making something lightweight and easily portable, vs making it rugged, and in this case the designer leaned in the direction of lightweight and portable. In my view, it was the right decision. I'll treat my Fellowes Copyholder with respect, and if someday I drop it or sit on it and it breaks, I'll promptly order another one from Amazon."
1,poor quality,"looks great until it arrives.its not strong enough to hold my book, it falls down every time!it is very fragile plastic and seems to be able to break easily.im very dissapointed!"
4,Just what I needed.,"Grea for basic student use. I have a thick manual on the holder and it doesn't break or anything. The front two hinge that holds the book in place is easily pop off but its also easy to pop back in. For the price, is it the simple basic book holder a college student needs."
4,Good bookholder,"I've started to learn guitar with Roger Evans'How to Play Guitar. I needed a book holder so I can read the book while playing.It's amazingly difficult to find a book holder at a low price with good reviews. This one fit the bill, though.When I got it, I was a bit disappointed with the cheap feel and look of it but it does what it's supposed to do. It holds the book in place and has a couple of tabs to keep the pages from flipping on you (before I got this, I was using a photo frame holder and a binder clip to keep the pages from flipping, so this is a welcome improvement).I do wonder about it's longevity, though. I'm guessing that the tabs that keep the pages in place will wear out and loosen over time, since they're just plastic and snap into place. An improvement would be to make these metal and some screws to tighten them down if and when they do start to get loose.At any rate, it's well worth the price as is. If it wears out, I can just buy another one for this price."
4,Fellowes Book Lift Copyholder,"Fellowes Book Lift Copyholder - For Use with Textbooks and Large ManualsI received this a couple of weeks ago and have used it periodically. For the price, it is a good tool for books up to just short of 1 3/4 inches thick. I don't know that it qualifies for large manuals and have not found it helpful for that, with the tabs on the bottom of the product. The tabs are about 1 1/4 inches and suppose they could be manipulated to accomodate larger reading material, but have not tried that yet. I would recommend the product with the above limitation."
4,Good Information,This is a pretty good source of information on Voi. Clear and precise instructions and its fun to try and not hit yourself in the head with the poi while learning to control it :)This is a great dvd for 1st timers.
2,Good idea but cheaply made,"I really think this a cute toy but it is so flimsy and seems like it will break very easy. When its closed up as a mac truck it doesn't latch together well, so when my son goes to push the truck it pops open. Every time you open it, you have to reassemble the ramps and ledges. They also just lay there loosely and fall off often. The plastic is hard and thin so it seems very brittle. If it were made better, this would be a great toy!"
1,About as original as an ever lovin' q-tip!!,"I feel so misled! You see a video on MTV and you like the song. You buy the album, assuming that you'll be at least almost as pleased by the remaining ten songs or so. You have been duped...at least if you bought this album. I know this because I made that very mistake. Every song is worse than the previous one, and the song titles are even worse....'Sexual Sandwich'..what the hell is that!? The Flys are this year's Sugar Ray. I can't think of a worse insult than that."
2,"ok, the flys....","wel i was turned on to this song at a strip club when 2 lipstick lesbian dancers were doing what they do best to each other. i got you where i want you was the best piece on this cd the rest of the songs didnt strike a buzz with me though. i listen to it with fond memories of those two hot chicks that night at the bar, so i gave it 2 stars for the girls & the song.this is a one hit wonder cd or a good beer drinking cd at a frat party in collage...."
3,"Weird stuff, man.","Does anybody remember this band? Probably not, but I'll review them anyway. I remember hearing my girlfriend listening to this CD like 2 or 3 years, ago, and I was just like ""uh, ok"". This has got to be one of the weirdest bands I've ever heard. It's kind of alternative type music, but then there's kind of rapping, and the lead singer sounds exactly like Ozzy. Well, maybe that's a stretch, not exactly like him, but the first thing you will think of when you hear him is ""Dude, that sounds like Ozzy!"". In fact, this guy actually did a cover of ""Suicide Solution"" on a tribute album, and it's actually pretty good. But his voice totally doesn't fit this kind of music at all.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm really not sure what to think of it. It's not good, it's not bad, it's just, well, weird."
1,TERRIBLE BINDING!,"I have two reviews for this book, but the most essential piece of information I can offer is that this book is very shoddily made - upon reading the book only once, it now looks like a well loved used book. Sections of pages cracked right out of the binding. Also, the edition has some strange text/typing issues which didn't bother me as much, but by all means spring for the other, slightly more expensive version.I won't expound with a full review here, however this book is worth reading, especially to die-hard Balzac fans (of which I'm one). Learning that the piece was culled from unrelated stories made the somewhat shaky plot lines defensible, but it's strength is in just a few fantastic passages on women and age. A short read with some gems of prose - and how can you beat plot twists involving pirate queens? You'll see . . ."
2,Not a best of at all..but a low point,"Christina Milian is still young enough, talented enough and beautiful enough to gain fame for all these attributes. She's had modest success as an actress and singer and its a shame her ex-record label has released this CD inplying she's done.Clearly she's not ready for a ""Best Of"", especially a CD that does not collect anything other than whats on her records. She's had songs on mixtapes and soundtracks and none are found here. So who'se going to buy this? Clearly no one, as those interested in her one worldwide smash (""Dip It Low"") have already bought the single and the fans have nothing here for them to grab.Hopefully her career will rise from these ashes and this CD will be seen as her lowest point in her career."
1,Robert Did Not Act Alone,"Only the residents of Valley Stream & the Five Towns in Long Island know more than any DNA testing, or evidence gathering by the Nassau County PD!!Robert did not act alone ... where is the evidence on the others? Did he perchance cover-up after brother & friend?? My daughter dated the *friend* after the incident ..Matter-of-fact .. last checked the *friend* is a basket case {{from psychiatric > thorzine > GUILT}} ... so why is Robert the only one in jail?Did he perchance take the fall for the others? Or was Nassau County's precinct & detectives negligent?"
2,senseless,This was a very sad and tragic story. I have to say i was very excited to read this book as I am a huge true crime fan. The book was not at all suspensful to me. The book just drags and drags as you wait for something to happen and it never does. I did not care for this book.
1,This books needs an author!,"Against Her WillThis book was a disappointment. Of course, the murder of Kelly Ann Tinyes is an abhorrent tragedy and my heart goes out to her family for the suffering they have endured for nearly 24 years. But the man who wrote this book and his editor did a horrible job with the writing, proofreading and editing. It was difficult to read not only because of the subject matter, but because it did not flow. Simple mistakes were made using the wrong words. For example, in one spot where the word ""year"" should have been in a sentence, instead the word ""war"" appeared. The book is absolutely not worth the $4.99 that I paid. I will be buying nothing further written by Ronald J. Watkins."
4,Alternative Glam?,"The previous reviewer is right. It's very hard to compare this band to anyone. Their music has some elements of funk-metal in it, but almost ventures into hair metal territory. Combine that with 90's alternative rock and then you've got Luv Junkies.Their songs are solid and the musicianship is very good as well. Unfortunately for them, ""Smudge"" was released about 5 years too late. Had this album come out in the early 90's, Luv Junkies could have been the next Faith No More(truly a genre crossing band). As it stands, ""Smudge"" is a great album. One that still gets frequent visits to my CD player."
2,DNA testing is needed,"I think they tried to clone Avril and something went horribly wrong. Yes, please, for god's sake show us 'One Original Thing.'"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"not a single chord, note, or beat out of place, nothing that isn't utterly rigid, monotonuos and predictable. like maybe she/they could have switched up the strumming pattern from one chord to the next sometimes, or put in the occasional drum fill so you can at least tell it isn't programmed."
2,"beautiful but not exciting, i want the full length of this ballet!","it was very exciting to watch raymonda ballet, and im a fan of paris ballet opera, i almost have the complete collection of paris opera ballet dvd. but when i purchase this item i was very discourage! im expecting more superb performances, cause the cast are my favorite dancers, i was hoping that i can watch the full length production of this ballet, but what i see is a sort of documentary. So i can rate it only for 2 stars, im so sorry for this. But i think if they could release the full length of this raymonda ballet. Well i think! they are more excellent compare to the other ballet companies!"
3,A photo history of the Eastern Front.,"OK, the photos are great and the lead in for each of the five years is a nice summary of the war, but a reader might not be able to figure out why these two nations went to war in 1941. Photo books are great in conveying some information, but a historian would need more than this to determine why Communist Russia and Nazi Germany were dire enemies. The photos convey the massive brutality of the aspect of the war. Each country hated each other, and they inflicted immense sufferings on the citizens of the other country.This is an OK read and review of the Nazi-Soviet War. One should go elsewhere for further information on this historic clash."
5,Hip hop at its best,"Overall, a deep album with different subjects for all people to love. Its an eye opener to personnel who go through the same issues stated in this material. Well worth the money and music I can pass down to my kids. Thanks"
3,Prequel to the sequel,"Dairy Queen is about a girl named D.J Shwenk. D.J works hard on the family farm and has no time to waste on the stuck-up quarter-back named Brian, not to mention the fact that he's from a competing school! But when a family friend sends him her way to train him, she couldn't say no. She ends up spending most of the summer with him, and learns to love not only football, but the quarter-back as well. Unfortunately, the book didn't stand up to its intriguing setting, and it wasn't as good as I had anticipated. Between a lot of information about the hardships of farming, football, and a dysfunctional family, you always knew the book would end in a classic love-story. This made the story a bit addicting because you really wanted to get to the end of it to experience the happy ending. Unfortunately the story is anti-climatic and ends up just being a prequel to the sequel.Overall I like the author's tone and the book was a nice read, but the ending was very disappointing."
1,Another Trash from 70s..,"Have ever heard about a film genre called ""erotic politics""? If want to see how can a very serious issue like the Middle East crisis can be combined with an erotic x-rated theme.. then you are welcome to watch this trash. This movie may also interest people who want to see a bunch of the 70s stars from Egypt, Lebanon and Kuwait enjoying acting with the (completley nude) Nahid Sharif. Don't be surprized to see the famous ""history actor"" Ezzat Al-Alaily in a hot bed scene with her!Look also for the Kuwaiti actors such as Ali Al-Mufidi and Mohammed Al-Mansour!"
4,good story,"I read this book because I took a class with the teacher at Duke last fall. Like other examples of fiction I have read recently, the storyline had a unique way of keeping me interested and intrigued, and in such a different way from non-fiction, biographies, or other genres. Fiction has a way of keeping me captivated when reading. I also like the work of Reynolds Price and I find some similarities between these two writers whom both work at the same school."
5,Great Historical Fiction,The Lanny Budd series is historical fiction about a young man who spies for the US while befriending Hitler under cover as an international art dealer. A wonderful read as well as educational.
4,Atomic Train was a surprise blast.,I took a chance on buying the movie Atomic Train. I have never seen it before or knew anyone that has. I based my decision on the title and the reviews I read on Amazon. Knowing that it was a made for TV flick my expectations was low. I have watched the movie twice now and I am glad I bought it. The basic story is a stowaway nuclear bomb on a runaway train. Will the train crash and set off the bomb? I will not give much away but to say there are a few surprises. Being a TV movie you have your soap opera elements but not as bad as I had expected. The special effects are good and the acting decent. There is a short making of the movie on the DVD. If you like trains and action you probably won't be disappointed.
3,Slow tempos,"The thing that struck me most about this recording was that the tempos were slower than I'm used to on some of the numbers. (A lot of the tempos are fine, but certain numbers are quite slow.) To let you know where I'm coming from, my all-time favorite recording of Messiah is John Eliot Gardiner conducting the English Baroque Soloists and the Monteverdi Choir on Philips, and he's known for his brisk tempos. I got this recording because it's one of the only German language recordings of Messiah available, plus I'm a Peter Schreier fan. The recording was made in 1973, so you wouldn't expect much in the way of period performance practice. The orchestra and chorus are big, although there is a slight nod to performance practice in the use of harpsichord. They manage to fit the entire Messiah onto two discs with timings of 75:10 and 74:43. The recording is mid-priced, and I like the novelty of having the Messiah in German."
5,Great book,This book is a big help for me as a teacher of 2-3 year olds. It is difficult at times to teach the children to get along
4,clean gutters safely,my gutters are 15ft high & 5ft from the fence. I clamped the wand to atelescoping roller painting pole and was able to clean the gutters whilestanding on the ground. I could not see the inside of the gutters as Iwas working but did several passes and this got the job done. I had aladder on the end to go up & check progress. For me the biggest advantagewas working from the ground and not risking a fall while working on theladder or roof.
3,Gutter Cleaner,"This gutter cleaner is fine on small particles.In my case, it wasn't powerful enough to move along any of the clumps of leaves that had accumulated in the gutter and if you go by the directions the water comes showering down on you. Turning the nozzle to the left or right worked better and I stayed more dry.Overall, it's decent if you have a small bits and pieces, but I still had to climb onto the roof and clean the gutters out by hand.Look for this item at our yard sale this summer! LOL!"
3,Goodo but not great,"The Gutter Wand works better on television than it does at home. It can take several tries to get through heavy dirt build up, leaves, and other plant material. It does do the job it says it will do. It cost more to ship than it did to buy, which is another black mark as far as I am concerned. Over all I am glad I have it and will use it."
3,Size listed was too small,"Size listed was too small for my head, but my son loved it even though it was supposed to be for me. Recommend one size larger"
5,Dennis Brain Is Always Worth Five Stars,"Perhaps the greatest horn player of all time, Dennis Brain died at the age of 36, but fortunately for music lovers everywhere he left an abundance of recorded works to treasure and savor. This CD is a collection of 15 pieces recorded by Brain in the 1940s when he was still quite young. The performances (particularly of the Mozart and Strauss pieces) are magnificent in every way, and deserve to be in the collection of any classical music devotee.In every regard these are five star performances, but understand that due to the age and condition of the original source recordings, there is a degree of background noise present that listeners of modern digital recordings will find unfamiliar. The background noise isn't particularly objectionable, I just note here that it exists; don't let this issue dissuade you, though: this is an absolutely beautiful CD and deserves to be listened to repeatedly."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I had been looking all over for this CD, and it wasn't available on Amazon. So I chose to purchase a ""Used"" copy. I was so excited to get it, it didn't matter what price I paid. Once I received the CD, I was anxious to open it and listen to it. Well this is why I rated it a 1 star, because the CD was ""scratched"" and especially the song I was anxious to hear which reminded me of my now husband. So, after that point, I said I would never choose a ""Used"" item again, because you don't know what you are getting. And I paid a lot too!"
5,Earth-Shattering Presentation on Church Leadership,"This book devastates the modern understanding of church leadership. With Biblical scholarship, it shows how the modern pastoral role and denominational system is unscriptural and harmful. And it takes a very fresh look at what leadership and authority were in the first-century church. This is must reading for anyone who has been hurt by the present church authority structures."
4,"Intense, fast paced action/adventure!!","A personal war between two American military heroes is about to break out in the hills of rural Kentucky. David Morrell delivers a solid, intense, action/adventure. Morrell digs deep into the characters of John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran pushed to the edge by Wilfred Teasle, a Korean war veteran and now chief of police of Madison, Kentucky. Col. Sam Trautman joins the life and death struggle through the woods, hills, and caves as the body count rises. Make no mistake; this is a very different story from the film version starring Sly Stallone. A great fast read. Very entertaining with some great chase sequences and awesome ending."
3,Lots of Killing,"This would be a good gift or good read for someone who saw the movie. It's always interesting to see what the author wrote versus how the movie was made. The ending of the book is very different from the movie, and the book has many killings whie the movie has only one, and that's an accident."
4,Fun Toy,"These could be used as speakers in non-traditional ways (vibrate your car door panels instead of cutting holes for speakers, use your trash can for a speaker...), or you could use the them in a science project. Either way, for $20 they are fun to play with."
4,"Hey, where's that sound coming from?","These speakers are wonderful! They don't necesarily work with everything you'd think they would, but when you find something they do work on, they are great. I found that they best work on pieces of cardboard. lean them up against the wall and the space between creates a mini woofer for bass. If you want a cheap but great sounding pair of speakers, these are it!"
4,Travel The World With Barney and Learn Along the Way,"Loved getting to travel in a hot air balloon with Barney in this DVD.From Spain to Italy and all over!!!Not only did we learn things that related to that particular geographical location, we also were able to learn the local language!!!All while having fun!"
5,My Favorite,"This has been my favorite perfume for many years, but it is hard to find. You can get it in some stores, but they like to lock it up. I don't like spending time for a salesperson to unlock it for me. Easier to just order it here!!"
3,Doesn't Seem The Same.....,"I ordered 4 bottles of Skin perfume from Parfumes de Coeur, who now makes the product. I think it smells very different than the original Bonne Bell version. So does my husband, who noticed it right away. I am very disappointed, as I still have 3 1/2 bottles to use......"
5,Skin Musk Cologne,"I received my order in just a few days. It was packaged very good sothe glass was not able to break. I was very happy with my order and thequick delivery. Thank you, Patty"
4,"Grizzly G0453 15"" Planer","Best value for the money. Takes a little setup -- actually, quite a bit to minimize snipe."
2,Bloomfield's potential is not showcased here,"Maybe I'm wrong. I haven't listened to it in several months, so I'll give it another try later. My initial impression was that of disappointment. Too much slide (I've never cared for Mikes slide playing), and his straight guitar work is too few and far in between, and very tentative sounding at best. It makes one wonder if this was recorded during Mike's ""illness"" (out of respect I'll refer to it as such). After purchasing this, I ran out and bought the ""Don't Say I Ain't Your Man"" compilation, and was blown away by the excellent guitar playing throughout. It seems to be absent here. Maybe it's just me. Hmmm....."
4,"It's Not Killing Me, Either...","So Mike Bloomfield in the 1970s wasn't trying to be the hotshot blues virtuoso anymore? Big deal. You can do an awful lot worse than catch this disc (and, if you still have his KGB album or the Electric Flag reunion, you HAVE done an awful lot worse!), which catches him playing one of his periodic footloose gigs in and around San Francisco during the decade where he retreated back to the music and out of the spotlight. His slide playing isn't quite as grating as cracked up to have been, even if Elmore James he ain't. But the feeling remains, in abundance, and when he takes off the slide and lets loose with his customary lyric aplomb, you get a sense of a man at home with his music as he hadn't been for too long a time."
5,Captures the genius of his talent.,Mike Bloomfield as witnessed by many live was spellbinding. His talent for articulating the passion of the blues is without a doubt the most riviting. Unfortunately his recorded legacy only hints at this fantastic talent. This CD is very rare in that one is transported to an intimate setting where Michael plays with abandon. Further the quaity of thew digitally mastered tapes are crystal clear and his fellow muscians are out there all the way. Most muscians are aware and followed Mikes's insperation. Listen to this and you will also realize why he is considered a master of the guitar.
3,timeline to destruction,"this album is a necessary but depressing addition for bloomfield fans, it is jam sessions taken from 1974 to just shortly before his death. the timeline shows bloomfields decline as we get closer to the end. in his last couple of years insomnia and a lack of confidence in his own talent showed a steep and depressing decline, the slide playing is laughable and he is much of the time out of control with his normal leads.three stars for an important piece of history and some good music but overall a drag."
4,Bruce Fresh Finish,It is bringing luster to the floor after two coats. Will do another two coats in a couple weeks. If it doesn't work will have to contact Bruce about the floor.
5,Thumbs up!,Arrived in great condition and it is very sturdy!! I love it and it has given me great pleasure to drive around!
5,AWSOME,"Daniel has the most beautiful voice, and he can sing all types of music. I never was a lover of Rock N Roll in the 50's and60' But when Daniel sings them it is beautiful. I have 12 of his CD's and play them all day long and even in my car. I plan to buy more and also the vedios of his shows. Daniel is a FANTASTIC SINGER. I give him 5 stars plus, plus.Kathleen, Reno, Nv."
2,Huh!!!????,"What happend to the Ying Yang Twins? They went all soft on me with this one. Why are they rapping about hope and stuff I'm used to the bounce that booty girl music. The only songs that were good on this CD were the singles, WAIT and Badd. I waisted my money."
1,this is trash i'll give it 0 statrs,its only 2 good tracks on here number 10 and 15 because it feats b.gizzle now hes the hottest rapper in da south this cd its junk its not worth the money dont buy it
1,Not a current cable!,"After choosing the correct cable from the Belkin website, I carefully matched to this item, since the info was not a full description. The item number matched a new 2.0 USB 10' extension cable that I needed to use for a Belkin Plus Hub for printers and a scanner (also USB 2.0). I was shocked when I received this USB cable in a packaged marked as 2001 and only 1.1 capable. The image on this page is completely different that what I received. It even had a G3 iMac (blue) connected to an ancient USB hub on the back to show how the product needed to be connected. No wonder it didn't list a USB version."
4,Beautiful book!,"I love the illustrations in this book! Probably my favorite part.The story is cute, too (a little mouse who gets lost and the search party sent out for her). It's nothing outstanding, but cute enough, and the detailed pictures are sure to delight ""visual readers""It definitely has that ""classic children's book"" feel to it."
4,I like it,"First of all, I have to confess that I'm not her music fan at all, and all I knew was the song ""Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough"". But somehow I bought this CD, and I really like it. All songs are great."
1,Rip Off,"I have the Magic Bullet system and love it since there are only 2 of us in the household. I found the Magic Bullet Cookbook and thought it would have many more ideas...What a rip off! I don't know how the words MAGIC BULLET could be used in the title - unless it was written and copyrighted before the Magic Bullet we know of came out.Also, someone should have done some editing - grammar is horrible!!!I don't doubt the background of the author, but come on, there are so many better books out today.I wrote to the Magic Bullet people and am waiting for a response from them.DON'T BUY IT!"
1,NOT FOR THE MAGIC BULLET BLENDER!!!!!!!!,"I wish I had read the reviews on this book. It has NOTHING to do with the Magic Bullet Blender. Do not buy if your looking for a Magic Bullet Blender cookbook.It's not a terrible cookbook, but this author is getting a 1 star rating from me due to how misleading she is in her title."
1,Magic Bullet Strike-out!,The Magic Bullet Cookbook by June C. deSpain was extremely disappointing. The title lead me to believe that the cookbook would be using the Magic Bullet blender as a primary kitchen tool for most of the recipes. This not the case! I would not suggest this book if you are trying to kind a good recourse to use the your Magic Bullet blender.
1,Very Disappointing,"I adore anything that even comes close to being a retelling of one of my beloved fairytales. Silly, sentimental...I don't care I just love fairytales. I eagerly picked this book up at the library for a little light reading between exams and papers. Boy, was I disappointed! I felt horrid reading this stuff. I just could not finish it. I'm sorry, but I do not find it entertaining in the least to read about adults lusting after children...a theme found in several of the stories. Sleeping with the mother while attempting to seduce the young daughter. Feeling up a child who is clinging to you because she is afraid of the woods. Raping children!!!! This book makes me sad. I only gave it one star because I had to."
3,The 2 I ordered have defective on off switches,"Both of the on off switches broke, one arrived broken the other broke after less than 20 uses. What junk. I got this for the church so it is used three times a week. Called up Monster and they said to return them through amazon. Made In China things are either good or they are not depending on the quality control the outsourcing company sets up.This problem is common, just look at the other reviews.Use a power strip for the on off or make install an inline switch to the outlet they are plugged in to. Too bad the on off switch is not as good as the rest of the product."
5,A Great Value,"I love ordering from Amazon, thier prices are unbeatable and the delivery is so fast. The Monster Cable Power Center,Pro-900 was new as stated and packed very well, This was a def.needed addition to all my stereo equipment , Thank You"
5,should have gotten this a long time ago:,"if you have decent gear and are playing out or practice in a place with older electrical wiring, you really have no excuse to not get one of these. it protects your gear, it gives you piece of mind, and it looks sweet. i am happy that i finally got one."
1,One Star For Ash,"This ""Twister"" knock-off doesn't really offer much as everyone's favorite ghoul-killer plays it straight, chases storms, and seeks a little romance. It is great to watch Campbell in something other than a supporting role, but this is a TV cheapie. On the plus side is a strong supporting cast that includes Ernie Hudson (as Campbell's mentor).The DVD image is full-screen and nothing to write home about. There are no extras.So, I guess this one is for people who love Ash, couldn't watch ""Twister"" because of some dislike for Helen Hunt, or just buy anything with a special effect. Now when will ""Atomic Twister"" get released?"
4,It does come in a hard brick that u must soften,"so u have to know the day before that you will need it. On the other hand, the taste, well, makes regular brown sugar taste white. It is very syrupy and could be eaten as a candy. You decide if the price is worth it."
5,Simply great,I just bought it for my 27 months child before our last trip to Europe. It worked great. My son loved it so much that he wanted to use it also for riding in the city.It is very easy to use and it folds flat so you can put everywhere. Also it made very easy to push the chart with the luggages while pulling the trolley. I was stopped by som many moms and dads who were willing to buy it.It really changed my life.After one year and a half I am still travelling with it. My son is a big boy (114 cm and 20 Kg) and he still loves his red chair. I do not know how long I will be able to use it but for sure I'll miss it. Highly reccommended.
1,Pee,"I have 3 stainless steel lavatories in my home, one of which is this particular lavatory. Because this item has no undercoating and is single walled, it sounds like an elephant peeing in a wash tub when you turn the water on. (Yes, I do have an aerator on the faucet.) If you are hard of hearing this is the one for you."
1,COLORIZED Film Noir --AVOID AT ALL COST,"If you must buy this, get it for THE STRANGER, which appears to be the same sparkling transfer as on the stand-alone MGM disk.However Fritz Lang's WOMAN IN THE WINDOW is available on here ONLY in a colorized version. Might as well take crayons to an Ansel Adams print."
3,Halfway Decent,"The transfer for ''The Stranger'' (which is a great movie) is excellent, much better than some other releases. However, ''The Woman in the Window'' is COLORIZED!? Why? I have no idea. It's a Film Noir that relies heavily on shadows and darkness, which the phony color lacks."
2,Good Pix Boring Text,"Easter Island is one of the most interesting places in the world, but you would never know it from this text that is so much like geography textbooks of old that you don't want to even turn the page. What does keep you turning the pages are the pictures which are quite beautiful and, in themselves, illuminating... A worthy effort, with solid information..."
4,changed the way i think and eat,"""TOD"" is not an easy read, and a takes a bit of time to get into, but it's incredibly absorbing. I learned a ton -- about where our food comes from, how it's made and processed, and how ""organic"" isn't really all that ""organic"" or necessarily good for the planet. Reading this book has changed my food choices for the better and really made me think about what I eat and select.I'll tell you this -- I haven't had McDonald's in 9 months, and will never eat there again, not even in an emergency. (This healthy choice owed to this book, + the documentary ""king corn,"" which features Pollan; and ""Super Size Me"" and ""Fast Food Nation,"" which I also highly recommend.)Buy this book, and eat healthy!"
4,Informatinve,"Very informative and well written book. Makes you think. How can we live in agreement with the nature? Pollan shows that animal agriculture can operate in a way that respects the environment. And much, much more... Recommended reading."
1,A Waste of Paper,"This book is a long journey through many accusations, and little real substance. Michael Pollan devotes the first half of the book to criticizing the corporate agricultural machines of Cargill, ADM, and Monsanto, and the politics (subsidies) behind it all, but then weakly offers the solution as independent smaller farms utilizing a grass-based system versus the giant corporate machines utilizing a corn-based system. The fact that a McDonalds meal is actually 60% carbon molecules derived from corn doesn't tell me much. Is a carbon molecule derived from corn any less healthy for me than a carbon molecule derived from wheat, or from grass? A balanced diet in either case is probably what is essential. All conjecture, no medical facts or statistics. He then spends the remaining half of the book on his noble quest of killing a wild boar, and picking mushrooms, for his all natural ""gatherers meal."""
4,"Corn, corn & more corn","Interesting. Probably a must read for any one who consumes food in the US. A good picture of the ""organic"" farms and how they aren't so small."
4,It's complicated . . .,"I particularly enjoyed Pollan's account of the life of a steer bound for the dinner table. However, eating grass-fed beef is a little more complicated than Pollan indicates. We've raised grass-fed beef for years here in Maine, and its desirability seems to rise and fall with whatever food issue is ascendent. When red meat fell out of style, so did our beef. Now grass-fed beef is all the rage, but I doubt this trend will last, for this simple reason: grass-fed beef is leaner and more flavorful, but it also produces cuts of beef that consumers don't want to bother with---lots of pot roasts and stewing cuts that require gentler (and longer) cooking than a steak that's thrown on the grill. There's nothing ""fast food"" about much of a grass-fed steer. In short, a return to lean, local, and humanely raised meat requires a change in cooking habits."
4,Liked it More Than I Thought I Would,"I've been meaning to read ""Omnivore's Dilemma"" because I've felt like I should: If you're interested in books about food, this one seems unavoidable. I was hesitant because it's become such a lightning rod that I was concerned it was going to be a highly political jeremiad against modern agriculture, which I actually think is necessary to feed the world. Reading the book, though, it became clear to me that while Pollan certainly has strong opinions of how the world should work, he is not nearly so condemning of alternative views as either his supporters or detractors make him out to be.For this reason, I think it's a good read. Should Michael Pollan be made Secretary of Agriculture, and should this book be required reading in schools? Um, no. Let his supporters make those silly points. He himself is not silly, and I respect that."
5,Great Book - Quick Delivery,"I received the Audiobook quicker than I had anticipated which was great. I had a fourteen hour drive to make which is why I ordered it. I listened to the majority of it, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."
5,An eye-opening read.,"I really enjoyed this book, both as entertainment and brain food. MP is a terrific writer with a very natural, conversational style. He seems to approach the complex topic of where our food comes from in an honest, direct way without lecturing or idealizing. I've been questioning every food decision I've made since reading it."
1,Another Author Induges Himself in Unsustainable Musing,"This book, which repeats so much already published, basically follows through to its initial premise: that food in america is unsustainable. Along the way, the author indulges himself in great celebrity and ego stroking wit. The segment on the boar hunting is quite hypocritical. The main thrust of the author's theory is that all systems, including alternative, are unsustainable. The conclusion he avoids, is that the failure to find a solution will result in many deaths, if not the extinction of human culture as we know it. Perhaps, all that anyone can learn here is that it is hopeless, go back home, accept your fat and your fate, and try to die quietly. So many other books are better than this one. Unless you are a total newbie to these debates, you will find little that is refreshing here. The author basically finishes where he begins, with nothing but personal insights, and no insight into a broader solution for ""sustainable"" food sources."
2,Ok,"Umm you can watch a movie that is on the web that covers all the info that's in this book. I understand that we need to eat more sustainable products, and that we should stay clear of GMO food products. this book was a waist of money, and the info enclosed in its covers is readily available on the web. Any foodie should already know the information that is in this book.I'm a chef, and I guess this is a good read for a high school kid that's interested in the negative effects of humanity on the environment pertaining to food sources. I thought this book was more of a historical reference to the concepts behind the multiple course meal, I was wrong, hence forth the reason that I'm giving it 2 stars."
4,I'm eating up this info,"Easily more detailed and descriptive, this book covers much of what ""In Defense of Food"" covered and more. This book feels less like a crusade against the food industry and more like a discovery into how food gets to our table. He includes some fun stories about how he goes and actually gets involved with the farming, butchering, and hunting of food. It is truly eye-opening to get a little glimpse into what happens before the shrink wrapping. Hopefully I can pass to my children what food really is."
5,An eye-opener,"This is a truly marvellous book - a must read for anybody interested in knowing more about what they eat, where it originally came from and how it got to their plates. The sheer breadth of topics discussed is mind-boggling. The perils of modern industrial food production. The smokescreens behind which these dangers are hidden and those which we choose not to see. Until, of course, a salmonella infection hits us. The wastages involved in this process. Are big organic companies truly organic? How food ""grown"" on a small scale, in harmony with nature, is probably the best solution. On the scalability of these methods. What it takes to prepare a meal from scratch - yes, really really scratch. And, much more.There is no ranting, no speculation. Just cold, incisive analysis. Pollan's clarity of thought, elegant writing style and above all, his drive to keep asking questions until he gets to the root of the matter makes this book special."
3,Scary,"I love Michael Pollan's writing and agree with so many of his ideas but I had to stop reading because I was developing food issues. I'm reading ""In Defense of Food"" instead."
5,other uncomfortable truths,Michael Pollan has treated the subject of sustainable and heathy food with the respect and rigor that it deserves. He also tells a great tale of people's interest and action about their food that is truly engaging and instructive. A great read and a must read.
2,Should have stopped with Botany of Desire,"The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long book with the relevant content of an essay. After wringing as much as possible from the topic, Michael Pollan adds dozens of pages on his personal experience with a meal. This violates a time-honored elementary school writing lesson: Don't write about yourself because no one cares. Read The Botany of Desire and skip this sequel."
2,I found it too boring to continue after having read about 1/4 of it.,"While I was interested in the topic, it simply could not hold my interest. I didn't want to pick it up and read it."
5,Fascinating,"Te book contains an excellent and detailed examination of what Pollan calls ""our national eating disorder.""After reading this fascinating book, I doubt I will ever eat another Chicken McNugget or Twinkie."
5,"If you eat, then read this book","Easily one of the best books of 2006. Informative, fun, interesting, valuable. It will change the way you look at food - for the better - and may even make you live longer."
4,Interesting but a bit lengthy,"This book raises extremely interesting facts about the food that we eat in the USA. You will walk away concerned about what you eat as well as the collapse of the US farming community, and wonder what you can do to improve the dire straits we are in.Some of the sections were utterly fascinating, such as his tracing of food products through the industrial food complex.Other sections became too long and preachy. Descriptive, but sometimes more of a diary than a narrative, leaving less to be learned.It would be quite interesting to have a comparison of the situation in the US with the international community. Is this same disaster occurring in and exported to other parts of the world?"
4,Just when you thought it was safe to eat...,"This book is very enlightening and informative. Over the last several months I have been reading lots of books about health and nutrition. This book stands apart from other, not for the quantity of scientific data that it presents, but for the unique perspective it offers to readers. I've always wondered where the myriad ingredients on industrial foods comes from. This book gives you a glimpse of their origins and evolution. This is one of the only books I've ever read that makes you aware that eating can be a moral and political act. It certainly changes the way I think about food. I would have to say that I am much better informed about the consequences of my eating decisions because of this book. Anyone with an inquisitive mind should find some or all of this book to be very valuable."
4,"Gives you substantial ""food for thought""","This is a well-written, detailed book about the sources of various agricutural products and foods in the USA. The audiobook made it easier to get through some rather heavy and over-descriptive material. But that is the beauty of Pollan's style. I have certainly become more informed about mass (""industrial"") food production in the USA. Pollan has made me just a bit cynical about the ""organic"" foods avaialable on supermarket shelves.If only a few politicians would read (or listen to) this book, we may see some meaningful changes to the US farm subsidy programs!"
5,Please read this book.,Rarely does a book change the way I look at the world. This one has. I hope you choose to read this. We all need this information.
4,Excellent Quality!!,Get the variety pack right now!!Whatever these good people are doing it's wonderfull. The quality is off the charts and once you get over the flavor combinations you can get really creative and use it as a Spice to cook with. It's the BOMB!!
1,Righteous Blah,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. Higginbotham is not the feminist scholar she once was, and her writing needs more perspective. The book suggests that she's spent too long in the ivory tower. Too much post-modern psycho-babble in this volume."
4,I use this for my organic bakery,"I use only wholesome organic sugars for my organic bakery. they really make a difference. my only complaint is that the powdered sugar is clumpy and it takes a lot of extra mixing to get my glazes smooth. I think this is because its organic though, not the brand."
5,NonGMO Powdered Sugar,Tastes great and it's powdered sugar. What's to say about powdered sugar? When you are baking and desire powdered sugar having it be organic is ideal. Just say NO to GMO!!!
4,"Fit okay, doesn't leak.","It fit like it should, but the finish is a bit rough and uneven. I know that's typical, though, with most exhaust gasket donuts. It didn't crush, and doesn't leak."
2,Needs a map just to fold,Most of the road I looked for were there. Key difficult to decifer. A nightmare to fold. Too big with back side blank where more detailed city maps should have been.
1,Worthless,"Claims to hold 150ft of cable, it barely holds the 100ft cable I bought to go with it.There is no guide for the wire, so when winding it back in, you end up fighting the wire to keep it on the spool."
2,Much too small for 100' cord!,"The manufacturer's claim that this extension cord reel has the capacity to hold a 150 feet of cord is highly exaggerated. While it might work just fine for 150 feet of very light-weight extension cord, it's reel capacity is not adequate for even a 100 foot heavy-duty outdoor extension cord. I bought it to use with the Coleman 100 foot, 12 gauge/3 wire, low-temp outdoor extension cord. The Designers Edge reel was completely full by the time I had wound 80 feet of the cord onto it. I'm not happy with the product but I'm happy that Amazon makes it easy to return items that are unsatisfactory."
2,NOT worth the price!,"This product is a yeast, not a probiotic bacteria! Not sure if it does anything for you, despite the ads running on TV!!! I would stick with strains of probiotic bacteria for boosting the flora in your intestines!!!"
5,Finally a probiotic that helps me,"I was given a sample of florastor by a friend whose father is a doctor in Canada. I have celiac disease and uncomfortable digestive system symptoms. I've tried probiotics sold at my local store and I've tried all kinds of yogurts, but they didn't help me. I'm taking Florastor about once a week and I'm feeling significantly better."
4,pleased with results,"Purchased this product in order to restore healthy flora in digestive tract of a family member following a long course of antibiotics. They used this along with other beneficial bacteria probiotics and achieved the desired results. Also, I've been using this to boost the defenses of my immune system throughout the cold and flu season. I've not been ill once this winter. I'm pleased with the product and have been recommending it to others.-Registered Nurse"
2,GREAT PRODUCT DISHONEST RETAILER,"Item was listed as being in stock but it took them 8 days to fill the order and 4 to get to me. Either AmericaRX was lying about in-stock, or they could not care less about their customers.Do yourself a favor, pay the extra few cents and do not order from AmericaRX.I have ordered many things through Amazon without problems, AmericaRX is one that will not again get my business."
1,have not received it yet....,"I still haven't received my package yet...................Can you tell me the possible arrival date?I appreciate it.Sincerely,Donna L."
4,Florastor rocks,"I like the product. It's costly, but powerful, and my intestines (and GERD) are helped by it more than other products I've taken. It's supposed to be good for CDif, too, a horrible infection that elderly folks often get after surgery. But don't buy from American Wholesale if you live in Hawaii. I never received the package (they ship via UPS to Hawaii, then UPS supposedly takes it to the post office, who delivers it. That last part never happened after UPS delivered the package to Hawaii.) So I filed a claim, and was reimbursed. Luckily, I found out that Walgreens carries it (but it's more expensive there than on Amazon) so was finally able to get some. I actually bought it hoping my Mom who's in a nursing home and has CDif would take it ane benefit from it--so far that hasn't happened, but I hope it might next week after she gets the okay from her doctor to try it."
2,Did nothing for me,"I was excited about these possibly helping with some IBS issues I have, but unfortunately they had no noticeable effect. Too bad."
2,Didn't Work For Me,"After reading what several users had to say about this product, I ordered it with great anticipation. However, it only increased my intestine problems. It might be that my alergy to dairy products, not only lactose intolerant, was set off by the residual dairy in this product. So, my unscientific report is, if you are alergic to dairy this product may not work for you."
4,PRETTY GOOD,THE PRODUCT CAME FAST AND IN GOOD CONDITION. I DID NOT CHECK THE SONGS BEFORHAND AND I ASSUMED THAT ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS INCLUDED IN THE CD. OVERALL I THINK I DID A GOOD PURCHASE.
1,E-Machines Junk,"I loved my e-machine! Until 26 months later it died. An online search found that many others had the same problem: Power Supply FAILURE. I never had a problem with the computer till now. I thought it was wonderful. The problem is, when the cheap PS dies it also kills your motherboard and you are dead in the water. According to those who have tried to replace the MB, you can not just buy an MB and hope that does the trick. Microsoft sees the new MB as a new computer and the restore disk (that has all your operating software on it)which came with your emachine, will not work with the new board, so you have to spend another $100 or so for that. By the time you get it all you could probably have an HP that I am told is much more reliable...(?)Take heed to this WARNING. And those who already have an e-machine: spend $40 or $50 and replace that cheap ""Bestec"" PS before you have to spend hundreds on a new computer.learning the hard way,joyfulsongster"
1,Same experience as S Mueller - it died,"In less than three years a fault on the motherboard kept the PC from powering up. But in my case the power supply was ok. This is the second Emachine model I have owned with this problem. On the other one, the power supply died too."
1,Terrible Customer Service,I purchased the ant farm for my daughter and then tried to order ants. It has been nearly a month and they still have not arrived and their reason is because the temperature in my location is too extreme (ie. above 85 degrees). I live in Florida and it is June. It will be above 85 degrees every day for the next 100+ days. They should note that they prefer not to do business in warm weather states or during the damned summer. Most pathetic and obnoxiously arrogant customer lack-of-service ever!!!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would love to tell you about the ant farm and my experience, except one small thing.... THEY SENT ME DEAD ANTS and I returned them 2 months ago and now they refuse to answer anyone's phone calls and have not returned any emails either! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS..... If you do need ants, I purchased from Life Studies, LLC, they seem to be a lot more personable as far as making sure their customers are happy."
1,7 months waiting and dead ants,"I bought this item for my daughter as a birhtday gift. It said ""Allow 2-6 weeks for delivery."" I could not believe it took 7 months to ship ants. Also the manual said ""You'll receive 25 to 30 ----- ants."" My daughter received only 11 ants and 8 of 11 were already dead. Only 3 ants could not do anything. They died 2 weeks later and the green gel got moldy. This defective item made my daughter very upset. I wasted money."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this for my twins and thought this was going to be a great project. First off, they arrived with under 10 alive....the rest had died. I received it straight from the mail delivery truck as we were waiting anxiously, so they did not sit at all. Second, we followed all directions regarding transferring, and got them all set up. They never did dig the way they are supposed to, so this was very disappointing, and now we have all of them dead but one, and a heaping amount of mold in the container and I am not sure what to do with the last fellow. Very, very disappointing......we raised butterflies and it was a much more rewarding and educational project!"
4,Great Activity Book for all ages,"We recently made a trip out to the Grand Canyon, and I purchased this book for my three daughters (ages 7, 10, & 13) to keep them occupied while travelling. It did just that. All three girls thoroughly enjoyed the challenges and creativity of the puzzles. It was age-appropriate and informative for all three. Highly recommend this book."
3,AVERAGE TV MOVIE COMES TO DVD,"TO LOVE HONOR AND DECEIVE is one of those somber, serious-themed tv movies of the late 90s that offers competent performances wasted on a connect the dot script, that once again shows the underhandedness of our dear friends with the FBI.Vanessa Marcil gives a good performance as Sydnee, a devoted mother whose world is shattered when her husband and young son are killed in a boating accident. After their deaths, however, Sydnee finds out some disturbing news: hubby had an affair with her best friend (Rosalind Chao), and lo and behold, he was a smuggler, extortionist, and quite a few other things she never dreamed about. Thomas Gibson (Greg and Dharma) sleepwalks through his role; James Wilder plays the handsome detective who falls in love with Sydnee; and Leland Orser plays the asthma-plagued FBI agent with his own agenda.It isn't a bad movie, but it's slow pacing and excess padding keep it from being truly memorable."
2,Didn't last 1 year,"I never thought I would write an unpleasant review for a Sony product, Well, here it is.The speaker sound quality is excellent as well as being self contained for travel and charges the phone while in use. Purchased in Dec 2007 I would expect more than a year of product use.The adapter that the phone sits on will not connect with the phone. I thought it was my Z710i so I tried the W710i and it will not work either.I'm really disappointed since it made a great travel system to listen to music without having to take a laptop.I haven't thrown it out yet because I keep thinking the system will self-heal."
4,Good Product,"I got this product much cheaper than what it's advertising for now, so my review is probably based on the price ($30). For what I paid, it is an excellent product. I love being able to listen to my MP3's at work, at home, anywhere. Very simple to use."
5,gabbcore heaven,"This cd has such original flow goin. If you like music that changes alot and keeps it movin this one is rockin off the hook. If you dig that gabberhouse & hardcore than check it out listen to some real samples. If you liked ""Vitamin Gee"" and Omar Santana's ""Hardcore for the Headstrong"", than this one is definately worth a spin. Personally I think it tops those albums in a many of ways. so check it out, bring beats, and keep it bouncin. Peace/dj_flaco"
2,Boring,I am 13 and I read this book on my own time. I thought it wasn't really bad but it was really slow and really boring at some parts. The overall story is good. But it takes forever for them to tell you what the storyline is I would say that this is a good book if you want to hear a story about racism.
2,Falls apart after a year,"I have had this cover on my jeep continually day and night in Southern California for the last year now. It has seen little rain but lots of sunshine. The fit is very good and it is not hard to put on by myself. For the last year it has done its job well, but now the fabric is falling apart, especially where the sun hits it most. I have duct tape on many spots just to try and make it last a few more months. On the roof, I tried to brush some dirt off with my hand and I ripped a 10 inch spot. It has simply deteriorated due to the sun and outside elements. I would have been happy if it had lasted two years but it didn't. It is not made of a heavy material. It is pretty thin. It would be a good cover if you just needed it occasionally, but like I said before, mine has been on day and night and it lasted me a year...maybe a little longer with duct tape."
1,DO NOT BUY,I have had this cover for less then a year it is starting to tear.i only hope their return and replace policy is better then their product!
5,True Essence... DT Suzuki's hard work is worth the read.,"No fluff here, Straight to the point and concise. Though modern scholars say this was composed way later and not by the Author it is attributed to...that does not diminish it's supreme importance.A Great Bridge between Nagarjuna and Asanga.Mainly a treatise about the Sunyata and how the lower mind produces all that we see and experience, it, Like the Lankavatara, does not in my estimationequate with Yogacharya and Asanga's more complicatedbeliefs in the reality of the Conventional reality.Get your highlighter out. Though complex and complete, no preparatory study is needed in my opinion. Forget about Richards & Hakeda.This and the Dwight Goddard version are the best."
2,Watch out for this one...,"I'm sorry, but as a longtime Python fan, I have to tell people to avoid this CD like the plague. It has a few classic Python sketches, but do we really need to hear them AGAIN? And the new stuff... I have to say that it's sad. Python is already watered-down compared to most Brit comedy, but the new material in Spamalot is even more watered down. Even the great Tim Curry couldn't save this for me. I think that the people rating this at 5 stars are mostly people that will give anything connected to Python a high rating no matter what it is."
5,WONDERFUL,"I have definitely found my grail with this CD!! This show had me laughing from start to finish starting with a rousing chorus of FINLAND and ending with everyone getting married!! The singers are fabulous, especially Sara Ramirez who had such great numbers such as ""Find your grail"" and ""Whatever happened to my part"" Anyone who listens to this CD will listen to the show constantly nad find themselves singing along to ""His name is Lancelot"", the ""Song that goes like this"", and ""Act 2 Finale"" This is a great show and you should definitely buy it!!"
3,Wrong Item,I ordered it with the thought it was a DVD not a CD. My mistake. By the looks of things Spamalot is not in DVD format. Bummer!
4,Hilarious!,"This show is hilarious! Whether or not you like Monty Python, it is a great show. But, if you do like MP, this show will bring you back! Very fun and entertaining show!Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
3,Why Did It Win the Grammy?,"SPAMALOT to my suprise won 3 Tony Awards including Best Musical. But now, it won a Grammy for the soundtrack? I thought the show and the cd are both funny and that is what the score is. Every song is silly and goofy, I think the Award should of gone to a different show that had a serious score. But, if you were a Monty Python fan well, you will think different."
1,didn't work at all,"I'm sorry to say this didn't work at all for me. I tried it on multiple breeds of dogs, from within a few feet to 50 feet of range. Some dogs turned their heads but that could have easily been a coincidence. It did not produce the effect I wanted (the dogs to stop barking and run away).In addition, the battery compartment is almost too small for the battery. It took some effort to actually get the battery inside."
1,dog repeller,"unfortunately, this product does not work at all, not for my dogs anyway. it just seems to make my small pom-poo bark more. my other 3 dogs are really not quieted by it either. glad it works for some of you, because its a complete dud for us."
1,it does't work,"it doesn't work at all, I put new batteries and try with a lot of dogs, it's a fraud. Don't buy it."
2,Not for every dog,"worked about two times, now the dogs just ignore it.maybe works for others, item is not bad quality. Just didnt' work for my dogs."
2,It probably depends on the dog,"This product may work on some dogs, but it had no effect on our neighbors dogs when they bark and growl at us. It seemed to piss them off even more."
1,Had no effect whatsoever,"I had high hopes for this product, unfortunately, it did not live up to them. It was to try to get my yapping neighbor dogs to stop or at least surprise them a bit. They did not even notice the sound. I tried it on my dog, who is extremely sensitive to noise, barely even noticed it. Luckily it was not too expensive, but I would not waste the money on it if I had it to do over again. Oh well...."
1,Dog Repeller,"This product is basically useless. I ordered it to keep my neighbor's dog under control when I walk by. As it turns out, the range on this is on the order of inches instead of feet, which makes it just a really bad paper weight."
1,Did not do anything.,"Put new batteries in it. Pressed button, Light came on and nothing happened. Tried it on 4 different dogs from various ranges and none of them even flinched. Waste of time and money. Return was easy enough though."
1,Do not buy,"I though this was going to help me to stop my dog from barking so much , well it's not working . It's JUNK and it's not worth the money to send back. Do not buy ."
3,No more begging!,"I originally bought this to deter neighbor dogs from barking at me while walking my dogs. However, it doesn't seem effective outdoors beyond about 5 feet.I did find another use for it though... It's perfect if you have some little furry beggers bothering you when you're at the dinner table or having a snack on the couch!"
1,Dosent work!!!,"Dosent work, dont waste your money. 10 Dogs next door barking at us 24/7, this does not ""Repell"" anything. Maybe a mouse, but i doubt it. LOL"
1,Not useful on dogs,"One star because rating system does not allow zeroes.It freaks the cat out, works well to stop her from whining, but does nothing to barking dogs. I have experimented on numerous small dogs, with it right in their faces. Fresh battery. Barking increased.Do not rely on this as a defense! Battery case broke off in a 2-foot accidental drop and now I have to use a rubber band to keep the battery lid on.It's a cheap prank item. I'm now looking for an air siren, mostly for idiot dog owners who can't control their animals.."
3,Its Okay.,"I bought it to repell barking and aggressive dogs because i'm afraid of them and i'm constantly on places and streets where a dog is a must. It works on alittle more than half of the dogs, not at all. Sometimes you'll be amazed when a big or little dogs come running and barking against me and my friends and i put it directly and they stopped and go backwards. However, does not work on all dogs, but around a 60% it'll work and regarding to the price and its funtionallity its good. You can try. In fact im looking for another one and I'll really buy another one. Dont hesitate and try it. It is a helpfull tool if you're afraid of dogs."
2,JUNK,"I purchased this product hoping to reduce the barking from my 3 maltese when someone comes to the door. It worked well for that, however, it began going off even without me pushing the button. Even if it was just sitting in our kitchen drawer it would go off and my dogs would get upset and run away. I have no control over this device and I have to give it a poor recommendation."
1,hmmm NOPE,"tried going cheap, my landlady's dog dislike me and they simply slip away out of range of the repeller.I read this worked for others, but not in my case."
1,Total Bullshit!!!,So I have 6 pugs and they are extremely annoying and extremely loud and barking in unison. I bought this so I could get them to stop barking whenever someone walked by our house or whenever someone rang the doorbell or even when they are outside and the nextdoor neighbor lets her pitbull out and all hell breaks loose and our dogs start chasing each other back and forth up and down the fence line. It did nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing to my pugs and nothing to the stupid pitbull that won't stop barking at us through the fence. Its a big P.O.S.!!!!
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"Not a great item, looks like our tec people could do better with item so simple"
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this thinking it would get the dog's attention but that lasted about 5 minutes (and even then it was a small reaction). I could put the unit within 3 feet of our dog and it would not even cause her to turn her head much less create some diversion to attract her attention. It does seem to work with my daughter's dog (a pug) but not our dog (a Shiba Inu). I do know for a fact that she has great hearing since she always seems to know when a car pulls up into our driveway. So I guess, it may depend on the type of dog that you have as to whether this device will work. By the way, I gave it to my daughter and it seems to work for her."
2,pet parade dog repeller review,"I don't know why they call this item a dog repeller, my dog comes when I push it sometimes. It will get her attention as long as she is not really interested in something else. I had purchased it hoping to repell dogs that are off leash that would come up to us when we are out walking, since my dog growls and wants to start a fight with with these dogs. Since I don't know if it will attract or repell these same dogs I haven't tried it in this situation. Hope this review helps.J.P."
1,ineffective,"5 small dogs in yard behind my home go on barking sprees at all hours, lasting long periods. The device only served to stimulate some of them into more barking. A waste of money. Would have been great IF it had worked."
1,Total Crap!!,"Do not waste your money.........was 5 feet from several dogs and they just turned their heads to look at me. No running, barking, or even trying to avoid me.......this thing is garbage."
2,Works 50% of time,I have 3 dogs. It only works with 2 of them. One of my dogs tottaly ignores the sound. The range is a problem too. Too short.
3,Doggie roulette,"This product works as specified and is reasonably priced.It might be good for training a specific dog, but it certainly does NOT repel ALL dogs.e.g. it repelled a rat terrier, but not a mixed breed or Belgian Sheepdog ( who just cocked her head!)"
1,Did not work for me,"Our neighbor has 2 chocolate labs who bark at anything that moves, including us. They can see us just barely through the fence. I tried this looking at other reviews. What did I get? Less money in my bank account. Simply put...it did not work. They did not even flinch. In fact, I could have swore they barked MORE! All I know is that in my case it did not work. Note to everyone that has cats...DO NOT test this inside. They REALLY do not like it. Maybe this should be called a cat repellant?"
3,Dog Trainer-Bark Stopper,This product works but you need to be close to the dog. We use ours for barking control.
1,What A Joke!!...,"I bought this to help train our new Papillon puppy. He just looked at it with curiosity than started licking it as though he enjoyed it. Same response Every time. The only pets this thing sent running or disturbed was our cats. If I could return this THING I Would! I'm Not Happy With This Purchase, and I surely wouldn't recommend it. Serious waste of money for what I was needing it for, and now it's heading for the recycling bin.I purchased it because of the Positive Reviews and Cost. Hindsight...I should've went with my first choice, even though it was more expensive. Choose Wisely...Because I Surely Didn't."
1,Does not work...,"My dog put his ears up the first time i used it and stopped, after that he just ignored it likes its not even their. Waste of money"
1,Worthless,"This item was purcheased for the purpose of seeing if it did what it says it does, it does not. I am a Military Working Dog Trainer and we used this item on 20 K-9s ranging from Sheps, Mals, Labs and mixed breeds. The K-9s ranged from high drive to low drive and no drive at all. Everytime it was used not one dog was effected by it. Do not waste your money."
2,Did not work,Okay I was having problems with my Black Lab barking at random times. I tried this and for the first few days it worked somewhat. But then after a few days he got used to it and just continued to bark. I even tried this on the neighbor dog within a reasonable distance and it didn't work for that dog. Waste of money.
1,No deal.... ALL DUD!,"I read the good reviews and thought that this would be a great investment. NOT!!!!!!!!! I bought this device for my black lab puppy who had become a nuisance barker. My mother has shih-tzus and it worked on those dogs. When I tried it on my lab he just kept barking, and barking and barking. It didn't even phase him. The worst part is that it only lasted for a day and a half. Now it doesnt even work. Completely broken!!! I wasted 13.00 dollars on this device only for it to be of no help what so ever. I am lucky that I didn't purchase it to protect myself from big dogs. It would have left me defenseless. I do not recommend this device to anyone. I am going to buy a bark collar instead. Pay the money and spring for something a little more expensive. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,DIDNT WORK,My dogs tried to attack me when i pressed the button and at times get angry and bark or just sit and moan.
1,does not work,"I got this hoping it would stop our dogs from barking whenever someone would come to the door, but unfortunately it dont work at all."
4,Amazing Comfort but Not Durable,"This is an amazingly comfortable pad. I really have trouble when I don't have it with me. However, after 6 months of use the cloth covering the gel part started to come off."
1,Cheaply Made,"I have used this product for less than two month. I have owned it for about three months but say less than two months because I do not sit at my PC every day as would an Adm. Assistant. The seam has failed and the stuffing is squeezing out. The wave design IMHO is just an excuse to skimp on materials, and cheap materials at that! I've had other products which lasted two years before the seal holding the stuffing failed. The stuffing consists of a thin rectangle of foam surrounded by a softer dense foam which feels like semi-dried latex chalking. Better products have a solid core of silicon jel which cushions the wrist while retaining it's shape for years. I may as well just be using the neoprene backing at this point."
1,Terrible Wrist Rest Pad,The wrist pad I brought a couple of months ago had a terrible smell when I purchased it and the smell is still there but not as strong. Now the gel is coming out at the seams. I cannot use the wrist rest and I tried to fix it but it cannot be fixed. I would not recommend this item.
1,Belkin Wrist Pad,"Pad was comfortable and worked well; however, was made in China and had an odor that bothered my sinus. Had to return item for a refund."
4,The fabric cover comes loose,"This is a nice product, and I'm glad to have it, but the fabric cover of the wrist pad came loose. It's still glued down in most places, but it sometimes wrinkles up weird due to not being pulled taut everywhere."
4,Good Review,"This product totally meet my expectatives! it was well shipped and packed, and came in perfect conditions, and it has the right description and size."
1,Belkin wrist rest--do NOT buy!!,"In a word, the Belkin wrist rest SUCKS!! It is as hard as the petrified one I got rid of, it is narrow and it is half as deep as the one I had before. Also, it has some kind of depression in it on the left hand end, so whatever gel is in it doesn't help at all there. Since there were no other selections available for gel wrist rests, I could not ""divine"" all of this from pic and product description. A bargain NOT!! I am looking for a replacement, NOT where I got this one, fer shur. And, I am highly disappointed in this offering from Amazon--this was my first foray into purchasing non book items from Amazon. And oh--ergonimic??--NO WAY!!"
2,Not particularly useful,"I bought this book from another source at a ""fire sale,"" which should have tipped me off to the relative value of the book. Previously I had purchased Jim Ainsworth's ""How To Become A Successful Financial Consultant,"" which is an outstanding book, and I was hoping for more of the same from Rattiner. I can only say that the Rattiner book is useful primarily in that it makes me appreciate the quality of the Ainsworth book even more."
2,Priceless for the completely clueless,Half of the information in this book could be applied to anybody looking to start a small business. The other half is a rather general explanation of the processes that financial planners need to serve their clients. A few examples of documentation used by financial planners such as client questionnaires may interest newbies. One would be better off getting a book devoted to financial planning of which there are few of any quality and a book devoted to guiding aspiring small business owners. I just don't see how anyone could read this book and be any closer to being a competent financial planner.
4,His heart is in the right place...,"A real book, not a pie-in-the-sky, full of theory book. Written by a author who's heart is in the right place. Many people from many different industries are pouring into the financial planning industry. This book provides them with practical, step-by-step, approaches needed to dig in and get started.Mr. Rattiner gives the reader a solid framework on which to build. He outlines the key points, something very needed, if someone is new to the industry. An excellent reminder to those of us in the business.Excellent summaries, charts, checklists and samples are sprinkled throught the book.My favorite chapter was ""Marketing Your Practice"" and the sample SWOT Analysis.In total, if you are looking for a ""Nuts & Bolts"" book and wish to get started in the process of becoming a financial Planner, this book is for you."
4,A Good Book for Beginners,"This is a nice book for beginners because Eileen Westfall gives directions for a number of different blocks and incorporates them into wallhanging size quilts. She also includes directions for making a pillow or tote bag from quilt blocks. Her piecing and project assembly directions are complete and easy to follow. I especially liked her ""Tumbling Baskets"" Wallhanging made from three basket blocks made in pleasing shades of pink and green.There are also introductory sections on quiltmaking and quilt finishing that are geared toward the beginning quilter. She does an excellent job of explaining techniques in a simple manner. As the Quilting Host at BellaOnline.com, I feel that this is an excellent book for beginners."
3,Product Great -- Vendor Experience not so great,"I was delighted to find these refills for Clorox BathWand available through Amazon.com -- even though it was through an external vendor. The refills are no longer available in my local stores but I still like the BathWand and want to continue using it. As usual, the delivery was perfect and the refills are exactly what I was looking for. So, initially, I gave a rating of 5 out of 5 stars for this purchase. However, shortly after this order, I received a copy of Field and Stream magazine in the mail. I had not subscribed to it and starting investigating how this magazine subscription was started. Several phone calls through various vendors led back to the Polstein's Home and Beyond customer service -- where they had automatically subscribed as a service to their customers. The subscription, supposedly, has now been canceled and they have apologized for the frustration and inconvenience."
1,Travel Mug,"This Trudeau Boardroom 16 ounce travel mug I purchased to support Breast Cancer Awareness in pink. Totally unhappy with this mug, it leaked and even after the mug was empty coffee came from somewhere and filled the interior. A complete waste of a purchase. Do not buy you will just have to return"
2,Poor stiching and cheap,I was so disappointed in this mug that I gave it to my kids to use. I expected better quality for such a high price!
2,This is more like remedial English,"I don't consider myself a particularly good writer, and I know for a fact that I couldn't market ice water in a desert, so I would never presume to know more about PR than someone who does it professionally. Nevertheless, everything in this book falls under what I would tend to refer to as ""common sense"" and/or ""not worth paying for."" If you graduated from an American high school and do not know the difference between ""there,"" ""they're"" and ""their,"" then you need a lot more help than any single book can give. Nevertheless, that's the sort of remedial composition this title is dedicated to. I suppose the example press releases are useful, but you can find thousands of those free of charge on the internet."
2,I agree with Simon about this guy,"Weird Al did a parody of Hicks' song Do I Make You Proud, and after listening to Hicks sing it and Al sing it, I honestly have to say that Weird Al has a much better voice. Enough said."
5,Worth Every Penny/Great CD,"This is a great Buy. I really enjoyed listening to it and would recommend it.[...]I hope you will listen for yourself. Taylor is a true star. I love Do I Make You Proud. Yes, I admit I am a Taylor Fan. He still has a great voice, he sings it with Soul. If you buy this CD you won't be disappointed."
4,"Taylor is a good singer, but he still needs work","Based on these two tracks, I think Taylor will have a bright future. The track Do I Make You Proud is dedicated to the fans who supported him and voted him as the American Idol. This song also applies to anyone who has achieved their goals in life. I loved this track. Taking It to The Streets is a classic song about a person who doesn't give up hope despite living on the street. Taylor sings this song with a lot of energy and effort. It is not as smooth vocally as Do I Make You Proud, but it is an unique version that some people will enjoy. I predict Taylor will be successful if he continues to perform songs that have a personal meaning to him like Do I Make You Proud."
5,YES Keep at it Taylor,"Taylor exhibits the kind of form you rarley see in an artist, he definatley knows what he is looking for,and how to use his voice. If you watch closley he is so into the music, he makes you feel it, it is an impact you dont forget. He is truley a rising star & we are buying. I hope someday we hear him sing the blues, as I believe he has the ability to sell millions. Thank you Taylor, we are on your patrol buddy, keep pushin......."
5,Soul Patroler!,"I am proud to be a soul patroler for the simple fact that this young artist is truly amazing. I have played this short cd over and over and ""Do I Make You Proud"" still brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. On the flip side I enjoyed the second song ""Takin It To the Streets"" much better because I thought it highlighted his voice much clearer and that's his genre by far! Although I like ballads very much and they move me emotionally, I prefer Taylor singing those wild, upbeat, fun songs that make you groove! Can't wait to hear his entire collection of songs and I hope he sticks with those upbeat songs as well. Go Taylor!"
2,Disappointed more than enjoyed,"Sorry to say but Taylor's single is not great. I think the biggest problem is with the song choices. I like Taylor and I think he deserves to be the Idol, but NO to his single.Hopefully his album would be better, with great song choices"
1,Disappointing,"Hopefully his album will be better...""Do I Make You Proud"" is utterly dull. American Idol needs to find better singles for their finalists."
5,DIMYP,"I think this song is going to be a classic - sung at graduations, ceremonies, weddings. What a terrific voice this guy has - he is going to be a huge star."
3,So-so,"I watched this months ago and I was *supposed* to write a review but I forgot. Just goes to show how much I liked this movie. The hero was definitely manly and hunky and the heroine was gorgeous. Wish I had her looks! Otherwise, I just found the movie a bit bland despite the wonderful locations. I dont know.. I thought the hero seemed a bit weak despite his hunky persona. *** Spoilers *** I mean why in the heck did he to sell all that he had or I guess his business and move to where the girl is?? So he's gonna live there now?Also I didn't feel the chemistry between them. Sure the mystery and the action was sort of good but I didn't really see much character development. I actually was a bit bored by it."
3,NOT Mac compatible,"Despite the description, this item is absolutely not Mac compatible. According to APC, ""Mac uses 24V DC our travel power case has a maximum voltage of 20V DC.""Just make sure you know what you're buying, only specifically listed laptops are supported."
3,Battery life and phone book support not so great - sleek,"This phone is sleek and has nice features. While the Sprint store was able to print my phone book from my old Verizon samsung phone, they could not download my phonebook into the new phone. It has also been a hassle getting it to work as a cell phone modem. With my samsung Verizon phone I just bought the cable and CD and it worked (although Verizon told me it wouldn't). This phone handles pictures nicely, but I would much prefer it handle my address book nicely and my internet conenction needs. I was able to transfer files using bluetooth, but just pictures, not vcards."
5,14 KARAT GORD,"This is one of Lightfoot's finest works, period. The lyrics, voice, orchestration, and production all fall into place to create one tremendoucs work.The opening track 14 KARAT GOLD grips you instantly with it's tasty bass and soft studio accents. The next track holds you with the perfect balance of studio engineered sound and a clear acoustic guitar.I could go on in detail for each track on this album, but I'll keep it short and sweet by saying this; this is Lightfoots best vocal output of all his albums. The voice is deep, strong, warm, and conveys the depth of how much he felt love, beauty, pain and loss."
3,Ukulele,"For starters, I bought this for my dad as a kind of half joking/half serious birthday gift as he has said, ""I think I'm a Ukulele-playing kind of guy."" It was a nice color and cute, but for the most part looks like it was put together by someone with a ""make your own Ukulele"" kit...you can see the glue on the inside and there is hand painting (and not very neat at that) on the fret board. Also, I thought it would be coming with some kind of cover or bag for travel and storage, but it did not come with anything else.I guess all in all it served its purpose and it was fun to open and play around with, but I was disappointed as it didn't look like the real thing. Bottomline: if you want something just for fun, to learn or for kids to play with, this would work well; but if you're looking for something more professional and/or sturdy and high quality, take a look at other options."
1,Store cancelled my order with no explanation,"I ordered this ukulele for my husband as a Christmas gift.I order with time in advance so it could arrive in time; however, the store cancelled my order without any explanation.I placed the order once again - hoping this time it would go through - and, voila, the store once more CANCELS my order WITHOUT any explanation, apologies or what not!Very upsetting."
5,Great remake,I heard this remake of the Hank Williams Jr. classic on the radio and just had to buy it. It has a lot of emphasis on Y2K and is quite funny as well. I would say it is a must buy for Country Music fans everywhere.
4,Great fun !,"My 6-yr-old grandson got this as a gift - what fun he's having ! Reception is good, came with batteries installed for ""out-of-the-box"" operation. Seem pretty sturdy, good choice !"
1,The picture is wrong.,"Be careful, ladies and gentlemen, this is not...I repeat NOT a toslink to mini-toslink cable, as the picture would lead you to believe. The ILS1002M cable is regular toslink on both ends. The description is correct, however, the picture is wrong."
3,Great Cable!,"This cable is worth every penny. The connector is beautiful. The ""M"" in Monster is wonderfully printed and the finger grips feel like work of art. Other than the connector, I don't have much to say about this cable compared to other Toslink cables. The innards are really all the same. I can say that there is a marked improvement over the extended coathanger I had been using previously to connect my receiver to my audio equipment."
4,"Quality product - easy to print, easy to peel off page","These are quality labels. Easy to print and mine did not smudge - when used with both a laser printer and also a deskjet printer. They are the right size to use on either a legal or short envelope 1x 2 1/2 inches.Look on the Avery site for templates if your word processing application does not have this label size templated.the labels COULD be a little larger to be more readable on an envelope....hence the four stars. However, these do the job and you get more per package."
5,What A Voice!,"Eve Gallagher's 1995 release ""Woman Can Have It"" remains one of my personal favorite dance albums of all time. Throaty, deep & husky vocals, strong songwriting (courtesy of mentor Boy George), & crisp production from the likes of Evolution & Ramp. Standout tracks: ""Heaven Has to Wait"", ""You Can Have it All"", ""Crimes of the Heart"", ""Last Night"" & a rousing, acapella rendition of ""Amazing Grace"".Sadly, this masterpiece remains Eve's only album to date. A true mid-90s house classic."
1,Sherlock Holmes,My wife and I watched this movie and we really didn't care for. I don't know why Hollywood has to remake movie's and totally change the charcater and story . I guess this movie would appeal to some but it didn't appeal to us.
1,Rental Copy!,"Im upset that this is a rental copy, but not only that i didnt get any special features/ extra discs or anything because it was just a rental copy. This was not made clear at all among purchase!"
5,Sherlock Holmes Movie,"I love the movie. very entertaining, lots of action and comedy as well. Both of these actors are great and work together so good. The sets, backgrounds are so genuine to the time period."
2,lame,"no real mystery, just nonesence and drama and jokes. I was dissapointed. I have read many good mystery novels and could have named plenty story lines more worthwhile."
4,The visual tone of the film is great,I really enjoyed the style and tone of this film. I think the actors did a great job. I found this film to be not as appealing for women. More of a guy movie. I also wasn't thrilled with the magical aspect of the plot. Was hoping for a more realistic story line.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath
4,Sherlock Holmes,"Good Movie, kind of different than I thought or was use to with this character. But still good.. well worth watching again."
4,the movie was just the same as when i saw it in the theatre,"I got my movie on time and its a dark movie with the same old downey charm jude law could of done better its a fun who done it type of movie I mostly like looking at downey jr thats why i bought it,,,,,"
1,A fine example of why we can't have nice things...,"Whether it's a major block buster film, a comical television show, or a re-imagining of a classic series of stories it seems that we Americans can't match our British counterparts when it comes to original entertainment. This film, while entertaining, doesn't capture the feel or intrigue of a ""Sherlock Holmes"" story; perhaps if it were released 15 years ago, before all the ""twists"" and ""shocking reveals"" were commonplace on basic cable. I believe this film, and its sequel, could have done just as well (maybe better) if they weren't trying to jump on the Holmes ""mythos.""If you're a fan of the intrigue and mystery that's the basis of a good Sherlock story, of the ""I didn't see that coming"" and the ""How did they pull that off?"" then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you avoid this film and instead turn your attention to the ""Sherlock"" series produced by the BBC; you know, the company that's based in the traditional home of Sherlock Holmes.Sherlock: Season One"
4,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Hlmes - the movieIt came in good shpe and in a timely manor. I would buy from them again.
2,disapointed,"love the actual movie but the disapointment was in the digital copy, part of the reason of buying this set was that it came with a downloadable digital copy. needless to say when i recieved it the digital copy had expired, i don't know who i'm more disapointed in Amazon for selling it or WB for limiting the download time."
3,Great action but never a fan of black magic,"I love Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, but I expected a little more from the movie. The action was great and it was refreshing to see these literary characters in a new light. But of all the potential scripts to choose from to debut the characters after all this time, why such a dark plot revolving around black magic? And it all was explained so quickly at the end. Just a little disappointed."
5,Great movie,"I love this film, a great first in the Sherlock Holmes series starring two very wonderful actors! I completely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the books!"
4,SHERLOCK HOLMES,This is a good and entertaining movie and worth watching but he is not SHERLOCK HOLMES. I have not received the DVD yet bit will enjoy adding to my collection.
5,AWESOME!!!!,This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! It is a movie for the whole family to enjoy!!!!
1,Pure Garbage,"I've been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, both in book form and on film, my entire life. The films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce didn't require special effects and blaring noise to hold their audience's interest.Having read every book and seen every movie involving Holmes, I don't recall much in the way of gunplay or any other form of violence. The essence of Holmes was his brain....not his brawn, but you would never know if from this trash.This piece of garbage may appeal to people who know nothing of the original stories and therefore might enjoy the overblown antics in which Holmes and Watson are involved. Frankly, this is one of the few movies I've ever paid admission to and walked out on. I do not own the DVD and would not accept it if it were given to me for free.Obviously, a large profit was made on this film as there is a sequel to be released shortly. I now know enough not to waste my time and money on that one."
1,Tedious and cartoonish,"What a tedious movie - no plot, no character development, no drama, no entertainment. Just endless and unpleasant cartoonish violence, it seems to have been designed to appeal to 12 year old boys. The jumpy direction only added insult to injury. Despite the potential of the cast, a total waste of time and effort."
4,Good value,Received in less than time quoted. First time buyer of used DVD. Arrived in good shape as advertised. Good value for the money. Would buy from this seller again.
3,Cheap Quality,The quality of the cd was just ok. Almost like it had been duplicated too many times as the picture was a bit grainy.
4,sherlock homes,well downy does a good job of being sherlock and the special effects for the scenery does a great job of actually making you feel your there way back hundred years ago in england.
2,Sherlock Holmes as superhero and not just a detective of genius,"As much as I admire Downey as a uniquely talented actor, this film simply did not work for me. Not only is SH made into a boxer and street fighter, but he is something of a rebel rake. This goes against my memories of him as an austere Victorian who survived and thrived by his wits more than his fists. Also, perhaps I am getting old, but I have absolutely no recollection of what the caper was, which is a sure sign (to me) that it failed to engage me in the slightest.Not recommended."
1,Unable to bypass previews 15 minutes.,"This dvd will not let you bypass the 15 minute previews. Each time I want to watch this, it forces me to play the previews all the way through. Left my taste for the movie very sour."
1,Boring,"I was asked to see this movie with some friends and I thought it looked decent, but after the first 20 minutes I just couldn't wait til it was over. It's very overrated and I guess just not my taste."
1,Sorry Sherlock,"This movie was like watching an unorganized fire drill! Disconnected, chaotic and boring in spots. The music was awful..glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.I had been looking forward to seeing it, now I don't know why."
1,load of crap,"typical modernist junk that lacks taste and class - this is not Holmes, and it's not good at all by any stretch. Aren't there ANY good filmmakers around? Why would anyone need CGI to make a Sherlock Holmes film? Terrible load of crap."
1,We are forced to watch three trailers? No thanks,"When you insert the disc, you are forced to watch three trailers. I hit every button on my remote to skip them, but after reading the many other complaints on here I took the disc out and returned it to Blockbuster without watching.Do no buy, or watch as you are giving in to the movie industry."
5,Bridget's Review,My husband and I both thought this was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were meant for these roles. The plot was fantastic and the movie was hilarious. There was no boring pause in it like you find in some movies. I would recommend this DVD to everyone.
3,Good Movie but BAD DVD,I enjoyed the film but purchased the regular DVD version. There are basically no bonus features. No commentary and nothing that the Blu-Ray version offers. Why not? Are they trying to drive the DVD market toward all Blu-Ray? I was very disappointed in this purchase.
4,Good movie,Good movie with more humor than I expected. The movie definitely kept our interest. I would also like to watch the rest of the series.
3,Not my favorite,"Kinda goofy take on Sherlock- I don't expect the new one to be any better- Just my opinion-not the sellers fault, it was delivered quickly in perfect condition."
1,Crap!,This film is rubbish! Conan-Doyle is probably spinning fast enough in his grave to power the whole world for the next thousand years!
2,Sherlock Holmes Poser,"This movie has nothing to do with Conan Doyle's character of Sherlock Holmes. Despite highjacking character names and ""The Lady in Red"" this Holmes nothing in common with the traditional Holmes character. Gone are Holmes' analytical strengths and deductive reasoning to be replaced with violence and movie effects. If you want authentic Sherlock Holmes, leave this in the trash bin and check out the BBC series with Jeremy Brett, a genius who truly understood the complexity and brilliance of the Holmes character. You will undoubtably see what a pathetic imitation this movie represents."
4,A Sherlock Holmes for the new century,"I had some fears about Robert Downey playing the great Sherlock Holmes--but they were quickly dispelled during the film's exciting opening. Downey's Holmes if far more active then Basil Rathbone--but still fits comfortably into the Arthur Conan Doyle mold. Doyle's Holmes was a boxer, stick fighter, and master of an obscure Asian Martial Art--so is Downey's, and if his lack of hygiene and occasional sloppiness can be ignored, his version of the master Detective is more or less on model.The special effects in this one are first rate and the supporting cast, particularly Jude Law, is exceptional.A nice film--and I look forward to the sequel which shall inevitably come our way."
5,Not bad,"This was a pretty good movie, Robert Downey makes an excellent Sherlock Holmes, and the story (though not from an original stories) is an interesting direction for Holmes, while maintaining the spirit of the original novels. All in all, great movie!Do you think they could do a modern remake of Hound of the Baskervilles?"
5,Great Movie!,I bought this for my husband. He loved the movie and has watched it 2 or 3 times. Would recommend it to anyone that likes this type of movies.
4,Good rating for this show.,I had seen this movie at the cinema and like it. Therefore I bought it. I would deinitely recommend this product. -- GREG
3,"A ""Reboot"" of the Classic","Essentially a soft steampunk ""reboot"" of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories, ""Sherlock Holmes"" depicts the title character as a restless, obsessive mind in need of constant stimulation. Watson isn't as much the fool as he's been in previous cinematic incarnations, and the two know how to dish out combat and thrills 90's-style.The movie is packed with juicy production design and writing - it might be worth a second viewing if you can get past squirming through unabashed depictions of demonic worship (despite whatever rationality you possess). Is Guy Ritchie throwing out rebellion against his former lover's (Madonna) embrace of Kaballah?"
3,Sherlock Holmes as an early James Bond?,Good as a flick taken on it's own but not in the real spirit of the original Arthur Conan Doyle character. Robert Downey is a good actor but puts a bit too much mania into Holmes. Dr. Watson is much more a participant in this version of the Sherlock Holmes saga.
3,Well-acted...but,"Kelly Reilly absolutely SHINES as Dr. Watson's love interest. Who is she?! And where can we see more of her? Ms. Reilly would have been a better Irena Adler than Rachel McAdams. Ms. McAdams did not have the gravitas for the role, while Kelly Reilly could have pulled off the sophistication and subtlety of Conan Doyle's most famous female character. Jude Law was engaging and believable as Watson. Robert Downey Jr. was okay as Holmes, though not the best acting performance in the film,,,,too silly and dopey IMHO. The worst thing about the film and why I gave it only three stars was the ridiculous plot and jumpy all-over-the-place direction."
2,Is craptastic a word?,"These tiny magnets are in no way good. They barely hold up one plain sheet of paper when you hang them, and god forbid if you drop one. If you do drop it, let it go, you won't find it again. If you need to use it to hold up something thicker than a regular sheet of printer paper, don't bother trying. I could not be less satisfied with this product."
5,Powder Me Pretty,I got this to layer with the oil version. This spray has a powder-y finish that feels good and the fragrance is the perfect compliment to the oil. There is no hint of alcohol or any diminishing of scent that trails off to a chemical headache-producing pungency of most concoctions on the market. I wish more women wore this.
5,a classy gift,I gave this as a gift. It is exactly what I was looking for and is a nice quality gift for the money.
3,damaged dvd,The item was scratched upon arrival and fell out during shipping.Item fell out of its hub
5,Browning,"Robert Browning's poetyr is more difficult than his contmeporaries, arnold and tennyson (the lower-cases are intentional) and much better. Reading ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came"" makes one wonder why Kafka was so uplifting, yet the same poet also writes such charming verse for shildren as ""The Pied Piper of Hamlin"". A marvelous book!"
4,Avery - always dependable,"I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well, but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer, the print is legible and clean, and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy, and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers, and these labels stick like a charm."
1,"Junk, laser ink rubs off easily","I've used these labels in Clear for years, and ink from my B&W laser printer stuck to them like glue. But these paper labels can't seem to hang on to it. By the time I press the label down to the envelope, there are smudge marks everywhere."
5,Avery Labels -- great product,"These labels are much cheaper buying through Amazon. They're Avery labels, great product. You can't go wrong by purchasing them. And, I will be buying more when I run out."
5,Great!,Love these I've been busy shipping many things so these are so wonderful to use. I've also used them in my address book--updated everyone's info and it looks so nice typed and on these great labels.
4,Better than many but still not the best.,"This is certainly a nice collection of fun Spanish children's songs, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I had ""Diez Deditos"" first and loved that one so much that I was anxious to find more of the same. However, this recording is just not as good a production and seems a little flat in comparison. If you don't have ""Diez Deditos"" you may be perfectly happy, but you'd be missing out on something better!"
1,ROLLED THE DICE.......SNAKE EYES,"WELL NO LUCK FOR ME WITH THIS PRODUCT. I ASSEMBLE MY OWN COMPUTERS, SET THIS DEVICE CORRECTLY, THE COMPUTER RECOGNIZES THE DRIVE AND INSTALLS THE OS BUT THEN THE MBR IS CORRUPTED. MY GUESS IS THIS DEVICE MAY WORK BETTER FOR SECONDARY DRIVES THAT DO NOT CONTAIN THE OPERATING SYSTEM."
1,Do not ever buy this product,"Destroy my 500GB hard disk. Cannot recognize a few 250GB hard disks. For the hard disk that it can recognize, the transfer rate is very slow. The Amazon picture is different from what I received. The one I received is made in China. I bought from [...] the same Sabrent SBT-STDB in 2006 which has the same picture as on Amazon and it is made in Taiwan. It works like a charm with all my 250GB, 500GB and 1TB SATA hard disk. I order it despite others' negative comments because I see the same picture as the one I have and have good experience with it. But I received a different product which is made in China and which not only does not work but destroyed my hard disk with all its data. Highly recommend not buying this product."
4,Fatima Today,"I ordered this product for the express purpose of viewing The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima.This historical event was very well portrayed. In viewing this movie, I wondered why the last six or seven popes haven't consecrated Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, The movie was well documented. I believe this film should be on the big screen alongside The Passion of Christ"
5,Great Collection,This is a great collection to have. It is very inspiring and wonderful movies to share with your family. These classics feature some of my favorite actors and actresses.
5,better understanding of history,Oriental Heritage by william durant gives the reader an understanding of non-western history. It shows how these cultures ifluenced western culture and what they accomplished. The book is interesting because of the level of information about different groups like egyptians. It provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in history.
4,Great poetry to read with a friend!,I like this book because it's a fun way to learn about insects. You can also read it with a friend. My favorite part about the book was the poem called Water Boatman. It's m favorite because it was very funny. I also liked the one called Honeybees because you got to use two different personalities. The queen bee had a wonderful life and the worker bee has a hard life and hates being a bee. I would recommend this book to my teachers as a learning book about poetry and insects.
3,Don't Read Alone,"Don't pick this book of poetry up unless you are with someone else who wants to read it too. This book is meant to be read aloud by two people at the same time, if you try reading it silently it gets very boring. If you are into performance and like to practice reading things aloud, then this book is great. As a future school teacher I have seen a lot of possibilities come from this book. Some struggling reader could be motivated to practice quite a bit by this book if they have a partner to read with (parent, classmate, friend, etc.), but it is not at all entertaining to read in any other way than with ""two voices."""
2,Could not use product,"The part received was as described, remanufactured brake calipers. It would be important to know which parts of the product are delicate and required special handling. When installing the product, a number of the bolts were too tight. In particular, when we hand fixed the caliper and it was time to perform the breathing, the breather bolt was too tight and got broken. We thought of drilling it out to use the one from the old caliper and this did not work out either. Now I have to do a new order from a different seller, because I am sure the seller wouldn't accept this back. I hate this experience because, it did not save me the money nor the time as I thought it would. I must mention i have had other products through amazon.com which have worked great, this is perhaps just one time experience."
5,Tim O'brien at his creative best,"This album was released around the same time as Cornbread Nation, another one of Tim's masterpieces. This one really has a bluegrassy/Irish/Celtic flavor that is timeless. A must-have."
3,Pretty Good But Nickel Is Not Good Coating,"This is a pretty good horn for beginners, but i would not suggest this to an intermediate or advanced trumpeteer. I used a little, but now its at my old school being used by 5th graders."
1,"""Was he on something while recording this album?""",Shawn Mullins sounds like hes stoned and half asleep while singing his songs on this album. His lyics are just like all the others that are heard from various artists and I wish he would atleast sound as if hes alive while hes singing.
4,The Best Product on the market,The Monster Cable J2 CD1-3 High-Performance Audio Interconnect Shows high performance and is a really great product that is that expensive.I suggest everyone that has just bought a c.d player buy one of these cords!
3,Bought them at a great low price.,"I've ordered another style of Easy Spirit walking shoes and loved those as they fit great and need no breaking in period.... I love it when I can wear a shoe straight out of the box with no problems.This time around I decided to give the Easy Spirit Jumper style a try due the deep discounted price and good reviews. The Easy Spirit Jumper walking shoes took time to break in and were tight feeling across the top of my feet at first. I have a high arch, so this may have been why I experienced the tightness when I fist began wearing them.Also, the Easy Spirit Jumper looks a bit fuddy-duddy and not very stylish looking, but for the price I decided to keep them."
2,Decline of Easy Spirit Quality,"I used to be a big Easy Spirit fan, until I bought Easy Spirit's Jumper and Punter recently.First, the good: toe box wide enough for my wide feet.Now, the ugly: there is simple no shock absorbency. My heels hurt like hell, and the pain persists for hours after I've removed the shoes. This issue only occurred after I began wearing these new Easy Spirit shoes (it's been less than two months). I have not had any food/spinal injury.In addition, the outsole material is very cheap and the outsole began chipping within one week of use.As I read the product description, I find that the shock absorbent material type is not mentioned. Is it simply EVA or something else cheaper? Who knows?"
2,Not for me,"In person the boots looked like the picture, but the leather seemed low quality considering the price. It was like stiff cowhide, and when I tried on weren't comfy at all. Not enough padding in the boot I think."
5,Broad-spectrum rock & roll at its best.,"moe. is an extremely talented and versatile band. Their music brings together many influences yet they are forging a distinctive sound. The way they go about their business is reminiscent of The Grateful Dead as they allow tapers at their shows and free trading of their music. Listening to moe. one is reminded of great classic rock from Pink Floyd to Steely Dan as well as groups like (early) Pretenders. Frank Zappa and other more fringe(for lack of a better word) artists have found their way into moe.'s identifiable sound. Tin Cans and Car Tires is a solid collection of songs with cohesion. Plane Crash and Happy Hour Hero would have been album rock classics in another era. With a little luck and more exposure moe. can goe as far they want. Check out ""no doy"" and ""headseed"" as well."
2,Weak...,"Very weak.. there are a couple catchy songs..but the recording is sloppy, and Plane Crash is downright horrid..Moe...try again."
1,Terrible,"When I first bought this album I was so psyched. What I ended up hearing made me give the album away. This is the ""new"" moe. Its a weak attempt at getting radio friendly. Its crunchy, and it lacks soul, spirit, and most of all, the in-your-face basslines from Rob Derhak that were splattered all over the old Moe albums. Did anyone notice that some of the guitar solos in here were taken directly from old moe songs? I didn't think that that was very professional. Buy either Headseed or No Doy instead, you'll see what I mean."
5,Great Book,This book really helps you with the atc initial test. Has a compter program that is awesome.
5,Fantastico!,This is an excellent CD to introduce or reinforce Spanish with your kids. The distinction here is that these songs are legit Spanish children's songs and not made-over English songs that don't fit when transliterated.The vocals are very clear and the words are fairly easy to pick-up while listening.We absolutely love it!Que bueno!
3,A little disappointed,I like that he clearly articulates his words in the songs and the song choices are very nice however I was VERY disappointed that the entire CD was sung as if to only give a preview of all the songs. He only sings 1 or 2 verses of each song. Pay attention to the fact that there are something like 27 songs on this CD... that says it all. For this reason I wouldn't recommend buying this CD.
2,Not Serial Mouse,"Was advertised has having a serial adapter,Does not contain any adapter,so returned it to Amazon.Is not a serial mouse,even though it is advertised as one.If you need a serial mouse,do not get this one."
3,Definitely not like regular gummy bears,"The flavors are good, but the consistency is nothing like regular gummi bears.Overall I like them."
4,"Not Amazing, but that's not the aim.","These are not going to be blowing your minds out with sound quality, but they are going to be equal to the quality of the standards Apple headphones.They give you the options of colors, which is nice.They seem to fit better in the ears.Overall, They are similar sound quality to Apple's standard, but fit better and come in colors."
2,Warning!,"If you haven't read the first two Imzadi books this is a great book since both are in it. If you have, that is all this book has in it. There is no continuation. I waited forever for this book thinking it would tell what leads up to their marriage in the movie only to be horribly disappointed. No offense to Mr. David but please where is the rest of the story?!"
4,Nice book to have in your Star Trek collection!,"Nice love story for Star Trek fans, well written and its kinda fun to have part 1 and part 2 in the same book!"
1,700+ page book abridged to 3 hours of audio,This audiobook is way too abridged for the length of the written book plus the web site didn't make it clear that it was abridged. Read the book instead.
4,Excellent first book of the series,"This is the first book of the Ballantyne series (the next two are Men of Men and Angels Weep). It is a excellent tale of the conquest and colonization of Southern Africa, as seen trought the eyes of characters with different worldviews. The ruthless, egotistic Mungo St-John, shows us how a slaveowner/trader of the begining of last century saw the world, The Ballantynes, and in particular Robyn, shows us a more familiar world view, in defense of the weak. The Africans' (Bazo's in particular) caracters sow us how good a grasp Smith has of the different African cultures. It is refreshing to see a non-ideological novel. Each viewpoint is presented by its holder and no judgement is emitted. The only negative point I see about this book is Robyn's incapacity to control her libido, a trait which I find in contradiction with the rest of her caracter and which makes her a bit out-of-this world, but which will no doubt appeal to many other readers"
5,Perfect for my purse,"I had gotten this because I have arthritis in my thumb as well as carpal tunnel. I have a pen for when Im working but was looking for one for my purse. This one is very small but exactly what I needed. If you want a tiny pen, order this one."
1,Broken out of the box,"My son was really excited to try this , but unfortunately it broke like 5 minutes after we got it out of the box. I tried to change the batteries and that didn't work. I have all wood floors, so that wasn't the problem. Good idea, but I guess another quality product from China."
3,Uncle Milton's Spider,"Had the desired scary effect on office arachnophobes. It needs a smooth surface as its (hidden underneath) wheels are very smnall. Wooden flow, desktop or table is fine. On carpet it sticks but keeps waving the legs. Did move slowly on tight loop office carpet if there were no slight undulations. Easy to control and with aerial slipped up one's sleep the remote fits snugly in the palm so the fact that you are the controller is not obvious."
3,Okay,"I enjoy using this, I scared a lot of people.It just glows and looks really fake. It sucks at moving in carpet, only good on hard floor.It's okay, and still works."
1,2nd time is not a charm- Look for something else.,My Son received this as a gift and it was true love until we actually removed it from the packaging. It was broken out of the box. After exchanging it for another. It worked for approximately 15 minutes. So fragile doesn't even cover it. Its beyond cheap if a careful 6 year old with adult supervision can break it simply by pressing the remote buttons. It'll be going back for a refund.
5,Works as advertised...,....and provides plenty of scary moments when my 11 yr old is at the controls. My wife HATES spiders and this just freaks her out whenever it shows up! Revenge anyone??
3,My grandson enjoys it,I bought this remote controlled tarantula for my grandson as a joke for a Christmas present. He enjoys playing with it
1,Disappointing Polemics,"Having read the author's excellent work on the military religious orders, I frankly expected much more on this, a familiar topic. I was extremely disappointed. In addition to misstatements of fact, his main objective seemed to be to blacken the name of every Yorkist who gained the throne, as well as that of Richard, duke of York. Further, he makes the rather unpleasant Henry VII Tudor virtually into a god. All in all, the book appears to display an unfortunate animus and is overly concerned with Richard III, a subject handled with much greater dexterity by Weir and others, whether or not you agree with their conclusions. This was not a book on the Wars of the Roses, but on the general familial and cultural milieu which formed the character of Richard III. It should have been so titled."
4,Great testimony and witnessing device!,"Although not as good as ""How to live like a King's Kid,"" this book is also excellent. While perhaps too strong for non-believers, it is useful in sharing beliefs with non-charismatic Christians, and can strengthen anyone's faith in the presence of miracles in our world!"
5,THE BEST OF THE 90'S,I ENJOY THE SONG. THE BEST OF THE 90'S EVER HEARD! THANK YOU FOR THIS CD. WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE. I LISTEN TO THE MUSIC. IT'S KIND OF POPULAR SONGS I EVER HEARD. SO I LISTEN THIS CD AND I LOVE IT.
3,Good reference with vague scope...,"If you buy this book as an overview of the history and evolution of camouflage with full examples, you're going to be exceptionally disappointed. If, however, you want a reasonably good survey of current and historical infantry camouflage uniforms, this is a good reference. I've found it to be a useful tool for wargamers..."
3,"Dated, but useful for older patterns","""Brassey's Book of Camouflage"" seems to have finished collecting camouflage patterns around 2000, just before the Canadian, Jordanian, and U.S. militaries adopted patterns developed by HyperStealth Biotechnology Corp <[...]>. Because of this, it fails to incorporate the latest research in how visually disruptive work and the impact of color and pattern on the effectiveness of camo.Within its limits, it is a passable guide to military camouflage patterns from WWI through the late 1990s. It covers most countries that fielded original camo patterns, and has a brief discussion of naval camouflage.Not the most current information, but not without value.E. M. Van Court"
1,Very disappointed,"This book came without the ""squirrel"", and to my shock many of the pages were torn and even had 1/4 to 1/3 of the pages missing! This book should have been sold as in poor shape. I am not even sure I would have paid 25 cents for it if I saw it as a garage sale."
4,Good product,"the strap is excellent quality, but where it connects is plastic so you must use carefully & it's not meant for plus size people"
2,Unimpressive effort.,"The portraiture of this novel began and remained disappointingly lifeless. Despite a minor revelation to the protagonist, it remained difficult to view him with any compassion; he never entertains, shocks, or angers the reader. A catalogue of dusty arguments and tired literary maneuvers by a practiced writing hand. A few dynamics were well handled (between Thomas and his wife); but skillful handling can hardly rescue a book with very little to say. A man with spiritual crisis named Thomas?? My,my, how clever."
3,"Great sound, short life","The Dean Markley Blue Steel Acoustic guitar strings produce a beautiful, rich tone. The life of the strings is not the greatest though. These strings seem to go dead faster than other strings I have used, and tarnish very easily. These strings are great if you can afford the high price along with changing your strings every gig. Otherwise I recommend getting the Martin Marquee strings, they cost less, last longer, don't tarnish as quick and have a silky smooth, rich tone equal to or better than that of the Dean Markley Blue Steel."
5,The Crystal And The Way Of Light.,"Laying clear a unique dzogchen perspective on life, he includes very funny personal anecdotes typical of the forgotten Tibetan people."
3,Only so-so,"Normally our family loves anything Greathall Productions publishes, and anything Jim Weiss reads. But gFairytale Favorites in Story and Songh is only so-so. If this was the first ever Jim Weiss CD you bought, you would probably think it was pretty good. But compared to the other Greathall CDs, it is just not very inspired. I would recommend not purchasing this CD, but perhaps checking it out from the library if available.Here are the stories included on this CD:Stone SoupPuss in BootsThe Shoemaker and the ElvesRapunzelFairytale Favorites is appropriate for all age levels, which is why I purchased it, but neither my 2 year old nor my 6 year old found it very engaging. And I (yawn), would much rather listen to something else."
4,This is the best book I've read in a long time.,"This is a great Christian Romance Novel. I enjoy all of Lori Wick's books, but this is the very best I've read so far. Even though I'm not a princess, I could relate to the fears and feeling of the main character. I reccomend this book to anyone who want a feel good novel that inspires!"
3,Not one of Lori Wick's best forays into writing...,"I generally love everything that Lori Wick puts out, but this book fell way short of my expectations. I was a bit disappointed, as I bought the book assuming it would be as wonderful as her others. I found that the characters were unbelievable, as well as the plot, and I never really cared one way or the other how it turned out. I would not highly recommend this book. Ms. Wick has turned out many other wonderful stories, and I would suggest that you start elsewhere, or skip this one entirely."
3,The Princess was.....................,"Cute, very cute. Fairytale characters and lifestyles, perfect world, ideal romance situation, interesting conflict, nice storyline. It was a good read, but not a great one. I really liked it, but I was disapointed in some aspects. The first fault I noticed was that the way the characters acted and spoke seemed more typical of the mid eighteen hundreds than the mid 90's. Though this did disappear after the first few chapters, they still spoke and acted unrealisticly for this day and age. Something that really bothered me was that the male figure seemed to be quite superior to the female in the marriage. If this doesn't collide with your belief system, then it won't be a factor for you, but it bothered me alot. Overall a good read, but you should read it before purchasing."
2,syrup and sugar,"This book is so disappointing and the plot so underdeveloped. It's very sad because there is/was a potential to write a totally awesome story. The premise could've been really been developed into a pretty beefy, good Christian story. Unfortunately, all the the characters here are one-dimensional and flawless. In fact, Princess Shelby is so squeaky clean, she makes good ole Cinderella sound like a hack! How can these people be Christian and yet so flawless?? After all, a christian is just a sinner saved by Grace. The plot is basically anorexic; there are no subplots. The prose is mediocre, at best. I wouldn't recommmend this book to avid readers. I read it in about 3 hrs and only because I wanted to punish myself for wasting money. Everyone in the book was so sweet, I'm sure I have cavities by now!!"
2,Not as good as i thought....,"Hi,I read everyones review and thought this book would be great. I thought the book lacked something. I also thought that this book had somethings in it that i really did not want to know. Also why would a 20 year old have a heart attack? I was very disapointed in this book."
5,My first Lori Wick... and still my favorite,"This was the first Lori Wick novel that I read, back when the book was first released. Since that time I have shared the story with my 16 year old daughter, several friends, and I have reread this story of trusting in God's love for us at least three other times. I love this story! I love the character growth; I love the humananity in the characters and mostly God's plans and love for us."
4,juggling set,"My son enjoys his new juggling set, especially the balls, rings, and pins. The plate doesn't work very well, and the hems on the scarves are coming loose."
4,Good for focus/Bad for patience,My son wants to juggle so bad. He practiced for days and actually did it a couple of times. It just wasnt fast enough for him and he's put the set away. We take it out on rainy days and when we are bored and have a lot of fun watching each other fumble and/or succeed. I have no regrets in buying this product.
3,CJ fuel sending unit,"It's an adequate replacement for an original, it works for now but like all offshore reproductions it will fail within a year or two. The thin micarta rheostat insulator will warp and stop making contact with the slider. I'm on my third one so far in 8 years."
3,original bundle me better for infant,"The urban bundle me makes it impossible to prop the flap up to cover my baby due to the zipper not going up more than halfway up and the slippery nylon material. The original bundle me zips up higher and is made of fleece on the outside, and so I can now sufficiently cover her! Love the product overall!!heather, mother of 6 month old from NYC"
5,Perfect for toddlers!,"I purchased this book when I was expecting my second child and was very pleased with it. It shows a family preparing for a new baby, the arrival of the baby, as well as what takes place when there is a new baby in the house. This book gave my toddler a good idea of what to expect and gave me a jumping off point for discussing what would happen when I left for the hospital, when she would get to come see me & the baby, etc. I was also very glad to see a book that (tastefully) showed a mother nursing her newborn instead of giving it a bottle, as most ""new baby"" books do. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a young child and is expecting a baby."
4,good for the money,this product made by sony is very dependable. Its a great bargain for this high quality product. My only complaint is that the cable is a little to short for my needs. Other than that it is a great product.
5,Right on target,I just read Taming the Technology Tidal Wave and can't say enough about how much I liked it! I believe that Ms. Barker is on point in almost every case. I'm going to make sure every member of my team reads it.
5,Great Story with Cultural Diversity,"When the Web of Dreams is destroyed, and the fairies set out on a journey to find the Dream Spider (the creature needed to rebuild the web), they encounter a few surprises along the way including trolls and other fairies. The writer of this tale certainly knows girls today. The characters are as diverse, both in culture and personality, as my daughter's friends. Dragonfly is a particularly strong character, very committed to her ideals. We need more stories about young girls of color in leadership roles, making a difference in the world. I enjoyed the caffeine and insomnia bits worked into this story. The fairies also learn a valuable lesson from the Sandman - that appearances can sometimes be deceiving. I enjoyed this story even more than the first book in the series."
3,TV Tie In,"Interesting if you're a fan of TV's Stargate Atlantis. Its just a novelization of the pilot episode... just in print. There are maybe a few insights and thoughts from the characters, but otherwise its pretty much word for word with what was on TV."
1,GPX RWB4004SP 7-Channel NOAA Weatherband AM/FM Flashlight Radio with 3-Way Rechargeable Circuitry,"This is truly a piece of CRAP.The first thing I did was to install the 6 AA batteries, instantly my eyes lit up for the clock was working. I found the clock simple to set. Then it was down hill from there. The crank did not work the AM/FM radio did not work.You get what you pay for,$[...] +s/h too good to be true. Lesson well learned.Advise spent the extra money and get a brand name weatherband radio."
3,Good for under $30,"I looked at a lot of emergency radios and this one came out on top. The weather station in Los Angeles comes in crystal clear, even running off just the dynamo. The hand crank is sturdy enough. The radio works well, but it works best with the batteries in it. The tuner is sensitive, but once you get it on a station, it sticks. The flashlight is OK. The emergency siren is OK. The back battery panel is going to pop open if you drop it. Although this product is multi-purpose, in a real emergency I will only care about the hand crank, the flashlight, and the weather (emergency broadcast) station.Three years later we had to use this for real during a fire in the area. It worked, but it sure required a LOT of cranking."
1,Way Way Way too difficult,"Way, way way too difficult. The training level is more difficult than the final level in a game should be."
4,Good shoe,"I bought these for Krav-Maga. Shoes are very light, offer good support, yet enough foot mobility to point toes for front kicks or roundhouse kicks with shin/shoe lace area of the foot. It took about 2 and a half years of 2-3 intense classes per week to wear the rubber sole through at the right toe. The rest of the shoe held up great."
1,Making it easy for breastfeeding moms to give up,"This book makes it easy for breastfeeding moms to give up and not feel guilty about it. If you think you will cop out and want to feel better about yourself, buy this book ...and do what's best for your child."
3,"OK, But I've Had Better","I was hoping for a stronger scent- this should almost be labled ""fragrance free"". It left my hair a little limp and with a residue, but I've got really long hair, so maybe someone with short hair wouldn't notice that."
5,Highly Recommended,"I bought these primarily for some whale watching over on Maui. They are a bit pricey, but the outstanding quality of the optics is worth it. The rubberized casing is excellent for holding onto without loosing your grip. I also wear glasses and had no problem using the Brunton with my glasses because of their twist up eye relief system.These binocs are very lightweight so no problem holding them steady. I had originally considered going with one of Canon's image stabilization binocs, but chose these instead because the quality of the glass was far superior. I do own a nice Canon DSLR, but it seems the glass in their binocs do not quite match up to quality in their camera lenses."
4,Defining fractals,"If you've been curious about what ""fractals"" means, this is a good dvd to watch.Probably it would be best understood by mathematical minds, but it definitely brings one more up to speed with this new word in our lexicon...oil mining included."
5,ATCG,"We take our first baby steps to understanding our world and it's history.This film illustrates some of those steps.Stunning HD presentation.By now it should be painfully obvious that evolution is fact.However, there are 18 letters (DNA) that make humans different from chimps.IMHO I think there might have been some manipulation at some point. Proof of that would be the real stunner...Who? What? When? Why?I had a heart attack a year ago. Time for me is precious. I do NOT waste it now. Time watching this film is time well spent indeed!Highly recommended.""How the Earth was made"" (History channel) is another very good DVD too."
5,Stargate keeps going,I enjoy the fact that stargate the original movie story line continued as a series then this movie that answers alot of questions that were hanging. Can't wait for the next one.
3,Average At Best,"Let's face the facts. Stargate SG-1 ran out of gas around Season 6 or 7. The last three years of the series, the program was sucking on fumes. I hate to say that, because I loved watching the program when Richard Dean Anderson was starring. I have to say I only bought the 'Ark of Truth' because they left the Ori plot line dangling when the final season ended. To be honest, I felt cheated out of my money for this DVD. Granted, the producers had more money for creating a longer, more special effects laden product. Unfortunately they forgot the plot. I always had the impression that the Ori, this supposedly invincible foe, was going to end with a whimper. That is how it felt to me. Did we really need a plot line that had the Replicators involved one more time? How many times do you need to defeat them before they go away, permanently? I will have to think long and hard about shelling out for the second installment, Continuum. Three stars for what the series originally offered the fans."
2,Why was Jack left out,Not what I expected. And Jack's charactor wasn't in the movie which was a downer! The TV episodes were better than this movie.
4,What a great movie --------- very entertaining....,"When I first watched this I chose to view the longer version - a review of segments from certain episodes featured in the TV show leading up to the beginning of this movie - that caught me up on some things that I had not yet seen and helped me understand where the story in the movie takes off from......I found it very entertaining, and a good story line, answered a lot of questions but still left the story open for continuing movies. After 10 years of being on TV - the show has a good following and we all hope they keep on making these movies with the characters from the shows....I recommend this to all SG1 fans!"
4,Why????,"I adore Stargate, and cannot wait for the movies, if only to see the conclusion.The sad fact is, this is one of the only SciFi shows that could continue on after 10 seasons without over-using the plotlines. I'm sad that it as been cancelled due to human greed and stupidity."
3,"Good, but not great","This film is a worthy attempt to capture the ongoing saga of the Stargate SG-1 phenomena, however, it does not reach the height that Stargate Continuum did. It is still worthwhile science fiction and both employs and contains marvelous visual imagery, definately worth the special effects represented."
3,"Close, but not quite there","This movie is a good fix for a Star Gate junkie like myself. I've enjoyed Stargate SG-1 since very early on. I didn't find this movie very compelling. The story line was good, but not that good. It was in may ways predictable. It had a few surprises. The special effects were very good, but the storyline itself wasn't that great to me. I like Continuum much better than this movie. Do I think it is a worthwhile addition to my SG-1 collection - absolutely - they had me at the opening lines!"
2,Ho-Hum,"I'm a big sci-fi fan and a huge Stargate fan ... have watched it from day one. I agree completely with the review written by Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower"", so I won't repeat what the Captain said. I will add a little though. Since this was a made-for-DVD movie, one would have expected something more than what ended up being a 1hr 40min TV show without commercials. All the acting was terrific as usual, and the special affects were great, and the subtle humor moments were classic Stargate, but the plot was just gone. It was as if the writers handed over the job of writing the plot as a 9th-grade class assignment. As the Captain said, ""too simple""! The whole Ori problem has been a really cool idea in the last season of SG1, and this movie was the perfect opportunity to continue the cool Ori story, but it just fizzled out."
2,not great,this was great disapointment as the last show for such a great series.It had no plot. It was just a series of random scenes mixed together.
5,Great Ending to a Great Series,"As a huge fan of the SG-1 series I was pretty upset over the cancellation of the show, especially with the new bad guys in town: the Ori. Suffice to say, this movie was a great wrap-up to end an amazing series. The only thing that would have been better was if the series was never cancelled and there could've have been an extra season or two of episodes to tidy things up.The one drawback I found with the movie was how the movie seemed compressed in an effort to finish the Ori story in a clean manner. While the movie did a great job of tying up loose ends, it felt rushed compared to 10 seasons of episodes. It's just a shame that Richard Dean Anderson didn't at least make a cameo appearance (at least he'll be playing a big role in Stargate: ContinuumStargate: Continuum)Regardless of the relatively minor drawbacks (which are unavoidable when attempting to close out a series as great as Stargate SG-1)this is a must have for anyone who followed the series)"
4,Stargate - The Ark of Truth DVD,"With the last of the Stargate series, it was good to have one more story with details filling in and completing parts that were left unfinished. I enjoyed it very much and am sorry to know they have completed their mission. Not much in the way of good Sci-Fi now.This DVD is worth having in your Stargate collection."
5,Great Movie!!,"If you love Stargate, and hated to see it end, this movie continues where SG1 left off. I can't wait for the next movie!!"
2,Worse than any episode,"You'd think the Stargate folks could handle this two-hour-straight-to-DVD medium, since they do many two and three-part episodes. But, apparently, without these cliffhanger-inducing structural constraints, they are completely lost. The replicator battles were particularly mind-numbing ... for how long were we supposed to stay excited about endless machine-gun fire at CGI scrap-metal? It brought to the foreground the biggest weakness of the Stargate franchise: its tendency to fall into the most mindless fantasy-militarism imaginable, in this case through unquestioned adoration of massive firefights."
3,"I loved the Ori storyline, but this movie is just average.","I was a bit underwhelmed by this movie, despite my passionate interest in the stargate universe and my appreciation of the ori storyline.I thought the Ori were a great evolution of the stargate story, but this concluding chapter was a bit of a let-down. Many other reviewers commented on the various specifics, but basically if you've seen the rest of the Ori saga in seasons 9 & 10 you'll want to see this movie. It just isn't as good as it could have been."
5,Excellent Ending,I would highly recommend this movie if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan. This finalizes the story arch about the Ori. They tied up all of the loose ends very nicely. The movie was well written and really draws you in to the story.I couldn't recommend this enough and I'm anxiously awaiting the next movie.
4,Good Ending to the Ori Story line,"The Art of Truth was an interesting and fast paced ending to the SG-1 Ori storyline, tying up some loose ends along the way. I thought the movie could have benefitted from being a little longer (2 hours or so instead of about an hour and a half), especially since we were left with such an open ending of the regular series. There could have been some more historical scenes and some better explanations of things that needed to be wrapped up from the series. However, overall I feel that the movie is a pretty good wrap up of the story. It definitely had some great music (adding a symphony orchestra rather than synthesized music is almost always better in my book) and awesome visual effects (a bigger movie budget always helps not that the series had bad effects by any means). Hopefully, future movies will wrap up a few more things as well as introducing some new ideas."
3,Anti-climatic,"I was expecting a bit more for the conclusion of the Ori story arc. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the ending. They seemed to wrap it up too quickly. The beginning of the movie built the story up and then they pull out something that has been beaten to death in other seasons.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, however I was disappointed with the conclusion. I own all 10 seasons of SG-1 and the first 3 seasons of Atlantis on DVD, but somehow I think Ark of Truth could have been better."
2,Worse than an average episode,I am a fan of the series - I've seen every episode at least twice. I also liked the last two or three seasons. So I was very disappointed when this movie turned out to be quite boring. That is mostly due to the bad script and bad action sequences.
2,Team chemistry not there,"I'm a new (and very late) fan to the Stargate Series... catching up on all of the shows via DVD, and bought Ark of Truth, and wow...the first thing I noticed was a lack of chemistry between the ""new"" team. It's also disturbing that Lt. Col Mitchell gets the lead the command when Carter has been there the longest. Also, the writer chose to divide SG1 into 3 separate units during their off world crisis. Special effects are ok, but nothing more extrordinary than what we see on the tv show. This could have been a 2parter on SciFi Channel instead.I also usually enjoy DVD commentary on a film, this was basically 90mins of the writer/director patting himself on the back about camera angles and lighting. No insight into the story or characters...perhaps because the story was weak."
1,"This is a joke, right?","You've simply got to be kidding me. Monster Cable for a telephone line? This is, quite simply, one of the more ridiculous products to come down the pike. Monster used to be a reliable brand name, and I use thier interconnects for my home theater system, but it seems like they'll put their name on any crap these days.Caveat Emptor - you do NOT need this product."
1,A phone cable is a phone cable when...,"I was shocked when a co-worker told me they bought this cable. I had to tell them, it is a waste of money. Gold contacts and ten feet of special wire will do you little good for your internet connection, when the rest of your house probably has 100 feet of copper wire and forget about terminal connections. You are at the mercy of the telephone company and your ISP when it comes to Internet connection speed. Sorry. Russ"
2,Saving grace: it's cheap.,"Questions+answers are arranged redundantly, information is dated, and there's just not a lot in there. Very amateurish. Bordering absurd. Probably should have given it 1 star when I think about it."
2,Nihilism,"Making people laugh is the lowest form of humor, according to the late Michael O'Donoghue.Well, Firesign is heading in that direction with this album. They try to maintain a dark atmosphere for effect's sake, but largely this album is only untraceable puns and retreaded jokes. The new characters created here are not funny or even amusing as stereotypes.The fellows are old, and they don't like the era in which we live. They've gone from social commentators to borscht belt humor in this one...good thing Boom Dot Bust was better!"
3,It wasn't great but...,"It wasn't great fiction, but it kept me turning the pages - I just had to know who messed with the old lady's will. Unfortunately, I figured out whodunnit long before the end, but it still was gratifying to think, ""Ah-hah! I knew it!""Good book to read on a trip."
2,Disappointing characters,"This was my first BP book, and I found Gail Connor to be rather unlikable. She alternates between over-protecting and neglecting her daughter, uses people to get what she wants, takes drugs when she gets overwhelmed at work, and justifies stealing based on who's more deserving. Her client often acted like a jerk, so I found it hard to care who won.Most of the secondary characters were likable - I found it hard to believe they cared so much about Gail.I'd recommend any of Robert Parker's books over this - his characters are honest, intelligent and clever, and the relationships are believable."
2,Very Disappointing!,"This book reads like a textbook. It sites research about the physiology of stress on the body. It also sites reasons to change your diet to aide your body's response to stress. It made me anxious to change my stress level, but it didn't give many practical tips for implementing stress-reducing measures in my life."
4,"Nice book, great photos!","It was not as through as I had anticipated, however, I did find the recipes that I was looking for and the instructions are very well written."
2,lookin' for danger? this AIN'T it.,"well, well, well. where to start? where are the BROWN people in this book? are they *too* dangerosa for the editors? Yes, yes, I know there is a few, but few and far between. why so many of these poets have only one book? could their careerist attitudes only get them into one contest win and kaput, it's done. I say hurrah to anyone who wants to teach dangerous work, but this book ain't it. sure there are glimpses of deadpan genius throughout, but nothing that i wouldn't just call ""quirky""--definitely NOT dangerous. Where is the west coast richness of verve and moxie? and where is jennifer moxley? i'm all for teaching some of these folks individually, but to call it definitive and dangerous, well, that's jes pure false advertising."
3,Ethernet Cord,I mainly got this because I liked the bright yellow color. It's more of a nude beige color :( Nothing like the picture- major let down. But I mean it works great. Awesome length.
5,The Best Read of the Bunch,"Of all the books written about the exploits of Easy Company, and I've read many (Ambrose, Winters, Malarky, Compton), this is by far the best of the bunch. Unlike the others, this book was written from a collection of notes that Webster, a writer, kept while fighting in WWII. He was a member of the 101st and close to all that we know from the mini-series and other books. However, his tome is written while the memories are fresh in his mind (he disappeared in 1961), unlike other E Company writings penned decades after they occurred. Plus, he is the writer. This is not an ""as told to"", or ""written with"" memoir. A superb and spell-binding account of WWII."
4,WWII Paratrooper,"Webster is a fantastic writer. The memoir feels very fresh, since he wrote it soon after the war. The only negative thing I have to say is that Webster's personality is a little different than the other 'Band of Brothers'. I don't know how fair this criticism is, because it may just be his nature. I have read the books of the other men from Easy Company, and they just seem different..they have more of a ""professional"" outlook on the war. Don't get me wrong, I know that not every soldier has the same experiences or gung-ho attitude, but I just wanted to make this comment on him. If you have seen the series, the episode that focuses somewhat on Webster is very different from the way he tells things. Bottom line is, you will not be dissapointed in this book in any way if you love this sort of history."
2,Fair to Poor,"Moseley's book, although helpful in counteracting some of the effects of an overly Christo-centric theology based on the gentile patristics, does not do justice to the teachings of the Apostle Paul, but seems to relegate his thoughts to mere midrashim. Be careful with this book."
2,Misleading title,"I was disappointed with this book. With ""Yeshua.."" being the title, I expected the book to talk about more about Jesus, and explaining the things he did and said from a Jewish perspective. But the great majority of the book was more of a history of the Pharisees. There were a few interesting points, but I didn't want to read about the history of the Pharisees and the various sects and how they interacted with each other."
4,Good Quality Cables,I am very happy with these cables and the sound and video they deliver. I only have one complaint which is the cables are very tight when pushed onto the rca jacks for the audio. When you try to pull them off they are difficult to pull off because they grip the rca posts so tightly. This condition may get better as they are used more.
2,too much money for it not to last longer!,"this bag only lasted for about 3 months. the adjustable clip broke, so it's sitting in my closet looking pretty."
2,"An interesting idea, but","This is a nice book really in need of a good edit. Like a lot of the self-publihsed books nowadays, it is obvious there is talent out there which needs to be helped along by professionals. All of the flaws detract from the whole reading experience, but if you are interested in a fresh, lively voice, try it."
5,Favorite Author,I read the Bride of the McHugh years ago and was unaware that Jan Cox Speas wrote other novels. This one is also excellent. I like that she can create a romantic and engaging novel without being graphic...a real talent!
4,After 2 months from ordering I finally received the book 2-16-13,"I know you made good on finally sending me the book. But I had already bought one elsewhere. I appreciate your effort but would like to send this book back. I don't need two of the same book.I hope Amazon gives you your privileges back. I to know how hard it is to keep a job and make money for the family. I'm not a heartless person, just one that likes to see things done right.Sincerely,Barbara Rager"
5,I LOVE DOCTOR WHO!,Doctor Who is the ultimate series. Only bad thing I can say is I wish David Tennant would come back :(Whatever you do... DON't BLINK!
4,The season's off to a good start,"A good, solid, episode with a bit of humor and a few thrills. There's none of the sheer terror you'd find in a Weeping Angels episode, or the nightmarish horror of ""Asylum of the Dalek."" Sure, there's always an element of alien terror, but nothing that the Doctor can't handle. There's a lot on what the Ponds have been up to lately, more on Rory's father, the introduction of the daughter of a character from the old series, and a few other surprises. Telling any more would be, well, telling, and if you haven't seen this one I don't want to spoil it for you. I'd say this is my second or third favorite of the season so far."
3,"Awesome Production, Confused Morality","Let me start by saying that everything in this episode looks and sounds gorgeous. I don't know where they get the money for this, but the quality is phenomenal.The actual story is pretty interesting (no spoilers though). Unfortunately, the Doctor is forced to switch between a ton of outlooks on one issue. The issue is grounds for interesting discussion, but the Doctor seems very inconsistently portrayed in this episode. Taking itself a little less seriously would have been a huge boon here.Overall I enjoyed it, but it isn't classic Dr.Who by any means."
1,Don't buy,It's just the first the three minutes of the episode. It's included in the actual episode. Just buy that. I made the mistake of not reading the description carefully enough. Don't make the same mistake.
5,Dr. Who,"I got hooked on the 'New' Dr. Who through NetFlix and watched all 90 episodes up through Season 6. Since I was too late to catch Season 7 on TV I decided to purchase through Amazon.I'm happy to say that this season, so far, has lived up to the standards and expectations that were set during the previous 6 seasons. I'm looking forward to the Christmas Special and the balance of Season & as well as Dr. Who's 50th Anniversary next year."
3,High Expectations,I have been a huge fan of Doctor Who since it rebooted. Every season has kept me captivated. this season was supposed to be their prized jewel. Instead it fell short of previous seasons. Hopefully things pick up in the second half.
1,THIS IS NOT A FULL EPISODE,I am so frustrated. From the title and price I assumed it was a half length (30 min) episode of Doctor Who. It was not. It was a 5 minute preview of the first episode. Every single shot in this preview is in the full length episode. DO NOT BUY THIS.
1,Not a prequel...only a preVIEW,This is NOT an episode... merely an advertisment/preview of an episode. If I had seen the runtime was only 3 minutes I wouldn't have paid .99 just to see the first 3 minutes of the *episode* that I bought for $2.99.*Sigh* Ya got me Amazon... I just paid a dollar to be advertised to...
1,Disappointing,"It's my own fault for not investigating further, but this is basically a 3 minuter teaser and I just paid .99 plus local taxes to watch it thinking it was an entire episode.Please don't be a fool like me a pay for this unless you really want to."
1,seriously? this should be free,"This is just a few minutes long and should therefore not be at the same price as a full episode. Seriously regret clicking the link without reading the review. Misleading labeling as a 'prequel,' its a long cliffhanger commercial. I expect more honest pricing Amazon."
5,Hilarious!,"This series seems to be one of the best ever. So far only 2 episodes in and both are strong, funny, and action packed!"
5,Off to a good start!,"The service:I'm streaming the episodes to my ps3 in HD with no issues. I can only get non-HD BBC America in my area and then parts get cut out to make room for commercials. Now for just a little over $2 an episode, I get HD quality, no sync issues, no commercials, no cut content. I'm very happy this is available now.The new episodes:Asylum of the Daleks: Maybe I've been watching too much sci-fi, but in the first episode I saw the plot twist coming a mile away. This did not stop my enjoyment of this episode. I wasn't completely sold with the subplot between Amy and Rory. My wife and I both loved this episode.Dinosaurs on a Spaceship:Much more lighthearted than the first episode. Some very goofy moments. I had a good time watching this one."
5,Brilliant,This prequel should have been part of the main episode or shown before the episode premier because it seems very important. Hopefully they build up more on what occurred here and whom the person is.
5,Fantastic!,LOVE the doctor and this series has me on pin and needles waiting for each new episode! It's fantastic and Brilliant :)
5,Poor girl,"But thanks to her, the good Doctor is given a clean slate. My family love the 5/6/7 seasons. Thanks to Amazon Prime for letting us enjoy these TV Shows."
5,Trust me,"I'm not going to tell you anything at all about the plot, because if anyone had summarized these plots for me, I would have thought they sounded lame and I wouldn't have watched them. If you are a doctor fan, this may be one of your favorite seasons. So far, it's one of mine. It's interesting because I think these writers are probably the British national treasure right now. Scratch that, they are putting out the best sci fi around right now. Don't read the previews, seriously, just watch the first episode."
3,this season so far...,"seems a bit too fast paced. not enough time to establish any sort of emotion. Though in the last episode i did tear up at the rory and amy scene, but in this one the scene when the dinosaur died....i couldnt care less. there werent any ""universal truths"" like there are in the great DW episodes...I dont know, something felt missing. The stakes in this episode was not that big of a deal really, just some old guy and 2 pretty nice robots...idk. I just miss that feeling i used to get in the david tennant era and even in the last season, that feeling like ""how the hell are they gonna get out of this one...theres no way!"" you know what i mean? i dont mean to sound like a knit picker.The kiss was awesome though!"
1,Charge a buck for a 3 min prequel?,"I came here to purchase the season pass but refuse to pay a buck for the prequels. My god even apple does not do such a thing, for shame Amazon. I for one will be getting my Who fix elsewhere."
4,It is what it says on the tin,"If you look at the title ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and think ""That's silly. I won't like it,"" then you won't. If you look at that title and think ""F*#$ yes I want dinosaurs on a spaceship. And throw in some Egyptians,"" then you will. As a bonus, Mitchell and Webb!"
1,Asylum of the daleks prequel,It is a commercial! I should have paid attention before purchase! My own fault... Do not be fooled. You get this free it you purchase the season so don't waste your money.
3,Loosing originality,"I'm a fan, but the fact is that the new series are getting predictable with not as much extremely creative antagonists makes me think the series is not going in a good way"
5,Chalk Full of Emotions,"A Town Called Mercy is not the usual sci-fi mystery you've probably come to expect from Doctor Who. Instead, it's an emotional confrontation of the new darkness the Doctor has adopted into his heart without his human companions to keep him company. Doesn't hurt that they create an awesome new analogous race to the Time Lord's.A must see episode in the stunning series."
3,3 Minds Combined!!!,"This album is definitely no ""Special Edition"". Thats one of a kind, but overall the album is HOT!! I gave it 3 stars because I do skip through a couple of tracks, but for the most part I can sit and chill to it. The DVD is a must have for all of QB fans and grimeys. The Alchemist only produced one track this time and believe me that one track is fiyah. I can tell the producers on the album has a little Alchemist in them. Favorite track is ""Who We Ride For"", favorite IM3 artist is Twin, and overall coolest is Godfather Pt. III. Get the album because yall get more than your money's worth. Straight like that!"
1,No longer as advertised...,"Green Mountain recently (and inexplicably) discontinued their ""Hazelnut Cream"" brand. I came here hoping to pick some up, and ordered two cases. Much to my surprise, what was delivered was not ""Hazelnut Cream"" -- which other reviewers have noted is the best of all flavors -- but just plain ""Hazelnut,"" which tastes like a mix of liquified dirt and bitters.In short, do not expect Hazelnut Cream -- you will be getting ""Hazelnut,"" which tastes horrendous."
1,$216 to fix?!?,"My wife and I purchased this item 7 months ago and it has stopped working already. Sony has offered to pay for the parts to fix it, but the labor will cost $216!! We only paid $250 for the camcorder!Buy another brand and avoid this type of [...]!!"
3,"Good, but unreliable in areas","We mainly bought this camera to take on our Bahamas cruise. We had played with it around the house & everything seemed great, & we were looking forward to being able to have some video of our vacation. The zoom is great. However, almost every time we took the camera out to use, it wouldn't work! Apparently, going from an air-conditioned cabin to the humidity outside was too much for it, & it wouldn't operate. Someone else on our cruise said they had the same problem. We always keep the camera in its case, & we didn't anticipate this problem at all. So, unfortunately, we didn't get a lot on video, & we were quite disappointed. The camera was lucky it's not at the bottom of the Caribbean!"
4,Improved internet and telephone reception,"We have the 25 foot cable for our internet connection and the ten foot cable on our phone. Big improvement over the standard phone cord. No static on the phone, better resolution on the monitor."
3,Solid build - Seek compatible connector info before purchase.,"One wonders why 'RJ45/CATV F' is part of the title of the tool as it is supposed to crimp a variety of different connectors for various applications.No complaints about build quality. Seems solid in that regard.Before buying this tool however, carefully ascertain the brands and model numbers of the connectors that are compatible with the tool and die set combinations.Do not trust tool suppliers as I did. Many of them don't know and apparently don't care so long as the tool leaves the stock room. I now have two sets of BNC AND F connnectors that were recommended and proven useless.I was also not impressed with Paladin USA. Prospective purchasers have a lot of choices with respect to brands. Why have an evidently good product and not have readily availabe updated information on what will work with it?"
1,Disappointing,"We received a Sunbeam electric blanket as a gift and after one year it stopped working, we bought another one and I even bought the electric throw, one year later they both stopped working.Very disappointed in Sunbeam products after 3 products with the same problem of no longer working after a year, it is definitely a product problem.Do not buy this product!"
1,Lacking in useful information,"The book is titled as if it is providing a lot of useful information. Instead, what you will find is 192 pages of mostly generalized backpacking information.It's mostly ""take what you need"" and have fun.I would not recommend this book for any purpose - although it has a list of P.O.'s in the back which some may find of value. I would suggest the A.T. Data Book for this info. though."
5,Clear understanding of hypnosis and behavior,This book clears up all the mystery about hypnosis and gives step by step instruction on how to change unwanted behavior.
4,Massage Bolster,"Did not ship as quickly as I needed it. Good Bolster. I thought it would be cheap quality because of the price. However, it works good and it comfy. Thanks."
2,not to helpful,do not like this book-hard to use. I need a reference book that was easier to understand. This was not what I waslooking for. I am a young Christian. I have trouble understanding some words that are used in thebible.
3,Fun,"Very nice book, well illustrated with many representations of what a garden may be. However, too many photos of gardens full of tat, make this a slight dissapointment. Would make a fun gift for an enthusiast."
1,Product arrived deflated,"Product arrived on time, but it is almost completely deflated. So now we have to go buy a pump to blow up the ball... which defeats the purpose of buying it online."
5,Four-point spider's web truck bed net.,"This was a replacement for a worn out 5-year old net. My truck bed only has four attachment points and this was the only net design that could accomodate that since no matter what the shape of the object restrained by the net, the securing forces are uniformly distributed by the cobweb geometry (spirals/concentric circles around a central hub). The net came with flimsy plastic hooks but I simply bought some brass hitch hooks and looped the four corners of the net onto them. The material used is of quality and should last another 5 years outdoors."
2,Oh Please!,"Although this book is well written and flows well, the content is at times laughable. The author paitnts a picture of these poor women as totally helpless. They go about missing appointments making excusses, as to why they can't make appointments or fill out papers. I thought it was halarious when the author wanted the reader to fell bad because one of the women didn't know how to eat pizza. She kept going on about how hard it is to get welfare and that the government shoudn't ask for ID or proof of need. Hey, while there at it why not just drop bags loads of money out of the sky?I think the author did these women a disservice as she made them out to be so helpless and stupid."
5,Excellent!,A great book for someone contemplating entering the speaking/seminar business. I discovered the National Speakers Association through this book.
2,Not much help.,This book will not lead you to a single speaking engagement. If you are serious about the speaking business contact the National Speakers Association.
4,Hilarious kids coming of age movie.,"In this present world of inner city gangstas and wanna be thugs this 1991 comedy based in New Yorks South Bronx is a reminder to anybody that growing up can be fun. The characters are male and streetwise yet do not threaten. They are each different but truly love to laugh and be funny. Their priority is to hit on women especially Vinny whose real name is Fernando played by (Nestor Serrano) who is a Puerto Rican American trying hard to pass for Italian thinking this will give him an edge with the ""girlies"". You've seen Vinny before in John Travoltas version of ""Babarino"" on Welcome back Kotter, however it's the early 90's and the world is a tougher place. It's pre gunshots and drivebys and although not glamorously edited it's content involves those people you already know or should."
5,Perfect for my needs,I do a lot of mailing to clients and employees. These are great. I just print out a full sheet for each client or employee and slap one on a blank envelope. They look almost as good as if the envelopes were professionally printed.
5,Fun,oh boy how fun can this get. jada pinket smith plays crazy woo. shes psycho. shes funny. she rocks. woo rules and other black movies stand up to it. just see it if youve been through a date from hell.
5,Tasha from Backyardigans,My daughter loves Backyardigans and when I opened the package and took Tasha out-my daughter's eyes lit up. Tasha is even more cute than I thought-the detail on her dress is exactly like the one she wears on tv. The package arrived quickly and Tasha looked exactly like the seller described. I will definitely order products from this seller again.
5,Great,This was the only backyardigan we couldn't find. Waited anxiously for her to arrive for our little one. Shipped fast and in great condition! Thanks!
1,cape refuge,"I got to chapter 6. Johnathon is arrested by Cade. On no evidence except a missing spear gun and he the only known owner of such a gun. For MURDER ! What baloney ! I am a retired dentist and I could have defended this case.This author knows NOTHNG about police procedure, evidence, or jurisprudence at ALL!"
2,so preachy,I was looking for mystery. What I found was boring and preachy. This is not a book for anyone who is not a rabid christian.
1,Not worth the money,"Ok for keys, to big and bulkey for my remotes. Sometimes had to be standing over the item for it to pickup the signal."
3,"Cool design, complicated instructions","This looks like a real robot. It can perform quite a few actions. The downside is the owners manual. It isn't really clear, is too tabular in terms of instructions, lacks clear explanations and kind of leads you to the conclusion that the robot doesn't really do as many things as advertised. Actually programming it to do a particular task would take quite a long time."
5,Roboquad is just plain cool to watch!,"I love Gadgets, but robotic toys have always been a letdown. They did not really live up to my expectations. I had a Robotic Dog that took so long getting through the startup process, the batteries were almost fully depleted by the time you really got to play with it. Quad is different...He is fun to watch, and examines everything! He does need a lot of room, but he is my favorate robot yet. you could even mount a wireless camera on his head and have him roam around the house recording!The robot also does a pretty cool demo dance! When I bought him, it was about $80.00..a little high....now, I think the price is well worth it. I love seeing how each generation of robots gets better and better and Roboquad shows that the trend continues!"
3,A little lackluster at times...,"While the overall setting and plot of the book are interesting, and I would KILL to have a society wherein the local professor of Alchemy is the most popular instructor at the school, the writing of Ms. Cunningham just isn't up to the standards I expect of authors I enjoy. She seems a bit of a misandrist, personally. While her male characters do gain redemption by the end of the book, I found the resolution to be trite and unbelievable. I checked out another of her books at the library, but will send it back unread. There wasn't much I can say I learned from this book, or even much that I was moved by this book. These ideas, to me, are what makes a book memorable. This one, unfortunately, really wasn't."
5,great album,"you must to buy this one, a great venezuelan rock band, the rock sounds good in spanish too, i want a new album of this band"
4,Very good TV,"I have been very pleased with this TV. I bought the 26"" one first and then bought the 23"" for the bedroom. My only problem with it is really my fault. It is a wide screen and I didn't notice that before I purchased them. So all the people look a little bit fatter than they really are. Maybe that's a good thing for all the Hollywood stars and models. I would recommend this TV to anyone."
4,Frank Jr,"Great tv have the samsung 46"" also. Great picture quality and features. Do not have hdtv box hooked up to 23"" just digital signal, which we are using in the bedroom , but are receiving local channels in high def because of tuner. The 46"" is hooked up to hd box and is awesome. Would reccommend this product."
4,A perfect 2nd bedrrom TV,"Havent compared side to side products, but did a lot of research online on quality and read reviews, and this came out to be a good product in price and performance. I did want to go more with the Sharp Aquos, but ultimately got a good deal on this.The black look compliments mose interior finishes (unlike the white). The picture quality is very good - and I am only talking normal (not HD) signals, HD surely will look even better on the TV.The connectivity option son this is what made me get this model - 2 HDMI, 2 S-Video and all other normal options.I use the S-Video with my laptop too (play my streaming movies on the TV from the laptop) and the other one comes in handy for the normal DVD player. Haven't used the HDMI connections yet.In short - I like the TV quite a lot. My wife appreciates the aesthetic look of the TV and my kid wants to play all her kiddie movies on this now, instead of on the older CRT TV set in the other room."
5,Love this TV,Have not had a moment's trouble with this TV since I purchased it several months ago. No issues when setting it up. Picture looks great.
3,Doesn't leave an impression that Bellow was a nice man,"For Bellow fans, this slim book does give an insider's view of a very small portion of his creative life, written as it was by his literary agent of 25 years. In the final chapters, which relate how Bellow dumped her, late in his life, when he clearly did not need every dollar he could get, for another agent who wooed him by saying that he thought he could do better for him with his backlist. That makes Bellow seem like more of a money grubber than the great writer that he was."
3,phone problems,"i like to use this phone 4 the business that i do. The problem i have is that when i put my phone in the case and put it on my belt, it always calls the person that just called or that i just called back. I really hate that and i hate the button that you use to take pictures and videos is like on the edge and cant take pictures quite right they will come out blurry sometimes."
2,Under-powered,"I have been using the T-Mobile Wing for about a week now and it is a disappointment. With only a 200mhz processor and 64 mb RAM, it often runs out of available memory and applications hang. If you are looking for the full functionality of a PDA, then this falls short of it's potential.My previous PDA was an Ipaq 4155 running Windows Mobile 2002, and needless to say, that PDA was faster than this device."
1,Garbage Phone,"This is the worst phone that I have ever had. The phone has some really cool features, but the overall usage of those features makes this phone totally garbage. T-Mobile should be ashamed of themselves for even continuing to sell this phone. It freezes up like a computer. Sometimes the touch screen feature on the phone works, but most of the time it doesn't. God forbid you want to power the phone off, you have to hold the button for an extended period of time. And then on top of that, you lose recent text messages and other information. Forget about answering an incoming call. The phone rings, however you aren't able to answer it. And you can't even see who's calling. If I knew about this phone beforehand, I would have never purchased it. My advice to anyone looking to purchase a new cell phone, visit various sites to see what the customer reviews are. They are the best indicators as to whether a phone will work for you or not."
1,Windows 6 is too slow on this device,"This device doesn't have enough resource to run Windows Pocket 6.0 properly.You end up restarting your phone like 10 times a day. If you have more than 100 contacts and receiving 25 or more email a day then this device is not for you. Exchange sync keeps failing most of the times, and almost every time you run 2 applications at the same time phone fails and requires restart.The device itself is kind of heavy but it has a good design. I like the color. It has a poor battery life.I switched to Blackberry 8820, and I am pretty happy now."
1,Don't Bother,"I purchased this book online, and was quite excited about reading it. I was sorely disappointed. The book was very one-sided and does not give a very accurate representation of the industry. Though I share some of Volpe's beliefs (I am a vegetarian) I encourage people who are interested in this topic to read a different book, FAST FOOD NATION by Eric Schlosser, which is one of my favorites and contains far more information. Volpe's book reads like a dumbed-down version of Scholosser's book crossed with a PETA film (which is just a different kind of misinformation than the meat companies offer us). Volpe's book also ignores the human suffering that accompanies the meat industry, a VERY good reason to be a vegetarian. I wish I had nicer things to say, because I WANTED to like this book. I can't even donate it to the library; I don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did."
2,Not OK for Italy,"I ended up needing an additional adapter once I got to Italy - this one didn't fit into the wall socket. Once I laid hands on the other adapter, it worked."
2,Not what I wanted,"These two features by L and H are not really all that funny. I was expecting another ""Sons of the Desert"" but no such luck. I have a ten year old boy who had recently discovered Laurel and Hardy, and even he was disappointed in these. Will have to look for something else to fill the bill."
2,hard,"this game is hard, i odred this thinking it was like the snes game and it was not in fact its really hard...and to make things worse is i already had it an didnt even know it since it had been that long since i played it..lol my fault yea i know but funny when i open the drawer an seen the game box i was like oh crap no wonder my memory card knew i had history...lol funny story...but yea this game is somewhat hard..."
2,Konami FAILED HARD on this one. =/,"Really, this is a good Game, but the only real reason why I Bought it was for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, it was my most Favorite Game when I was Little and unfotunatly, I have Lost my Copy for the PS1. Now, I know from Reviews that they Changed the Voiceovers and such, but Seriously? They don't even Sound right, and they Changed all of the dioalogue! I'm honestly not going to buy another Castlevania Game unless it's the Original, because I Wasted $20 on a Game that I probably won't even Play now, thank god I Bought FFVII:Crysis Core when I bought this. =/Pros: If you like Castlevania's that're Sidescrollers you're going to Like this game and it's Graphics are a bit Vamped. (No Pun intended.)Cons: Castlevania Symphony of the Night was completely Changed, there's no reason for it, Konami can and should Shove it where the Sun doesn't Shine. =/"
4,"Sloppy research, but a great book!","What a wonderful book! The characters are very well done. I chose this book because I suffer from a chronic disease (and hope for a cure), but then I enjoyed Ilse's immigrant points of view, having met my US husband in Europe myself (I'm from Germany).However, I would have expected better research of Ilse's background: Ilse's mother gives her marks when Ilse leaves for Paris - but the currency of Austria used to be the Schilling, not the Deutsche Mark (now it's the Euro). When Ilse speaks German, it sounds like straight out of a dictionary - no grammar knowledge whatsoever. And so on and on...Byers knows how to write and does it very well, so maybe he just needs an assistant for the research part. Despite its shortcomings, I loved the book and will recommend it."
2,Thought there was more to it.,"The picture they showed with this was deceptive even if the intent wasn't there, I am sure they felt they had to show it on a belt that had a shoulder strap connecting to a belt, but when received and literately it came with no instructions, and only the sword holder, it was very disappointing. We will use it strapped to a belt my son has but definitely wasn't worth it. I will read much closer next time!"
1,"Misrepresentation: not Belkin, not 20 AWG","This is a Monoprice #5438 cable with a sticker put over the original label saying Belkin Gold Series. Monoprice is a Chinese brand that actually has a legitimate looking web site and even has specifications for cables. The spec's for this cable are 24 AWG for the power wires, not the 20 AWG specified in the Amazon listing. I purchased this specifically to get the heavier wire for my high current application, and the difference in voltage drop between 20 AWG and 24 AWG is a factor of 2.5, which at 500mA of current means the total voltage drop will be 150mV instead of 60mV. This is a misrepresentation by the seller, pure and simple. Belkin, L-com and perhaps others have cables with the heavier wires if that is important to you. For most applications it will probably work fine."
2,I've seen better,"This book does have some decent information, but it is impossible to find. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the structure of the book other than it starts with some useful information and continues on to less useful. There is little to no information about form validation, libraries or style. The few useful functions in this book are more easily found in a Real Reference book like the Javascript Bible"
4,A well qualified book at beginners level,"I started learning JS from three books, found this one with more clarity and precise explanations. Recommended for people who want to learn js in minimum time."
2,antenna performance indoors,"antenna was called indoor/outdoor- as an indoor antenna has not worked well reliably. It sometimes works, but rarely all day & almost never without changing antenna position to get another station. It is curently set up on a step ladder in my living room which is not viable permanently."
2,Not serious history; just buy it for the cover title,"When you see a claim that the Chinese landed on the US west coast, you can, with a bit of 'suspension of belief', read the argument. When the author claims the Chinese landed in Cuba, that's when it's time to return the book.Actually, what may have happened is that the author, who apparently is not a historian, mistook Chinese immigrant artifacts, which are found in San Francisco, CA and in Havana, Cuba, as evidence of pre-Columbus landings by the Chinese. Or he is playing with the audience.Not worth the money; and frankly an insult to the Chinese."
3,A Tower of Hypothesis After South Africa,"I read the book cover to cover including the Appendix.Very disappointed indeed after so much expectation built up.As a Chinese sailor myself and educated at both side ofworlds. I must say, right after the turning point ofThe Cape of Good Hope. Mr. Menzies made these Chinesemariners into a bunch of supermen. Of course I wish myancestors did achieve something major in the past, butI care about the truth more. That's what history is allabout.Nevertheless, reinforced by all the charts that Mr. Menzies'shows in the book, there is little doubt that peoplebefore Columbus, Magellan, Cook... had been there and donethat. I'd guess it's an accumulated efforts for a long periodof time by many many different people. Chinese, Indians,Arabs, Europeans... maybe all of them did.Well, if we could fish out an ancient junk in America water,that would shut me up good. Until then, Magellan finishedthe job and proved the world is round."
1,"""Facts""","This book is based on misconceived ideas and supported by ""facts"" that make no sense if you have any historical knowledge. No historian backs Menzies in this book or 1434."
2,Speculative,"High on speculation, medium on facts, this book should interest you if you like the era and topic. However, it is FAR from scientific and the author seems to attribute every anamolie ever found to the chinese: The vinlad map, the Bimini stones..list goes on and on. While I do not doubt the Chinese, Africans, Polynesians and arabs visited and traded with the America's for hundreds of years (thousands?), I do doubt some of the authors dubious claims."
1,worst book ever,"This is quite possibly the worst book ever written. A five year old could have written something that would have had more historical merit. Does he have to use the first person all the time? It really does get old after all it is his book with his own material, so he shouldn't always have to say I this or I that. We could logically assume that is how you feel Menzies without you saying I feel this way. Then there is the fact that Menzies gives us NO solid evidence that the Chinese have been to America. Where is the pottery like that found off the coasts of Africa and Australia? Where is any evidence whatsoever? Lastly if one is having a hard time comprehending the language on a map ask an etymologist not a crossword puzzle ""buff"""
2,A great lesson: how not to think critically,"The most fascinating thing about this book is its demonstration of how logical fallacies and self deception can allow someone to reach any conclusion they wish. The author consistently makes huge leaps of faith based on logical fallacy, conformation bias, selective thinking, and plain old lazy thinking. Each layer of wild conjecture becomes the foundation for the next, making this house of cards a great teaching tool--as a model of how NOT to think critically.Is Menzies hypothesis true? I have no idea, and this book certainly proves nothing either way."
4,Definitely Right About Columbus Not Discovering the New World,"As you will see from the reviews below, either folks believe 100% in the book or deny it completely. I am going to choose a middle ground. This book clearly and undeniably proves the existance of maps which show the new world BEFORE columbus got there. Now did the Chinese discover the new world? Did the fleets truly circumnavigate the globe? Much debate on that, even now a map may have been found from 1418 which at least throws Menzies dates in question, that Zheng He too either had a guide map or sent out ships before the visits Gavin mentions in 1421-1423.But one thing is clear, we shouldn't be celebrating Columbus Day in October in the US, we should celebrate at Most ""Discovers Day"" where the contributions of those before Columbus get acknowledged as well."
4,so chinatowns are older than we think,"a must for anyone interested in a more expanded view of the ancient world ""1434"" is to be read too..."
5,Something to Really Chew On,"The author explores the idea that before Columbus and the Vikings much of the world including the Americas had been explored and mapped by the Chinese. As this would turn all the prior thoughts of history topsy turvy, the author makes sure that he has support for all his theories.This is an extremely enjoyable read as you follow the author through his research and see the maps he uses as support for his thoughts and theories. By the end of the book, you will be wanting to learn more and you will be looking at history in a whole new light.A book well worth your time to read."
1,Spencer Wells's DNA studies dsprove Chinese settlement...,in the new world. In his book The Journey of Man Wells talks about DNA strains of Y-Chromosomes in Native Americans all throughout the Americas. None of them have Chinese Y Chromosomes. Menzies's application about Chinese settlers in the Americas over 500 years ago is wrong. And get a load of the obviously frigged up way he tries to make early 15th century Europe out to be twice as primitive as it really was.
3,Flawed But Fascinating,"Into the Night has some sustained sections of very good writing that immerses you in the Cornell Woolrich world of depair and evil. And for the most part Lawrence Block does an admirable job in filling in the missing sections of the book. Some of his passages truly fit seamlessly with Woolrich's.But the decision to attach a happy ending is unfortunate and very unsatisfying. Maybe Woolrich left the novel undone because he didn't have an ending, or he knew that a happy one would ring false. I don't think anybody knows.As it is the book's end simply undercuts all that came before, so it is hard for me to really recommend this book to anybody other than a Woolrich fan who wants to read everything by the author.You can find more book reviews by me by searching for ''goldenrulecomics'' on squidoo."
2,Disappointed in these...,"I received these poly mailers very quickly using Amazon Prime. They are very sturdy. However, like another buyer said, they are stuck together and you have to carefully pull them apart before using. This is very irritating and time consuming which is a problem when there are many packages to send out. I will be buying somewhere else next time."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed after receiving these shipping bags.I had ordered some in the past from the same company, and these were much less sturdy and tear very easily.Wish I hand't used some...or they'd be returned."
4,Canon LAH-DC20 Conversion Lens Adapter and Hood,Works fine except the Hood will clip the corners if a filter is in place and the lens is set at wide angle.
3,Sakar version,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to instead buy the Sakar lens adapter for the Canon S2 from a local camera shop. It costs $13 and is made of silver-anodized aluminum, but otherwise works exactly the same as Canon's plastic adapter.If you use filters a lot, you may as well keep the adapter installed on your camera all the time. If you do that, the camera will no longer fit in the Canon or Tamarac camera bags that people usually recommend for the S2. A nice bag that fits the S2 with the adapter installed is the LowePro Rezo TLC 10 which has the perfect width and height for the S2 with the adapter. The bag's depth is about 1 inch bigger, giving you some space for extra batteries or lens filters."
3,Skip the lens hood,"I generally stick to purchasing OEM accessories, especially for cameras, as I find that they usually have the highest quality. However, I'm starting to rethink this after purchasing this product.The lens adapter itself is nicely constructed (although a bit shouty about it's brand and country of manufacture), going on solidly and with no issues. However, the hood has caused me nothing but trouble. The second it was screwed onto a Canon UV filter, mounted on the adapter, it loosened the glass, which now rattles around in the ring and annoying me to no end. I was careful not to tighten it too much, but it didn't matter. When I tried to screw it onto the lens adapter without the UV filter, it mis-threaded, despite my most careful efforts, and nearly had to break it to get it off again. Very disappointing, considering I haven't even taken one shot yet."
3,It is what it is,"+ its light+ made by Canon so it should be the best for the camera and image quality+ Must buy because of the S series terrible lens caps- its light- much cheaper alternatives- Must buy because of the S series terrible lens capsIt does turn a noticeable amount after being locked onto the camera but it does not shake or rock even when a lens is attached so it should never affect your photos, just your peace of mind. It is also just feels too light when you hold it or have the wide angle lens attached. Canon would have been wise to use a heavier material again just for peace of mind. For what it is, this adapter is twice the price it should be.The only reason I own it is that it was part of a set package that I got off Ebay."
3,Awkward but necessary,"The color is fine, especially with the new S3 camera. The adapter is fine, but the hood has a lip before the threads start and didn't screw into my Hoya filter that I attached to the adapter. I had to shave the lip down with a matte knife and then sanded with emery cloth into order to get it to engage the threads on the filter. So don't get a thin filter, or prepare for some carpentry work."
3,"""Beautifully written...a truly remarkable book.""","war separates Hanah from her parents in I think 1918,she moves in her aunt's crowded tenement in Boston. Hannah and her aunt struggleto protect Hannah's two young sisters,but whwn a deadly influenza epidemic strikes her family is torn apart even more.Guided by a girl with violet eyes,Hannah,who has also has come down with the dreaded flu,is driven from Boston to a caring old gentlemanin Vermont,where she remaines until sheis healthy.She is determined to reunite her family,but does she hae the strength? Awesome book.The best Hesse has written !!! :)"
3,Read this book,I read the book called A Time Of Angels by Karen Hesse. This is a historical fiction book.This book is about this girl named Hannah that gets separated from her parents and has to move to her Aunts house in West Boston. After she got there she started working in a store to help her Aunt with food & clothes.Weeks later she got the flu and got real sick. The flu had killed ten thousand people so far. After she gets her energy back. Tanta Rose and her went to try to get her family together. After month of hard work she got her family together.I didn't like this book because it was boring. It barley had any action. If you are boring and like boring things you should you should read this book.
2,Wha?,"My daughter came home from a book fair with this. I read it and was completely perplexed. I flipped back and forth several times to see if I had missed a page or if a page had been ripped out. I had to look up the series online to get a clear idea of what was going on.""Ahh... it's an adoption series...""Hence a beetle as Miss Spider's mother. And the wish- which one must assume was for a sibling?The art was so busy, it was hard to see that the beetle-orphan was cowering under a leaf with a snowman. There were big gaps in the plot which I guess was necessary in order to allow for a rhyme scheme. I imagine that it would be hard for a child to piece it all together on her own.That said, I'm sure it would work well in the context of the series, but it does not stand alone as a story.It's a rather vague poem with spazzy computer art."
5,The best Lucia,"I've heard pretty much all the great interpretations of this work on record. Callas is superb and a real favourite. However I heard a snippet of this recording a few years back...possibly from the fountain scene I can't remember and I was blown away. I finally got my hands on the complete recording and look it's absolutely wonderful...Rost is amazing and this is my favourite must-have recording of Lucia. Don't shilly-shally, just get!"
2,"boring, boring, boring from a good band","of the four ex albums i own, this is far and away the most boring and expendable. i saw them on this tour and the songs from this album were great, so i suspect that they recorded the thing before the songs had fully gelled. fortunately at their show, they had all their out-of-print discs for sale so i got to pick up ""scrabbling the locks,"" which is their best. ""starters alternators"" just might be their worst..."
1,5 Star reviews and it's not even released?????????,"Obviously bogus reviews. Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting. Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting. What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5? how bout tossing us all a bone?"
1,Just buy a two-line plug attachment,"The only thing this will do is allow you to use a phone and computer independently on the same phone line without switching cords. Does not allow use of phone and computer at same time, does not announce incoming calls."
3,works well...not a gerber replacement part,does what a flush lever is supposed to do. easy to install and works well in our gerber toilet although is not a gerber brand replacement part
3,Romanian Phrase Book Review,"this might be a good guide for visiting Romania as it gives good tips on how to get through customs, hotel, dining, etc. However, it does not really teach you in a systematic way how to speak Romanian. I am particularly interested in learning how to speak Romanian with my fiance'. This book gives you a lot of phrases, but if the one you want is not in there (and finding it could be a problem) it is difficult to put a grammatically correct phrase together on your own."
4,Human look at life and love under occupation,"Hany Abu-Assad has proven himself with this film, 'Ford Transit', and 'Paradise Now', to be oneof the most interesting and astute chroniclers of the Palestinian experience in Jerusalem.The plot is simple: A young Palestinian woman must decide whether to defy tradition andmarry her boyfriend that day, or leave forever with her father, and enter an arranged marriagein another land.The film sometimes meanders, but has some very powerful sequences, giving a strong sense ofthe realities of life under occupation, and some sweetly human comic moments showing theuniversality of humanity in all cultures. Very good lead performances all around."
3,How long can you beat a dead horse?,"Rana's Wedding moves at an excruciatingly slow pace, telling the story of a girl who chose to stay in Palestine and marry the man she loves. I guess the point was to show that love and happiness can be victorious over death and war. True the message is sweet but the movie/acting is too cold and slow telling a story that is over told about Palestinians and Israelis.I think that there are other smart and subjective movies that explore this topic much more richly."
1,This seller does not stand by item pictured,"Fine Art Store does not stand by item pictured.This seller will show a set of brushes (10) and instead mails to you one brush of #10 SIZE. By the time you pay shipping to and back and sellercharges 15 Percent restocking charge, the seller gets a Free brush from youand can ""sell"" it again! Because of my unsatisfactory purchase, Amazonadded a note to the sellers item: ""Please note, you are only purchasingone brush, not the set that is pictured"" Too late for me. I recommend notdealing with this seller. Also Amazon tends to side with seller instead oftheir customer..."
5,Movie Stars In The Making,"2001 boxed-set includes all three: book, VHS and DVD. Lavishly illustrated book with over 300 rare photos! One hour documentary with over 30 rare clips in both VHS videotape and DVD formats."
5,what an excellent book for childrens use,"I am a mother of three children and have historical questions thrown at me each week. After a long search I found Roy Strong's,excellently written The Story of Britian, it is easy to understand, no waffle, clear and concise, the perfect book for quick referance on history. It is the ideal starting point for any historical matter, from 55B.C. to the postscript beyond 1990. A valuable book for all households with children."
3,OK...,"Acting was good but I felt like watching an Indian version of Rambo or the likes. So not what I expected. Actions (not to the level of Holywood, of course)."
5,"I can't keep it ""in stock.""","The message of self-nurturing is clear in this book. Beattie allows us to make mistakes and get on with it, and she encourages us to look around at the learning opportunities afforded in every situation.Having given countless copies away to friends and strangers alike, I find I can't keep it ""in stock."""
4,Class Readings,I needed readings for my classes. I have found a lot of useful readings in this book. Enjoyable for home also.
3,"It's Ok, but it is not her best work - and I LOVE her work","Ms. Beattie's ""The Language of Letting Go"" and ""Codependent No More"" are EXCELLENT books... Spoiled me as to this one... It's Ok - if you want a very short feel-good thing every day... Her other books are deeper, and I like that better..."
4,"Good, but I've read better...","This is a good book for a great cause: getting and staying out of debt. However, after reading it, I liked Dave Ramsey's Money Makeover and Financial Peace University MUCH better - more thorough, great ideas, and fabulous examples of how a little money can grow w/ time - which this book, CM, is lacking."
1,No difference,"A friend of mine gave me one of these. He works at a computer store that sells them. They are kind of behind the scenes joke for them, just for stupid people with too much money. They love to sell them, as they make a lot more money than on the ($) generic cables. But when it comes right down to it, no performance increase over the generics."
1,NOT Phillippine Brand if ordered from Eauction!!!,"I ordered Philippine Brand dried mangoes from Eauction and they sent Royal brand dried mangoes instead. The photo and the brand and manufacturer list Philippine Brand. Only way down the page in the description does it actually mention ""Royal Brand"" mangoes from the Philippines. If I'd known these weren't the product being advertised, I'd never have paid $18 for the bag. The Philippine Brand dried mangoes are worth it. The Royal Brand mangoes are not.Buyer beware!!! This is a bait and switch.I can't speak to any dried mango products purchased through other sellers, only Eauction."
5,aqua oasis,took this cooler with us on a camping trip spent many hours in the river floating and it was great. will be buying more of this item.
3,Pretty cool but!,The Ice chest does not keep ice very long in the heat. I live in Texas and over the weekend used this thing and it kept the beer cold for maybe two to three hours then it was all melted and got warm. Not good if you live where its hot try something else. The drink holder is pretty cool though.
4,Mary Did You Know - Worth the Price of the CD Alone...,"The song ""Mary Did You Know"" is an absolutely wonderfularrangement. I would buy this CD for that song alone.Beautiful words, very warmly sung. Touching.I have plenty of Christmas CD's by different artistswith all the ""usual"" songs. This CD has many songsI don't have on my other CD's.I'm not excited over all the songs, but everything isdecent - with enough great material to make this CDone I wanted to have..."
1,Cant' review what I haven't received!,"Don't believe the ""usually ships in 1-3 weeks"" nonsense. I ordered this 3 months ago and.....NOTHING.So much for amazon's much-vaunted customer service."
5,Fecking brilliant!,"The series explores the antics of a trio of priests and their loyal if insane housekeeper stranded on Craggy Island (just of the coast of Ireland, ""where they dump the old glow in the dark""). When I first saw the trailers for it I thought it would not be that funny, but a friend convinced me to watch an episode. The blend of the surreal story-lines and tight scripts make it a comic masterwork. The box should include a warning that it may induce loss of bladder control."
2,"Don't waste you money, move on",This product gobbled up batteries and only lasted a couple of months then broke. Don't waste your money.
2,"Drive OK, but USB connector too short",Nothing wrong with the speed or durability of this drive. Amazing size considering it's capacity.But one fatal flaw is that the metal USB connector is too short. This is because there's a non-removable plastic collar on the base of the connector that prevents you from inserting the drive fully into many USB slots.I bought one for my business's Helpdesk and we've tried it on several Dell PCs and laptops and it only works in 'some' rear panel USB slots. This is because many slots on laptops and the front of PCs are recessed and the Kanguru simply won't seat fully. Kanguru needs to fix this.
3,A basic look at aDrum Solo,"This DVD is realy for the beginner dancer as its very basic and doesnt step away from the set drum solo they are playing.As a bonus there is a clip of both Issam & Sonia in Cairo, buying drums, having lessons and looking at costumes, which for my money was the best of the DVD!!"
5,Carl Weber is great...,This was the first of MANY weber reads. This is a good read and good book. If you have not had the chance to check him out. Please do. You will not disappointed.
5,I Wish There Was a Sequel,I have read four Carl Weber books and each have been oustanding. This one was no expection. This book had a lot of funny moments and it also had a lot of serious moments. I would love for a sequel to comee out. I bet it would be great. This is a must read book.
2,Body wash only,"I use the Philosophy 3-in-1 WITH CONDITIONER. It works great and keeps my hair luscious. The one time I accidentally bought a 3-in-1 that didn't have conditioner in it, my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends. After only three applications I had to throw the bottle out. I lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair. I don't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality, but they do.This is one of their better scents, however. I would recommend using this as a body wash only."
2,"This smells good on first whiff, then smells disgusting.","I tried this out at my sister's house before buying any. When smelling it out of the top of the bottle, I thought it smelled great. But once you get it into a lather, it smells like a lemon cleaner--terrible. Also, I would not recommend using it as a shampoo--left my hair greasy and tangled. Doesn't foam under water like the Cinnamon Buns either, so its not really good for a bubble bath. Skip this one, and get the Vanilla Birthday Cake or Cinnamon Buns 3 in 1 instead."
1,Disappointing game,"Perhaps my children are too used to Playstation and Gameboy, so that the Pixter didn't really appeal, but this was a major waste of money! I bought two Pixters for my 8 and 4 year old sons, hoping they would keep them occupied during a long flight from Texas to Manchester (U.K.) but other than the first few days of opening the Pixters, I don't think they even turned them on again, and the games now languish in their bedrooms, untouched. I will be turning them into Goodwill shortly, or to a children's charity so that some other child may enjoy them. So, unless your children have been denied the *wonders* of other electronic games, I wouldn't bother with a Pixter. My sons told me that they ""didn't do anything"", which is rather sad that they expect a game to ""do"" things, but that's the price of modern technology perhaps. :("
1,I wish I could give this zero stars!,I was so excited to have a blanket for the winter and even though parents told me not to because it used up electricity I went and did it anyway. Well they were wrong. It used hardly any electricity at all ... because it broke after TWO days! I couldn't believe it. It started blinking on me the second night and found out that meant it was defective. I was so upset. Luckily Walmart gave me full credit. DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET! YOU WILL REGRET IT.
4,Nice Slippers!!!,"A little high in price i'm very curious to see how they hold up.They seem to breath enough were my feet don't sweat ,which is worth 4 stars alone.However they are made in china so too high a of a price for these slippers. The sole is thick enough to withstand slush and snow of a store parking lot and can be worn as shoes. They also fit snug enough for outside wearing. I would give five stars but china and expensive just don't go together IMO!!! My fault for not investigating where they were made."
1,Very Poor Construction,I bought these slippers for my husband the end of October 2012 and in 2 1/2 months they are totally worn out. The sole on the right foot cracked and split and the seams along the top part of the foot on both both feet have broken away from the sole! I am very disappointed as I thought these sheepskin slippers would be durable. I would never recommend this brand again!
5,SO COMFY,These slippers feel like slipping your feet into a warm blanket. The rubber sole makes them sturdy enough to wear outside. Now I can take out the garbage or pick up the mail without having to change slippers.
3,Great but bottom wears quickly,"I bought these Nov 20,2011 and heels worn out on Feb 21,2012 (90days)These are worn in the house(carpet) 98% of time maybe I just got a bad pair I will reorder again and try/"
5,Wow - why doesn't the radio play it?,"The first time I listened to this album I thought this was a greatest hits collection from one of those unknown gems, that only your really cool friends know about. Come to find out just the first major release of Damnations TX? Can't wait for the next one."
5,I Don't give out 5 Stars Often,"Great songs. Great voices. Great playing. Like a fine record should, it gets better every time you play it."
1,rubbish and nonsense - kindergarten level history,give me a break! A simple-minded rehash of many books that went before. nothing new. and purple and rather poorly written
4,Great shoe.,Worth every penny. Name brand says it all. I use it on a weekly basis playing in all types of weather and seasons. It's tough yet comfortable.Highly recommend it.
1,An utter waste of paper.,"Any book written by ""Bishop"" Spong should be rated a zero. The Midrash approach was used by all the ancient Fathers of the Church in interpreting the Old Testament and the Divine Plan. However, they knew more than anything that if Jesus was not raised, their faith was in vain. This is the typical trash derived from the Western scholastic tradition that wants to lead people astray from God's mystery, power, and majesty. All things are possible with God - even the resurrection of His Son. Why has the Episcopal Church not defrocked this false teacher, but allows him to perform the Sacred Mysteries while renouncing the Lord? Can someone please answer this question?"
4,love the camera but had problems,"Let me first say that I love ths camera to pieces and I mostly get really good results.BUT I had to send it back and get a new one twice until I got one that worked. First, the wheel would only turn in the wrong direction thus not forwarding the film, and the second time the release button could not be pushed at all.To get good results, always use the flash when in doubt. Use a film with high ISO. 400 is good. Don't waste your money on expensive ""lomo"" films and instead buy the cheap film from drug stores.Expired films will often bring out a cool new effect, if you're into that.Be sure to check out the submarine case for near- or underwater use."
4,Fish Eye Camera,"Great camera. The only thing I don't like about it is that the usually really cool fisheye viewfinder gets cumbersome when taking the camera in and out of my camera bag. Also, the lens cap is a good idea in theory, but it comes off all the time i.e. inside a camera bag, leaving your lens exposed to potential dirt and scratches. The design is nice and it shoots like dream. Light too."
4,Tunnel Vision,"The lomographic camera is really cool for taking specialty pictures. We received it right before our trip to Hawaii and came back with a lot of unique pictures.In order for the effect of the ""fish eye"" lens to work properly, you must be EXTREMELY close to the object. Also, there's an effect where you can actually double expose the film to create a ""trailing"" effect on lights from cars or stars or people... This item is a fantastic tool for making photographic memories look like a work of art."
1,Waay overpriced!,"Monster Cable is well known for having way-overpriced products and this is absolutely NO exception. You can construct a kit like this for less than $50! All you need is any plain 10-Mbit hub and 5 patch cables. There is NO need for ""high-quality"" connectors that ""perform at 5 times the capacity of regular cat-5 wiring."" Computers are VERY good at detecting problems and fixing them, so this is simply way overkill."
3,Either incomprehensible or you've outgrown it,"Fine book for what it is, but this is just not the right technique for systematic trading because the models proposed are misspecified for the signal over the time series (as another reviewer pointed out, price time series do not conform to the conditions of electrical and telecommunications signals).Still, many of the skills needed to isolate real signals and deploy real strategies are built through exercising with these methods, so all is not lost if you wade through this, deploy something, and come back with knowledge but little cash.Who is the book not for: phynance-lite Excel-based users.Who is the book for? Do you use Matlab or Mathematica or Maple? Do you know what an Active X link is for data feeds? Do you look at the tick data of the currency and swaps market and see gold? Are you laughing at me because these questions are inefficient baby-level stuff? (Hint: you've outgrown this book)."
1,Waste of your time:,"This book really let me down. As a preschool teacher, I was looking for new and creative ideas. Although this book has many activities to choose from, they seem very basic. Unless allowing children to scribble, make play-dough, and fingerpaint is a new venture for you, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!Having children ages 3-6 carve sculptures from a bar of soap with sharp tools...no thanks!!!"
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"God, these projects are so mundane! One craft is to actually cut out someone shoe insole into a shape....yuck.....wad a ball of foil up, step on it and glue it to a piece of paper..... are you kidding me?If you have looked at as many preschool craft books as I have, they start to look a lot alike but they each have at least one or two projects you have never seen before or a new slant on an old idea. Not this one.TRY THE LITTLE HANDS ART BOOK BY JUDY PRESS INSTEAD."
4,Lighted magnifying mirror,Already have one mirror identical but wanted this one for a second bathroom. It is exactly what I ordered. Great shipping time. Very happy with the item.
3,"Great if you aren't sure you'll like playing guitar, but...","I got this guitar because it was inexpensive and I didn't want to invest a lot of money on a new hobby I wasn't sure I would keep it up, however if you are looking for quality this is NOT the guitar for you. The particular problem I am having is that when I play the second fret on the 2 high strings it actually hits the third fret which is raised too high. overall I like it for learning but when I'm good enough to want to play for other people I will be getting a new guitar. Also, the bag and strap that come with it are super lame and I just threw them away."
1,Hewlett Packard ze 5604rs,"Needless to say, I do not see my NEW HP I just purchased on your amazon.com listings. I'm so angry at Radio Shack for selling this to me just before going on a Business Trip, & I'll be going there to expect them to return my money today. I truly feel I have bought a second hand computer. This is too slow and takes at least 10 tries before it will bring up the Desk Top, and then it claims there is no Task Panel. I do not even have WEB available on this, and after it freezes up, I want to throw it out the window! I'm not computer illiterate, as I own 3 others. I just wanted a new one! Thanks for letting me vent!"
1,HP Laptops Sucks -- Plsssss don't buy any of them..,"Plsssss don't buy any of the HP laptop. I have seen 5/6 cases in which HP Laptops have tons of issues. Even my own laptop ,i am going to throw it in dustbin. Few issues I have experienced are -- Battery doesn't work.- power supply doesn't work- some loose contact with mother board power supply- video drivers crash- cd rom drive doesn't worketc.. and many more..And above HP Support is worst !! they don't even lilsten to you if u r out of warranty unless you pay them !!Contact me if you need any more details.. but pls don't invest ur money in such useless product (Hp Laptops ..)"
5,"Good Value, specs as advertised.","You will be hard pressed to find a notebook with more features at this price point. When put next to my P4 1.8 that this is replacing, the Celeron 2.8 absolutely Smoked it!The screen is crystal clear and everything came as listed above.GREAT UNIT!"
4,Haunting,"A deeply troubled album, calling to the addict in us all. Television, a song as dark as its music video, and the lyrics twice as memorable."
5,Killer Trip hp and dark ambient music.,"Awesome CD. Every single song is wicked. Creative, dark, unusual, experimental.....a glorious acheivement. Easily one of the most underrated albums of the 1990's. Not even one song on this album is lame.....a five star record. Amazing! Well done Baxter team! For fans of Portishead, Collide, and Fever Ray."
4,Sony DCRTRV22,"Overall great comcorder. In All areas this camera is great, only thing that could have been better is the still pictures quality. This camcorder matches us against others that cost hundreds of dolars more and does well in compition against it higher priced betters. Its size and fact that it uses standard sony batteries (that we have already) was a great bonus."
5,Last reviewer doesn't know what he is talking about,"If you are listening to this album, the rhythm is not simple at all. As a matter of fact, most people will have a difficult time finding a steady rhythm at all if they are not familiar with Eastern music. There are no time signatures, it's a rhythmic cycle. So if you go in listening for a 4/4 or a more complex, like a 7/4, you are going to find it difficult to count, especially once the Tal comes back around to Sam, and they start to subdivide the beats within the rhythm. No idea what I'm talking about? Then don't buy the record. Unless you want a really cool challenging piece to listen to or like the last reviewer said, just to chill to."
2,Slow read...and not as interesting as I hoped,It was very hard to get into this book. It was dry and I did not feel the story was told in a way that captivated the reader.
1,rchaupt,"I don't often write reviews, but I thought this book deserves one. Having read over 10 of the books from the American President Series, this is the weak link. I was skeptical by a book authored by Gary Hart, but I trusted the series since all the other books were solid works. Hart quotes Henry Ammon so much that you may as well read Ammon's book on James Monroe, published only 15 years prior to this. Hart also repeats himself often. Although this is a minor complaint, the chapters could use some subdivisions. Again, if you are looking for a good biography on James Monroe, you'll probably want to read Henry Ammon's version."
5,Perfect!,"Worked just as said, extra long extension and very easy to loosen/tighten. Wish all adapters came like this one! Thanks!"
2,Ghosting,I purchased this to use with my Xbox 360 and I had quite a bit of ghosting in texts. It also made a lot of areas blurry where they're usually sharp.
1,Better than a Biddeford...which isn't saying much,"Only lasted for about a month. Not worth the money you pay for it, but better than any Biddeford brand electric blanket."
1,Don't waste your money on Sunbeam...,"Today, I am looking for a new warming blanket AGAIN. Each year the one from the year before no longer warms---at all. I go shopping, but all I find locally is Sunbeam brand, so because I never thought of looking on Amazon.com, I buy it only to be disappointed again. $80 is a lot to spend on a blanket that works only for the better part of one year--IF I'm lucky. I do NOT wash them nor do I misuse the blanket. Frankly, they just don't last.I changed the bedding today from Spring/summer light to fall/winter colors and tried two Sunbeam blankets I had in storage--just in case. Neither worked, so I threw out two perfectly good (Except they don't get warm) blankets and the cords. This is not the first time I've done this--it's become pretty much a fall ritual.We are getting cooler nights even here in So Cal so I put the twin warming blanket on which I bought for travel on the queen bed until I can find a reliable brand."
3,Real cheap,These were real cheap. Some did not have air hole on top. Used drywall screw to add one. This worked.
4,PC on TV,"This product is one of the best I've ever used before. It gives a sharp, crisp quality that looks just as good as dvd. It is better than some of the other pc to tv cables i've used. I would recommend this to anyone who would rather put their computer's visuals on a big tv rather than a smaller more expensive moniter."
5,This a must read book for young generation of higher learning society,What a beautiful glimpse of moments in life of the finest minds in our modern history. Their endless and selfless efforts to make unprecedented contributions for the advancement of the quality of human life are mostly invaluable
5,Intimate lyrics,"With all the deserved hype Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" recieved in '98, a small album like this went unoticed. A beautiful, fluid CD...from the timid-then strong vocals of the first track to the sensual ""Chocolate."" If you liked Madonna's ""ROL"" or Natalie Imbruglia's ""Left of the Middle"" and you just want a little CD to enjoy...I recommend this one."
5,meritorious echocardiography text.,"This outstanding work on paediatric echocardiography is a reference book. It exhaustively deals with embryology and correlates them to congenital heart diseases. This information makes the task of cardiologists easier enabling him to seek the abnormality,and their associated defects. paediatric echocardiography is often likened to looking for a black cat in a dark room. This text, I believe throws an illumination on the elusive cat. it also deals with all congenital diseases in great details along with comments on surgical aspects and their aftermath as seen on echocardiography. Truly this book has great merits for all echo-cardiologists."
3,This is an extremely violent animated film.,"This is the most brutally violent animated feature I have ever seen. If violence is your thing, go for it. But otherwise steer clear of this one. At times, it was confusing and hard to follow. But the fighting scenes and carnage make up for it... well, almost. Another word of warning: this can get pretty nasty at times. Unless you want to see that, stay away."
4,Post-apocalyptic gore-fest,"""You are already dead"" A phrase uttered by the main star Kenshiro, many a time, after performing one of his numerous killing techniques. The dialogue is a little cheesy , the bad-guys cookie-cutter,the animation primitive, but so what? This DVD is chock-full of violence and cool martial arts. Definetely watch this series in order, to understand the back-story and why the hell Ken is tromping around wasting baddies.You get 7 episodes, very adequate compared to other companies. *cough*Funimation*cough. Audio in English and Japanese, with Subtitles. Let's be honest...you don't want to listen to this in english. The voice acting is really bad (read:Atrocious dialogue), and will make you run home crying. Stick to the Japanese track with subs, and you'll be fine.Extras are the same old Manga previews from the previous disc,kinda dissapointing. All in all, a great buy...dont miss it!"
5,Great Christmas Gift for my 2 little nephews,"I purchased this toy based on it's reviews as a Christmas present for my two nephews, age 2 and 4. They both LOVE it!!! My sister has emailed me several pictures over the past month of the kids playing on this toy and their friends also enjoying it. I honestly have not seen it in person yet as my sister lives in another state. But she swears the kids LOVE this and they certainly seem to be enjoying it. Wish they had this kind of toy when I was little. Looks like fun."
4,So far so good,"So far, this is looking like a good way to store DVDs in cases. Once assembled and the lid in place, they are fairly sturdy. The DVDs lay so the spines face up which means I can see the titles. The box sets I've tried fit fairly well (Simpsons, Dr Katz). I could see how the snaps might be a problem for some, but so far mine have stayed together, though only stacked 3 high. I'm about to order a bunch more to convert the rest of my collection. I'm sure you'll hear about it if they don't work out."
3,It is OK,"Nice....but not worth the extreme premium price, really. I will go to Radio Shack next time"
5,2nd Best Soundtrack,This is my 2nd Favorite All Time Movie Soundtrack. Grease is my favorite - see any connections between the two?
5,Brings back memories!,"I loved this movie at age 8, and I love the soundtrack at 38! The digital download sounds great through my ear buds."
3,Purchased for my grandson,I purchased this book for my grandson and was not overly impressed I don't think it delivered the message all the way.
4,Lovely book,"I was pleasantly surprised to find out this is the book used on a Simply Quilts episode, which I had wanted to buy anyway. A good, fast strip method for making Trip Around the World, Blooming Nine Patch, and other patterns. Lovely photos, definitely worth a buy."
3,Good Patterns but Dated,"I ordered this book because I wanted to make a blooming nine patch for my cousin's wedding. When I received it, I was really disapointed as I was flipping through the book because it seemed so dated. I'm in the middle of making the quilt now, and I will say that the instructions so far have been clear. The blooming nine patch in the quilt doesn't look anything like a lot of the ones I've been seeing around the blog world, so showing a few varieties would be nice. If I was browsing in a quilt store, I would have passed right over this one."
1,snore,"what a slow, boring novel. One hundred pages slug by and nothing happens. The challange is to finish it."
1,Resin bottle only had a few drops in it.,"Took everything out of the package to repair a small < 1"" star. Cut the tip off the resin tube and squeezed pretty much NOTHING into the filler base. Went ahead and did all the steps just for the heck of it, and yup... Nothing happened except wasting time."
3,I don't love it...,"It's okay, not great. Gets an A for strong suction but a D for ease of use. Getting the extension tube out for the attachments is a struggle every time and getting it go back in it's tube is worse. I thought it would get easier with practice but we've had it for a couple of months now and still have this same difficulty. I'm going to pay to get the Kenmore repaired because my son (11) and husband can make it work. With this Dyson, I always have to help them with the extension tube."
1,Filter set for Nikon Coolpix 8800 kit,"After receiving this kit, I was totally disappointed. The directions for it's use were next to useless, and the product itself has no value. The housing provided to hold the filter completely shouds the lens of the camera to dramatically reduce any light available to the lens. If one is required to remove the outer lens ring, why not just attach the filter to that ring, instead of that rediculous housing.Frankly, the items is practically useless. It was a waste of time and money, and will promptly go on the shelf for disposal in the round file."
3,Broke On A Set Of Car Calipers,"I'm a mechanic and do brake jobs fairly regularly. I was looking for something quicker than my old hand screw in caliper reseter and this did the job... for precisely three sets of brakes.I used them on a small car (Chevy Aveo) and squeezed the handle with medium pressure and the metal collar in the middle snapped, rendering the tool utterly useless. The metal looks like a bunch of aluminum dust compressed together, much like particle board. It wasn't even a frozen caliper because the piston went back with my old hand screw tool. It worked fine but I suggest you only use it gently. If you have any sign of resistance just grab a C clamp or something."
2,One or the other,"This headset is advertised as being able to listen to music and standby on bluetooth at the same time and it does - sort of.The head set sounds great when connected only to the stereo streamer, but if you connect to both the bluetooth phone (on standby) and listen to the stereo - the music quality really stinks!"
1,Annoying,"I've had these for years now, but I use a pair of $29 Sony's. The Blue Ant requires too many wires. The battery dies an hour before my shift is over, and takes hours and hours to charge. Then when recharged you get to start the complex (you'd better have your manual) process of synching all the gadgets. My cheap sony has one wire. This 'wireless' headphone has a USB, a broadcasting device, and the charging system, and weak batteries. Blah."
5,blue ant x5 is great....,this stereo headset is great.. i listen to music all the time now and using the skip button makes it so easy to change songs...
2,NO SUPPORT,"The product itself is good and works relatively well. It does all it promises with the exception of the battery performance. The battery has a short cycle and also a relatively short life cycle. This would not be a significant problem except that the company does not support the product. They will not send or even discuss replacement parts -- including batteries. There is no where else to buy batteries as they are special made for the X5 only - simply not available! When I spoke to the product support technician I was quickly told they do not support this product in any way - no tech support, advice or parts and have no intention of ever doing so in the future. They cannot -- or will not tell you where replacement batteries of parts may be acquired and keep telling you it is not in the current product line and therefore not supported."
4,Tricky at First,"Figuring out how to sync it up was tricky at first, but the mfr. customer support helped me through it. Then I was getting a TON of static, but the way around that was to keep the bluetooth piece plugged in to a power source. I didn't want to spend too much on something personal I'd keep at the office to listen to talk radio, and this all-in-one device really fit the bill. It's not perfect, but it does exactly what I need it to so I really can't complain."
1,No to BluAnt X5,"though I tried, and even got my son to set it up, I can't keep it working. then the batteries died and I didn't even get 5 hours out of it."
2,Call to ensure your phone is compatible,This device does not work at all with a LG VX9800. There are different blue tooth protocols out there. This one uses A2DP. I would call the manufacturer of your cell phone and verify that their phones will synch with devices on this protocol before you purchase these head phones. They do work very well with the transmitter that comes with the kit. I have used these headphone with great success as wireless IPOD head phones.
1,Stopped working,We have two of these phones. The 1st stopped working after a week and I assumed my child ruined it in some way. So we bought a second and it stopped working the same day we bought it. She still plays with them however it no longer makes noise. Very disappointing!I would like to add we have the parents phone that is not fancy colors it only came in a solid metal looking color and it has lasted three years. I don't know what the difference is if any. Maybe we just got lucky with the plain one.Don't waste your money on the fancy colors. If you want a phone that lasts get the John Deere phone & keys set. It lasts making it worth the money!
1,Piece of junk!!,"This ""film,"" if you can even call it that, was so poorly shot, edited, sound boarded, and produced, that it almost entirely eclipsed the fact that they completely short-changed what could have been a fantastic premise. The subject of the commodification of female-on-female intimacy is a broad and fascinating one, which this piece of bunk completely failed to represent. Were I one of the few featured interviews of any value in this work, I would be embarrassed to have been included in the final product. A complete waste of 68 minutes. I wanted to watch a documentary about commodification, not an interview with a ninety-year-old radio show host, who by the way took the film so seriously that she proceeded to bake while delivering her theses!"
5,Exciting Adventures,Stanley C. Sargent takes the reader on thrill rides of adventure throughout this book with his command of language and his ability to make you feel as if you are a part of the story and not simply a reader. He knows what he is writing about which makes his stories authentic and believable.
3,fright night,"it""s a good scary movie, if you like medium horror. Not recommended for children under 13 or those easily upset."
1,"It's not an Uncut Unrated Restore Version, this MGM released is R-rated(Cut & Edited Version)","MGM studio released version(Sep-11th-07 released)is definitely not an Uncut Unrated Restore Version so dissatisfied to horror maniacs(fans). It's just R-rated(Cut & Edited)Version. IF you're collecting original uncut restore verion, try to find Uncut Unrated Restore Verion(88 minutes)in e-commerce website. It's surely exist... Most of horror fans prefer UNCUT UNRATED horror film! SCARECROWS(1988) A William Wesley Film.Scarecrows"
3,"More like ""Snatched""","Filmed more like the ""Blair Witch"". This is truly a backwoods film with it's fair share of dumb men, weed growing and smoking,crime,blood,and don""t forget the moonshine. Of course there are women,and chains. Rape happens on a regular. Oh, there is a small plot to this movie. Do not steal, because payback is a mean thing, is it's message,I think. But I know it goes deeper than that, then again...."
5,Review by Michael Hawkins - Historian and Writer,"How much did I like this novel? How's this? I took it along for two separate weddings, out of town, which I had eagerly been anticipating. My friends and family remarked amongst themselves that I was unusually and noticeably absent. I was in my hotel room reading Psychedelic Six! I especially enjoyed and appreciated the meticulous research, which stands out in this novel above so many others. As an avid life long reader of the war genre, I was surprised that the author was able to uncover new and fresh material. Mr. Spock has excellent descriptive skills, and he adds a nice touch in keeping music going in the background of the story. It is easy to imagine yourself walking behind Sergeant Sylvester ""Sly"" Wright as he plods through the Army bureaucratic, while fighting his emotions between his responsibilities as a Platoon Leader and the compassion he gains for the native people in a country against which he has been ordered to fight."
2,Kid's Italian,"It was not an appropriate choice for teens - maybe for small kids, but my teens seemed insulted."
1,Morrissey did WHAT again?,What Morrissey did was put out another weak release of songs from previous album in an attempt to get a little cash from these Morrissey fans who will buy absolutely anything he releases. He hasn't done anything worth wild since Your Arsenal. Everything sounds exactly the same and his music style is totally played out. This album is very boring and deserves less than 1 star. I'm surprised he didn't add Moon River to this album. Obviously there was no rhyme or reason for this album. The song selection is clueless to me? What is so rare about putting a song that was on his last album on this album? Please...Morrissey fans...GIVE IT UP. His music is awful now.
5,"Works as expected, can't change combo","I have one of these at work and it seems to work as expected. They include some adhesive hard plastic spacers that stick onto the end of the lock so that it is snug against your computer. I haven't had any problems using this on my MacBook Pro.Note that this unit has a factory set combo, you can't change it. TheTargus PA410Uallows you to change the combo, but according to the reviews seems to be plagued with changing the combo on its own. So if you can figure out a way to remember or write down the combo (I store it in an encrypted file on my computer) then this is probably the way to go if you want a combo lock."
1,CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK,I bought this item in a different length and all I can say is this is nothing but a piece of JUNK. It's so cheap (the materials and workmanship) that it fell apart when I opened it.
4,Well its a start.,"I was looking forward to the Drew Carey Show comming to DVD and when I saw this DVD on Amazon I grabed it. The DVD contains 6 episodes, The Pilot, Playing The Unified Field, We'll Remember Always - Evaluation Day, Drew Blows His Promotion, My Best Friends Wedding, DrugCo. Great episodes but I would rather have a complete season. There are no extras on this DVD. I guess this DVD is testing the Market before they release the full seasons. Anyway if your a Drew Carey Show fan then this DVD is good value. But I hope we dont have to wait for years for the complete seasons."
3,A good conceptual start,"The book is a good conceptual start for Java 1.1. It is also a good book on OOD. However, since no revision of the book is being done, it is losing value. In fact with passage of time, the usefulness of this book (or any other programming language book) is bound to depreciate.The concept of design patterns is not discussed in this book, which simply cannot be avoided in any book dealing with OOD (except such references as 'accessor' or 'mutator').Reference to a modeling language (preferably, UML) would appreciate the usefulness, which is my personal opinion.I wish a group of person take this book as an ongoing project and do the necessary things that would bring it to 6*!"
4,well written,If you saw any of the episodes on pps you will want the series. Jeff is my favorite charactor. Only draw-back they did not include enough outtakes which would have made it a 5 star
5,Coupling,"Loved this box set! Love the show. It's only on PBS on Sundays so it was a thrill to get to see all of them. Only bad part, is one ""season"" is only 6 or so episodes. Guess the BBC doesn't haev 17 shows in a season. So, the whole series is less than what you would think. But, it's still great!"
5,"Great dvd package, poor shipping","My husband and I really enjoy watching this series over and over. Just a bit unhappy with the shipping job from amazon. The item arrived in a box poorely closed and practically open for anyone to grab the content. Other than that, the dvd's inside where sealed and intact. Gotta use some tape next time."
4,one among the best british comedies,This is one collection worth having. I had seen a few of the episodes on BBC and liked them a lot. It's brilliant and hilarious. The cast was fantastic. The first three seasons were the best and deserve 5 stars. The fourth season deserves 3 stars with the departure of Jeff (Richard Coyle).
5,One of the Best shows on British tv,This show is built on greatness the first episode I have ever seen was the girl with two breasts. After that I was hooked I love the characters and hate the fact that Richared Coyle left the show I miss Jeff. Not a big fan of Olver Moriss It has nothing to do with the actor it just seems like they try to replace Jeff with a character that is the same but more toned down. Love the show want them to bring it back! Steven and Sue thank you for sharing some glimpses into your life. I love this series got me in to british televison when it was still new and fresh.
4,Not as pictured,"I think that functionally, this purse is great. However, the True Blue is not as pictured. It is monotone, like the black. It does not have the contrast stitching or logo. Which is unfortunate, because I think that look is cuter. However, that said, the purse is great because of all the ways it can be carried. I also like the size, because I do not tend to carry much in my bag, so it is not too big."
4,A good introduction,"This book was written for the Cultures of the Past series, and is intended for juvenile readers. For being so small (69 pages, including the glossary), it does succeed in giving an overview of its subject. The book covers the Persians from prehistory, through the conquest by the Arabs in 642. It also describes their culture, covering such things as architecture, food and clothing, religion, and much else.This book is not perfect; indeed, calling Salamis a Greek colony on the island of Cyprus is a glaring error. However, this book has many excellent pictures, and its layout does make it a very good introduction to the subject. Overall, I do recommend this book."
1,DON'T WASTES YOUR MONEY,"THIS BOOK HAS A SHORT DISCRIPTION ON THINGS LIKE CHAKRAS,ESP,CLAIRAUDIENCE,ETC. BUT THATS IT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TELL YOU HOW TO MANIFEST YOU PSYCHIC ABILITIES DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. THATS WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR AND WAS VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED. SO ONLY BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT SHORT DESCRIPTIONS ON THE SUBJECTS BUT DON'T BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO MANIFEST YOUR PSYCHIC ABILITES. IN FACT, DON'T BUY IT AT ALL. ALL OTHER PSYCHIC BOOKS TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE SUBJECTS IN THIS BOOK AND GIVE A BETTER DESCRIPTION ON THEM. THEY ALSO TELL YOU HOW TO MANIFEST THEM. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE THAT JUST GIVE IT AWAY TO SOMEBODY(LIKE ME). :)"
5,Great videos!,"These are the most enjoyable DVD's I own! The music is magical and Toni and Daryl are fantastic. The commentaries are so much fun, I laugh out loud right along with them. Definately worth the price. Will make a great gift for any age."
5,Old Shows!,This is a Very Funny and Great DVD Movies from the Captain and Tennille! The whole Family will love these!
3,Died - after 3 years,"Pros:Works fine. Looks nice. Has room for most cables. Colorful. Lasted a couple of years. When it died it didn't take my stuff with it.Cons:Burnt out and is now sitting in a bag. Monster wouldn't honor the warranty without a receipt.Be aware that the picture here is incorrect, this is the accurate picture:[...]"

1,"Quality is important, unfortunately, Monster is not Quality","One thing I read once and now believe...reserve about 10% of your home theatre budget for cables (If you are spending or plan on spending $5000.00 on TV, surround sound, speakers, etc, then plan on spending about $500.00 for cables.But, Monster cables are overpriced, pieces of junk. I've spent a lot of money on cables and used to get Monster cables. I've had numerous cables fall apart in my hands, had ones that introduced video and audio noise and were actually worse than the junk cables that come with a component.That coupled with the fact that Monster Cables is suing everyone on the planet that uses the name Monster in it (including Monster Garage, Monster.com, etc), I would stay far, far away from them!Invest your money on good cables, but not Monster."
1,Beautiful picture on the cover,"If it weren't for the beautiful picture on the cover, this book would certainly achieve a Rating no higher than Zero.And now for my review of the book:Whatever."
3,"Sinatra is the best, but this album is not his best","Sinatra is the last word in American song, but the music on It Might as Well be Swing is not up to The Voice. ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is a classic, but the country-ish ""I Can't Stop Lovin' You"" is awful. ""Wives and Lovers"" and ""The Good Life"" are also kind of weak -- was that Bert Bacharach?Sinatra had a wonderful voice in the 1960s, but check out September of My Years, Sinatra and Jobim, Sinatra Swings, and Ring-a-Ding-Ding for much better music. It was kind of sad to see how American music went to hell as the century progressed(and I'm just over 30...) FS was simply the best up to his (first) retirement, but some of the songs he included on albums are forgettable.As usual, Count Basie and the band do a great job on the music, but given what they had to start with you cannot fault them for this effort.Not a favorite, but a few nice tracks."
3,Hopefully Balto never really had a daughter...,"This movie was cheaply done, but it wasn't horrid. The music was alright (although I enjoy the French and Spanish versions A LOT more) and it gave a sort of a spiritual feeling. The script sounded like it was written poorly and quickly. I make my own storyboards; and good scripts are consuming and need a lot of proofing and time. I am guessing this was written quickly for fast release. The animation was horriable, to say the least. It was done quickly and no effort. It was shaky and a lot of frames were out of perportion. Jenna was animated horriably as well. If you are under 5 years of age, buy this,"
2,Balto II:Dodgified Quest,What a Dodgy video!it is so wierd and does NOT make sense ill tell you howBalto has a large family of puppies.all look like their mom apart from aleu who is only different because she is grey and howls alot.these features do not make her a wolf.She is soon a brattish teen who is leaping about in the forest showing off like a love struck goat!a hunter tries to shoot her but balto saves her.he tells her she is part wolf and Aleu goez ina huff and runs away!Geez Louise!She is crazy and says she doesnt know who she is!Balto goes to find her and has nightmares about being chased by a raven aND all these spirits come and help him find aleu.When Balto and Aleu meet all these wolfs turn up and an old wolf invites them to stay and says balto is the new leader .a handsome wolf what looks like steel off the first one goes crazy.(...)Well i guess its alright.
2,Pathetic!,"I really liked the original Balto but, this shouldn't even be called Balto. It is mostly about his ""Precious"" daughter Aleu.Right, this film is dumb because this old wolf says to balto ""You are not a wolf it is your daughter who is."" Eh? How? If balto is a half wolf Jenna is a husky how can Aleu be a wolf? She would only be a quarter of awolf if you think about it.This film has nothing to do with the first movie. You could'nt call it a sequel. Aleu is bratty and thick. ""Hey maybe that guy who's gonna blow my head off wants to adopt me"" Oh yeah!Also just cos a puppy howls a lot does NOT mean its a wolf. loads of dogs do that.Its so stupid with all these dodgy spirits flying around and Steele in his wolf form.Pitiful!!In fact its soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pathetic actually very funny!!But, really it is Insulting a hero to the animal world."
1,I mean common.,"Okay, this movie dumbstrucked me. We don't want our children learning alue's personality traits, such as screaming and yelling at her father and telling him 'I hate you' and running away. Oh, and religon lies with the parents telling them whats what. We dont need this alaskan totem who-ha. Mother sun sister moon brother wind. Stupid,Stupid STUPID! The ghost thing and the nightmares scared my daughter. She was so afraid she had to have me sit in the room til' she fell asleep. This movie is pure trash. No one adopts alue cause she 'looks' like a wolf. How realistic is a red husky anyway? lets have alue be the leader of a pack of wolves so she can lead the to a hunter and get them all killed thinking the man would adopt her. I advise you to keep away from this movie, and your children, unless you want to watch them to sleep, from being so afraid."
3,Not as good as the first,Same Balto- different voices. I dislike it when they change the actors who give life to the characters. Oh well... This struck me as a production done on a lower budget with the story line. This episode has longer than necessary drama scenes of Balto's dreams of who he is and it struck me as odd that the relational development with his daughter was introduced and exited abruptly toward the last 1/4 or the movie. It was good but did not measure up to the first one.
3,"Good sequel, but nothing like the first movie.","I enjoyed this movie and the characters, the plot itself was meaningful too. But the voice actors are all different in this film so that is what really threw me off. And the animation was terrible in some sequences. The music was decent, but sometimes did not flow with the film at all. All in all, it wasn't a bad sequel to Balto, and if the creators had worked a little harder like they did on the first, it could have turned into a masterpiece like the first. Kids will enjoy this film, especially if they are animal lovers, particularly canine fans."
5,Myocardial Infarction and Oxygen Multistep Therapy,"The chapter on myocardial infarction is not the one to miss!The reader will learn about the amount of time up to irreversible tissue damage from the moment infarction is triggered, determined in animal experiments. As this time window is very short, author concludes that usually only the patient himself can carry out the therapy to restrict the spread of the infarction mechanism in an acute case. One of such therapies, capable to interrupt the infarction by increasing microcirculation, perlingual use of the cardio glycoside g-strophanthin (ouabain), is discussed, and the experimentally verified proper procedure to administer the ""Strodival 6mg Spezial"" capsule is provided."
5,La union de dos culturas.,"Ante la union de los mercados internacionales, la globalización nos ha llevado a tener que conocer otros idiomas, además del materno. Es por esta razon que contar en el hogar y en el trabajo con un diccionario bilingue es de máxima utilidad. En este libro de bolsillo el lector evacua todas sus dudas y favorece el relacionamiento con clientes o empresas en de habla portuquesa. Para una ciudadana uruguaya, como es mi caso, es imprescindible contar con una herramienta tan útil como este diccionario, por el hecho de relacionarme constantemente con personas de Brasil."
2,Insignificant Contribution,"I have found that this dictionary is so scanty that I can be much more accurate by using an excellent Spanish-English or Portuguese English Dictionary and then using a second dictionary in the other language pair versus using this dictionary itself. Don't waste your money. Not only is it very small, the translations in it often are not well done."
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"Small images transfers-- 3x3 inches and such-- come out decently. However, larger pictures-- 1/2 page and greater-- come out poorly. The ink doesn't get transferred to the t-shirt, and there are white spotches throughout the transferred image. I can't tell if I ironed too much or too little (even after I followed the instructions to the letter) but if it's this delicate of a process, it's not worth my time. I'll wait until I find another brand that does the same thing without all the fuss."
1,2 weeks.... paid 9.46 for faster shipping... still got nothing!!!!,PAID $9.46 dollars for expedited shipping.... and its been 2 weeks and i got nothing... things that i had ordered a 9 days after i bought this itemthrough regular mail came quicker then this....
3,Women's Slave Narratives,"Being a peason that looks into Slave narratives,They were in some cases to short, an incomplete.Remember these are my feelings."
2,See My Review of Rebirtth of a Nation,"This was OK but as I wrote on Rebirth of a Nation, this book is an ersatz version of the yet to be published volumes in the Oxford History of the Unites States series."
4,Nine lives aren't enough,Nine lives worth of amazing contacts and circumstances and people all rolled into one man's life. The book was very readable and filled with the energy of Roy Sannella's life which seems to still have room for more. Getting to know Roy through his book was only part of the experience. I also got to know an entire generation of significant people from a behind the scenes view only open to those who lived it.
5,Awesome batteries,I have 8 year old Lenmar batteries that are still taking charges. On the other hand I've had energizers that went through the same use/abuse and crapped out on me ages ago. These batteries are great and the price is always right.
4,arm blaster - old school bodybuilding,"This is not the ""original"" arm blaster during the heydey of Joe Weider but it's close enough and it does the job."
3,got the one i wanted,"Bought it for 1 cut on the cd . The rest were okay.I'm still pleased , becauseFreestyle explosion was the only cd that i could find offereing this cut. The cd wasbrand new and the price was right. I have no complaints."
1,Not what they used to be,I love my last pair of Eastland loafers. These however are not the same quality. They only have half of an insole. The ball of the foot and toes are directly on the course leather. I had to buy insoles after spending almost sixty dollars. Very disappointing. We'll see how they hold up.
3,Very Casual...,Great for end of week dress down comfort at work. Not the best leather from Eastland but comfortable and reasonably priced. Go for it as a throw on with jeans or khakies!
5,You Feel so Sexy in this,"I love how this fits me I felt really sexy and my boyfriend loved the mesh seethrough of it it was perfect, it arrived super fast and in great conditions I order the 34 and the fit was great the stockings were just a tad to long but over all that was not a problem"
4,bra mini skirt w garters,The whole set is really cute. Its worth what you pay for because it comes with the whole set. I was very satisfied with the product. The delivery service was very quick. I received the shipment before the estimated arrival date.
1,Are you kidding me?,"Got three of these cheap racks - they wobbles within 1 week, broke after 2 months. Top heavy, tip-over easily. Just a total waste of money (ten each)."
4,need to be inspired? this is the book for you.,"i really enjoyed this book! so many different projects to check out! there are all sorts of ideas and creative tasks to complete. if you ever have a sort of ""block"" from creating, opening this book reassures the creator inside. it is a combination of art, poetry, drawing, photography, culinary and writing assignments (just a few to mention, heaps more inside) to keep your mind inspired. aside from all of the projects, along the edge of each paper are completely 'random acts' to inspire you. the book definitely ""inspires your next creative endeavor."""
1,You Don't Need This Book,"I wholeheartedly agree with the author's premise that projects will flex your creative muscles while giving you momentum and energy for more. I like the ""idea"" of this book and even the presentation, but the actual content and projects themselves are severely lacking.It must just be me since everyone else gave this book 5 stars, but I found most of the ""projects"" to be lame, pointless or no-brainers. Take, for instance ""PROJECT 4: THINK OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOK. Then, go to the library and seek out other books written by the same author."" Do any of us really need a book to tell us that if we like an author we might like other books written by the same author? And how is that creative at all???Honestly, there are only a few projects I would consider worthwhile in this book. The most valuable thing I learned while reading this is that I could probably challenge my creativity more by coming up with 52 of my OWN projects, and I think everyone else could probably do the same."
5,Great and fun ideas.,I love this book. I am going to send it to my friends and family after I have done many of the projects for them. Anytime I can connect with family and friends in a fun way I enjoy it. It is like being a kid but more advanced.I checked out [...] too and found more ideas there. Jeffrey Yamaguchi is a creative person. I look forward to more books.
4,an enthralling novel,"in need of a subject for a book report, i came across this book while searching through my school library. little did i know the depth this book possessed. the author, carolyn coman, has an amazing ability to create rich characters that are extremely realistic. berry's struggles and changing attitudes toward her life make for a very interesting read. the novel is almost depressing in a way. while berry has to learn to live with her tragedy, the reader does as well, and its very easy to dive deep into this novel. it's rather short, and probably could have been longer, but power isnt always judged by size."
2,overrated,Berry is one strange cookie. Self-absorbed is an understatement. Why is she so mean to her father? ...
3,Quick but not Light Read,"Many Stones by Carolyn Coman is a story about a teenage girl, Berry, who travels to South Africa with her estranged father to attend a memorial for her brutally slain sister. Just describing the plot makes for a long sentence yet somehow the book comes in at a slim 158 pages. This is my main criticism of the novel. It's hard to get into such a deep story about family tragedy so quickly. The reader kind of jumps right into the troubled lives of Berry and her family with little back story until a few chapters in.Short as it may be, the book stll has several touching moments and may very well be a welcome change for someone looking for a quick read but is tired of the fluff that usually entails."
5,Excellent for my computer,"I was having a problem with my computer coming on, I took it to the computer shop guy and he did not find anything wrong with it, I asked him what it could be. He told me maybe my electric was surgey in my house and it would affect my computer. I asked what should I get. He recommended a power strip by Monster. I searched up one I could afford for my needs and this one seemed to be the one for me. It has worked well for me so far! My computer is doing fine so far, also."
2,Doesn't do anything for me,"I bought one of these because I had a strange popping sound coming for my speakers every time somebody turned a light switch on or off in my house. I was told it was due to dirty power, so when I saw this thing I bought it right away. It doesn't do anything to solve my problem. The speakers are still popping, and when I measured the voltage through this device, it wasn't any more stable than without it. As far as I can tell, it did absolutely nothing. Its a pretty expensive power strip if the features don't work. I'm returning it today.That being said, it seems to be relatively well built."
2,Flimsy,The plastic case dents easily and the whole thing just feels cheap. This is not Compaq's finest hour.
2,Wish there was no dialogue with this...,"Russell Crowe is yummy, but what is up with his accent? This is a movie to be enjoyed with the sound off, because the dialogue is very painful to hear."
1,Disappointment,"Well I should have known...any movie with Salma Hayek usually I have not liked. I wanted to add this movie to my Russell Crowe collection and it was a mistake. I didn't think he could make a bad movie, but, this is it. He was fine in it...although I miss his Australian accent,but, the movie itself is just plain terrible. It was a waste of time to watch and I would give anything if I had not wasted my money too,but, we learn from our mistakes. This entire movie consist of these two people fighting, making love, fighting, making love, making up and then starting back over again only to finally figure out, HELLO, that it isn't going to work between them. I am sorry to say that this movie is a waste of time and money to watch, purchase, rent...whatever.It got on my nerves. I still like Russell Crowe alot. He is still a fantastic actor but this movie is a thorn in his side I think."
3,"Not a lot of story, but the scenery is great!","If you love either Salma Hayek or Russell Crowe, buy this film.It didn't win any awards, because it's a ""B"" movie, but I've paid for and watched a lot worse. Crowe and Hayek worked hard at being a couple in love and it's fun to watch. It's almost as if they were on opposing roller coasters, one at the top while the other was at the bottom."
1,Ummm...not Russ' best work,"I must say that I was truly dissapointed after watching this film. It almost made my cry to think Russell Crowe would even consider making this movie. He was excellent in it, but the story was not very good. It seemed as if they threw this movie together at the last minute and it was so boring. Who likes to watch a young couple scream at eachother all the time? Not me. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,What a waste,"I don't mean Salma, because she still hasn't proven she can act. I think she can, but honestly, we have yet to see it, and if she keeps making nonsensical movies where all she does is flaunt her bod, it ain't gonna happen. I mean Russell, who can do so much better than this drivel. And I mean me, who wasted 99 cents on the rental fee."
4,A Great Play About America,I actually worked on this play a few years ago and it is an incredibly powerful and moving story of America during the Great Depression. It begins just before the crash and takes the audience through the tough years of unemployment and poverty. The play concentrates on one family and follows them throughout the year also stopping to look at other people in other parts of the world who are all affected by this tragedy. It is a really good play and I highly reccomend reading it!
5,Flame of Recca,This book is so good that your eyes will bleed. My favorite character is Recca because he can put his arm on fire. His biggest rival is a mystirious women that tries realy hard to confuse Recca. Shes so desprate that she gives a thing to Reccas rival or friend and then she gets super wind abilitys and tries to kill Recca.
1,Poor Quality,"I had the HTS800 for less than a year when one day it just stopped working. There was no lightning storm, so it is a mystery why it happened. Anyway, Monster technical support arranged for an exchange and I received it quickly. However, the new one fails to work out of the box. I'm about to exchange this and am disappointed in their quality control -- You would think that they would at least plug it into an outlet to ensure the AC light turns on."
4,Perfect for my setup.,"Feels like a great power strip. Plugs fit snuggly into the sockets.Been on for a few days, still cool to touch.4 StarsColor on plugs are cool, but out dated names.VCR, DVD, CD, are 3 of the 5 colors. I have none of those as standalone components in my setup.."
2,THIS MODEL DOES NOT CLEAN OR FILTER POWER,"I had this model surge protector and it does not clean or filter power! Call monster cable and ask,you need the better models hts1000,mkII 3500,and better for power filtering or conditioning. Good quality surge protector,nice layout but not worth the extra cash, you can buy a just as good quality surge protector for around $25 bucks.DO NOT BE FOOLED OR FOOL YOURSELF INTO THINKING THIS SUREGE POTECTOR MAKES VIDEO OR AUDIO BETTER! I've seen other reviews thinking it did!"
4,Good for HDTV,"After using a surge protector from APC that also included coax protection, I turned to this unit hoping to improve the signal quality coming to my 42"" HDTV. I was quite surprised by the difference. For example, a couple of channels that were previously very poor due to a lousy incoming signal were cleaned up. I noticed no difference in the picture quality when connected straight into the wall versus when going through this unit and the included cable. The APC unit degraded the signal significantly.As far as the surge protection of the outlets, I don't think I've been zapped yet, so I can't vouch for the protection quality."
5,quality built,"top quality tools. disassembled my compaq cq60 easily with these. came on time. sturdy grip, used it to tighten some cupboard too."
4,A little piece of mind.,"I recently bought a new plasma tv and some home audio gear and wanted to protect my investment. This fits the bill perfectly and is reasonably priced. So far its seems to do the job, one lightning storm and no fried electronics!"
5,Tested it and going to buy it,"My friend has this product - Monster Cable MP AV800. I am starting my own home theater system. I borrowed the surge protector from him because I needed one with a longer cord.I need a decent surge protector and other Monster products were good so I'll end up buying this. The price is right. Hmmm, maybe I'll keep my friends and buy him a new one. :)Other things I liked is the three outlets that allow space for ac adapters. The color coded outlets are convenient if you tend to add and remove plugs when other items are on. I think the coaxial and phone line protection are nice features. I haven't used the free video and phone cable so I don't have any comments regarding that besides that its free."
5,Working great,"I use this for my home tv entertainment. It works well, and protect your asset. I refer people to buy it."
4,Good protection at a reasonable price,"This surge protector does what it is supposed to do. It is designed for TV/Home Theater use and has the proper outlets for that purpose. I detect no interference using the cable protection. I have used Monster surge protectors for all my electronic needs, and the reasonble price at Amazon makes that easier to do."
1,Be careful,"I purchased this product to use with a new Samsung 52 inch A650, a blue ray player, and satellite HDDVR. I plugged everything as instructed. Plugged the unit in and turned it on. Bottom line: there was a loud popping noise and a strong smell of something burning. I was afraid it ruined my new TV but was fortunate that it didn't. The smell was awful and the unit was ruined without even being used. One would think they would test these things before they sent them out.I sent it back to Amazon and purchased another brand. Seems this works for some, but is the risk worth it?"
4,Worked fine,"Always hard to tell how well these things work. When's the last time you had a power surge? Frankly, I never have for as long as I can remember. But then again, if I've got 3k worth of electronic gear connected to the wall at this point, I figured it'd be worth the cheap insurance. So far lightning hasn't hit our building, everything plugs into this thing good, and all the parts turn on when I tell them too. What else can I say?"
4,Good Protector,Protector serves it's purpose and is a bargain pricewise compared to the what the chain and local stores charge.
5,monster cable mp av 800 powercenter av 800 with surge protection,"product is by far the best thing i have ran across from monster cable. It holds up to its word when a dehumidifier comes on the tv doesnt have lines, when a hair dryer is in use it doesnt have lines. The list goes on. It is certainly one of the best monster cable investments i have made."
1,Pretty generic/not much creativity,"I've always loved the Care Bears, and wanted this album to get me in the holiday spirit, but it's lack of creativity and generic sound just made me sad. :("
5,Cute,"I received this as a gift for my son when he was born. Just like the other Ty beanie babies, it is soft and cuddly. It is just a small bear, perfect for a little baby. It is sturdy too. We've had to wash it numerous times and it has held up well. My son likes to suck on the pom pom now and it is still holding strong after a year and a half."
3,"When it works right, it's great","When this item works right, it is great, but I find it's preformance to be very inconsistent. I've even had it route me on to a bombing range via a road that has been closed to the public since World War II. There are several other issues that perplex me and although I really like it, when it does as it is supposed to do, it is quite expensive for a toy."
1,Horrible PDA - Okay GPS,"If you have Outlook 2000 or later, do NOT purchase this. It is NOT compatible at this time. It will NOT download/sync correctly. Only have 32 MB - 28 leftover for storage. Lots of problems with this model. Skip it. Wait until Garmin get their acts together. Horrible return/support policy. You pay top dollars and still get a horrible PDA. Don't know where those expert reviews get their units. Recommendation for a PDA/GPS PDA? Get a Pocket PC Phone Edition (next generation is due out) and then get the Bluetooth GPS unit with it. You not only get a GPS enabled (wireless - bluetooth/802.11b) PDA but also the phone. More importantly, with Pharos, you will get REAL TIME traffic information based on your current location (if you are in the 16th largest SMSA's). If you can't wait for the second generation due out soon, get the ATT pocket pc for $99 and get the wired GPS accessory for $200. You STILL get a better product."
2,"Very Tempermental, But When It Works, 5 Stars","iQue = PDA + GPS, which is a versatile, capable tool... when it is working. I have found the PDA/GPS combination to be fantastic. Garmin's approach to the iQue 3600's extreme sensitivity to static electricity, however, has been very poor. I have gone through 4 units since receiving this device as a gift. Exchanges with Garmin have been no-questions-asked, but it is a hassle, and I end up paying shipping one way each time, plus there is the hassle of re-installing via Garmin's draconian serial number system.Overall, I like this product, but if there is any chance that your unit may face one elctron of static electricity, consider carefully before buying this item."
2,GARMIN sells GARBAGE,"Each time I e-mail tech support, I have an entirely different problem. They are helpful, but you must wait two days for a response or call and be placed on hold forever. The battery doesn't hold the charge. Each time I even look at it, I have another problem. Save your money or wait until the item is better. Personally, I think I threw my money away. My little cheapy handheld palm is so much much better. I think I should have stayed with a paper map or AAA."
2,"*** STOP, DON""T BUY***","I have owned the Garmin Ique 3600 for over 4 years. I love it. As stated in one of the other reviews of this product it was the first Palm/GPS unit. Since then many other units have come out that are cheaper better. It is a great unit however it will not work with windows vista and even though you may not have vista now you will most likely end up using it in the future. This unit is discontinued because the newer products are just better. You are much better off just buying a regular palm and the garmin mobile 10. The price of the two of them combined are still cheaper then the 3600. Buy the way garmin's customer service is one of the best I have ever seen. In the 4 years I have owned this unit I sent it in about 8 times for repair (mostly all my fault washing machine exc.) and they replaced the unit all 8 times free of charge. All in all, the unit was great back in the day but times are changing and this unit is just not been able to keep up."
4,A Classic of Personality Theory,"Before he got involved in drugs and religious matters Leary was a respected Psychologist, and developed an elegant system for understanding personality. The book not only describes the eight octants of personality functioning, the system is based on a circumplex, so that descriptors that are on opposite sides of the circle are opposite in meaning (loving - hateful), but descriptors close to each other on the circle are similar (self-effacing and docile). Some personalities are adaptive, and others, more extreme versions, produce conflicted interpersonal relationships. He introduced a way to measure these personality factors and hence, a way to do research. The book provides findings of some of the early research done by Leary and some of his academic associates, particularly those at the Kaiser Foundation. Somebody permanently borrowed my copy out of my office in a hospital I worked at back in the 1970's, but I have forgotten little, it's that rich."
5,Excellent Resource Guide,"While this book is a bit pricey, it is worth it. Took me awhile before I bought it but a great reference book for my library."
2,some things are better left alone.,"One could not say this is a bad CD, but the only bright spot was ""The Sounds of Silence""."
1,yick!,"In the light of the failure of Simon's ""Caveman"", this seems to be pouring salt in the wound. None of the singers, particularly Lauren Kennedy, seemed to know what they were doing with this music. The choice of the singers was poor as far as style, and many of them were mediocre singers at best."
2,Doesn't Last,"Had one and after a few years it just quit working. Seems like not that big of a deal but I've never had any other power strip ever quit working. A ripoff at MSRP, maybe not too bad at amazon dicount rate."
4,Good product,This is just what I needed to protect my new TV and all the other components. I have been using it for at least 3 month and I can't complain.
2,"Won't turn off, switch broke","Have had this power strip for 22 months. We were going on an extended vacation so I went to turn the rocker switch off and it would not move. By turning the switch off it kills the power to all connected devices. I pushed very hard on the switch and now it moves but doesn't do anything, power on all the time. I can not recommend this as the parts used must be very cheap. A simple seldom used rocker switch should last more than 22 months."
1,Very difficult to learn from,This book was extremely difficult to follow. It fails to teach you the material necessary to solve the problems. The problems fail to develop at a reasonable pace and become fair too difficult much too quickly. The examples don't show enough variety to be of use in solving problems
1,help!!!,"This book is terrible. I was almost ready to throw it out of my dorm window on several occasions. First off, if you are new to thermodynamics, you will learn practically nothing. Concepts are sort of sprinkled all over the pages, with no coherent development and explanations. The problems are even worse. Most of them have no analogous example, some involve concepts not even presented in the book...assuming they are common knowledge, when in fact that could be the crucial step in solving a problem. In short, you will be lead through a maze and given false directions at every point. As if the authors present student with a challenge and see how well he/she can navigate this mess. Avoid this book at any cost. I haven't seen other ones on the subject, but I know this one is terrible. I'd give it -5 stars if I could."
1,Miserable Movie,If you are looking for something exciting that mixes the Civil War and Zombies then look elsewhere. Horribly filmed. Horribly acted. Just horrible. This movie will leave you feeling like you want ninety minutes of your life back. BE WARNED: STAY AWAY!!!!
4,Very pleased!,I am very pleased with this inexpensive coat rack/pole. It's a nice medium/light oak color. It was extremely easy to put together (10 min. with no tools needed). I really like the spiral design. This seems sturdy enough and is working just fine for our jackets and coats. Nice item for a nice price!
1,CHEAP,I have only had this for about a week and one of the legs broke on it - none repairable rather dissapointed.
4,Solid purchase,"I was in desperate need of somewhere to hang all my coats, especially with winter right around the corner, and decided on this coat rack. I love it so far! I'm a college kid living in a dorm room and this is perfect. No tools need for assembly and I haven't had any problems with it like some others. I might not pile the coats on, but for me and my roommate, this is perfect!"
3,"Decent, poor screws","For what you pay for it, it's decent. Do not use the provided screws. They are made of a very weak metal. One broke just screwing it in. We were able to fix with wood glue and drilling another screw. But for the price of $20~ makes a decent coat/hack rack."
1,Junk! 0 out of 3 work properly,"Monster is supposed to be one of those overpriced but very reliable brands, but here there was nothing reliable about the product. I bought three of these and all three work very badly. Sometimes the plugs yield power, other times they do not. I even have to switch devices from one plug to another in order to make it work. I would have been better off buying an even cheaper extension cord -- at least those have never failed me."
1,Unreliable,"I really liked the design of this product - from the color coded outlets to the unit's plug which was elegantly turned at an angle. But 14 months after I purchased it it stopped working. The light on the unit comes on, but it just stopped putting out power. I would definitely not recommend."
4,Worth the cost,"I did not rate this five stars because the flat male plug is on 45 degrees. That's fine if the electrical receptacle is left of where it is intended to be used but if the receptacle is to the right, cord will go off in the wrong direction till you can double it back. Also would be nice if it came in optional white or beige. The heavy black cord doesn't look good in our living room."
1,Inferior Specification,"This so-called protector can withstand merely 420 joules. Even a $2 power strip sold at a famous Swedish furniture store offers more protection (740 joules) than that. I see no reason why this product should be made at all, not to mention why it should be charged at such a high price."
5,Life changing,Stellar read. (if you can get past the horrific number of typos) The concepts in this book can change your paradigm quite drastically and much for the better. Like to understand what makes people who they are? Enjoy the idea of having the kind of knowledge that makes your life far easier where interpersonal relationships are concerned? Wanna know what makes folks tick? Get this book. Are you in sales? Human relations? Manage an office? Manage people at all? If you interact with humans ..ever.. Get this book.
5,need a new perspective for yourself or someone else?,"This book is a piece of art. I was recommended this book by a known changeworker, who's name will remain unknown. This book teaches you how flexible reality really is and shows you a practical way of actually changing your reality and others for the better. You can learn to Break toxic things you say to yourself and transform it to something good or simply stay relaxed when someone else seems to talk down to you, because you'll know that you can turn it around on him..but with this technology, you won't have to! It opens up a possibility to feel good and have control over the 'frame' which governs all communication and this and much more is covered in this book. A must have if you want to be a better person and feel better overall!"
4,Men know they are a trip!!!!,"Well this book was defitnely written by a man...the way Carl broke it down for women and how they stick together. While reading this book I was like these men know they were so wrong on all accounts that guy named Jay was OFF THE CHAIN, he know he was busy throught out the WHOLE book. The only character I kinda liked was Allen he was done so wrong but in the end he ended up being happy. I liked how it ended I was ok with it, normaally it ends dumb but it eneded knowing what happend to each person and how their marraiges turned out so I am good with it...so now I am on to So You Call Yourself a Man...happy reading."
5,loved it!,"i loved this book. it was a page turner from beginning to end. it's been a few years since i've read it, but if people ask me what's a good book to read, i tell them to make sure to read this one."
5,Kings of Drama!,"This is a must-read tale that will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I was extremely pleased with this book and how well it flowed. I hesitated to take a break while reading it, because I was dying to know the next dilemma this foursome would get into.Kyle, Wil, Allen and Jay are comrads for life; but, they all have some serious family/life issues. Kyle is involved in an interracial marriage, and certain events in his life have made him question the validity of the marriage. Wil is strictly a family man, but gets himself into trouble by not revealing the truth. Allen is a real nice-guy and lets his greedy girlfriend take advantage of him. Jay is a straight-up dog who has little respect for his wife or his friends, and his philandering escapades get him into a heap of trouble."
4,Crowd Paintings by Donald Baechler,"This book is fantastic and if you an admirer of Baechler's work, then buy this book. It has great images of rarely scene paintings. It's worth the wait if you order it."
3,"Interesting topic, the writing a bit confusing","I have been following Domain Specific Languages (DSL) and model-driven development for some time. Software Factories (SF) seem to be one of the first development process framework that leverages DSLs. What I have expected from this book is to describe the relationship between the two.The book does a very good job at describing the intentions behind DSLs (good job Steve and Stuart). The SF portion is less digestible. Often wordy, with long tedious lists of barely related facts. I feel the author wanted to cover as much of the field as possible. Still, I got lost several times in the details.The formatting of the book does not help either. Please, use numbered sections! Many times, I did not know if this is a detail of previous section, or a completely new one.Probably my major complaint is the missing link between the DSLs and SF. I just did not get it. Still, the book is very worth reading."
1,Who writes software like this?,"This explains the ""excellence"" of enterprise garbage such as ClearCase, ClearQuest, and etc. Run away from this nonsense and read something more modern, something that doesn't rob you of your desire to live. Software is supposed to be fun - these ruinous runes must be recycled into fluffy TP at the earliest opportunity."
4,classic yellowjackets music! Kurt Elling is great!,"I waited a with baited breath for this Yellowjackets CD. As a fan club member, I am something of a fanatic. As usual I was thrilled! But suprisingly, I was pleased by the instrumental selections. Kurt Elling and Jonathan Butler contributed excellently. Highly recommended!"
2,Not sticky enough,"Unfortunately, these sheets aren't very sticky. The print quality was great, but I have done nothing but fight over attempting to keep my labels on my product."
5,Flip Phone Case,"The shipment was on time, and I am happy with the product. The product was Exactly what I ordered, I would recommend this item."
4,works well,"I liked this product. It gives a close shave, and I like that I don't have to soap up before I use it, so if I find some strands in the mornings, I can grab this and take care of them in seconds. If you want long lasting, smoothest looking legs Neat is still the best, but this is definitely second best"
2,Barely makes the grade.,The Title says it all. It's a good electric razor only if you don't really need one.
3,Sony has finally responded!!!,"I have had the same problem with my DCR TRV33. I've called Sony previously and they said send it to the repair center but I had to pay for S&H; and repair. I thought I was SOL. I keep on checking though, hoping that Sony would see the error in their ways. And maybe from all the unhappy consumers or class action lawsuit, they responded FINALLY! I'm sending it in tomorrow. Wish me luck.[...]"
2,Pleased but disappointing,"I had mine for 2 years and it did most of the things I needed very well (low light filming is acceptable but not good). I could also use it to capture VHS tapes and get them into DVD format through my PC.Anyway, now after 2 years and probably 15 MiniDV tapes of filming (~20 hours of usage!) and the thing stopped working from one day to the next. Doesn't focus, has yellow tint, etc. I would expect more from a Sony and this was one of the better camcorders out there when I bought for $800+ bucks. Can't recommend it."
3,Very Loud Annoying Buzzing Noise,"I have just purchased a unit last March 28, 2003 but decided to return it back because of this very loud annoying buzzing noise that somewhat emanates I suspect from the motor that controls the VCR and CAMERA mode. I have gone to other stores and tried/tested other units of the same model and as well a model of this line that has less options and found that it too possesses the same problem as I may call it, ""Very Loud Annoying Buzzing Noise"". I love the features that this particular camcorder offers but decided otherwise because of this noise but if you decided to purchase one, please do try and post your findings around here. I hope Sony relizes and find a fix to this if indeed this is a problem because for me as a consumer it ""BUZZING SOUNDS"" surely is. I have an older Sony camcorder but this one is smooth and have no noise."
1,pass on this one,"I read Masque of Jade first, which is the sequel to this book, and I picked this one up because I wanted to finish the series. I regretted it. This book is not nearly as good as Masque of Jade by Emma Merritt. The hero and the heroine I could not stand. The heroine was this whiny little brat and the hero wasn't any better. I saw no love between them, just sex."
1,Lacks things that fly fisherman are looking for.,"This really is the Cosmo of Fly fishing magazines. There is little content that will actually help you out on the water, and the articles are fairly boring and uninteresting. When the ""Gear For The New Year"" article contains just three pieces of gear that are super expensive, I knew this was a yuppie publication. When the issue comes in, I spend a few minutes reviewing it, hoping that it will be better, then it usually ends up in the magazine bin with all of the other fodder. I paid 20.00 for the subscription, and I will not renew when it expires."
1,Read at your own risk,"I bought the book at a garage sale raising funds to fight breast cancer.I found it very well written. Although engaging, the first section was a bit more difficult to follow than I would like. In any case, I was sufficiently intrigued to continue.However, by about page 150, I had to put it down as it was feeding my feelings about christian hatred, arrogance, and bigotry. I could feel myself beginning to think I could accept the techniques used by the anti-choice against the anti-choice people.From that respect, it is a powerful read, but one I dare not finish; hence my negative review."
2,"Starts out intriguing, becomes a train wreck","When I read the synopsis of this novel I was captivated. The description made you believe that this would be a wild ride of sex, secrets and lies, with a twist of irony. The first few chapters were mesmerizing, but then it started to slow down to a drawn-out dead stop. I finally became so bored that I tossed it down about 2/3 of the way through. The characters are annoying and whiny self-absorbed creatures. I could not muster any sympathy for even a single one of them. My opinion: it's an absolute train wreck of a novel as a whole, although I did not finish it. Very rare that happens with me. Sorry that I purchased it, even from the discount bin. Left me wondering if all the positive reviews were from friends of the author."
3,No closure!,"Yes, Brundage did a super job for her first novel. Yes, she kept the pace going, and made me want to stay up all night. Yes, she created a fascinating, AND believeable character in Lydia Haas. she did all of this and more......Then she finished it off with an ending that seems hollow and incomplete. (Stop reading here to avoid some spoiler comments) The reader is left puzzled and unfulfilled as to the fate of the evil Reverend Tim, and his group of fanatics. He was left lying stunned on the floor near the end of the story.....and not a word further as to what was to become of him and his nasty little group. Was he arrested for attempted murder? What about the murder (suicide) of Mr. Sawyer? What became of the other nuts in the group?Am I the only one to feel this lack of closure? A potentially great first book, flawed by a poor ending...."
2,Be Ready to Suspend Your Sense of Reality,"There are many holes in the plot. A Harvard educated doctor does not go to the police and share all suspicions with them. A little girl goes missing at school after recess. No one notices? The parents and police are not informed? When the police are called to the house they will not take a report unless they can see the marks on the little girl? The last patient seen before a bomb explodes at an abortion clinic signs in as ""Jane Doe"" and she is not thoroughly investigated? When the doctor discovers that his daughter was abducted, he stops to steal a cat on the way home instead of speaking with the police? There are so many unbelievable circumstances in this story that is is difficult to concentrate on the finer points."
1,Do Not Buy This Book! it should be no stars,"I mistakenly picked up this book in what I thought was the ""christian"" section of my local Walmart. It was right next to it. This is totally a pro choice book written to make pro life people look like lunatics. I despised the book, the topics and the language all in the name of making money. Reasons in the book on having abortions was because women were not at a good time in their life. Killing babies is never right even in a fiction book. I thought by the back cover that the dr might regret what he did eventually. That never happened. This was a waste of money!!!"
4,Keep your eyes on this author,"I think that Elizabeth Brundage made a wonderful first attempt at literary fiction with The Doctors Wife. Very rarely can you find an author who can write about such unsavory subject matter as rape, kidnapping, attempted murder, adultery, child abuse, abortions, and mental illness and yet still have the ability to keep you wanting to turn the page to find out how the story is going to end. Kudos!!"
4,Interesting and full of suspense,"A great read, if you dont mind feeling a little depressed and sad. The characters are written so beautifully, that you cant help but feel what they feel. It is dark, it is gloomy, it is sad. Even the moments that should bring joy to the characters are tinged with the darkness of the overall story. Nonetheless, I appreciate a book that doesnt have the typical romance and happy ending, it felt real."
2,4 1/2 Stars? - Maybe 2!,"In my opinion this was not a well written book. Though I didn't hate it, I found it predictable, too long and the writing style at bit amateurish. I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends."
2,The Doctor's Complicated Life,"This story is a pseudo-mystery novel about a family living upstate New York. The doctor of the title is an obstetrician in a religiously affiliated hospital who begins preforming abortions at a recently opened neighborhood clinic. The doctor's wife is a journalist and a stay at home mom, who is trying to get back into her career. This novel can be seen as an interesting commentary about the violent ""pro-life"" movement in this country. The novel takes many unbelievable twists and turns, as the couple becomes involved in very intimate yet different ways with another local couple--one an artist and professor at a local university and the other, his wife, a deeply disturbed and beautiful woman.The story line is a little convoluted and hard to buy into. Not a bad book, just not the greatest either. Could be a great discussion book for the right book group, however."
5,it's epoxy you can't mess that up,works as described. used this epoxy to fix my antenna on my DELL mini laptop. tried super glue which broke after a few weeks
4,A good cheap Epoxy,"I bought this on the cheap because I needed to fix a small crystal lamp I purchased for my mom that the base had fallen off of. I knew about the name brands but I thought I'd keep it cheap and get this. Well, it worked a charm. I sanded down the wooden stand area a little and applied and firmly held it down for at least 5 minutes. The result was perfect and my mom never knew her lamp broke. I have kept the epoxy stored with the cap back on and it is still keeping it's liquid gooey form and is clear."
4,GREAT LISTEN and great songs!!!!,"The opening song, ""Ready to Live"" is fantastic; great lyrics and just such a warm feeling to it... inspiring. I LOVE this song!""Wings to Fly"" is a masterpiece and very touching.I like all of the songs on this CD but the first one is my favorite, followed by ""Wings to Fly.""Oh, I forgot!! ""Wish You WEre Here"" is my favorite song on this CD, how could I forget this song? Its one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life; I cried the first ?? times I heard it. So, so beautiful and hopeful.I love Mark Harris and am now looking into his 4HIM projects as I had not known he was a member of that group (had heard of the group but had none of their albums, etc).I am surprised more people have not rated this CD. Mark Harris is a very, very gifted songwriter and singer! This album deserved far more credit and acclaim that it received."
3,"works ok , with some problems",There were alot of bare spots were the paint had rubbed off from shippng . so first thing i repainted it to prevent rust . then during first use the right front wheel locked up . i tore apart to find that there was hardly any grease in the gear assembly from drive wheel to the brush driver so i greased all up . now everything is turning freely and seems to be working fine . the bag dumps easily from the tractor (dont need to get off) other than those two issue it seem like it works fine and will do the job .
3,It saves time for the most part,This item is not too difficult to put together. all parts were with it. You will have to drive pretty slow or go over the grass/leaves a couple of times to adequately pick up all the clippings. the bag needs be emptied fairly often because it fills up fast. overall good product but i'm going back to the auto push mower and using the bag on that which does a better job.
1,Bad Customer Service,"I installed this product as instructed by their directions. My computer fit all of the spec requirements. The product did not work. I re-installed the product a few times with the same results.Finally I called the Zonet customer service, waited on hold for 15 minutes and ultimately was directed to a voice mail where I left a message as instructed. I received no call back.So I e-mailed the customer service throught their website and received a reply days later that was a broken-english version of the same information given in the instruction manual. I e-mailed them again and asked for further clarification/service. This garnished no responce at all.I have since returned the item.This product may work fine for someone else, but if you buy this and have any issue in operating it, do not expect any customer service fromthe manufacture."
4,A good Tank,"I bought this tank and received it very fast. The packaging was good and there was no damage, the tank came in it's store bought box and was in good condition. It came on a baseplate and was held on by screws. Once I got it off I looked at it and concluded several things. One, it is very delicate as it is entirely made of plastic, also the hatch on the turret is held in by gravity. Two, the treads roll, but occasionally jam up. And three, the gun can't stay at a level position on it's own. Because it is so heavy it just slumps down on the hull of the tank. That's easily fixable but is annoying, if you plan on playing with it, it won't last too long and isn't that great. But if you plan on displaying it, it is perfect. *You can play with it but be careful*. So all in all it's pretty good with a few problems."
2,Disappointed,"I love the Night Court series and enjoyed the episodes on the DVD however, there was a three part episode of night court and only two parts were on the DVD. That was very frustrating. If I order season 1 I will get some of the same episodes I already own on the compilation."
1,Executives are not qualify to decide what the FAVORITES are,"I really wish that these people would quit trying to decide for the fans what the favorites are. Usually these people have a distorted view of what is funny and what is not.I want ALL the seasons of Night Court. Not just Season one and ""Favorites""."
1,This is SILLY!,"I want ALL seasons of Night Court! True, the first season was not the best, but the later seasons were extremely hilarious. If we buy this DVD, they will think that it is a great sell and then make more ""Best of Night Court"" DVDs. If we boycott this DVD, they will think that we don't like Night Court. What gives???"
2,Prefer seasons but....,"I must admit that the ones listed are not the ones I would pick as favorites. That is why it has only 2 stars. The episode with Dan saving Christine's life and asking for a payback price would have made my favorites list. I still feel that this show is one of the funniest shows ever on television.I can see from most of the reviews that people would prefer season sets. I too would like season sets as I really like the show. However I will take what I can get. From what I have seen on web sites, the company was disappointed with sales of season 1. If this compilation doesn't sell well then there may never be any more seasons. So don't boycott this DVD use sales of it to tell the company that we like Night Court and want the rest of the season sets."
1,Bypass this bad compilation and get the Season 1 DVD for just a few bucks more.,"There's a rumour that Warner will supposedly release the full uncut Season 2 if this poor excuse for a sitcom DVD sells well. To that, I say ""bullsh*t"". If Warner was planning on releasing Season 2, they would have done it already instead of putting out this compilation to test the waters. Warner's second-guessing is quite confusing to say the least; the Season 1 DVD sales prove we're rabid for more full Night Court seasons. And as for the content of this DVD, I must say the selection was careless and sloppy to say the least. What's the reason behind including the pilot when we already have it on the Season 1 DVD? Why are parts 3 and 4 of 'Her Honor' omitted? Who the hell was in charge of compiling this DVD? Heck, even the DVD cover art bad; it's just another generic cast publicity shot we've seen a million times."
1,Rip-off! Give us Season Two!!,"This is ridiculous! I've been looking forward to season 2 for months now. What a huge disappointment. If the second season really IS planned for a future release, then what the heck is this?? Save your money."
1,Travesty!,"I am a long time night-court fan. Unfortunately I started watching a few seasons in, so season one was really enjoyable for me as I hadn't seen these episodes. As people have quite rightly pointed out, the early seasons weren't the best, but in my opinion were still good.I am not going to buy this DVD! Warner Brothers get your'e act together and release the lot not just some half-baked compilations of what you think are the best episodes."
4,A good book,"This was a good book, but about the slowest one in the series. Other than Lavina and Brad, there aren't any real social problems for Sammy. There usually is. Like she and Tor have a big fight, or Yvonne has boyfriend troubles. One of Brad and Lavina's books that puts the spotlight on them and they're dirty, SLIPPERY, deeds."
2,Not my style!,"I found it too flowery. I went over enthusiastic and ordered 4 bottles, now i have to return all of them."
4,good swing,"Ok--this is the only swing we've owned so I can't really compare it to others but my baby loves it AND we got it used for $30 so this review might be different if I paid full price for it.I love that we we were able to recline it when he was younger and now that he's 6 months, we can bring it back to an upright position so he can play with the min maestro. My only complaint is that we can't turn the music down lower (the lullabies are softer but the other setting is sooo loud, even on the lowest position). Like another reviewer said, it does eats through batteries. The whirring of the motor is kind of nice actually--it's kind of rhythmic and acts like white noise for him.I also like that we can lock the swing and take off the music tray and be left with the plain tray for feeding. It's nice that you don't have to bend down too far to put baby in/out. Great versatility. I'd definitely recommend it to other parents."
1,No interest,My dog doesn't use them and has no interest. She's a 3 month old boxer teething and prefer's chewing on the plastic handle of the cat's brush.
3,Read only the table of contents,"The aim of this book, as stated by the back cover, is very admirable: ""This volume provides an illuminating overview of the classical mathematics of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries. ... Motivation, especially the original motivation, is a prime concern and so is clarity and, consequently, proofs and discussions are in terms of modern concepts and ideas."" Indeed, the selection of topics is very nice; the table of contents is well worth meditating on. But other than that this book has little new to offer. In particular, one does not see much of the alleged concern with motivation. In effect, each chapter opens with a few standard historical remarks--something like ""Euler proved A, then Gauss proved B, but then Riemann proved C""--and then follows a standard textbook treatment of these theorems. Also, the typesetting is poor."
3,Average,This book was informative in regards to Shannon's awards and achievments. However it would have made a much better read if we got to know both Shannon and her family on a more personal level.
5,A pretty good book,"For those of you that can't get a hold of the other Shannon Miller biography, this book is a good substitute.Written by Shannon's mother, I found it to give a very informative and interesting look into Shannon's life before and after Barcelona and Atlanta. This book tells you how she coped with her injures, about her training, and her relationship with Steve Nunno.Of course, since Shannon's mother wrote it you get a little one-sided view, because after all, in her mother's eyes Shannon can do nothing wrong. But Shannon's mother tried very hard to be accurate, and overall I was left with a very good impression.Before I read this I didn't really like Shannon Miller as much as some of the other gymnasts, and I'm not sure why. But after I read this book, it gave me a new understanding of all the hard work Shannon had to put in to become America's favorite gymnast."
2,Prenuptial Agreements,Received the book on time but the CD didn't work no matter what I did to get it to work. I won't order from this company again!
4,why this book was ok,This book rox'd except for the fact that it was only 100 pages and streched out into another book it isn't cool u get hocked for the next book so u buy the next book 2 books 100 pages each = 10.00 for a 200 pg book. not cool @ all
4,GOOD OVERALL 7.75 OUT OF 10,"Whether you want to believe it or not, there were some decent licensed games that came out before the time of games like Golden Eye 007 for N64. This is one of the very small handful of licensed games that turned out decent before 007. This game actually has good platforming and it's not worthless unlike many of the usual licensed products. The challenges are pretty fun and trying to locate jewels to increase your points along with health packs is actually not a hassle and it isn't repetitive. There are a couple issues however. First off the game is a bit too easy(I've beaten it 13 times), and second, the camera can be a bit squirrelly. Overall, I'd give Capcom props for churning out one of the first good licensed games and it has a high replay value so it never really gets old to play, and it's easy to pick up and play."
3,Incomplete,"Where are I Got ID, The Long Road and Crazy Mary??? Those 3 are among their best ever songs!!! They must be waiting to add them to the inevitable Vol 2 or box set"
5,Key book on an important topic,"I use Beyond the Magic Bullet all the time in my work with NGOs and students studying the NGO sector. Since this book was published in 1996 some of the case studies seem a bit dated, but the overall message is still fresh and the conceptual frameworks among the best available. Unusually in books about NGOs, this one is clearly written, rigorous and balanced, with no axe to grind either way and a genuine desire to help NGOs understand and deal with the problems of accountability and performance evaluation they face. For an update I would recommend some of Edwards' more recent work, especially Global Citizen Action (edited with John Gaventa) and NGO Rights and Responsibilities (which I bought from Amazon-UK)."
1,Amazon sent me defective parts!!!,"The pair of ball joints that Amazon sent me must have been parts that other people had returned. One ball joint had a hole in the grease boot. The other had a metal plate where the grease fitting hex nut is supposed to be. I can't remove that plate! So there is no way for me to put in the grease fitting! I'd also add that the grease boots don't match each other either.So, while I do still like Moog, buy them elsewhere, preforably someplace where you can inspect them first!If I can, I will upload some pics."
5,Mystery,"This is the fourth book in the Cape Refuge mystery series and completes the story in a satisfactory and fulfilling way. Terri Blackstock is true to her readers, she doesn't ""fool"" any of us while at the same being able to slip in that quirk or surprise fact toward the ending that keeps the reader turning pages. The Cape Refuge characters are warm, smart and human!!! I have read all four of the Cape Refuge series and recommend them highly; they have a Christian slant that is light and does not preach or come on heavy-handed but is very today."
5,Childhood memories,"Love this book, found the same edition to read to my children, I hope they will read it to there children one day."
5,Fantastic Mr. Fox is... well... Fantastic!,"This is a really great story for the young, or young at heart. A very simple read for some, for others it provides a wonderfully entertaining alternative view of society norms through a romantic story of a fox, his family, his friends, and a group of three antagonist humans which show the worst humanity has to offer. Unlike the movie, this story is quite simplistic, and yet insightful and complex in many ways. Roald Dahl, author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach - pulls off another literary triumph from a child's point of view. Illustrated by the author, this reprint of the original is a great size to put into a lunchbox or a briefcase."
2,Lacking Equipment,This item is shown with straps that you can hold on to with your hands. I never received these straps with my package. The manual is not very informative either. And you cannot adjust the tension on the steps. Or at least the manual didn't cover how to.
5,fast but not furious,from the ordering till receiving the item everything was so smooth.thank you amazon
5,Great gift,"I bought a subscription for my niece's 5th birthday. She's very creative and enjoys sending in art for the magazine's art contest. When I babysit, we always do a craft or recipe from the magazine, she loves it!"
3,As a teacher,"I haven't looked through the whole magazine thoroughly, but I think that some of it is a little above the preschool level. I thought I had ordered the preschool level issues but don't see that word anywhere to indicate that. The one thing I would suggest is a change in the wordsearch. The word bank is in lower case letters and the actual puzzle is in upper case letters. To a preshcooler who is just learning the two different kinds of letters that is pretty much an impossible puzzle to solve. If the word bank words were also in upper case letters I think a preschooler could learn to do it, although it would still be difficult because of the layout of word searches (backward and upside down words). There are many things I like about the magazine like the craft activity and the recipe."
3,Not good for small and slim PDA,"The PDA case is too large for the small and slim PDA.Because Targa wants to target to all the PDAs in the market, so the case is a little bit large.Moreover, the stickers (there are two stickers) are too large too. Everytime when I want to take my PDA(Toshiba e755) off and put on the cradle, I need to use a lot of energy as it sticks too tight."
4,Shows Promise,"This is not too bad and album - its really good to hear bands still churning out classic heavy metal.Agreed, the lyrics are not great, but that is not the focus of this music. Lets face it - I could rattle off the names of numerous bands who's lyrics aren't flash. eg. Running Wild, Helloween, Manowar, etc. etc.If you like any of the aforementioned bands, check out Hammerfall. You might be pleasantly surprised."
5,fast shipping and as advertised,excellent book i would recommend this to anyone seriously interested in the art of alchemy. dennis hauck is a leading author on this subject and this book is chock full of information u will use for a lifetime
5,The Precursor of All Belief,"The Emerald Tablet is a well-researched book that documents the earliest spiritual writings known to humankind. It is essential reading for anyone interested in how the Universe really operates, which is about mind, energy, vibration, correspondence, polarity etc.What a great book! Reading this makes one realize where all the other faiths got their material. Hats off to Dennis Hauck and a special ""Namasté"" to Hermes Trismegestus."
1,Not same bulb as pictured.,"The bulb I received was not the long, 2-cylinder bulb in the picture. What I received was one with 4 tubes, which is not the right one for my lamp. This is very disappointing: I'll be sending this back."
3,"Eh, get it if you have...","Get this book if you have the extra cash, it's nothing great, there are some good things in here but mostly it's got reprints, nerfs, and crap. The editing was nonexistent, the errors annoying, and everything else just plain irratating. I reccomend this more for DM's then for Players, because of the new rules."
2,"Sounds great, but hurts my ears","These headphones have great sound quality for the price, but I cannot wear them for more than 15 minutes at a time because they hurt my ears. It would be great if the tension was adjustable!"
4,I shall mourn your passsing...,"I have a similar model of these (MDR G42). They've lasted me about 5 years, but the right side is finally dying. They have EXCELLENT sound quality, and fit snugly behind the head (my favorite type of earphone), however, they do tend to be painful to wear after prolonged use. The foam padding has long fallen away. The one other gripe I have is that they leak a lot of sound to the public space, pretty much unavoidable with this type of earphone though. Overall, these are great earphones but I'd like to try something different."
2,"Great Fit, Poor Performance","I used to buy these headphones exclusively because they fit so well and stay snug to your head during your workout whether it was running, lifting, etc. I'm no audiophile but I felt the sound was completely acceptable and they were comfortable around my ears. Unfortunately, one of the speakers would always die within a short peroid of time(6 months to a year)and you were left listening to music in only one ear. After the this happened on the third pair, I have switched to Phillips headphones(model SHS5200). These fit a bit more loosely but sound good and have lasted two years. I am back today to purchase another pair after one speaker died on the Phillips brand. Perhaps this is inevitable with this type of headphone but I will take two years of wear time with Phillips over 6 mo. to a year on the Sony brand!"
3,Great sound but can be rather uncomfortable,"My Mp3 jukebox came with a similar behind-the-neck style headphones that I really liked so I thought I'd try these Sony ones. I can't say enough for the sound quality...for a relatively cheap set of headphones, it's really excellent. However, the headphones were really uncomfortable for me. They were quite tight, but more of a problem was how sore my ears got wearing them. This may be because I wear glasses, or maybe due to my smaller-than-normal ears, I'm not sure. I just haven't had trouble with other similar headphones before. I even tried removing the extra ear grips these have (nice for if you are doing something really active). That did help some, but I still couldn't stand to wear them. I'd recommend them for the sound quality though, just be aware of possible problems with comfort."
1,Poor quality,This hose is poorly made and won't last long. When attached to my sump pump it bends and kinks. I was hoping for better quality and would not have bought this hose if I had seen it in person.
1,Works Great - if you have the wallet for it,"This product is VERY expensive for what it is. Really, I can use first-aid tape and a Sharpie for everything if these labels didn't look so good. They really do look good. But for the price, words are words. I have found that fabric first-aid tape and a good Sharpie are all you need. Grandma was right."
2,poor state on delivery,Whilst the book is a good and informative text i was very upset by the state of the book on arrival. The book looked like a second hand book with creases. Packaging needs to be done better.
4,"Excellent book, but much too brief.","This is a very good introduction to the basic mathematics used in Wall Street. The author is a professor of mathematics, which explains the ease in which he explains all of the mathematical concepts for even the average reader. The downside to this book is that it does not go very far. Given its small size, only 100 pages, I feel that he could have gone on much further into more advanced topics. He starts with means and variances, and works his way through correlation, risk measures, performance measures, investment planning, and indexes. He wraps up with some ultra-brief comments on ARCH models and neural networks. I would love for him to come out with a much larger, much more detailed, much more advanced book."
2,Peeling/cracking stain,"I bought rustoleum semi transparent concrete kit and watch the included DVD and follow all the instruction. But just after 2 months of pretty stain, it's already peeling off from the concrete. Don't know how to fix white peeled off on the terra cotta stain that I used"
5,"Beautiful, but check it out at the outlet first","I'm a US Air Force officer, so I love the cockpit feel of the face. Great fit and function. However, I just purchased the watch at the Movado outlet for 70% off retail...$145. Check there before buying from Amazon."
3,"Good Quality Optics, bad photo translation","This pair of binoculars has lasted me over 4 years. They are a sturdy, well-built piece. Nevertheless, one should not buy this image viewer for the VGA still camera that is mounted on the device. The camera is by far, this binocular's weak point. I rarely was able to take any pictures in focus. In addition, the camera often produces pictures with light defects.Overall, you should purchase this set with expectations that the camera does not work as described. The binoculars by themselves work splendidly and should last daily use for a long time. They provide clear, crisp views of distant objects. Also, compared to other binoculars, this pair is reasonably compact.I would recommend this produce for those that only require a device that can view distant objects, not properly record them in photo format."
4,Only for those....,"...who can let thing go. What i mean by that is that its similar to the books, but there are so man little things that will make you mad in the first few episodes that you have to except that its different.Still a great tv series that after a few episodes, you will enjoy your decision to watch them."
3,"A must for die-hard fans of the book, not so much for anyone else","This DVD series is a definite must-see for fans of Terry Goodkind's Legend of the Seeker series. The plot is pretty loosely based on the books, but I've definitely enjoyed watching the characters come to life on the screen. The acting's a bit weak to be honest, but I'd still recommend the purchase."
1,Horrible,"Because so many people seem to like this, I forced myself to watch the whole pilot, hoping against hope that the acting and the story would improve. No such luck. It is unnecessary to say that this has nothing in common with the novel it is supposedly based on. If it had, it would have at least a plot and dialogue beyond 'You are the seeker! You will save us from all evil!' *awed stare* slow motion fight scene *more awed stare* 'You ARE the seeker!' swoon... Was there anything I liked about it? The actors were pretty. If my disgust with the acting had not distracted me, I might have enjoyed this as much as an Axe ad."
5,The Best series EVER!!,"I was a fan from beginning to end, but my favorite is Cara!!!! I love all the character though, it is such a Great Show!!"
1,Myabe a few for amusement,"The first few are fairly close to the book story, and I was fairly excited by how they did them, particularly the fight scenes. After that, just pretend you've never seen the books."
2,Blu ray Please,I give the show 4 stars but it was filmed in HD can be downloaded on iTunes in HD so I think it should be coming out on Blu ray that is why I'm giving this 2 stars. Can't wait for the second season to start up!
4,Looking forward to getting it,"Looks great, but one question. Does it include the piece where Chaya Sar/Athar has to leave Major Sheppard at the end, and she glows white?"
2,Don't do it,"If you plan to do any work of any precision with your Dremel, don't bother with this stand. I guess it's cool to be able to rotate the tool, but the problem is that it completely refuses to line up parallel with the stand (pointing straight down) so you end up with your dremel at a slight angle when you are trying to drill straight up and down. The plastic that forms the body of the mount seems to have deformed when it came out of the mold so that there is a bunch of slop in the action, and when you tighten down the locking mechanism it pulls the whole thing out of alignment. You'd be better off getting a stand that doesn't rotate--unless you plan on drilling a bunch of holes at 87 degrees. I've tweaked all the adjustments, and even toolk the whole thing apart and added a bushing to the axle to tighten up the mechanism, but to no avail. It just won't do 90 degrees."
1,Junk,Also found that this press is poor quality.Dremel will send adaptor for there 212 drill press free of charge allowing my xpr to work with 212 style.
1,Great as a toy,"This thing is terribly imprecise and of course a dremel style tool has little power. If your child likes tools and pretending to build things this might be a good present, otherwise get thee a real mini bench-top drill press for $20 more."
2,Very poor build quality even for light-duty work,"I bought this after starting a couple projects that needed very simple drill pres work done - nothing big and certainly nothing that a Dremel tool couldn't handle.I wouldn't buy this again, and I regret not sending it back immediately - it is very poorly designed and not reliable for even the simplest 90-degree cut through soft wood.If you really crank down on some of the fittings, they can be made relatively secure, but the worst part is the handle you pull down to smoothly plunge the bit into the material - the handle's machinery is clearly plastic-on-plastic and binds unevenly throughout its transit."
1,Help???,"I just purchased this with high hopes and just left a scathing review but came back to edit it after reading and following TRA's review. Because of TRA's wonderful help in an above review listing 18 steps on how to put together this work station, I think I just may be able to use this item. If you are having problems, you may want to do what I did and print out TRA's review and go through it step by step. The directions that came with this item are really lacking. I've put many, many things together and this one gave me fits.It's not the best work station and I may still go out and buy a drill press, but truly you get what you pay for."
1,Wrong Parts!,"I was so excited to get this work station for my dremel. And so disappointed that it appears to be a used unit or a returned item. The telescoping pole does not appear to be the correct pole it is too thin. It has a part stuck in one end, so there is only one end option to slide it in. It is way to loose to telescope it just flops to the side, no support. I feel sure it is the wrong tube."
5,Love it!,"I love it's multi purpose features.The fact alone that it can hold my heavy rotary tool so I can use the flex shaft easier makes me give this workstation five stars.I haven't used it as an actual drill press yet, but I've used it for all the other uses listed and shown.I have also used it as a reverse router table. Be careful if you use it this way too, because the bit is a little more exposed to your hands compared to a normal router table. But I love that I can see what the router bit is doing to the top of the piece of wood I am working on. Just set the rotary tool to the depth you want and rout away!"
4,XECELENTE HERRAMIENTA,"Fue una excelente compra, al abrir el embalaje y sacar los accesorios, me encontre con una pieza rota, ahora me pregunto ¿ quien me repondra esta pieza rota o devuelvo el producto al vendedor y me cambie por otro nuevo y en buenas condiciones?Atte.JORGE SANCHEZ"
3,Shaky,"Not very good work station if you are using it for drilling some holes on PCB, it's not very accurate."
3,dremel,"It does much of what I want it to do, problem is it is only good for very light work or as a holder for the dremel for some jobs. Many of the parts are plastic and it moves around when the product is in use, any preasure placed on the tool and it distorts from center. I have got good use out of it anyway but it wont take the place of a drill press. If it was made of all metal it would be a sweet tool with few flaws."
5,A Great Book - of Any Kind,"I am an avid cookbook collector and also an avid reader, (and maybe a bit of a nostalgic). But Marilyn Kluger is by far my favorite cookbook ""author."" She has written here, and also in her book, The Wild Flavor, wonderful accounts of her life in the midwest - growing up in Country Kitchens, and raising her own children in Wild Flavor. Her accounts of gathering wild fruits actually sent me on a trip one September to the Ohio River valley in search of Paw Paws. The power of her narrative was that great! The recipes are also wonderful. I have found each one of them to be a treasure in their ability to bring back the flavors of my own childhood. Good home cooking and wonderful stories to boot! Happy reading and baking!"
5,"Unique, a great read and wonderful recipes!","I read this 'recipe book' from cover to cover. I've tried a few of the recipes and they turned out great too! The story of the author's childhood centered around her mother's kitchen in a small farm in Indiana beginning in the mid-1930's is fascinating. Not a dull moment! This was a great addition to my library. It is not only a cookbook, but also a history book."
4,Works Great,"It works as advertiesed. No annoying passwords and increased security. What if someone found out your password? With this, it doesn't matter. I gave it 4 stars because what if you get a cut in your finger that slightly alters your fingerprint. It hasn't happened, but I don't know what will happen. If your lazy, want security, or just want the coolness factor, u should definetally get it."
5,Excellent for Composite Video Connections,"If you are forced to use composite video cable connectors, Monster Cable delivers the best signal by eliminating unwanted artifacts from other sources delivering the best possible signal from your VCR, DVD or Laser Disc player. Gold RCA contacts and double shielding of multi-stranded conductors provides improved performances delivering an excellent signal. Highly recommended!"
2,Mine died after 30 minutes use,"Amazon shipped quickly. The grinder is a comfortable size and weight. The paddle switch is easy to use and is a nice safety feature. I've used it now for 2 jobs but it suddenly died on the 2nd job - after no more than 30 minutes total combined use. I used it when it arrived to cut cabinet openings into Hardieboard (concrete board), a 20 minute job. I used it again two weeks later to cut three 18 in square concrete pavers in half. After 5-10 minutes use, it just stopped working while I cutting the 3rd paver. I now have to send it to a factory service center and I hope they replace it with a new one without a hassle.12/5/08I had this repaired under warranty. I was told by the factory-approved service ctr that the problem was a broken wire. No further problems since it's been serviced."
4,producto muy bueno,"recoiendo al vendedor y el producto son confiables, la unico de malo es que es demasiado costoso, me salio mas caro que en mi pais, antes de comprar consulten precios en sus propios paises,"
1,"BASIC,BASIC,BASIC","I read the reviews by others and found them to be with the exception of 1 person, not at all in line with my recommendation. If you are looking for a reference book this is not it. This book seems to be an oversight of access 97. Didn't help me in any respect to accomplishng the tasks I needed to accomplish. I could not find one help to guide me through my questions. I would recommend this book only to totally new beginners to software use."
1,Could not this DVD to work on any of my machines!,I could not get this DVD to work on either of my DVD's? A second copy was sent by you and it still did not operate on my DVD's! I finally settled on purchasing the more expensive Criterion Edition of Viridiana. That worked fine and I give the DVD 5 stars! A lot of calls and returns for what should be a simple purchase!
5,I loved this show as a kid,"I loved Toxic Crusaders as a kid. I watched the show, had the toys and read the comics the only thing I forgot to was tape this sdhow whgich I really regret and until I heard of the DVDs coming I thought I'd never see this show again. Man I'm so glad that it's coming on DVD. I can't wait to get this."
3,Decent beginner clubs but missing needed clubs,"The clubs themselves are not bad, but there is no sand wedge and is missing a driver. There should have been more clarification of what clubs were included."
4,I have the other book. Modern Antiques for theTable,I have the other book Modern Antiques for the Table. So I knew what this was about.It is what I wanted.Very good book.
5,well written,"One of the best books on Oak Island that I have read. This book is well written, compelling and easy to read. It is full of well known, as well as lesser know facts concerning Oak Island."
2,A Child's Picture English/italian Dictionary,"The book that was sent by the company was English/Chinese. That one was very nice, beautiful pictures, very good condition, etc. However, I ordered English/Italian so I returned to book to the company."
2,Sadly not that useful,"I run an Eberron campaign and was really eager for one of my players to get this. I thought it would hold most of the information from the Eberron Campaign Setting book, only with the 'behind the scenes' details and story paths ripped out. I was hoping it would provide the players with a great explaination of the lands, the houses, etc., but it really falls short. The format is really strange, and I find it hard to find what I'm looking for. The information is also not nearly as useful as anything in the campaign setting book, so usually I end up just pulling information from there, rewriting it sometimes to take out details that my players shouldn't know about. Kind of a bummer, as I really liked the idea of this book."
3,Great White get softer,"I am a fan of GW, but this album is a bit dissapointing. They sound much less power (imaging playing hard rock music with acoustic guitar) and a little boring. For GW fans this album might be OK, but if you look for GW's styles like in their Twice Shy, or Hooked, this album sound very tender."
4,Great USB2.0HD,I think this is a great external USB 2.0 HD. What I like most about this HD is USB 2.0 and its low price.What I don't like about it is that it is not eligible for Super Saver Shipping.
2,Misleading,"The product title is misleading. This is not a KitchenAid Whirlpool PUR ""Ultimate"" Filter as the title suggests. It is a four pack of ""Advanced"" filters which remove less contaminates than the ""Ultimate"" filter sold at Sears.These are the three levels of filter quality.Ultimate = Best (what I wanted)Advanced = Good (what I got)Deluxe = Fair"
5,One of the best albums ever!,"As a fan of The Babys and John Waite I bought this album with alot of anticipation. While some of his solo work had been disappointing, I had heard him perform a couple tunes from this effort via a television show. I was not disappointed at all. From beginning to end this is a first class piece of work. His songwriting has never been better. The only drawback is a cover of Hank Williams, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry. It's a poor cover and really doesn't fit at all with the rest of the albums tunes and feel. Other than this, it's well worth the price of admission."
2,Fossil Shark Teeth,"Very general and not very comprehensive, not worth $20 to me, but I'm really into fossil sharks and so was expecting too much, I suppose."
3,I did not get a snug fit,"This stroller cover is very cute and stylish,,,but when the wind blows I have to hold the sides down."
5,protect-a-bub stroller raincover,"I love this raincover.I was so tired of all those plastic covers.They tore all the time and once opened very hard to fold again.Took up so much storage underneath if not using.Then bought the protect- a bub- cover and love it.Soft, easy to fold,fits stroller perfectly,little window,air vents etc,.My daughter cried all the time when i pulled the old cover over the stroller,so she ended up wet all the time.She has absolutely no problem with the protect-a-bub.(does like sticking her hands out the vents to feel the rain do?)All my friends with kids asking about it.We all love and recommend this."
5,easy to use,I got caught in a rain storm at a parade and I just pulled this out of the little sack holder it comes in which I had tied to the handle of the stroller and in less than a minute I was able to cover the stroller. It was pouring rain and my baby was snug and dry in his stroller while I was soaking wet.
1,I do not believe this was ever delivered.,I do not believe this was ever delivered. I recall purchasing it but do not recall receiving it??????????
2,just the facts,"I purchased this book as a guide to the Verde river, but it was really rather vague. It detailed th smells an sounds in the morning, but failed in giving me much about the river an alternative acces points and times it takes to raft to different points. This book is crap for anyone rafting the verde."
1,Phillips should recall this model,"Much the same as many other reviews of this TV. I have had the tv for 3 1/2 rs, just past the extended 3 yr. warranty I bought through Walmart. When I turn it on a loud screeching noise comes out of the speaker, the tv will shut off and and off and on several times until it finally stays off.This this seems to be a fairly common problem and I believe Phillips should recall this model and offer a free fix. They used to have a great reputation many years ago, but that has obviously changed."
4,great tv for prize and size,I love this tv. The sound is great and the picture is beautiful. It was easy to set up. Make sure to purchase an HDMI cable to hook it up to your hdtv cable box.
1,not impressed for the money,"we were very disatisifed in this product for the price,there is no way to adjust the courseness of the pepper it is of one consistancy ,very fine grain,can it be returned?"
1,The most stupidist game ive evered played,"This game was not fun at all, if you like college strip tease and stuff then this is for you. All you do is walk around their's women and college student's you play strip and other stupid game's. This game was just dumb, this is what any other college student dose so this game was a waste of time."
1,Useless,"The first couple of uses were great, but after that I learned that it was cheaply made. The dispensers don't have a great seal on them, so your liquor will leak everywhere. I came home to an entire bottle all over my counter. It also is very unstable. Mind you, I had 750mL bottles attached to the carousel, and it still managed to wobble. Over a few days of use, the center piece began to lean and wobble even more. The only great thing I'd have to say is that I did try a liter and it held on to the suction cups pretty well. Overall, however, this carousel liquor dispenser is junk."
1,Just say no to this obsolete keyboard,Just picked one up 11/1/2010 from Target for about the same price as Amazon. Opened box and found large receiver (mouse sized)with large cable attached. IMHO this is not wireless. Who would want the cable and receiver when you can get the small usb receiver smaller than a dime and easy to travel with.There is another post from 2008 so that tells me this thing is obsolete.Mine is going back.
2,Mouse is often unresponsive,The mouse consistently has problems when I click either the right or left button. It seems that the mouse goes to sleep in about three seconds after it leave it alone (I'm assuming to save battery life). The problem is that I often have to click 2-3 times to click link or select text. It seems to take a little while to wake up.The movement of the mouse is always pretty responsive. It does not see mto have the same issue.I'm going to return this wireless keyboard/mouse kit today because the mouse is so unresponsive.
2,Mal teclado,"Lo tengo hace más de un año y siempre tengo problemas con el teclado. El mouse funciona bien, de hecho es muy bueno y comodo, pero el teclado omite letras, es casi imposible realizar control+C (para copy-paste) y que funcione bien. Ademas no se puede jugar con un teclado asi.Lo bueno son los botones extras, que ademas son personalizables desde windows."
2,"If your computer table is metal, don't get this!","I have to compact, and have a metal computer table, perfect size. Nowhere in the description for this wireless did it say you cannot use on metal. This is great if I'm working long hours on the computer; I get in my easy chair, prop my feet up and go for it, which is great. But short-term, which is most of the time, I have to balance it in my lap until I figure a way around this. If you do not have a wood desk, this would be great. If your desk or keyboard tray is metal, just keep on looking."
2,Not for couch surfing,"I bought this because it was cheap. I wanted to sit on my couch 8 ft away and surf the internet on my TV. I know it states 6ft, but I was being an optimistic cheapskate. The mouse handles the distance well, but the keyboard has to be practically ""jam up against"" the receiver to work (within a foot or so, and on the same level). So I guess that is ""almost"" wireless. I have to get my lazy self off the couch, and kneel on the floor to use the keyboard. Going to get a 2.4 gHz set up now (a cheaper one of course) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RV01LI/ref=oss_product. We'll see."
3,Good cost/benefit,"It is a good product, very cheap and though it does not eliminated cable, which is wireless purpose, it reduces them."
4,mustard seed of magic review,"Once you've met Tish Sterling, you can't let her go. The fourth book in her series is as intriguing as the others, although I was disappointed by the ending, which left her relationship with Ken up in the air. The real shock, of course, comes in book five, which is from the point of view of Tish's niece, Saranne. Overall, I love Johnston's writing, her poignant phrases and insight into family life and struggles common to all kids. Despite the drama (sometimes melodrama), it is a book I read over and over again."
4,Basehead grows up,"I was a bit taken a back 5 years ago when this album first came out, could this possible be the same guy who once wrote songs like ""Do You Want To ... or What?"" and ""Ode To My Favorite Beer,"" but sure enough it is!Many listens later I grew to love it just as much as the rest of their discography. This is my least favorite of their 3 albums, but no doubt this is light years ahead of any other hip hop artist out there today. Smooth, jazzy & intelligent, it's a crime that Basehead didn't make a big splash. God bless you Michael Ivey, wherever you are!"
4,Still fresh!,"I dug this record out of my voluminous tape collection to see if it could stand the test of time. And... it does! Annie Lennox (of Eurythmics fame) sounds fantastic, purring background vocals. The overall sound of of the record is Euro-lovenightlife angst--if you know what I mean(!) It should be said that Robert Gorl sings most of the vocals and is a fine singer. The songs presage alot of what is now called American Deep House with their repetitive hooks and spare and emotive vocals. I must have the CD of this record!"
2,A Sad Little Book,I have to agree with others who've derided this book. The Cohen's venom ultimately drowns out any kind of sympathy the reader might muster.
4,A Touching Book,"This book blew me away! I had always heard of the Pan Am 103 disaster at Lockerbie, but until I read the Cohen's account of the disaster, I never understood exactly what happened. The book details the anguish of loosing a child, the incompetance of the United States government and its leaders, and the persuit of ""justice"" by the Cohens. I say justice, but the Cohens, in actuality were really attempting to ""put a face on the disaster,"" and that face was the one of their daughter, Theo.The book did drag at parts, and that only occured when either Dan or Susan would overload on information, but that happened only two or three times. My favorite part of the book was Susan's last entry, which she wrote as a letter to her beloved Theo. Congratulations Dan and Susan, you succeeded! I will never be able to forget the disaster, or your daughter, the face you have now associated with the disaster."
1,"Sad, Angry, and Uninformed","One can be sympathetic to family members of the Pan Am 103 tragedy. Unfortunately being sad and angry does not guarantee knowledge of the intimate details of this tragedy. For real knowledge of what happened read Marquise' book ""ScotBom""."
3,Amazing results!,"The Canon BJC 8200 and Photo Paper Plus will give unbelievable results, better than any photo paper I have used. You won't believe it. I print my digital photos and they are as good or better than from a film camera. I have scanned and repaired old photos, and on this paper they come out perfect. My friends didn't believe that I printed the pictures myself."
4,Wow!,"I have used many different brands and types of paper for printing photos, but I have been completely won over by this paper. I have had so many compliments on the ""photo lab"" look, and many people turn the photos over to see where they were processed! While it is expensive paper (which is why I gave 4 stars rather than 5), it is the only one I'll use to print my keeper photos. I have friends who say they have switched to using this, too."
2,Takes WAY too long to pick up signal,"The unit is overall OK, but it takes a very long time every time you turn it on to pick up a signal and you can miss important turns. I suggest another brand!"
5,A Bold Initiative!,It's about time someone had the guts to write a book like this. I heard one of the authors on Wisconsin radio. Thanks for reminding me what I have to appreciate in the United States. It's easy to forget just how good we have it.
3,a good help for beginners,"The ""quick and dirty"" of the stranger markings of BHS. For those not well-versed in Latin, German, or Aramaic, this little reference is quite handy. Scott does not bother with the history or evolution of the Tiberian Masorah or other markings, but rather simply gives what is necessary to successfully derive meaning from both the Masorah Magna and Masora Parva (but not the Masorah Finalis) as well as some of the accentation and other markings. The most useful feature of this reference work is its size - it's very small and slim, so much so that it may have a propensity to get lost frequently."
3,Average Flamenco - OK for beginners,"I found this DVD a little showie, average for the beginner, but I do recommend that Reina slows down a bit especially as it is a learner video. I think that you can order better DVD'S to learn from especially from www.esflamenco.com where you can by a set of 10 in the different flamenco styles.I didn't like the hairdressing tip at the beginning, it was a waste space on the DVD. They could of shown more styles, but OK if you don't have anything else to learn from."
3,center piece,I was wondering if that center piece comes in red and does it fit any size antlers. And is that the only shape the wooden plaque comes in.
2,Good Story,"The movie had a cool storyline; however, it trudged along very slowly. I didn't know which way the movie was going...Was it a story about schizophrenia, or were the man's visions a telling of what is to come? Hmmmm...Just when things were finally realized, the movie ended, and this left the audience wondering what will happen to the family.Just a little bit more of the story would have been good.Overall, while it's an interesting story, the movie did seem a bit slow."
3,Poor writing good acting,"Take Shelter is one of those movies that keeps your interest and then lets you down in the end. An alternate ending is needed for this movie, one with more drama and follow through. The casts does as good as they can with the slow moving movie. I would say rent it if you can;t find anything to watch but do not buy."
2,This was very over rated,One of the most mundane story lines I've seen...... Kept waiting for something to happen! Oh and the ending.... You'll walk away wondering why you watched the whole thing.
1,Takes too long to go anywhere,"I thought this would be an entertaining post apocalyptic thriller, but instead far too much time is spent with the hero thinking he's going crazy, visiting his schizophrenic mom, and developing the small folksy hometown feel of this small Ohio town. I watched 45 minutes and all that happened is the hero had a few bad dreams. I fast forwarded to the end to find out how it all ended, but I was disappointed.I thought the film was atmospheric, and I liked the characters and if there was a sequel which might explain what happened next, I could've gone for it, but far too much buildup for me not to want to see the payload which is barely touched on in the last few minutes of the show.I was disappointed."
1,Pointless and Anticlimactic,"Don't waste your time or money on this pointless and anticlimactic excuse for a movie. I usually hope to be, at the very least, slightly entertained from a 3 1/2 star movie. Unfortunately, you can literally fast forward this movie every 15 minutes, watch it for 2 minutes, and not miss anything. It's pointless, boring, and anything but,entertaining. Lots of better movies out there......"
1,"Slow, predictable, and the worst movie I've ever seen","This is the worst movie, I have seen in 10 years. 'Got Milk' used to hold that place on my scale.Everything moved so slow, and in the end you feel like you wasted your time. There wasn't a twist ending.The guy's 'storm shelter' was a shipping container. Even if there was a natural disaster, that would have been his tomb. What a joke.I couldn't even stand watching the whole thing, I had to fast forward every few minutes."
2,Ho Hum,"It could have, it should have but it didn't. Great idea, good acting but so endlessly dragged on to ending I no longer cared about, I just wanted the movie to be over."
3,Not what I expected....,"From the previews, I kind of expected a good doom and gloom movie, not a psychological thriller. In a large way, it demeans the prepper culture as ""crazy,"" instead of responsibly looking out for your own. Acting and script were fine. Decent movie, just not what I expected or wanted to see. I wish I had my money back. My loss."
1,"I would give this no stars, if I could.","The author does not seem to be able to talk about modern China without dwelling upon his past experiences in China. It would be acceptable if not for the fact that most of the portions I read seem to be a poorly written memoir of him, and not a useful guide on how to get by in China. Also, his advice is mostly outdated and he doesn't seem to be able to give good, useful advice that actually pertains to situations one might encounter."
5,"Xie xie, (Thank you), Kevin Sinclair","Kevin Sinclair was so accurate in his description of traveling in China that we felt he had walked the same hutongs, crossed the same streets [carefully], been courted by the same businessmen at the same restaurants drinking the same liquids and toasting, [and re-toasting] each others' good health. Though we didn't understand most of the toasts that were offered us, we offer this to toast to Kevin Sinclair: ""For making our trip to China a blast! For encouraging us to get to know the people and the places, and for helping us to understand the Chinese way, so that we were truly able to enjoy and celebrate the diversity of human lifestyles!"" And to those who are heading to China - read it! Or why bother going?"
5,"Monster Speaker Cable S16-50, 16 Gauge","Not a lot can be said about speaker cable. It either performs as advertised, or doesn't. This cable performs as advertised. Order was processed rapidly, delivered in a timely manner, and packaging was appropriate for the merchandise. Installation and operation was normal."
3,i did not receive my dvd yet !!!,"i receive an e-mail from laser corner telling me that my shipment was lost in the mail dep!! & they asked me if i need to refund my money or order another dvd ,,,so i answerd him that i still want my dvd(learn flamencoII:gypsy tango) & i am still waiting !!!!!"
4,A Priceless Piece of History,"Baryshnikov arrived in America with a bang. I believe this was one of his earliest performances in the US. He is partnered with a scary Gelsey Kirkland, deep in her anorexic period. Although it hurts to see her so thin and shaky, Mr. Baryshnikov partners her with surety. His last solo is a collection of comedic/dramatic character portrayals that keeps the audience thoroughly entertained. This concert from Wolf Trap is worth watching over and over again. (Don't miss the comments by Ms. Kirkland warning young dancers that her way was not the best way.)"
2,Pixel protector,Useless When it comes to loosening stuck DLP mirrors. I would advise not wasting money on this product if trying to correct a DLP failure.
1,DOSE NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,TRIED IT FOR 3 WEEKS DID NOT WORK ON MY PIONEER PLASMA 50 INCH THAT ESPN IMAGE BURN IN IT ....THE ONLY THING IT DID WORK ON WAS IMPROVING THE PICTURE COLOR ----[...]
2,Minimal instructions,"The instructions for use of this DVD are minimal at best. Supposedly you can go to their website for more detailed instructions, but retail customers must register for their forum to see the instructions. It would have been far more convenient if the instructions were included, either in printed form or on the disk itself. I can't comment on whether the DVD will fix ""stuck pixels."" You must run it for many hours to achieve that result."
1,Wishy - Washy images,"This program looked nice as advertised. However, when I ran the program, the movie clips were of low resolution. The color was all washed out, and the images blurry and overall cyan colored. Was disappointed with this program, called the manufacturer, and was told it was supposed to be shown on a big screen television. I have a high resolution 21"" computer screen, and 25"" television screen, it was not very nice to look at on either, let alone the annoying bubble sounds in the background, which cause you to lower the volume after awhile. Not at all what I thought it should be. Take it from me, I'd keep away from this program. It should be in the racks in a dollar store!"
5,Perfect,I love this video everyone thought i brought a fish tank. Order the video 4 yourself the better tv the better your video i have a 42in Lg hd and cheap dvd player! Not a bad video at all! Thx Amazon u haven't failed me yet
3,Aquarium on the TV,"My husband and I bought the aquarium and the fireplace DVD. We are enjoying the fireplace now since it's winter and we will have the aquarium in the summer. We have friends over and they swear they are warmer because of the fireplace on the TV. Funny, isn't it.I'm sure they will feel cooler in the summer looking at the water with the beautiful coral and colorful fish. We ordered both at the same time so we could get free shipping. We recommend both."
5,my favorite cologne,I have used this cologne for many years; but it is not longer available where I used to purchase it. I was so thankful to know I could purchase it here. I receive many compliments on it. Shipping was excellent.
3,"Its ok, I guess...",Gets the job done... has a VERY annoying LED light that constantly blares and so wasnt a good choice by my nightstand.
3,Don't use Amazon's dowload service,"Other download services offer phone support. Amazon provides eform support. Amazon promises to respond within 24-hours, but this just isn't good enough. NOT industry standard. TaxCut2003 software wouldn't open after download, and it's three days until taxes are due. I'll probably head out to OfficeMax tomorrow, and have Amazon issue a credit."
1,Piece of junk!!,"The metal frame that comes with this started bending the first week, and every time someone sits on it the frame swings back and hits the wall. I called Amazon to see about returning it but it turned into a big problem with me trying to figure out how to package it for shipping, and I decided to just accept the partial credit they offered me instead, but I wish I hadn't. I get mad every day when I look at this thing. I'm guessing the company that sells these wrote the positive reviews for this product because it really is complete GARBAGE! Before buying it please look at the reviews and photos under the same model in the expresso color to get a good idea of what it will look like after you use it. I'll be replacing this real soon."
3,Lots of errors...,"I'm really enjoying skimming through this interesting reference. Lots of great entries and cross-referencing. Unfortunately, I've run across several big errors. For example, MacKillop has Bran mac Febal turning to dust at the end of the story, where reference to Kuno Meyer's translation reveals that it was not Bran but one of his men that was turned to dust. Bran relates his story and then 'from that hour his wanderings are not known'. This was only one of several obvious errors. I sincerely hope they are corrected in subsequent editions!"
2,Poor Finish,This arrived scratched and the edges where very rough so much so I cannot use this in my home
3,kid talk,A little disappointing. Our family has to skim through a few cards before we find one that seems fun.
5,Great for kids!,I'm using this for a social skill class and I love that there is a topic with some background info. It helps to build upon the conversation and is educational.
2,Shilling...,I'm quite shocked at the blatant shilling for this product. Some of the reviews are even reposted with the exact same text from months back. Beware when reading marketing text posing and actual customer reviews.
5,This is Very All Access,"My father works for Barnes and Noble and pulled strings for an advance copy on July 1st for this item considering the Hil addict I am. Matthew Rettermund and Keith Munyan have certainly done it with the book! This is certainly the most pleasing, informative,best picture-covered book on Hilary. The rarest pictures, the best information and everything. If you are tweens and teens that are Hilary fans, this will rock your world and if you are parents that want a good biography on your daughter or son's favorite celeb, Hilary Duff this is the best way to please their faces Three words, America: Buy this book!"
3,The pin assortment do not include the small pin I needed.,"I bought this to remove the clip holding on the roller wheel on my dryer.Upon receipt, I found that the assortment of pins (which fit in the holes of the clips)did not include small enough pins. I ended up snipping a baby pin into bits and inserting those into the tool.Would have been nice for them to include smaller pins."
4,I'd recommend to a friend,"The drive works as expected, and there have been no issues thus far. The drive and permanently attached cable fold to fit in the side pouch of my book-bag. It is great for getting data from a lab device and moving it to my MBP (laptop)."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I specifically ordered this product because it was the men's version of the bracelet. There is a regular version available as well from a different vendor. This men's version feels very big on my wrist. It would slide half way up my forearm until I bent it closed. Now it fits, but i can't take it off.Also beware the quality. Stainless steel is pretty hard to mess up, but the writing is another thing. I've had it one about two weeks and half of the black in the stamping has come off. Now, I kind of like the recessed silver on silver look, but others may not."
5,Godly instruction,"I love the way Charles Stanley explains things so clearly. He is a very godly teacher and someone I have the utmost respect for. He's a very humble man who understands God and God's purpose for man. I highly recommend any and all of Charles Stanley's books, tapes, CDs because I have quite a few and I haven't been disappointed yet. He shares life's lessons and doesn't judge -- he's awesome."
5,A great deal of insight in a little book,"People with rage need to read this book a couple of times; it is geared toward folks that do not need excuses/blames for their behavior anymore. Eleven (11) steps he mentions that he goes through in details:1. Take a time-out to stop the violence.2. Wipe that frown off your face and relax.3. Quit trying to control others.4. Accept differences.5. Ask, don't demand.6. Reward, don't punish or threaten.7. Speak quietly and don't swear.8. Be responsible for what you say.9. Treat others with respect.10. Tell others what bothers you. Be direct, specific, and polite.11. Use ""I"" statements."
3,probably ok for its intended audience...,"Of people who have major league anger issues and are aware of the problem. If you are still in denial or are not in such bad shape, its much less useful. The book compares ""blaming and shaming"" others (bad) and ""telling others what is bothering you"" (good)- but I'm not sure whether the author would draw the line between these."
2,and now for the rest of the story,"I had previously written a ""review"" wherein I expressed my dismay at the misuse of words, such as peaked when what was meant was ""piqued"", etc. I would like to add a post script that after writing to the publishing company with my comments I received a very nice note from the author and she conceded that the editing had been inadequate and that a reprint is in the works. She also defended her use of ""cajun"" sounding surnames and I bow to her experience of living in Alexandria far longer than I did. So, in the immortal words of Emily Litella (and if you're a fan of SNL, you know who I'm talking about): ""nevermind""."
5,Couldn't put the book down,I enjoyed this book so much that my husband wants to read it. My sister-in-law suggest that I read this book because I used to live in LA and went to school at Northeast Louisiana University. I enjoyed every word in this book. I can't wait for Vickey's next book to come out.
5,Fall and winter perfection,"This is the only album that i own/have heard from The album leaf, but it is pretty much exactly what i love about this particular genre of music. It is terribly pretty, the few lyrics there are are beautifuly sung, and is perfect to listen to either with full attention, or as background music. The piano work on it is just my taste, and the strings add so much. Perfect for anyone who feels deep emotions just from listening to instruments being played. And Pall a. Jenkins of the Black Heart Procession adds some of his saw work and lyrics, which work out beautifully.Track that best represents the whole album- ""Over the pond"", its incredible."
4,A good printer,"I have been using this printer for about a year now and it has been performing well. I is installed at a school on our network. It was easy to set up and connecting to it is fast and easy. The only complaint that I have is that it must stay on all the time; otherwise it eats up about an entire stick of ink. The print quality is good, the time per page is reasonable and the doubles sided feature saves the school quite a bit of paper. Overall I would recommend this printer, just be aware of the ink problem when shutting down other wise its great."
1,Tax Cut Errors,I switched to Tax Cut this year based on a review in PC Magazine. Wrong decision. Tax Cut errors caused many program initiated shut downs. At last moment Tax Cut advised delete program-just as I attempted to e-mail my return- and had to uninstall and reinstall program and return. Still unable to send by e-file. What a mess. The program is just not as user friendly as I expected. Tax Cut has more work to do. A no recommend. Either pencil or back to Turbo Tax.
4,Decent software,"I've used this s/w before and have never had problems with it.Admitedly my return isn't that complicated (Sch A, B, Ira's, etc) but still, not to bad.It could be easier to navigate and to enter info directly onto schedules, but other than that no complaint. I've e-filed perfectly the 1st time everytime I've used it.Let's just see about the rebates though, I pray it's not the scam it is w/ Turbo Tax."
2,Don't waste your time!,"I had mixed reviews from Amazon before I bought this, as well as from the state version, but I figured it only cost $20 for both after rebates, what could it hurt? Total waste of time! This program is just that, cheap! Eventhough this is my first time attempting to file for myself, I am a self-employed massage therapist and have been paying taxes on it for 4 years now. I thought their questions were too vague and the program skipped around a lot. For example, if you were wanting to go back to the last question, it might take you way back to the beginning of the section instead....Very confusing and poorly made.I could have all the numbers right, but I don't want to be so quick to pay the IRS $1000! I think I will pay $130 to take my print out to a professional and get some advice from them for the future."
1,This program is a stinker!,"This program stinks! First of all, it took me forever to do my taxes on this d*** thing. Then we had to download the State Taxes after it said on the box that it was included with the Federal Taxes. Next, when all was said and done (yea right!) it said I had warnings and erros but it didn't say how to fix it. After many screams and hollers, I was ready to e-file (a big joke!); I had to fill out even more paper work then I did when I had to do it by snail mail. And I couldn't even print it out for snail mail! Whoever made this program, must have been a nerd who got picked on a lot and this is their revenge.This program stinks, stay away from it and do what you normally do. All this does is ask you bogus questions about, God knows what, and you're left with anger and fustration. I'd give this a big fat ZERO if I could but it gets a one by default."
2,A maddening program,"I used Turbo Tax for several years with few problems but decided to try TaxCut this year, since it is cheaper and, according to reviews at Amazon, quite similar.I may have saved about ten dollars, but it took me four or five hours longer to do my taxes than would have been the case had I used Turbo Tax. TaxCut does not download 1099 information from most financial institutions, the ""help"" feature is almost always well... unhelpful. One calculation in my return was unquestionably wrong (the software designers seemed to suspect that it might not give the right figure for many users and thus suggests overriding the program's calculation--but overriding a single figure means the program will not allow you to file electronically. The program mysteriously made extra copies of many forms.The main point of TaxCut seems to be to sell H&R Block products. If you want a user friendly tax preparation program, you would do well to look elsewhere."
2,My last year with TaxCut,"I have used TaxCut for 4 years, ever since TurboTax decided that customers should be marketed to death with in product ads.This year while I'm paying for a state download, the marketing ads are the only thing that works. My credit card was charged, but no download screen. IE errors when trying to print the reciept, I had to use a Mozilla based HTML reader after saving the email to disk. Why does a email reciept have to be so loaded with HTML ads for nonrelated products that IE creates script errors?I never did get the state download, the web pages never load. I can't ask for help, no email address ever appears and a telephone call is $10.00.I don't want to go back to Intuit and the endless ads. Now Turbotax is a ""maximum marketing"" product as well.Calculator - $1.00Pencil - 10 centsForms - freeNot having the pencil crash and the calculator market me - ****** Priceless ******"
1,what da?,"i got this mouthpeice for my trumpet. i got it in a 7c, and the shank wont even fit in my damn horn! i dont know what the deal is! i cant find anything that says about shank size"
1,non-reducing cream,"This reducing cream does nothing but make your skin feel weighed down. The jar is small & it does nothing to decrease cellulite or fat, don't waste your money"
2,"Flimsy, and having to wait on the bugs is really irritating","When I got this item I was instantly disappointed. First, the container is very flimsy and thin, I don't see it holding anything for long, and the last thing I want is a bunch of creepy mantis creatures crawling around my place. Not to mention you have to pay more for the bugs, then wait forever for them to come!"
5,"No easy read or quick fix, but filled with golf knowledge","I read both reviews before buying the book. Both were right. Not simple entertainment and not quick fixes, but certainly a lot of information. No stories of the tour and a lot of abstract ideas make it less fun reading, but I thought it was better than any other mental game book out there-like the difference between playing a golf course with windmills and Pebble Beach."
5,Even Lutherans agree.....,".... this is a great book.That may seem a little strange, especially since Olson has some less than charitable comments about the Reformation and our beliefs, but I've found that Olson and I are on the same page on far more issues than we disagreed.This isn't just a book for Catholics, even though it's written from a Catholic perspective and mostly so Catholics will see the difference between the dispensational premillennialists and the RCC. This book is valuable to anyone with an interest in eschatology, especially if you're curious about what's out there besides dispensational premillennialism (since they dominate the market and make the most noise).Buy this book now!"
1,LAME!,"I'm so glad I saw this as a Instant Play on Netflix because I would have been highly upset if I actually paid for this. It wasn't ""spine-chilling and deeply thought-provoking."" It was lame. Warren was extremely annoying and melodramatic. The ""scary"" monster voice made me laugh. I felt more like I was watching a mockumentary than a documentary. Don't waste your money!"
4,5-year-old's mom,"O.K., so it is a little inane. It's also a lot of fun, especially read aloud. My son is on his second listening, and loves to giggle as we go along. What's nice for little kids is that there are no scary parts, but there is still suspense. And I love the little girl with her personal weather system."
3,B movie at its best,"""She"" is an excellent example of a B movie. We should not expect it to be award winning material. It has an fairly interesting story line if you're not trying to make it something it is not. Sandahl Bergman is always good to watch in these kinds of roles and does them well. A good movie to watch on a late Saturday night."
5,Great Idea!!!,It's a terrific filter holder. It easily holds all of my 55mm round filters and makes my filtered shots a breeze. My only regret is that I didn't invent it.
3,RIFFAGE!!!!,"I saw these guys opening for The Sword. Wicked riffs galore! ""Circle of Servants Bodies"" is the highlight here. This short little EP is the perfect introduction to a band that I hope to hear more from in the future. The only downside is that the singer is not the best, but hell there's been plenty of bands that rock and their singers were lacking. It will grow on you because you will be banging your head to these three fierce tunes."
3,2nd half an interesting study of g. waves detection politics,"Skip the first 400 pages, unless you're obsessed with Joe Weber. But read the second 400 for an interesting take on the politics and people involved in gravity wave detection. Also a decent presentation of the issues in gravity wave detection for non-physicists."
3,Good basic information but not enough detail for all moms.,"This book would be wonderful for a first time mom or a mom who is breastfeeding for the first time and has a cranky child. The book has good nutrition guidelines and information on what might be causing your child to be distressed during or after feeding. If, however, you have been dealing with lactose or milk protein problems with your other children as babies, this book probably won't give you much more information than you already have. If you are like me, you've been searching for help on what foods could cause stomach upset, and how to deal with dairy problems in breastfeeding. This book gave me no new information. The recipes looked like good basic recipes but there was nothing there that I haven't seen in other cookbooks."
4,"""I Want to Buy a Vowel""","With many funny scenes and lines ""I Want to Buy a Vowel"" would have to be the best book I have read so far. For the first time reading one of John Welters books, it certainly made a good impression on me. The book kept me interested and always waiting for more. The charters were well introduced and made the plot more interesting. What seems to be a book only about immigration turns out to be a mix of immigration and satanical rituals that seem to be going on in the town, which turn out to be practical jokes. Jokes, that happen to get out of hand and turn a town upside down. The author John Welter does a great job of introducing characters and a great job of making the book flow smoothly from scene to scene. I give this book four stars, and would recommend this book to everyone and especially to the people that don't like to read books, because this book would keep anyone interested with its humor."
