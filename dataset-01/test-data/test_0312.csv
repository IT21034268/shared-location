2,Oh dear...,"High hopes for this one were dashed by a awfully weak plot. Cruise is not too bad and holds his character well, along with fairly decent acting from his co-actors. But Acting is not the downfall of this film. It is fair to say that people who will watch this will be the Action/Adventure james Bond watchers. But this is not James Bond. Action/Adventure, barely. There are some impressive special effects which go someway to mask the poor plot line, but it eventually shines through. The use of the Rubber Face-Masks to confuse the enemy is done 10 times too many. Watch the original, or any James Bond movie instead of this."
1,Very Poor Sequel,"This has to be one of John Woo's poorest offerings to date, and his trademark scenes are becoming ever more repetetive in successive films. Perhaps the abundance of hype surrounding the cinematic release of this movie, really didn't do it any favours, as it never lived up to expectations. The sad fact is that a talented ensemble cast and great SFX, have been nullified by a storyline that could have been written on the back of a stamp. Even the super quality of DVD, the sexy Nyah, torrid chase and action scenes can't save this movie from a lame script. Not half as good as the first movie, which in itself was something of a disappointment."
2,Should have done a video clip instead,"This movie is ridiculous. I went to see it because of the good reviews it had when it opened in theatres, and because of the theatrical trailer I had seen. But that was it. This would have been a good piece of work for a five minutes video-clip, with the music, Tom Cruise's hair blowing in the wind while flying with his motorcycle, and the excellent cinematography and slow motion sequences. But a movie based on that? Come on. It is a shame, because I was begining to respect Tom Cruise's career as an actor, with some great films he made."
3,What the?,"After seeing the movie in the theaters I thought it was much better than the first, it is but only in the action category. It was full of action, and though I find the racing bike scene a little too far fetched for Tom Cruise or any person to whip a bike around the way he did. I did find the scene where he used the bike's rear view mirror to aim his gun and fire behind him something original and unique.But John Woo needs to A. stop using two guns in every movie, B. stop having the characters diving in mid air while they fire both of those guns in every movie, and C. don't use a wash out overrated actor like Tom Cruise for an action flick. Even Arnold at his old age does far better than Tom Cruise.After seeing it at first at the movies I gave it five stars; after seeing it at home and after reconsidering the pros and cons it sinks to three stars."
3,Its alright,M:I2 is a very impressive movie but the sequences and the plot are all so very simple...boy meets girl..boy falls in love with girl..viceversa..bad guy enters..boy protects girl.. Simple...
4,It's a great movie!,"I really like action movies. I wasn't very excited about this movie, as Mission Impossible 1 was very bad, very bored. But, when I saw this movie, I was really impressed. I really like it a lot, I will certainly watch it again."
2,Sigh!!,"You don't have to make a good movie to earn money. A cool trailor is all you need! After so long I still can't overcome from the anger of being cheated (for both money and time). The movie is completely drowned by John Woo's ego of "" to show some cool stuff to those corny viewers""."
4,Action,"I have read other reviews on this film I really like it for Its action and thrills, and Tom was not bad to look at. He surely was my eye candy. I know it did not stay with the orig. but this is a new day and time. The only thing I would have like to see would been more agents with him like in the orig. But I guess we can't have everything. But boy, was he fine fine .... I would take a car ride with him."
4,"Good, could be better (though it may be impossible)","I enjoyed Mission: Impossible 2 a lot. The plot was good, there were many surprises, the action was well set, the script was good, the chick was hot, and the soundtrack is my absolute favorite I have heard. The one thing which I think could be better was Tom Cruise. Sure, he is good for action and all the girls think he is good looking. But, he is just not like the original series actors. Such as, when he got the surprise rocket in the beginning, he didn't treat it like it was anything. I think he should have been really surprised, much more than he was. And later, when he was told to go in to the building with the time locked door plates, he took it the wrong way. He should have been more afraid yet cool of the idea, instead of, ""Sure, I can."" Beyond that, it was a great movie."
5,Great Movie,"Bought this for my son, but enjoyed watching it as much as he did! The story was amazing and the acting was great!"
2,fails the trade descriptions act..,"..which is a statute we have in the U.K., no doubt you have something similar.The main thing to say about MI2 is that, like the first one, it isn't a Mission Impossible story. Mission Impossible, to me, is a caper story, premised on impossible, or at least highly unfeasible missions, carried out by a team. This film, like the first one (which starts by wiping out the team almost as soon as they've been established with the viewer) has a couple of fairly bland henchmen with gadgets and that's all. A film almost entirely about Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's chiselled features, death-defying acrobatics and intrepid duelling with the chief villain, whatever its own merits, is simply not true to the premise of (or what was so good about) the show we remember from way back when. So don't call it Mission Impossible. Call it the Man With The Golden Grin."
2,The Horror! The Horror!,"Well, for one thing, this was one of the worst movies of 2000. The only things that were worse were Mission to Mars, Battlefield Earth, and Red Planet. John Woo should've just tried to remake The Matrix than make this."
1,not even a guilty pleasure,"Wow. Amazing. I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was. There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's ""relationship."" I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought ""action"" sequences. And I know this because I heard them HOWL when Cruise emoted his laughable dialogue to Newton before parachuting from inside of the building.A real triumph in bad movie making. Bravo Mr. Woo!!"
3,30 Minutes Scattered in 2 Hours,Wow... incredible they made MI3 after watching this one. A bare shell of MI1. 30 minutes of entertaining action and film (which does not include Cruise playing Chuck Norse) scattered into 2 hours and 4 minutes. Cruise and the others must have been getting paid by the minute. Don't be afraid to use the fast forward when watching this one. I gave the film an extra star because when there is good action and film its worth watching.
1,Sequel Impossible,"The first Mission Impossible was a great movie, it rocked.. for some reason, someone thought that it would be a great idea to try and make another fortune off of our misfortune and create a sequel.. doesnt anyone in hollywood know that sequels by definition SUCK!!! this one was definitelyt no exception to the rule.. with lame dialogue, horrible plot, terrible acting, and yet another tom cruise look at me i am so beautifulk ego trip, this movie lacked in every category.. the one thing that saved this movie from being a complete and total waste of time and effort was dougray Scott..,.. I never would have been able to see him as a villian until i saw it.. seeing was believing in this film.. otherwise, dont waste your time.."
1,Save the planet - Don't buy this film !,"C'mon John Woo, what's that ? The movie opens with a 15 minutes cheesy romance between Agent Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), with a lot of slow-mo sequences where the two lovers look at each other in the eyes... Unbearable and absolutly not credible !Then you have the usual fight between the bad-guy-who-wants-to-kill-everyone-and-become-the-richest-man-on-the-planet and the good-guy-who-wants-to-stop-the-bad-guy. And guess what ? In the end, the good guy beats the bad guy ! Been there a 1000 times. Done that. Bought the t-shirt, thank you very much.I thought that the De Palma movie sucked big time but this one is even worse. Where has the magic of the original serie gone ? Poor screenplay. Poor acting.Really can't wait to see MI3, MI4 and MI12 !What an incredible lost of time and money."
1,Lame,"I can't believe what they've done to MI TV serie. This movie has nothing to do with the spirit of ""a team"" trying to make the impossible possible. This one should be renamed ""Tom Cruise, Me myself and I"".The video I rented had an interview about the making of the movie. My favorite quote from Tom: ""I like the richness of the dialogue in this movie."". Says a lot about the guy. All along I thought there was more to him than just a pretty face, I guess I was wrong. Skip it!"
3,"Not the Best, But Still Fun to Watch","In the second installment of the Mission Impossible series director John Woo takes the ropes and gives true action fans what they deserve. Everything is here. All the true and fun stunts and an interesting twist to add a love story into the mix. Most people that I have talked to have said that it was too unbelievable and stupid to even watch. But what can you expect with the title Mission Impossible? I expected impossible stunts and I have to say that I got what I wanted. Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames return to the film, followed by the evil Dougray Scott (Ever After). I have to say if you're in the mood for a good action flick, and you love John Woo. Why don't you pick up a copy of MI:2 and sit and enjoy."
2,M:I 2 was an unnecessary sequel,"Did this movie really tell much of a story? Does it remind anyone of the old show? The first one from 1996 was one of the more suspenseful movies of the 90s, and the second one is ridiculously stupid. What was with this face mask garbage? Nobody was anybody. Everybody had someone elses' face on and spoke in their voice. It got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. It ruined the movie. It was so unrealistic. A few of the action sequences were good at the end, but the first hour and a half is so boring and undeveloping, nothing can save it. THE MUSIC WAS BAD."
1,suckville,"Don't buy this movie, it's terrible. It doesn't get going at all until too late and the ending is boring, the plot sucks, the characters are weak, and Woo went wrong. Buy Face/Off if you want some cool flick, not this trash. People who liked it will hate it when they get older and see better movies, they'll wonder what they were thinking with these good reviews, Goldeneye, or Face/Off instead."
3,Only had a few good bits...,"Cool motorcycle scene, and a few other bits. Overall - predictable and kinda silly"
1,Not even a good DVD,"I bought this knowing the plot might be suspect, which it is, but the effects aren't even that good. I bought U-571 at the same time, and it provided a stark contrast. It's effects were outstanding while MI2's were generally unimpressive. All around - the movie sucked. Don't buy it."
3,A bit slow in places,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the new Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol movie in the theater. We decided to go back and watch the older MI movies. The first was a okay, but a bit convoluted. The second was better but kind of slow in several places. The third really picked up the pace and was quite enjoyable. Overall, this trilogy was worth buying."
2,"compared to the first one, this stinks","Boy was I disappointed with this film. While the first one was a wonderfully dense and relatively believable tale that could be viewed over and over for that little extra detail, this sequel just makes a one-dimensional superhero of Cruise. You can't suspend your disbelief with this one as the plot is outlandish and Cruise can't do all the things that his character does. There is no psychological depth, right down to the chick he conquers who also happens to be an integral part of the plot.Recommended as throw-away entertainment only."
3,"Good action movie, wrong idea...","Mission Impossible, based on the TV series, should be about a team of spies destroying or an organization or government. Both MI1 and MI2 are not even close. The first one was a major disapointment when Jim turned out to be a bad guy (??). What is this deal about the bad guys also wearing mask...MI-2 is sort of like a ""James Bond"" sequence. I hope the producers will sit down a watch the original series again, before making a third MI will be done more properly."
3,Great Sequel,"I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, so I'm a little biased, but I like this movie. It's nothing that will make you think too much, just Tom Cruise blowing stuff up, wearing masks and pulling off incredible martial arts moves.A little predictable, but fun and worth owning."
1,A Poor Sequel,"If you liked the original MI movie, congratulations. So did I. While it was a departure from the series in that there was little real focus on the team dynamics so prevalant on television, it was a fun, entertaining, realistic action flick with some great actors. MI:2 has none of these qualities. The plot again deals with a renegade IMF agent (must be those post-Cold War budget cuts!) who hides in plain sight. The technology is completely implausible, the plot is nonexistent, and the characters are poorly developed. (If you thought the characters in the first MI lacked depth, wait till you see MI:2). Tom Cruise continues what I see as the downward spiral of his career as of late, appearing in bad film after bad film. He has apparently forgotten how to act in a good action movie, and John Woo has forgotten how to direct one--sad to see such a brilliant pair decline to rapidly, and succumb to the pressure to create another box-office, but not critical, success."
2,One neuron short of a passing thought,"Very little can be said about this movie. Don't waste your time with purchasing it. It may be worth wasting $4. on a rental, but thats it! This movie was dull,un-interesting, bland, a travesty of all that is holy in action films. Yes there was a time when an action film had a good story. These days all we get are cartoon special effects, bad acting, (Who the hell like's Cruise anyway?)and witty one liners my eight year brother thinks are funny. No amount of special features on these discs can be even a little consolation. I only gave it two stars because it made me laugh at how bad a movie can be."
1,Israeli Stuff Moni made up.,"OK another Moni offering. As usual visually stunning, well produced and attractive to watch. Here'es the rub. It is NOT Krav Maga, its Monis own system and its NOT taught to the Israeli military. I believe Moni has now retracted these claims but these are what sells the DVD..That is important to understand because if you think you are buying a military combatives DVD or a Krav Maga DVD you are not. If you are looking for some interesting techniques that Moni has adapted from other systems then this could be an interesting buy."
2,Krav Magoo,Pretty much you're standard DVD of Krav Maga. You are shown a few moves over and over. Just the basics. You can learn from them but you have to have a partner to work with.
1,Zyliss Rotary Grater with Fine Drum,"Absolutely the worst, the cheese gets hard inside the small little drum and then the wheel tightens so hard that the handle breaks. But I did get at least an ounce of cheese before that happened. The floor and my dogs got the other few ounces when I was trying to turn the damn thing. If I paid a dollar, I would have been equally upset."
4,Fun & Original,"I was recommended this album by a friend and was pleasantly surprised overall.IC Timer kicks things off with its frenetic pace and absurd lyrics. Definitely one of my favorite singles by these guys. Asleepers Union slows things down to a crawl initially, but picks up steam as its meandering arpeggio guitar finally condenses into chords near the end of the song. In These Woods is generally unremarkable, though by no means bad. Hide Me From Next February is another standout for me, with its shrieking guitar and chugging bass. Finally, Rome finishes strong with the lead singer rambling over dissonant guitar (in fact, this sums up the band as a whole quite well).Finally, I'd like to point out $7.99 for a 5 track album is a bit overkill... though I cannot fault the band for this."
5,The album that has started my Les Savy Fav love affair,"This is the first Les Savy Fav album that I bought and now I'm a huge fan. In my opinion, although there are only a limited amount of songs to listen to on this cd, they are all great. The vocals on 'Hide Me From Next February' are my favorite to date. Buy this album, you've only got five tracks to lose."
1,Book: A Big Mistake,"I purchased this book to enhance my knowledge of Pro/E. I have been using Pro/E for over 6 years. Purchasing this book was a big mistake and a waste of my time. This book is very second-rate. The instructions and procedures in each chapter are not clear, correct nor complete. The quality of the illustrations are poor. It looks like the book was produced on a copier machine.Toogood assumes that the reader knows everything. If this was true, why would anyone buy a book to read and learn from. This book was a big mistake. It now holds my coffee in the morning."
3,Decent material with needs for improvements,"This book can be helpful, you just need to find some patience. The instructions are certainly not the clearest and vague most of the time. However, it makes you think and figure out on your own. Therefore, do not expect everything to be spelled out for you. I would recommend to obtain a used copy of the book."
2,sony 828,"This is the new replacement for Sony' venerable 717. I bought it and sadly had to return it. while the feature set is great and the resolution is very good, there is terrible ""purple fringing"" in a majority of pictures which ruins the image quality.( see dpreview.com for their excellent review) From reading experiences in the photo forums, it seems that this is inherent in all the 828's. It seems that by cramming 8mp on to a small sensor, they went too far and the result is the ugly purple fringing. Can it be processed out with photoshop? sure, but who wants to do that with EVERY picture. I end up buying the Minolta A1 and am quite happy with it It produces excellent image quality, and has even more features than the 828. If you want a Sony, get the 717 model- its really good"
2,"Purple fringing, high noise","Read the professional reviews of this camera before buying. Compared to similar cameras, the F828 produces images with higher levels of noise (the digital equivalent of film grain) as well as chromatic aberration (purple fringes) in bright areas such as reflections, backlit objects, etc. I, too, decided to return mine...the nifty features and the price/lens combo don't make up for the comparatively poor image quality."
2,"nice idea, poor execution","I am returning my copy. Content is nice, but someone was NOT thinking in the design of this book. It is sized to fit in a purse or tote, but it is a hardback. The very narrow size and the binding preclude the book being ""interactive"", since in order to write in it, (or even to read it) one must virtually crack the binding to open it flat. A spiral binding would have made much more sense. and wider pages would be much easier to write on."
5,How did I miss this one!!,"I don't know how this get by me. I recently checked out their videos on YouTube. Immediately, I purchased the cd and it is getting constant rotation on the player. The opening track sets the tone for the rest of the cd. This is a solid metal release from Slik Toxik. Every track is a winner; no fillers in my opnion. So glad I bought it. It probably is out of print, but I say ""get this gem"" if you don't already have it. Don't let it go or sell it. This is a for any listener of the first two releases from Skid Row, or bands like Wildside, Spread Eagle etc."
3,A little dull,"I am the parent of a 6-year-old who has just become infatuated with panda bears. We got this book because he likes both fiction and non-fiction books about pandas. This book does not rhyme, although the text is written in a prose-like fashion as if it should. There are quotation marks around every sentence, but there are 6 characters in the book, and the author never actually tells you who is saying what, which makes it difficult to ""dramatize"" your reading.The story is of six friends who decide their tree house is decrepit, and so they set out to find a tree for their new club house. They try several, find the perfect one, then set out to build the new club house. Each friend has a task but one, until he finally realizes that their club sign has been left at the old tree house and makes that his job, to retrieve it.This book is not horrendous, but having the two different and disparate themes (finding a new tree, and having a job building it) makes it a bit scattered and dull."
4,Hitman in The Hand of Buddha,One of the best movies of Hwang Jang Lee. The master of kicks displays his talents against a wide range of opponents and disposes of them in a violent way. All the killer techniques are choreographed in detail.
3,Disappointed in the Sound,"Looks like I'm the only one who didn't think this disc was so great. I looked forward to this Blu Ray version of a movie I love. I was there. I even owned a white 1958 Chevy Impala like Steve's. What I was looking for was improved HD video crispness (that did happen) and improved sound for all of that wonderful old music. No dice. I have an excellent home theater setup which handles BluRay discs with surround sound in Dolby TruHD and DTS Master Audio with great aplomb. A state of the art BluRay disc has wonderful sound! Not the case here. The sound was sort of muffled, voices not clear, and when volume raised enough to hear the voices the music was too loud, etc. Certainly not modern BluRay disc standard. Really no better than my 2005 DVD version of this movie. Yes, the visuals were marginally better, but the sound really does not do justice to this great old classic. I sort of feel ripped-off by the hype of this new release."
4,movie,I bought this movie because it had been years since I saw it and my son had never seen it. We enjoyed it. Quality wasn't great nor sound but what can you expect from an old movie.
1,Lucas' best film.,"'American Graffiti' is easily George Lucas' best film. Not because of poor direction verging on the sloppy, killing any momentum with inept editing and boring compositions. Not because of a leaden script with no sense of structure, that prevents some decent actors from even thinking about characterisation, and which places the burden of period atmosphere and emotional resonance on the soundtrack. Not because of Lucas' usual preference for machines over people, or his misguided assumption that a string of tedious anecdotes makes a compelling, 'real' and nationally symbolic story. No. 'American Graffiti' is George Lucas' best film because it is 11 minutes shorter than 'Star Wars'."
4,Good movie,"I saw this movie when I was a teen and after all these years, it's still a feel good movie. I highly recommend it."
3,American Graffiti,"I didn't care for this movie too much. It might be ok for teenagers but I doubt today's teenager would relate, it may seem kind of nerdy to them."
2,Adequate but not polished,"This phone works as claimed, but has rough edges that left me unimpressed. The speakerphone (even with Mute on) has minor dropouts, seemingly at loud points, as if the amplifier circuit is underpowered. The handset also has dropouts, at random points (even during silence) - these are minor and won't interfere with conversation, but are annoying. The signal on the headset is also very noisy; for comparison an older Sony 900 MHz DSS phone has much less noise and equal clarity. This phone works fairly well with the Plantronics M175 headset, though mic sensitivity could be better. Speakerphone sensitivity also could be better."
5,A Detailed Study of the Life of Lions,"Excellent work by George Schaller. He Takes an intimate look at almost every aspect of lion behavior and social dynamics. From hunting behavior to a lionesses motherly love of her cubs, he takes you into their realm. Schaller gives you a detailed scientific look into what is happening in the life of lions and their world. He backs up his judgements with his own research and the research of others. A must read for any lion enthusiast."
1,"1"" brad nail review","I give this 1-star because I think they are good brads, but they arrived in the packaging as single pieces instead of strips. The packaging was terrible. It was a brown envelope with very little cushioning and must have been crushed and thrown around. There wasn't a single strip intact ."
4,Simple and Fun,We liked it. It was enjoyed by all my kids from 4 to 8. The actors and songs were great for before and after our visit to the farm.
5,Two Generations Loving This Video,"When my daughter was a toddler this was her favorite tape (yes, vcr, lol). She watched it all the time and really loved singing along. I was so happy to find it on DVD and couldn't wait to play it for my 18 mo. old grandson. He's a little too young to sing along yet but he loves it too! He was very entertained and was clapping, dancing and making the animal sounds. I'm very happy with this DVD!"
4,Great video,My daughter (now 18-months old) got this video when she was 12 months old. She loves it and even now watches it atleast once or twice a week.
2,"Power Stone alike, but worst","I got this in a trade, after reading 7 of the mangas that are out, I heard great comments on this game and wanted to try it myself... after seen all the characters the screen offered I wanted to see all the supers, first the short ones, after I discovered that if I found a stone I could make the super longer... but unfortunatly its not all about supers, the combos are very easy too perform.For those fans of power stone I recommend you get the dreamcast version instead of this one... the challenges are quite difficult... and it gets boring after repeating the same combo once and again...I thought Monkey D. Luff would be a much better game... hoping for something more Budokai alike... obviously not that strong, but as good as that one."
3,Great ... except for the projection,"I loved this clock and was so excited to have the projection feature (which was the whole reason for buying the device in the first place). But after now being on my 3rd clock (after the projection feature on the first two pooped out after about a year), I think I'll move on to another brand. Too bad...so sad."
2,2 OUT OF 6?,"Sorry, but we originally purchased one for ourselves we loved it and still do! So we ordered 6 more for Christmas gifts. Everyone loved their gift, and they were great for maybe one month, then one by one the LED would go out. Something we loved, turned out to be a bummer gift! Out of the 6 purchased, 2 are still working."
5,Projection Not Too Bright,"The first few clocks I bought were way too bright. This one is perfect. I did buy mine at Target, but it is the same clock. It sets itself! All I had to do was make sure the time zone was correct. What a feature. When I took it out of the box, it even felt like a well engineered appliance having some weight to it. You will not be disappointed with this one."
5,Just perfect!,This product has met and surpassed my expectations. The projection is very clear and visible.You won't have any hassles about this clock.
4,"Great value, good clock","Had this for a couple of months and so far so good. Extremely easy setup, just plug it in and it sets the date and time for you within a few seconds. It does seem to be about 2 minutes fast but who cares. I love the projection on the ceiling. The arm swivels and has a focus knob on the top so you can place it pretty much anywhere. It is perfectly clear and easy to read. Having two separate alarms have come in handy and my wife and I often get up at different times. The shut off's are in the back and you need to feel around a bit to find them but once you get used to it then it is no problem. Hope it keeps working because I like it."
5,greatest ever clock,"smart clock is just that, sets itself for time and date, and the projection of time on the ceiling was great, for seeing the time in bed. great."
4,nice value,"I ordered this for my daughter to use at college. The dual alarm is nice because she can set one for her MWF schedule and the other for her TR schedule. The only drawback is that the alarm gets louder and louder. A good feature for some people but not for her. It takes her a while to wake and turn it off and by then it's so loud it wakes up her roommate too. The projection works well though, and is a good size and clear."
2,Loved it until it quit after a few months.,"I LOVED this alarm--it is so easy to use and I enjoyed the projection feature, but, after only four-five months, it just quit working. I tried changing the back-up battery, but, like many other reviewers, I could not get it to work again.I've never had an electric alarm clock quit on me so I'm frustrated that the warranty is only 90 days or I would try to have it repaired. From the other reviews, it looks like there are a lot of us who are having similar problems with this clock just quitting for no reason after a few months. If you don't mind replacing your alarm clock every 2-3 years, its still a great clock, but I'm going to look for a different brand since I don't want to spend the time and money going through this every few months."
3,Nice....but,"Really nice clock, sets itself! Dual alarms are nice, but cumbersome to turn off and on if you can't see the back easily. My first one died after a month, but the second once seems to be working well."
1,Low Quality,"The projector died - now it will not turn off, but what it projects is gibberish. The radio gets terrible reception - no matter where I turn the dial I get interference from the same station. Other radios in the room don't have that problem. Too bad, it's a nice enough design."
1,very poor product,"product appeared to be new when received. the internal battery was dead. after plugging it in, it appeared to work okay, but only lasted about 8 hours before failing. I will not purchase this type of product from here in the future."
4,Great clock and I love the projection on the ceiling,I've had several projection clocks and this is the best one yet. The ceiling display is huge (almost funny). The clock set itself to the correct time instantly (after a slight time zone adjustment) and with the battery backup even kept the correct time after a power failure.I only wish it had a remote temperature sensor.
3,Bodhran skin needs a shave,The construction of this Bodhran seems solid. It comes with a suitable tipper and allen wrench for tuning. I was suprised to see how the skin looked. It is very blotchy and much of it is translucent (see through). There is visable stubble over parts of the skin. I don't know enough about these drums to say much more but I've never seen a skin quite like this before.
5,good work,Keep on putting Mr. Davison's work on dvd. The scripting template is a perfect match for him. His partner and dawg are perfect.
5,A wonderful scanner,"I use this with my Apple G5 computer with the SilverFast software. I bought it to scan my large collection of 35mm, medium format (645 and 6x7) and 4x5 negatives. I found the software and computer very easy to set up and run with Adobe Photoshop or just by itself. Scanning at very high resoltions gives me print quality equal to what I can get printing the negatives in the darkroom and printing out to sizes 23x 30 inches with superb quality."
2,poor music production,The music was too loud to hear the lyrics. I kinda had to block it out when my son watched it. I dont think he liked it either because he didnt watch it again!... like he does with his Baby Songs dvds! Baby songs are written well and my whole family gets the songs in our head. Cant go wrong with Baby Songs !
1,"cars, boats, trains and Planes",This much different than the previous 4 DVD I purchased. It has way to much talking and repeats songs from the other 4 DVD that I purchased.
2,"Very steep learning curve, mediocre results for now","No doubt, there are some amazing pictures people took with this CCD. But if you have no experience with astrophotography, plan to spend many, many hours before you'll get anything reasonable, and pretty much forget taking pictures of moon / planets (in all fairness, it is a Deep Space Imager...). Meade does a very poor job of explaining what some of the controls do (histogram, offset - you can slide them around but what do they actually do? Don't ask the manual). Focusing is still a problem (despite a software focusing assist included - it's pretty much useless). In addition the camera does really poorly in high contrast situations. All in all, it's too late for me to send it back which I'm really sorry about - I kept it too long trying to master it, now I guess I have to :-)"
1,Terrible book,"Unless you are already well versed in the topic of Armenian art, do not get this book. Every page it mentions about 20 names, and it only tells you who about half of those people are. It quickly jumps from topic to topic, making it difficult to follow. Finally, the language that it uses is extremely difficult to understand, both the vocabulary and sentence structure. There are other boooks out there, and they must be better. Pass on this one."
3,It's OK...,"I came across Carlyle after reading Mary Balogh's book. To be honest, i was captivated with her writing, the author writes flawlessly. The character though.. i feel she should give more background to Freddie's character, and less emphasis on Bentley's depression. More depth on the character, please!Overall, quite a nice book."
5,they are not dead..a glory come back,a real true simple minds come back with true simple minds music.A miracle has happened.
3,It works well despite Spanish version of Manual,"I received the product with the Spanish version of the manual. It took me a while to figure out the installation/operation due to my limited Spanish. I went to the Memorex website to try and download the English version of the manual, but I couldn't find the product in their product listing despite many searches. I still don't have the English version of the manual, but I've figured out the basic operation of the VCR."
2,Wish I liked it more,"I really wanted to like this item! Pro's: Very solid, straight forward assembly. Con's: Limited hand positions, assist pad moves at a weird angle vs straight up and down, dip handles are very wide."
4,Quick read!,"I, too, enjoyed this book. I was less putoff by the author than other reviewers although I can certainly understand some of their points. Still, he's a father looking out for his son and, well, I guess I could understand the lengths he went to help and protect his son during the recruiting process. By the end I was really pulling for the kid to do well and I was anxious to read his decision. You really can't ask for more from a Sunday afternoon read. I had wished for a different ending but, hey, it's not my life!"
2,Decent Read,"The title is misleading when it says ""Big Time Football Recruiting"". The player the book was about did not have many D1 offers and showed up at a few schools to visit the campus ans the coaches had never heard of him.Great story about a kid and his dad, but not very informative in regards to a look behind the scenes in football recruiting."
5,Magnum P.I. Season 1,"Being a Magnum P.I. fan (Tom Selleck) as well as a fan of the other characters and actors on the show, I was thrilled when I finally was able to start collecting my series. I am slowly watching the series and enjoying recapturing the thrills of watching them. I am slowly going to get all of them as I can. There is so much more to see than I remember from watching them on t.v. Any real fan would be thrilled with the chance to own and watch at their convenience."
2,BAD QAULITY,If you get season 1 be sure to check the first disk side B to look for scratches. This will seriously interupt play for you miss 2-3 scenes. Perhaps the cheaper price is a hint for the poor quality.
5,Great from the beginning...,"Often times new TV series start out a little weak and eventually pick up steam. I'd say this was the case with shows like the X-Files, Star Trek TNG, and even Seinfeld. Magnum PI started out strong from the very beginning and stayed strong throughout most of the life of the series.Even the first episode draws upon Magnum's ties to Vietnam, a theme that was continued throughout the series and made the show fascinating. Magnum's buddies Rick and TC are there from the start, as is the love/hate relationship between the three of them. And of course there is Higgins, Magnum's arch-rival and delightful comic relief.This show is an absolute delight to watch. I thought after growing up with it as a teenager it might have lost some of its luster in the 21st century, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it had not. It holds up incredibly well even by today's standards, and remains, in my opinion, the best PI TV series ever made."
4,Excellent entertainment - spotty transfer,"This is one of my two all-time favorite TV series. Despite some changes in costume and hair style, the series has stood the test of time surprisingly well. The ensemble cast each bring a well-developed character to the screen from episode 1. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the episodes in order and fully intend to buy the rest of the seasons. I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if possible. The only ding is that the transfer quality was poor in places. This series definitely merits remastering. I had hoped that this would be done for the DVD, having noticed that this poor resolution occurs occasionally in the re-runs broadcast on television as well. It isn't terrible, but not as good as the show deserves either."
5,About the reviews!,"To the two reviewers below who are all bent out of shape over the rest of the reviews here--get a grip! Isn't it obvious that the reviews so far are about the show and how happy the fans are that it's being released on DVD? Is there anything wrong with that? Anyway, can't wait until Tuesday and glad to see that others are looking forward to this release too! Oh, the five stars are for the show, just in case anyone else can't understand that!"
4,EB for Magnum PI,"The shows were of fine quality. However, the double-sided disk format was hard to follow and a bit difficult for my Mom to figure out. Also, one must always press ""menu"" to escape the preview adds."
2,I was NOT feeling this...,"counting is probably the only poem i really like...i'm not a big fan of slam poetry...her stuff might sound good if it was read in public with a band behind her,but i just couldn't get into it...."
4,Good value,This machine easily makes good espresso with consistently nice crema. Frothing milk is a bit trickier because of the trial and error involved in getting sufficient steam. Still it's good value for the price.
3,Doctor Dogbody's Leg,Sea tale larded with oceangoing jargon that will satisfy both the armchair salt and his real-life counterpart.
3,A Fairly Good Album All Around,"This album is considered by many to be a seminal hit in the hard rock genre. And it is a fairly good representation of that genre in many ways. The fact that it is actually two albums means you get a lot of bang for your buck and there are several songs on here with great lyrics and an interesting sound like ""Johnny Hit And Run Pauline"" I guess the reason I only give this three stars though is it never really grew on me. There are some nice lyrics and some nice music but by the end it all just blends together and nothing really stands out. In many ways this could be the ideal background music to a hypertwisted movie about LA especially if it was one of those Gen X growing up type movies, but for whatever reason I just don't find myself coming back to this album very much."
5,Great sight and good price,I love this sight. I like the AA battery because it is easy to find replacements anywhere. I have it on a home defense carbine and will use it for multi-gun completitions.
1,Usury!,"Right now some seller is listing this model of the habitat for $129.--, which is absurd and abusive. It's original price was around $20.00 This model is in short supply, but only because the toy producer (Summit, I think) has a new model of the habitat. The new model at around $20.00 is great, but please don't let yourself get ripped off at the $129 price. The seller selling the toy at that price should be ashamed.I am not actually saying that this toy is bad, but please don't pay $129 for it!-- There is a new version of it!"
4,Mario Lemieux is god!,"Mario Lemieux is one of the best hockey players to ever grace the ice. He was the Pittsburgh Pengiuns' best player for many years. This book gave many highlights of his career and gave insight to his personal life, one thing no other book has done. He is considered to be one of the NHL's greatest players of all time. This book is a must have for every Lemieux fan, and for every person that follows hockey."
3,"Big toy, watch out for the rubber if you dog is a heavy chewer.","I bought this toy to keep my heavy chewing german shepherd busy. It worked great until he spent some time on the rubber ""teeth"" in the middle. If you dog tries hard enough, he will be able to rip the rubber apart and leave it on your floor for you. I still use the toy, but only when I can monitor. Once he gets going on the rubber, I take it away."
2,Good in Theory,"I got this thinking I could feel a bit better for not brushing his teeth one day (Alaskan Malamute 8 mo.), but my dog is a very aggressive chewer and this didn't last 1 minute with him. The blue nibs that ""clean"" teeth came off instantly and he ended up swallowing them. I mean not just little individual nibs, but they came off in groups of 3 and were pretty chewed off. If you don't want your dog it ingest this stuff, don't get it. Especially if your dog is very aggressive chew AND has a habit of eating random stuff."
4,Harmonica blues-one of the best,"This is one of the best harmonica blues albums I have found. Some of the song lyrics are suggestive. Favorite track is #9- ""That Spot Right There"". This is one CD that will be played and not forgotten."
3,Good for working in a cubical setting,"The RS100 Wireless Headphones have been a great and affordable solution to my issue of having my music headphones tied to a cord while at work. I enjoy the freedom of moving around my cube and office without missing my favorite talk or music.On the downside, the headphone design is not the greatest. The set does tend to slide around a little, the quality of material is only satisfactory, and the sound quality isn't to a level of a Bose. However for the price you are paying this has been a nice addition to my work day."
2,Not that great,"I bought these headphones as I was troubled by the constant snagging of headphone wires with something or the other on my desk. I could not resist having a wireless pair of headphones that would (finally) give me the freedom of reaching for something without almost snapping the headphone cord. Alas, the dream was just a dream. The headphone is of course wireless, and even looks somewhat cool but that's where its usefulness stops. The sound quality was poor to extremely poor depending on how far I moved from the base station. Mind you, the maximum I must have moved was probably some 20 feet and I could already hear crackling in the sound. As ridiculously inane as it sounds, for me the most important thing in a headphone is the sound quality. I am willing to put up with a wired (and consequently, clumsy desktop accidents) headphone set just for the sound quality. Do not buy these!!"
3,Get a sling instead,"I've tried to use the carrier since my son was 3 months old. He didn't like it especially facing toward me, he couldn't see anything and was stuck just staring at my shirt (Convenient for me, but no fun for him) I tried him facing out at 5 months, and he was ok, but not real thrilled with it. It's very difficult to hook up, you almost need two people to figure out how to get it on, not to mention putting the baby in it. I tried a simple over the shoulder sling from Target, and he absolutely adores it. He can walk around with me while I do chores at the same time. He absolutely loves it, and it was not much more (...). The bjorn made my back hurt, whereas the sling can be positioned so that it doesn't hurt your back or your shoulders- I would recommend trying the sling (you can always return it)before you invest in this (...) gizmo."
3,ok-depends on the time of the year your baby is born,"i loved this in the summer for the first months that my daughter was born. but as winter hit, didn't use it as much. didn't get the money's worth. now that it is spring again, she doesn't love it as much as the backpack carrier we have."
3,Great quality...but never used it!,"This product is really well made; However, I'm not sure why, but my husband and I have always found it to be a little more trouble than it's worth...I guess we are in the minority!The carrier is great and definitely better than the less expensive ones, but we have just never found a big use for it. Our daughter is not patient, so by the time we get her in the thing she is sometimes upset and wants to get out.We have only really used it once that it came in really handy and our baby is already 16 pounds. She is super heavy in it too - although admittedly lighter than carrying her in our arms.So, although I would agree that is is high quality, really evaluate whether you'll use it before spending $90. We thought it was a ""must have"", but I would not put in anywhere near that category now (for us at least)."
4,It was good while it lasted...,"We registered for and received this version of the Baby Bjorn. We started using the carrier when our now 5 month old son met the weight recommendation. It was a saving grace for me, as it allowed me many days of getting things done around the house when he just did not want to be put down.He is now almost 20 lbs. and since throwing out my back last month, I can not carry him around in it for long periods of time. Even my husband, a much bigger person than my own 5 ft. frame, gets tired of carrying our ""little big guy"" around in it.Although it's recommended through to a heavier weight, I think it's time to hang up the Baby Bjorn. I'm a little sad about it since I really enjoyed the closeness while carrying him. It was good while it lasted, although we didn't get to use it as long as we would have liked, that's why it's receiving only four stars."
4,Great For City Babies,"This product is well designed, and easy to use. I felt my baby was very secure in this. Living in a metropolitan area, I rely heavily on the subway system. Putting my baby in this carrier, made traveling in the city a lot easier. You don't have to lug around car seats and strollers (on top of everything else you have to bring). I used this product for the first 3 months. My baby would nap in it, while I ran errands. But after 3 months, when my son weighed about 15 lbs., it became uncomfortable for me to carry him in this. Just too heavy. It was fine for my husband, though. This is a nice item to have, as long as you know that you'll probably only be using it for the first few months. It's pricey, so try to borrow one from a friend,(as long as the carrier is not more than 2 or 3 years old) if you can."
4,Can't live without it,"I've been using this product since my daughter was 3 weeks old. She is now 4 1/2 months and I still love it. Instead of waiting until she is asleep to do housework, I just take her along for the ride and save nap time for more enjoyable activities. I NEVER leave home without it. During those fussing hours in the evening, nothing calmed her down like being put in her Baby Bjorn and Mommy dancing to music. My only complaint with the product would be the top two buttons. They can be difficult to do up with only one hand."
5,Absolutely love it!,I don't know why I'm bothering to write this review--there are so many others that say the same thing. But I love this carrier. I bought a Snugli because I just couldn't understand how big the difference could be. My son hated the Snugli as a newborn and he just tolerated it when he could face out; he never did seem very comfortable or well-supported in it. So I finally got a Bjorn because he's just too heavy to carry around and I am so glad I spent the money for it. No kidding--my son was laughing and kicking his feet within seconds of being strapped in. He loves being in it. I really like that his arms can be free to move about when the headrest is secured under them. He still feels secure and he has a lot more freedom to move. This is a great buy and should be one of those items that you just go ahead and splurge on. No shortcuts here--this product is great!
3,"Maybe Yes, Maybe No","I agree with all the other responses - great carrier for the under-20-pounder. My son is 7+ months old and 20lb, and while he seems comfy enough in the Baby Bjorn, I've noticed that it seems to cut off circulation in his chubby legs - his feet were turning purple! And yes, it's hot. And like some other parents, we didn't use it much during the winter months. So now we're done with it - I gave it only 3 stars because of the price tag, given the little use we got from it."
3,My son liked it but...,"...I felt uncomfortable with the position it forced him into, as it looked to me as though he had too much pressure being exerted onto his spine. My husband sometimes used this for long day trips, but I mostly preferred to carry the boy in my arms or use a Maya wrap."
5,Worth the cost,"I was hesitant spending so much on a carriere, but it made such a difference. I was finally able to get work done a round the house and calm my fussy baby. He seemed very well supported and comfortable and so was I."
5,A must have,I just love carrying the baby around in my Baby Bjorn. It soothes the baby when he sleeps. I can take him out in cold weather and feel his body heat against my sweater while covering him under my coat.
5,So cute,My 9 year old got into the bunnicula series last year and her 5 year old brother felt left out. I was thrilled to see an easy to read version of the books. My five year old is a beginning reader so he can identify sight words a blend sounds. He was so happy to have a bunnicula book of his own and his sister often reads it with him.
1,To paraphrase Klosterman...,"(This)writing of Chuck Klosterman is shite. It is virtually unreadable. Like an intricately designed maze that went nowhere, it epitomized pretension...."
4,Good for Overcoming Masturbation Anxiety,"I am very happy that this book exists, because masturbation should not be pushed aside in sex books as easily as it is. It did not teach me anything new, however. If you love your body, are sexually confident, and have never had any physical or emotional issues with masturbating, then this book is probably redundant. The author writes the book by describing different periods in her life, and how her own sexuality evolved. She also describes how she taught a type of ""sex therapy group"" and what she learned from her students. It is an interesting book to own, and if you are in any way uncomfortable with your sexuality it would be a good book to read. (If you are over-comfortable with your sexuality, it's always fun to have books like these on your shelf!)"
2,Didn't help......,I bought this for my wife. Hoping it would show her that it's OK to touch herself. She has always seen self satisfaction as wrong. This book really missed the mark. The section on group masterbation and homosexuality really turned her off. This book portays the writer as a sex know-it-all out of the free-love sixtys. It does not begin to help those who don't know what they are missing and need a little push. The book hit the shelf after 1 day.
4,Thanks Betty!,"Having also read Romantic Love Wars, some of the stories in both books are repeated. but I think the perspective and message of this book comes thru with a clear voice. - It's okay to know and love yourself.. Thank you Betty, I needed that.."
4,Great product for the money,"Got this for my husband for Christmas, it is a great weather station for the money, we paid $99.00, usually costs $279.00. The only thing I dont like about it is all the outdoor components are made of plastic, so Im not sure how many years they will hold up. Otherwise it tells everything you may need to know, very easy to use, relativly easy to put up. It took my hubby and I about 20 minutes."
3,John Oates Solo Dual Disc,"I picked-up this John Oates Dual Disc called ""Solo - The Album, The Concert"" from Amazon. It's a combination of his 2002 ""Phunk Shui"" album (which includes the bonus tracks ""Mona Lisa's Eyes"", ""Time Will Tell"" and a live version of ""People Get Ready"").The DVD side of the disc contains his 2004 ""Live at The Historic Wheeler Opera House"" show. I would suggest buying that separately since it includes a CD with the live show and some extra songs not on the DVD, plus the price is right. See my reviews on those also."
5,Fast & Fancy,To be a good dancer you need fast & fancy footwork. In this video you can learn a lot of different steps and variationes. The Instructors Marcus & Bärbl were thorough and easy to follow. We know Marcus & Bärbl for a long time and we promise they have a lot of experience in teaching and competing.
5,LOVE THESE,"This is the best product on the market I have ever used for cleaning up and killing germs. Better than the gel and or liquid germ killer, this product can be carried in your pocket or purse or in a handy ziplock bag in the car for any and all uses. During cold season this product has been a life saver. The size is great for large hands as well as wiping down areas when you are out in public. The Vinamines A & E and Aloe keep your skin from drying and the textured wipe is like a cloth that insures a cleaner feeling. They just don't make a better product and now..... I am informed by the manufacture GoJo Industries that they are replaceing this product with another. Shame on them!!!! I have tried their replacement and it is horrible!!!! Why in the world would you get rid of something so wonderful? Guess they are really out to make money at all cost and to the loss of their customers."
1,THESE SUCK!,"THESE WIPES SUCK! THEY ARE TOO SMALL (CAUTION: THEY ARE NOT 6""X8"") AND THEY DRY OUT WAY TOO FAST! THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT EVEN MAKE THE 6""X8"" ANY MORE. SO BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR CANNOT MAKE ANY OBCENE PROFIT, NORMAL PROFIT APPARENTLY WILL SIMPLY NOT BE ENOUGH, THEY QUIT MAKING THE 6""X8"" ONES ALL TOGETHER.SO i GUESS WE ARE STUCK WITH THESE 5""X7"" ONES THAT TRULY SUCK!"
2,Not the best ever...,"These three things struck me about this novel: 1. The character development was lacking Instead of developing the new characters, Mr. Ludlum used half the book to cover old ground (Matarese Circle) in case you forgot, or hadn't read it (I guess). 2. The suspense was generated by things that never happened It strikes me that, if the world's intelligence agencies were as deeply penetrated as the Ludlum would have us believe, then this plot should have had a substantial number of twists and turns, none of which happened! 3. Every page in the book had at least one italicized word, usually in a question or exclamation. After I finished reading the book, I felt like I'd just listened to a screaming contest! As so many others have said before me, ""If that's the best you have to offer, then, Mr. Ludlum, it's time to retire""."
3,"Typical Ludlum novel, without creativity","It was a typical Ludlum novel with the good guy after the bad guy and the badguys are trying to take over the world. The book has good pace but lack any creativity. Nothing happens that you havn't already predicted. I would say The Bourne Identity was his best, try that if you havn't already read it."
3,It was OK,"When i picked up this book i didn't know it was a sequel but it didn't even matter cause it explained it all. I'm only 16 but I gave it 3 stars because i liked the characters and the plot and the action was great. But i'll have to agree with these people about evil bankers? That part was just plain stupid. It gets really slow between the action parts. However, i think if they were ever going to make a movie on it, it would be great."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","I agree with the previous comments, Ludlum's best stuff was the Bourne Trilogy. This book just serves up more of the same stuff...bad guy wants to take over the world...one man can stop it. By the half way point of the book, I was simply skimming the pages reading the dialogue so I could finish the book as quickly as possible."
1,painfully bad attempt by the master,"I can't even begin to descibe this one. The late great Ludlum must have been drunk while writing this horrid novel. I didn't even come close to finishing this one; nothing about it was consistent while everything about it was nonsensical. I love the bulk of his pre-1990 works, and I even enjoyed The Scorpio Illusion and The Apocolypse Watch, but this one is a real stinker. Avoid."
2,Ludlum is getting old!,I found the book to be interesting at first however it became very repetitive and predictable. The same words are used over and over as filler material. He is also becoming less believable in that the characters are just not able to do as he writes.
1,"This book ""It's not so gooda""",Ludlum should be ashamed to have put his name on it. Too bad your ratings don't go much lower.
1,This book continues an apparent downward trend.,"I bought Matarese Countdown because I have read all of Mr. Ludlum's novels. Absent strong reviews for any future works, this is the last I'll bother reading. The gripping turns of the plot that made his early works page turners are more contrived than ever in this one. To say that the dialogue is wooden is a serious insult to our friends from the plant kingdom. The narrative is downright silly in places, and even contains obvious grammatical errors (which the editor should have caught).This book continues an apparent downward trend in quality; though nearly as poorly written, at least the Cry of the Halidon had an interesting plot."
1,A downer,"With apologies to the late, great Ludlum, this is a snooze-fest. Mostly dialogue and very little action. Zzzzzzzz"
2,Too negative and ideal,Not a good read. The author(s) come across as extremely feminist and claim that all women subject to these conditions are victims of globalization and capitalization. I don't buy their theories nor do I find this book very objective in the message they SHOULD be conveying.
5,Highly recommended for fans of Roy Rogers,"Cowboy Princess: Life With My Parents Roy Rogers And Dale Evans is Cheryl Rogers-Barnett's true story of growing up as the daughter of ""the King of Cowboys"" and ""the Queen of the West"", whose popular exploits on movies and TV captivated the nation. Joy, the gruelling demands of the entertainment industry, the terrible loss of three siblings, and the lively personalities of those who shared their lives with Roy Rogers, Dale Evans, and Cheryl Rogers-Barnett fill this highly readable and personal account. Highly recommended for fans of Roy Rogers and the western movies of yesteryear."
1,I did not know you could grill so many canned and processed food items,Quite a revelation to me! This is probably not the book for the health conscious or those who enjoy fresh food.
4,pretty good,"This book took it slow, it let you be there, walking in the shoes of the writer. I did enjoy this book."
5,Mysteries as they should be,"John D. MacDonald's TRAVIS McGEE series doesn't just offer good reading but great reading in the thriller/mystery genre. When modern day writers disappoint I like to return to the series to once again shake my head in amazement at how MacDonald's writing transcends time with keen insight to humanity, its virtues and, of course, its darker side.McGee is everybody's favorite friend and MacDonald made him available to all of us. While THE LONELY SILVER RAIN is good book start at the beginning of the series and work your way through the title colors. If you can't find them on-line then used bookstores usually have a few at ridiculously low prices. Enjoy!"
1,Bogus Story,"I could probably give this book another star had the authors held it out as fiction. Alas, they did not. I thoroughly enjoyed this book when I first read it in the early 1980s. Of course, I was only a teenager then. After doing a stint in the US Army, I slowly figured out that the story is complete fantasy. One of the authors claims to be a New Zealand SAS trooper who accompanied the seven man commando team sent to assasinate North Vietnamese and Chinese leaders, yet he doesnt even know the color of beret NZSAS soldiers wear! The story is replete with error after error after error. Leave this dud on the bookshelf."
5,Authenticity?,"As this is one of my favorite books, I was delighted to meet a former British SAS co-worker familiar with the authors. He attested to the accuracy of the ideas (weapons,attitudes,etc.) of the book, though confirming that it is fiction. He recommended Bravo Two Zero as an authentic story of true events. Five Fingers remains the masterpeice of it's kind."
1,"Written for Professors, NOT STUDENTS!!!! (get 1st ed. if you absolutely must)","This book is a HARD read. It is very ACADEMIC.It is not ""accessible to readers at all levels,"" as it claims to be.College professors use this book for undegraduate courses, assuming students have the same expertise/background in history as they do. That is an unfair assumption.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SECOND EDITION! GET THE 1st INSTEAD!(Chances are, unless you're the author, you won't understand the book regardless of the edition)Trust me, I got this book for a college course and got zero helpful/practical information out of it."
2,OK QUALITY,"THIS PRODUCT WAS LESS POLISHED THEN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. THE WOOD WAS VERY CORSE AND PARTS OF THE WOOD WERE CHIPPED AND MISSING. IF YOUR EXPECTING TO USE IT, IT WILL NEED WORK:(SAND AND FINISH) OR ELSE YOU WILL HAVE SNAGGED CLOTHES. HOWEVER IF ITS JUST A PROP GO FOR IT!"
2,Small,"I suppose this is fine for really small items like llingerie, however it is small with untreated would, just feels cheap...Wierd thing is i ordered this with a galvanized tub for my hubby who washes his whites by hand and both were much smaller and cheaper looking than expected. We could only laugh when we saw them.Wish I had purchased one of the true antique used ones saw online, now I'm afraid it's notbwith it to pay return shipping.after all of this, my hubby is like , thanks, but no thanks. I'll use my hands to wash my t-shirts! Lol. Oh well, I guess I'll wash a few undies by hand to make this seem worthwhile :-/"
2,Who Produced This????,"I bought this on a trip to Las Vegas a few years ago & never got around to watching it. I just returned from another trip to LV & remembered the DVD.Although the overall footage & info is good (footage looks like it was takin from a VHS), the audio production is the worst I've ever heard. What amazes me is that someone had to approve this. I tried looking for credits & found none.In some sections the music is so loud that you can't here the narrator. In others, the narration is missing, the music dips, like the narrator is going to come in & there's nothing for a few minutes. At other times the narrator's voice sounds completely different, it might have even been someone else. I accedently put on the Japanese audio track at one point & it sounded like it was recorded on a $25 home recorder with a $5 mic.It doesn't really cost much more to have some quality control. I'd love to know who produced this & what they were thinking."
3,Big Trouble - The Crew - Oscar,The Crew is forgettable. Not much there. Oscar was OK with Stallone in a comedy. But Big Trouble is just a mindless littlecomedy with a good job from everybody. Funny; holds your attention; lots of laughs and just a good way to spend an hour or so. I watch it once or twice a month and enjoy it every time.
2,La Crosse professonal weather station,"My main reason for purchasing this unit was for the rain gauge and wind speed. Everything worked fine until the first thunderstorm, then the rain gauge and wind speed quite working. After many tries got it to work again until the next thunderstorm and lost them both again. (During these storms the lightening was never very close) Contacted La Crosse support and after a week finally got a response from them and was able to get the wind speed operating again but not the rain gauge. Now after having the unit for ten months the wind speed quite working for good. Save your money and buy something else!"
1,It Sucks,"The weather station never really worked right. From the beginining it gave obviously false readings. Within a month the rain guage failed. I repeatedly tried to get the company to help. They suggested all kinds of fixes before acknowleging Uunder pressure) that the rain guage and station needed to be returned. A lot of this of this involved trips on and off the roof, several emails, and wasted time. After I received the new equipment, a whole new set of problems (along with the old ones) arose. Then the warranty expired. The device is crap and so is the company."
2,Lacrosse weather station,I am very disappointed in this weather station. The wind sensor received with the kit was faulty and had to be replaced. After setting up the system and getting it working it only took a matter of two to three weeks for the rain gauge to stop working and the wind sensor to stop recording direction. I paid the higher price and expected much more from this unit. Anybody that wants to watch the weather seriously should not consider this unit. I would consider it a toy except for the amount of time and energy it takes to set up properly is not for children. I would hope that Amazon and the weather channel both remove there support of this unit.
1,Disgrace to The Doors' legacy & insult to the buyer,"This release is a saddening disgrace to The Doors' official discography. All tracks are audience recordings, and even considering this they're mediocre ones too. The cd's are hardly listenable and only of interest to dedicated completists.To ask 81.00 dollars for this product is an outrageous insult to buyers. The only release these recordings should have is for example as free downloads on a website.Don't buy this! If you gotta have these tracks, hunt down the ""original"" bootlegs, if only to prevent the remaining doors from earning one single buck for this embarassing fraud."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!TOO!!!!,"THE GUY BEFORE ME SAYS IT ALL!!!! AND I QUOTE ""what a disappointment. After reading the material I had to buy it, only to be severly disappointed when I listen. The sound is similar to the old tin can and string communication device we fastened as kids. It does give the discalimer of being bootlegged material not the normal quality but I would no more distbute and price this offering at what they did. This should be for diehards only who have to hear these rare recordings because you will only want to play one time. If you want a real quality recording with the Doors and Jim Morrison at their best try ""The Doors, Live in Detroit"" I would happily pay $100 for material like ""Live in Detorit"" than $80 for some shoddy bootlegs."""
3,gorgeous earrings with a design problem,"These earrings are lovely, medium size and weight; they give a gentle tug to the ear, but are not so heavy as to be uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the design has two problems. First, the earwires are a very narrow gauge. One of mine broke off after a week of careful wear. I will have to visit a jewelry repair shop and pay to have them modified to accomodate heavier earwires, which will increase the price of the earrings. Second, the lotus flower dangles at the bottom tend to hang up on one another and become stuck, as a result of parts of the weave being uneven or too close together. Perhaps you will get a pair that does not hang up; I did not. In any case, the earwires are much too thin and too short to have the strength to support the earring. If you buy these, you might look into replacing the wires."
5,Perfect Starting Point,"A very helpful introduction. The text is accessible and lucid. Gonzalez does a good job framing church movements in the context of general trends of thought and covers key secular thinkers and movements where appropriate. He also does well covering the whole church and following the developments of the papacy, Catholic church, and Orthodox. However, this leads to the treatment of eras in parallel accountings rather than a linear narrative which was confusing at times. The pictures are fun, timeline could be more helpful in its presentation, and while I would have liked more maps, this text has the most helpful maps of those that I read on this era. It is also not referenced but it does have extensive recommended readings. I would highly recommend this as an introductory text on Church History as part of (or in preparation for) a class or for personal interest."
5,Christmas With Conniff,"If you are looking for a traditional sound for Christmas, my choice is Christmas with Conniff -- put up there with the sounds of Kenny G, this cd is one of the enlightening traditions of my Christmases."
5,A Complex and Satisfying Novel,"R. H. Stavis' novel, Daniel's Veil is a layered, complex story that goes a bit deeper than your standard supernatural thriller. It probes the psychological cause and effect that allows the reader to truly understand the characters. Very well done."
4,Orthodox spiritual reading meets travelogue,"Sometimes people have a hard time with spiritual reading, feeling like every Orthodox book they try to read is too removed from their life to really connect with. On that note I have a recommendation.I am just finishing ""Pilgrimage to Dzhvari"" by Valeria Alfeyeva. The author is the mother of Bp Hilarion (Alfeyev) of the Russian Orthodox Church. The book is a loosely autobiographical account of a Russian woman's coming to faith in the waning days of the Soviet Union and particularly of her pilgrimage to two Orthodox monasteries in Georgia. It contains a lot of wisdom from the Orthodox tradition but is written more like a memoir or a narrative than most books you might consider spiritual reading."
4,"Good, but a little dated...",A good book that seems a bit dated without the recognition of web-based planning tools such as googlemaps and google earth.
1,AVOID THIS COMPANY!,"I ordered this advertised burgundy blanket to match my sheets and curtain panels. What i got instead was a vivid, 'looks like a santa clause suit' RED colored blanket. The reverse side is a somewhat lighter shade of red and kind of spottylike, almost a red and white mix. So i called the company thinking maybe they sent the wrong color. Nope, they said they only have this color. I was asked to send pictures to show the blanket i received was not what was advertised. so i did (see customer photos). They emailed me saying that it is the same blanket - what?!?! Anyone can see there is a DRASTIC difference in color from what they advertised! So they say they will refund the cost of the blanket, but im out ALL the S&H. Which is WRONG considering this is false advertisement. So buyers BEWARE of this company!!!"
1,Not terribly interesting. It made me fall asleep...,"... although I was watching it REALLY late at the time. Really, this movie is kind of long and it takes a while for the title creature to get involved.It doesn't help that the leads' characters are not very likable."
3,"It works, but isn't exactly all purpose.","This product does great for the smaller wine bottles. However the larger ones (1.5 L), with only a slightly bigger opening they do not work for. It would work, if you could get the Rubber sealing porting to stay on when pulling up the lever, however it seems all 6 of mine, are slit in the middle, and the rubber piece comes off. This isn't a problem like I said in the smaller or (table wine) sized wine bottles. So only fitting a specific size wine bottle doesn't seem all purpose to me. I'm not sure if the rubber piece comes off for cleaning or if there even supposed to be that way. I have seen some (owned some) that are not separate pieces, and do not separate in anyway; after four years the lever broke, so these were their replacement....This is just a comment. However for value, and effectiveness-of the size they do fit, seems just fine."
4,Nice,Nice and sturdy. Clean up nice with SOS or steel wool. Would like to see it come with some type of storage bag or case.
5,Great Products,"Was so glad to find these at Amazon when looking for something a little nicer than a coat hanger for a church cookout. We love the products also to cook in our fireplace. The only complaint I have is that the hinged 4-up Safe'T'Roaster is not tight enough and the wieners slip out easily. It works better with a thicker bratwurst type. Fortunately, with the other products offered in this set, we don't really need the hinged one."
2,Politically correct wins in the end or get struck by lighting,"First episode ruined with the political, correct, impossible event of some very hetersexual woman who is also very repulsed by lesbians who accidentally falls in love with and kisses a lesbian because the lesbian had disquised herself as man. The straight woman was so repulsed that she killed the guy/woman and then mulitilated the body and this jerked around hetero woman confesses all to the star of the show without a lawyer. This episode is so unlikely and wierd your more likely to be struck by lighting. Therefore the end ruined the whole episode and the series with the lead role of a talented, difficult woman who is calle the B word in this episode that could have been good, a female sherlock holmes of the old variety. Can we not see some entertainment like this without the politically correct thing being shoved down our throuts?"
5,Closer Season 1,"With the purchase of Amazon Prime, able to watch the past seasons of Closer on my Kindle. Enjoy the show and great to see the background of relationships."
2,Yawn,"They could have made a 2 hour movie out of this and been done with it. It just seems to be pretty much the same thing over and over. Maybe if they had spent more time on character development, it would have been better."
5,The Closer Season 1,"I happened to catch this series a few weeks ago during a ""marathon"" of Season 1 playing a day or so prior to the new season preview, and was stunned at how great it is. ""Brenda's"" accent bugged me a bit at first, and I'm a Texan so that's saying something (grin). But Sedgwick maintains it, true to itself, throughout each episode, and in essence, it characterizes Brenda as a definitively ""different"" personality from her LA counterparts. Her use of a less than ""glorious"" southern accent makes the character more vivid and adds to the cognitive dissonance generated between Brenda and her coworkers.Brilliantly written and acted - FINALLY, intelligent t.v."
4,Fun Character,"Brenda Lee is so seriously flawed and dysfunctional, while being a strong force of a woman - it is a fun character to watch develop through the series."
5,King of the blues,"This is a wonderful DVD. I'm just getting started, and I found it an absolute joy. A bargain at twice the price."
4,Albert King,Good approach to Albert Kings style and such. This breakdown will help you tap into Kings playing a little bit and catch some of his best licks.
3,Too small for older babies,"I got these because they seemed larger than the Gerber bowls. Even the largest one is no bigger and the other two are actually smaller!! They are very cute, but I would not waste money on something that your baby will grow out of quick."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We have had this crappy phone for one year. and its like we had it for 6 years. it won't dial the correct number, it makes loud funny noises, you have to press the key pad very hard to dial, and it doesn't last as long off charge like they say..."
5,Yard beer bucket,"I cannot wait for my buckets to arrive so that I can fill them with ice and a few beers ,go sit in the yard under the big oak tree and enjoy the yard with a nice cold one. Much nicer eye appeal than your standard cooler. I love nostalgic garden accessories. They make me smile. : )"
1,CONTAINS MILK,"I purchased this item for my three month old who is on soy formula which doesn't have probiotics or prebiotics added to it like the cow's milk formula does. She's on soy formula because she's allergic to cow's milk. When I received the bottle and happened to look at the label, it contains milk. That's definitely something that should be included in the description!"
2,On a par with 30 and 31...,"What can I say? This book should never really have been written. All it does is rehash the events of #33, keeping the uncharacteristic elements of Tobias and leaving out any originality or furthering of either plot or character. This is a 'filler' book, just like the aforesaid #30 and #31: nothing has changed by the end. The two stars, by the way, are for Tobias who remains my favourite character...but for how long, if his books end up like this?"
5,great!!!!,"I got this doll for Christmas. I left her in the package, but she looks very beautiful! I like to buy collector barbies and leave them in the box, and sell them when I'm older. It's fun to collect them though. Over all, I give this doll five stars. I would reccommened her to any barbie lover. :)"
3,"Could've Been Better, I Thought.","Some of it was good. It got a little monotonous sometimes. Some of it was just kind of...hm...goofy. No, maybe that's not quite the right word. It wasn't really very ""pumping"" or ""HOOYAH!"" sort feeling. It just kind of lazily grooves along. Which isn't bad. Some people really like it, and that's fine.I was kind of dissapointed in it."
1,do not buy,just bought a kenwood single din radio and tried to install this dash kit in my 03 nissan altima se and it is not wide enough there is nothing anyone can do with this kit...now im waiting on the new kit to come in Metra 99-7418 looks different wider and has mounting brackets attached
1,Doesn't fit DIN stereos. Too narrow.,"Simply put, the rectangular cutout isn't wide enough. It's about 4mm too narrow for any DIN stereo module. Returning. It is literally of absolutely no use."
1,cable does not last...,have had this cable for almost 2 years. used it probably no more than 10 times. now the cable is not working and have to move it a lot just to get sound. disappointed with the quality for sure.
4,Great Value Caliper,"Good product, good service. This caliper is sturdy and inspires confidence. I have not checked the accuracy against another instrument but I imagine it does the job well enough. Measurements seem repeatable. The dual inch/mm scale is totally worth the extra $10 for this model. Country of manufacture is not listed anywhere - you can guess where it's made for this price, but unless you're a machinist, this dial caliper is a great value."
5,I Couldn't put it down!!,"I have begun to get interested in the afterlife, after reading some of Sylvia Brown's books. Since I was Jewish, I wanted to really know if the soul survives death. This book is a must-read for any person who is intrigued by the possiblity of life after death. I found many of the things said in the book correlated with the ideas of Sylvia Brown and Gary Zukov. The author delved deeply into the many facets of afterlife, and includes his own personal experiences, which are really interesting."
4,"Important Book, but Missed Opportunity","Rabbi Spitz has given us a sincere, openminded account of his exploration into the immortality of the soul. It brings together the Jewish point of view on soul experiences in a very personal, thoughtful way. I hope that it introduces Jewish people to the subjects of reincarnation and the afterlife in a rational and convincing manner. However, it fails to explore the experiences and the findings of the Jewish-Christians of the beginnings of Common Era (A.D.) and thereafter. There are many books written that introduce Christians to the concepts of reincarnation that would have been helpful to Spitz's study. For any who would read further in the exploration of these matters, the most profound study of reincarnation is the Karmic Relations lectures of Rudolf Steiner, available through the Anthroposohic Press. Steiner is compatible with Kabbalahistic practioners. Among the most prominent followers of Steiner were Orthodox Jews."
4,If you like Troma movies you'll like this.,"Die You Zombie Bastards is a really dumb movie. I am a member of that group of people who truly enjoy dumb humor. There are some laugh aloud parts that I can't mention here because they would ruin the movie but trust me, they are hilarious. Don't watch this movie thinking it is a horor movie, because it's not. There is only one scene that is sort of stomach turning, the rest is pure camp. The only one that can act their way out of a paper bag is the female lead. The rest of the actors ham it up like they were sniffing helium. If you enjoyed such Troma movies as Class of Nuke 'Em High or The Killer Condom, this movie is for you. If you think those kind of movies are dumb, run, don't walk away from this one."
5,wonderful,"DIE YOU ZOMBIE BASTARDS! is all about yelling, violence, and nudity, right in line with all those troma movies(Lloyd Kaufman even manages a voice cameo). We've got a crazy serial killer couple split up by a South Park-esque super villain who plans to turn everybody into zombies. This sends our man Red on a trek all across the world(on a geographically bizarre map) to fight zombies and hear about stories of weird Bahamaian hunters and Swedish cheese demons and all sorts of great things like that.And there's dogmen. If you love dogmen, just get this already. You can't go wrong with dogmen. Not werewolves. Dogmen. If you think the idea of dogmen isn't so great, then definitely don't buy this film.The humor's great and never lets up, it's constantly bizarre, and there's plenty of messiness and nudity to satisfy you if that's the sort of thing you demand of your ridiculous movies."
1,One star is one too many for this excuse for a movie,"Save your money and time.The positive reviews must have been written by people who are making money off the sale of it. There's no way anyone found humor or sense in this. It's awful.If you want a really worthy low-budget bizarre zombie flick, try ""Shatter Dead,"" ""Feeding the Masses,"" or ""Revolting Zombies."" All three deliver what this title promises."
4,Good Ghost Story,"The restoration of this movie was fantastic, vivid colors and a crisp picture. Although somewhat horrific, I think i would call this more of a mystery than a horror picture. Im reminded of the Hammer films, but the subdued colors and use of shadows are one hundred percent Bava. Not as scary as Black Sunday (what movie is?) but in its own way a pretty good movie, worth a look."
3,It's preverse,"I have read a lot about this film, mostly that it was impossible to see a version that was the original director's vision. Now you can. It's a ghost story with a lot of whipping. Dalia Lavi is engagned to one guy but has a thing for Christopher Lee. His sadistic treatment of her is sexually exciting and you can tell in the film. The movie is interesting and is more of a ghost story than a horror film. The sado-masochistic stuff isn't for me, but it doesn't overpower the film."
2,Not Stephen King!,"The reviewers on the back of Moore's first book in this series talk about him being the next Stephen King. Not even close. His idea is a bit 'done before', but that's not really the main problem. Where King creates well-rounded characters, Moore simply gives you a cardboard cutout of the person and then kills them off two chapters later. There's so many characters, it's hard to figure out who is who BECAUSE they aren't well-developed. And because the story is all for shock value ie: many people killed, but we're not really quite sure why (except for the husband of the woman killed as a witch), you quickly lose interest.I bought the first and the second ones in the series together, but wouldn't buy any further books. Stephen King makes people think that writing these kind of books easy. Stephen King, however, is a master storyteller, which definitely shows up when you see the difference between any of his books and something like this."
3,unfortunate,"After long period of waiting sell announced that they did not , and could not get book. My answer, don't list it for sale then till you have it physically."
3,"Before you buy a pet, read this","The best place to get a pet is from a shelter, and if you read this book, you will learn why. I have always gotten my pets from shelters, but did not know the behind-the-scenes story until I read this (and a few others). Ms. Hess writes for the general reader, and is a bit less introspective than I would have liked, but her information is sound. In fact, I would recommend this book to teenagers, precisely because it is not too high-brow. Today's kids are tomorrow's pet owners, and it is important to educate them in the realities of pet overpopulation, puppy mills, and the fact that pets are not designer accessories, but living beings who require more than some kibble and water."
3,...what happened?,"After seeing the first El Hazard series, I found myself feeling utterly lost and confused after I started watching this one. Those of you who've seen the first series may remember that it ended with the four visitors from our world returning to Earth. However, at the beginning of this show, they're suddenly back in El Hazard without any explanation. There's some definete story that got left out here. Anyway, it begins with our hero's anxiously awaiting the arrival of a new prestess, who has the power over water. But she's late in arriving, and Makoto must go out and find her...In the second episode, we meet Elliel's twin brother, and in episode three, the main characters (and one Bugrum,) get transported to yet another world. Anyway, if you can get over not being told how the four travelers from Earth returned to El Hazard, this is a lot of fun."
2,"Pretty, yes Worth the money? no","I am underwhelmed with this flexi leash. The tape seems narrow and kind of, well, cheap. I just purchased the flexi Expressions for my other dog, same animal weight/size and it is a much better leash. My elegance tape is starting to fray already and twists as the dog moves around. The handle is very lightweight and not as sturdy or comfortable in my hand as the Expressions. I am planning to order another Expressions leash so I'll have it when this one breaks."
4,Seems like good quality. Very smooth expand/retract feature.,"I love retractable leashes and this seems like a nice one so far (only had it a few days). I like that the leash is tape instead of rope style, though imo it could stand to be a bit thicker. It does say that this leash is not for ""uncontrollable/disobedient dogs"", so that's probably why. I definitely would follow the 55 lb weight limit. The color goes great with my 'give a dog a bone' tan collar (also from Amazon)."
3,Benefit for the Friesian Buyer,I could not believe there are so few books written about this magnificient breed of horse. Thanks to Laura's book I was able to get a better understanding on what this breed is about and how to go about finding a Friesian to buy. Trying to understand the pedigree line and the registration papers and so on can be a real challenge until I read this book. She does a wonderful job of breaking it down and making it all very user friendly.:)
4,Friesian Buyers Guide,"This book covers everything you need to know if you want to buy a Friesian Horse.Although it has some pictures they are all in black and white. Only the cover is in color so if you love these horses but you have no interest in buying one right away, choose other books instead. Search for the author's name, and you might find another work she is doing with lots of pictures of Friesian horses.For the horse buyers this book is of imperative reading. Mrs.Laura describes everything from the Friesian lineage to how these horses are awarded and thus giving an idea on what to expect both in the animal you are looking for and the deep pocket you need to have."
1,Be Aware of What You're Buying!,Betty Burnett's book is nothing more than a compilation of weekly news magazine articles available after the bombing. This is a book that belongs on a middle school shelf. I realize now that Rosen publishing does scholastic books. There are only 65 pages in the book from forward to appendix. There is only one first person account of the bombing. The heroic work of the crew is not discussed in any detail. There was a fantastic opportunity to discuss the challenge faced by the female chief engineer Deborah Courtney to save the ship; a first I believe in the anals of naval lore.Many of the pictures do not belong in the book as they are not of the Cole.I will donate the book I bought to my local middle school library.
5,Compelling and Timely,Dr. Beatty makes a timely contribution to Asian political studies with this book. The region's unique state of flux is captured through Beatty's incisive commentary and interview technique. Highly recommended.
5,My New Best Friend!,"Dear Consumers,I have to say, this is one of the best espresso machines I have ever owned! The machines two thermostats regulate the coffe cycle and steaming process, with a third thermostat located on the pump so the machine can operate safely under continuous use. The steam supply of the machine is excellent as well, it provides enough steam for 6 cappuccinos. The steam supply is ready in a matter of minutes, after the machine is turned on. This machines produces a perfect espresso every time, getting my day off to a wonderful start. For these reasons I can truely call this machine my new best friend!Consumer"
2,Problems,"I bought one two months ago. The price was right for a first time buyer. The pod feature is very convenient when you are only making one cup.The quality was not good. It came with a cracked plastic in the coffee filter holder that made it leak. I called Briel customer service, and they referred me to the sales office to get a new one. The sales office never returned my call. When I called customer service again, they said fax them the receipt and they would send me a new filter holder. Again, nothing. This filter holder was for the ground coffee (not pods) so I figured because I didn't use feature very often I would live with it. However, yesterday the heating element apparently burnt out and nothing heats. I dread dealing with customer service again; the aggravation may not be worth it... You get what you pay for."
2,Adequate,"This machine works if you're just making cappuccinos, lattes, etc., drinks that don't require anything more than steam and a strong coffee substance poured into them. If you drink espresso straight, and actually like it as a beverage on it's own, don't get with-in a hundred feet of this machine. The espresso it produces is only god-awful luke warm brown caffinated water.I do want to respond to other reviews and point out that the steam arm does turn off after thirty seconds unless you crank the nob as far as it will go. If the green ""brew"" light is still on while you're trying to steam, then you haven't turned the steam nob far enough.That's all the defence the machine will get, the espressos's passable if you're going to drown it in milk, and the steam arm works (though is set way too low on the machine, I had to put the machine up on an old dictionary to get it high enough off the counter to put a mug under). Get another machine. This one's just not worth it."
2,Cheap metal,"When I first got the juicer, I absolutely loved it! Finally, fresh O.J.! Worked well, was able to juices 10-20 lbs. of oranges in minutes. However, I did get the feeling there was still plenty more left in the halves. Then one day the gears felt ""sticky"", and then on one more pull of the arm the metal body just cracked and broke! Right where the arm attaches to the body it just cracked apart. This was not mechanical. it was just poor quality."
1,"Far from being ""professional""","Nice looking chrome gadget but we found it to perform poorly. The holding glass is small and tilted very easily. The halves stucked to the cup on the lever. You have to remove the fruit halves with your fingers (very impractical and messy). The cranker does not produce enough leveler pressure often leaving plenty of juice in the halves, no matter how hard you push. If you push to hard the stability of the juicer is not good. There are no suction feet to hold the machine in place. Can't recommend it. Far from being a so call ""professional"" equipment."
4,Good work out!,If you don't want to work for your fresh juice this isn't the juicer for you.Some have mentioned problems with the gears but a quick spritz of WD 40 on mine and it's worked fine since I've had it.It'll squeeze small grapefruits to small limes and everything in between.
2,Pilot Point Tip a Big Plus and a Bigger Minus,"I used these bits for a heavy duty job drilling both wood and aluminum. They worked great for a while, however, the Pilot Point Tip eventually lots its bite. With a dull Pilot Point Tip the drill bit will simply spin on top of the surface you're drilling. So once the Tip is dull you'll either need to sharpen it, which is difficult because its so small, or throw away the bit.Its a real shame because until the tip dulled the bits did a fantastic job. However, I'm switching back to a standard tip drill bit."
3,Not what you think....,"I like this CD a lot, but it's French pop, not the musette I was expecting. The styles run from disco to blues."
2,"its...................................WIERD,BUT.....OK",THIS IS A POKEMON MOVIE.SO FAR THIS IS THE SECOND BORINGEST POKEMON MOVIE I EVER WATCHED.I LIKED THE 1 2 3 4 7TH POKEMON MOVIE BETTER. I THINK THE STORY IS BORING TOO. THE MINI MOVIE IS THE BORINGEST POKEMON MINI MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!
2,too bad,"This movie is Extremely bad. No one knows how the next movie will be. The 1,2 and mewtwo Returns is good but the 3rd,4th,5th in my Opinion is really bad. even in the dvd their is no Preview on the next movie the camp pikachu. I hope the next movie will be good as the first movie i mean a legendary pokemon must be rare and strong no one can see it you know like these stuff."
5,A good movie a must have.,I love this movie. It even has a little short in the begining to tell adults what pokemon is about. So adults don't get counfused when they are stuck watching it with their kids. And the relationship between Latios and Latias is so cute. It had a couple of parts that made me laugh. But in the end Latios dies and I cried. Latias holds her big brother's hand. And has to let go. And Latias watches as her big brother dissaper before her eyes. But it has a happy ending. You can see Latios and Latias flying across the city with their farther.
5,Wonderful lead character makes this book a winner!,"This is a coming-of-age book. Which puts it in a category with thousands of others. However, the lead character is so fleshed out and so interesting that I never wanted to end this book. I could spend much more time with this character. I was sad that the last chapter gave a quick summary of how the next decade worked out for Taylor, because I would have enjoyed an entire sequel to read the details!"
2,Experiment in Torture 2007,"A wealthy artist with a taste for torture pays a group of unsuspecting exotic dancers to join him for a weekend at his secluded mountain retreat in this blood-soaked tale of defiled flesh and brutal suffering.It sounded like an offer that was too good to be true - and it was. Lured to a secluded house in the hills by a man who seemed like nothing more than a wealthy eccentric, a group of sultry strippers quickly discover that they have just made a fatal misjudgment of character.Methodically drugged, bound and tortured with everything from a blowtorch to a power drill, these unfortunate souls are subsequently transformed into a depraved work of art designed to transcend the concepts of good and evil."
3,What's in it?,"What's amazon doing here?There is no product description, what films are they putting on this compilation?I had to zoom in on the cover to find out.Come on Amazon, get it together!"
1,wrong cd,I want to find eddie raven cd that has the song island on it Liberty does not have the song on the ablbum.
5,Class Project Review,"Okay, my name is Nareg Minaskian. I am doing this review because the book was exellent. The book is really good for begining pilots that have trouble communicating with the ATC (air traffic control). It teaches you the principals of communication, what to say, what the ATC wants to know from you and many more. It even reviews what kind of traffic patterns there are, what are the sides of the patterns called and much more. This book I rate it a 5 out of 5 because it tells you everything that you need to know about communications between you and the ATC. The ATC is the most important thing in your whole flying career. They are the people that give you the clearences that you need and they tell you how to get wherever you want to go and even tell you what to do to get there. They basically baby-sit you and all you have to do is follow their directions. Once again, I recommend this book to any student pilots or even people that want to learn how to fly."
1,A NOT FUNNY HOMOPHOBIC BUMPER STICKER...,"This bumper sticker makes little sense and is not funny. It is simply homophobic. Substitute the word ""heterosexual"" for the word ""lesbian"". It makes just as much sense. No one becomes a lesbian, any more than one becomes a heterosexual. This bumper sticker merely advertises the ignorance of the bearer. Moreover, not going to church or practicing witchcraft is not synonymous with being a lesbian. If, however, you think that it is, then by all means, this is the bumper sticker for you."
5,AMAZING!,This is some of the most amazing set of materials I have ever purchased. There is the right amount of scientific theory paird with spirituality! The Dr.'s represented in this series are brilliant cutting edge NeuroCognitive Scientists. I could not peel myself away from this series!
4,great doghouse,"Only thing I would change is make the top of the entrance longer than the bottom so rain would not be able to blow in; otherwise I love this doghouse. If you buy it for outside use, put it under a covered patio or something."
3,Dimension on this page is incorrect,"The correct dimension for this particular item is as follows when it was shipped:1 Indigo Dog House Medium, 37.5"" x 30.5"" x 22.8""This link will give you an idea what is correct for your doghttp://www.petmate.com/Catalog.plx?CID=4"
3,goat,"This was a lot smaller than I anticipated for a large, a large dog would not fit comfortably. It is well built but I cannot use it for what I purchased it for which was to help a goat get out of the weather. A normal sized large igloo would have worked"
3,Joan Johnston has never written a book this good.,"I felt that this book was very good . Except I didn't really see the book to be as good as I thought it could have been. However, in the end the book was overall excellent."
4,Good read for a Victomology class,"I had to read this book for a Victomology class that I was taking to supplement my Criminal Justice major. I was pleasantly surprised by the readability of this book seeing as that most of my fun-reads are in the apocalyptic/ zombie fiction genre. Meili was concise and very descriptive with her experiences as a rape victim, but more importantly, a brain trauma survivor.This book is inspiring and easy to relate to regarding overcoming adversity. A quick read leaving you with a positive feeling."
5,Beautiful,These earings are just as beautiful in person as they are in the picture. I bought them for my wife and she absolutely loved them.
4,"It is fun, even without the fan","I bought the model 131 becaused the model 130 was only $10 cheaper and the 131 included the fan and more programs. I don't use the fan and would rather not have it (warning, you CAN'T remove it). My laptop fits perfectly in the magazine holder but the fan makes a little lump against the screen. Anyhow, I am VERY HAPPY with this model. Used to have an eliptical machine before and this is a lot more fun and also smaller. Trully recomend. I don't give five stars because the product can ALWAYS be better."
3,Comparing Schwinn 130 with 131,"Is the difference between the Schwinn 130 & 131 worth the price difference? Does anyone know if there is any qualitative difference, other than the greater amount of computer programs on the 131?Thanks so much!"
3,"In Hebrew, it's ""The New Zionists"", which is closer ...","""Elvis in Jerusalem"" is not a good title for this collection of reflections on present-day Israeli society. It is, in my opinion, a direction-less appendix to his more substantial (and more laudable) works: ""One Palestine Complete"", ""The Seventh Million"", and ""The First Israelis."" (I would love Segev to tackle the settler movement next, or perhaps secret relations between Israeli and Arab governments over the years, or maybe the complex and evolving identity of Palestinian citizens of Israel.)As for this piece, it is enjoyable but has a ""snack food"" quality to it. Anything Segev is better than your run-of-the-mill work by a journalist-cum-sociologist; nonetheless, I would have preferred this to be an outline for a meatier book on conflicts between Zionism, Modernism, Judaism and Americanization.Fascinating, and he's among the best, but this was an afterthought at best and a retread of covered ground otherwise."
5,An Israeli's reshuffeling of Israeli history,"Historian and columnist Tom Segev contributes to the long series of books on the Middle-East with a book that fascinates and thrills. It made me look at Israel and the country's near history with new eyes. This small book makes you reflect on accepted truths and myths about the country and it's inhabiltants. Segev's book represents someting new and different, and inspired me to buy a couple of other of his books on the subject. Consider ""Elvis in Jerusalem: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel"" an appetizer for further reading of this ""new historian's"" books."
5,great,"i love them they r perfect and have great protection! i am only 12 but the large fit me so i suggest unless u r extremely small, only kids 10 or 11 and under should get the small"
1,These pads do not protect you well for skateboarding,"When I received these pads I found their quality to be okay and the fit was pretty good. I use the elastic sleeve instead of just putting the Velcro straps on. That keeps them in place much better if you fall.The problem with these pads is that if you fall while moving, the edge of the pad will catch the pavement and slide the pad up your knee/arm so that you have no protection just when you need it most.The first time I though I just didn't have them on tight enough. The second time I realized what happened and looking closer at the pad I could see how the pavement ground the edge of the pad down, pulled it off my arm and now I'm nursing two huge raspberries on my elbows.They might protect you from falling straight down, but if you slide on the pavement these pads are not going to work for you."
2,Junior size is very small,"We got the Junior size based on what we read. My boy just turned 10, and he's average height, but very thin. The pads could barely get pulled on, and are so uncomfortable that he won't wear them."
2,Tiny earrings,"While these earrings are beautiful, they are way too small for human ears...maybe im exaggerating.., they would fit a baby. The detail is hard to see because of the size, and like another reviewer, mine were also bent. I gave two stars because they are nice, so if you want really small studs, then they might be right for you."
4,Chicago Blues Great Captured Live,"Otis Rush is captured live on this 1988 release to marvelous effect. Recorded at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1985, this album presents virtually his entire set. [Note: The album is a bit short at 39:16.] Rush's soulful vocals and stinging guitar leads are featured throughout, especially on the instrumental ""Tops,"" one of three originals (""Right Place, Wrong Time"" and ""Keep On Lovin' Me Baby"" are the other two). Rush also does some extended soloing on the nearly 9-minute cover of B.B. King's ""Gambler's Blues."" The nearly 8-minute instrumental ""I Wonder Why"" is a highlight. Rush is ably backed by a six-piece band, including a horn section. RECOMMENDED"
5,Completely absorbing story which echos today,"This an absolutely absorbing story of the Battle fo the Crater near the end of the civil war. But this book is more than just a civil war novel. It is a study of how people with different agendas and motives affected the war, and ultimately the lives of many people. If you work in corporate America, you will see modern simliarities which will makeyou simulatneously laugh and cry: The general from West Point who wrote the book on military mining but never stepped foot in a mine; the poor decisions made because the motive was to personally win, at the expense of winning the war; the yankee ingenuity of the 'workers' to solve problems in spite of no support -- even intereference -- from above. It is a wonderful story that is easy to tell as a teaching aid later. Great book!"
4,one of the best duos in hip hop,their debut. they sure came out with a bang. they maintained their career too. their longevity was long and strong!
1,Inconsistent consistency,"One tablet taste fine and is 'blended' well. The next one has chunks of the various ingredients in it and tastes awful. I usually have good luck with Solaray quality, but not this time. I took about 4-5 of them and threw the rest away."
2,Cannot recommend this tape!,"The tapes had the potential to be excellent. The descriptions, sites photographed and the music were excellent. Unfortunately, the immages were not sharp. They weren't blurry but rather were like little blocks. Very unpleasant to watch."
5,must have for safety,This product is a must have with its digital display that detects even low-level carbon monoxide levels that over time can cause severe long-term health problems. Don't scrimp on any model that doesn't have a digital display and that doesn't advertise as detecting the lowest levels.
4,Convenient Installation,Easy to install. Good installation instructions. It's sitting on a bedrooms night table casting a reassuring glow. Too bad it had to be made in China.
1,"Horrible - but yes, you need SOMETHING... no peace of mind here.","We have had our Kidde monitor for 6 months or so. My husband is gone and this thing just went crazy - I have no idea where the manual is, and the short descriptions on the back of the unit do not describe the constant, rapid, fire-alarm type beeps coming out of thing. Took me 15 minutes of holding my finger on the disable button while trying to get the battery out - but that is not the issue, I guess (you should have seen me, though - I was hitting it at one point - alarms that loud and are horrifying when you have already gotten the message and CANNOT disable it without tools). Like another tester, this alarm still went off when I took it outside - ambient air made no difference. It was a malfunction and it was not the 'malfunction beep' pattern. I was too freaked out to notice any error message being displayed before I yanked the thing out of the wall. Find something else. From the reviews, the malfunction rate is too high."
5,CO detector is good insurance,"I originally bought this product at Home Depot, but returned it when I saw I could get two of them from Amazon for less than what I'd paid for one. Nice digital display, battery backup, versatile plug-in options (vertical or horizontal, high or low). Sleek design doesn't stick out from the wall too much, which makes it less tempting for young children to pull out of the wall, and easier to vacuum around."
3,Older stock,This is a life limited item. I would have preferred a unit that was not a year old already. I have used this product for years without an issue.
4,Nighthawk Detector,The product was delivered as promised with no issues of any kind. The item is a plug n play unit with battery backup an provides the security that is needed when using gas heat. Great product coming from a great company
1,very short life,"""This is the third Kidde Nighthawk that we've owned and all have exhibited the same behavior - after a little more than a year they produce a false alarm in the dead of night.""I completely agree with the above reviewer. It works fine initially. But it only lasts about a year. After that, it starts to produce a false alarm. I have purchased two of them back-to-back, thinking that the first one was a fluke, but the second one also only worked for a year."
5,Wonderful and charming!,"A must-have for anyone who sneaks a peek at ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" or ""Jeopardy"". This book shows what quiz questions should be like - ones that have answers that simply amaze you."
5,Loyal user for years!,"I have been using this lotion since the 70's. Always am asked what am I wearing, the fragrance is amazing! Very light, not greazy."
5,Great Moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer, and it has been around for a long time. I first used it when I lived in Hawaii 40 years ago...Now I spend lots of time in the mountains in high altitude, which is very dry.Mountain Ocean absorbs quickly and really helps!!"
5,Finally found one that works!,"I have searched high and low for a cocktail shaker that was large enough to make a ""batch"" of drinks and that didn't leak. Finally, I found one. This shaker doesn't leak like so many others and is a good size. I'm looking forward to using it for many years to come."
2,not whats pictured,the pack that is shown in the picture is not what you will recieve there are no quick releases on the pack this was the whole reason I ordered this backpack
4,It sure was Unexpected.,This book was very exciting to start with but it was a weird way of how cassie got down to austrilia plus she had visser 3 following her and that was interesting for a while but then it started to get boring. But it came back with cassie get home to her friends and family so it was a good book. The big thing for the book was the whole cassie running from the visser it was cool.
4,"""1999"" could be one of 2000's first hits","Rarely do I hear a song by a virtually unknown artist and immediately become excited about it. But that is exactly what has happened with John Oszajca's new single. ""Back in 1999"" is so clever and catchy that, with its bouncy sing-ability, it could easily be the next ""Steal My Sunshine.&quot."
3,"""Little House"" UK style.","Some heavy weight British talent on this series I had hoped for a bit more depth. Too much of a ""Feel Good"" series. Not a bad show but a combination of Jane Austen meets Laura Ingalls Wilder witha touch of Father Murphy and Doctor Quinn added.Actress Claudie Blakley, daughter of musician Alan Blakley, has one of the lead roles and she's wasting her talent on what is not much more than a ""soap"" in period costume.Season One was just too predictable and the best episode was one in which the fine British actor, Phil Davis guested.Not bad for light weight entertainment just don't expect shades of Dickens or Austen."
3,multi cable,Dissapointed that the description wasn't clear as to how it works. The package says that you cannot transfer fire wire to usb...the description says that you can.Not clear.
3,Okay,"Not at all what I expected. I was hoping for more things that we could use at home, rather than having to go to a gymn to use equipment there."
4,Strength Training,"This book meets the needs of individuals of a certain age. The authors give instructions on how to do the exercises and provide information on the benefits. Both gym equipment and free weight exercises are described. Moreover, the authors provide suggested programs including training for individual body parts such as chest, legs and arms but also programs for all around muscle toning. This is a useful and helpful manual for individuals interested in weight trainig. Moreover, it has the added benefit of motivating the user to find an appropriate program and stick with it."
2,George popped up this bunt into a double play!,I cherished Men At Work. I further fostered my love of the game with his classic tale. Bunts has a few interesting tales and tidbits but overall fails to live up to the predecessor. Did he write this one weekend while on vacation? Or are these his scraps left over from Men At Work?
1,This movie sets a poor example.,"I don't mind too much if a movie is poorly-written, because writing requires talent, not just education. But this movie sets a bad and unsafe example for everyone who watches it, and especially the kids who are its target audience. No open vehicle is safe to operate without a helmet, and the archaic and ineffective lap belts in this movie only add to the incompetent image of whomever owns the go-cart track. Lack of knowledge about your subject guarantees that a script will be bad.Practical Outdoor Survival: A Modern Approach"
3,Nothing extraordinary about it,"I bought this bag last december when I purchased my HP Livestrong Laptop. The bag is not one of the best out there. You can get much better bags from competitors (Targus etc) with better feature sets. As I am a student, the bag has not withstood the rigours of my student life and already the seems are bursting on the side exposing the low quality workmanship.The padding at the back is nice though especially when I am biking around. The side pockets on the outside are nice as you can store the power supply, PDAs etc in them so that they do not scratch the laptop or books inside.Overall, it is not worth the price you pay for it. I would rather buy something better next time around for the same price."
5,A must read for both parents and the childfree!,"Elinor's book is a real eye-opener, pointing out the inequalities which exist in our child worshipping society today that affect not only the childfree, but the lower income families as well. Her facts and figures point to a trend in America which has been in the making for nearly 30 years. A trend which shows the changes in parental values from children once being considered a privilege and a responsibility to being viewed by wealthy ""gotta have it all"" parents as a loss in careers, time and money. Losses which the middle and upper income parents expect to be compensated for at the expense of the lower-income families and the childfree. The Baby Boon explains how the poor families and their children gain nothing from all the sugar-coated ""family-friendly"" policies being offered by the politicians and how the childfree have been reduced to second-class citizens."
5,Cool!!!!,"The book Nicholas Mickelby is very interesting to me. I loved the suspence in the book so much I just couldn't put it down.Natasha Lamb, Age 11."
3,Not really gold tone,"The actual color is VERY brassy. It's not anywhere near as muted as the tone in the picture. I kept it because I like the keyring closure and it seems solid and well made. However, I would never have purchased it had I known the real color was so far from the one pictured."
4,GREAT BOOK,I enjoyed reading this book and could not put it down. Leila is an exceptional writer the way she keeps you wanting to know if the friendship is going to get better or worse and if any of them change for the better. It was real she presented real characters that we see in everyday life so I know many young women can relate and learn hopefully that you can come out of a life of madness if you have faith. This book also shows the power of friendship and how it can override everything. I like how all of them were down to do whatever for the other when it came to beating someone down thats real.
1,don't bother,"This book felt forced and pointless. I got the sense he'd said he was going to do a novel and had gotten an advance, and then he just felt obligated to turn in just anything. Because that's what this is: just anything. It's a numbing list of glitzy people and parties interlarded with whispered nuggets of OJ-iana. There's no plot, few fresh observations, and little insight into what happened. The character, Gus, if truly based on Dominick Dunne, reveals a sad and wearying self-disgust."
2,Can't Be Dominick Dunne,"Dominick Dunne is a fabulous author -- witty and so insightful. This book was terrible. Did he really write it? Seems like he is trying to convince us what a popular guy he is by dropping every name he can think of. As if we care?! Plus, it's so passe. Big big disappointment."
3,Found pseudo-memoir format frustrating,"I enjoyed other Dominick Dunne novels, but I found this one stupid. The memoir/novel format was just his Dunne's personal thoughts thinly disguised as fiction. I kept waiting for the real novel to start and it never did."
2,Nothing But Name-Dropping,"At first I was amused by Dunne's constant name-dropping, then I was annoyed by it. By the end of the book I was laughing at it. Geez ...do you really think we care that Gus got a second row seat at Eva Gabor's funeral!!! Get a life."
5,A dishy look at the OJ trial vis a vis the Hollywood scene.,"As a woman, I've always viewed the O.J. murder trial as gender-based, not race-based. And upon the reading of the verdict, I felt betrayed and abandoned by our justice system and the people of this country. This book, as written by an author I already admire and enjoy, made me feel vindicated - as well as wickedly fascinated - when he gave voice to the complex feelings I felt while at the same time focusing on the deeply layered relationships and personal histories within the entertainment industry.Bravo, Dominick!"
1,"Man, was this BAD!","Having read in VANITY FAIR Mr. Dunne's intriging and insightful musings on the Simpson trial, I was very much looking forward to this novel. What a disappointment! Silly and tedious, self-absorbed -- with a laugh-out-loud ending too goofy to believe. Do yourself a big favor and buy ANYTHING else Mr. Dunne has written, but skip this wasted effort. (I had to rate the book at least one star for the review to be kept. Actually, it's worth zero.)"
4,I love name dropping and I love Gus,"This book is a fascinating expansion of the the trial that gripped America for all those months. My interest was instantly aroused via the Vanity Fair articles by Mr Dunne. The Book - well yes - lots of name dropping and party dropping but hey - if you live it - why not report it - life's too short to be humble - I, for one, am fascinated. Mr Dunne is welcome at my humble table any day of the week."
5,Bought this instant security system for my office,"I bought a Lasershield Security System to protect my small office which has expensive computers and valuable client files - I got my monitoring service activated right away, and I have to say it works just great! The keychain remote arm/disarm is very simple. My wife went into the office without disarming, and the monitoring service called me immediately to notify of a breach in security - this works as good, if not better, than our ADT system in our last house - much easier anyway not having to punch in a code everytime. Highly recommend this product, and I am going to get another for my new house."
1,Useless Piece of Junk.,"Alarm system works better as a paperweight. Handheld transmitters don't have enough range to be useful, infrared detector false-alarms constantly (and alerts the monitoring service, who calls the cops, who charge a false alarm fee in my community). Customer service from company is essentially nonexistant.Units are cheaply made in china.Don't waste your money."
2,Would be a good product if the alarm was loud.,"the product was easy to set up and very easy to use. However, I was quite disappointed when I heard the alarm. It was about as loud as my alarm clock. I read another reviewer on Amazon who complained that alarm was not loud and I though maybe he/she was exaggerating. Once I heard the alarm go off during the test I knew the item would not work as a deterrent. Certainly it is loud enough to wake the home owner at night; but, not loud enough to scare away the intruder or alert the neighbor. If the manufacturer redesign the system with ear piercing alarm that can scare away the intruder then it would be a low cost good alarm. Unfortunately it falls very short."
1,craptacular,"I ordered this product from another website. The product itself is cheap and clunky. The motion detector was terribly inefficient as it could not detect my 100lb son entering or exiting the room when activated. In the middle of the night the alarm must have went off because when I awoke, the voice in the box said the alarm sounded overnight. The siren is so low I could not hear it over the noise of the fan that I had running in my room and I sleep very lightly....Don't settle on this product, KEEP SEARCHING! Though I live in a rental unit, ADT was more than happy to install a wireless system in my home. You may have to get permissions from the property owner but it is worth the extra effort to do so."
1,Wrong product,The product is not a pop up emitter. Rather it is a grate that permits entry of ground water.
2,Screw heads break off,"These smoke alarms looked like a good buy, but when we tried to install them (using a manual screwdriver), the screw heads broke off in our ceiling, leaving the shanks embedded in the wood. We removed them with pliers (with some difficulty) and then installed the alarms with new screws of our own. The poor qualilty of the screws caused us an unreasonable amount of extra work and frustration. We have not had the alrarms long enough to comment on their longevity."
5,Compact Smoke Detector,"I'm sure this must be a wonderful item, but I failed to comprehend the word ""compact"" and, therefore, these four detectors were too small for the present openings in my ceilings.Instead of returning them, I donated them to a few needy families."
5,"Small, cheap, good made","I've bout couple of these for $4 each and was worrying that they are too cheap, but that was the only small model in store. But these are amazingly well made with good instruction. Installation is really easy and battery is included. Will buy more - with this cheap and small unit I really can afford to install smoke alarm in every room."
4,Inexpensive and fucntional,"You can buy more expensive versions of these, but for general use... say if you had one really good carbon monoxide/smoke/fire detector and a couple of these in the other rooms... they work great. They do go off with a very loud noise that will certainly wake you. They test easy. And they chirp if they are low on batteries. (They take a 9 volt that comes with it!) It's a good brand and they work fine."
2,Lacrosse Technology Projection Alarm 512 OU,Not happy at all. Product was opened when received. Cheap plastic construction - been trying but read-outs seem inaccurate. Overpriced.Am going to return and ask for refund. Do not recommend buying.
1,Worthless,The exterior temperature device did not work...The projectedtime was a round blur on the ceiling that could not be read...do not recommend you waste your time or money...I had to giveit one star because the review would not continue without anyrating...but really would rate it zero stars...Returned unit...
4,Wish it was a little brighter.,"Has lots of great features. The red display on the ceiling is great if the room is totally dark, but as it gets nearer to dawn, it is hard to see. I wish it had an adjustment to make it brighter. The outside temp feature is great as I plan what to wear for the day."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased this projection clock for 2 reasons. 1)to project an image sharp and large enough to read without my glassses. 2) to get the outside temperature in the morning.Unfortunately threr are 2 problems with the projection. It is barely large enough to read without glasses and it is only visible in the darkest room. Therefore, it is nearly worthless to me."
2,"Projection Clock ""Lite""","I had an Oregon Scientific projection clock that stopped working after many years. While this does this job, barely, the magnification is smaller than I was used to and the clock is light so it is easily tipped over on a nightable."
3,Not Bad,"It's A nice alarm clock, don't get me wrong. It's got a wireless outdoor theromter and ir runs on batteries. Don't really use the projection feature and the led isn't blue it'e green but it's still visible at night. Cool features such as indoor/outdoor temp, and humidity are nice to have espcially out here in afghanistan."
2,Only works for half the day,"This seemed like it was going to be a great product: a self-updating chronometer with indoor/outdoor temperature readings and a projection display.Unfortunately this DIGITAL clock is unable to count to 24 (from 00:00 to 23:59)-- and so it can only display an accurate time half of each day! The 'self updating' feature doesn't work worth a damn, either-- the unit doesn't seem to be able to get the right time zone or whether DST should be applied or not. Worthless piece of shit."
2,has some problems,This alarm clock has some problems since the hour keep changing even after we adjust it many times.it doesn't show the outdoor temperature.I was a bit disappointed with it and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends
5,La Crosse Technology WT-5120U Projection Alarm Clock with Outdoor Temperature,I got this clock for my husband for Christmas and he just loves it. He asked for an outside temp. clock and it is so nice to wake up in the morning and just look at the outdoor temp. and time on our ceiling as soon as we open our eyes. It also tells you the indoor temp. so we always know what is going on. I would strongly recommend this product.Thank you.
3,"Love the function, not the look","This was a great gift for a family friend. He loves waking up able to easily read the time and outdoor temperature on the wall. However, I was not impressed with the cheap plasicky look of the clock itself."
3,Okay but not great.,"I like most of the features on this projection clock. I don't like how the display is not backlit; but since I was warned of this by reading others' reviews, I can't complain about it. However, I wasn't anticipating how lightweight the clock would be. I have indoor cats who love to walk on my nightstand at night. All it takes is a gentle swish of their tails and the clock is on the floor. Obviously, that doesn't work too well. My old clock radio still works so I plan on using the two clocks together. I'll place the projection clock out of reach of the cats and use it strictly for its projection feature and continue to use my old clock for its alarm and backlight features."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I had an older model from La Crosse that worked well for years. When it died, I bought a new one. Got it... and it doesn't work. Display comes on... but no buttons work, does not communicate with temperature transmitter. So they sent another. The buttons work on the second one... you do have to push on them several times to get them to work, but hey... they work...but still no outside temperature. After going through the setup process several times, doing it exactly as explained, still no communication with the transmitter. I have two family members who have had similar problems with the newer models. I wouldn't waste the time or money on this. Do yourself a favor and don't waste yours."
2,"Okay,but too small.","The clock works well,but is really too small,and the projection only works well in dimly lit locations. It also has to be at some optimal distance from the wall to actually see the numbers.It does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it close to a wall."
4,Projection Clock/Temperature,"Very good clock - I had one before from another company, and had a lot of difficulty with the temperature projection - this one is working quite well."
2,poor projection display,"clock is fine, the display on the ceiling 6' from the clock is only 2"" tall and not real bright."
2,very bad product,"very bad product, yes it's not expensive, but why would you waste your money for something you're not gonna use? picture quality is very poor, zooming, and backlight is very bad, shortly, not worth a penny."
1,Temperature projection failed,"It did not take long for the temperature sensor to fail. I replaced batteries in both units, sending and receiving, but it still doesn't display or project the outside temperature, only the time."
2,Not a good product to buy,Showing incorrect outdoor temp. and alarm won't work sometimes .It is not a reliable product
1,Warranty is worthless,The AC adapter died after 2 months. They do not respond to any of my emails. Their telephone number does not answer. They appear to be out of business.
4,It is a good value,"We've had ours for 2 weeks and really do enjoy it. The projection part is really nice to have although you can not see it in the day time. Otherwise, everything is good."
4,Perfect for sleeping!,"This product is great at night, when you don't want to turn over to check out what time it is when you're in bed. I have the time projecting on the ceiling so all I have to do is look up without moving. The projection is bright enough to see at night with maybe the glow of street lights going through the window, but no where near bright enough to disturb your sleep. The outdoor tempature is accurate, and I have the sensor out on the deck and the display in my 2nd floor bedroom. I did notice that the best way to sync the display with the sensor is to either do it next to a sliding glass door or outside, but once you have it sync'd, you can move the display anywhere you want in the house and still get a reading. The time and outdoor temperature does alternate, so sometimes I find myself waiting a second for the temperature reading to turn to time, but it's really not a big deal."
3,No middle ground,"I like it, however it has to be very dark or very bright to be able to see the time."
5,Great at night.,Love the time and temperature that is projected overhead at night. Very accurate. Makes a great gift for anyone and everyone has enjoyed this.
1,Projection,"I'm sure this is a fine clock, like many others. I bought it thinking that I would be able to read the time on the ceiling. Unfortunately, the projection is so faint and small that I can't read it without my glasses on! I have been looking for a clock with a large, clear projection and they don't seem to exist anymore; probably due to children safety. Anyway, I returned it."
5,Purchaser,"I like this product because when I first wake up in the morning I see the time and outside temperature on the ceiling. I love it, except when it is so cold outside I want to stay in bed.JP"
2,Clock,Not what was expected. Clock is not easy to program. External tempeture device does not transmit far enough.
2,not excellent,I finially got part of it working. Never have gotten the ouside temp to work. Not real happy with it.
2,"It can tell you the temp, but it won't WAKE you!","I bought this because a needed a new alarm clock, excited that it told outdoor temp. Temp works GREAT, but the alarm is so soft, you can barely hear it awake. My advice, find another clock."
5,"perfect clock, but too complicate","This clock has completely satisfy me, but its complexcity to set up the time and everything else. It is hard, though, if I lost my manual. But with a manual, it is very easy.good watch"
1,Horrible clock,"This is a horrible clock I ordered it and disposed of the packing to get it into the garbage then set it all up and could not even see the red lighting on the ceiling I tried to fix it but to no avail I called and explained the problem to the LaCrosse company they told me it was not adjustable and I could purchase another from them that would be.... NO thanks!!!! my only mistake was not keeping the packaging,as then I would have returned it to Amazon...buyer beware if you want a clock you can read DO NOT buy a LaCrosse especially this model."
3,Nice Unit,"Nice little unit, works well, however the display is quite dim and has to be in a very dark room. If it is slightly light in the morning you just can't see the display. But it does work well."
1,Frustrating,An old Oregon Scientific finally kicked off after years of great use. Ordered this because we still wanted red light display. The display is not strong enough to be readable. The time won't sync accurately. Returning product and will order an OR Sci item.
5,Great detailed general basic guide to the world's financial markets,"If you have money that is invested, and you want to learn more about the basics of the different financial markets then this is the book. It covers nearly all the different financial markets and gives a good amount of detail to how they work, what common used words mean and important history about that market.A must read for all Beginning-Intermediate investors or speculators interested in finance/investing."
4,Shocking Awe,"Rollins recounts his USO experiences, performing in Afghanistan for U.S. troops. Ever the gadfly of the Bush administration's confused, contradictory conservatism, he spells out a truth so obvious but no one every acknowledges -- the soldiers fighting over there are not the same as those who send them over there, and no matter what side of the political divide you ride, and if your against any war or policy or administrator, the very reason your AGAINST such is because your FOR the troops.His stories here as always vacillate between the humorous and the serious until the two are one and the same. More great cosmopolitan observations in a time when we're just beginning to get away from media casting everything as black or white when there are really more different shades of gray than could fill a one hundred crayon box of Crayolas with the sharpener in the back that featured nothing but different grays. Thanks again, Mr. Rollins."
4,Good textbook for theoretical and practical applications,"This book works well for theoretical and practical application. It have some sloppy typographical errors, which there is no excuse for because this is a 6th edition, but they're not large enough to effect the accuracy of the book. I am using this text for a metallurgy class at a local community college and there are a variety of students with different backgrounds and competencies, and they are all using this book effectively. I myself have a degree in mechanical engineering and am getting a lot of useful, new information from this book that I did not learn in my ME studies. There is a lot of good, practical information in this book that can be easily applied in real-world situations, and the theoretical portions of the book are explained in down-to-earth words that make it easy to grasp those more abstract portions."
2,obtuse,"I'm a GED teacher w/ a bs in geology and a ms in geological engineering who has gone back to school to earn an as in Welding Technology. I bought this book and another (""Metallurgy Fundamentals"", Brandt & Warner, Goodhart-Wilcox pub, 1999) to get up to speed on the metals I'm welding on and the effects welding has on those metals. Neely's book is obtuse in the extreme; unneccessarily hard to read, especially compared to Brandt & Warner's. Unless you're going for a degree in mechanical engineering or metallurgy, don't buy this book. On the other hand, if you enjoy writing a glossary as you read and have the time to cross-reference other books paragraph by paragraph, go for it. Oh, and the price of this book was four-times the price of Brandt & Warner's."
5,Great shaver!!,"I used to shave with a norelco about 10 year ago. Then my battery died and I switched to a blade. I can't believe this new shaver!!! It shaves much closer than a blade...no 5 o'clock shadow anymore! I also really like the battery display, how long the battery lasts for, and how quiet the shaver runs.If I had to choose something to gripe about, it would be that the hairs do not get cut on the first pass sometimes. You just have to have the patience to look closely in a mirror while you shave in order to make sure you cut every hair. This happened more in the first month of shaving...I have to say that the longer I've use it (it's been about 2 months now), the ""easier"" it gets to cut every hair.Overall, I'm very impressed and very happy. Worth every penny!!!"
2,Dark Tint-Not Fun,"The glasses were really dark when I received them. It was an unusual tint, I can barely see out of them. The price was cheap, however, so I think it was worth the payment. Also, delivery was great! Right on time!"
2,Good enough for halloween accessory,I bought these glasses for my halloween costume. They look great with the costume.The glasses themselves feel really cheap so you have to handle them carefully or it will most likely break. The lense look mirrored but in the inside they are really dark. These are exremely dark sunglasses!Overall they look nice but I figure with typical use they will not last long.
1,HORRIBLE!,"These glasses suck and I should have realized for such a cheap price, they would be horrible. The glasses were completely bent when I received them. You're better off going to a gas station and getting a pair for 12 bucks if you're looking for something cheap. If the packaging was a little better (probably amazon) they would be fine. Amazon won't send out another pair so it's not worth the hassle. I ended up trashing them."
5,earrings,"Just as described in the add. Beauffull setting. I would have liked a gift box, but it just came in a small velour bag."
3,Valentine's Day Gift,"I love the color but for some reason the backs aren't tight. I've gotten lots of complements on the color, I just wish the backs were tighter. It was my Valentine's Day gift that I got to choose myself."
2,Not what you would expect,Stiga is the original rod hockey game. This was not the original design. This had a thin playfield that was not sturdy and made the play not so good. This was a cheap version of the original. I plan to return this and by Franklin Sports version for half the price.
4,Really Fun!,"It's a really fun game. The players are detailed and look good. But there are a few quality issues. The player that can skate behind the goal has a tough time turning on my set, on both sides, and sometimes the players start to pop up, because they are interchangeable. But other than that, it is a very detailed set, and the sticks that the playeers hold are even metal! it's a blast, much more fun than foosball."
5,Great Game,"We got this as a Christmas gift for our 14 YO son. It has been a blast to play. It's kind of pricey but seems to be of good quality. The players are gear-driven rather than spring-driven so there is much less ""give"" in these players. They use a nifty little damper to keep the puck from hitting the back of the net and coming out - this avoids many discussions about whether the puck was in or not. The only issue we have had is that the players tend to ride upwards over the course of play. This results in the stick being too high off of the surface to hit the puck. You need to take a quick time out to reseat the players."
4,delightful Brooks film,"The Twelve Chairs is an entertaining short parody of a Russian film by a similar name. With a feel more like Brooks' ""The Producers"" (1968) rather than ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""Spaceballs,"" the movie is appropriate for the whole family."
5,Very Funny!,"I bought this movie last night without a doubt that It would be really funny, and it was!!!!! I recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh"
2,Hmong Means Free,"I had to read this book for a history course. It was interesting at the beginning, until I see the picture of my Hmong friends. The author is pretty bias in some part of her writting. There are no evidences to support her term of Hmong means free. We are not free people we fought for our freedom just like any other less dominance race. You can not base an accurate study of the Hmong Culture based on interviews with Hmong peers and students. Though I do find the quote of other authors pretty well worded. Although the Hmong did fight the Han-Chinese to reclaim their land, they never succeeded. Many Hmong philosophers were killed and written history were burned and destroyed by the Han- Chinese. There are no accurate documentation of Hmong history. All I have to say is, if a book is written about the Hmong, then I think its a new culture and race being created."
2,Not one of Parker's better efforts...,"This 1992 release is not one of Parker's better efforts. It lacks the biting anger you might normally expect from him. The one exception is the Richie Haven's sounding ""Here It Comes Again"", with some excellent lyrics about our privacy being invaded which would be a timely release today with the Patriot Act and all. Another strong song is ""Love Is A Burning Question"" which sounds like classic Graham Parker. But there's not much else here to hold onto."
3,documentary,"Good blu ray, but too much of a documentary. It should have included at least part of a complete concert, not just bits and pieces!"
5,Cooper/Muse,"I enjoyed both movies. ""Broken Strings"" was especially nice as it taught a good lesson. It's good to be able to see these pioneers do what they did for their time and the generations to come."
5,"Little batteries, Big power","I use these batteries in my digital camera. Got them not long ago, it works a long time in the camera. Longer than my old 900m ones. I use the old 900m ones in my remotes now, those doesn't require as much power usage.Switched to all rechargeable batteries to be more eco-friendly. Many people still buy the batteries at $0.99 store which lasts very short time and end up as hazard trash. I hope the manufactures can ship the products such as remotes with the rechargeable batteries to promote it."
3,"i agree, but kurtz makes it difficult","to me, kurtz has the right ideas. but his tone in explaining the ideas, by bashing his 'opponents', rather than justifying himself with some sort of evidence, seems counter-productive. i'm not very well read on the subject, but i hope that somewhere out there there is something better than this. if not, i might just have to reconsider; he really doesn't respond well to questions that would be posed by the theist."
2,clock,"The last La Crosse atomic clock that I had was wonderful and I had it for over 7 years. Unfortunately I dropped it and couldn't put it back together again. I bought this one because it is almost the same clock. (A little different).But this clock will not keep the right time. I am in the PST. It would not auto set and then when I do set it, it will not stay on the correct time. It keeps moving ahead two hours. I have reset three times. I am about to throw it out the front door. I hate paying for something that will not work correctly!!!!"
2,"Good clock, until the works quit working","I bought one of these nice looking, accurate clocks about 18 months ago. That clock had to go back to the factory under warranty when the second hand stopped working. They cheerfully sent me a brand new clock. Now, 8 months later, the second hand has stopped on the replacement clock. Obviously, this clock is not made up to standards of other La Crosse clocks. It's disconcerting to look at a perfect time keeper where the second hand is frozen -- it doesn't seem trustworthy once that happens. I guess I will replace it with a digital clock that has no moving parts."
1,"Bad Service, Bad product, Bad Luck","I bought the LA CROSS WT-3161 (Analog Clock) for my office. Apparently the product arrived BROKEN, as it never worked. (Maybe this damage was caused during shippment, as it was stored not appropiately inside a box). The service was awful, as I contacted the seller and amazon through email and never got a response.I am having 2nd thoughts of purchase security through AMAZON as this case I have never recieved any help from either the store or the sender.P.S. The product is of CHEAP hardware quality, and logically CHEAPER durability, as mine did not even make it through shippment."
1,this is disgraceful as a RHCP fan,"How can they put out a live album with this setlist?? Two songs from before Californication and they are Under the Bridge and Give It Away. Pathetic. This is the worst setlist possible for such a great funky band before By the Way came out. By the Way is horrible. If you want some real Chili Peppers, listen to Blood Sugar and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Uplift album brought the funk and fun together. You can't get any better than closing an album with Organic Anti-Beat Box Band besides Sr. Psycho Sex. I just looked and aw that is an import and it will cost you stupid people 22 bucks to buy it. Have fun listening to this. I know I won't."
5,The Best Live Band Makes The Best Live Album,"This is without a doubt the best live recording i have ever heard by any band, the beauty of Flea and John jamming out in between several tracks is just so moving. And the new songs Rolling Sly Stone and Leverage of Space are so far up to par with anything else i have heard from rhcp. Get this album now."
5,This is the Australian Import,"Same as the other one, only cheaper. This CD is amazing, how could they keep this one from the US market? Oh well, thank god for imports. If your a fan, buy it NOW!!"
3,Just average,"What to say? I was thinking this would be a superb recording from a superb band. But what I got was something quite different.My main issue is the sound quality. The band sounds like they are playing on four seperate stages, they dont sound like a band at all, more like four people just jamming. This is glaringly obvious in the first song 'Cant Stop', this is one of my favourite Chilis songs and its just bad here. John sounds like he is out of time and is trying to catch up to the rest of the band.The other main issue is Anthonys vocals. Theyre just bad, as if he'd just woken up after a night on the booze.Im glad I only borrowed this cd, I was thinking about buying it and Im glad I didnt waste my money"
5,"Great, Great, Great, Great,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Wow! Jude Watson really knows how to make a WHOPPER of a book! Everything about this novel was astounding! GREAT cover, GREAT characters, GREAT drama, GREAT EVERYTHING!!! What a decision at the end! Personally, I would've stayed on Melida/Daan to help out Cerasi, Nield, & the rest of the Young. Speaking of Cerasi, is it just me or do I see ROMANCE between her & Obi-Wan!!"
4,Kit has Everything needed to clean wood floors.,"Everything worked well but if you already have a Mr. Clean terry cloth floor cleaning mop/duster, it would work just as well. I have alternated using each. The cleaner works very well."
2,not my favorite,didn't like the way my floors looked at all after I was done mopping. I was looking for something to get rid of the dull appearance my floors have after several years of kids and animals beating up on them. I think they actually looke even more dull and flat than before I mopped. Lots of visible streaking and just didnt look like they were just cleaned or polished. I ended up buying the SHARK actually and was much happier with that
3,WORKS WELL,Product works well but the applicator is probably the best part of the kit. Velcro attachments make it easy to install and remove pads which are machine washable and quality products. The liquid cleaner is OK but I'm not sure it's any better than other quality wood floor cleaners. All in all a better product than swiffer for wood floors.
3,Under the Tuscan Sun,"Amy's Tuscan Bean and Rice Soup is an attempt to evoke the sunny Northern Italian countryside, with its vineyards and villas. It tastes okay with some Parmesan on it, but it lacks the usual Italian zest. The combination of rice and beans is hearty (making a complete protein). It IS a ""soup that eats like a meal."" Unfortunately, it would probably taste better if it were made fresh.Amy's Organic soups tend to be very good. Get her Thai soup instead, if you want to spice things up."
1,Not good,"I really like some of Amy's organic soups. However, I thought this was pretty awful. I couldn't even finish one bowl. It was sort of greasy and had that canned soup taste... like preservatives or something. Yuck."
3,Good soup - bad can condition,"About a quarter of the case of soup cans arrived in damaged condition. This soup was purchased for rainy day/storage and or disaster conditions. Beans and rice combined make perfect protein.With the damaged cans however, many cans have to be consumed now, if at all. These cans weren't dented, they were crushed. I don't like the idea of eating the metal from the cans mixed in with the soup.Excellent soup from Amy's, but Amazon, get it together with your shipping. It's not right to sell your customer's damaged goods."
3,Earrings,The earrings arrived in a few days and I gave them as a gift. The receiver liked them very much
4,Its An OK Piece.,"Its Alright, but has issues such as: you have to pull the trigger ALL THE WAY back to shoot and you have to do it fast or else the bb will fall out the barrel.Another issue is this gun is vitally dependant on a little delicate spring inside the slide which works with the hammer to strike the C02 fo fire the gun. If this spring gets damaged the gun won't work properly and you can't replace the spring.Other than that i'm giving this 4 stars because this airgun is made of steel and looks realistic like a real 9mm pistol,the C02/loading device pops out the bottom like a magazine,and the top of the gun slides back before firing just like on real guns.Its a good air pistol and it works,just be advised though of those two problems this gun could have."
4,So awesome for the rental car,"I don't know if I would use this in my daily driver. I use the adhesive strips there. This works great if you are in a rental car, company car, or if you are in your out of state friends car. Install is easy, removal is slightly more difficult. The suction cups don't give up easy, so sometimes you have to slide it out the key hole and then remove the suction cup from the glass.It has 2 problems I have noticed. On especially hot days, I have had it fall of the windsheild. Also if you car has a vibration, it can rattle. These are the 2 reasons, I don't use it in my car."
1,Useless... Absolutely Useless..,Cannot believe i spent a penny buying this worthless product.. It just wont stick to the glass.. Save your money.. Buy something else..
2,Melted,So it worked great as long as the EZPass device stayed in it. When I took the device out and left the hold on the glass it warped and I could never get it the device to fit in it again. Just terrible with holding up to the elements.
2,Doesn't work in extreme heat/cold,"I bought two of these, one for my car and one for my husband's. Both lasted about 2 years. They do not work well in the summer/winter when the car gets very hot/cold (I live in MA). The tabs that hold the suction cups melt during the day in the summer and become deformed. Once the plastic cools, you cannot bend/shape it back. I still have some plastic stuck to my floor mat where holder landed after it melted off my window and later cooled in the evening (the suction cup was still on the window). During the winter, the suction cups do not hold well in extreme cold so every morning I needed to put it back on my window after the car warmed a little."
4,A picture book of The Constitution,"The book recites the very basic facts of the summer of 1787 and the beginning job of putting the Constitution to work, such as electing a president.I think it is a good intro resource,but may be a little dull. I teach secial ed on the high school level(EH/LD)it is hard to keep their attention. I often use picture books to support or introduce a topic. The kids are on different reading levels and I often give them scavenger hunts and encourage the use of all books and resources I bring in,so they are not embaressed. The book has additional informational list in back. I think this is an adequate addition to my resource library."
5,Exercise bike,"I found this bike easy to ride. It has many nice features. My husband was able to assemble it without any trouble. He is not a natural handy man so the fact that it went together with ease is a major plus. I agree with other reviews that this bike functions as well as the higher priced one. The additional cost for the next level only provided bell and whistles. The function is the same.One feature I really like about this bike is that if you don't reset the gauges, it continues with the last workout numbers so you can keep track of several days worth of work."
3,"Great Product, Terrible Shipping!","I recently ordered this bike after testing it out at a local sporting goods store. The bike arrived quickly, but was damaged. There was a large crack in the plastic casing around the pedals. Amazon quickly sent out a replacement and arranged for pickup of the item. The second unit arrived and had a crack in the same exact spot. Amazon would not send out another unit and arranged for pickup of this item and game me a refund. I had to go back to the sporting goods store and buy it there. Luckily, it was on sale for $50 cheaper than Amazon. The bike works great now that I have it. Very quiet operation and easy to use."
1,BEWARE,I HAVE ALREADY RETURNED THIS PRODUCT. AMAZON HAS CREDITED MY ACCOUNT. THE BIKE WHICH REQUIRED ALMOST TWO HOURS TO ASSEMBLE WAS DEFECTIVE. IT CLANGED IN THE LEFT FOOT 10 O CLOCK POSITION. EVERYTHING I READ IMPLIED THAT IT IS A DEFAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER--CHINA. IT IS ONLY A SCHWINN BY NAME AND NOT OF THE QUALITY OF MANY YEARS AGO.
5,Great Purchase,"I was hesitant to purchase this bike because so many people buy excersise equipment, cancel their gym membership and never use the product. I have used this bike often, it was easy to assemble (So I hear, my boyfriend did this for me) it is very quite and there is great resistence. I find that it is as sturdy and comfortbale as the very expensive models in my gym. This also takes less room then a big bulky treadmill, it is sleek looking and takes up hardly any space, I have it in a corner looking out into my yard. By adjusting the tension you can get a really good hard work out of you want to. I am very happy with my purchase.There is another model that is a little less with out the computer board and monitors but I find the results of calories burned etc to be very helpful and inspirational."
1,Poor packing,"The first item arrived completely damaged. The UPS guy assured me that everything inside was metal and it survived the journey - despite the package appearance. After hauling it down to my basement, I took it out to assemble - and as other reviwers noted - the plastic around the flywheel was broken. Ordered a replacement - that was very quickly dispatched by Amazon via Fedex. This time, the packaging seemed to be intact, but the same plastic piece was broken. The manufacturer needs to do a better job protecting the plastic part..The packing material around the metal parts seems to be fine, if not overdone...Had to haul both bikes up a floor, to my garage so that UPS can pick it up to be returned - giving me a back-ache. Completely disappointed with the experience. All I am gonna do now is wait for a refund....Update - 01/31/2009 - Received my refund..Thanks Amazon.!"
5,Solid and quiet,"I am a runner and plan to use this twice a week for cross-training, to maintain cardio fitness while reducing impact on my poor old joints. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and have no issues. It's quiet, feels very well-built, and it takes less room than the treadmill.Assembly was fairly straight-forward. Everything you need is included.It would be nice if the display were back-lit, but that's a very minor quibble. Even though my vision is not great, I can read the display well enough.Shipping was speedy and free (Amazon Prime). The cardboard was slightly damaged, but everything inside was in perfect shape. Amazon is the first place I look for just about anything these days."
1,No Quality in Shipping & Returns Department,"Like other similar reviews, I also received a disaster of a box and reluctantly wrapped it as a Christmas present, hoping all the parts were in the box. Well, after Christmas dinner, proceeded to attempt to assemble bike only to find numerous parts missing. I'm just hoping I don't have to carry it back down stairs and rebox it.The Shipping Department at this seller must have no quality control on how items go out the door or how items are checked upon return (its obvious this had been previously been opened).I only wish I could report on how the bike operates."
2,Disappointed,"I would have thought that would have corrected the poor visibility of the display with this upgraded model but they did not. Impossible to read from riding position, almost impossible to read after stopping and leaning forward. Poor organization and labelling, and very little contrast.Also there is a problem with the flimsy seat mounting bar as any speed above about 8 mph, with a 6 foot tall person on it, sets up a loud squeaking that overwhelms any entertainment system sound. Resonant frequency problem with weight/height and poorly engineered mounting.Very disappointed in this chinese schwinn.NOT a best buy."
5,Great Bike!,Did a lot of searching and comparing. Bought this bike based on reviews and Schwinn history and reputation. Assembly was easy with an assistant. It does everything I need and then some. Highly recommended!
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,This bike is a great excercise tool for those who can't get out. I ride this everyday and it is very quiet. It is made solid so I expect this to last me a long time. My previous bike broke after 6 months but I did not buy it through Amazon.The only drawback is it is difficult to assemble. You really should have two people.
5,Love it,"No problems. We had it professionally ($50,00)installed and it has been perfect from the start."
3,"Dogs love them, but not very healthy ingredients....","My dogs have always loved these treats, and I do buy them, but only on occasion,as they are made with alot of unhealthy ingredients that humans are warned to stay away from.But they are good for occasional treats that give my dogs variety, and I use them at the Humane Society where I work. You can befriend dogs really easily with these ;-)"
5,Tschuess to Philadelphia,"I believe elmoderno saw some forein films, but it was obviously useless for him. He didn't understand a word in the film. This is the reason why most of Russians laughing at Americans adolescence maximalism and inability to think about and understand really deep and serious European films. They can't even hide their narrow-mindedness, as we can see. Every person can read the texts (it can be texts in the books and in the films and anywhere else as well - all our world is the text for reading and understanding) using some interpretative codes, which he has by force of his education and his environment. So this is not the question of Wim Wenders absolute Genius - this is the problem of personal ability for reading and understanding the meanings which contain the text (the film in this case)!"
3,"Better Ergo's needed,","Although this router does the job it was intended to do I found the ergonomics wanting. The opening that you work in to change the bit is small for someone with large hands. The handles are hard and slippery, they need some larger knobs with a grippier surface. The tool has a smooth motor and I was able to make depth adjustments easily. I bought this Hitachi to be dedicated to a dovetail jig. Although it would probably be o.k. for standard shop router, I will not continue to use it on the dovetail jig."
5,Bangin is as Bangin does......,"If you love to dance, then you will love Bangin 3. DJ Escape transports you into the nightclub state of mind with his amazing mixing technique of today's hottest tracks that will make your feet stomp and your booty wiggle.Big thumbs up for DJ escape"
3,"Some good ideas, but not really my style","This was little over the top. Focusing too much on having ceromonies, and making a big deal out of everything. The idea is a little to extroverted for me. yes, some ceromonies are important, but they lose their meaning if you have too many, and I feel the book was focused to much on having the ceromony that the process of getting to the ceromony."
3,A Good Book but Not Great,"It is rather hard to explain this book. It is almost as if, when reading through this book, it should move you and encourage you to what the title is encouraging. But as you get through the book it seems a bit detached. The author has a very good theme and can draw from history and personal experience to support his premise but then the book seems to fail in motivating with real data and challenges in how to ""raise a modern-day night."" In the end I would recommend the book for any reader who is wanting to round out their study of mentoring and developing for younger people or children. But if you are looking for a book that gives you raw data and some expert opinions on the challenges facing our youth this book will come off ""thin."" A good book for motivational purposes but not much more than that."
3,GOOD ENTERTAINMENT-DECENT PRICE,"Found these at WalMart, Today's american favorite.Anyway, they were priced under 10 bucks and contained some older movies, plus a few Tex Ritters and at least one Buck Jones, which I like. Takes me back to the matinees at the local Bijou when a kid.Transfers are no worse than the old TV prints I used to watch, so it I consider it a bargain all round. 47 hours of ""white hats versus black hats"". Just don't expect too much for your money and you will no doubt be satisfied. All are glorious black and white, medium of the earlier time, with only one film, I Killed Wild Bill Hickok, in color. At least they got ""Hickok"" correct. This is a 12 disc set, I was born in '43 and most of these pre date me! Good to see what my parents watched.Let r roll, buckaroos."
2,NICE BUT....,Nice checkbook wallet but the zipper was not locked in d end. I screwed up upon openning it. I was so mad! I returned it. Hopefully the factory will realized zipper should be tied up for safe purposes. It was too small for our checking book but it is nice wallet.
1,Too Many Great Haiku Poets Left Out,"Like Mr. van den Heuvel's other editions of this anthology, several of the true ""greats"" of haiku have been left out. The book disappoints in its lack of real inclusiveness. The editor's spotlight shines far too brightly on a certain few and fails to touch some of the most important poets in the genre's history."
5,Why I bought PS2,"I am a big fan of ""The World of Outlaws"" and when I heard this game was coming out I went out and bought a PS2. I have yet to get tired of this game, endless fun and the best career mode to date."
1,This is Amazon's fault! : (,I wish they were more clear in the description of this and that they actually had the product pictured! I ordered these thinking they were the hanging file folders in the picture.:(
5,Great game for kids,We got this game for our boys for Christmas and they love it. Lots of unexpected humor and creativity that is perfect for kids as well as adults who grew up with these movies.
4,Nice size,"The bandages stick quite well and ad a good fit. With my mitts it's hard to find this size in the store. They could be a hair wider so they fit a little better around my thumb, but I have no complaints."
2,Not brush for me,"The bristles are not strong. They started to bend after first brushing. My dog, Gracie, is a Havanese and I need something that will go through her hair not pull it out."
4,"A lovely romance, a catchy mystery...","As the last of the Bar Cynster takes his fall all hell breaks loose around him. Of course, he IS a Cynster so I guess we can expect no less. I have been waiting for this book for months and it was all I expected and more! The book has everything I look for in a romance rolled into one. I highly recommend it. It is a must read for Laurens' fans..."
2,All About Love,"I have read all of the previous Cynster novels, and was somewhat disapointed with this one. I found it to be extrememly slow, and somewhat boring. I enjoy Regency novels for the fun of putting myself in the shoes of the lead characters, and trying to imagine life that revloves around balls, routs, and houseparties. The fun of Regency novels is not only the main characters, but also of the suportting characters and the way they live thier lives. There were no balls, no real supporting characters, and in my opinion, the setting in the countryside was boring. I enjoy reading before bed, and a good book is one that I start at 10 PM and finish at 1 AM. This book lastest me almost a week, because it was so easy to put down each night after only one or two chapters."
3,ALL ABOUT LOVE?,"Sorry, people but you might want to pass on this one. Why? Well to start with our hero, who is called Lucifer is not the bad boy that he sounds like. However, the leading lady, Phyllida is well written. The mystery of who killed poor Horatio drags out too long. I found myself wondering when it would end, find the murder all ready!Hope this helps."
3,All About Love,"The name Stephanie Laurens is enough reason for me to buy her books without hesitation. So far this is the only book by Stephanie Laurens , that did not keep me engrossed. It definitely did not have the impact as most of her novels do, the passionate coupling and the sparks that fly between her characters was somehow missing......."
4,"Solid, easy drive","I really like the versatility and ease of use of this drive. It is a little heavy to be used as a truly portable drive, but if you're just gonna be occasionally carting it around, it works great. I use it for video editing, and the seek times are actually better than my internal HD.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I had to format it before I could use it the first time. The computer recognized it automatically as soon as I plugged it in, but I couldn't use it until I formatted (which is a simple two-click operation, but kinda annoying because you then have to wait half an hour before you can use your drive). I'm using Windows XP - I've heard Mac users say they were ready to go immediately.All in all a great drive. Planning to pick up the 200-GB version for video archiving - I heard the cases stack together easily, so we'll see."
1,worst transfer I ever saw,This is NOT a review! We all know how wonderful this classic noir is but WHY oh WHy must we put up with these dreadful transfers? There should be some kind of law against questionable organisations issuing such bad quality DVDs. Why on earth can Paramount or Universal not put out a proper good print if this movie?I want to appeal to Amazon to withdraw this dreadful - and pricy too - DVD from their books and I am returning the copy they sent me for a full refund. Disgracefulcopy of any movie to send to anyone! My own copy of a TV recording is 100 times better.AMAZON PLEASE HAVE SOME QUALITY CONTROL AND EXAMINE EACH MOVIE BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THE MARKET FOR SALE.A very disappointed Amazon customer.
1,Warning: Poor resolution. Image reduced. Logo lower right corner.,"Warning: Poor resolution. Image reduced. Logo lower right corner.For: ""The File On Thelma Jordon"" (1950)DVD Release Date: October 20, 2011ASIN: B005XPB2FOPoor ""Manufactured on Demand"" DVD image resolution transfer.The Full Screen Image size has been reduced with 2 inch gray bars at the top and bottom with 2 inch black bars on both sides. I tried to zoom in to get rid of the bars but the top gray bar remained and the picture quality was way too blurry to even watch.The annoying Cable TV ""Mystery"" Logo would suddenly appear during the most important parts of the movie.Overall - Very irritating for a movie that cost $12.985 Stars - for this movie - a great work of Film Noir.1 Star - for the DVD transfer."
2,These are not the size indicated. Be carefull purchasing these.,"These are 14mm, not 15mm. in SAE terms, these are 9/16 bore, not 5/8. i had to drill these out, which makes the keyway not the correct size, but it was either that, or return them, with a project waiting to be completed.Brian, Troy Michigan"
5,ya think i'd know better,"coco mantoya is one bad man remine me of myself. I love his blues I was raised on the blues, my farther and I was close and he was a blues man like father like son. I GET IN THAT CORVETTE OF MNE AND PUT IN SOME COCOit do not get any better than that."
2,doesn't work long term.,This made my dog stop barking for about a day and a half before it stopped bothering him. I can't find any kind of replacement spray that's any stronger either. Don't waste your money.
4,Jaco Live and Outstanding!,This Dvd is respectable and show Jaco in the era of the Word of Mouth Big Band Orchestra. Jaco plays brilliantly and the quality of the session is very good.A must have for all fusion and jazz collectors and fans.
2,neverending chemical stench,"This product produced a glorious, gleaming, awe-inspiring shine -- however, it also came with a horrendous chemical stench. The couple of days were awful, but I was certain it would completely dissipate within a few days. Nearly a month later the chemical stench has not quelled all that much.Oddly enough, the generic floor wax I usually purchased from a dollar store does not leave any smell behind at all. The cheap stuff takes more coats to achieve a similar shimmer, but it doesn't burn my eyes and sinuses and lungs; doesn't leave behind a never-ending smell of chemical doom.I seriously regret trying this product."
1,Buyer beware! Misrepresented Fraud!,"RIP OFF Alert! Received four 5.7oz bottles for Christmas. Just opened the first only to find something nowhere close to the British Sterling Cologne I've used for over forty years. What I found is a nauseating, putrid piss yellow liquid that I would never touch bare handed much less put on my face. This is NOT the British Sterling any longtime user is expecting. It should be criminal for Amazon to allow this seller online. Where do I file a formal complaint? No return allowed since I didn't find the fraud until after 30 days."
3,didn't meet my expectations,Didn't meet my expectations. I wanted a book that would help me preserve my handmade things. It didn't cover that much.
5,Best Tomato Soup Ever !,"I just got back from a trip to England where I had the most wonderful homemade tomato soup at a tearoom in Ashburton, Devon. I thought I would never find anything to equal this homemade soup. I bought a can of Amy's Organic Chunky Tomato Bisque and one sip of this heavenly soup and I knew I had found something just as good if not better than the homemade soup in Devon, England. I have now been adding some fresh Basil to this awesome soup!!!. I hope that Amy's never changes their recipe for this excellent fresh tasting soup."
5,Great!!,"I thought this book was excellent. Even though it seems many people so not share this opinon. I think either you hate this book or you love it. Caitlin was an awesome character, and i kept reading for her. The flashbacks were, a little long, but interesing and they explained more aboudt the characters"
1,YAWN!!!,"I bought this book since the story synopsis sounded interesting. AND, I'm sure it could be if half the descriptive narratives were removed. Jumping around between characters, present-day and past rememberances left me feeling very disjointed. I couldn't get a feel for the characters either.I haven't finished reading the book yet, and can't decide if I'll spend any more time on it. I'm glad I didn't buy the hardcover edition.I have just one question. Did anyone bother to edit the book for content?? Maybe I'm the only one who finds it extremely BORING. YAWN!!!"
1,Dreadful - little dialogue - not a book for the beach.,"The stream of consciousness writing, loooonnngg descriptions, and inability for me to feel for the characters made this book a waste of my money. I can't believe I read the whole thing..."
4,very good condition,The book was in very good condition and it arrived promptly as promised. Would definitely do business with this seller again.
2,no instructions,"This item arrived with no instructions inside. I cannot figure out how to open it or install the filter or batteries. I called the company and they don't have any instructions to send me. I was told someone will call me with the instructions. Well, I bought this as a gift and I would like printed instuctions to pass on to the recipient. so far no one has called"
5,Best bucket,"I have had one of these buckets for a dozen or so years. Unfortunately, it met with an accident that destroyed it. I loved the bucket so much, I purchased two of them. They are just right for mops, soaking stained clothes, picking fruit, vegetables, carrying water, and many other jobs. It stores so easily in my kitchen cabinet."
5,perfect shape- hard to find,right size right shape for a small closet and right price could not find one in the local hardware stire
3,Pants that worked,These pants worked for me. Fit was true to size. The only downfall is that there is just a zipper no snap or button to close the pants.
2,Cord pants,"Pants were't too bad for the money but seemed to run small. Other pants I received the same day from another company fit fine, these ran a size small."
4,Have a Latin translation book nearby,"I am an avid reader and reenacter of Norman history in Italy. My interest in the Hauteville family is for the time beiing just starting to grow and I try to read all that I can on the family. What is my point? If you enjoy this type of material then you will enjoy the book. Plain and simple. Understand that with history that is 900 hundred years old, alot of information is just simply not available. The author must decide between what is factual and what was written for personal gain and deception. A very difficult task. My only problem with the book is that the author enters many Latin passages into the body of the work with no translation. This upset me but I bought a few books on Latin and I learned from it. So, did the author do this for a reason? The book is well written but if you have any knowledge on this subject the book will probably not open up any clouds in the sky. It just will fill in a few of the cracks."
4,Imbatible por el precio,"Aunque tuve algunas dificultades con la compra (el sistema vino sin los micrófonos headset y uno de los transmisores estaba dañado), después de los correspondientes reemplazos (rápidos y eficientes) quedé muy satisfecho con el producto. La calidad de sonido y el alcance son muy satisfactorios, sobre todo considerando el precio. Si busca un sistema que funcione y no afecte demasiado el bolsillo, éste es el indicado."
1,Horrible make up case,"As a professional makeup artist I thought all train cases are created equal! Boy was I wrong! This case looks great and price is good, but when it arrived it was very flimsy and poorly made the top of it was missing a piece of plastic so the inside was visible when closedDon't get this case...."
5,Great for first aid box,"I use mine as a first aid box for my house. Perfect for storing all kinds of little medical things that could get lost around the house. Now if someone gets sick or hurt, everyone knows where to go to get what they need. A must for every household."
3,Heavy duty?,"I wouldn't call these heavy duty. I do like the fact that they are small because they will be good for those smaller items that the normal sized forks barely hold. THey would be excellent for say... Cornish hens? The screws that hold the forks to the spit are ok but small and hard to hold. I don't know if they will hold up to that much abuse. Sometimes, I have had to use pliers to get the screws lose or tight enough on my other forks. I am not sure that these would handle that."
3,Only for really SMALL rotisseries...,"Just thought I'd let anyone considering these forks know that they will only fit a really narrow rotisserie rod (1/4""?). If you have a 1/2 inch diameter rod or larger (like I do), forget it. I had to return these and order heavy duty forks."
3,Somewhat dry reading,"This book has some interesting case studies, but it somewhat dry reading. I bought it for an MBA class, and it seems more suited to undergraduate study because there is not a lot of direct application for professionals."
4,Great bread box,"I was looking for a black bread box to match my kitchen appliances, and this was a great buy! I keep bread, tortillas, english muffins, etc. in it and they keep well! Only issue was shipping--the bread box was a little dented when it arrived, but I knocked out the dents"
5,"Awesome product - but not a true ""red"" color","The looks and functionality of this bread bin are 5-star - it is plenty roomy as well. The only thing to note - it is more of an orange/tomato-red color than a true, real red."
1,WORST CONDITION!,"This product came in a completely perfect box but once opened i realized the horrible quality. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The ""steel"" bread box was bent in several locations and wouldn't close properly. Spend more money and get something that wont get destroyed in transit to your house."
3,It's a bread box,"well its a bread box. it is not strong steal more like aluminum, and the door is not the smoothest. however it does the job and the black matches my black appliances and was not that expensive."
3,"Delicate, but less moldy bread","The first one arrived with a rivet popped out. The second one had a dent, but I just wanted the darn bread box, so I didn't send it back and we just popped the dent out as best as we could. It's very lightweight and looks nice. I leave the bread in loose or tied bags inside and they get stiff at about the same rate as sealing inside a plastic bag, but the bread does not mold nearly as fast and stays edible longer. It really holds in the heat and moisture though, which can change the mold factor if I'm not careful. I wish I could set it further away from the warm stuff in the kitchen."
1,I'm sorry I bought this book,I wish I had thumbed through this book before I bought it. It is very IE centric and a bit out of date. BTW FF has nearly a 30% market share.
4,Teach Yourself Esperanto,I took an Esperanto class at the Community College and this is the book the professor recommended. It is written so that you can go as fast or as slowly as you want.
2,All-In-Wonder NO TV,"I purchased this card with a new system. Had some difficulty installing the drivers from the CD, so I installed from the updated drivers on the ATI site. This went OK, but the TV cannot receive a signal, nothing but snow. I confirmed that my CATV feed is fine as a TV works perfectly with it. Nothing works with the card, not an external antenna, CATV or rabbit ears.I called tech support and spent a lot of time with them checking connections, the drivers etc.They told me the problem COULD BE with the motherboard, so their solution is to exchange the MB for a new one to see if the AIW card works with a new MB. Sure, I am supposed to rip apart the entire system cause their card doesn't do what it is supposed to.Everything else in the multimedia works fine.I have had several ATI AIW cards because I like their features, but getting them to work is a headache and ATI tech support is not the greatest."
4,actually pretty fun,its pretty cool you get to play as all the characters and use all their powers its sweet
4,Mixed Emotions,its grat at first then it gets really boringi will trade for splinter cell or for tony 4 or underground
3,Works OK,"Product works OK, but it can fall off the windshield, and it easn't easy to slide the pass out of the holder without removing the holder from the windshield. I do recommend it if you have the old-style Sunpass that doesn't come with built-in suction cups; its preferable to sticking it to the windshield with double-sided tape."
2,Waaaaay too big!,"Loved the actual material and looks of the turner, but it was waaaaaaaay too big and unwieldy. Gave it away to the first person who admired it at my yard sale! I wish the desription of the item had alerted me to its size and had pointed me to a smaller one."
5,Brilliant,Brilliant RPG of the dark future. There is nothing as exiting as making your cyberpunk charecter come to life in the nitty-gritty world of Night City anno 2020
2,Outdated - there are much better beginner's books.,"This book should have been updated long ago - it still talks of tuning with pitch pipes and pianos, and all the songs are old folk songs (""Nellie Gray"", ""Oh, Susanna"", ""My Bonnie ..."").Though aimed at absolute beginners, there are very few written instructions - you are expected to start playing your guitar just by looking at a few diagrams. Also, some basic music theory should have been included.There are much more comprehensive and well-written beginner's guides on the internet (and available for free, too)."
3,Baffled and Bewildered,"I wish we could choose a question mark in the rating system. I've just used the Sinucleanse neti pot, with mixed results. The right nostril went fine--although the whole setup seems a little awkward, I'm sure it gets better with practice. When I did the left nostril, though, I experienced growing head pain which culminated in a crushing localized headache which seemed to come in waves. I did use the neti pot until it was empty, and slowly felt better afterward. But the pain was frightening. If anyone can explain it, I wish they would! Afterward I sneezed several times, and now (ten minutes later) some ""gunk"" has come out."
4,Love,"This was my first net pot experience and I really liked it. However, I thought I was getting a glass one but it's plastic!"
4,Exactly as pictured,The item arrived just as pictured and contained some salt packets to get you started. The reason for only 4 stars is that the pot itself doesn't have a good marker on it for how much to fill it.
4,Helps a lot,"I got this because I have had a lot of sinus pressure recently. Although it looks really weird, and feels weirder using it, it definitely helped to alleviate irritating sinus pressure. It works well for me, but it doesn't get rid of all the pressure. I have noticed that it helps clear out my nose completely, and I breath much better now!As a side note... make sure the water you use is nice and clean. Get a filter or boil it if it is too harsh."
1,"Wait, wait and more wait...","Buyer Awareness: Pay close attention to the seller's estimated shipping time. I've waited nearly a month to receive this product (beyond the quoted ship time). At this rate, I'll get it after the major allergy season."
1,Still waiting to breathe better.,I would like to give this a glowing review but it still hasn't arrived yet. Do yourself a favor and get it at your local Walgreen's. Ridiculously slow shipping from this vendor.
4,"Very Effective, Feels Weird Though","The product was kind of expensive for a plastic jug IMO. However, it does work well once you get used to the weird feeling of putting water through your sinus passages."
3,For that cheap it's a nice investment,"For $13, this little thing is worth the money. I have been using it for over a month now and my sinuses are overall better but nothing miraculous. But for $13 it does work wonders!"
1,Nice product but could do without,"This should be a daily hygiene that should be done at least twice or three times a day, but seriously enough with this hype about the Neti-Pot products. You could easily do this with your own hands with no extra effort.This is the natural way to do it:Fill your hand with some warm water. Bring your hand just below your nose openings. Lean your head slowly backwards while breathing only from your mouth. Wash and repeat."
1,Has anyone ever gotten this cover?,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. Yeah, she's not getting it. I ordered it, paid for it, was told it was in stock, and waited for over a week for it to come in. After all that, including the waiting, I was informed it was not in stock. Understandable around the holidays, yes, but not understandable why it took so long to let me know. Got another order for a different cover which now won't be here before Christmas. Sure it would if I paid a fortune for shipping, but then getting it cheaper on this site would have it's purpose defeated. I could just go to the mall and get the same cover for $20. P.S. Who's rule is it you have to give everyone and everything at least one star? For what? The fact that they only made me wait a week before they told me. Thanks a lot!"
1,Horrible,"This is absolutely horrible. It's trash. What a waste of money, I suggest that you don't waste your money on this garbage."
5,This game rules!!!!,"This game is AWESOME!! In this game you get to face-off against about 96% of the characters in the show. The guys you don't get to duel against are Tea,Pegusus,Odion and Bandit Kieth. If you are a starting to become a duelist or even a ultimate duelist this is the game for you!"
3,Who would of thought a game could be this easy to beat?,"I got this game for Christmas and I immediatly started enjoying the game. I thought there wasn't anything better out there. When I saw review's and they said there was no plot, I didn't care. But when the opponents started playing not attacking when I had no monsters on the field, I knew this game was a fluke. The Graphics are supurb for a Game Boy color game but for all the Game Boy advances that are out, don't spend money on this. If you are willing to pay $30 for a Siearyu, Acid Trap hole and a other card, get the game now. Otherwise, Konami just made a dissapointment of a game here because it is too easy to beat!"
2,NOT REALISTIC!!!,"IT WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT THE GRAPHICS SUCK!! IF YOU CAN KEEP GOING AT SOMETHING FOR ALONG TIME THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! I GOT BORED WITH IT AFTER I EVEN GOT TO THE THIRD LEVEL. IT'S NOT LIKE THE REAL GAME AT ALL. YOU CAN KILL A BLUE EYES (EVEN A ULTAMITE)WITH A SHADOW MONSTER! EVEN IF IT HAS 100 ATTACK!! I DON'T PLAY IT OFTEN, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GAMES!! GET IT IF YOU DARE!!"
1,do not waste your money!!,"first thing that i hate about the game is that you have to gain level to get stronger cards.Second the grapic are outdated so the the card and picture are [disappointing] lookin.And the music is so bad that it make you lose interest. Do not get this game Insteadget yu gi oh the eternal duelist soul for Gameboy advance .IT worth you money ,the picture and the card are excellent!!. The music is much more better and you can never get tired of it. ANd If you dont have a gameboy advance get one because they stop making games for gameboy , so might as well get one.plus you can play your gameboy games on it too!"
4,Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Duel Stories,"This game is great. At first I questioned the game because it was difficult, but I quickly got the hang of it. When you start the game you are provided with a very bad deck of cards. It helps a lot if you have your own deck to enter into the game to play with. To enter a card chose password on the menu. Then type in the 8 numbers on the bottom left hand corner of the card(some cards can't be entered). Here is Blue-Eyes White Dragon's code 89631139. The graphics aren't very good but the game play makes up for it. If you enjoy the card game and/or the TV show this is a game you should buy."
1,SOME GAME,All ya do is play the card game forever.It gets boring after a while.I recommend playing the card game instead!BOO!
3,Not half as good as some of the newer games,"As much as I'm a fan of Yugioh, I'm sad to say that lately my oppinion of the game has gone down the toilet. Games like Nightmare troubadour are better.For one, the monsters have.. Element types?... Sure that makes it easier to win, but it's just... weird. You can't even play more than one trap card, only one can be in play at once, and if it's not used in one turn, it's gone. All the card effects are messed up, so if you play the card game, then consturct your deck in DDS the same way, It's almost Guarenteed to fail. Since when does the Harpie lady sisters say ""+2 power for own harpies dragon""?If your a huge fan of the series, then I would say buy it. Same to if your just starting out. But if your an experienced duelist and have a DS, I say go straight for Nightmare Troubadour, unless you want every game created."
1,Save your money,I am not homophobic but I had no idea this was about 2 lesbian women and their attraction to each other.I usually buy a number of books at a time. Out of my last purchase of approximately 6-8 books this was most disappointing.I did not read the book all the way through. But half was was too much for me.
4,Review for Basting Spoon,"This red Silicone Basting Spoon is a pretty and hefty. It serves the purpose well but if you are looking for a little lighter and smooth one,perhaps the stainless would be better."
5,Visionary. Stimulating. Required reading.,"An absolute gem. For anyone interested in consciousness a must. The ideas presented are exciting, challenging and will fundamentally alter how consciousness is discussed."
2,Sloppy editing,"Most ""investment advice"" books suffer from poor editing, both of the 'grammar & syntax' variety, and, more distressingly for this genre, flat-out incorrect information. Klines's book is no exception- the grammar & syntax are fine, but her book is replete with factual errors and misstatements. For example, on page 207, she defines a synthetic long futures as ""sell a call option, buy a put option."" Wrong. That is a synthetic short position. Similar errors pervade the book.One useful feature is chapter 3, which presents futures contract specifications. However, even here, some of the information is occasionally confusing or misleading.This book is published by McGraw-Hill, a highly reputable house. My surmise is that McGraw-Hill has no financial experts on its editorial staff; otherwise, it wouldn't tolerate the publication of such a sloppily-edited piece. Disappointing!"
1,Not good if you buy it for the DVD's,"I prefer to form my own opinion, but the other reviewers are on target. The films are excellent as you might expect from Murnau and Borzage. The DVD's arrive loose in the box looking like they've been sandpapered. I haven't watched them all the way through to ascertain whether they are usable or not, but I'm betting that at least one will not play all the way through. The books (that cause all the damage to the discs) are little more than a collection of still photos. I would not buy this set again and certainly cannot recommend it to anyone who takes care of their things. I expected 20th Century Fox to have produced a more professional product."
2,Item not as described,"I received these items today and was greatly disappointed. The reason I purchased them was the item description said they had screw on lids. THEY DO NOT! The lids simply sit on top of the canister. They do have a rubber seal, but the lids don't fit tightly enough to have the rubber seal make a difference. The size of the canisters is okay. Not that big, not that small. Why doesn't anyone make a huge storage container that looks nice?I'm greatly disappointed and will most likely be returning."
4,I like the looks of the canster set very nice,This is a very attractive canister set; I would recommend it however I have noticed the sugar gets a little hard after being in the can for a while. Over all it is very nice.
5,You too can be a Build Master,"This book is a great look into Software Configuration Management from someone who's been in the trenches. If you are new or experienced with SCM, this book will provide you with new information."
2,Decent Racing Game But Lacking in Many Areas,"This game has great graphics and a good selection of vehicles (even the Chevy Avalanche), however it lacks one component. . . fun.In career mode you would expect more feedback throughout the course of the season. All that you get is a flip from one season to another.By season four the tracks become redundant and you find that you are racing the same four tracks over and over again with difference weather conditions. I became so bored with the game after that I haven't picked it up since."
4,Excellent and Thorough,"Pronunciation Plus and Pronunciation Tasks are two excellent, thorough presentations of spoken English by the same author. The material is essentially the same, but Plus is American accent and Tasks is British accent."
2,i ve seen better,"...I am not impressed! it is nothing like the ps2's football game, but it will have to do..."
2,gadget enthusiast,I was disappointed with the spatula. It is too flexible and too large for my hand. My husband thought the size was okay but he too thought it was too flexible. It reminded me of a diving board!
1,piece of junk,"The basket doesn't fit together properly, if you did manage to attach it to the rotisserie rod, there is no way to add or remove food, and while I was fiddling with it I noticed that the clamp ring is plastic. Plastic. For a hot grill. This was perhaps the junkiest and most poorly designed product I have ever purchased on Amazon."
1,Worthless !,What a piece of junk ! Would you believe THERE IS NO DOOR TO PUT FOOD IN OR TAKE IT OUT. You have to dissasemble the whole spit to get anything out. The only chicken you could tumble is wings. Anything larger gets jammed between the spit and the basket. I used it one time and threw it out !
2,Old school gone bad.,"It feels like a long RPG made by RPG maker. Terrible graphics, music from 1991 and RPG maker style battle system with basicaly no story. Not worth it."
4,Nada mal... (not bad...),"Buen tratamiento del tema de Superficies de Riemann cerradas y abiertas. Nivel basico y entendible. Recomendable para una primera aproximancion al tema. Viene con ejercicios. Really good book, even for a first aproach to the topic of Riemann Surfaces. You just need basic background but you can also go further if you want. Good set of execises."
4,Works great,"I haven't run into any problems yet. Even with heavy use (backing up large amounts of data, or booting Windows (yuck) or Ubuntu), it stays cool. It's a little noisy, and it doesn't act as a hub, but if that's not what you're looking for, this is definitely a great choice. I recommend it to anyone."
2,breathtaking,"although jose is a very fine guitarplayer, I wouldn't recommend buying any of his work. I've never seen him play live but it sounds like he's playing with his nose. Every time you feel like it's gone away, it pops up again; his consistent nosebreathing. Maybe his face is to close to the strings.If this isn't enough reason not to buy this one; the titel song is a rap."
5,Excellent Church Resource,"This is a wonderful book to read about the multiculturalism concept in churches. It doesn't just talk about the reasons for advocating church diversity, it talks about why it doesn't happen in churches and the history behind it. The author gives excellent tools at the end of the book to help churches begin to explore racism and cultural diversity in their own facilities. Thumbs up! Dr. Anderson for the insight God has given you."
1,Want to save money?,"This book is incredibly expensive. I've seen it listed for $200+ at some stores. I bought a brand new, shrink-wrapped ""international version"" for $37 plus $30 shipping (TOTAL $67). I know you're thinking that the shipping was high, but I received the book 36 hours after I ordered it and was thankful! It came with 3 sealed CD's and the online access code. The international version appears to be exactly the same except it is a soft cover and has a orange colored border surrounding that same picture on the cover. Good luck."
2,Poor Organization and Boring,"My biggest problem with this book lies directly with the fact that teachers use it when you BEGIN learning the basics of anatomy and physiology. Instead of focusing on the basics, this book has a lot of unnecessary ""window-dressing"". Not only that, but the author could have shortened the explanations; why talk about a topic in 10 pages when it could easily be said in 3?By going on and on, this book only makes remembering the information more difficult. The book says ""Fundamentals"", but really it should be saying ""Everything-in-Between""! Not to mention the price is horrendous (though it has gotten much better). PLEASE college teachers, if you wish to help your students learn efficiently, use a book that doesn't turn the subject of anatomy and physiology into a bore-and-tedium fest."
2,Not the best text available,"I am an instructor in this course, and I really do not favor this textbook. It contains ALOT of information and data, and it is well organized with a ton of helpful diagrams and illustrations, but it is easy to drown in the text without absorbing it because the book does a poor job of explaining the concepts it covers. This text might serve help to a physiologist or physician, but for the individual who is studying to be in other fields of allied health, it is a ton of information that is not well presented. The text is very dense and not very reader friendly. The text does contain great illustrations...however, I believe Marieb's text is a much better book IMO."
3,laughable omission,How can this really be an Anatomy and Physiology textbook written by a Phd? There is not one picture or drawing of a male foreskin (prepuce). One does not have to wonder why the medical community is so ill prepared to deal with a normal male body.
5,An excellent follow up to Human Masquerade,"Cary Swinney is one of the best songwriters to come along in a very long time. Both of his CDs describe a very spiritual man fed up with modern day religions, but his music doesn't stop there. This album is also a call for personal freedom . All the songs on this CD will first make you smile, and then stop and think. Highly recommended, and, if you get the chance, go see him live. It will be a night you will not forget."
2,How to Murder a Millionaire? Start by Boring Them With This Book,"I truly tried to love this book. From the reviews and the personal recommendations it sounded like just the type of fun, witty, go-girl, fish out of water, can do, quirky mystery I could lose myself in.Instead all I wanted to do was lose the book.The characters, even our heroine, are mere shells of human beings who have had more horrible things happen to them the cast of most soap operas; yet, they have even less range of emotion, depth, or reflection than even the lowliest extra. I found the characters to be annoying, petty, and to act in a manner that defied both common sense and the weak environment that Martin painted for them. Lastly, the mystery often felt as though it was an afterthought to Grandma's cedar lined couture stuffed closets."
4,void writeRealisticCodingNovel(void);,"There aren't a whole lot of SF books that represent realistic views of what it means to be a programmer. This is one of them. For that reason it's recommended if you're a coder. It's also a fun story with some very interesting ideas.Cracker: ""I've seen your code.""Hacker: ""Yeah, but you didn't understand it."""
2,Did not receive the taper holders,"I love the double ring set, but I did not receive the taper holders like I was supposed to."
2,To small,The chain and medallion are way to small you can barely see the medallion when you have it on
5,Why didn't I find this sooner?,"I heard about Steve Maxwell through Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and knew he was a fitness guru but never really looked into his work. I have had bad hip, wrist, and knee pain for years from sports and decided to look into this DVD. Man am I glad I did!! I've gone to doctors and they took x-rays, and MRI's but only told me that I couldn't really do anything except take supplements for the pain. Which I did. Fish oil, glucosamine helped a little bit but not really. I pull patients at work all day and some days I sit in a chair all day. This does a number on my low back and over time I was just a stiff, painful mess. Doing these exercises I felt immediate benefit the first week. Some of the movements I feel pretty silly doing but it is well worth it for how you feel afterwards. You can't knock this until you try it, I 100% recommend this to everybody."
3,Need's a decent picture,"My 09 Ford Escape owners manual states I need an Motorcraft FA 1683 filter, so that is what I ordered. Unfortunately my 09 Ford Escape uses a round cylinder filter, and this one is flat. Must be a typo in the owners manual, but the look-up program also came up with this number. I never did find the actual Motorcraft filter model number that is appropriate for my 09 Escape, but this one is not it.If there was a decent picture I would have known that right off the bat."
1,Quality blades but not 250 blades,I'd like 225 more blades or my money back. This is the second time this happened to me on amazon.
5,Best show since Seinfeld,"How often do you witness something someone is doing and you feel that horrible embarrassment for them? You know, that chill that goes up the spine?? Yeah, that is what this show is all about. And it's brilliant. Each character is flawless and contributes to the office environment perfectly. For those of you who complain about it being racist or prejudice or sexist or blah blah blah and because of this is insulting, well, you don't get the humor. It's what makes the show so great. You get to appreciate it even more when you work in an office environment and can relate to some of the show's situations (though perhaps not as extreme as the show). I have yet to watch the BBC version and I have heard critisism from the British version's fans...understandable. The American version is based off of the British version because of how great it was. In any case, this is still one of the top sitcoms in the last decade. Keep up the great work Steve Carrell et al!"
5,The amazingness that is The Office,"Steve Corell is a comedic genius! Everything in this season continues with the momentum of the first. Though season three is the more consistently funny one, Season Two has its moments. The DVD is filled with amazing extras, and if you love the ensemble cast, than complete your Office collection and order this on DVD."
5,Must see show!,best show ever!! The cast is amazing and all are equally important! If you want to laugh then this is the show
5,Funny as ever,The laughs continue into this season and if you are a fan of the series then this is a must buy.
1,First experience with Amazon Unbox,"This was my first experience with Amazon Unbox, and I was very disappointed. The DRM of the video file made it impossible for me to convert it to a mobile-friendly format for use on my Android-based phone. Very disappointed, wasted money. I purchased the video, let me play it on the device of my choice!"
5,brilliant,"I knew I loved The Office before I bought Season Two, but I didn't realize just how much. I've watched every episode so many times, and I'm not even close to being sick of them. The commentaries are so brilliant and involve so many of the actors and writers and producers and others from the creative team of this show. I've learned so much about the show in general, as well as the specific writing decisions they've made, and the actors' choices and thoughts on how certain scenes turned out. The extras like the bloopers and the PSAs are so wonderful as well. This is one of the best purchases I've made in a while."
5,More than funny,this is a show that is so different on tv. When i first watched it I thought that it was ok but now I think that it is incredible. It ios so funny and the writing is very good also. The dramatic parts are amazing. Steve carell is so funny. I want to give it 1000000000000000000000000000 stars
3,False advertising,"This DVD does NOT come with all the ""extra stuff"" shown in the pictures on Amazon. It is false advertising. Why would they show things that you DO NOT get? I have no idea."
2,Orange-red not red-red like it appears,"This isn't as vibrant red as it appears in the picture. It's actually orangish red. I was pretty bummed about it because I had a gift card and could've used it on something else but at least I have a nice orange-red color now, I guess."
1,Its not what I expected,"This brand was recomended to me as being really high quality. My biggest complaint is that I can buy really chep polish that stays on longer then this. It doesnt just wear off or chip within a few days large peices just start to peel away. I tried top coats, base coats, stuff to make it adhere better and combinations of the 3 additonal items and nother helps. Cheap polish works great and i dont know why I decided I wanted to spend more money on a differant brand when simply put, cheap polish works, looks good and has more color varites. Im defanatly not purchaseing this again."
4,Great stuff,"Just saw Chris Cain live for the first time. He stood on stage in sun-glases and overalls looking every bit the old rural bluesman, and just proceeded to tear the roof off. Actually there was no roof, it was outdoors, but you get the picture. How a guy for San Jose (capital of Silicon Valley) could learn to play the blues like he was from another-town-another-era is beyind me. I guess I heard his playing as a more lyrical Stevie Ray Vaughn, or a more mercurial BB King. Either way, lovers of great guitar and great music will love his shows. The one I saw left the usually mild crowd howling for more. As for the album, it's very good, but it can't evoke the atmosphere of the live show itself. Very few albums ever do..."
4,Beautiful hippie psychedellic songs under the noise,"Beautiful hippie psychedellic songs under the noise. At first, the LP may sound like a noisey mess but listen closer... there are some beautiful songs there!! ""Unicorn"", ""Tears By The Pound"" and my favorite ""Angie Vampyre"" are amazing. This lp truly ROCKS! It also has a gospel feel.. Not in the sese of loving the ""Lord"" but the spirit and energy. There is a HIPPIE feel too that is mixed in with strong psychedellic sounds."
5,I read the Crystal Skulls,"I have read Jan Visser's short stories but this is the first novel of his I've read. This is a great story. It's a fantasy novel but with so much suspense, twists and descriptions of dramatic scenery and events, that many readers will enjoy it. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, you'll like this book!"
3,The Generals of Gettysburg,"I bought this book as a reference book. The profiles on each officer were well done and contained much information. However, there is no index in this book and only corp commanders are listed in the table of contents. Unless one knows the corp in which a particular officer served, it makes it very difficult to find any information. It is difficult to use as a reference. The book contains no footnotes, end notes, or a bibliography. The suggested readings at the end of each profile were helpful."
5,Great Clock,I just love this clock! It always gives an accurate time and temperature. You don't even have to set the clock. It receives an automatic signal and the time and everything is set for you. The outside temperature is also accurate even though I never put the sensor outside. It's amazing.
3,Nice atomic clock,"Easy to set up and read except in low light since it does not have a back-light, nor do the numbers ""glow in the dark"". I would describe this as a hybrid clock or that the designer could not decide whether to make a wall or desk-top clock; manufacturer describes it as a wall-clock although it is slightly small for a wall clock but rather large for a desk clock. It has an alarm clock and snooze button something I have not seen on a wall clock. I use mine as a stand up clock in a well-lit area; it comes with a sturdy attached closable stand. I am happy with my atomic clock/weather forecaster. Decent looking. Cannot comment on its temperature accuracy although its accuracy is good enough for me. Good value for the price."
3,Good piece of technology,"it has been about 3 years now. It still works fine. But the wireless thermometer is a bit of battery hog. I use 2000mah Ni-MH batteries and find myself having to recharge it every 3-4 months.Original review:After I ""read the instructions"", it was easy to setup. I used live on a slope with lots of radio black spots, so clock took a little bit of time to get the time and weather info. Since then it has worked fine. I was pleased to see the wireless thermometer work over 25 feet away across 3-4 walls. When mounted high readability gown down a bit."
4,Excellent time clock,"Took time to figure out on how to program the clock, but you can't beat a clock that sets itself via satellite and tells you the inside/outside temperature. I haven't figured out the forecast part. For $20, not a bad deal!!!"
3,Great Gadget,I really like this product. The only issue I have is that it tends to show warmer than what it really is outside
3,Just OK,"I've recently moved into a new home with much less counter space. I had a 20-bottle carousel that was just taking up too much space. I read the reviews about this and have to agree with the opinions about the bottle caps being low quality. I dropped a couple bottles unpackaging and one lid already shattered. I figured it was buyer beware, since I read the caps were flimsy and I'm clumsy. The rack itself can get front heavy and tip if you try to use anything other than the bottles included. I tried to just move the bottles from my old carousel to this new rack, but the caps were too large. Thankfully, all I had to do was change out all the caps and didn't have to transfer the actual spices. I am keeping it as I do like the overal design and it fits my space needs.I also purchased the Super SpiceStack 27 bottle organizer for the cupboard and it is wonderful!"
2,"Kill em all, let Margaret sort em out","I was not particularly impressed by ""The Last Thane"". On the whole, it was one of Doug's lesser works in my opinion. While he had some really good material in going into depth about life in Thorbardin, and the relations between dwarven clans, it seemed to me like he was just trying to see how many dwarves he could kill off at once, so no one would wonder where they were when the Fifth Age writing started."
4,High quality but too flexy,"I bought this to turn hot food in large pans, and it works very well for that. Since it's made of silicone it won't melt unless you accidentally toss it in the oven or something.Like the other reviewers, I also found the neck to be a little bit too flexible for my tastes, though. When I use it for incidental things (like stir-frying) I never quite know when it's going to spring and bend.I do like that it's a nice, large turner (bigger than I expected from the picture, and thicker than my other turners). It's defintitely not going to work for small things, like turning omlettes in a little omlette pan, but other than that it's great.Oh, and one other thing: if you notice an unpleasant odor when you get it, just give it a few washes to get rid of it. Most products made of silicone have this problem out of the box."
4,Another great release by RockStar,Max Payne and Grand Theft Auto 3 in my opinion were the best games of the year and both were relased by Rockstar. Max Payne has a chilling storyline and terrific graphics and gameplay. My only complaint was I really didn't like the controls on the game. I like games where you only have to use one analog stick instead of two but thats just me. That is why I gave Max Payne a 4 rather than a 5. Other than that this is a great game and you should atleast rent it to see how you like it. The storyline and the awesome moves that Max can make in the game make up for the controlling.
2,Max Pain!,"Do not waste your time buying this awful tedious game! It's a Tombraider wannabe except Max can't climb, can't swim, can't drive a car, can't ride a bike, can barely jump. A lot of can'ts! All he pretty much does is shoot and shoot and shoot! To brake the monotony, the creators of this game torture you with a blood maze in the dark. Trust me you don't wanna know! What really stinks about this game for playstation2 is you can't save your progress, rather the game has save points done automatically for you. It's bad enough you have to play through it's pathetic chapters with neverending storytelling but you must endure repeating it over and over again until you complete the level. Unless you are in prison or have no life DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! In one word ""PAIN""."
3,Average shooter,This game takes place in New York where you play as Max Payne. The game starts when Max comes home to discover that his wife and child have been murdered. From there you basically go from place to place shooting up bad guys in a third-person view. The controls are a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it they're not so bad. A cool feature is something called bullet-time where you can slow down time like in The Matrix and shoot up the place. The graphics are pretty impresive with loads of detail on little things such as individual bullets. The game is fun if you need an action fix but it kind of gets old after a while. It's still a good game but if you want a good action game then get GTA3.
2,What a disappointment!,"I recently purchased ""Max Payne"" and was expecting much more than what I really received from the game. Don't be fooled into thinking that the graphics are high-quality by looking at the back of the case or seeing the commercial, because they are in fact slightly poor and less than satisfactory for a game designated to the PS2 console. The storyline is intelligent, and that is probably it's best attribute. The characters are somewhat blocky and you have only a little white dot used to aim at the enemies, which, at specific points in the game, becomes extremely frustrating. The characters in the movie portions of the game are not well assembled and this makes them look like their limbs are broken or something to that effect. I highly recommend that you do not purchase this title. If you want a game by Rockstar, get Grand Theft. Max Payne [stinks]."
1,Not Gonna Cut It,"with games such as Grand theft auto: San Andreas, driv3r,true crime, etc. the competition is fierce and a game like this won't cut it. first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for $6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner. i saw it at EB games for only $5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a ""greatest hit"" play GTA or true crime instead"
3,Not that good.,"The best Pink Panther film is The Return of the Pink Panther, which isn't included in MGM sets because it's owned by Universal.[...]It's only [...] here on Amazon and it is, by far, the best in the series.These Pink Panther films (except the first one, which was intended as a vehicle for David Niven until the producers realized that it was much more entertaining to watch Sellers) are OK, and funny simply because of Sellers. But it's not worth this kind of price when you can get his best Clouseau in The Return of the Pink Panther/"
4,Fun for kids and big kids,"You have to laugh at the weirdness in this book and don't take it seriously. Unfortunately, there are too many reviewers on here and other sites who DO take themselves too seriously. This book is silly and improbable but so what. You smile reading it."
4,Readers Beware,"First, this is an excellent series and I love the chemistry between the actresses. However, readers be warned that this is not exactly the Rizzoli & Isles in the books and liberties are taken. That said, it's an interesting show and Angie Harmon is a joy to look at and I do like how they played up the quirky side of Maura Isles. Honestly, it's worth reading the books as well as watching the show. Having read the books I did not feel that the show wasn't worth my time.Looking forward to the next season on dvd."
5,My wife really enjoyed it!,My wife spent an entire weekend and finally got caught up with this series. She never gets to watch it at home.
2,Major Disappointment,"I have read all the Tess Gerritson books and I was hoping so much for this television adaptation. It is not available in the UK and I bought the DVD expecting so much and it was so disappointing. I accept that there has to be a degree of artistic license, but this doesn't come close to what I was hoping for. There is very little connection to the books. Jane married Gabriel and Maura was having a ""relationship"" with Father Brophy. What happened to this? I definitely won't be buying Series 2 when it is available. Angie Harmon is a great actress, but she doesn't come close to what I thought was Jane."
2,Disappointed,"Ia m a fan of Tess Gerritsen and i have read all of her books; this TV series is a real let down, I don't know how it can possibly make it to another season. If another season comes I will not watch it."
4,Pretty cutting edge... for the time.,"Ok.. i'll keep it to the point. Electronic drums, crappy synths, and the typical early 90's singer. What the band does have is creativitiy, or something. And for the drawing of Hitler dressed up as a girl on the cover; a+. Spirit Of Suicide is one of the better tracks on here."
4,FINALLY AN UPDATE!,i have always been a big fan of Ned's Atomic Dustbin i luv the loud bass and their grooves this dvd basically updates you on the current state of the band im a fan so it was worth it to me. I would have liked a better production on it but then again in the end im still a fan and appreciate anything newer on a band that refuses to go away and is still good for the right reasons!!!!LONG LIVE NEDS ATOMIC DUSTBIN!!!!!!!!
4,Easy Sprit Women's Walking Shoe,"My mom is 85 years and its very difficult to find shoes that fit and are comfortable. She is fairly active and wants to look presentable in her day to day activities. This casual shoe is appealing to the eye and is well made and durable. The leather never fades nor ""chips"" off."
5,Excellent,"Easy Spirit Women's AP1 Sport Sneaker,White Leather,9 M Thanks, the shoes are nice and the service was great. Amazion is the place to shop."
5,Love Easy Spirit shoes!,"These shoes are so comfortable. They never need a ""break in"" period. I have several pairs and they wear beautifully! Even pairs that I purchased years ago look great!"
4,"Fine for new surfer, new longboarder.","I am new to surfing and to longboarding. This presented me with terms, basics, and plenty of which I needed and wanted to know to go try out my board. I can see where some who have other experience may not be completely forfilled with this. I am pleased with it."
3,OK... But,This book was really only of moderate usefullness. I got better information at my local surf shop.
4,Well done Mini-series,Great cast and very thoughtful. I think it is one of the better movies done about the Holocaust. Very underated.
5,Holocaust,Have been waiting for this DVD for a very long time. It is the best mini series ever made in my opinion. This personal account of the holocaust was very well presented and the actors were all excellent and very convincing in their roles....Holocaust
2,Hollywood Movie,"As usual, this is a Hollywood treatment of the Holocaust. Well know actors, some speaking with British accents and some in American English. Some Nazis (actors) make an attempt to use a German accent with English. The plot is well know, the Holocaust is well documented. But using Hollywood stars to depict the Holocaust is a big mistake. The film lacks authenticity. I would have preferred subtitles. The direction is sloppy, and again lacks conviction. This film has several DVD's and I am struggling into the third disk. I doubt I'll reach the end.I give it two stars because Hollywood is lousy at making authentic films about the Holocaust."
5,Why is this not available on DVD in the US??,This is one of the all time great miniseries events .. Why is this not on DVD yet in the US?
4,Holocaust,"We were extremely pleased to see this product offered by Amazon.com, so we pre-ordered it. When it was ready to ship, Amazon, true to their word if there is a price reduction, billed us $10.00 less than the pre-order price.Keeping in mind that this was a made-for-TV series, hence there were plenty of commercial breaks, and these showed up as very short blank spots in the video transfer to DVD; however,this powerful performance by a superb cast of actors, should serve as a strong reminder of what a fanatic did to the Jewish people in World War II, so that we may exercise our power to never let it happen again.My spouse and I, in spite of the video shortcoming, would recommend this DVD to anyone."
2,Poor representation of a horrific event,"This movie tells a truly terrible story but watching it doesn't impart the severity of it. The people appeared to be clean shaven, wore clean clothes and never looked like they had missed a meal. The depiction of the barracks in the camps appeared to be clean and spacious. It didn't leave the feeling that this was a truly terrible place to be, more of a summer camp type environment. Perhaps it was the best production that they could do 30 years ago but there are more realistic historicals available today that give a more accurate idea of what the life was really like. (Uprising By Leelee Sobieski and others). If you are going to tell the story, it should be in a way that makes every listener realize the terrible nature of what happened. This movie was pleasant to watch and it should not be, it seem to be suger coated to me."
2,"POOR VIDEO QUALITY, but GREAT ACTORS and story","If you have an old VHS copy, don't waste any time purchasing these DVDs. These look as if they were copied from slightly edited VHS tapes, even the analog sound from the orginal VHS stereo is adequate but it isn't the HIFI standard. The audio has been touched up with some noise reduction, why a MAJOR production house could screw up such a classic presentatin is beyond me. Save some money and buy a VHS copy instead of these poorly produced DVDs."
2,Disappointed,"I appreciate Mr.Logsdon's writing abililty. In fact, I was enjoying the book immensely until I got to the part about killing the raccoon, which happens to be the animal I wanted to learn to get along with. I think the title is very misleading. I wanted to know how to get along with my backyard neighbors, and not by killing them. To top it all, he actually gave recipes for raccoon dishes. Like I said, it was quite enjoyable until this part, but I feel there are much more pleasant ways to get along with our backyard neighbors. I don't offend easily, but this title does not fit the entire contents of the book."
2,Mmmmm... Richard?,"He has a good selection of songs and got his own style. I loved his former CDs so far. But this new one, I listend it at the store before I went to the casher..., and I did not buy it. The mix is kinda annoying, too fragmented and very same technic he has been using... Maybe I can say that I got bored with it and wanna see something new from him. I still like Richard humpty Vision a lot, so I really hope he's gonna produce better one."
2,"Measures Temperature, Condensation inside Glass.","Used it once. After cleaning, inside the glass has condensation on it. I wonder how long it wall last. I have found that once this happens, the thermometers usually fail."
2,Must have gotten a defective one.,"Purchased this to use in gas grill to check temp of grill. The meat thermometer worked fine, but the small, oven-temp thermometer didn't work."
1,Defective Product,"I purchased this thermometer in late September but first used it on Thanksgiving; the bottom half, which is supposed to read the oven temp, doesn't work. Just as Mr. Marcus, an earlier reviewer indicated. I am currently attempting to reach Amazon to discuss how to proceed, as I am out of the return window for this item."
1,Total waste of money,Two days old and the lens cracks in half after washing with hot water and Dawn. Doesn't anyone know how to make a decent thermometer?
4,Works for me!,"With an oven temp I can never be certain of, this little beauty allows me to stay on top of the heat in the hot box. I don't understand the problems some other reviewers had. Haven't used it in the Weber as yet, but I surely plan to."
1,Received bucket without ringer,Received the Bucket without the ringer. Amazon can not replace missing parts-offered refund if bucket sent back-not worth the trouble. The bucket part of the order does appear to be a good size for a small apartment.
1,Rubbermaid bucket,I was very upset with this purchase. I thought it was blue in color as depicted in the picture and there was no mention anywhere of different colors. Instead an UGLY gray bucket came with no shipping return label to send it back. The only good thing is it did not cost me that much but I would hesitate to buy from them again. It is not worth the cost to me now to try and send it back.
4,"Fantastic tips, but not a definitive book","I picked up this book several months ago, and I keep coming back to it. I have been using Dreamweaver for six years, and I still picked up lots of great tips in this book. It's great as a tip resource, and one that you will keep coming back to, and I highly recommend it for its content. My two complaints about it are related to each other: The titles of the tips and the organization within the chapters.In this book, there are tips called ""Alias: The Dreamweaver Command"" (for Clean Up HTML/XHTML), which don't really tell you what the tip is for. More concise tip titles describing the tip would be a lot easier to find what you are looking for. I would also like to see groups within the chapters. That also doesn't exist in this book.That said, I highly recommend the book. Though it's not perfect, it's great!"
3,Scott Kelby Is Funny. These Guys Are Just Annoying.,"Do you have one of those uncles who thinks he's so-o-o-o-o funny, even when he's not? The kind of uncle who has to make a pun or other kind of word play every time he opens his mouth? Maybe you know the type. That's the feeling I got from this book...an unfunny, pathetic guy sitting around trying way too hard to be funny, and falling flat on his face 99% of the time. OK, so there are some good tips in here, but if writers Lowery and Buraglia had expended more time and energy clarifying their tips and a lot less time trying to be funny, this book probably would have been a great help. What makes anyone think that writing a ""killer tips"" book will make them as funny as Scott Kelby? When will some of these people stop trying to be comedians and start writing usable stuff? When will I learn to stop buying this stuff???"
2,"Unique Information, Much Propaganda.","There is about 50 pages of good information in this book buried in 300 pages of complaints about the US attitude towards the Cuban Revolution.The book details the Russian missles and nuclear war heads installed in Cuba when the US discovered the missles. Apparently US intelligence did not know that they were there and did not detect the war heads when they were being removed.The book points out that we were much closer to disaster than we knew.The book does reaffirm the opinion in ""The House of War"" that the Soviets did not want the situation to get out of control."
3,Only OK,"I find this to be a perfectly functional spatula. It does what I would expect a silicone spatula to do, which is stir things and scrape goo out of bowls. However, I have two beefs with it.One is the fancy handle. Most of the weight is in the handle so if the spatula is resting on the cusp of the handle it tilts out of the bowl catapulting the bowl's contents with it. Also I found the claim that ""the KitchenAid logo even doubles as a spatula rest"" is a bit unfounded. In a fairly large pot I can just manage to get the spatula to rest on the logo. Otherwise the whole thing just slides right in the pot. I've been much happier with the 'just a stick' variety of handle.Two is just a personal preference, but I find the silicone to be a bit stiff. The end is a bit thick and doesn't flex quite enough to be as effective as it could be. All in all it's a usable spatula, but I wish I had not spent the extra money and gone with the no frills variety."
4,David Wilcox Vista,"Think of James Taylor, Cat Stevens, and add a little Tracey Chapman and Mary Chapin Carpenter and you get the idea of how pure this man's voice and lyrics are. Vista continues on the long line of wonderful music that David Wilcox has graced us with. The title song Vista allows you the feeling of the wide openness of life and love and its endless possibilities. I highly recommend this cd and if you haven't already, get all of David Wilcox's music."
2,It okay,"David is pretty mellow on this CD. I like the more upbeat, fun stuff he did some years back."
4,Good budget minded custom earplugs,"I have made and used these plugs for several months. It takes time to get use to sleeping with them in. I'm planning on buying more of the kits so I can make a few sets to leave in my boat, chainsaw box and truck. For the price, this is the least expensive method of getting truely custom fit plugs."
1,Buyer Beware,"Ordered the Radians Custom Molded Earplugs from Outdoorbunker. Recieved the item in a timely manner. However, if you want a particular color, don't count on it. I ordered orange and recieved tan. Don't know if the seller is colorblind or can't read. Thankfully they are inexpensive and I can get what I want from someone else."
5,Good Product,I was able to form my ear plugs without any issues. Easy to mix and sets very quickly. I use them under my helmet for quieter motorcycle rides.
4,Viva Valdes,Irrespective of your period of existence Bebo Valdes will make you want to move. I do not speak the language but I love the rythms and I highly recommend this CD.
5,Husband Read From Cover to Cover,My husband is recovering from a recent major heart attack. He couldn't put this book down. It is very inspirational and informational for anyone faced with such a life alternating traumatic episode. Excellent for family members to read as well.
5,Another great read,"Another engrossing read from Kellerman, keeps you guessing until the end. Great story line, Alex and Milo's friendship is always entertaining!"
2,Silly Premise,"This is one of Kellerman's poorest books. When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous. Don't waste your time on this."
3,Okay.....,"I simply love the Alex Delaware series. I've read every book up to this one and especially enjoyed Time Bomb and Silent Partners. For me, Private Eyes, just couldn't compete with the prior installments of this series. It was a no-brainer who the villian was and there was only one minor plot twist. While I eagerly devoured the novel it was because I kept waiting for the plot to pick up or for the twist to happen. It was simply an okay read instead of great like the previous books."
5,where's the DVD?,"What's with the Instant Video - NOT going to put my money into this at all. Love the show and will purchase the DVD if, when it's released."
5,Fabulously Funny,"In ""Ding Dong Ditch,"" Last Man Standing roars back from a few slower episodes. This was more funny than any recent episode, and it brought back the joyous laughter of the first few episodes. My wife and I laughed our way through this one, and here's hoping the show keeps up this strong showing."
1,Do Not Buy,"This is Not a Bob the Builder program. It is going toconstruction sites and no storyline with Bob with Wendy, Spud and all the machines (no storyline at all). Not even a real Bob episode!!!!!!!Wish I did not have to give it 1 star."
5,surprising,"Imbrium had lost her edge to scare. This might not seem so bad to us, but Imbri was a night mare, a bringer of bad dreams. It seemed that after acquiring half of a soul, her will to frighten had been shoved out. Also, her secret desire to see a rainbow didn't help much either. So her sire, the Night Stallion, retired her from dream duty for two reasons: her edge was lacking, and he had a mission for her. That mission was to save Xanth."
3,Good music,I like it. It good for Christmas for Roman Nikolas. good music. I like it like Rockin Santa. I am waiting for the Wiggles Go Bananas!-age 5
5,michelle deco diamond gold watch from Watchmaxx,The Michelle deco watch I ordered from Watch maxx came beautifully boxed and they were able to get it for me in time for my daughter's 30th birthday. the service was excellent.
2,Don't waste your money,"Sometimes you get what you pay for and this is no exception. Don't waste your money on this set, just spend a little more and get a set of Logitech speakers with a subwoofer. You won't be disappointed."
3,good for the extra computer,"I bought these speakers for an extra computer I set up for classes (colage student). They sound a lot better than the 2 peice set I had. the Bass is weak and breaks up if you turn these up, but this set has really good highs. I replaced the kicker with an old stereo speaker form a dead bookshelf stereo system. Overall, these are better than a 2 peice setup but don't expect to be jamming out with these speakers though, they are ok for games but the explosions make them break up a little, bottom line if you need speakers cheap, these are cheap speakers. For better speakers at around the same price get the Cyber Acustic CA-3080, asim #B00005BC0J"
1,terrible,"This product your not even getting what you paid for... I ordered mine and got them earlier then the expected shipping date which i was happy about. But as soon as i got them i set them up and plugged them in and started playing them.. The sound from the two speakers are very clear i will give it that, But the subwoofer is absolutely terrible! Distorted beyond belief i tried playing with the EQ on my ipod/phone/computer and turned the bass all the way down and it still could not handle it.... The speakers in my labtop are better speakers then these absolutely do not but these.. Go with logitech, a little bit more expensive not much tho but the quality difference is incredible!"
3,Cyber Acoustics,This is an adequate set for sound. It does not have the power or quality for serious listeners. I bought this to replace a pair of Bose Companion and was pretty disappointed with the sound but OK with the price. To sum it up you get what you pay for in any speaker system.
2,It broke,"As a cheap upgrade, I bought these speakers for my laptop. On a positive note, they looked nice and had decent sound quality considering the cost. For $20, they seemed like a fine investment and I was a happy camper for several months. That is, until they broke. The blue light was the first to break, which wasn't a big deal. But shortly after, the entire unit was dead silent and completely useless no matter how loud I cranked the volume."
4,"Small Price, Big Sound","For the price, these can't be beat. Obviously, they are not a top-end system. However, for less than a tank of gas, you'll have a computer speaker system that will last for years."
1,Don't Bother - Poor Quality,Not worth the time or money - Poor Quality - Even Worse Sound - lots of crackels and pops - inside interference!
3,"woofer suck big time,but...","For the price its just unbeatable. Speakers are fine,soft balanced sound(for the price) ,but woofer...woof!!! There si no woofer ,just 3"" speaker set to 5 khz. It can't even pump the air even a litlle bit from the box.Even 10 y.o. kids didn't like it. So I found 8ohm, 10 watt 3"" incher online for $5, he screwed it in instead of original, and kids are happy now;)"
1,Crap,"I'm a School of Rock guitar teacher. I picked these up today at walmart to stick in my practice room for hookup to my laptop. they should like s***, used them for all of thirty seconds and decided to unplug and use laptop speakers. seriously the worst speakers I've ever heard"
1,The Worst Ever - Get some headphones,"Headphones have better quality than these, unfortunately the $$$ price tag lured me in. I may be spoiled becuase I have a nice speaker system at home, but when I bought these for the office, I was extremely dissapointed. Here's why...The subwoofer distorts, even at VERY low volume and there is a buzz inside the enclosure too.The tweeters are very tinny sounding and the volume is not balanced between the sub and the tweeters.You really get what you pay for with these speakers..."
5,BIG sound,"With a ""woofer"" the size of a quarter, what could i expect? Well, the magic is clearly in the size of the box around that woofer. I have gone through multiple pairs of speakers searching for a powerful, clear, deep bass sound for my computer. These blew me away, and definitely taught me that a 2.0 system (besides studio monitors) will never match the bass of 2.1. Get this, don't be a fool and buy a $100 system. The people talking about static or crappy noise? Not in my set."
2,Not the best,I didn't find this book as helpful as I had wished. The chapters only touch the tip of the iceberg and don't necessarily go into detail on how to implement the techniques.The book could have been much more cohesive and comprehensive.
2,Soup pretty good but packaging sucked,"While I enjoyed the soup itself, I must join the other reviewers who complained about DENTED CANS. Yes, 9 out of the 12 cans in my last shipment were slightly to moderately DENTED. Ugh! Is Amy's unloading its dented cans on unwitting Amazon customers? Anyway, folks, this item is not eligible for return but a very accommodating customer service agent just gave me a refund. I will not buy this item from Amazon again, due to this DENTED CAN issue. I will pay a little more and get it from one of the other online health food stores that will ship me an undented can."
4,One of the best Amy's Soups,"I don't remember what I paid for this in the grocery store (I didn't buy it on Amazon, I'm just reviewing the soup itself) but it was more expensive than most soups. I got it at Big Y and it was almost 4 dollars, which is REALLY pricey for soup, organic or not. Other than the price, I really liked this soup. Amy's has always been very hit or miss for me and most of their soups are really bland and need added ingredients. SInce soup is supposed to be easy I'd just rather a soup I can simply heat up without having to worry about adding anything other then maybe some salt and pepper...this soup worked for that. I found it to be more flavorful then other Amy's soups and it was also really filling."
3,"A brief, conventional history of Big Bend National Park","Roderick Nash called for a history of each of our national parks. That provides the justification for Jameson's brief book, which neatly checks this important but underappreciated park off the Nash list.Jameson hits the issues you want in a park history, from park creation to contemporary management. He doesn't manage to come up with a compelling overall narrative, nor does he place this park in a wider temporal, intellectual, or political context. If you're interested in Big Bend NP, and especially if you're visiting and want some background, this book will serve you well."
5,Easy as pie... I promise!,"I recently recieved the cradle as a gift. I'm seven months pregnant and I was able to put it together by myself without any help. For anyone that had questions about the washers included in the package, you put the washer on the screw before tightening. It prevents the screw from damaging the wood. There should be exactly ten washers, and ten screws. Hope this helps anyone who was confused!!"
5,Very nice piece of furniture,"I just assembled this myself, at 8 months pregnant with no help. It took me about 15 minutes. It looks great, and is bigger than I expected it to be. I can't wait to put my little guy in it!"
3,An American in Paris on Blu-ray,"An American in Paris [Blu-ray]I love this movie, but frankly, I don't think the picture quality and sound are really that much better than the DVD. So don't waste your money."
3,You really have to like dance,I like old movies and the story line in this one is good. They just can't get beyond the dance in this one.
5,Singing In the Rain,This is an all time great musical. I watched it with my grand daughter and two great grand daughters and they loved all the singing and dancing. Also the quality of the movie was excellent
3,Not the best Gene Kelly Film,I don't think this Oscar winning picture holds up very well. To me it seems slow and a little dull. It has none of the humor of SINGING IN THE RAIN or the style of THE PIRATE. If you are new to the work of Gene Kelly start with those two. AN AMERICAN IN PARIS can wait.
2,an embarassment to the musical genre!,"I felt sick after watching this movie. I thought it would be like Singing in the Rain, which is one of my favorite musicals. Instead, I get cheesy acting, overproduction, a sub-average dialogue, and the worst plot for any musical I've ever seen. The music was commendable, which is why I give it two stars. But the dance numbers and the movie in general are so overproduced, it's practically megalomaniacal. As stated above, the acting and dialogue are boring. And not only is the story beyond cliche, but in the end the guy gets the girl for no reason we can think of, in the most vile Hollywood ending ever. Stick with The Music Man instead. Or Singing in the Rain. Or Showboat. Just not this . . ."
2,Pardon MGM's French,"Thanks to its lengthy ballet finale, visual homage to French painters and Gershwin score, some people (or at least Oscar voters) apparently mistook this for some kind of high art in the early Fifties. Today, it is simply hoity-toity snob torture of the worst kind and damn near unwatchable. Kind of telling that whenever the movie is excerpted in tributes today, the only scene you ever see is a few minutes of that endless dance sequence at the end. Begs the question: If this movie is so great, how come they can never find any other compelling clip?"
5,Great Purchase,Great purchase. Product was exactly as described and works perfectly. Superior quality and durability. I would purchase this product again.
2,No Way Out/Company Busines,"The DVD came to me on time and in good condition. Always seem to have a good business experience when dealing with a purchase from Amazon, and this time was no different.The viewing of the DVD wasn't what I expected. There were scenes and language,I felt were not good for anybody, which would have been better left out. I don't recommend these movies, but I do recommend doing business with Amazon.com"
1,Awful Mat,"We bought this mat to replace an old Rubbermaid mat we had for along time. This mat was terrible. After using it for awhile we threw it away!! It didn't want to stay flat. The ""suction cups"" were too big. The material was weird and when the water hit it, it was loud. Nothing good about it."
1,I wish I did not buy it,"If I could I would have returned it, but I did not bother because I only paid $10. It is a huge brooch. The picture is misleading. If you like big brooches, then go for it"
5,Inherited by my mom!,I have really rebel wavy hair and my mom got this as a gift 10 yrs ago. We both used it. She gave it to me abt 4/5 yrs and honestly it sooo good. It leaves ur hair sleek and shiny (depending how good you take care of your hair). Anyway just recently it makes this weird sound and it smells kindda bad haha but i cant complain. I just need a new one after 10 yrs.
3,Nothing different than a regular blow dryer,"I was trying to find a better blow dryer than the regular you get in the store ($20), but this one does not have so much different and also is really really hot."
5,Way too popular an item,Ok now I have bought 3 of these things. The first I bought at a store and my Mom has yet to return it. The other didn't make it home from a party. For heat resist to 500 F it is amazingly flexible. Bowl lickers will hate it as it will get it all. Blueberries and raspberries haven't stained it. Better than a regular scraper as it 'spoons' out batter perfectly for cupcakes and toppings for cherry cheesecakes.
4,Interesting Look at Military School,"I actually read this book twice. Enjoyed the descriptions of Charleston, my favorite city. Did not agree with the central character's negative opinions of ""The Institute"" or military schools in general. Think the author was perhaps expressing his own bias in a ""novel"". I had trouble with the language of the characters and the way they talked to each other.....until I thought about it. Probably the book is pretty accurate about young men at that time and in that place."
5,A passionate story of brotherhood and betrayal,"The story of four young men (Will McLean, Dante Pignetti (Pig), Mark Santoro, and Tradd St. Croix. These four men entered the Institute (Caroline Military Institute) alone. They forged the best of friendships only to be ripped apart by one traitor. A must read."
5,You won't put it down,"With heart-wrenching reality, this book opens eyes to military life and all of it's faults. Twists and turns, romance, intrigue, and corruption,"
4,Bonecrack by Dick Francis,"Dick Francis is a formula writer of the highest callibre. His heros are believable and always slightly flawed. The love interest is never over done. The plot is always gripping because the characters are full bodied, the background well painted and real. What happens in this environment takes on the quality of a biography, not fiction. That his books usually involve horses and horse racing matters very little in terms of the overview. It is the pallet he uses, not the ensuing portrait. The bad guys usually gain the upper hand about two thirds of the way through the book and the hero always comes out on top. How he is able to do this is never because of any super human quality, but because of perseverance. Like his other books, this is a book about the triumph of an everyday guy over adversity. The hero is somebody you know or would like to know. His adventures are things that could happen to you in another life. This is wonderful reading. Worth saving for a rainy day."
3,Too small,"All I can state for now is that the book is INCREDIBLY rough on my eyes. The pages are extremely thin (showing text from the other side of the page) and the text is very very small. If I could get this in a readable font size on quality paper, I would be ecstatic.I have a feeling I will end up selling this. I simply cannot stare at it for more than 30 seconds without my eyes crossing. What a shame."
5,A wonderfully written book.,It's about he Steed family as they move New york to Ohio and then to Missouri. I really loved this book I recommend it to all.
1,JUNK,Doesn't work. Save your money and the paint on your appliances. Do not buy this piece of junk. Very disappointed.
2,"What? Canaan, not Catan? Grrrrr.","Well, like the other reviewer, I thought this was The Settlers of Catan, not the Settlers of Canaan. Sigh. That really annoys the tar out of me. I might try giving it away to my sister, who is a youth pastor, or I'll return it otherwise.I find it somewhat dishonest to have something named so similarly, but that's probably because I fell for it. The original game is a classic, and I have no interest in a ""re-imagined"" version."
1,a book about color with few pictures!,"I had high hopes for this book because the cover was so beautiful but I had a really difficult time getting through the concepts because there are almost no pictures! Color is something you need to see to get and after struggling through a couple chapters, I just threw it away. I would suggest the author add pictures on every single page to illustrate their points, until then, stay away."
3,"Needs ""Doctoring"" to make a decent tasting soup","The soup is not too great and tastes blend. I improved it to acceptable taste by adding a veggie mix, a teaspoon of ""Organic"" vegetable soup powder... then it was not so bad. But than, if one goes that far in improving the soup... why bother with the canned soup and not just make it from scratch."
5,Perfect for us,"This table is great!!! Smaller than the little tikes(too big!!)but not too small. Love that it has the cover so we can keep it outside. Great for sensory activities, water, play-doh, coffee beans, whatever. If you don't have a lot of space(SoCal yards are small) this is it !!!"
4,Grrrreat Little Flashlight,My son loves this flashlight! He got it for his 2nd birthday and it's fun and very easy for him to operate. I like that it has an auto shut off and the noise that it makes is not annoying like some similar flashlights. It did seem that the batteries that came in it didn't last very long but we just replaced them.
5,"Easy, stable, and fast","Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection."
4,Great Buffalo Chips at a Great Price,"This WiFi 54g card performs like dynamite. Installation is quick & easy with no glitches. Almost zero setup required and little to no technical knowledge is needed. If you know how to install a PCI card, you're in.My previous (and inoperable) WiFi card was from AT&T.; Setup was too clunky, performance stunk with frequent drops, and a non-intuitive driver app.The one take-away is that the Buffalo install guide is poorly written, apparently in China. The steps are incorrect, and the screen shots do not match what actually happens. No matter, because you could install this without even looking at the guide. Just install the card, boot & drop in the CD."
1,A convoluted and truly stupid book,"This book was a waste of time and money. The characters were wooden and one dimensional---I couldn't even sympathize with the heroine, Lauren--no matter what she went through. The supporting characters were not well developed at all, and the ending was predictable and flat and truth be told---totally disgusting. Andrew Billings also need have someone proof his story. Lauren, the protagonist was a vegan, she wore cloth Keds and hemp sandles because she abhorred leather, got rid of her Rover because of the leather seats, yet midway through the story she whips out her leather checkbook to pay her protector, Matt. Also if you find incest repulsive (I know I did and wish I had been warned first)stay away from this book."
3,Its all right.,"This game is a never ending game with no real ending to it. Some monsters look really cool and others don't. My favorite is the dragons. I got one. You can play this game forever and you really won't ""beat it"". Its a great game for those who like to train animals or monsters. The best thing is that you can put CD's and DVD's in and you get a monster out of it. You can also compete with your monster in tournaments. When your monster dies, you can just get another one. Overall, its pretty good and those who liked the Game Boy Pokemon games will probably like this."
4,A more positive appraisal,"I am concerned lest Mr. Morrison's less-than-enthusiastic review persuade others to by-pass this piece of Offenbachiana, and thus deprive themselves of a rare delight.Unlike his cello duos, primarily instructional music, Offenbach's Concerto Rondo was mischievously designed to entertain. That it does, with a degree of effervescent humor and wit which is entirely unique in the cello repertoire. It is deliciously irreverent, on the order of breaking into ""Turkey in the Straw"" just because the high-brows in the loges would have expected something Dvorakian. Profound? No. Fun? My, yes."
5,CAN NOT BEAT IT !!!! !!!!,"I GOT VERY TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TEACH MY YOUNG BOY HOW TO BUILD WITH LEGO$. WITH THE GAME I RECEIVED QUAILTY TIME, LEARNING KNOWLEDGE OF PLANE, CAR, BOAT, TRAIN, RIGHT ALONG $IDE WITH MY $ON, AND GOOD OLD FA$HION FUN. CAN NOT BEAT IT !!! NOW WE ARE PLAYING WITH MY 3 YR OLD THANKYOUI got very tired of not being able to teach my young boy how to build with Legos. With this game I received quality time, learning knowledge of planes, cars, boats, trains right along side with my son. It is good old fashion fun. Can not beat it! Now we are playing with my 3 yr old. Thank you."
3,Not so ugly.,"I've seen a few episodes of Ugly Betty. I think the series doesn't really live up to its name. This is because I don't think Betty is so ugly. I've seen worse. That's from a man's viewpoint. Virtually the only features that make her ugly are braces and red frame glasses. She should change to black frame glasses. She e.g. has a nice figure, and nice hair."
5,No Blu-Ray - No deal!,"The show was very entertaining and I looked foward to every episode no matter how silly and whacky things got! I still love that line ""you let some duck quack-off in your face""!There's no Blu-ray of the series and that's a bad thing in my book. I watched the entire show in HD on tv and I just want it on Blu-Ray disc. They frakked-up because I would've bought the entire series."
4,Ugly Betty,"I love the DVD. I just wish the producers had put the episodes in the same order on the DVD that they were broadcast on TV. I also wish they would list the original airdate. As far as Amazon goes, the service was great. I received my product quickly and for the best price I had seen anywhere!"
3,"Good start, but still a lot of work to be done in this area","It is not ""concise"", it is just very limited. It gives very few direction into Azeri grammar (if any). This book is too basic. I don't believe that it could be helpful to any English-speaking person, trying to start on their Azeri at all. May be just a bit helpful to an Azeri person with their English, but that is all."
2,Well,"On one hand it's good for new writers and on a rare instance it MIGHT help a writer that knows what he or she is doing but that is unlikely to occur. The character questionaire I use on occassion but that's really the only good thing I've found about it. Most of the rest I already knew about. Personally, if you want a good book on characterization, read ""Characters and Viewpoint"" by Orson Scott Card"
5,You need this book.,"To any and all up and coming writers out there, you need this book. I got this book a few weeks ago and my characters have improved SO much. I've already completed one book, but now I've gone back and I've already noticed how terribly put together my characters were. Now with the help of this book, I'm breathing some new life into them. Before you even start to think about putting your characters into motion, get this book which I feel to be something of a guide to interesting chracters."
5,"Handy and hey, presto!","It's gone! This is a superb little cart which works beatifully and disappears, when you are done with it, into inches. Looks sharp, too."
2,comportamiento de los animales` enciclopedia ilustrada de ci,"realmente no creo que sea lo apropiado para mi, pense que podria observar una tala de contenidos para asi saber si este libro posee lo que yo necesito consultar para a si conprarlo."
2,SHOULD HAVE STOPPED WITH SERIES ONE,"SEASON ONE OF BATTLESTAR GALACTICA WAS ONE OF THE BETTER SCI FI SHOWS CONSIDERING IT DIDNT HAVE MUTCH OF A BUDGET. IT WASNT STUPID LIKE STAR TREK WITCH HAD ALIENS WITH DIFFERNT SHAPED FORE HEADS IN EVERY EPISODE.SEASON ONE FOCUSED ON THE STRUGGLE AND ODDESY AFTER THE ALLMOST TOTAL DESTUCTION OF MANKIND FROM AN ENEMY RACE, TRYING TO FIND THE PLANET OF THE 13NTH TRIBE , THE LONG LOST BROTHERS WHO VENTURED OUT INTO SPACE 1000 YEARS AGO . THE PLANETS NAME IS EARTH. GALACTICA 1980 [SEASON TWO ] SEEMED TO LOSE THE PREMIS OF THE ORIGONAL SHOW AND TURNED INTO A COMEDY."
3,"Was not a ""variety""","For some reason I received 12 of the exact same product rather than a variety. Luckily I really like the product, but if I order a ""variety"" pack I expect to get it."
4,Did notice a difference,Just started taking this but already notice a difference. It does what it is supposed to do. Hotflashes were decreased! TRY IT!
4,Great for the price,"After my roller shade with the suction cups fell off for the umpteenth time, I looked around and found this product. It's essentially a 'do-it-yourself' window tint cling that you have to apply carefully and smooth with a credit card. It takes a little patience, but comes off the roller it's packaged with nicely - and without any creases. I may have a bubble or two under my shade, but it works great and is easy to see through - much better than the blasted roller shade."
3,Not sure how to place this,"My 8 year old 'vampire' son kept hissing in the backseat of my car that the sun is shining in his face and it was pretty annoying. I bought this because of the price, but didnt read through the reviews or the item description as to how it really is. It looks like cheap black thick plastics wrap, but it does the job. I didnt clean the inside of my car windows and it i still stuck on the glas after a month. So I give it 3 stars because, eve though it works, it really looks really tacky and cheap on my car."
1,This is a film sticker! Garbage!!!!,"Terrible looking, come on!! I dont have time to spend trying to stick this thing to my window! Dont buy this trash!"
3,Average,"In the end I wish we would have purchased something larger that would cover more of the window, but these are ok."
3,Just okay.,"This was very hard to get on even. It's been removed and placed in 3 different vehicles and transferred somewhat okay, but not as well as others I've tried. It was impossible to get smooth the first time, and forget about trying to get it smooth once it's removed. The foam roller they give you is a joke. It's nice to have it rolled up, but you can't use it for installation at all. If it's hot outside, it will not stick. If it's too cold outside, it will not stick. Just falls off.This is an okay product and it did its job for quite some time. I won't be buying any more though."
4,Works but somewhat difficult to install........,This shade really does work but it does not roll off the foam cylinder smoothly as advertised. Maybe I am doing it wrong but I did struggle a little bit to get this shade on. It still ended up with bubbles that I just couldn't smooth out but it really didn't affect my field of view. I used it on both rear side windows and the rear window itself because our baby is still rear-facing. It looks pretty cool as well and is fairly discreet unlike some of the other brands that are out there.
3,Much darker than the previous brand I purchased,"Does a good job of blocking the sun. As others mentioned, because it is darker, you need to be careful that you don't miss a car in your blind spot. While the film is rather thin, it appears to be effective."
4,very functional,"These are working well for us so far in sunny Arizona. They do bubble a bit and don't look as smooth as I expected, but are adhesing well to the windows still after a couple of weeks."
3,So-So,"This product does one thing right...it does block the sun well.However, it's annoying to put it on. I had trouble with it bubbling and with getting it on straight. Also, it doesn't cover a whole window, so the sun still gets in around it. But for the area it covers, it does a good job of blocking the sun."
1,I wish I had not bought this item.,I am not happy with this item. I managed to get the first shade to stick on one of my car windows with some difficulty but by the next morning it had fallen off and I could not get it to restick on the window. I had even less luck with the other shade. No matter what I did it would not stick to the window. It was a total waste of money and I would recommend everyone buy something else or not bother. I think I would have had better luck with plastic wrap on my window!
5,The best part is the window can still go up and down,"Even though I can't get it on without those ""bubbles"" the fact that the window goes up and down with this shade on is exactly what I was looking for. It's very basic, affordable and does block the sun without too much compromising of visibility from the inside - I definitely recommend this product."
2,Tough to install withouth bubbles,"There's no doubt that this shade blocks sun, it is just frustrating to install. Getting it straight is a challenge in itself, then getting all of the bubbles out just maikes it frustrating. I ended up going with the Britaz EZ-Cling Sun Shades. Simple to install and just as effective."
1,"Yes, it's waste of money",Hard to stick to windows. Looks really cheap with a lot of bubbles. Too small to cover windows effectively. Fortunately I found a much better product from Kmart.
5,REAL DRIVERS ONLY!!,"THIS GAME MAY NOT EXCELL IN THE GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT, BUT THE PHYSICS AND SKILL NEEDED TO DRIVE A F-1 CAR ARE REALLY ACCURATE. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO MASTER BUT THAT IS THE FUN PART. IF ONLY IT HAD A CAREER MODE IT WOULD BE THE BEST EVER!"
1,Formula One 2001 Vs Formula 1 Championship Edition,There is a PSone version available in UK and other European countries. It looks like me buying Formula 1 Championship Edition Not this. Graphics: Formula 1 Championship Edition. Gorgeous graphics. especially for a PSone game. Formula One 2001: not quite as good. not even as good as the PSone version for some reason! doesn't seem quite as realistic. Buy Formula 1 Championship Edition.
5,A must have for NAT KING COLE fans - gets beyond the overly familiar hits,"As I noted in the title, you see Nat beyond the MONA LISA ""timeless tunes"" heard so many times. His early obscuria presents a unfamiliar and very attractive side of his sound. Many jazz lovers, familiar with the hits, will say ""wow, who is that"" when listening to the 1940's New Orleans styles and female vocalists... This is a bargain too - around 9 cents for some great tunes! Not bad for a lifetime keeper for jazz lovers.a"
3,Fun for kids but falls apart easily,"My daughter has loved this book for almost a year. I gave it to her on her first birthday. After just a few weeks, it split in half. She still reads the first half, but the second half was too damaged to keep. She has many, many books that she reads a lot, and this was the first to fall apart. So, I would maybe get one Chunky Flap book and see how it goes before you buy others."
5,Great dessert,"This by far the best pudding mix, you don't see this on the store shelves.. Everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding.. and I guess most don't like to cook pudding on the stove, it is best when pudding is cooked cooked.. Instant pudding does not equal this.. Carl"
1,cook & serve choc. fudge pudding,how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding...the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding....you show the picture of it....why couldn't send it to me....it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you....pissed
5,Interesting look at early 20th century Irish folklore,"There were some of this book that I personally didn't care for-- the general feeling of total nostalgia for example. However, most of the book consists of first-hand accounts of encounters with otherworldly beings. These accounts are richly steeped in the folklore of the time and thus ought to be seen as useful in further folklore and anthropology studies.At the same time McMannus paints a compelling picture of a living countryside which provides a useful context for understanding traditional folktales.I think this work is a must-read for people studying related topics."
4,good fit ..,"its a good fit for my 1992 k2500 chevey pick up w/eight foot bed . good price , on time with no damage"
3,interesting review,"An interesting review of the status and distribution of birds in southeastern WA in the 1960's and 1970's. With its fairly recent publication date, the information provided is probably fairly close to current (2009) status of birds in this area. Knowledge of birds for this area has undoubtedly increased but it is a relatively poorly explored area and the book may reveal information that is unknown to the current crop of birders and naturalists. It is also of interest for historical purposes."
3,ordering Fiesta mugs,"The mugs are as expected (great colors), but the ordering restriction seems odd. Why could I only buy three mugs of any one color? The shipping was odd also; two different boxes one day apart."
2,Disappointed,"I strongly disagree with the other reviews. While the DVD is a good documentary of Louis Armstrong's life, it only has ""imbedded"" songs, and the menus (indexes) are not set up to go to the songs, so you have to search for them. Unless you enjoy watching the documentary over and over, this is not the way to enjoy his music. I wish I could view the songs without having to shift though a bunch of commentary. I wanted to watch him perform ""What a Wonderful World"", but it only had about a thirty second clip of that song, and there were no views of Satchmo performing that song . . . it only had a video of people showing their respect at Satchmo funeral. There really was only a couple songs showing Satchmo singing the entire song. Really disappointing throughtout."
1,Must Be Made In China,"Stuff from China may look sturdy, but there is always something about it that is cheap and is the reason it breaks for no reason.In this case, in spite of a sturdy looking handle, the connection between metal upper part and the lower, solid plastic part is the weak link because it is only about 1/8 inch square plastic. As such, I've broken two of them with average use for a few months, and I have no intention of buying another. Strongly recommend you avoid this piece of junk, and I can't understand why a company with its reputation would put out something so flimsy."
1,Weird smell and taste after using,"I got this spatula in the 6 piece set of KitchenAid gadgets. I like the size and that the spatula head is detachable from the handle for thorough cleaning. However, it has an odd smell to it, very chemical-ish. Also, I have noticed an odd taste when I use it in anything heated. Once, when making whipped cream, after scraping the bowl I tasted the whipped cream off the spatula and it was definitely what had made my other food items taste off. I don't use the spatula very often now. I have better luck with my Le Creuset spatulas and my Williams-Sonoma ones as well. So with a weird taste and smell I'd have to say two thumbs down. So disappointing especially since the size is perfect for my KitchenAid stand mixer mixing bowl. :( Too bad. I personally would not buy this again."
2,Late-model MacBook Pro owners: don't bother,"While 5.1 output might be enticing for many, you'll suffer a definite loss in quality. Low frequency response definitely suffers in music, as many critical listenings revealed for me. At times cellos would sound nearer to trombones and ProLogic II is pretty much bunk."
3,you may not need this if you are just looking for speakers,"I was not enlightened when it came to computer audio. I bought this thinking it is a speaker itself. I bought cheap Logitech speakers, and they are working in combination, but the sound quality is mostly constrained by the speakers. But, my having to go through this frustration is partly Apple's fault for not putting an adequate speaker to come with MacPro (MacBooks have much better internal speakers)."
5,"Ehmm. Raunchy, Ribald, and Randy","Much, much naughtier than my usual read, still TALKING TO ADDISON was a sublimely droll peek into the life of Holly Livingstone and Friends. The dialogue is quick paced, very British, sarcastic, witty and utterly coarse, lewd, vulgar and bawdy. An eccentric and highly amusing bit of farce that kept me laughing throughout. The reader will meet some bizarrely enchanting characters as well as learn when a kiss is NOT just a kiss. Some screamingly hysterical scenes of ""a model of a Modern Major General"" together ""with many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.""If you are missing a sense of humor or easily offended or snared in a quagmire of conformity, I would recommend giving this one a pass. Otherwise, click on ""Add to Shopping Cart"" and get ready to laugh."
1,Not worth the time and effort,I also read the reviews and decided to buy it anyways. I was able to assemble the cart only after hours of frustration and parts breaking off.I read the directions prior to assembly and made sure I took my time putting it together.The product obviously is not the best quality.Some off the small pieces that lock the cart together broke. I had to crazy glue it together.In the end I was frustrated and very dissatisfied with this product. I just hope it doesn't fall completely apart like it did when I was putting it together. Don't buy. Not worth. Buy the cloth version instead
4,worth it,"extremely difficult to put together, but so useful. i used the covered basket part for dirty clothes, the large spaces for blankets and bath towels and washclothes, the small space for shoes. when you dont have a lot of space, this organizer is the answer. it lasted about 1 year."
2,Great price but tricky to assemble,"Now that it's put together, thanks to the help of a friend who is more manually gifted than I, the cart is very handy and somewhat better-looking than I would expect for [the money]. However, I would have taken it back had I not gotten help. I absolutely could not snap 3 pieces together at once, as was required to assemble the hamper section. In order to identify the proper alignment of each individual ""side"" or ""top"" piece you have to look for a tiny raised dot on the piece's edge. Maddening."
3,Partially useful,"Unlike other reviewers, I put this item together while 9 months pregnant and had no problems at all. HOWEVER, the back 3 wheels fell off in the next few days, and continued to do so even after I superglued and staple-gunned them on. I also emailed the manufacturer about the problem who promptly sent me 6 new wheels. Too bad all 6 fell off again within 10 minutes of installing them. This also happened to my cousin who received the same item a few months before on her registry. The only reason I'd recommend this product is because (other than the wheels) it is quite sturdy and very useful in organizing baby items. However, I also registered for this item because it was easily rolled from one spot to another. Obviously I was very disappointed in this area."
1,WHAT A PAIN IS AN UNDERSTATMENT,I CAN NEVER WAIT FOR MY HUSBAND TO PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER SO I DECIDED TO ALSO TRY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER WHEN I WAS ABOUT 8 MONTHS PREGNANT. WHAT A MISTAKE--- IT TOOK ME ABOUT 2 HOURS AND SEVERAL OF THE PIECES WERE BROKEN ONCE I FINISHED.IF THIS ITEM WASN'T IN SUCH BAD SHAPE WHEN I FINISHED I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT BACK TO THE STORE. I CAME UP WITH AN IDEA I USED THE WHITE CABLE TIES TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IN SEVERAL PLACES. I RECOMMEND CONSIDERING ANOTHER PRODUCT.
3,Does its job,It is true that it took some time to put together but patience is a virtue. I use it for diapers and blankets and some quick change clothes the hamper is a pretty cool feature too.
1,Nearly impossible!,"This was nearly impossible to get together. My hands were extremely sore after attempting to assemble this product. Just as one piece would snap together, another would come apart! I think I finally have it together, although one side of the lid that holds it in place broke off in the process. Also, I don't have the wheels on it because it is impossible to get them to snap into the clip unit. I put them on a hard surface as the instructions say to, and put all my weight on it and they will not snap in. I have tried all six of them. I just hope that once it is in place and things are put on it that it will stay together!"
1,AWFUL!!,"I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING PRODUCT, I STILL BOUGHT IT ANYWAY... I READ THE DIRECTIONS TO A TEE AND IT STILL TOOK ME ABOUT 1.5 HOURS TO PUT TOGETHER. MY THUMBS HURT SO SO BAD. I CUT MY FINGER AND BENT A NAIL BACKWARDS GETTING THIS TOGETHER. THEN WHEN IT WAS FULLY TOGETHER I WAS MISSING A WHEEL!!! I WOULD RATHER HAD PLASTIC DRAWERS FROM WALMART THEN THIS... GOOD LUCK!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever bought. By the time I figured out you must be insane to understand the assembly process, I couldn't take it back because I had already broken two pieces. Not only that, but I would have been embarressed to take it back with several fingers and the back of my hand bleeding. After a long war, I finally won, but the unit is unstable and doesn't hold much of anything. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Don't buy this!,"This is a peice of junk. It was very difficult to put together, and ending up breaking in a few places while I put it together. It is not very sturdy, and the assembly directions are terrible."
2,Good price but very hard to put together!,I always thought that my entertainment center was the hardest thing I have put together but this one takes the cake. It took me forever!! You also need muscle power or a hammer to get it in place. The box says that it is easy to put together but it isnt!
3,Not too bad...,"Took me a while to figure out how to put it together, but once I got the hang of it I put it together fairly fast. Took me about an hour from start to finish. The directions are terrible. The other thing that I had a problem with is that the lid for the top storage area was warped pretty bad which made it unusable. A couple of the shelves were warped as well, but not enough to make them not work. It is fairly stable, but you are truely getting what you pay for here. If you have the money I would go with something else."
2,Was Cute But a Pain to assemble,I loved this in the box at babiesrus and then I purchased it at Target during my pregnancy I thought what a perfect thing to put all the Babys extra stuff blankets etc.... Well as i tried to assemble at 9 months pregnant I was very furious that I could not get this product to set up 1-2-3 it took forever and the wheels broke off it was a MESSSSS
2,it was a puzzle,it was hard to put together and the directions helped only a little. it two hours to do!!!! but it works good.
2,my hands hurt,"oh my goodness! it took the two of us to put it together and it took about an hour!, as soon as i got one side together the other side came apart, and i broke about two pieces. now that its together i really like it but it was not worth the fustration"
3,helpful but not a necessity,"We bought this for a helpful organizer, and yes it was terrribly difficult to put together! After it was together we put everything in it and it is very sturdy though.Problem though: When you are putting the wheels on the bottom be very careful, when your sliding the flat part into the bracket, the brackets might break off. Thats what happened to us. They have and uneven amount of brackets to slide the wheels on and when you try to wiggle it in there they snap off. We just ended up snapping off all the wheels because it was so uneven. Helpful to have but without the wheels you might as well go buy one from another brand that already has the wheel on them."
3,great item; difficult assembly,"Once assembled this item proved its worth by saving a lot of space in our little girls room. I would recommend others to purchase it. The only drawback was putting it together. My husband cut himself several times putting the casters on and some of the pieces were very difficult to ""snap"" into place."
4,Nice product,"After reading the reviews on this product I wasn't sure if I should buy this, but I did anyhow. My husband put it together without any problems. We bought because we are not buying a changing table this cart can hold all his diapering needs and etc."
1,HORRIBLE,ITS A PAIN TO PUT TOGETHER AND THEN TWO PIECES BROKE THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO SNAP INTO THE OTHER PARTS. I EXCHANGED IT FOR A NEW ONE AND AGAIN I COULD NOT PUT IT TOGETHER EASILY. I ONLY WANTED IT FOR THE LIVING ROOM SO I WOULD HAVE THINGS ON HAND AND MY MOTHER COULD FIND THINGS EASILY WHEN SHE WATCHED HER INSTEAD OF GOING BACK AND FORTH TO HER NURSERY. IT WASN'T TO STURDY SO I GAVE IT AWAY. I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BOTHER RETURNING IT AGAIN.
3,Great designs to copy,"The patterns and designs in this book are large and are ideal for the artist or craftsperson who is looking for a design to copy. However, there are no instructions or suggestions for how to use the designs and patterns shown. Because of this I wouldn't recommend this as a beginning place for the craftsperson looking for Celtic designs.If you are looking for more instruction on how to adapt the designs for the particular craft you are engaging in, I would look elsewhere. But if you are already fairly proficient in your craft and also somewhat familiar with Celtic art, this is a terrific resource. A similar book which also has large designs to color in is Courtney Davis' book Knotwork and Spiral Patterns."
5,Affordable LR44 Batteries,These are the ticket for your child's talking books without paying outrageous prices at the brick and mortar stores. No issues with battery life so far.
3,"okay, but not too revealing","I've been a fan of Dworkin ever since I read her ""Letters from a Warzone"". She's a brilliant polemicist. ""Scapegoat"", though, was a little too bland. There is nothing truly radical or revelatory about it, unless the reader is an extremist already. She dealed a little with the issue of the Palestinian becoming the ""new scapegoat"", but didn't go as far as many other authors have. For someone that has critiqued the construction of gender, I find it odd that she hasn't critiqued the construction of race. Instead, she embraces the idea of race and, in my mind, just reinforces racial divisions.All of this aside, it still had a number of enjoyable parts. It was not, however, as interesting and important as previous books she has written."
2,Too Heavy to be Used Often...,"I found the spoon to be too big and too heavy for the average female hand.It would only be useful if cooking in a huge caldron.Once again, I was taken in because I wanted the color."
2,"Cheap little guitar, very ashamed.","This cheap thing is not good at all. The whammy bar wont even adjust, I sold on amazon, hope the other person likes it. The Fret buttons are different from the original. The bar is wider and harder to hit the buttons. The only thing i like is the plug in charger if you dont have batteries, but that gets rid of the whole wireless aspect. Very dissapointed on the guitar."
3,YOU CAN DO BETTER!!!,"I bought this guitar and I have a few things to say about it that are unfortunately negative.1. My Starpower is on the fritz.2. The buttons are akward and small.3. The strap setup isn't like the one for the Xbox 360. After a short while, it gets uncomfortable to strum.4. My strum bar came a little loose and is very squeaky.5. The whammy bar hardly works.It still works, but it's a last resort for me. A better investment is the wireless one that RedOctane made. There is no lag and its perfect in my opinion. I have still have yet to try out the Freedom V's though, I am hoping that those will be good. Happy rocking!"
2,Not the best.,"I'd suggest buying a different guitar, this one works and all but isn't as good as others. The star power doesn't always work, but other than that all's fine."
4,Steel Sheave????,"Well made, but I was expecting a steel sheave, which I am pretty sure it is not. I could be wrong, but the sheave is gold colored and any others I have seen with that color are NOT steel. I was looking to run cable thru it, so it will probably get chewed up after a while. Otherwise, decent unit."
5,About the Author,"Reviewers: For your information ""Frederick Busch, who wrote 27 books, died February 23, 2006. He was 64 and lived in Shelburne, NY.""Taken from the Boston Globe."
2,"Not bad, but . . . .","I read lots of DragonLance books. And so I read this one. I expected more. It flowed okay. It was written okay. I just wanted more action. And I wanted the action to seem more realistic. So, overall it was an okay read. But I was a bit disappointed. I'll read his next to see if it is better."
2,damaged dvd,the movies are great unfortunately these must be used since the french connection dvd skipped and had visible damage on the disc.
2,Sentimental tacky crap,"I will act as the lone dissenter from the crowd and say that my husband and I both thought that Boomtown was slow-moving, poorly acted, overly contrived, and well... BORING. Written by the same guy who did the similarly schmaltzy saccharine Band of Brothers, Boomtown was The Shield except... the crimes were boring... and the characters were boring... and the trope of seeing the same event through many eyes gets old fast.If you want a great crime drama that gives you a sense of LA, the city, and is character driven and written by people with actual talent, check out the Shield and don't get tricked into thinking Boomtown is brilliant."
5,One of the Best shows on Television,"Cancelling this wonderful unique series has to be NBC's biggest regret. The plot was fantastic and the acting was top rate. Sadly, people would rather watch crap reality TV than great quality shows such as this one. It probably would have done better on today's cable. Neal McDonough, one of the most underrated actors ever, gives a remarkable performance as David McNorris, probably the best reason to pick up this series and watch it. You will not be disappointed.TOP RATE! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"
1,ONE STAR TOO MANY - THIS IS CRAP,"I am not sure which family members wrote the positive reviews, but they had to be related. There is absolutely no excuse for releasing this drivel. The lyrics are obnoxious and dumb enough to irritate a 10 year old. The female singer makes scratching the blackboard sound good. She must be MS Z. You'd have to be completely tone deaf to hire her. Actualy, TONE DEAF - that also explains the chicken scratching that is supposed to pass for guitar playing. Every horrible cliche gets recycled in these insipid songs. Buy ANYTHING else, it can't be any worse than this stuff."
1,Appalling - damaged & poorly manufactured product,"Obviously poorly manufactured as parts arrived with very visible scratches on the edges of every shelf & support strut (2-5 inch reddish scratches in the black finish, visible from 6-10 feet away, probably due to poor application of the black finish over the underlying material). Packaging was very good, so unlikely to be a shipping issue. Do not buy this item if you plan to have it visible in your living room! I'd return it but it is a pain to assemble/disassemble & ship back. By the way, assembly isn't very easy either!"
2,Meh...,"Wasn't fully painted, and the shelves all tilted a different way once put together so from the side it looks stupid. Not enough to make me return it but not real happy with it either."
3,"Looks great, but a b**ch to put together!","This arrived very quickly and was priced just right. When I opened the box, it was very well packed, but there were no directions. NO DIRECTIONS, so if you are not good with puzzels, this is not the shelf for you! It took us days to figure out how to put this thing together. It was not easy to put together and is not the most solid shelf - but looks great. We had several extra wooden pegs left over and a couple of the holes didn't seem to be drilled straight, but we 'made' it work. It seems stable against the wall, but is a little shakey from side to side. I won't be placing precious crystal on it, but it definately does exactly what I bought it for."
1,Not solid enough,"The unit stands well, but is a bit warped, which comes down to the pegs being incorrectly lined up I guess. But the top level shelf did break and split, causing all that was on that shelf to slide down which broke a few things we had on it."
3,Difficult,"I am not someone who is comfortable with a hammer and nails. This bookcase which says only some assembly required and that it's not difficult is wrong --- at least from the standpoint of someone not used to putting things together. The item itself is beautiful, the wood is nice and, once assembled, would be a nice addition. Sadly, I am putting it away until I can find a handyman and assistant to put it together for me. this is only MY impressions --- please take that into consideration when you read this..."
4,Great for the money!,"I'm very happy with this purchase. I even was able to put it together myself. Of course it would've been easier with another person, but it is very doable on your own."
2,falls apart,The assembly is difficult and kind of unclear. Parts have fallen off before I even used it so now I can't use the bottom two shelves correctly- so the wood is splintering. Ideally it would look really nice but I wouldn't buy this or recommend it to anyone.
1,"poorly designed, do not buy",poorly designed product -- not all the pieces fit. i ended up having to throw away the top part of the shelf. the price is cheap but so is the product. would not recommend investing any amount of money into this product.
4,overall good,"looked great after i assembled it. that being said. was not exactly easy to assemble. the holes didnt line up, the instructions were wrong and some of the pieces didnt fit. I mean i nothing major enough that a little ingenuity couldnt fix. my gf loved it so 4 stars"
1,Watch out for poor quality,"This bookshelf is sleek and smooth and I agree with the other reviewers in that it is not meant for heavy books. However, I would not recommend it. To put it together you basically build each half then put the halves together. When I received mine the place where the two halves line up did NOT line up quite right and there is a visible gap where two halves meet. So it's doable but very obvious and visible where this shelf was put together. If this was from a store, I'd def return it but I hate the hassle of returning online items so I'm not going to bother."
1,Pre-drilled Screw Holes Were Too Big for the Provided Screws,"My sister tried to put this together while I was at work. Unfortunately, instead of stopping when she discovered the screw holes were too big she tried to improvise with duct tape and super glue. About 10 minutes after she got it up the kittens jumped on it and the whole shebang came crashing down. If she had not put it together, I would have returned it, but the broken pieces were our fault. Well, mostly anyway, a wooden bookshelf should really be sturdy enough to not break into pieces when 2 six month old kittens jump up on it. I don't recommend this item at all."
2,Looks great and easy to assemble,"I love this bookshelf. I've already filled it up and will have to buy another. It looks great with my modern furniture and was so easy to put together. The directions said that it requires 2 people to assemble, but I was able to put it together easily by myself and I'm pregnant in my 3rd trimester. It also came with 2 straps to be able to attach it to the wall for child safety (most other furniture only comes with one strap). I will definitely buy a matching bookshelf in the future.UPDATE : I've changed my rating to a 2 star. One of the shelves broke the other day under the weight of our books. We've had it less than 6 months. Why get a bookshelf that can't hold books. It seems this product was meant for decoration only. I need to buy a new bookshelf."
5,Fantastic Product,"These shelves are a cinch to assemble and crazy strong. I've got four of them in my room right now.The total construction time was under 90 minutes, and I probably could have done it faster if I'd wanted to. Assembly couldn't be simpler.I have LOTS of books. Like, LOTS. Hardcover, paperback, digest, omnibus, comics, LOTS AND LOTS of books is the idea. And these shelves hold the weight with no complaints.On top of that, they're a gorgeous color, a really rich, deep black.If I ever need another bookcase, these will be my first stop."
5,Like the shelf,I Really like the shelf. It was easy to put together and it looks great. I'm going to order another one.
3,YOU DONT GET ALL WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!,"The book shelf arrived on time and all the parts were in the box. It didn't take long to assemble and I am not a ""handy"" type of gal. Nonetheless, some of the screws didn't fit and there were very visible gaps within the body of the book shelf once assembled. I bought the missing screws from a local hardware store and was able to get it up with no problem...please be warned it is not sturdy enough to hold anything more than what you see in the picture and after its assembly it doesn't look as good as the picture...but it is ""cute"" for a small apartment...I think that it is a little overpriced for the outcome..."
3,"Gives lots of tips, however, may be better beginner books","As advertised, the authors give you lots of tips and techniques for your model train layout, garnered from their years of experience.While the book covers all the bases, it doesn't really go into great detail on anyone. Rather it gives you a overview and a list of other books to read/buy. In this aspect, there may be better, more detailed books that a beginning model train enthusiast should spend their money on."
4,TIPS GALORE FOR TOY TRAIN LAYOUTS,"This book is basically the accounting of building a major toy train layout. It goes over the basic ideas and what problems and mistakes where made in the contruction. The ""gems"" of the book are all the helpful hints and tips offered. You may never do a layout as large as the one in the book but you will find something that will help you out or make you think differently. The two gentlemen that wrote the book are both ""legends"" in the toy train world. Good stuff for the expert and the beginner."
4,I Love Lucha Villa,Her huskey voice is one of the true treasures of Mexico's heritage. There is no one else like her. I have scoured music stores in various parts of Mexico for every recording I've ever been able to find by her. I have over 20 now.
2,Waste,"After about a month this thing was useless. I think the cover looks good, loved the clip in the back, it protected my Razr well. I wore the phone on my hip and after a month, I noticed the front cover shell was gone, fell off somewhere. I think after awhile, the grip looses it's will to grip."
3,Shell Black Motorola RAZR V3's not all its cracked up to be.,"Although the cover is indeed very attrative and provides excellent comfort, the cover cracked only 1 week after I bought it, without it having been dropped. Now it keeps sliding off the phone."
4,Very Sweet Reading,"This was an enjoyable book. The characters were very believable. Despite the fact this was a marriage of convenience, Beth and Darius made the best of it. Of course as their relationship matures they find not only the love each of them desires, but Darius finds a woman who is trustworthy and Beth a man who gives her the family she always wanted.The secondary characters were all delightful from the servants (Munke, Maggie, Kelso & Billy the stable hand) to the horrible sisters and Dowager Duchess. Dorie (Beth's young cousin) was especially delightful!This book was a little slow moving at times but worth getting through those slow parts to the moving ending!"
5,Great Repair Guide,"This book is well illustrated, very straightforward, and easy to read with step-by-step instructions. I highly recommend it as a reference for all serious cyclists and anyone wanting to do their own bicycle maintenance & repair. This concise book deserves a place in all bicycle repair shops.WP FlemingSanta Fe Bikes & GallerySanta Fe, New Mexico"
5,USAF,USAF is a great game! I mean it! I would understand if someone had a problem with it. That problem would probably be that it is very complex- the same with every other Janes or Electronic Arts gamesGet this game now!!!!
2,When You Age,".... It took me many days to get my joystick to work with this program. Yet, you still need to use the keyboard when you want to slow down, use the breaks, and release the landing gear. I flew a little and it made my head spin. Some years ago I would recover from my dizziness and would go right on playing. But now it is just not fun anymore. This program does not make me forget that it is computer-generated planes I am trying to shoot down. When you see the real planes the program is attempting to simulate, even if it is just on TV, you will always think about how pale this electronic imitation really is. .... Still, strategy games of war are fun for me, while this is an exercise in getting dizzy and disoriented."
1,YUCK!!!,"This sounds like a great Christmas CD except for the song ""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer"" ... I hate this song and refuse to buy any music collection that includes it."
5,Excellent Addition For Christmas,"This CD is an excellent addition to anyone's holiday music collection. It features songs by old and new artists ranging from the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon to Britney Spears, N Sync, and Celine Dion. I must admit I enjoyed the older songs more, but the new songs still get play on my stereo.This is a must have for anyone searching for a great holiday album this Christmas."
3,About a Discs Worth of Good Christmas Music,"Can't really disagree with the other ""lukewarm"" reviews. Disc one is pretty solid - a nice overview of songs generally regarded as Christmas Classics. After the first 3 songs on side two, things go downhill pretty fast. I can't imagine anyone in 2-3 years getting nostalgic for Christmas music from ""Joe,"" whoever that is, Brittney Spears or N'Sync. Those artists seemed to have been thrown in there in the hopes of attracting a younger crowd of buyers. Still worth having for side one - some of these songs, such as the Bowie/Bing Crosby duet off of Bing Crosby's Christmas Special, are pretty hard to find."
4,Disc one is better than disc two,"A pretty good collection by any standard, but the inclusion of Michael Bolton, Gloria Estefan, Britney Spears, etc. kind of ruin the second disc. (But the first four tunes on that disc are great!)"
2,Hmph,"A christmas CD indeed. Yeah, there are some tracks on here that you need for Chirstmas, but it could've (read: should've) been one disc. Get Britney, NSync, and Boyz II Men off here. If you want some contemporary twists on classic christmas tunes, you should pick up a copy of ""(It's a Punk & Ska) Christmas Gone Wrong!"" if you can find it."
5,Quite worthwhile,"I thought this entire pack was quite fun and very cheap compared to buying everything sepratley. (Sorry im not a good speller.) Sim life has so many variables, Theme park you can have a very funny time, Theme hospital is almost addicting,and the rest are fun as every now and then games. Plus buing all else is over 30$. Thanx for listinging to me ramble."
4,Perfect for 4-year-old boys,"My son got this from Santa. In the last three weeks, I can't count the number of times he's watched it. He laughs and laughs at things only he recognizes as funny. Personally, I think the Norman character is unrealistically naughty, and really, all the characters are one-dimensional which is why I only gave it four stars. But when you're 4, I guess it doesn't matter, so he'd give it five stars."
4,Great GPS in a small package,"This is a great GPS system. The base map is fairly detailed and the unit is very easy to navigate. I was trying to decide between the new Magellan Meridian series and a couple of Garmin models. What sold me was the button layout and larger display on the Meridian series. The Gold had more base memory than the standard Meridian and the same amount of memory as the more expensive Platinum unit, so I went for the middle ground.I have used the unit a couple of time for Geocaching and had no significant problems even under tree cover. It is winter so the reception may not be as good when the trees start to get their leaves. Great overall system. I have not tried it with any add on map systems."
3,ZUNE HARD CASE,I LOVE THE PROTECTIVE CASE BUT WISH THAT THE PLASTIC COVERING OVER THE TOUCH SCREEN WOULD ALLOW USE OF ZUNE WITHOUT HAVING TO OPEN THE CASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THE SKINS YOU BUY TO COVER TOUCH SCREENS ON OTHER DEVICES.
5,This book is a gem!,"Just bought a copy of this book and loved it! For every Ford owner who wants to part restore and part modify their Ford this book tells you what you need to know and why.The general idea is to leave the exterior original but bring the rest of the car up to date by upgrading engines,suspensions,etc.This book will give you plenty of advice and ideas to transform your classic Ford to match modern cars.From 4.6 Litre V8's to suspension and steering upgrades and so on.This book will help you create a car for you.This book covers the lot.A good size book that covers so much and its good value.If you are thinking about your next automotive project Ford this book will help you."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this book to help me make improvements to my Mustang. It is touted a source to show you how to update your Mustang to drive more like today's cars. Instead I got a book that gives you ideas on what to do, but doesn't show how to do it.If you own a classic Mustang then you already know that the brakes need to be updated, that the seats could be better, and everything else this book ""teaches"" you. What I want is a book to show me how to do it. That is not this book."
1,Worst International Usability,This game do not work on the computers whose regional settings are for Turkey and language is Turkish. There is no support for this game like the European version Football Manager 2007. The game play may be good but I couldn't have a chance to play it yet. According to my opinion do not buy this game. Buy the FM2007 version of it. Sure has great differences. And FM is far better than WSM.
5,Award Winner for Book Design,"This book has won a Southern Books Competition Award of Honorable Mention for Book Design from the Southeastern Library Association. This award is given in recognition of the book's aesthetic appeal and design and for fine craftsmanship in its printing and binding. Congratulations to photographer Philip Gould, author Jason Berry, designer Laura Roubique Gleason, printer Dai Nippon Printing, and the Louisiana State University Press."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this DVD player as a replacement for my existing DVD player solely for the purpose of converting my DVD movies to 1080i HD on my Sony LCD widescreen TV. An HDMI plug is not furnished with the unit and the additional cost of an HDMI plug is as much or more than the player itself. After connecting the unit and setting it up according to the onscreen menu instructions, I inserted several different commercially purchased movies and was not able to detect any visible difference in the picture quality as compared with my older unit. Trying the component video jacks in place of the HDMI plug resulted in no improvement in picture quality. I have emailed the Panasonic website, technical support department for assistance but after 3 days have still had no reply. If you're looking to enhance your DVD's to high definition, this is probably not the unit to buy."
3,"""Rock and Roll's a loser's game/ it mesmerizes and I can't Explain...""","Wow...all the other reviewers here sound like they've been to the Cameron Crowe school of adjectives. Ok, truth is, I have Ian with Ronno and the ""Welcome To The Club"" band, so I'm in no great rush to hear his songs mangled by JC Mellonhead's guitarist. But Ralpher is on here fairly prominently, so, until IH releases stuff that he did PRE-MTV....like I said, I will wind up buying this. 6/20 - it arrived yesterday. It's wonderful to see and hear Ralpher again - and, in truth, the price you pay for this thing is justified, just to watch/hear Mick Ralphs actually play the immortal riff that IS All The Young Dudes."" And Tracy is a stone HOTTIE, but somebody needs to stick a sock in that brat from ""Def Leppard"" & Brian May's mouths, and....oh, you know, I'm sorry ; I've said it all before: stick to pre- ""Welcome To The Club"" stuff."

3,"OK, not Superlative","Good basic info on Spirulina and other alge products, which was my main interest.I would buy it again at the same price offered."
2,Disgusted!!!!!,"Granted I only paid about $9.00 tax included for this product. But when it disintegrates before your eyes when basting a simple ham, one wonders if KitchenAid is playing us for fools. It dissolved to nothing on the very first use. I will buy the silicone brush from QVC as recommended by a previous reviewer.I gave it two stars for the look (very attractive) not for function."
5,Historical Treat,"""A Name of Her Own"" by Jane Kirkpatrick is a saga of one woman'sstrength and courage as she journeys from St Louis with her often abusive husband, her two sons and a band of adventurers in search of a direct route to the Pacific Ocean. Marie, Femme to her husband, endures the rigors of travel with quiet determination. Although she often questions her own ability, she becomes an example for all those who share the trials of the trail. Kirkpatrick's narrative is engrossing, sometimes sad but always inspirational. I look forward to reading more from this talented author...."
5,Excellent Suspense Thriller!,"This is a fantastic read. What I like most about it is that intiguing historical facts are explored in detail (much like her previous books). If you like suspense based in real world settings, this is the book for you. Highly recommended!"
3,Grand-daughter was not overly excited,"Maybe it was the excitement of the day, but she wasn't overjoyed with it. Maybe to many toys for Christmas!"
2,Unsatisfied,"I was quite disappointed with the book I received from this seller. They listed it as ""used, very good"" but when the product arrived it was definitely used, but not in ""very good"" condition. The binding had significant tearing on it and was mostly peeled away at the bottom. It was definitely not something I would be able to use as a gift, as intended. I will not be buying from this seller again."
1,Dear Zoo,"I am very disappointed in this book and I've decided not to read it to my toddler. It's very negative...and points out that there's something wrong with each animal. When the child receives each animal and finds the deficit, he/she sends them back. Lame."
4,"Very cute, toddler friendly","I bought this book about a month ago for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter. She is really into animals and loves going to the zoo. The book is very simple but cute. After reading it to my daughter a few times she knows what things describe each animal. She will see a picture of a frog somewhere and say ""Frog too jumpy"" It is a great book to get young kids into reading. She loves the flaps and the sentances are short so she will ""read"" it to me at bedtime. All in all its a fav at our house"
5,A favorite,"This is a favorite book to be read at bedtime. The flaps are fun, and my son enjoyed making animal noises for the animals, too, or being the one to identify what animal was under the flap. When he was 1.5-2, he could not get enough of this book and we read it time after time. He still likes it now at three, but reading it once or twice a week is enough now. :)"
5,Fun Reading and Playing Book,Our 18 month old loves books with flaps and can be a bit tough on them. This book has held up well against all of his pulling and tugging and still in one piece. Love it.
4,Daughter loves this book,DD is 11 months and just started loving this and other touch/feel books. We got as a gift and she largely ignored for a few months even though we read her books every night. Now she can't read it enough.
1,Stay Away!,Mine is not even 2 weeks old and it is dead. It either won't turn on or it suddenly dies after 10-15 seconds. New batteries didn't help. After visiting several internet chat rooms I discovered that this is a widespread problem. According to other owners Magellan is not being very helpful. Save yourself a lot of grief and buy a Garmin. From what I have seen this problem is limited to the Platinum and the possibly the Gold.
2,Extremely non-intuitive/painful set up/poor documentation,"I bought this for my wife to use in her car as she travels a fair amount for work. The reviews that I saw were good, so I picked this over the Garmin unit based on that and the price difference. WRONG!!! The set up for this is incredibly poor, as is the documentation. It takes forever to load maps (once you get that software set up) unless you have an SD Card Programmer (they don't tell you what that is either). The expansion slot is hidden underneath the batteries, so if you have to swap SD Cards to move to a new region, you have to remove the batteries first.Once you do get everything set up it works OK, but if you want something to help navigate the highways and byways of America without getting lost you'd do better with something dedicated to that (either the Garmin or a nice set of paper maps).I won't be buying anything more from Magellan."
4,Good GPS,"Although this GPS has great functionality, it goes through batteries quickly. I always carry spares. I highly recommend the cigarette lighter adapter."
4,A year ago it got 5 stars,"Time is passing. Moore's law applies to GPS, too.I loved it when I got it, have used it extensively, and happily.But, by today's standards, the screen is too small, the images on the screen are too small, and the odd shape, while comfortable for a hand held, is awkward for the dashboard of a car, or even the desk beside the PC. There are odd constraints on usage of large capacity SD-MMC chips, and the mapping software that works with it doesn't do its job well, either.I _still_ carry a real compass in the woods or on the water, and bring extra batteries and a paper chart or two (or more). If it is loose in a boat, I'd put it in a clear, waterproof, container of some sort, at least in a zip-lock bag or the equivalent....I'm glad I bought mine, but if I was getting one today I'd look for a serious, heavy, discount."
3,Fine,"These floor mats are fine. They are a bit inclined to move around a bit. I won't be returning them, but I would have preferred that It have those little carpet spikes in the bottom of it."
1,Not For Those Wishing Description of Antartica Exploration,"From the title I thought this book would give a comparison of the explorations of Scott, Shackleton, and Amundsen. I does not. Instead, it is a tedious and repetitious exploration of Scott's character and how it led to his failure."
4,Nora Roberts fan,I have read almost all of Nora Roberts MacGregor books. I LOVED this book! I didn't really care that much about the first section D.C. but the rest of the book was wonderful. That's why I gave four stars insted of five stars. But if you are just starting to read the MacGregor books I would start with Serna and Caine if you start with this book you will be lost.
1,Not up to her usual standards,"A regular Nora Roberts fan, I was very disappointed by this book. In fact, I didn't even begin the story of the second brother. If you go to a bookstore, I recommend reading the first several pages to get a feel of this book, BEFORE buying it."
5,A must buy,"This is a book for the serious monochrome photographer who is interested in more than just manipulating oixels.A renowned british photographer, Blakemore takes the reader on a personal journey through the making of several series of images, including tulips, still life and landscape. There is a chapter on the zone system which is not technical - you don't have to be a fan of the system to read this book, but his discussion is thoughtful and insightful.Every time I want some inspiration this is one of the books I pickup and reread or just browse. Highly recommended."
1,Do I smell rotten eggs?,"No it's just Joni James' new comeback CD, as if her lp's in the 50's weren't bad enough(not to mention her country hit singles). It's not the songs that were bad, at lest not on her lp's for MGM. Her MGM lp's featured sateful arrangemets and good standard tunes, it's her clumsy phrasing, and lack of swing(you'd think she never heard a Louis Armstrong album before). Her annoying lack of any sort of swing or rhythm, and her oddball phrasing make her just above Patti Page & Teresa Brewer, but nowbere near the great Rosemary Cloone, Keely Smith or Doris Day, and light years away from Ella Fitzgerald.James sounds like the same awful singer she was in the 50's, yet she's singing some new awful tunes(no standards). With an older warn out sounding voice. Stick with Keely Smith & Rosemary Clooney who are still going strong today, and singing jazz standards with swing and verve. Stay away from the rotten eggs, I mean Joni James."
1,Cheezy MUZAK at it's worst...,"If you like Patti Page, and Teresa Brewer you'll love this. If you liked her cheezy ""you're hit parade"" sounding songs in the 50's, you'll love this modern day MUZAK. I'm sure this stuff will be played in elevators and grocery store everywhere. For me I'll stick with June Christy, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Anita O'Day and Chris Connor. Note: if you respect jazz singing don't buy this CD."
2,Joni your voice is still pretty enough...,But get rid of the background singers already and do an album of jazz standards with a jazz trio...
1,Revolting film should be put in the trash where it belongs,"""Edmond"" will certainly test your levels of tolerance for foul language, racist epiphets, and violence - sexual or otherwise. It's meant to be visceral but it just comes across as gratuitous - not to mention tasteless.It's a filmization of a 1982 David Mamet play and reflects is stagey origins in its claustophobic sets and artificial situations. The descent that Edmond (played by William H. Macy) takes from respectability to madness is not convincing and one is continually asking ""what exactly is the point?"".""Edmond"" is hopelessly dated and shallow and it was a big mistake to resurrect it on screen. This low budget film leaves you with a really bad taste in the mouth. Hold your nose and put this putrid mess in the trash where it belongs."
2,effective,"Much of the film is predictable but I watched it mainly to see how far it would go. The main character in this film who comes across as mild mannered gets kicked out by his wife which starts a cascade of negative reactions. Frustrated over his situation, he takes to the streets going to strip joints, peep shows and massage parlors. As the night goes on, he runs into street hustlers and puts his life at risk, getting mugged. Finally, his rage gets the best of him and then he puts himself in the last place he'd want to be. Then he has no other choice but to be content in his position and make the best of it. Ironically, in some ways it seems he has finally come to terms with himself and is better off than he had been with his wife."
1,Who do i talk to about getting the last hour and 22 minutes of my life back?,I went into watching this movie with great expectations.....and was slapped by the back hand called Edmund. This movie only did not live up what the trailer protrayed it to be but was also slow moving and confusing at the end! If you are looking to kill an hour and a half of your life go get a root canal.....don't waste it watching this movie!
3,Good product with an expensive label.,"This battery can hold its charge fairly long and its charge time is fast, so far (less than 3 hours)."
1,Not thick as usual mascara,"I have to apply it about 5 times before i see normal result. I would describe it as very ""liquidy""."
3,dented but ok,This was the second one shipped. The first was had a broken mount and several dents. This one had a small dent on the water pump line but didn't effect how it worked. I would rate it better if they learned how to pack it better.
1,Bad Recording,"I purchased this DTS because I love the surround sound of DTS, but I am very disappointed with this CD. This was a replacement for the same album CD which because I heard skipping like the old fashion records and did not get the DTS affects,, I returned it and asked for a replacement. I should had asked for my money back instead, this replacement I received has the same problem.I would not recommend this DTS to anyone, they should all be pulled back (recalled) and redone."
5,a must read,"Josef Pieper is one of my favorite contemporary philosophers. He gives you all the commonsense, all the grandeur, all the Truth that has passed down through history, all the way back to Aquinas, to Augustine, to Paul, to Christ. What more dare we ask for?"
4,Brake Disc,"Great replacement part, perfect fit, great quality. Far cheaper than anything local. I would have had to custom order. Brembo is quality."
5,A boy finds a companion in a spunky little doll,"Impunity Jane is a Victorian pocket doll who years for adventure. Without a trace of sticky-sweetness, Godden shows us a restless doll consigned for four generations to sitting in a dollhouse, sometimes neglected for years, until she is purloined by a 7-year-old cousin, Gideon, who can hear doll wishes. Then Impunity Jane's life begins! She is a devoted companion in Gideon's play and gets to be a sailor, an aviator, a miner, and enjoy all manner of adventures. Gideon faces being called a ""sissy"" by a gang of older boys, until tough little Impunity Jane manages to win them over. Yet the guilt of her being stolen weighs heavily on both the boy and the doll, and they know they must do the honorable thing ...This story is also included in the Rumer Godden collection ""Four Dolls."""
1,Deceptive little orange thingies,"Executive Summary: Use Mack's earplugs. I am becoming a huge fan of them after dealing with all of the other earplugs.Details:Cool! 40 cents for some earplugs; they are bright and will be perfect when I go camping! Or will they...?I can't get these to work either. i feel a little earplug dumb right now, but I can't get these to stay in my ears.The ""directions"" on the little packaging are a little strange. i tried to put the earplug in exactly the way they showed. No luck. I squeezed and pushed. Could hear absolutely everything I didn't want to hear.I will keep trying because now I have them (and spent a lot on shipping!!), but I really think Mack's earplugs are better suited for me."
5,"Wow, yet another one I love!",This band is amazing. Most of you out there have heard of The Clash. Well this band definatly brings back that nostalgia. Amazing beats very up beat and makes you want to smile and move. Yet another band that I think is amazing and again not from the USA. :) Rock on England! Rock on! Keep bringing out those bands that the world will rock to.
1,no warrentee,"I've had this cord for a few years . It worked good , but when the ground plug fell out i realized that the home depot and lowe's stopped selling them . I have been e- mailing coleman cable ( found they made this )and never have gotten a reply . Now I know why the big stores don't sell them . There is no customer service ! Maybe this review will get their attention . Buyers beware of these people . When I bought this I thought there was a warrentee . Guess not !"
5,"Excelent Memory, Great Price","I bougth this memory for a friend's PC, he had only 512 MB of RAM & his system was too slow. I was looking for a 1G RAM with the same bus speed. I think I had a great deal for a reasonable price. It arrived just 1 week since I ordered it. The installation was very easy, just plugged it in and it was working.I fully recomend the Kingston brand."
5,Worked fine and increased PC Speed,This was easy in insert and worked with my existing 512K stick I had when I orgainally built my PC. Great product for the low price.
5,what it should be,It's RAM what can I really say I got it took it out of the container put it in the computer it worked. I'm happy! Way less expensive than any other I have seen.
1,OUT $$$ IN HOUSTON,"I bought 2 Kingston ValueRAM 1GB 333MHz PC2700 DDR Desktop Memory (KVR333/1GR). Two days after the return policy expired, one of the boards ended being defective, causing my computer to freeze and to display horizontal lines on screen.I do not recommend this supplier unless you can obtain a longer warranty period."
5,Ram great,Fraction of price a Best Buy or anywhere else. Arrived sooner than promised and works great!
5,Rare Laserdiscs - dvds Movies Collector.,"Kabhi Kabhie's one of Amitabh Bachchan'a greatest movies,I have it on dvd from YASH CHOPRA COLLECTION.Special Feature includes Exclusive interview with Yash Chopra,English Subtitles,Digitally remastered from The Original Film,5.1 Audio,,Very great Movie :P"
3,Okay,The car seat still moves as much after putting this on...ok my the actual seat below is taking a bit of less beating
4,Good product and good value,Does what is expected. Keeps baby's feet off the seat back and helps to keep car seat from sliding in front.Only nice addition would have been velcro instead of slider on thing that holds it onto headrest above. As this is when I move it from one car to another I have to remove headrest as easiest way to remove install.Purchasers note that this one is smaller than many on market and does not have storage. For me perfect- exactly what I wanted.
2,Not the greatest,Need a better way to attach it to the car. I think it is going to break in a few weeks because of the tension. But only time will tell.
4,Good seat cover for the price.,"I bought this seat cover 2 months ago. I have a Chevy Silverado Crew Cab and it covered the whole seat, and had extra cover which I had to fold over the back of the seat. I feel confident that it will protect my car, as the material is thick."
3,Stuck to the leather,My only complaint is that it stuck to the leather of my car and has been pretty difficult to remove. I would suggest putting a small blanket under it so it wont stick to the leather seats!
5,Awesome learning tool that is fun!!!,My boys both loved these games!! This is an awesome way to get kids to learn and have fun at the same time!! I would highly reccomend this to anyone with children!!
3,Disappointing purchase.,"First, the photo should be changed since you cannot purchase a yellow dustpan. I had accidentally tossed my favorite dustpan in the dumpster. I quickly ordered this one from Amazon.com. I knew it was going to be gray but it was cheap at least. Well, that is what I got--a cheap dustpan that is bowed downward along the edge at the middle point to where your debris slides right under the pan! It will most likely go out in the trash next time on purpose! I am learning that a quick purchase is not necessarily a good purchase even on Amazon. So, I would advise spending more money and getting a better dustpan if you want to actually get up any debris when sweeping."
4,Nice wrenches,"I already had a metric set, so I needed the SAE set to match. These seem to be just as reliable as the metric set. They has the offset, which I like, and the reversible switch. The only thing I don't like about these wrenches is the style switch to reverse the mechanism. On the metric set I have, it is a switch you can easily flip with a finger without even looking. This switch kind of slides and is a little more cumbersome. All in all, I like them."
3,tastes like pudding,"The first time I made it,it tasted like pumpkin pudding. So the next time I reduced the milk buy a half cup and used one less Tb of butter. I also added whipped cream to half of the topping like on the box. Much better."
2,Dissapointed,I love Christian Birmingham art work but I wasn't very excited with the illustration in this book. I have seen better copies of the famous Night Before Chistmas poem.
5,The Night Before Christmas illustrated by Tasha Tudor,"I discovered this book 31 years ago, for my daughter and it is still loved by all the family. The illustrations are wonderful, warm, charming and delightful and bring a special meaning to the story. We still read it to all the young children on Christmas Eve and for adults we read the story and pass a grab bag gift every time the word THE is mentioned. It would not be Christmas without this book. It is magical."
4,quite good,"I learnt a lot from the book, but the vowel charts in the book are not shown in a clear manner."
1,In the weeds,"If your alter ego is Henry Higgins, or if you ARE Henry Higgins, this book is definitely for you. Excruciatingly detailed and technical discussions, all in phonetic terminology and notation, of niggly distinctions between various localized dialects' idiosyncracies and their various pronunciations. If you are, like the aforementioned Higgings (of ""My Fair Lady""), an ""expert dialectician and grammarian,"" buy this book and its predecessor; you'l find it fascinating (I think). If, however, you are a stage and voice actor looking for detailed guidance on affectingvarious authentic-sounding accents in order to better practice your craft, look elsewhere."
5,Good Sea Book!,"I have read many books about life on the sea in the age of square sail wooden ships and you'll enjoy this one if you like reading this kind of literature. It seems as though I always learn something new about life in that time and Poolman provides this education along with an incredible tale about the Speedwell voyage. He describes the characters and the events based on actual writings which are well footnoted. His glossary of the nautical terms relative to this story was a nice addition. How those sailors survived the many hardships and sea battles was amazing. Of particular interest is the insight Poolman gives into the many real life characters, the mutinies, the privateering contracts of the day and the international politics of the times."
2,"Decent costume prop, but not very durable","Ordered these boots for a Jedi Halloween costume, and for what it's worth, they look great. They are not that comfortable, and they're pretty big on me, as I'm a size 10 and they're more of an 11. But all of that was expected, and with some added padding and gel insoles, they worked out pretty well.The issue here is that the quality is very poor. After their second night out, the sole of one boot became almost completely detached and had to be glued back on. The imitation leather is also beginning to show small cracks in a few places. They served their purpose for Halloween, but unfortunately it looks like I won't be able to reuse them much in the future."
5,Works Perfectly!,"Used to replace a M48T86PC1 on a Bridgeport EZ-Track motherboard. MB had a socket, so replacement was a breeze. Started up and ran great. The vendor shipped the product well protected and in a timely manner. Couldn't ask for a better experience."
5,a perfect guidebook for the people interested in adult edu.,It helpes the reader understand and interpret the society that she/he lives in and social inequalities between the high-status and the oppressed. I really agree that when you communicate and talk with people you can find and learn lots of things from them.Ireally appreciate this book and thanks to freire for this practiceable book.
1,A Marxist Primer?,"Freire, or more accurately those in this country who advocate this book, would have us believe that there is some significant connection between illiterate Brazilian peasants of the 1960s and 21st century Americans. ""Farfetched"" is inadequate to describe this false analogy. Freire's Marxist agenda has failed historically and is intellectually bankrupt, yet today's zealots refuse to give up the fight to reduce us all to the same pathetic level of struggling mediocrity. Marxism is dead. Let's leave Freire and other such fellow travelers behind and move on."
4,NIce feeder but ...,"I loved this feeder, at first. I had thought it would keep squirrels away but they love to hang on it upside and eat to the heart's content. I have to fill it daily, not a big deal, but i got it for birds, not squirrels. they climb over all sorts of baffles to get to it and if i put it far away they jump incredible distances. They say add red cayenne and the squirrels stay away. I think it attracts them LOL ..."
4,No Depression Fans Take Note!,"All of you alt.country/no depression fans take note. This album is one of the seminal moments of the genre. While Bands like Uncle Tupelo/Wilco/Son Volt, Whiskeytown, et al. name check Gram Parsons (and rightfully so!), I bet this Willie Nelson offering was in heavy rotation when they were cutting their musical teeth.It is a work of spare beauty and captures the loneliness and heartache that comes with life. ""Blue Eyes Cryin' In The Rain"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. The extra tracks do not really add anything to the experience but they don't detract from it either.If you have not heard this music, yous should. Soon."
5,great CD,"I bought this for my husband's grandfather who's been a fan of Willie since the beginning. He used to own this album on vinyl and on cassette tape, so he wanted it on CD since he doesn't have a record player or casset tape player anymore. He reckons this is Willie's best album."
5,the best in the series so far,"or at least from what I have... there are no disappointing tracks in this one. Love coming back to it every once in a while. Leaving, 5am and Sertao Blues are my favourites. Enjoy!"
2,a few problems,"The whole puzzle was a bit warped and pieces wouldn't lay flat. Nowhere on this puzzle does it say ""Italy""--not the best editors on this project. I've bought a few of other continents, and had a piece missing on one of them, so I had to make one. Still, overall I like them for my 4 y.o.--the pieces are country-shaped and he's learning. Just wish they'd take a bit more pride in their product."
5,It works,My friend Kim has suffered from severe hay fever allergies since she was 9. She has tried countless remedies. Some of which worked for a short time. Some not at all.She read about Sneezeze in a magazine & has been amazed at the results. Not only is it a natural product but it is amazing. It has stopped the sneezing and runny nose which she had suffered from for many years. She says a big thank you and will now enjoy the summer.
5,Furnace Fest 2002 DVD review,"Great dvd. Don't pass up watching Norma Jean in all their excellence. Andrew W.K. set rocks too. Sound Quality on the DVD are good, not great though. Lots of different camera angles as well for good viewing."
4,"Locals only, no tourists","Edward Lee tends to be...disgusting. Some of his books are worse than others for depravity and gore, but he is knownfor graphic depictions of sex and violence. And sometimes, that's just the ticket!If you are a newbie just starting to dip your big toe into the horror pool, Edward Lee is not the place to start.but if you have long since dove into the deep end, then don't miss this guy!Sometimes, I want the joy and hope of Dean Koontz. Sometimes, I want the beauty of Anne Rice. But sometimes, ina certain disturbing mood that we all occasionally get, only Edward Lee will fill the bill.Flesh Gothic is one of his best. I also recommend Monstrosity. And check out his homage to H.P. Lovecraft inthe Innswitch Horror. The first book I read by him was Ghouls, and that got me hooked and searching for all hisworks.Don't try Creekers or The House until you are ready to be really grossed out. But Edward Lee is a guiltypleasure not to be missed."
3,Pretty good but not very original,"I enjoyed this book, especially the first 3/4s of it. For all the talk of Lee's over the top gore and sexuality, it wasn't what I thought it would be. More sex than gore, but it sure wasn't as shocking as everyone says.The main downside to this book is that it is almost a carbon copy of Hell House, by Richard Matheson. In both books there is a haunted house, owned by an apparently deceased eccentric millionaire. The house was the site of a terrible massacre, with sexual overtones. So, a group of ""experts,"" psychics, and pseudoscientists go in to check it out. They experience some spooky stuff, and some overt sexuality. The books only diverge at the very end, when Lee's expalanation for what's going on is a little different than Matheson's. Short of the ending, they are essentially the same book. Lee's is a lot more graphic, Matheson's a lot more frightening."
3,Welcome to the Temple of Flesh,"In Florida there is a mansion of 66 rooms. It has had a long history of sexual depravity. Recently an orgy turned into a slaughter as guests were killed and dismembered in ritualistic fashion. Afterwards the owner was missing and presumed dead. Now his widow is sending a team of psychics and a writer into the house to determine just what happened.Very strong imagery is used to tie psychic and sexual ideas together. The characters delve into the darkness of the house while fighting rising lusts that seem to be fed by the house itself. A strange girl, a locked safe, disappearing bodies, abandoned cars, and more drive the plot forward to its horrible conclusion.Like many Edward Lee books, this one is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. The images of sex and violence are strong and far from vanilla mainstream. The plot was interesting as were the characters but it is definitely only for fans of Lee's style of brutal writing."
1,Nice Product but the odor is overwhelming,"Did not get a chance to test this out. I am not sure what they used to produce or package this thing but the toxic aroma is overwhelming. We had left it out for a few days hoping the smell would dissapate but it never did. It is a very foul, chemical aroma that permeates the room. I saw one other review mentioning the smell so I don't know if this only affects a few units or if others were able to get past the smell. We will be returning this and looking elsewhere."
4,Tri-rific results for a monopod,"This monopod is very easy to use, ok, how can you mess up a monopod! I have used the monopod for photo/hiking trips from Kansas to the mountains of Colorado. Very light, helps stabalize the camera in high winds and has provided me with the ability to take many very nice distance photos. I would not suggust using it for a hiking stick..it's just not durable enough, but to hold and stabilize your shots.. excellent!"
3,It was all right accept for the rape,"An Army of Angels is an extremly well writtenbook. After reading 22 books on Jehanne's life I can honestly say Pam, unlike many authors, revieldthe true St. Jehanne. Pam has not made Jehanne a perfect saint but has showen her flaws, like her quick temper and her self doubt.However, I find great fault with the rape scene. For me it was very unsettling. Yes, Jehanne was abused, hassled and had great heartache in prison, I do not doubt that. But rape? I do not think so. And while I think the rest of the book was well written I must protest against this scene. Some people may say I am being picky, and maybe for them I am. But that is ok.I close with words I believed Pam left out of her book.""Alas! Am I so horribly and cruelly used, that my clean body NEVER yet defiled, must this day be burnt and turned to ashes!"""
5,Excellent product,This potty works well for us. My 2 year old daughter likes it so much that I bought her another one for her grandparents house.
3,Too Cute All In One,"I purchased this potty for my 1st granddaughter who lives in New Jersey, wishing she was a little closer to me, cause I'm hoping my son starts the task now. She's 21months walking, talking, fussing, and running to me that means POTTY TIME. I'm an Old Schooler, my boys were trained before they reached 15months potty & no more bottles. Now I pray!"
5,GREAT product,This is perfect for my 20 month old and I love that it will grow with her as she grows = great product and great price
5,Bought 2!,"This is a great little potty! I bought two of them so that my daughter and I, (I'm the nana of the soon to be potty trainer) could each have one at our homes. I think it will be easier for my grand daughter to potty train if she is able to use the same potty at different places she goes to. Could not beat it for the value! Love the pretty pink too! Great product overall!"
4,Good product.,The item came as advertised. It is made well and it's good quality. It worked out fine. Now we just have to get our little one to st on it and everything will work out nicely.
2,Not a very good CD...,"I have been a Take 5 fan since I purchased their first U.S. single ""I Give"". That single was GREAT. I have tosay that I really expected so much more of a group with such great potential. They seemed to have a more decent look with the release of their first single, which was a really nice song. This song has several sexual tie-ins which really make the song pretty annoying. It sounds like some of the other songs out there, but I gave it two stars cuz it was a pretty catchy song. I don't want to offend the group in any way, cuz I like them, they sing well. I just think that any other girl my age wouldn't want to listen to what seems like a sex-themed song."
2,No connections between these programs...no point buying together,"I got this bundle to check it out, since it was a little bit cheaper than what most folks recommend (the Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements bundle.)I was disappointed -- these two applications are just thrown together into the box. There aren't any connections between the programs, so there's really no benefit to buying this in a bundle.Worse, the Pinnacle software crashed repeatedly while working on a simple project.I don't know what Microsoft was thinking here. This is not their usual clean and stable software."
4,school,bought for school--for daughter. I can only say that the service and price were good. I bought it as a gift for my daughter
4,Good times!,"The Sims 2: Nightlife expansion pack seamlessly integrates features from Sims 2 and Sims 2: University, and adds fun new features as well. Sims can now purchase a car, as sims out on dates and drive to various downtown lots. Added features like the new ""pleasure"" aspiration and turn ons make this game more realistic than the rest. All in all, I'd say this is the best expansion pack yet."
5,the best expansion yet!,"Fans have been wanting cars for 5 years now!!! If your a sims fan then get this expansion cause youll love it! Its got night clubs,vampires,new houses in downtown area,dining,dating,group fun, also some new furniture,new clothes, new hairdo's,cars(i love the cars cause now you can take the kids to school and take yourself to work or to downtown. This expansion is worth it! You will have a blast playing it!"
4,Nightlife's the life,"The Sims 2 Nightlife adds new features to the Sims 2 game that expand your play experience significantly. Sims get their own cars, there is a 'downtown' section to neighborhoods, and new sim races to experience. Well worth it!"
5,Great Expansion pack-worth every penny!!,I love this expansion pack. Will Wright outdid himself with this one. They just keep getting better and better. I love how The Sims can now drive cars(hated waiting for that pesky taxi cab). It makes the game so much better.
4,Crazy Sims go Downtown,"This is a fun addition to the Sims 2. I played the Sims original and was loooking forward to the Sims 2. I found it a bit lacking - they are definitely milking the expansion franchise. Not much came with the original and each expansion has added things that might have been better off included with the Sims 2 at the start. Having a car is worthwhile, and long awaited. The Nightlife is amusing, with karaoke and bowling. The new social interactions are also nifty. There are some AI glitches, and the game is a memory hog. But definitely worth it if you love your Sims."
5,"Joyce shares how we can live in peace, above frustrations.","This book was life-changing! It showed me that God's grace is sufficient to cover my mistakes. I found that I can live a fulfilled life, without wallowing in frustration and stress!"
5,Take note of how many reviews are FIVE star,"This band is amazing. I caught the end of their live set - by accident - arriving to see the Neville Bros at a free festival in Detroit. WOW! I bought their latest studio release and was very impressed. Then, I found out about the Live at Fillmore disk and I'm nuts about it. The CD version has been worn out in my car and the DVD is being passed arround to turn others on to this fantasic band. They somehow make their gumbo of latin, rock and hip-hop sound like it was easy."
5,Ghost Encounters: The Queen Mary,any thing done by Peter James is just so great I found this to be really great love all his work
2,Eh.,"If you're thinking of buying this DVD, I have to warn you that it's short and nothing much happens. Peter James(r.i.p.) is sort- of your psychic tour guide, and while you get a short tour of the haunted ""hot spots"" of the ship, and there are some pretty impressive sounds, overall I don't think I could recommend it unless you're really hard up for some ghosty stuff to watch. Just not enough going on."
2,OPI Silver Crackel,When OPI came out with another color if the crackel I was thrilled. The Black crakel was awesome and I always had people asking about it. I have tried the silver twice and it just does not work as well. The colors and effect is not as eye catching and it really does not look right. I would not recommend it.
4,I tried it and i liked it,So when i first purchased this i did so without reading any reviews. then after i had already completed the payment i read some reviews and they all seemed to be pretty bad. but i have to say i received it today and tried it right away and i was pleased with the results. it shatters just fine and you can tell it's kind of a pettern not just random. it's dark enough where you can tell it's a sparkly silver but light enough to ba able to see the color underneath (i used fuchsia) so all in all it's a pretty good product!
3,looks good,This wisk looks good displayed with the rest of my kitchen aid products in my kitchen but it is really to large for what I wanted.
3,Nature Sounds Alarm,"The alarm is complex to set as are the nature sounds. It would be nice to have a progressive volume increase over a few minutes. This one is just like every other alarm, it just starts to blare out noise."
3,Avoid this clock!,"Gave as a gift, and recipient had trouble programming it, said that it would go off in the middle of the night, for no reason that he could figure out."
2,Time setting is SLOOOOW,"It takes way too long to set the time and alarms. You need to hold down the Forward button forever! If you change your wake-up time frequently, you will waste many minutes of each day holding down the damn forward button to get to the appropriate hour.I recieved this alarm clock in the mail today, and am returning it tomorrow."
1,Very frustrating!,"I purchased this item when my old clock radio died and Timex was the only version available (on that day). It is the most frustrating clock radio I have ever dealt with. I cannot find the owner's manual, and cannot turn off the alarm short of unplugging it and removing it's battery. It is definitely not user friendly!"
1,THE WORSE ALARM CLOCK THAT I HAVE PURCHASED,I bought this alarm clock last year. It is very difficult to use. I had to take off the top cover of this clock inorder to change the time. It should not be that difficult to change the time on an alarm clock. It is a waste of money.
3,Short life span,"I got this alarm for its compact style,the MP3 jack and the nature sounds. It is a bit complicated to operate but if you hang on to the directions for reference it will work. My biggest rub is the nature sounds quit working after a couple of years, I was then left with the beep alarm that has now died. For the price you would think it would last more than 3 years."
1,broken,"I got this as a present a few years ago, and I loved it. I used it for about a month and it completely died on me. I brought it back to the store where it was purchased and they unhappily gave me a new one. I have had this one for a year or two and now just a few weeks ago this one also stopped working. The time is still displayed but I cant use the alarm, cd player, sounds, or radio. I really liked it, but I dont think I will be getting anything from Timex in the future."
2,CD Sucks,Nature sounds are fairly decent. AM radio does not like florescent (sp) lighting. FM gets good reception while the clock and alarm combo are adequate. Give up on the CD feature. A fly walking across your ceiling will cause the CD to skip. Spend your money elsewhere.
4,Excellent with minor qualifications,"I wanted an alarm clock that I could set the time and ""reset"" the alarm each morning and it would be ready for the next day - including skipping Saturday and Sunday. This works great for that. The alarm can be a buzzer, the radio, or nature sounds. Each alarm (buzzer, radio, nature sounds)can be set for Mon - Fri, Sat & Sun, or every day of the week. However, it is not possible to set different times Mon - Fri and Sat/Sun on one sound. For example, I have the buzzer set for Mon - Fri at 6:00 AM. However, on the weekends I like to get up at 7:30. I cannot set an additional buzzer for the weekends, so I set the radio for the weekends. You can't set one alarm for Mon - Fri and then set the same alarm with a different time for Sat and Sun, a feature I had with a previous 7/5/2 alarm.I've only had this for less than a month, so I can't comment on the quality. However, if this clock is anything like their watches, I can expect to use this for many years to come!"
2,Interesting but not riveting,What I probably enjoyed most about this book was learning about the early part of Murray's life. I was amazed that he served in World War II and how success he was in his advertising career before Formula 1.I found much of the story after this a little repetitive and hap-hazard in way that it was presented. I also felt it was also drawn out in many ways which was disappointing. The information about the growth in popularity and the behind the scenes of Formula 1 was certainly of interest to me being fan but as I said a little drawn out.If you are a fan of Murray and are interested in how he came to be the voice of Formula 1 then I'd recommend you have a read. If you are looking for an insiders look at one of the biggest sports in the world I'd suggest another book maybe more appealing.
5,Well worth the Price,This style of book made studying less painful. My 16 year old daughter was able to read it and understand the concepts easier than the dry style of other SAT books. She improved her score 300 points from her practice test after reading it. We are very pleased that this book was recommended to her.
1,"Waste of money, time and paper","This book is useless. The online documents are so much easier to download and read on a laptop as well as search with your fav editor (emacs?). Anyway, why having bother to publish such a dull book without any added value is beyond me (and the rest of the review gang apparently.)Do yourself a big favor and make this book a big pass. If curious about XML metadata, get Inside XML instead.We are missing a ZERO star rating on Amazon. Too bad, because this book deserves it."
4,"Nice, comprehensive look on the beginnings of Miss Saigon","This video provides a glimpse of how Miss Saigon began and became one of the most popular musicals of all time. I found the auditions for Kim to be the most interesting part of the video. What an ordeal but what a success when they found Lea Salonga and Monique Wilson. Wished the video was longer but other than the length, I really can't complain that much:) A must-have for avid Miss Saigon fans out there."
5,Wonderful but check for defects,"If you are busy like I am, perhaps occasionally you don't rush a newly purchased DVD into the player when you first get it. Both copies of this DVD failed to play properly on my Dell desktop although they played well on my laptop and the TV/DVD with some minor skips at start up. A copy I bought over a year ago and gave away did not have any defects. Its a wonderful musical and story. Buy, enjoy, but check it when you first get it befor the trial time lapses."
4,"Good, but could've been better","It was informative, and a good mix of scenes from the show and behind the scenes footage, but the tryouts lasted for ever and ever! I still reccomend it, though."
1,Wireless Camera,"Tried the system and was just OK then moved onto the Uniden system, far superior, no video noise. Do not get this one, Uniden at the same price is far superior and a higher frequency band for much better pictures/video."
2,Not a good idea,"The battery configuration makes this toy a puzzling endeavor. I don't think the toy is build to last, and mine didn't last a month."
1,SELLER SHIPPED REMANUFACTURED CARTRIDGE IN LIEU OF ORIGINAL HP CARTRIDGE AS ADVERTISED,PRODUCT ADVERTISED AS ORIGINAL HP LASERJET CARTRIDGE IN RETAIL PACKAGING.RECEIVED REMANUFACTURED CARTRIDGE AS A SUBSTITUTE. NOT HAPPY.
1,Hp1320 laser cartridge,"I do a fair amount of printing and desktop publishing. I've used the cartridge for about a month now. The print quality itself has been fine, but 3 times I've had to clean the roller (or platen or whatever it's called) because of a dark streak down the left side of the page."
5,100% satisfied!,"No problems with this toner cartridge. Delivered promptly. The cartridge is working as expected in my HP Laser Jet 1320 printer. So far, I am 100% satisfied."
5,Awesome toner cartridge,Awesome! This cartridge is every bit as efficient as the HP cartridge at less than 1/4 the price. I will continue to order my replacements at Amazon Inkers.
4,"I stand, My stuggle","This writing is indeed a meaty morsel to digest. Although it does offer insight into the struggles with a dominate male religious bureaucracy in desiring change that encompasses new and old religious issues for equality and recognition. As a woman, I did enjoy reading this this, and now I know!"
5,Great C.D.!!!!!,I am totally in Love with this C.D.!!!!!! It is my favorite. The music is great and it definatly makes for great party music. I definatly recommend buying it if you are into the techo type music.
2,A Disappointing Purchase,"The cards and book that come with this are nice, but the credit card-sized flashlight is so flimsy and breaks so easily that it's not worth the money. My 7-year-old daughter recently purchased this book with her own money at a national park book store. The flashlight immediately broke, so she exchanged it for a second one. It didn't work either, but we didn't discover this 'til we'd already left the park and couldn't return it. My daughter was extremely disappointed and wished she purchased a different book with her hard-earned money."
3,"It was a good book, but not excellent.","I really anticipating on reading this book. I've been playing Magic for about a year and a half and I love the game, as do I Tempest and it's expansions. There is one thing I really hated about this book. It was the way they told it. It was first person under each individual's chapter. That was nice and all. I hated the darn librarian and the kid. I could care less about those two. I would be reading the book then all of a sudden, back to the librarian. I just really disliked that. Well, overall it was a pretty good book. I think they should of had the whole book by Gerrard's point of view, or just without the librarian. Overall, if you are a Magic player I would read it, even it you aren't one, give it a try, it is pretty good."
4,It's a good childrens Book,"I think this is a heart filling fairytale book about true love. There is also a very important lesson in this book, but you have to get to the end to find out. But somehow there are lots of mistakes. Get this book and you won't regret!!"
1,Waste of Money,I was bitterly disappointed when I got this CD. I have the original LP and looked forward to hearing Anton Karas's wonderful music in a pristine recording. Imagine my dismay when it merely turned out to be audio tracks from the movie. Soundtracks that contain dialogue are usually marked as such. As this was not the case with this CD I consider it deceptive packaging. Hopefully the REAL soundtrack will someday be made available.
4,there's no such place as far away,"Whidbey Island WA book store had the book to me in North Carolina in short order, so I guess it's true that ""There's no such plae as far away."" Book was in very good shape as advertized and a great price. It was soon on its way to South Africa to a Birdingpal. The other copy arrived shrtly thereafter, so I'm a very satisfied customer. Thanks for your good service."
1,the only thing that was far away was my enthusiasm,Cannot complain over what this booklet cost;I bought it used....but the title says it all and the story line is purely for kids to grope with. It could have contained a post script collection of popular or Buddhist or Taoist comments for the big folks who would read this to little folks at bedtime maybe making this brochure/booklet story more worthwhile.
1,No help fom Amindarov,"I can't find anything helpful in this dictionary, not a single word that I could use. It may be either too ""dialectically restricted"", or just poor. About Kurmanci dictionaries, I still prefer Rizgar's book.."
2,"IF THEY INVENTED THIS,THEN THIS ISN'T MUCH TO BRAG ABOUT","OK,I'll give Diddy his props,he did RE-INVENT the remix but thisscatterdash remix compliation isn't the correct display for Diddy's superior remixes.Some of the hot ones on here are ""Special Delivery"" and ""You Gets No Love"" but the [bad] Ashanti remix along with the listless ones that Diddy re-crafted in latter years don't amount to much.As do the dry,sleepy mixes of ""I Need A Girl"".Where are all the classic Mary J. mixes?For Pete's sake,where are all the B.I.G. remixes!! Craig Mack? Total's ""No one Else"" mix? Come on now,Diddy,a guy with an ego as a big as yours should've known better!!!"
1,This cds straight dumb,"Man this is just a buncha old diddy songs wit new background music and new artists, sounds the same as all the original songs. Nothing great they just threw this together in probably an hour. I wouldn't suggest it."
4,"Magickal, Adventurous....but needed Somthing More","After reading Mysts of Avalon I fell in love with Marion Zimmer Bradley's writing. It was the best book I have ever read, The Forest House was well written. The plot was strong and the characters had the same life and relatablity as the characters in Mysts however, The Forest House left me hanging. I think it lacked the completeness of Mysts. The end came at you rather too quickly and I think it could have been better explained. Perhaps it's just after seeing the masterpeice every other worke seams dimmed, but I think The Forest House was not as good as it could have been."
1,All I can say is ZZZzzzzzZZZZzzzz,"Last year I picked this book for my outside reading in my Honors English 3 class. Now I ask myself why.....this got to be one of the most boring book I've ever read, and I hated the ending. I don't remember much about the book now except the fact that I'll never read it again. Right now the book is sitting in my ""closet of rejected objects"" collecting dust. Anyone want to take it off my hands? FYI I did not read Mist of Avalon before reading this book and I'm sure that I never will(base on the reactions from classmates who read that as the outside reading)."
2,Not nearly as good as Mists,"I'm rather dissapointed in MZB. True, I could never expect to read a book again that evokes the same feelings as Mists, but TFH was even worse than ""not as good as TMOH"". Bradley's characters are dull and lifeless, and the plot was a barely strung together excuse to show off all of Bradley's research. Still, even though it is below Bradley's usual standards, it's better than a lot of books that manage to get published. So go ahead and read it, if it's raining and you have nothing better to do. Just don't expect much."
1,Even Corel doesn't use Corel,"A story in an Ottawa newspaper (the Citizen, I believe) recently ran a story that revealed that Corel used Adobe Illustrator to design the packaging for Corel Graphics Suite. And no wonder. The Corel suite is just plain painful to use. A clunky interface, super slow re-draw time and truly wacky text handling make the Corel experience a truly frustrating one. So I, like Corel, will continue to use Adobe."
4,Works great; wish it had a latch,"This storage box is plenty big and keeps everything nice and dry. My husband said it was easy to set up. It also provides extra informal seating. The only complaint is that I wish it had a latch. It's not a huge priority, but I am going to rig something up before long. If you live in a windy area, get a different storage box unless you can put a brick on the lid or think you can rig up a latch. Otherwise, this thing is great."
2,One of the worst buys ever,"Works OK as a copier.Printer gives error messages periodically, but scanner would only work right after reinstalling the drivers... no matter how cheap you can get it ,it's a waste of money...."
5,So great!!!,"Even though I kind of guessed the ending before long, I actually cried at the end...Read it, love it, think about it..."
5,Makes you think and gives you a little chill,"This book is an excellent read. Palmer writes three simultaneous stories at the same time that unite for the climactic finish. By now, all review readers know the story is about the illegal trafficking of human organs. The difference is how Palmer has developed the means by which the samples are taken, tested and the determination made regarding the organ allocation giving the reader the feeling that this can happen (or may already be happening) in our everyday world. This book is an excellent page turner from the very beginning easy flowing with a 'cut to the chase' story telling style. This book is worth it simply because it makes you think."
2,Uninteresting,"I appreciate that these fellas appreciate the blues, but it's all too obvious that these boys is fakin' it. It didn't help that when I saw them play at Satyricon in Portland, that they had no nuance what-so-ever. The drummer just played as loud as he could the whole time. He said absolutely nothin' by doin' so. I was impressed by the harmonica playing, but I was not sold by this band in the least. If it's guitar drums and vocals that you're after (no bass guitar), then get yourself ahold of Elmo Williams and Hezekiah Early's CD called Takes One To Know One. The Flat Duo Jets' first few LP's are also incredible and worth finding although they is outta print (self-titled and Go Go Harlem Baby). Their in-print stuff is pretty good too, though. The first single and LP by The Gossip are also really great, too. Don't forget about the two-guitar and drums attack of Hound Dog Taylor and his Houserockers. These Soledad boys cover their Give Me Back My Wig, but the original is so much better."
1,digital concepts from amazon,"I had ordered a 1300 mah battery from Amazon before and it was delivered as ordered so I later repeated the order. This time Amazon sent me a 1200 mah bettery, which is an O.K. battery but of lower specifications and should have been priced less than the 1300 mah battery (IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE PACKAGE IT WAS A 1200 mah BETTERY). I welcome the opportunity to inform Amazon that they, too, are quilty of a little false advertising. At the very least amazon could have informed me of the switcheroo, if not adjusted the price for the inferior product or asked me for my permission. I just didn't think the thing was worth my sending it back!!!"
5,very clear instructions and beautiful work made easy,The book is wonderful. The authors instructions are clear. While a couple of the patterns look like one offs really these are very well written and done.
2,Awful,The character is very cold and story is outdated. Not worth the purchase. Dont waste your money. Content was lacking.
1,My 6 year old was very disappointed,"Another disappointing Christmas gift this year, 2005. My 6 year old found it boring and hard to follow. I told her to forget about the video and we will just make up our on ballet moves. So I think that helped a little. But I would not waist your money."
4,Good stuff.,"Well I just wrote a review slamming their second album, so I thought I'd weigh in on this one. I really like this album, though its lifespan is not going to be more then a few years. It's good though, and it's energetic, and it's heartfelt. Personally, I can really feel the emotion of the songs, especially when I'm drumming to them. I play bass and drums, and really dig their drummer. I mean he's not revolutionary but he's really tight and holds things together really well, especially with some longer fills, which he nails. I like""Spending Time"" the best. Also, the song style/arrangement/structure varies more on this album then their second.I listen to MxPx, Relient K, even some Underoath and Avenged Sevenfold, and I like these guys and recommend you buy this album. As for their second...eh go read my review"
1,"the worst movie of the year, or at least the most boring.","this movie absolutely blows,what was matt damon thinking,better yet what was billy bob thorton smoking.this movie will put you to sleep if you suffer from insomnia,i highly reccomend avoiding this film."
2,Stars only for locations and Damon & Thomas,"The locations and scenery are great, and so are Henry Thomas and Matt Damon.The rest of the movie is a snoozer, especially in the last 45 minutes. Damon and Cruz have no chemistry, and there is no justification for their characters falling in love. It also is not clear as to why the woman's father sends the two Americans to jail for a while and then gets them out. The ending is a real letdown, and the overall pacing is much slower than necessary in many segments.I am sure the book is far superior."
4,Surprisingly Authentic,"Given how disappointingly liberal, preachy, trite and predictable so many of Hollywood's dramas are, this film presents both tremendous moral balance and a wonderful ease of presentation, all the while offering up one surprise after another. It's as if this film was shot nearly at the time it was to have happened; so clean, real, and spare is the spiritual atmosphere surrounding the characters. Whether the lead characters' authentic, highly believable progress through the story, a simply fantastic performance by young Lucas Black, or the spot-on cameo by a very able Bruce Dern, this film exposes Western sensibilities (even in the mid 20th century) to perfection - Billy Bob Thornton deserves credit for making a beautiful sleeper of a film far too realistic, too believable, and too traditional to ever win a second glance from the Hollywood crowd. See it, and if you're like me, own it for it's simply riveting social and historical placement."
3,Losing and winning.,"A unique story about loss in the American Southwest.The immigration template is run in reverse. The oft-told narrative is of Hispanics coming to America for a better life that comes with its share of culture shocks. But author Cormac McCarthy's ""All The Pretty Horses"" has poor Texans crossing into Mexico for a bumpy ride with a wealthy family south of the border. (Yes, Virginia, there are rich Mexicans).Matt Damon does OK in the lead. Henry Thomas (""E.T.'s"" friend Elliott all grown up) is strong in a supporting role. Penelope Cruz, playing Damon's love interest, is barely audible but that adds to her mystery.Nicely shot and edited movie. Neat meditation on the age-old truism that love always involves losing. Yet loss clears the dross, connecting us better with our essential selves. Recommended."
1,All the SLEEPING horses,"Wow! I was reading other Amazon reviews and it's difficult to believe this movie could be that bad. I've just rented it. This one is that bad. Billy Bob said he was making a film in the old style of filmmaking. I love that style.. and folks.. this isn't it! This film is just slow, snail paced story telling. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas are good in this, but their acting can't save it. The romance between Damon and Cruz is flat and not convincing. The use of slow motion and black fade outs at the end of scenes is done poorly and is annoying throughout. This is a real disappointment. A real snoozer!"
4,Fun for pre-readers and readers,"My daughter (2) and son (4) both love to look at this book. The pictures of all the different hugs are warm and friendly. My daughter in particular keeps pulling this book and the other ""God"" books in the series off the shelf. My son is just starting to recognize words and loves the repetition of familiar words. This is my favorite book of the series!"
3,The Keys To Tulsa,"The movie is good with superb/stunning - to say the least- acting of Joanna Going. James Spader is - well, ""OK"". It is just great to see James Coburn again, and the musical score is fine. The movie in itself is based on a script - which surprises me, it could have been a sponaneous home movie someone made during a weekend - that is poor or even worse. At best, this film is amusing as long as you can push ""forward"" most of the time. The performances mentioned above are well worth the buck, though."
1,Not a good buy at all,"I bought this movie because I collect movies with Cameron Diaz and I can say it was disapointing. She appears during one minute at the beginning and never again!I didn't find any interest in the story, and I was yawning all the time. How boring can this be?"
2,"Can you say ""False Advertising""?","The cover and the description say ""sexy comedy"". It is not. It is about a mentally-ill woman. There's nothing funny or sexy about it. The producers obviously realized they made an unsellable movie and resorted to false advertising to sell it."
2,Not the real deal,"Firstly I am commonly known as a slade nutter having grown up listening to them since ny early teens bak theearly seventies.they have been a major influence on my life especially in music. In the eighties i was impressed with wot the states were doing in heavy metal and the obvious influence this band had onthose hairy rockers particulary quiet riot ,wasp,and excellent vocalists like rhett forrester and brian volmer to name two. Slade were awesome in concert but never truly delivered on vinyl due to severe gigging schedules and poor management decisions and never was that more evident than here. I cant call it dross being a fan but i wish to Nod this album would vaporize. Check out the real deal Whatever happened to slade,slade alive, or watch em live on you tube but dont waste bucks onthis weak platter. Slade made some awesome music but this dreadful cd is the pits."
2,"Hopelessly, hopelessly outdated.",The Java world has passed this book by. Black Art is based ona completely outdated version of Java. It amazes me that thisbook is even still on the shelves. I am a professional Javadeveloper and I simply cannot recommend a book that relies onobsolete technology like this.
4,Good for an introduction to Java game programming,"This book was generally very good. It suffers in that it is very old for a programming book and uses a lot of deprecated Java API. It also barely touches on some essential topics such as MediaTracker (for example, how do you implement a load bar for your game?) which is important for most games which will be played over the Internet. But it does have some very useful sections and will hand-hold you through building a 2D game. It also discusses how to build multi-player Java game applets, a topic I haven't seen discussed anywhere else. If you are new to game programming or game programming in Java, this book is an excellent source of information."
1,Worst DVD Ever purchased,"This was the very worst DVD that I have ever purchased. The technical quality was so bad that Fisher's features were unrecognizable. Musical tone production was simply atrocious. I could go on and on but really do not feel like wasting any more time on this piece of crap. Why does Amazon even put something this bad on the market for sale? I would really, really like my $$$ back, Amazon. Your faithful customers deserve far, far better from you. The back of the DVD cover says it all: ""THIS DVD IS NOT ENDORSED BY EDDIE FISHER."" Only five copies left?? If you have any mercy on your customers and you care about preserving your reputation as a reputable dealer of halfway marketable products, you will withdraw them immediately. To sell something this horrible is, in my opinion, disreputable and a disgrace to your reputation."
1,I wouldn't recommend this,"This album has no point whatsoever. Just another attempt for the Diplomats to get money. Get Cam'ron ""Killa Season"" because it is much better than this. Anyone who has seen the ""Knick Knack"" video realizes how much Purple City sucks. This album has one good song. Just download ""Hustlers"" featuring Jim Jones and B.G.; do not bother with the rest of the album."
5,I am very confused about the availability of this series,"[...]All 115 Uncut Episodes 6 Seasons on 8 DVDSExcellent video and audio quality100% in chronological orderCommercial free and uneditedThis box set contains all 8 DVDs with Custom Artwork.These DVDs are region free so they will play on any DVD player Worldwide and DVD-Rom, X-Box or PS2 worldwide.These are brand new, in stock and ready to ship.Are these real, can I buy this series on DVD or is this a scam?"
2,WONDER YEARS,"I wish the producers would stop baiting us - what does it take an act of God before they decide to start releasing the ""Seasons"" of this great series. If they are reading this I can assure them that I will also buy ALL of the seasons when they are released. This brings back alot of memories but I want the whole seasons released. Kind of like eating one or two bites out of a great steak and looking at the rest of it and you're still starved!"
4,Very interesting book,"This is an easy read for those who love learning about various mystery schools. I'm not an initiate of any sort, but I do love learning and reading about various mysteries, philosophies, esoteric writings. If you're curious, go ahead and check out the book."
3,A Powerful Story,"To be completely honest, the only reaons that I read this book was because it was offered for free to Kindle owners and I had just purchased a Kindle. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I have recommended it to many of my friends. I am a religious person, although not a spiritual person (if that makes sense) but I was truly moved by this story - both by the fact that, by all accounts, Mr. Piper truly came back from the dead and by the struggles that he endured as he struggled to heal his body and his spirit. I did find the writing to be a bit choppy and repetitive, which is why I did not give it a better rating."
1,Truly dissapointing to the MAX.,"Wow, this was a gigantic dissapointment. The back cover and the inside of the book seem to be different altogether. Did not like this book."
3,Self Pity Much?,"The story was compelling, as other reviewers have stated. However, the author was arrogant and pretentious and I almost stopped reading the book several times. The only reason I didn't was because I just had to see if it got better somehow, and it did (somewhat) in the last two chapters. I believe Rev. Piper did experience a change in his perspective following the NDE, but not enough to make him tolerable, in my opinion. His negativity, his assumptions of what others ""must"" think, and his self isolation makes him a poor catalyst for this awesome message. I still don't think he gets it."
2,Just ok,I bought this book hoping to learn more about heaven. The parts about heaven were extremely brief and then the majority of the book is about the author's struggles after his accident. It was lengthy and detailed and at times depressing but overall an ok book.
3,Not enough about heaven,I was expecting more of the book to be about the actual heaven rather than events preceeding the arrival in heaven and the time return following the visit.
1,Heaven,"I really didn't care for this book at all. I thought it was too self-absorbed...talked more about the author's injuries and recovery (which is fine, he went through a lot and came out the other side, so it is inspirational in that way) and not much time was spent on the 90 minutes he supposedly spent in heaven."
1,Dull book,"Although the message of this book should have been inspirational, the writing was not. I kept waiting to be drawn into it, but it never happened. Poor writing, boring book."
5,Excellent book,"A truly inspiring book. This book shows God's grace as I've been taught from an early age. It shows that prayer does work. It also confirms that heaven IS waiting for all belivers. In earthly terms, can I prove this? No, and neither can Don Piper. But I know from faith and faith alone that these things are true. Don knows from personal experience that they are certainly true. What a great and glorious God we have!"
2,Simplistic,"Other than the description of the ""Heaven"" experience, this is a simplisticly written account of an extended recovery from very severe injuries from an auto accident. A lot of ""poor me"", followed by Christian testimonial. Some may find it interesting."
5,Fantastic book,"90 Minutes in Heaven is the best book I have ever read. Through his accident, we learn how to become stronger Christians, positive attitude and hopeful. Marvelous book. Can't say enough about it. I feel everyone should read it."
1,More whining than inspiring,While I believe the physical and emotional pain Piper went through was horrible. I can't say that I could endure it myself. The book was less about heaven than it was about how the universe revolves around himself.
1,there are much better books out there,"This book actually has little to say about heaven and a lot to say about his recovery from the accident that sent him there. There are much better books on heaven such as "" Close Encounters of The God Kind"", "" Within Heaven's Gates"", are the Grand Daddy of them all ""Paradise The Holy City and The Glory of the Throne"""
1,Give me a break,"If your brain is working, you are not dead. If it goes off and comes back more than 30 seconds later, you are a vegetable. I don't know which is more despicable, the guy who wrote the book or the publisher who bought it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DOG,"This book should have been titled 90 Seconds in Heaven. That's about the amount of time I spent reading anything interesting in this looser of a paperback. The author provides a lackluster, even boring picture of heaven in the opening pages. He provides none of the imagery typical of even the most basic NDE account. The remainder of the book is then focused on his recuperation from the accident and all the typical Christian miracle/God's Will pandering you would expect from a fundy. I think the whole episode was a delusion.Press the Back Button and get out of this book web page as fast as possible!!!"
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I heard this book was very inspirational. While the first couple of chapters were somewhat interesting, it wasn't a book I could even finish. The writing is VERY repetitive. If someone is interested, I'd recommend getting it from the library first - not worth buying."
5,Inspirational,This is a book you will never forget. It shows you how God is working in every area of our lives. This book will move you and you wont be able to stop reading it I read it in one day and couldn't put it down!!
3,talk more about heaven,"actually, I would have liked to read more about his experience in heaven than of his surgeries and pain, but it was good!"
3,I enjoyed reading his account of Heaven.,"So many factors were against him, it's a miracle he is here to tell us his story. However, he is here, and his account of what happened is in length about his recovery. The big difference is that, in the beginning, he tells you what happened to him in,(or I should say right outside)of heaven after he died. The rest of the story reveals his very real, very painful recovery, that took years and still he will never be the same...in anyway. Hearing about Heaven, is exciting. I think anyone would like this book, but especially someone who is afraid of death."
3,Unfinished Reading,"Three stars because I have not finished this book. I am a little skeptical about what I have read so far....will continue until I finish; but in the meantime, I am reading ""Heaven"" and enjoying it very much. It is much closer to what I want to believe heaven is really about because I'm just a new widow."
5,Thanks!,I ordered a book for my grandmother who does not live in the same area as I do. She is completely satisfied at the condition of the book that I purchased from this seller. Thank you very much.
5,An Intriguing story!,I ordered these as gifts because I had read it and it's an amazing and believeable story! I highly recommend it!
1,Did a narcissist write this book?,"This guy is so self absorbed! I certainly would not want to go through what he did, but a pastor with an ""all about me"" attitude left me with a bad taste in my mouth. His kids were ""shipped off"" to other homes for 6 months so that his wife could babysit him in the hospital until 10:30 every night. Really? Good Grief! If he cherishes his family it sure didn't come through in his writing. It seems that he thought higher of the people that prayed for him than his own family! He complained for most of the book and when he wasn't complaining he was glorifying himself with his good works (oh, and there was the minute or two of reading on his version of heaven). The only reason I finished the book was because I kept hoping that this guy would finally be humbled... didn't happen."
2,It's A Great Sell,"The book sells because it's a story we all desparately want to hear, to affirm our beliefs pertaining to immortality. To a degree, I enjoyed this borrowed book but couldn't help thinking about my own journey to ""Heaven"" which wasn't quite as dramatic and which would probably be scoffed at as a dream or side-effect from trauma, as neural waste, a process that ocurrs in the brain just before we lose all function or just as we regain it. We need to be careful of what others say, or, consider their reasons for publicizing and profiting from such a story. There are too many stories which too many people swallow wholesale as Absolute Truth."
1,Not so much about heaven...,"When I bought this book, I was expecting to hear rich details about what the author experienced while in heaven...After all, 90 minutes is a long time to be in heaven and you would think that's what the book would be about, but it's not...It's an inspiring book, with an inappropriate title.."
2,Depressing!!!!,"This book started out beautifully with a vivid discription of heaven, then it turns into a depressive and boring description of his recovery. I can t understand, how a pastor can be so negative. NOT a good read, was not at all what I was expecting. If you are interested in reading this book, do not spend your money, borrow it from someone."
1,Very Disappointed,"I thought this book would be about Heaven, but it's really about recovery after an auto accident. Author shows no emotion. Very boring book with much repetition."
3,New Title: My Recovery,I was a little disappointed that the book only discussed the topic of heaven in just 2 chapters while the book has a total of 18 chapters. The topic was really geared towards a man recovering from a terrible accident. I cant believe that spending 90 minutes in heaven yields only 2 short chapters. Though I am grateful Don has touched many lives regarding the matter.
1,Baloney,"More religious propaganda. I was pronounced DOA from an aortic aneurysm bursting. It was an hour and a half before I made it to the emergency room. All I saw ""while dead"" was a black void of nothingness. This guy halucinates to get a best seller. I should of thought of that scam."
1,Disappointing ... near fraud .... I want my $1 back !,I paid $1 to have this book shipped from our central city library to my local neighborhood library. I WANT MY $1 BACK !! Let's see .... a Baptist minister has a NDE experience which duplicates the story of heaven that Baptists and other evangelicals learn in 3rd grade Sunday School. Golden gates .... meet your long lost relatives .... I'm surprised that George Wallace wasn't there to meet him. I had hoped for something interesting and new and I get evangelical dogma. I STILL WANT MY $1 BACK !!
4,Good book to read!,"This one's a must read for everyone. His experience about heaven isn't as detailed or profound as others that i've read. But his recovery from the accident, & adjustments, depression struggles, and the accepting of a sorta ""new life"" with many limits, is very touching. It's once again, a good reminder to not take anything for granted!"
5,There's more in this book than you think,"A friend offered me this book and I was not especially interested - being somewhat skeptical of out-of-body ""revelations.""Whether you accept the author's experiences or not, the real value in the book, for me, was his honesty about the depression, pain, and learning, life-changing experiences of recovery. The author's honesty about struggling with not wanting to be here, not wanting to be around people, etc... was stark and refreshing. Even better, his slow journey out of himself, supported by his family and church, is a testimony to the healing value of a community of faith. This book has more to offer than it would seem on first glance. If you have no interest in people who have had glimpses of heaven, you still might want to take a look at this book for what it says about devasting loss, injury, brokenness and recover."
1,A disappointment!,"Truly a disappointment. I should have known better than to purchase this book. How can an entire book be written about a 90 minute experience? However, I did not expect a blow by blow of medical treatments and his healing process."
1,"Nice story, but no proof it is real","Don Piper is a pastor with a bias towards the supernatural. He experienced a horrific car accident which caused him to be declared clinically dead. What he perceived to be real during his state of unconsciousness can not be proven true or not true. The burden of proof is on those who make a positive claim. If Don Piper claims his experience is real, he has the burden of proof to provide physical and/or presentable evidence, if he expects others to believe him. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any proof but his own testimony and the hearsay of others. Since he, himself believes it to be true, I will not call him a liar. However, believing something to be true doesn't make it true. Scientific studies prove that the human brain can and often does hallucinate when oxygen deprived, it is reasonable to suspect that that is indeed what has happened."
1,Not Impressed,"Not only does Piper think very highly of himself, he also thinks very little of God's supreme sovreignty. Piper claims he was ""prayed back to life"". I'm sorry, but God is not subject to our requests. He does not change His mind based on our prayers. I cannot say whether Piper's account is true or false, but I can steadfastly say that God and His plan is much bigger than us and our perceptions of eternal anything."
5,Great Reading,I couldn't put this book down -- it tended to give more about his life after the 90 minutes in Heaven than the 90 minutes itself. Certainly a book that makes you think and be thankful. Also brings comfort and hope to those grieving. I'd recommend it's reading to anyone!
5,"Wonderful, Inspiring Book!","This book was recommended to me by a friend. I purchased it, and had it read within three nights. It was an inspiring, uplifting book that gave me hope and enhanced my faith about today's life issues. Having some health issues in my own life, I was awe-inspired by Rev. Piper's faith and his ability to cope with such pain and suffering and live to be such an inspiring witness to others through God's help, love, and strength. A very thought-provoking book and one that would be a great resource for others going through very difficult times in their lives. I carry certain principles in this book with me every day, and it has only enhanced my spirituality and my desire to be a better person."
1,Not my favorite,"Good story, but it is sporadic, and repetitive. It's hard to follow, and gets old after hearing the same thing five different ways."
3,A glympse at what God can do in a yielded life,"I enjoyed this book and have passed it on to others. There are a lot of books written about visits to Heaven that I question the validity but after completing this ""90 Minutes in Heaven"", I am convinced his experience was real. What he allowed God to do with his life afterwards and as a result of his horrendous suffering, he answered God's call on his life."
3,Interesting topic,"This is an interesting book. The title is misleading because only the first chapter or two speak to the experience of heaven. The rest is about his recovery from injury. It's still very interesting. Unfortuately it isn't well written. There is a lot of repetition. But beyond that, it's still an interesting book."
5,well written and believable,"I read this book on my beloved kindle in one sitting. My husband had a 'near death experience' when he flatlined 4 times in the ER, so I can relate and wholeheartedly believe Preacher Don's account of Heaven. But what I really liked was the fact that God does use us after accidents, something that God certainly didn't cause, but when bad things happen to us, He turns it around to bless us in many ways. The old statement what doesn't kill us will make us stronger is so true, especially in this book.By telling his story Preacher Don has no idea how many people will turn to God and actually make it to Heaven when their time comes. I believe God wants us all to live long and prosperous lives, but if something 'else' intervenes, we can take such comfort in knowing our real home is in Heaven with our loved ones and our most loving Father God."
1,Not Enlightening,Pretend your a baptist and write one chapter on a literal interpretation of what you've been told about heaven and you have this.
3,Not what I Expected,"The author revealed what he saw in heaven in the first part of the book, but 90% of the book discussed his ordeal after returning from heaven. Most of the book discussed the pain, frustration, and depression he experienced during his recovery. I craved to hear more of a description about heaven so for me, it was a bit disappointing."
4,90 minutes in heaven,A very telling book that talks about mans jourey to heaven. Which made me rethink my idea's anger in my life. This is a good read for the person that needs hope put back in their soul.
1,Glad He Got Good Look at Heaven,"I'm glad that ole Don got a good look at Heaven because he probably won't see it again ----- Such BS --Can't wait to see his next masterpiece, ""90ternity in Hell"""
2,90 Minutes in Heaven,"Don Piper went through/ and is still going through such an ordeal as witnessed in this book. He has clearly helped many, many good souls.However, I think the book should have carried a different title. I anticipated reading about his 90 minutes in heaven. His description of what happened when he died, only last a very short time into the book. The rest is about his great pain and struggle and depression, which I commend him for sharing, but I do think the title was misleading."
5,90 minutes in Heaven,I lived in the area talked about in this book. I drove on that particular bridge many times and it is an extremely dangerous one. When I acquired this book I immediately read front to cover in less than a couple of hours and was very much in awe of the writer's experience. I give 90 minutes in Heaven all stars!
4,"Good, but can get at any hardware store.","It's good stuff to use for cat scratching posts and cat trees, etc. It costs a little more to buy this online once shipping is figured in. Next time I would just buy this at any hardware store where it is readily available."
4,Beautiful!,I love this journal! The computer screen really doesn't do it justice. It lays flat when writing which makes it comfortable for me since I am left handed. I recently saw a paperblanks journal in a bookstore and thought it was beautiful but they were charging like $19 for one. I went online and found the same one for ~$10. Can't beat the great prices at Amazon.
2,"Well acted, but a waste of time. Sorry.","This held my interest until towards the end -- the dramatic high point. The acting is good, but I really felt at the end that I had just wasted my time. (I seldom feel that way about a film.) It is off-beat, and definitely amusing at times."
2,Academia meets bureaucracy,"This is not the book for you, if you are seeking a clear explanation of the HIPAA Security Rule and some helpful tips for implementing it in the real world. You would expect a book on HIPAA to clarify the baffling bureaucratic language of the original documents. However, Rada manages to obscure the subject matter further by heaping on academia and examples that don't quite hit the mark.To be fair, I have found a few helpful nuggets in the text. However, these nuggets were buried in hundreds of pages of extremely unpleasant language. The sort of stuff that makes you want to pour gasoline on yourself and light a cigarette, or at least work on some other important project. I would be grateful to anyone who would write a book that gets to the bottom line: what do I need to do in order to comply with the rules?"
4,"Good movie, but I recommend buy just the movie","The extras of the movies are ""whatever"", but the ""Toy Story"" story is fantastic. I recomend buy just the movie in case you are not interested in to see how do PIXARS make the effects that change the world."
2,DVD,"I thought I was buying a New DVD, it was used. It had a couple of scratches and was not compatible to play on my DVD player."
3,Scratched DVD,"My son was so excited to get this movie. He waited by the mailbox everyday to see if it had arrived, and when it did we watched it right away. It is scratched through almost the whole movie. We can still watch it, but we just have to sit there and watch it jump scenes on its own and hes very upset about it.Definitely not worth the money. I will never purchase a used DVD off Amazon again."
5,Gotta Love It,Did not have the movie Toy Story -so when the 10th anniversary edition came out we had to get it to add to the collection. Can't wait for Toy Story 3 to come out in video too .
1,Toy story,"I will never buy another DVD from Amazon again. This is the second Toy Story DVD I have gotten froAmazon and both of them do not work. I have also purchased other DVDs from amazon ""Eastbound and Down season 1"" and it does not work either. I'm so upset about the whole situation I think I will stop purchasing from Amazon all together. Amazon has just lost a customer."
3,Its good but can scare,"My eight year old loves this movie. My two, nearly three year old loves this movie up until the introduction of the bad child next doors house. From then on this film is not suitable for smaller children as it becaomes dark and scary (to them its scary). But the ending is great. So don't watch the scary bits and this is fabulous. But overall its a great movie for the family."
5,Toy Story,"Toy Story, truly LOVE this story. Love, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen--Great work on this very funny story. This DVD was gotten for a Gift. The Grandkids--love it."
3,Good source,"I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it was, as advertised, new and still in it's shrink wrap. I would suggest better packaging for delivery, as the case was slightly damaged. The movie itslef was in excellent condition and I would purchase form this source again."
4,A Cute Movie,"This was a good movie with very memorable characters. The story talked about so many different subjects, especially friendship. There were also little parts here and there that were quite entertaining. The story seems original, and the animation is of good quality. I found Sid to be a very interesting ""villain"" in this movie, being somewhat of a troubled kid with a love of destroying toys.Overall, I'd say this is a fantastic family movie, and a good movie if you like Pixar animation, although it made me strangely gentle with my toys."
5,Great purchase,"The video was in perfect condition and arrived on time. It was a little more money than I originally wanted to spend on this older movie, but this has been such a good shopping experience it was worth it."
5,LOVE! A Classic,"Love this movie. My kids love it as well. Bought this one for a friend's birthday, which I am sure he is going to LOVE! Wonderful movie for kids and adults. Such a sweet movie and even has a decent storyline and moral."
2,3D,"I like very much this movie,but unfortunetly the 3D was a little disapointing,some effect in some scene but in general the 3D is very flat,if you buy this set for the blu ray 3D may be you will have regrets."
5,"Great - shipping, time frame received and the movie itself","As always, my experience with ordering through Amazon from a private source has been easy, fast and safe. Thanks."
1,vupoint dc digital camera,THis was a waste of money-I should have sent it back but didn't. Just threw my money aaway on this one. Cheap-never did work correctly.
2,Not worth the time or money,"Most of Templar's points, are just obvious. Curiously Templar uses the word ain't throughout this book as if it's an acceptable word - spoken or written. Most of what he writes is about his experiences at his many jobs, telling me that this guy is either 125 years old or only keeps a job for a few months. Unless you have lived on an island by yourself, his points should have been something you learned growing up or watching tv.Point 8, Enjoy what you are doingPoint 11, Dress wellPoint 44, Never liePoint 61, Dress one step aheadHe repeats points over and over with minor variation.You can get better value, both time and money, from The Unwritten Laws of Business - W.J. King"
4,Read it - Think about it - Do what's right,"The book is an interestingly crafted tool to get one to think about one's personal-corporate behaviour. The other reviewers, particularly Matthew Dodd, have described it well.No tool is perfect, but it's far better than most."
5,Reflections - Carly Simon,What an outstanding album. My husband and I can't get enough. It brings back a lot of memories even for a woman that is 35. Classic Carly at her best.
5,Carly's Greatest Hits,"Fabulous album...includes all the notable songs by Carly that I remember! Watching the movie ""Heartburn"" with Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson prompted me to order this CD. The song ""Coming Around Again"" in the movie was very poignant for me at this time. As a result I wanted MORE of Carly. Also...service and delivery were ""spot on""...many thanks again for having this available at a fair price."
2,If I Hear Anticipation Again I'll Scream,"I don't understand the point of this compilation. Most of the greatest hits included here have already been defintively collected on 1975's The Best of Carly Simon. That was a long time again. I don't need or want to hear these songs again. Granted, they are classics that have found an immortal home in the sess pool that is pop culture, but they are also really worn and tired.Instead of highlighting the hits yet again, how about focusing on some of Simon's lesser known songs. ""We're So Close,"" ""Love You By Heart,"" ""It Happens Everday,"" In Times When My Head,"" are but a few of the precious gems buried deep within Simon's catologue. Let's unearth these songs, and bury ""Anticipation"" once and for all. Cause if I hear that song again, I'll scream."
2,Movie ruined by technical flaws,"was so looking forward to seeing Makiko Kuno again after Beautiful Hunter, and she was still worth seeing, but the flaws in this film just made barely watchable.The film should have been made before Beautiful Hunter, as it is a story of how she became an assassin - a prequel, if you will. It was probably just trading on that film's success. One suspects that it wasn't even released in Japan, as the title is English.The translation was so bad that it really distracted from the story. You were focused on the mismatch of the language instead of the story's progression. Also some of the supporting cast really overacted their parts to the point that they were comical.It was a good story and Kuno is always worth seeing, but it really needs work."
4,Pictures of Lily,"""Pictures of Lily""'s self-titled debut on Mississippi Records has proven to be a favorite on Minneapolis radio. It features great vocals, sophisticated lyrics with a strong female point of view, catchy pop grooves complimented by stellar guitar work, and more hooks than a tackle box. In fact, the term ""hooks"" doesn't do the song writing justice. ""Harpoons"" would be more accurate. Stand outs include ""Don't make me tell you"" and ""Carolee"". However, the entire disc is strong from top to bottom. And by the way, ladies, if you've ever been dumped by your boyfriend, check out ""No big deal"". I'm sure you'll agree..."
1,Where's the guitar?,I thought this was supposed to be an album of guitar solos! Instead its just a bunch of racket :( If you want to hear some shredding guitar solos you should buy some Winger or a Warrant album. They actually have guitar on them!
5,Adorable Disney classic!,"A cute and amazing film with great music and animation. Focusing on a tiny cute kitten Oliver and a pack of hilarious stray dogs. Dodger, the wire fox terrier is my personal fav. Full of love and humor plus action. This classic will live on."
3,What The Heck Amazon,"okay i got my DVD Oliver and company before it even said i would so i was happy about that,i love this movie its one of my favorites,i was happy to get the 20th annerversery addition from amazon for such a great price,heres my problem this dvd should have come with a cover slip for the dvd,well my copy didn't,i know this dvd comes with a cover slip over the dvd and amazon has refused to give me mine,either they took it of before shipping or something happened at the warehouse but i am very upset about this and i would like for a explanation."
5,Great movie!,My child loved this movie and so did I. It was sweet and endearing and I may end up purchasing it later.
5,Good Run Fun show!,"Wildfire is a great show that covers life in the horse racing business. I enjoyed the fourth season. There was alot of growth this year. Kris is estranged from the Ritters, she has spent some time on her own. The love of Wildfire brings her back to the scene. Dani grows up and becomes a better, nicer person. She still has her flare but its good to see a different side of her. Jean has turned Ritters farm into a Dude Ranch, western bed and breakfast. Interesting move. Matt and Junior make amends restart their friendship. Pablo stiil distrust Kris... its a good season. The wedding theme went on a bit too much but Wildfire finsihes its run with pretty good stories.I was a part of the Fan Campaign to get the show renewed for another year went on after the show was cancelled.We sent bales of hay, carrots, horseshoes, letters. It was worth it, we honored the show. The fanbase is still big. Its great to see this show on dvd. Its a great four year journey."

I purchased all my. DVD s from amazon please help me amazon maybe you can get a release on wildfire season four.Thank you gloria
1,Pure Fluff,"Not to be too negative, but from my angle, this book contains nothing of substance. It's Farhi's journal entries for a period in her life (as far as I can tell) that add nothing of value to the discussion of or learning of yoga. Save your money."
2,Censored and misguided,"This is a seriously misguided edition. Words which appeared in the First and Second editions but are now considered ""likely to offend"" have been eliminated. This means that some of the oldest words in the English language have been erased, even though the rules of Scrabble expressly permit archaic and slang terms. Merriam-Webster's job is not that of moral arbiter and if they thought it important to have a version suitable for children, then they should have released a separate children's edition, rather than mutilating the adults' one."
1,This book is out of date,"I don't know why Amazon is still pushing the 3rd edition 4 months after the release of the 4th edition, which is much superior! The 4th edition is available on Amazon as well, but you have to look elsewhere for the large print (Walmart online has it)."
2,quality is bad,"The movie quality is bad, but the photos that the camera prudes is more bad.There is a problem with the color and saturation.The camcorder is very convenes (DVD) but the camcorder is unreliable. My new camcorder has problems with the focus, after use of two weeks!"
4,My 2 year old loves these babies,My 2 year old loves these babies. We have named them and she loves to dress and undress them. Dollar store sells clothes that fit perfect. She loves the pacifiers and pretends to take care of them.
5,fans only,"this is an excellent collection of the early episodes of Dark Shadows. brought back memories of rushing home from school to catch the show in all it's glory. Fans of urban fantasy, vampires and all thing supernateral should see where it all began."
1,Price,"Nostalgia is not worth these kind of prices. I was able to get Dark Shadows - the Beginning part 1 and 2 at around $25 each several years ago. That was a reasonable price. Let me know when parts 3,4, & 5 get to that price. Otherwise, adios..."
2,Not that great,Didn't really understand it. Kind of a weird movie. Not much of a plot and it was hard to follow.
1,STUPID!!,"Worst movie EVER... Could NOT even hold my interest for the first 10 minutes. I actually tried to watch it for 30 minutes but had to shut it off!! Bad, bad movie!!"
4,Excellent color resource,This book is a great resource for choosing colors - especially if you have difficulty choosing and putting colors together. It provides information as well as inspiration. The pictures are beautiful.
5,Very Different,"The book was good, very good it was what I orders and wanted. But I want another to help me become good@ words with friend. Do u have any idea or sites to go to with bigger words. I already have, ""Word Builder"" & ""Cheats"". Thank You"
2,Not accurate enough for coffee making,"I wanted this for weighing my beans for making coffee. I only make about 26 - 32 oz of coffee for myself each day. I usually use 6 to 8 tablespoons. The problem with this scale is that 6 scoops can ""weigh"" as much as 9 or 10. I usually had to add 3 to 4 scoops of beans to get the scale to change the reading."
1,Yikes! Avoid this,"The leading contender for worst John Lee Hooker album is this overly slick stinker. What was he thinking? Did he not know trying to smooth and polish his songs into electronically enhanced mush is the worst thing he could have done? Look early, look elsewhere."
4,"Awesome, Awesome CD","What a great compilation full of wonderfully deep and sexy house music. This cd has some classic house tracks and some tracks I have never heard, the mood of the cd is edgy and sexy. Ben Stowan has a really good compilation with Bargrooves and this disk is no exception."
3,It's too old!,Book pages are very yellow. Did not have the pretty dust cover as shown. Very disappointed. Oh well.......Took a chance.
4,How Does Your Garden Grow?,"Simple charming sketches of wholly imaginative flowers or plants with two-word all-nonsense descriptive captions, such as """"Open Bukia"" demands good and concentrated attention. Leaves turn with maturity."" Or try ""Pototea"" of the pitcher plant family. Plant and flower lovers will especially appreciate the wit and humor inspired by Edward Lear."
3,A bit less than expected,"A bit of a let down, but not too much so. I enjoyed Garden of Lies much more so perhaps that explains my less than stellar feeling about this one. It seemed somehow less personal and I didn't find myself drawn as much into the lives of the characters. A respectable read absolutely but not what I was expecting based on Garden of Lies."
3,Good but somewhat repetitive,"I think the soundtracks great, but the same melody seems to be carried out through almost all of the songs. It's great to listen to kind of in the background, but if you want to listen to something to actually LISTEN to it, it's not the most intruiging."
5,WOW,"This is the second CD I've bought by Baaba Maal, and it is truly amazing. The rhythyms, words, intensity overwhelm the listener. My two kids and I dance around the room listening. A bonus are the two videos on the CD--one, miyaabele is far superior to anything you can see on TV. THe second, a short documentary on the making of the CD really shows the depth and love that Baaba Maal holds for his homeland and all of Africa--and therefore all of us. His dream of a unified Africa, well it is a grand dream, my dream would be to go one step farther and use music like this to remind all of us just how much we have in common. This CD is also great in the classroom, with the videos it is a nice intro to African music..."
3,Paris and more Paris,I like Juliette Binoche in almost any movie and it's always a pleasure to catch glimpses of Paris other than the standard touristy ones.
5,Great Book,I bought this used book for a gift. I read it a long time ago which inspired me to begin my own spiritual quest. The book arrived quickly in excellent condition.
2,5 Sentence Review,"Honestly, I did not like this story. Thier is not much wrong with the general theme of the story, but plenty, I feel, in the way it is told. Its a tell-all-book that refuses to show anything to the reader. This book falls into the very bland and dragging read category, or vbadrc for short :). But what do I know."
4,I couldn't put it down!,"Wow, this book keeps you on the edge of your seat! It thrills you and haunts you. I read this book in one day because it was so enthralling! Everytime I heard a creepy noise I would look behind me scared I might see something creepy! It's a lot of fun to read and very entertaining. This would be a great book to read if ya like mystery or creepy stories! Happy reading!"
3,Stacy's review of A Deadly Game of Magic,"I think my book A Deadly Game of Magic by Joan Lowery Nixon wasn't that good at all. She had a great plot for her story, but as soon as the characters became emotionally attached to each other it made a big love triangle and the book just fell apart from there. It was an emotional rollercoaster that was hard to understand at first, but once one problem would be solved another one would seem to happen. I think Nixon also didn't use her details as effeciently as she could have. All in all nixon wrote a good book but she could use more details and less of teenaged people trying to get with each other becasue she makes it unrealistic. Nixon's book looked good at first but as I finished this book my expectations of it dropped."
4,great book,"This book was a good suspense story although i would not recommmend it for people under 12 for its language. Overall, it's a pretty good book."
4,Best Mates,"Brann and Rafe are the best!I really liked Skye from the first book. I am glad that Syndelle is so very different. This way the sisters don't have to compete and if we are judging just by over all power - Syndelle would have to win hands down.But the stars for me in this book are Brann and Rafe. Rafe may start off as being crass and putting up walls - but as the story continues we find out why and the interaction between these three characters was super.I really liked that there was no wavering from Syndelle - she recognized her mates and is willing to face life head on. Also really enjoyed the continuation of seeing Skye, Gian and Rico. Also Roman - who is in book three is introduced."
1,Do Not Buy This,Avoid this item. It breaks quickly. The caps on the pill compartments break off after being used only a few times. Spend your money on another brand.
1,"Crude, not for families","Almost bought this because I liked the main actors. But, I thought I should watch a couple of episodes on youtube first. Glad I did. If you like frequent profanity and extramarital sex treated as a joke with no consequences, then this show is for you. It was not for me. The Melissa character is shallow and unlikeable. Why is this channel called ABC FAMILY? This show is not for children or teenagers, and not for adults who value fidelity."
2,cd,"i thought it was only Pandit Jasraj recording, but it is not. Also the ending of the CD does not play well..."
5,Works way better than expected on litter box odor,I bought this little air sanitizer a few months ago when I relocated the litter box to my mud room. Plugged it and really hadn't thought much about it until this morning when I smelled cat litter odor. Turns out a my son tossed his boots on the floor by the unit causing it to come unplugged. I plugged it back in and about an hour later the odor was gone. I am truly amazed how effective it has been.
3,"not for quiet spaces, but still useful.","i'm still on the fence w/ this product, but the husband likes it. we bought it while on stay-cation in a stinky condo. too noisy for the bedroom. did not work on the foul odors in there, but we brought it home anyway because it was affordable, and we wanted to give it a fair chance.we keep it near the stairs (kind of below them) by a bathroom, the 'pantry' and the back door. the musty, funky, moldy smell is GONE from there now, and it gives a nice light to the dark walkway, but i hear it when i'm nearby and it is annoying. a high-pitched hum...UPDATE:After several weeks, I gave it to my Dad, who is hard of hearing and surrounded by outdoor free-range chickens and their feathers...as far as I know, it is working well in his small space.Meanwhile, the mustiness is back under my stairs...will have to keep searching for something that works well over there."
3,Much louder than I thought,"I bought 2 of these as part of the gold box deals. The description says ""whisper quiet"" but it sounds like you have a floor fan in the room. We decided to put it in our bedroom, but it was too loud so we put it in the master bath (even then I could hear it). I guess I'm used to the Air-O-Swiss ultrasonic humidifier which made NO NOISE whatsoever, and we also place the humidifier in the master bath which is adjacent to our bedroom. I'm not sure if the bedroom/bathroom smells better or is cleaner, but it was an interesting gadget to try out."
3,You Gotta Have Faith,"When I got this my son asked how we could know if it works. I explained that we had no way of knowing, we just had to rely on what the manufacturer says and reviews. I can't really say whether it works or not. What I can say is that it is extremely loud. The day after I plugged it in the kitchen, I walked in and thought that there was something wrong with my refrigerator because of the noise. Then I realized that it was the germ guardian."
5,"Great product, good service","Received it promtly. Use it every day for air quality control, around food. Simple, easy to operate, emits gentle hummming sound and blue light."
5,Best programming product ever made,"It is true that this product does not contain much documentation because if you are buying it, you should alredy know a little pascal. Plus it comes with a TON of electronic documentation. This product is far better than Visual basic for 2 reasons: It has the Power of C++. It is about as easy as Visual Basic. BUT IT!"
2,Can't trust it,"My scale gave different readings, depending on where you placed items on the plate.Everything I baked came out way too dry, since this scale habitually gave low readings.I ended up throwing this one away and buying one from another manufacturer.If it had actually worked correctly it would have gotten 5 stars. It was otherwise well-constructed and attractive."
1,DON&#65533;T WASTE YOU&#65533;RE MONEY OR TIME,"This has to be one of the worst cd's I have come acrossin a long Time. The mixing is not bad but I can't say muchfor the music, Don't waste you're time."
5,Slammin' it in Delaware,This is by far one of the best additions to my entertainment system... the 505 has a low-hard hit that puts you in the middle of the action... well worth every dollar.
1,Over rated speaker size,"The speaker size is only 6 1/3 inches. I have a set of 10 inch PMS speakers and the base speakers, them-selves, are 10 inches. The overall diameter is is 12 inches. These speakers are listed as 12 inches; that includes their out most diameter, not the size of the speaker.This size is an over rated, less than what is listed."
4,Sick,I have had this sub for about a month and it is used strickly for music. It is the bomb and worth the money. I am thinking of buying another for my living room to pair with my 70 inch TV.
5,Lots of boom,I am very satisfied with my purchase. The sub really hits hard. Nice and low decibels. Great for games and music also.
5,iiiiitssss reeally hhhaaard to ttyyppe with alllll thiis bbbbbaaaassss,"Ok I had to turn it down to actually type, if you live in an apartment complex expect a noise complaint within the hour. Totally worth it thou. I look forward to getting more."
5,WOW! Can't beat this one!,"Bought this on Amazon for 199.00 free shippping. Worth every penny. My wife, however, doesn't particularly care for it. Deep bass on music and on blu ray's..wow! I watched the opening scene from Dark Knight...You won't believe it till you buy it. I found using the red\white input jacks seemed better than the LFE input. Roughly similar in sound until you get a splitter and run 2 input jacks in the red\white. YOu may feel differently , but this is how I think it sounded the best. All in all, awesome sub, very happy with it, and POWERFUL!"
4,An oldie but goodie!!,"I have loved Polk Audio equipment for along time. My PSW505 is now approaching 4 yrs. old and I have no need to replace it. I is never boomy unless you don't have the crossover freq. set right for your room or to much volume. It has made the transition to my new home entertainment system along with my trusty old Polk center channel CS245 & Samsung LNS2A650A1F 52"" hd tv. New additions to this system now include: Marantz AV7005 processor coupled to a Matantz MM7055 5 channel power amp, with and ART HQ231 31 band equalizer and an Tascam CD-RW900SL cdr, along with an old Sony PS3 & Direct TV HR100. Back surround's are my old mains (JBL E100).So once the room was calibrated using the Audessy mic and software on the AV7055 all I can say is wow! The subwoofer is truly transparent in it's frequency range and just ""flows"" with the rest of the system. You can feel it Hal....!!!"
5,Great Subwoofer,"excellent bass sound, hooked up to a Denon receiver. has more than enough power for a 20 x 30 room, you could use this in a 50 x 50 room easily. only need to use about 30% of volume. was an inexpensive upgrade with excellent results."
5,Love it,Love this sub. Hits hard and accurate with music and my movies. Going to buy another one and put in a different corner.
5,Great sound reproduction,"This Polk subwoofer blew all of my expectations out of the water. As other reviews will say, this sub is loud and will definitely cover all the needs of a home theatre system. The volume control for the sub, which is found on the back, is very useful as it can sometimes be overpowering of the other sounds (in your music, movies, etc). This ""overpowering"" is not a problem, but it is hard to be respectful of my neighbors in my apartment building. Normal volumes are fine throughout the week, but I usually don't watch movies or listen to music more loudly until the weekend. It's easy to love this sub, and should provide anyone with the sound they need, and at the price it sells for on Amazon right now, you may not find a better deal. Again, forewarning for those in apartments, this could piss off the neighbors, but it is easily controllable if you are able to control yourself."
5,Love it!,"I'm just going to add more credibility to the masses that say this is an outstanding product. I use it in a home office of about 13x15, so it's a bit overkill maybe.The only disadvantage would be that it's quite large."
5,Polk has done a great job,"When I read reviews I am trying to decide if it is safe/good value to buy the product. The short answer is go ahead and buy this, but let me make a few points:Pros:1. The sound is great! Scared the heck out of my wife when we as a family watched Star Wars and the first thing blew up and the subwoofer shook her chair.2. Good documentation, but please read it so you set it up for your system. It will make a big difference on sound quality.Cons:I know people will be critical of the size (I use it as an end table), but that is in part where the great sound is generated. If you don't care about ""big sound"" from your home theater then you might look for something smaller. I want the full movie effect and this is the best subwoofer I have ever owned, but read the size specs and make sure you know where it is going to go before you order it."
4,best cop show ever produced...just one little annoyance,"I waited with baited breath for this to come out.I never missed an episode first run and to find a program that me AND the wife liked was a rarety in itself!I'm almost all the way through this set now and the ONLY problem i have with this is that...well...its 2006 and technology certainly exists to have included captions for the hearing impaired.I'm deaf in one ear and have to turn the volume WAY up or I won't really catch everything.So...i watch in the daytime when i got the house to myself.It never occurred to me to even check,i assumed that darn near all DVD's released in the great new millenium would have that.oh well...live and learn.That having been said...(whinewhinewhine)...the complexities of the characters on this show are so brilliantly written AND acted that viewing this set should be mandatory!"
4,Homicide: Life on the Street - The Complete Series (repackaged),I like having all the shows including the cross overs and not having to pay a ridiculous amount for it.The only real criticism I have is there are mo captions available. Being hard of hearing this would have been nice to have.Other than that its nice to have a good quality show to watch.
4,Homicide: Life on the Street - The Complete Series (Repackaged),"""Homicide is one of the all time great TV mystery series. A great collection of characters and gritty stories and a new standard for realism."
5,Excellent value,"This book, in its third edition, is simple enough for beginners but still challenging for those with experience. It is relatively inexpensive and is a great tool for training conductors. The author is humorous while at the same time very direct in instruction. Highly recommneded."
2,Inadequate,"I had high hopes for this book, which might be why I found it disappointing. It is riddled with obvious typos (not what I'd expect from a professional writer), and fails to go into detail about some of the most important subjects. She devotes only two pages to getting clients, and her main advice is ""ask previous clients for referrals"" and ""ask your literary agent""--not very useful for someone looking to get started in the business. She does have some useful checklists, including things to ask potential clients, but overall this book left me with more questions than answers."
2,Good information marred by poor execution,"The author of this book has many interesting and helpful points to make, but they are mired down by such statements as ""ghost writers pour over research ..."" and by inconsistent, often incorrect, punctuation, diction, and spelling. These errors are so prevalent they really get in the way of the useful information she has to share.As a ghostwriter myself, I found Shaw's book to have some nice nuggets. However, mining them was harder than it should have been. A stronger editorial eye would have helped this book. There are even mistakes in the Table of Contents and Acknowledgments. The author is clearly a professional, but this work is so unpolished it is not a good advertisement for her skills."
4,insight on life in that kind of Ecuador,"I agree, it's an interesting perspective on a situation that many are aware about in Ecuador. The movie was a bit too long for the plot. Then it ends abrubtly! I think the whole point to this film is to show that the situation has no easy or quick solution. This is proved by the many trials and situations Angel and Salvador get themselves into. It seems that Salvador still young, at the end has grown and has become smarter from the beginning of the film, but Angel simply has a long way to go before he learns.The violence is not gory or graphic, it is smartly and subtley displayed.It seemed like the action just kept going on and on, it was at sometimes annoying, because the plot was not going anywhere. It is an interesting take on the situation in Ecuador and is not a bad film at all, just seems like the point of the film could have been summed up quicker.This movie is like Y Tu Mama tambien, but without the ending that brings it all together."
2,Wellington Cordage Rating,"I only gave this product 2 stars, not for the product it'self but the discription was misleading.I was looking for 100% pure cotton cord but like most it has a synthetic center core that made it useless for my needs.The product it'self is fine if you are looking for a strong light cord but the synthetic core but it's not what I needed"
4,Good value for money,"Having 3 young boys, these toys are a blast. Each toy with its special characteristics. Good value for money."
1,Boring Yawnfest,"I rarely like Kelsey Grammer, and this continues my long legacy of disinterest in his work. I also don't feel he has had a successful movie crossover career, most of his movies falling into forgettful tandemonium (is that even a word?)."
1,WORST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!,listen to me very clearly the people who written these reviews they do not know what they are talking about. worst show ever kelsey grammer was terrible patricia heaton was super hot but the show is terrible the acting the story the characters just a hunk of garbage. everybody loves raymond was wayy better than this show. patricia heaton is on the show the middle which is perfect thats why she left because of how bad the show was. I dont see kelsey grammer in any movies anymore because hes very bad i know it and half the population knows it i am sorry but i would rather watch ishtar than this show. that is the main reason why the show was on the air for a year because its veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy BAD!! people please do not buy this show it is bad i can promise u that buy everybody loves raymond its way better or watch the middle a better show. dont be offended im just telling u what i think of the show.
1,Off base,"Well... If one is a devout Christian and thinks prayers will help, then this is the book for you. I dealt with a foul psychic vampire of the worst sort, and if I had used Ms. Shumsky's method, I would be dead and my family totally destroyed. I am giving this away for the cost of shipping. Thank the gods that my best friend is a healer and helped me and my family get ""it"" out of our lives. Sending love is not the safest route at times."
5,Very well thought out book.,I would recommend this book to any one who wants a basic guide to oriental vegetable propagation. Worth a read.
2,Working title - Japanese and Chinese Vegetables,"This book focuses almost entirely on Japanese and Chinese vegetables. If that is all you are interested in, the book provides good information. Otherwise - no.Note to author - there are many other ""oriental"" countries in Asia besides Japan and China."
3,"Good Song, But Gets Old","""Left behind"" was the one of the reasons I bought ""Iowa"". The song gets stuck in your head (at least when you first hear it), and you just have to buy the Cd to get it out. The chorus is great, as are the verses. And the music video is amazing, Slipknot's best video yet. But, if you want this song, get ""Iowa"", as the song does get old, and there are so many other great songs on ""Iowa""."
3,you get what you pay for,"The charger is OK. It is made out of really cheap plastic though, and it is very hard to plug into the phone sometimes giving you the feeling you are going to break your phone, same with the ear piece."
2,No foot chart!,"The description and front of the DVD packaging states that a Foot Chart is included. No foot chart! :-( There were clips inside the DVD case for such a chart, but nothing at all, other than the DVD, was included."
4,Learned alot!!,I found this DVD very educating. I have been having some nerve problems and have tried multiple remedies and not too much has helped. I'm excited to apply the techniques I learned in this DVD.
2,Needs more emphasis on grammar,"If your whole intention of learning a new language is to memorize phrases that will get you by when you are travelling, then this book is adequate. However, if you really want to learn how a language is structured, forget this book. Learning the basics of grammar i.e. verb conjugation, etc. is fundamental and to me, the obvious starting point. It is of little benefit to memorize how to say ""Excuse me, but where might I find the secretary?"" if I don't even know which word is the verb or which word is the subject. The tapes do not necessarily follow the exercises in the book, so I got lost rather often. One advantage, though, is that the tapes are spoken clearly, and it would not take a person very long to catch on to the pronunciation (once you've memorized how to say ""Thank you for your hospitality, Miss O'Donnell."")"
3,This book gives a good introduction to the language.,"This book is a good introduction, though to grasp the hard pronunciation I would strongly reccomend getting the audio casettes as well. For those looking for further study, I would recommend Micheal O Siadhail's Learning Irish book and audio casettes. This edition includes an extensive vocabulary list, as well as a simple Irish-English/English-Irish dictionary."
1,"Far from ""Learning Irish"" or ""Irish on Your Own""","Having a grandmother from Co. Cork in Ireland, I have always been interested in the Irish language and speak it well . Irish is not an altogether easy language to learn, and this book certainly doesn't help. The conversations are unnatural, the vocabularies are messy and the grammar is hardly explained at all. Bascially, this book encourages you to memorise phrases, not to actually learn to talk on your own. Ironically, there used to be another Teach Yourself Irish by M. Dillon, which was much better on teaching Irish.Do learn Irish, but avoid this book. My first recommendation would be ""Learning Irish"", followed by ""Irish on Your Own"". They are both superior to this book in every way. Another noticable point. The Irish taught in this book is a stilted language, removed from the native speakers, while both the other books are based on Irish as it is actually spoken."
