5,Love disney music,Disney music is very soothing and makes me nostalgic. I immediately associate the music with the movie in which it was played
4,Sturdy,This shoe was really sturdy and lasted me a long time. I wore it on more day to day routine and it took the daily grind well.
1,Discipline with wooden spoons and switches,"There is nothing loving about this. Dobson is a control freak who thinks it's fine to beat kids into submission.Where does this guy draw the line between certifiable child abuse and discipline? Wire coat hangers? Rubber hoses?I hope that when Dobson is old, whiney, and confused, and dependent on his grown kids to help him, they give back the same treatment they got from him: spank and pray, spank and pray."
5,The Feelings Book,Todd Parr is an exceptional children's book author. This book is simple and fun. My five year old and her Kindergarten classmates love The Feelings Book!
5,AN EYE OPENER,"Wow! this book is an eye opener, truly a God sent. It makes you truly see that it is not the job of the believer to sit around and sulk over the situations in the church and world, the ordinary beleiver can themselves make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone, women, men, laymen, clergy or young people who are looking for the higher calling of God in their lives."
5,"A Sad Story, But Still A Goodie","This story is about an abusive relationship, that's true. And Wen Fu is ""two-dimensional"". Also true. (Aren't all bullies?) But it's more than that. It's a story about sharing secrets. The daughter has a secret she SHOULD tell her mother. The mother has a secret she SHOULD tell her daughter. But neither one of them likes to communicate to the other--until a third party threatens to reveal their secrets FOR them should unless they do it themselvss.Again, Amy Tan's books are about mothers and daughters, so the relationships of the men are put on the backburner. If stories about women and ""woman power"" just ""isn't your thing"", put it down and move on.Still an amazing book!"
4,Hoping it would have been better,"This book was good. But not nearly as good as The Joy Luck Club. After reading the Joy Luck Club, I was hoping to find another gem. This book is O.K. but not great."
4,Question,Referring to the vintage cover: I was wondering if anyone can tell me what the symbol on the front cover of the book means (the one at the very bottom).
5,How can her life be worse?,"The truth is that the first couple of chapters are not veryexciting at all! Yet I can not put the book down when Winnie, the narrator of her own life in the book, began to reveal to her daughter, Pearl, that her mother disappeared, might have died, or ran away with another man, when she was at a very young age. When Winnie was about seventeen, she married Wen Fu, whom she discovered later to be a cruel, spoiled, and power thirsty man. The marriage turned out to be the worst nightmare of her life. She made the decision to gave up all the children from Wen Fu by abortion because she didn't want them to live under such a father. Then came the Japanese invasion into China, and this war gave her the chance to meet someone who truly loves her, and a chance to escape to a better life. The part I liked the most was the message behind Lady Sorrowfree. We should always keep in mind to have our ""happiness winning our bitterness, no regrets in this world."""
4,Go Amy Tan!,"I first read this book when it was assigned to me to read as an English project, I liked it so much that I then read the book again with my mother, who thought that the book was as good as I thought. This book has brought the two of us together and I'm so excighted to read the rest of Amy Tan's books. I recomend this book to any high school woman and her mother."
2,Echh,"This book isn't horrible, but it's really really bad. NOTHING actually happened until about 3/4 of the way through the book. The main character, Helena (Nell), is way too hard to relate to because she is PERFECT. This book was really boring, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 8."
2,has a headphone out but no sound,I thought I could plug in my headphones and use the metronome but NOPE. The tuner works like any other tuner. The metronome has diffrent settings but can't hear them cuz I can't plug in my headphones. It's kind of hard to hear over live drums.
3,BOSS TU-80 rundown,Length:: 2:55 MinsIn this review I do a quick summary of everything you want to know about the TU-80. I gave this product 3 stars because of the lack of headphone support while using the metronome. Also because the volume cannot be adjusted.
2,"Good tuner, but I felt stupid for trying to kill 2 birds with 1 stone","Like the title says, I found this at my local Guitar Center, and thought I'd kill 2 birds with 1 stone and get a tuner and metronome together. The tuner works fine, but if you are honestly going to use the metronome, GET SOMETHING ELSE. This thing is way too quiet and there's no way to fix it."
2,Looks Aren't Everything.,"Go check out the consumer reports Nov. 04. They rated fair on hd programming, good on dvd playback and good with regular TV via normal and high quality inputs. However, it did not get any Very Good or Excellent ratings. My own personal experience was negative. I purchased this TV and had problems with dark colors causing too much pixelation, fuzziness, and split second delays with character movement. Thus I returned the TV. Other negatives included no speakers and tough installation. The only thing I liked about the TV were its brights colors and panel design. However, I feel this is one of those ""You get what you pay for"" buys."
1,Garbage!!!,After initial use this adapter just fell apart. The male connecting pin came apart at each black ring section. I don't know what they were thinking with the build of this product. The only reason it got one star is because it wouldn't accept zero stars. Very unhappy. :-(
1,Has potential but falls short...,"I was really looking forward to getting this album and had good expectations for it. After a few listenings I relegated it to my junk CD pile. Here's what I think is wrong. The singing is not good. It is monotonous and shows no range. Also I think the singing does not match the style of music. This album sounds a bit too ""southern"" and it does not mesh well with the musical arrangements given to the songs. This album sounds confused and too many of the songs simply sound alike. They just blend into each other and there are no real highlights in the mix."
4,if you like this...,"you should definately listen to Beechwood Sparks. They are defunct now, melding into the Tyde, but you'd swear these 2 bands came from the same family. Both lovely, beautiful, sun-drenched California rock."
1,This CD SUCKS,"One of the WORSTE CD investments Ive made in recent decades. I bought it with Tim Burgess' new CD as part part of Amazon's ""buy them together"" deals. What a mistake. This album is so grating and cliche that I would not even play if my wife hadn't forbidden me from putting it in the stereo. Truly aweful."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"NOWHERE IN THE DESCRIPTION DID IT SAY THAT THESE WERE THE PLAYS. I LOVE ALL OF TYLER PERRYS MOVIES BUT I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN I HAD GONE TO WATCH THEM AND CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE NOT THE MOVIES, BUT THE PLAYS."
3,Abravanel's Swan Lake,"Maurice Abravanel was a wonderful conductor, who built the Utah into a great regional orchestra, as they display here. But, it's a shame that Abravanel performs a slightly abridged edition. Look elsewhere, unfortunately."
4,A lifesaver!,"Drawing the Line: Ten Steps to Constructive Discipline--And Achieving a Great Relationship with Your Kids offers hope to harried parents who are looking for a compassionate way to work with their children.By using engaging stories and anecdotes to illustrate their ideas, Drs. Michael Weiss and Sheldon Wagner offer simple alternatives to punishment, lengthy and ineffective time-outs, and power struggles with kids. Their easy-to-follow, common-sense tips are nothing short of life-changing for parents who have been in search of a ""better way"" to communicate with and gain cooperation from their children.Whether you're battling at bedtime, having a hard time with toilet training, or you're concerned about a toddler who subsists only on yogurt and grilled cheese, this book is sure to help restore harmony in your home.Armchair Interviews says: A lifesaver for frustrated parents who want a better relationship with their kids."
2,Don't buy this first... you might want to skip it altogether,"Oddly enough, this is the last R.E.M. album I bought -- after buying every other album except their last release, ""UP"". Had I bought this first, it probably would have been my last. Yes, ""Losing My Religion"" is a good song. However, with eleven tracks, you might say that the CD has too many tracks...Only three songs (LMR, Texarkana, and Me In Honey) are worth listening to, ""Near Wild Heaven"" just missed, ""Low"" and ""Belong"" are ridiculous, and ... well, ""Shiny Happy People""? Need I say more?Make no mistake, R.E.M. are probably the best band in recent memory, and are (by far) my favorite band -- I bought tickets for the current tour 1,200 miles from home.But this momentary side trip into artsy-craftsy, largely frivolous tunes was (thankfully) short.R.E.M.'s Best Music: AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE. Best Rock: DOCUMENT. Best Overall: LIFES RICH PAGEANT (an incredibly underrated album)."
3,Losing my religion,"I bought 'Out of time' because I consider 'Losing my religion' one of the best songs of all time (if not the best) but I was in the begining a little disappointed to find that the whole CD wasn't actually on the same level of 'Losing...' Anyway though it may not be great there are still some songs that are really worth buying it (talking about 'Country feedback', 'Half a world away' and others). I think I'll buy 'Automatic for the people' in the future so I hope it'll be a little better."
1,rem needs to get a life,i hated this band to begin with no talent here! when mike stipe said that the beatles are elevator music he was way out of line i think this is the worst band i ever heard in my life and coming from me that is not so good!
2,2 1/2 Stars,"The band's commercial breakthrough and artistic lowpoint, OOT takes too many chances, goes in too many directions and comes up short in almost all of them. R.E.M. doing rap is scary indeed. Mike Mills and Bill Berry are great backup singers behind Stipe, but make them lead vocalists and the results are dire.""Belong"" rips off Aerosmith of all bands for it's ""Sweet Emotion"" style riff. Classical instrumentation abounds to negative effect. and Kate Pearson reaffirms herself as a vocalist best seen and not heard on the tracks where she adds to the clutter.Only the hit ""Losing My Religion"" (which is a hands-down classic), the repetative ""Low"" and ""Half A World Away"" are up to the usual standard.Unfortunately, R.E.M. would never be the same again."
3,One of their weakest,"This is one of R.E.M's weakest albums, man. It aint 'cause its one of their most popular (""Automatic for the People"" is their best) but just 'cause most of the songs are totally forgetable. Of course ""Losing my Religion"" is wicked crazy and ""Shiny Happy People"" is tight, but the reat is mad whatever."
1,"Disappointing book, to say the least","This book dishonors Barbaro. It is poorly written with many sloppy mistakes. It is a hodge-podge of unattributed articles. Some great pictures, but again, poorly edited and sometimes incorrect captions.Buyers, beware!!!"
3,"Try It, You Might Like It","I am a fan of Barbaro but wasn't as disappointed as others appear to be. It is what it is -- a digest of events in Barbaro's short but inspiring life and his connections. I think it will be a good, quick read for those who didn't follow Barbaro as intently as some of us. Personally I liked that some of the quotes from the website were included. The average reader and readers in the future won't know about them. I liked the glossary and actually learned a couple of new things there. If I were to read a similar book about a horse from long ago that I knew nothing about, I would consider it an okay read. I do hope corrections are made where there are errors."
3,A minor disappointment,"When I purchased this item, I believed that it would be a comprehensive overview of the study of history by a variety of Marxists. Instead, despite, the author's promise not to there is only discussion what Marx said. More distressingly, is an ommission of any discussion of contemporary Marxist historians influenced by the works of Gramsci (who only gets one sentence).I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to get back to Marx and study history without the bias of Marxist, telling you the correct interpetation but not for those who wish to study the controveries imbedded in a term such as Historical Materialism."
5,A Great overview of the Vietnam War,"I actually ordered this book after reading Tatjana Soli's ""The Lotus Eaters."" That novel left me wanting to know more about the Vietnam War. I was an adolescent in the late 60's/early 70's, and while I saw images and read headlines every day, I really didn't understand the war. Caputo has put together a very comprehensive, compelling history of this long and brutal conflict."
4,a look at the celebration of the Chinese New Year,"This book is an excellent addition to a library collection on China or on various types of New Year celebrations around the world. A recipe for both baked and steamed nian-gao is included at the end. In the reading aloud, this book has a subtle message about sharing and compassion although I think the text gets a little irritating when, over and over, ""something incredible happened"". Just as a description is not made more so by the endless use of ""very"", an event is not made more incredible when it is announced in advance that it will be incredible... and, in fact, it detracts a bit from the magic. I think the text could be a bit more sophisticated but, overall, this is still a wonderful story to share."
3,The Run Away Rice Cake,The Run Aaway Rice Cake is a about this family called the Chang family. They make a rice cake. It becomes alive. It runs away. I recommend this book to people who like silly stories and rice cakes. By Bryan G.
2,Copycat,"I bought this book from Amazon a few weeks ago, but I do not like it at all.I think the authors did not want spend enough time to write a good book. They are only interested in getting your money. This book was very badly organized and in very bad format.I do not think the authors understanding Solaris quite well. You can get the most information in this book on the Internet. Looks like they copied some articles on the Inetnet and changed a little bit then INSERTed them into this book."
1,Unconditional Love from a second paradigm shifter,"The word 'SECOND PARADIGM SHIFTER' was discovered by my new ""I am that I am"" on father's day in 1996. At around the same time the creator of the word 'PARADIGM SHIFT' passed away, please look-up the New York Times orbituaries for the next day. If as in CWG and the Celestine Prophecy, there is no such thing as coincidence and we are indeed all equal as in 'if you know you'll die tomorrow,what will you do now' or 'do you know you will not die tomorrow' or 'there is only one thing coming from the future ever since everyone of us were born', then you the reader will understand why I rate this EXCELLENT BOOK with ONE star = ONENESS = UNCONDITIONAL LOVE = EQUALITY IN DEATH THUS LIFE = love my self as I would love my neighbor(s) = every moment can be one's new birthday."
1,Not for this Christian,"A friend talked me into reading all 3, it had me confused for a while, she honestly went nuts after reading them. I had to end our friendship and I gave all my copies away LOL True story :)"
4,Food for the soul,"I find CWG inspirational and up-lifting. Great book!! I also recommend two other books that fit in the same category. ""The Third Time Is Now""...&...The Journey to Fruition. These two author's have alot in common."
5,Book 2,"After reading Book 1, I had to read Book 2. I plan to get every book Neale writes. I have found my truth."
5,"God, thank you (in advance) for a beautiful book!","I started re-reading Book 1 yesterday and the passage that stayed with me was...""The correct prayer is therefore never a prayer of supplication, but a prayer of gratitude"" (pg 11).Therefore...God, thank you for bringing joy and peace into my life and helping me re-member who I am. I love you.Please buy Book 3...it's a masterpiece!"
1,COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THE BIBLE,"There is alot of good stuff in these books for you to think about and learn from. BUT, IT SAYS INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE THINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY OK WITH GOD, SUCH AS CHILD MOLESTATION for example. I was very excited about this collection but half way through book 1, I threw them all in the recycle bin. The movie however was excellent and extremely uplifting.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU RENT THE MOVIE AND FORGET ABOUT THESE BOOKS. The movie does not delve into the things that GOD is supposedly telling him that he writes in his books. DON`T WASTE YOURE MONEY ON THESE BOOKS !Alex"
1,NEW AGE MUMBO JUMBO FROM A THIRD RATE PHILOSOPHER,Walsch resonates as a third-rate (to be very generous)philosopher to a New Age generation whichlongs to have someone in the name of God tell it what it wants to hear. Pity those who take him seriously.
2,The Book Wars,"I read all three Conversations with God books and enjoyed each of them. I think there is much of God in the words.Unfortunately, as Walsch has continued writing, each of his books has more of Neale and less of God in them. Book one was very clearly inspired by spirit, book two was somewhat spirit inspired and book three is mostly Neale Donald Walsch's ego pretending to write inspired words. Tis a pity. Success can be challenging.However Mr Walsch did inadvertently provide a massive amount of entertainment in the form of the Amazon reviews that Christians have written. They can all be summed up as ""The Book Wars"".Basically. ""My special book is the word of God and your book was written by the devil.""Jews, Mormons, Christians, Muslims, Scientologists, etc, etc, all have their special book. Each says that God wrote one book and one book only and that all the other books are blasphemous.Silly but entertaining."
5,Makes Cleaning Up After Your Dog Quick and Easy,"I love the wire rake scooper. Makes quick, easy work of cleaning up after your dog. I am using this combined with a 5-gallon bucket and lid lined with a kitchen trash bag. I keep the bucket in an out of the way corner of my backyard, drop the poop in the bucket and come garbage day pull out the bag and out it goes. Quick, clean, easy and inexpensive.One word of warning though, if your yard has weeds the rake may get caught it them. I just bought my house and the yard needs some work but I figure as soon as the weeds are gone I won't have any problems at all."
4,"Good product, but 2 small flaws...","Works very well for removing every bit of poop out of your grass. It's made that job a lot easier; BUT, there are 2 flaws in my opinion: The scoop part is curved upward, so If you're trying to fling the poop elsewhere, it has a boomerang effect and can come right back at ya! (I throw it in a empty wooded lot I own, not a neighbor's yard ;))I also don't know why they didn't make the handle longer. I'm only 5'4"" tall; and between the short handle and oddly curved rake, I really have to crouch down to get the perfect angle so I can catch my prey. It really should not be that difficult. Just make a longer handle, with a straight rake and I'd be soooo happy! That's why I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I do recommend it over all other poop scoopers for grass though. It really speeds up the process."
4,Not perfect but helps with an unpleasant task,"I have a 65 pound Greyhound and a fairly small yard so I needed something that would work better than a shovel, so I decided to try this. I am in Virginia so my lawn is not bluegrass nor the Bermuda grass found in Florida; it's somewhere in between with a lot of weeds thrown in for good measure. The tins on this product are about perfect for my type of lawn and the size of my dog's dropping. About 90% of the droppings can be easily picked up, and I estimate that cleaning my back yard took about half the time that it would take to clean it using a shovel or more complicated pooper scooper.Pros:Inexpensive and shipped quicklyWorks welltins are properly spaced for a larger dogCons:I'm a little over 6 feet tall, so I had to stoop quite a bit. An adjustable length pole would have been a good addition.The tins are a little bit weak, it seems like they will bend over time"
3,Nicht das beste Buch,"This textbook was ok. I felt that it was disorganized and I found that I had to flip back to the dictionary more than I usually did in foreign language texts. You definitely need an instructor for this book, otherwise you'll feel lost. Some of the examples and exercises they used were weird, too.Fun piece of information: The college students in the story arcs of this text bear a huge resemblance to the kids in the Magic School Bus."
1,Dont buy!!!,Don't waste your money. You only see very short clips of concerts( 30 seconds to a minute) or video's. The rest is just critic's talking about Genesis. Complete garbage!!! Don't take it somenoe offers it for free.
5,Wow!,"I hadn't realized that Bob Walkenhorst had recorded a solo album. I found a copy of this one in a thrift store of all places. From the opening bars of ""life Can Turn"" I was hooked. Age has not softened Walkenhorst's edgy outlook. His voice has matured but still retains the energy from earlier releases. A great selection of music. Try playing Jan Vermeer really loud!It's a great CD."
1,Utter Crap,"These are the ravings of a very paranoid person. Women who read this book, I suspect, are pretty miserable. Looking for a way to place blame are we, ladies? And, what on earth does any of this have to do with Liberals. Can we tell we are being pandered to here?"
4,Very Interesting,"This book is quite insightful...although it's not telling me too much of what I didn't already suspect. Sometimes it sounds like she's ""getting back"" at some of the women she writes about and her writing style, although an easy and fun read, sounds like an article from one of the girly magazines she talks about. But that's to be expected since she was editor for many years.But even taking into account the things I mentioned above, it's pretty fascinating and I've enjoyed reading it."
5,"Good product, fits right",These cartridges fit the correct pen and came in a nice blue/black. The item came exactly as described. Very satisfied.
2,wrong item,"This pack was supposed to be blue and black ink, but it was only blue. The pen came with blue ink too, so until I find someplace to get black ink, this pen is useless to me. Too much hassle to return such a cheap item, I wish they would have gotten it right the first time."
4,Much faster than a nozzel,"If you are going to clean a driveway, sidewalk or patio the Whirl A Way is much faster than using a spray nozzle. The Whirl A Way held up real well. I found that pulling it backward was the easiest. Moving side to side or pushing it forward took a lot more muscle."
1,DUMB,"THIS WAS SO BAD, I COULD NOT EVEN FINISH THE CD. IT MADE NO SENSE WHATS SO EVER. IT WAS ACTUAL PHONE CALLS TO A CERTAIN PERSON? GUESS IT WAS MY MISTAKE FOR ORDERING IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. I CANNOT BELIEVE IT WAS EVEN RECORDED."
2,Well..........Perhaps I Am Being Unfair But........,I gave this rating because I really expected this video to have more actual belly dancing I suppose. I was not too enthused but kept watching as a few woman spoke of their experiences as a belly dancer. The women spoke of their joy for belly dancing and how even after scarring received from operations in areas which would show in a regular belly dance costume they decided to expose them anyway. Had I known before hand that this was less on visuals of belly dancing itself I would not have purchased.
1,DO NOT buy this game!,"THIS IS THE WORST DRIVING SIM EVER TO BE SOLD IN THE HISTORY OF RACING SIMULATIONS, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, DO NOT WASTE YOURE MONEY, THERE ARE BY FAR MUCH BETTER GAMES THAN THIS ONE, PLEASE AVOID DOING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU COULD DO... HORRIBLE GRAPHICS, NO INCAR CAMERA, HORRIBLE GAME."
4,Product damaged,"This dvd was exciting and wonderful, in spite of the fact that it was damaged and had to be returned for a replacement."
2,Boring read,After reading other books on the assassination of Lincoln I thought this was a must read. Not so. Extremely boring. If I could get my money back I would.
1,The Lincoln Myth Lives On,"This book is the typical drivel intended to deify the 16th President. The title ""With Malice Toward None"" can be easily proven false by the simple fact that he (as a micro-manager of the War) condoned the attacks against civilians and the destruction and plunder of their private property. If the author had provided a true account of Lincoln's life, the title would have been ""With Malice Toward Many."" Lincoln basically made America safe for centralized government and big government spenders who delight in the squandering of taxpayer money. The present regime would be the utopia Lincoln yearned for. To this day, Lincoln remains the only president in American history to raise an army to attack his own people. I recommend ""War Crimes Against Southerners"" by Walter Cisco as an antidote to the nonsense in this book."
1,The myth malice toward none perpetuated,"Lincoln is hailed by the majority power as a god of sorts. For generations, writers like Oates and the majority's media that governs men like him, force upon students and citizens alike the myth shrouding Lincoln's cause of a union and economey controlled by a sectional, party, and central government system and censure it's true lasting effects.I read this book and was disapointed that the author's material was yet another rehashing of accumilated lore and soaked throughly with the author's own biased viewpoints and modern assosiation.You'll learn nothing different in this whole text than what you'd find in the Gettysburg Address. (A glowy version of one president's perfect storm)"
4,Trans-Siberian,This movie is a sleeper. The actors were outstanding and the plot moved in such a way it was hard to determine the movies' outcome. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes suspense.
5,A thriller!,"This movie was a true ""sleeper"". In the tradition of Agatha Christie's ""Orient Express"", a trans-siberian train ride is full of unusual (dangerous?) characters. The viewer will wonder if any of the characters in the train are who they appear to be. There is a business with drug smuggling, and the people we meet are not always what we think they are. There are assorted twists in this story, especially the one we find at the very end of the movie. All the actors do a great job in their roles."
4,I like Brad Anderson,"It's a solid film though not my favorite by Brad Anderson. That would be Session 9.AV quality on the disc is great. And if you like Brad Anderson, pick it up, it's cheap and worth it."
5,Refreshing,"Transsiberian is the newest movie from director Brad Anderson (Session 9, The Machinist). And just like his other movies, this one has strong characters, a compelling plot and an excellent soundtrack. While the premise of the movie seems to be nothing new or original its the storytelling and twist midway through that make this feature stand out from previous similiar movies. Its a shame that this movie didn't get a proper theatre run... but then again, a movie like this wouldn't appeal to a lot people because it relies much more on the story then mindless action or gore. Speaking of which, for some reason Best Buy stocks this title in the Action section... Clearly a drama/thriller flick. Highest Recommendation."
3,Starts so well but ends so poorly,"3.3 starsI really like how TS opened up, and it kept me focused until about an hour in, when it just started getting more and more predictable and standard, yet also patently unbelievable. All the nice character set-ups seemed almost for naught, and we even get a pointless torture scene to ratchet up the seen-it-all-beforeness.It's too bad, as the acting is good---Kingsley is as always near-perfect, and Woody is better than usual as a religious yokel---but the script just derails after a while like the train itself, and I just wanted the whole mess to end. The locales were gorgeously barren and snowy, though, and it's a well-shot film. Sadly, the plot just can't measure up to the photography or acting."
3,Not What I Expected,"I think Woody's character is what put me off. He was rather dense. The plot appeared fragmented. The preview made the movie look more exciting than it was. Definitely not an on the ""edge of your seat"" thriller."
5,"Fun, thinking game!","If you want a game that will make the hours fly, this is it. This game is a wonderful tool for encouraging creative thinking - as well as the capitalist spirit!One word of caution with the crayons (don't press too hard! They tend to break).Overally, however, this game is *Wonderful!* - I highly recommend it to anyone."
5,This Is A great Toy!!!!! By Marla .,This Is a great toy I think so if you saw my nighty nite jade review I am happy this is a great toy I don't get why some people think she is so ugly I don't agre well that is okay I used to think nighty gite Fianna was ugly at first but I adore Fianna and I'm getting this toy for my wish list with nighty nite Cloe
2,"I'm a Bratz Lover, but this is Sadly Disappointing","Fianna has never been so ugly before, and i got this doll for a birthday gift - her straps BROKE IN TWO SECONDS! I love her cool accessories, her pillow and her shoes. I keep her shoes in a cabinet. But the doll herself is a nightmare. I threw her out three months ago because the sight of her just sickened me out. Fianna has never looked so anorexic. Her hair is just horrifically ugly. I tore out her hair, and I burned her seductive card as well. I love her perfume, and i'm sewing new clothes for her myself. And I glued some new red hair fibres to her head - much better! Either way, don't get this doll for your child. instead, get the Tokyo a-go-go colector's edition mei lin, or one of the line of Bratz Candy or Sportz colection. anything that has entirely to do with fashion, i hate!"
2,Very disapointing,Im actualy an adult but it doesnt work so im reviewing on this. :-) well i would never buy this for my daughter i think bratz are too suggestive and a little to grown up for yougner girls. i like barbie alot better. for a 11 to 12 year old mabye but she would be to old to want to play with dolls by then. personaly i dont think bratz dolls are very good period. this is my opinion from a moms perspective not a childs and im sorry but bratz are just disapointing and me and my daughter dont find anything flattering about them.
5,im pissed,okay im pisssed at amazon becase they have bad pixs of all the dolls i mean like fix their hair show them in their other out fits here if you put fiannas hair back she looks ugly put some strands hanging around her face she looks nice and they should have put roxxis (twiinz set) hair around her face not just all put back and okay back to the doll she is nice but her hair is not really that blonde
3,Darker and more biting than other Gourds' CDs,"With their third release, ""Ghosts of Hallelujah,"" the Gourds rightly ascended to the zenith of the Americana genre and for that matter staked a pretty good claim for best American band in any genre.Chief songwriters Jimmy Smith and Kevin Russell ply their craft by again offering dark, funny, eccentric, odd, and vivid themes and lyrics that collide with some of the best ensemble playing of our times, all fueled by some gonzo muse that is best left unseen and only heard.This 1999 release saw multi-instrumentalist Max Johnson join the fray and his impact on filling out the band's sound cannot be underemphasized.It's hard to recommend one Gourds' CD over another, but this one seems a tad darker and biting than the others, is my least favorite of their sessions, and does not serve as the best introduction to the band."
3,Fun puzzles BUT...,"I really enjoyed the puzzles, but I agree with a couple of other reviewers that the letters are way too small and close together; it makes it very difficult and takes away from the fun. I liked the upper and lower case though; it provides extra hints. Had the spacing been more pencil friendly, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Great Animation/Action. Not for Kids,"Stock storyline and characters, great animation and action scenes, but be aware there's nudity. It's consistent with the other SST movies, but I wasn't prepared for it in a cartoon. This definitely isn't for kids."
2,very disappointed,"I like Sci-Fi. I really do. I even like animation, both the style of a Disney movie or Japanese anime. The problem I guess with this one wasn't so much as the story line, exactly, but rather the premise. I really think that if they had tried, it should have been live action but then .....So, my recommendation is this. If your really, really, REALLY bored, go ahead and watch it."
3,starship troopers,"The movie was so so . It was more like a video game with dull characters. You cannot invest in the movie. Cg may be the coming thing, but until the writing is up to snuff,it will still be mediocre. sorry"
4,Good CG,"I liked this movie, a little more true to the books and the cg is amazing. It is Worth watching"
2,Seriously?,"Really? CGI nudity? Is this really necessary? It wasn't even nudity done well! I'd kind of hoped that they would drop this aspect when they went CG, but I think they actually invented ways to put it in. Bad language, too. Really wasn't needed. The animation wasn't great. CG always has problems with eye expressions and this was really bad. Mouths didn't move realistically with the words. The overall plot was okay, but I think a live action movie minus the nudity would have served this version much better. Boo!"
3,Funny,Good animation. Definitely not what we expected but it was a decent movie. Wish it had been real actors instead of animation. The campy feel of the original does not translate well in animation.
3,"There were bugs, bombs & boobs...it delivered the goods.","Was exactly what I thought it should be. No more, no less. Bought it from instant for five bucks & think it was worth exactly that."
4,Pretty good anime.,"I was a bit worried about this one, since the previous numbered sequels were ... not so good. However, this sequel/spin-off was actually pretty good. The pacing is a bit hectic, and the dialogue is dumb, but it was still a fun movie. I can recommend this film for anime and Starship Troopers fans."
2,frustrating,"It is frustrating that one cannot rely on the product's information. The manufacturer's description states:""Strainers included"", yet the sink came without any strainers. The sink may be good such as, however it is desirable that one knows exactly what is being purchased and not to be unpleasantly surprised later. Therefore, my shopping experince with this product was not a positive one."
5,It's been a long time since R.E.M. sounded like this!,"As its name implies, ""New Adventures"" is something you haven't heard before from R.E.M.. In this album, Stipe and the fellows abandon their old style of music, and try to reinvent it. They tried to carry out the same thing on ""Monster"", but that was a very unsuccessful attempt. ""New Adventures"", in contrast to ""Monster"", is a beatiful album, with a wide variety of music styles. It more or less sums up R.E.M.'s work throughout the years. There are songs which contain elements of R.E.M.'s early work like ""Document"" and ""Murmur"", while others are more similar to the Grunge songs in ""Monster"". Actually, ""New Adventures"" contains elements of almost every album R.E.M. has released. The result is a great, original rock album, one of R.E.M.'s best creations."
3,Mediocre Effort From REM,"NAIHF is average in every way. The songs just don't click. It's like REM is trying to blend Monster with Automatic For the People. I love REM but many of these songs just irk me. Wake up Bomb is a good example. Undertow is another. More songs that bug me are #'s 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13. In my opinion, the only high points of this album are Bittersweet Me (and even this song aggrivates me sometimes) and Binky the Doormat. Binky is a great example of REM at its best. Boo yeah. U2 blows REM away, and thats all i have to say about that"
5,"Definitely Different, But Beautifully Balanced","I agree with a previous reviewer that Hi-Fi is a hybrid of Monster and Automatic for the People, but I think that it results in a terrifically balanced album. Electrolite and New Test Leper are excellent ballads while Departure and So Fast, So Numb are great rockers. This record was considered a failure for REM as far as sales are concerned, but I think it is in the Top 5 of REM discs."
5,a fine read,"When I made the commitment to earn my PhD in philosophy, my aspirations were almost identical to those of Mr. Phillips. After 3 years as a university professor, I can attest that the path he took is the path I should have taken. This book of his is the book I hoped to write myself. The only way to write a book like this is to chuck the security of academia and throw oneself into the world, engaging with people everywhere, with humility and curiosity, and methodical rigor, as Mr. Phillips has done. This book is revelatory at many levels, and my hat is off to Mr. Phillips."
1,wal-mart anyone?,"I have 2 of these to store camping gear, works fine and very happy with but the latches will rust very easy (mine is not stored outside but have gotten wet due to gear). Would recommend but wal-mart has these for $15 dollars or so why pay more and deal with shipping?"
4,good value for money,"a donated a couple of these plus a couple jr models for kids who were not going to get many presents - these are quality balls with a realistic feel to them - they're not pro quality at all - but i think they're a good value, i've had many over the years and was pleased with this purchase"
2,Pretty bad overall,"It was fun to throw around for the five weeks it lasted. The rubber is falling apart right along with the seams. This is a (now) $13.00 item that will cost $11 to warranty (shipping), if they decide the defect is their fault, that is. So, I'll play with it until it finishes decomposing and trash it. I guess I shouldn't expect much for the $14.95 I paid on Amazon but I haven't treated it badly. I just play with it in the back yard like my soccer ball, basketball, etc. Oh well."
1,Crappy,I purchased this football in 05/11 and have used it on less than 5 occasions only to play catch in my yard with friends and never in any football game. It already has 2 tears in it and looks like it's about to give birth. I wouldn't buy this unless all you want to do is look at it.
1,Leaks Air!,"Doesn't this company check their product before shipping it out! It's not ""LIKE NEW CONDITION""! Went flat within 5 minutes!"
3,its ok,It is great in size if you are really looking for big football. Whatever yu do do not leave it in the rain
3,More like progessive breaks...,I give it 3 stars from a prog. house point of view. There's no arguing that Diggers' has it going on but this is NOT a progessive house album. A few tracks lead you towards it but then leads right back to prog. breaks.It you want progessive breaks then you will totally love this. Personally breaks feel slower to me - not that I haven't danced my ass of to some great break sets at desert parties - but Layered 1 CD 2 has my vote.RE: the downtempo - it's good but if you're looking for some great chill go to Kruder & Dorfmeister. I plan on trading LS2 in.
2,Kindle version review,"Although available for the kindle, I do not suggest it. I bought it for my iPad, thinking the pictures would be quite good. Truth is, the quality of the pictures is very poor, and small. You can click on them to make them bigger, but they only become slightly larger, and are extremely pixelated., negating the major point of this book.This is one prime example of why some books just do not work in the electronic medium.Buy the bound book only. Buying the kindle one is like flushing money down the toilet."
3,"Unfortunately, it arrived with dents and peeling decals","The scooter runs fine, had all its parts and was in working order. I was disappointed that it had dents in the metal (although the box it arrived in was fine) and the decals on the floor board were peeling off. If it hadn't been so close to Christmas, I would have returned it. I just figured that over the years it will be dented anyway but it was a disappointment."
4,Great Scooter Kids Love it,"This is an awesome product. However buyer beware, Amazon ships it in it's original carton, which is flimsy. The first scooter I recieved was visible damaged through the box destroyed in shipping.Amazon exchanged it with no problem; however, the second box faired better, upon opening there were scratches everywhere. Other than that the scooter last about an hour with a full charge, folds down for storage and is great for my two older children."
5,Great ride for the price!,"Product was easy to assemble and get up and running. Daughter loved it and actually goes faster than I though it would. Seems to be a great product, especially for the reasonable price. Only negative is that the box came mangled from UPS and the throttle assembly housing was cracked exposing two wires. Did not notice the cracked piece at first. Called RAZR and they sent me a new throttle assembly."
5,A clear and concise dictionary of epidemiological terms,"I purchased this dictionary while reading for my masters degree in public health and found myself using it on an almost daily basis, particularly when working on my thesis. As other reviewers have pointed out, many of the terms used by epidemiologists are still evolving, and this dictionary does a great job explaining their meanings in a clear manner. It also implicitly cautions against committing common errors found in the literature (for example, the term ""rate"" is often incorrectly used by epidemiologists to refer to proportions despite the fact that they contain no units of time). All students of epidemiology and public health should own this book."
5,awesome concert,"i bought this dvd based on the two previous reviews. they did not mislead me, this is an awesome concert, i am so glad to have purchased it, i watched it through twice at first sitting. i grew up in LA in the late 60's and never saw Love live and have always regretted it. this is as close as i will ever get to doing so, and to tell the truth, today's version is AOK++ by me. how they put this band and orchestra section together must be a story in itself. arthur lee + dedicated rock musicians (guys you hit the note so very well, thank you) + dedicated horn section (you blare so well, thank you) + dedicated string section (you string so well, thank you) = one for the ages (you all have gifted us, thank you). thank you all! i also want to say that the production and editing of this concert is top notch. i can't recommend this dvd highly enough. arthur, you rock!"
4,Good Crafting Glue Gun - Recommended,"Length:: 0:17 MinsThis Surebonder ""Dual Temperature Full Sized Glue Gun"" is a good replacement for an older (different manufacturer) model we had in our shop. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Takes Full Sized Glue Sticks; useful since we use our glue gun for production in my wife's small business+ High\Low Setting; useful for bonding a wide range of materials with different temperature rated glue sticks+ Full Sized; fits my big hand well and large trigger gives good control+ Stable Base; prevents tip overs+ Includes Stand With Drip Plate; useful when used on ""High"" setting to catch glue blobs+ Built-In Stand; also has built-in flip down standCons -- Will tend to drip on ""High"" setting, but not much of an issue on the ""Low"" stetting or when using the included standOverall, I am very pleased with the features and value of this glue gun.Recommended!CFH"
5,Very scholarly historical book on witchcraft in Europe.,"This book made me feel so bad for people who lived in Europe during the witch craze. I now understand why this period and before it were coined ""The Dark Ages."" This is an example of what happens when people ignore objective reason, and are ruled by superstition. This is a must read for anyone interested in Medieval history, Christianity, and of course Witchcraft. If you are looking for some kind of spell book or anything else dealing with modern occultism, this is not the book for you. But if you want to see about how insane people and whole societies can become when superstition rules supreme, then this book hit's the nail right on the head. This is not so much a book wrote by an author's opinion, but instead a collection of lots of documents of witchcraft and it's punishments during this period."
3,Cardassia needs tighter but Andor better,These two novelletes are entertaining and give the dedicated ST reader more background on both planets. The Cardassia part however is not as well written and feels loose. The Andor is better.
2,Boring...,"I'm a fan of all Star Trek, through and through---but I have to say that this book bored me to tears. Each time I picked this one up I fell asleep. I tried again and again, but just couldn't get into this book (either story). I'm a HUGE fan of Andrew Robinson's ""A Stitch in Time"" and I think Cardassian stories have the potential to be great (that book reminded of the old Jack Vance novels about the Knume).I'll pick up the Trill and Bajoran stories (I loved the additional insight into Trill society we found in ""The Lives of Dax"". Hopefully they won't be as boring as this one...Now that Enterprise has been canceled, it's up to writers and fans to keep all of these stories alive and kicking. Let's make them good so that fans feel engaged!"
2,Not one of Ann's best,"This is compilation of older stories Ann has already published. I've met Ann when I worked for Marion County Circuit Court, she was in the courtroom during the I-5 Bandit's Habeas Coupus hearings (Randy Woodfield). She's a wonderful person and I admire her. I've read every single book she's published and no complaints. This is a hodge-podge of other stories you may have already read. A bit disappointing."
2,Not what I expected,The company listed book as good. Most of the time I receive books in very good condition. This time I received a book that was in well worn condition and had been withdrawn from a public library.I complained to the seller and he sent me an Amazon gift certificate to reimburse me for my cost. I know ratings are subjective and I really appreciated the seller reimbursing me for my cost.Good company to deal with. I might try them again.
3,music is ok even though i dont listen 2 that genre of music.,"i was messing around on the computer and i saw this ugly guy on a cd cover.so i checked it out cuz i remember he was claire danes boyfriend.listened 2 some samples and i sorta liked it even though id prefer the music i normally listen 2 like mxpx,new effects,etc."
1,"pain, fear, confusion...","my ears are fine by my EYES. MY EYES ARE BLEEDING, BEN. this album should be sold with a censorship sticker over the entire cover to spare us all the horror that is the breathing tornados album art....are those cheerios?"
5,Ben strums again! Another gem for the kid from Australia,"I saw Lee last night at Joe's Pub in NYC. I've seen Nirvana, the Beasties, and just about every other ""major"" rock artist this decade. Nobody holds up against Ben Lee. His sincerity and infectious pop hooks make for the most gratifying Rock N' Roll I've ever heard. He's a bit more ductile. Only Belle and Sebastian come close to matching the quality of his music. Oh, the album...Breathing Tornados is great. If Ben's band reads this I just want to say hi to Nina the keyboard player. She's gorgeous. Nick"
2,I miss the old JDG,"I have all of Jimmie Dale's CDs and I love his unique voice. But despite repeated listenings, this CD just didn't do it for me, and in fact, none of his last few CDs have satisfied me. His two best CDs are ""Fair & Square"" and his self-titled CD. Those are real, old-fashioned honky tonk and remain among my favorites of all time. While this CD marks a return to real country (his latest albums weren't country in my book), the songs just left me flat. Having said that, I'm obviously in the minority with my opinion."
4,Nice Poster,The price and size was a bit disappointing but it made a great gift and my dad was happy with it.
2,Cheap components,"This will be brief, as I'd like to limit the amount of time I've wasted as a result of buying this dog. I've had quite a few problems with mine, the latest of which is a DVD drive which falls out of DMA mode and thus can't playback DVDs properly. This is a cheap, consumerish machine, not something you should trust your media and data to. The included graphics processor is too weak to even handle high definition video playback."
4,Haynes Repair Manual,"This Used Manual is in good condition, was delivered when promised, and was good value for money. The contents were as expected from previous Manuals and give me all the facts I require to maintain my vehicle. Well satisfied with the purchase."
4,eYaargh!,"Reviewers below complain that Pirate Hunter is too slow, but that's the life of authentic sailors, boyo! The wind programming in this game reproduces all the frustration encountered in sailing into weather with a square rig, and it's just part of the pirate skill set that one must master! If the wind is wrong, a tiny skiff will outsail a giant ship of the line and there's nothing that can be done. The graphics are rich, and the experiences varied enough that plenty of fun, and booty, are to be had!"
4,The Midwife,I enjoyed reading this book as it was based around historical events. The author did very good research on the history of midwifery in early Russia. I have since read the follow up book The Midwife Advice and again enjoyed the historical facts of Jews in New York and women's rights in the early 1900.
1,FAKE ARMANI PERFUME,This product is fake.I have another bottle of Armani Code perfume here bought at Macy's and the scents are definitely different.The packaging is damaged (the wrap on the bottle) and the logo font is incorrect (too thin) and the bottle has different tinting than the original.
1,Dissapointed,"I am really dissaponted not for the product that is an axcellent women fragance, but form the provider( Perfumania). I did not received the product at all and I tried to contact them several times and I had any response. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift so I had to bought it at a local store. Finally I contacted Amazon and they proceed to reimburse my psid order. Amazon have to consider to unsubscribe this provider from their associated sellers list."
5,Great Purchase on Armani Code,"I love Armani Code and this is the best price by far that I have found online. Why pay high prices for Armani when you can get it right here from this reputable seller. GREAT, AWESOME product!"
1,Fake!!,This product is a fake!! Don't buy it! I just got it and i'm very dissapointed!! Anybody could tell this is not orginal. The brand name on the parfume is barly visible. Very dissapointed!!!!!!!
4,Amazing scent - but know what youre buying,"This perfume is the fragrance for me. Complex, sexy, brings to mind a woman who is graceful but volatile. Me!I dislike musks, or powdery, or very sweet, or very floral fragrances, and Armani Code is none of those things to my nose.Many women have commented that it is too heavy for their liking, or for day wear. I don't agree that it is heavy. I do agree that this perfume is so elegant, sensual and complex, I will mostly reserve it for evenings.Love it.EDIT: This scent is still amazing, but it doesn't last!!!! you really have to drown yourself in this one to smell it on yourself. Bummer."
5,I have never loved a scent as much as this one!,"I received the 2.5oz bottle of Code by Armani as a gift on my birthday, AND another one for Christmas. Two different occasions and from 2 different people. Serendipity had it: I had finally found a perfume I would stick with. The mixture diffuses a very agreeable and attractive smell that screams ""femme(woman)!"" but I do not find it to be girly-girly. The scent is not ""agressive"" at all for lack of a better word. It also helps that just a few sprays are all that one needs for a scent that lasts all day. As a woman in my late 20s, I find that this perfume complements what I strive to be like: simple yet distinguished; sweet but yet strong; self-assured and determined but yet light-hearted and happy :o)!"
5,First time i saw this..,"The first time i saw this i was with my mom and my friend,we were at target when we were looking in the dolls isle and my mom saw it and said ""this is cut"" but the thing is that i thought it said naughty nite no nighty nite so i was like what? then she pointed out the name and i finally got it right."
3,Picture is deceiving!,"Unfortunately the picture on the website does *not* match what you get. It's still a decent (though not great) seat, and better than the one currently on my mountain bike! Would not recommend this seat for men, only women, as the center groove is practically missing. Had a bit of difficulty mounting it as the mechanism was different than the one on the bike that I'm working on. Had to disassemble it and then reassemble using the old seat's parts. Wish Amazon had had a picture of the mounting mechanism..."
3,"cute, but thin","nice, cute shirt, but it is pretty thin, it come in a nice box for mailing, which makes it great for a gift, but it is a bit overpriced."
5,order one size up,Runs fairly accurate but you should order a size up. my daughter is 2 yrs old and i bought a size 4 and it would work on her right now.great shirt!
2,Stated new; clearly used,"As far as the shears themselves go, they are very nice. I would say they are worth the $20 or so that I spent. I ordered them from Amazon, and it states that they are shipped by Amazon and that the condition is new. Well, the shears that I was shipped are clearly used. They have gashes in the blade and scrapes all over the inside of the handle. This is a concern, as I wouldn't mind used ones if I hadn't paid for a new set."
3,"Good Pruners, BUT.......Bad Locking Mechanism","These pruners work great, feels very comfortable, and is very smooth when cutting. But it is true regarding what an earlier reviewer indicated. The locking mechanism once open will not go back into the closed position. I had to remove the locking mechanism and grind it down a bit so that it will close.It works great now, but I should not have to grind down the mechanism right out of the box."
3,Too big,"These look like great pruning shears, however they are not designed for people with small hands. I have used them with two hands so I know they cut well. I'm going to keep them as a present for a good friend (with larger hands), that would love to have them."
1,Failed in one day of use in my orchard,"I purchased Fiskars 9124 Professional Bypass Pruning Shears based on good reviews in Amazon, but it failed after I finished pruning two rows of trees in my orchard. The upper blade has become completely dull and I had to replace it with another one. Very disappointed."
1,Not what I thought I was buying,"Warning: If you think you are buying the audio Bible study sessions that go along with the workbook, do not buy this set!!! I bought the CDs and workbook, thinking I was going to sink my teeth into another wonderful Beth Moore study, and boy, was I disappointed! Other Beth Moore CD sets are audio versions of her videorecorded Bible study sessions. Those series capture not only the text, but the enthusiasm with which Beth Moore shares her message. I thought that's what I was getting. Instead, what I have is a narrator who is not Beth Moore reading the book version of this title, not the study itself. I also bought the workbook that goes along with the Bible study sessions. Now that I've opened the shrink wrap to listen to the 30-seconds that told me I had the wrong CDs, I can't return the set. I've wasted my money on both the CD set and the workbook. Please don't make the same mistake I've made!"
2,Not for serious students,"""To Live is Christ"" is a very poor textbook with only the most superficial of analysis. The writer seems unwilling or unable to probe deeply into the persona of Paul, his experiences or his ministry. Due to this lack, in my opinion, ""To Live is Christ"" is totally unworthy of graduate or even basic undergraduate study but is best left to Sunday School study by those who do not require or want much depth from their books."
4,Great Debut,"This album was released in 1978 and is their best album with David Lee Roth. The opening song is Runnin with the devil, which is in my opinion has the best backup vocals from eddie and michael, the 2nd song is Eruption, there are no vocals, just an amazing guitar solo from Eddie, the 3rd song is originally sung by roy orbison, which is called oh pretty woman. The song Jamies cryin is a great song to, but alex van halen said that is his least favorite song in the entire song catalog"
3,Overrated!,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is an overrated album by an overrated band. Now let me say that it IS good...just good, not great. Many people credit Eddie Van Halen as some kind of guitar pioneer....the nicest thing I can say is, ""Eddie Van Halen overused a technique that no one had ever overused before.""Having said that, I must say that ""Running With The Devil"" is BORING, and ""Jamie's Crying"" just falls flat. However, ""You Really Got Me"" and ""Ain't Talking 'Bout Love"" are pretty kicking tunes.Eruption is O.K. I guess. Eddie's playing doesn't have much emotional resonance for me. He seems to concentrate on speed too much, without really FEELING it. He succumbs to the ""LOOK AT ME"" urge way to often. I much prefer Gilmour, Page, Hendrix, Gibbons, Clapton, Beck, or even someone like Peter Buck!So yeah, it is overrated. But some people seem to really like it...Peace to all who read this, and to all who don't, Shovelmonkey"
5,The Album that Changed Rock n'Roll,"This is the Album that changed rock n roll. Every song on this album is pure energy and all balls(except ""you really got me"" don't care much for the cover).What followed this album are a bunch of imitators (like em or not), and influenced a generation of guitar players.This album is a must have for rock fans and guitarist."
4,"I hated it, but couldn't resist it!","You know you've been impacted by something when you never forget it.Well, I was in David Jenning's room way back when, when he told me about this group that was an opening act, but which stole the show from the headliner. . .it was VanHalen. I'd been spoiled by the textures and moods and architecture of the music of Led Zepplin. I didn't see the need for another band! When David Played VH for me, from my gut I thought, ""if this is where music's going, let me out."" But then came that urge to hear them again, and again, and the desire to know what that guitar player was doing (the finger tapping thing).You hear Eddie, you know it's him. He's a seminal artist, and he did it all with a piss poor rhythm section. I can only wonder what Eddie might have come up with if he'd had a decent drummer and bass player. Rock on, Ed."
5,The Soundtrack of my Youth!!!,"How many times did I hear this album as a teenager, cruising around town, probably up to no good like any good teen should be? Too many to count. Simply put, this is one of the greatest rock CD's ever, and its short length just makes it all the more powerful. Of course many staples of classic rock are here, but it's songs like ""Atomic Punk"" and ""On Fire"" that make this the greatest guitar album, along with ""Are You Experienced,"" ever released. Eddie Van Halen deserves induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame based on this album alone, as it has inspired countless numbers of wannabe guitarists. Van Halen never was much for social commentary, but these partying anthems still sound great blasting out of my car speakers. Most of the time now, I'm not looking to get in trouble when I'm driving around with this CD, but I can pretend can't I?"
4,Auspicious Debut,"This is a groundbreaking Heavy Metal debut from this party hearty band. Eddie Van Halen alters the style of hard rock guitar playing with his numerous whammy bar effects and dive bomb noises. Eruption is a frequent guitar solo played by many guitarists of other bands during the course of a concert. Outside of that Ice Cream Man, Running With The Devil, You Really Got Me, Janie's Crying, and Aint Talking About Love will always go down as hard rock classics. Little Dreamer and Feel Your Love Tonight are somewhat hidden gems. And I forgot to add what charisma on the part of that David Lee Roth character. This is one of the first three Van Halen discs to get."
1,Did not have a chance....,"I did not have a chance to see whether it performed well or not, because it worked only for about 15 minutes.... While the turn-table is still working, the mixer is dead...."
4,Temple fun!!!,Why do they call this a toy? I wear this to shul every shabbos to cover my head before G-d. I've never had so much fun in worship before. I'm buying these for all my fellow congregants.Even the Rabbi wants one!
1,"Beware, don't buy from ""lady_college""","Beware, don't buy from ""lady_college"". My experience was very disturbing. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever. Emails were not even acknowledged. Textbook ordered August 14, 2010 has not been shipped. To top it off, a status was not provided nor were emails answered. Pay $2 more and get your books and better service."
2,Disappointing,"Fraya Graffham is a likeable protagonist. Unfortunately, we can't spend much time with her because the narrative shifts from one to another of multiple characters' points of view, making it difficult to develop empathy for any of them. We are forced ""into the mind of a killer,"" a hackneyed, unpleasant device for readers who enjoy a murderer's gruesome and perverted thoughts. Simon Serrailler gets lost in the pile of characters. Hill creates laughably villainous characters from the alternative health community: a psychic surgeon and spiritual counselor. Ostensibly, she attempts to balance them with an acupuncturist who defers to traditional doctors, who are dedicated and altruistic. This wouldn't have smelled so much like an agenda if Hill had, for instance, mentioned the yearly 72,000 deaths in the UK due to medical error, per the UK's Commons health select committee. All in all, conventional, stereotypical characters and plotting. I won't be getting another book by Susan Hill."
2,Not quite...,"I was so excited about this book, after I read the reviews. The book flows well, but leaves the reader hanging. It really is not a mystery or crime novel, because although, crime does happen, the ending hangs. The bad guy is not caught, there is not closure. I guess this probably reflects real crime situations, but we read these books to get away from 'real crime' and find some measure of justice. You will not find this in this book. I will try the 2nd novel to see if it is any better.I would not recommend this book."
2,Too much detail not enough story,"The most interesting character was the killer, the others just took up space. I don't usually skip over large sections, but the unnecessary descriptions slowed the storyline too much and I found myself skimming when I really wanted to be involved in the plot. I was minimally bored and just wanted to get it over with. Won't buy another from this author. Interesting title, though."
3,"Well written, but....","It was hard to tell that this book was about Simon Serrailler. The main focus was on a subordinate, whose character was well developed and about whom the reader can't help but care. The plot twist at the end left me feeling empty and not really ready to soldier on to the next book. I have to identify with and care about a character before I become engrossed in a series (take Inspector Morse or Richard Jury, for example). Serrailler didn't ring the bell for me. That said, I will read the next book to see if a connection with the protagonist is established."
3,Various Haunts of Men,"Never read this author before. Had killer figured out before end of story. May try next in series, but not sure."
5,NO SE LO DIGAS A NADIE...ES YA NO YA!,"NO SE LO DIGAS A NADIE, SIN DUDA UNOS DE LOS LIBROS MAS ENTRETENIDOS QUE HE TENIDO OPORTUNIDAD DE LEER.

5,A must Read BOOK....For All Audience,"One on the best book...comercially...ever written in Perú..recently adapted in a movie, shows a funny story about a guy trying to find his personality. It also Shows the night life of lima. Recoment this book for everybody interested in cool stories....everybody buys and sees the movie in Peru"
3,Jaime Bayly o el estilo aliterario,"El elogio de mi héroe Vargas Llosa me predispuso automáticamente en favor de este autor. En esta novela, con personajes y elementos perfectamente intercambiables con otros de ""Yo amo a mi mami"", Bayly trata con transparencia y asepsia un tema descarnado y, aun en una época que presume de su falta de pudor, escandaloso. Quizá su principal recurso literario sea precisamente la ausencia aparente de forma o intención literaria. Es una prosa minimalista, callejera, breve. Un estilo deliberadamente esquemático que es casi casi la negación de la literatura. Tan rompedor como el argumento mismo."
2,Watch Out for missing ports,"I recently purchased this machine. I found that the machine was well out together and have no real issue with the quality of the machine. I like the card slots and ports available on the front.However, when the machine was opened up I found that HP did not include any port to upgrade to a video card! Incredible, that this would be missing on a computer in this price range and perfomance.I also found that the power supply is only 250watts. For a pentium 4 class computer this is a cheap way to degrade an otherwise good design.If I had purchased a bargain basement computer from a local supplier I would have concluded I got what I paid for. This is not something I woud expect from a ""high end"" computer from HP.Had I known these issues existed I would not have purchased this model."
3,"Great entry level off the shelf computer, but read shortcomings below","I bought this computer from Fry's about a month ago and it's great for conventional applications, Media Center, etc... The problem I had with the computer was the upgradeability. Specifically the motherboard, which doesn't allow the later generation of graphics cards (PCI-E). So if you're looking for a computer that you'll be able to grow with this is not the one. I ended up taking the comp back and building mine from scratch, an accomplishment that isn't so hard these days. I miss the Media Center program but I'm a lot happier with a machine I can upgrade in the future."
5,The gift we keep on giving,"We received A Collaboration with Nature as a wedding present and have savored it now for 16 years. Used it as inspiration for a project as an art docent in the schools and have given it over and over to accolades to friends who are ""earth-linked"" as well. Art, humor, appreciation, and over-the-top sensitivity ... this is a book to be truly cherished."
3,not too shabby.,"while i bought this book for another, i find it to be pretty good. some pictures aren't up to todays digital quality, but its still great to look at. you won't be disappointed."
3,untitled,"andy goldsworthy shows what is right in front of you. nature is beautiful. he's added his own personally sensitivity to the medium of natural found objects, but the credit is due also to the objects themselves."
2,Firewood rack,"It's okay, looks better in the pictures. Very cheap construction and cover is near useless and tore immediately in the wind."
1,came already rusted and dented,"When I opened the box the rack was already rusted and dented in spots, I just packed it back up and sent it back. As always Amazon was great about refunding the money."
3,"Good firewood rack, but worthless cover","The firewood rack easily went together and holds firewood great. That part seems to be holding up well after about 2 cords of wood. The cover on the other hand has disintegrated in a couple months. It is made of very light plastic that is shredded by our typical northwest winter weather, especially when it is below freezing. Landmann needs to use a much better material for the cover. As it is, they are just contributing to disposable product problem that is fodder for land fills."
3,"flimsy, not sure why everyone like this","Metal tubing, narrow depth. After assembly the stand does not touch the ground at all points of rest, in fact my was warped upwards on one side. Load corrected the aforementioned. Tips easy. No kids, buy it. Have kids, hide it."
3,MISSING INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PUT TOGETHER?,Just received this package a day late. The box looks like someone opened it and taped the bottom back together. I'm missingg the instruction booklet. Not sure how to put the thing together now. :(
2,Average at best,"The Landmann fire wood log rack was average, at best. It is easy to put together, however the frame is not that sturdy. Worst of all is the ""cover"" they sent with it. After one decent storm with wind, the cover was torn into shreds. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Good rack, bad cover","The rack is sturdy and bolts together without difficulty. As other reviewers have noted, the feet are too narrow, so you will want to put down and level three 16"" PT 2x4 bases, but that's to be expected. The disappointment is the cover. It is thin plastic and will not last more than about a year. Get the rack, and then buy an 8x10 tarp for the cover.Update: the cover didn't even last two months. One moderately windy day and it was shredded."
3,Log rack,"Quick delivery. Great price! This log rack could be a little heavier built. It's okay for the price. I don't like buying anything sight unseen. I would recommend buying the 4 ft version of this product, although the center legs do well with supporting the weight of the wood. Now, if I could just get the wood stacked straight!"
5,log rack cover,Very well made and substantial. It is tight-fitting and did not blow off in a recent wind storm like the previous one I owned. The sections separated by zippers is a great feature as you don't have to uncover the whole eight foot rack to get wood.
2,Very unhappy with change in cover,I got another 8 foot Landmann firewood rack with cover and found that last year's substantial cover with zippers has been replaced with a flimsy vinyl cover that will not last through the first wind. The tie strings have already pulled out of the cover. I would return this whole rack if it wasn't already filled with firewood. Aaarrgghh!
4,works well,"We probably should have bought 2 since we have so much wood, but it does the purpose. I wish the cover fit a bit better, but I think it's due to our chopping skills--the logs aren't uniform."
4,It Works Fine,"This is a good product, extremely easy to assemble, lightweight but sturdy, and fully up to the task of storing a fairly large amount of firewood.Its only drawback is that it is fairly narrow front-to-back and the feet are too small to stand stably directly on a dirt or grass surface -- the weight will make them sink in when the ground gets wet. It's easily wide enough to hold the firewood but if you don't stack the firewood carefully it will tend eventually to lean forward or backward even when it's set atop pavers, which you MUST do unless you put it on a hard surface like concrete. This might not happen if the feet were wider platforms and were flared out slightly to give it a little bit wider stance.But this is a good product at an excellent price and I actually bought a second one when I felled a tree and it resulted in my having too much firewood to stack atop the other."
5,"For ""Believe It or Not Fans""!!","This great collection of weird stuff is for both youngsters and big kids (too!) who are fans of the ""Believe or Not"" kind of stuff that will often surprise you.The author began this writing project after hearing about a smalltown museum that has two fleas dressed up like a bride and groom! (She found it, too!) She goes on to say that her favorite discoveries are the historical items: some Civil War soldiers were not men!; the post office once used camels for delivery! Then there's the man with the collection of 1,060 different air-sickness bags!Kids will love, of course, reading about the longest worm in the world.Chapters are organized by Animals, People, Places, Lifestyles."
4,Typically beautiful Tyner performances! 4 1/2 stars!,"Buy the album. The price is worth it. If you love McCoy's style of playing, then you will absolutely love this album. However, this is a terrific joy to listen to period. Both of the trio settings featured on this album form cohesive, tight units."
5,Gripping tale,"First I read ""Ride the High Waves"" by this writer, then I found out he's written a couple of crime novels. Neon Streets is really good. Good story, interesting characters, and it is chock full of things to think about. I recently moved, and after laboring to unpack, it was interesting sitting on a milk crate and reading this extraordinary novel."
1,Didn't care for it.,I didn't care much for this book. While it tries to follow the 'Plain People' lifestyle I don't feel this story did it justice. I still like Beverly Lewis and Wanda Brunestetter much better.
4,It was interestng from a little girls perspective growing up under an only child under a maiden aunt.,How people around us weave into our lives and sometimes we don't notice it.I likes how the patchowork quilt related to our lives
5,good book,"Patchwork A Story of the Plain People is about a girl who can't decide whether or not to stay plain or go into the ""real"" world. At 18 she goes to Philadelphia to study music and sees many things and places that she likes. At this point in the book, I still don't know what she will decide to do but if she wants to be true to herself I think she will decide to go back home and continue life as before; at least I hope so."
2,slow reading,"I love reading Amish Books, but this one is slow reading. I have not pickd it up in a few days, but read a hard cover Amish book in three days."
5,Ass Kicking Rock And Roll,When I had vinyl record albums this was my very first Van Halen Album. I played it so much I just about wore it out. This is One of Van Halen's finest. This is their third album and their best ever. The guitar lick at the beginning of And The Cradle Will Rock is awsome. Then it goes right into Everybody Wants Some with some great guitar work. My favotite song on the CD is Take Your Whiskey Home. Wow how we used to party to this song. All in All there is not a bad song on this CD. There are only nine songs but what a huge sound of great music. I like David Lee Roth better with Van Halen than when he sung solo. Van Halen is probably the best Rock & Roll Band Of All time in my opinion.
4,Classic Van Halen in their prime,"This is Van Halen possibly at their peak. The fights have not yet started. Vallerie Bertinelli wanted to meet Eddie after listening to the CD and seeing Ed's picture on the back. Cool guitar riffs, classic Dave one liners-""Have you seen Junior's grades?"" It seemed like the guys had fun with this one. It is oceans of laughs and reeks of mischief. On later albums with DLR the tone gets more pessimistic."
4,"...gimmie quad r,radar 7....mayday","the songs that i liked will forever classics,everybody wants some,and the cradle will rock,and loss of control. However i am yet to find another soul who enjoys the song loss of control. the other songs sound like songs sang in a pub,but the good songs are so good so it boosts my rating"
4,"A lot of ""fun"" songs...","""...And the Cradle Will Rock!"" is hilarious lyrically, as is ""Could This Be Magic"", which has that campfire-song feel to it. ""Everybody Wants Some! "" is great, the heaviest on this album, even though the riff is pretty simple. Still, I'm REALLY edging towards 3 1/2 or 3 stars for this CD, because it just seems a little thin in too many places, with some filler (""Tora!""/""Loss of Control"" = wtf?). In the end, though, it's not a bad CD by any means. But the guys have done better too."
3,"Has some filler, but still rocks hard","WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST the third album by VAN HALEN has the unlucky spot of being released by two classic albums VH1, AND VH2, and although this is a solid album, it doesnt come close to the greatness of the first two. This album does has some killer songs AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK, EVERYBODY WANTS SOME, TAKE YOUR WHISKEY HOME, COULD THIS BE MAGIC, IN A SIMPLE RHYME. The instrumental TORA TORA is also a good song. Its the other 3 songs, FOOLS, ROMEO DELIGHT, and LOSS OF CONTROL, that are the filler material on this album. This album still has some killer riffs and some awesome musicianship throughout, it just doesnt stand up well with the first two albums. I might be in the minority here, but I think the following album FAIR WARNING is a much better album than this one. I not saying you will not enjoy it, it is a solid album, it just lacks the power of the first two. It would still make a great addition to your collection"
1,Third time is not the charm,"They simply didn't have enough songs when they were to release another album for WB. Cradle will rock, and Take your whiskey home are the two tracks that may pass as songs. Loss of control, Tora Tora, Fools, look like loose jams with not enough to mature into a song. Dave recorded his yelling over Eddie's guitar in a way bearable only for Dave's inner circle. Eddie got his chops and mind together to unleash a new era of music for the band with the superb follow up Fair Warning."
1,"Mr. Van Halen, your diaper needs changed!","First of all, David Lee Roth is from Bloomington, Indiana, not New York as he claims. He worked at ""The GAP"" selling blue jeans. Too many of us know this. Secodly, Mr. Eddie, ""PLEASE STOP BORING US""! Now here is a real guitar player "" Orianthi""! I BELIEVE SHE ""ROCKS THE CRADLE"", AND THE CRADLE WILL ROCK""!"
5,More Beautiful in person,I got this lion for myself...to lay on my bed with my cats...he may seem a little pricey but for collectors its worth it..if your buying this for a small child to play with..id go with something cheaper....for this is a high end collectable plush lion....and it may not be sudible for small children pulling or tugging on it...but for us adults or older children who want a nice real look lion that is still huggable and soft and plush....You cant go wrong..B.W.
3,Different.,"Emma, like many children, has a very strange lovey. It's a rug.And that rug, with its fluff, is her inspiration for all the art she does, all the awards she wins that she doesn't care about.Until her mother washes it, and poor Emma is totally traumatized. I'm not sure if that scene is over-the-top or not, but the girl literally throws out all her pictures and stops talking in class. The happy ending comes when she sees she can get her inspiration from the world instead of the rug.I'm not sure what I think of this book, to be honest."
5,Gift for my boyfriend,"I bought these for my boyfriend last Christmas (almost a year ago now). He is a pizza delivery driver and wanted a way to keep his windows slightly open on rainy days so that he and the food wouldn't get soaked and so the food wouldn't fog up all of his windows. These worked, and still work, great! I'm actually really surprised that none of them have fallen off over the course of the past year and I'm very glad I bought them!"
4,Feels like home,I feel that Mr. Quintana catches the heart of chicanos. Reason being is becasue the stories that are in this book really hit home.
4,cute n simple,"the helmet fit my almost 3 years old perfectly. the only problem is the velcro on the elbow pads is not sew in nicely so it looks like it is going to fall off. otherwise my daughter loves wearing it. like she say, safety first:)"
3,Brings back childhood memories of songs,My mom taught me the words to Gofer Guts as a child and we used to sing it and be silly... this is a great thing to buy... let your kids be silly sometimes.... and hear them say ewwww it won't hurt them... just remind them they are songs... silly and gross but not real events....My daughter and I will enjoy these around a campfire for a long time....
3,Two Movies Produced Near The End Of The Series Before WWII,"BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S SECRET POLICE is a 1939 movie. Much of the action takes place in Drummond's ancestral home. John Howard is Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond and the cast includes Heather Angel, H.B. Warner and Reginald Denny.In BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S BRIDE Phyllis and Drummond are finally married. The film is based on Sapper's novel BULLDOG DRUMMOND AND THE ORIENTAL MIND. The cast includes John Howard, Heather Angel, H.B. Warner, Elizabeth Patterson and Reginald Denny."
2,Not for me,"I've read and enjoyed two other Robards books, which I would recommend over this one: ""Shattered,"" and ""Obsession."" She is a great romance author who knows how to write an engaging story. Unfortunately, this particular novel falls under that frustrating style of romance that was inexplicably popular in the 1980's: characters who hate each other, and yet inevitably fall into the sack together... Bleh. She made the characters so ornery and opinionated that they were too hard to love. Jack is tough, yes, but he is so mean to Clara that he comes across as a jerk. And Clara is tough too (in her own way), but her vindictiveness and inexplicable motivations make her equally impossible to love. Puff was fun, but even he wasn't enough to save this book for me. I put it down after page 157.It wasn't poorly written, and I will still recommend Robards as an author, but this particular novel was not for me.I suggest her more recent material, instead."
3,Disappointing,A few of the tunes were okay. The rest sounded more like a lounge at chain motel in a one horse town.
2,Great protection... Horrible Silicone,"DEFINETLY worth the investment in regards to protecting the phone. Dropped my 7105t several times and would have had to purchase a new phone but thanks to this nifty rubber slip on, no damage whatsoever. The only problem is that the silicone is really bad. I have maintained the rubber as best as i could but the silicone is rubbing and peeling off and making for a really nasty case. That is the only reason this product got a 2 star rating. Protection is GREAT! The quality of the product is REALLY poor."
5,Interesting and creative recipes.,I like this book for the mostly small quantity snacks. Other books that offer recipes for snacks are meant for 4 people or more.This little gem literally has recipes for 1 or two people. The recipes are healthy and uses ingredients that most people have in their pantry. Most of the recipes take about 15 minutes to make. This is definitely a book for the Foodie.It is a good read and filled with humor.
5,Should be on Every Bookshelf. A Hidden Treasure,"Whether or not you've heard of haiku -- this witty little book is loaded with wisdom. It's spiritual, uplifting and timeless. Should be on every bookshelf.I read this haiku to my yoga teacher:""While each mindHosts a universeEach soul waits alone.""When I answer my rebellious teenager, I think of this haiku:""Saying noBy describing the limitationsOn Yes.""Whenever I visit my ill friend, I remember this:""Pain is the screenThrough which truthCan be seen."""
4,"With Bon Scott singing, LET THERE BE ROCK!!!","Without a doubt, the most unique band out there. DBT is a collection of progressive rednecks that pay homage to the South and their favorite band, Lynyrd Sknyrd. This album is true to the title, it is a Southern Rock Opera. The story centers around a musician growing up during the golden age of rock, the 1970s. However, after the plane crash that killed Ronnie Van Zant (and Lynyrd Skynyrd), our protagonist (like much of the South) loses his music heroes and his direction. Hard to compare this group to another. They are certainly Southern rockers, but with a little punk mixed in. They are proud to be from the South, it might not be perfect, but it is home."
1,Don't ever use a KVM switch with high resolutions,"I had this set up with my 24"" monitor and it's destoying my eyes, it cannot withstand high resolutions despite it is stated on the box, very blurry, shadows by the edges , totally displeasant to read, I wonder if other switches in the market are like this , I cannot read on my screen with this one, very bad for the dlink"
3,Way too much to take in,"Well I just couldn't stick it out with these books. I had a total different expectation of these books then what they are. There is just very little forward movement and so many details to learn and lots of names to memorize! Geez, some of the people have three or four names and there is three different languages they could be talking in. There is also many different view points that the story is written in. I like that you know what everyone is thinking but the change is so quick, you have to really be alert to the changes because there is little to show you that the speaker or the mind you are hearing is changing. A little more complex then I was expecting. These are defanantley adult books, which I wasn't expecting either. I am familiar with Smith's young adult work and love it. I just didn't know these were not young adult and the writing not what I expected.There was so much talk about sex it completely threw me."
3,NAMES!,"I like what I have read so far, but the weird names of the characters are making me crazy. Not only are the names weird, but the author decides to give everyone nicknames too. I am having trouble following. I love fantasy stories but fail to understand the need for weird names. Example: Whipstick Noth, Dogpiss' older brother, and that is one of the normal names. Please authors don't make me work so hard to get into your story, many will give up. I am still deciding. On page 77 and still am only sure of who two people are, and they now have nicknames."
4,pretty good stuff,"i think the cd is pretty good. not my favorite but definitely up there. i still love ""my own worst enemy"" and i also like ""miserable"" and ""four"". they are awesome songs and i do recommend that you get the cd"
4,it rocks!,"~Lit's ""A Place in the Sun"" is a sweet CD. I just baught it for ""Miserable""...that song is fabulous. But there isn't a bad song on this CD. They are an excellent band have have totally proved themselves worthy of lasting star quality."
5,This cd will stick in your head for a LONG time!,"After I heard ""My Own Worst Enemy"",""Zip-Lock"",and ""Misrable"" on the radio I decided to buy this album since I thought they were pretty good. So when I went on a trip to Orlando I went to the Virgin Megastore. I listened to the whole cd before I bought it, and I thought it was great. I quickly bought it and then listened to it for 3 hours straight on the ride home. Every song on this cd is very catchy and will get you in a good mood. If you like Alternative, Punk, or Hardcore, then you might wanna check out this album."
5,Awesome CD!,"Lit has really done it this time- this album is awesome! I must warn you; a lot of the songs sound very similar, but they're all GREAT. I'm sure you've heard the overplayed ""My Own Worst Enemy"", ""Ziplock"", and ""Miserable"" (which is my favorite song- it really got me hooked on them). Anyway, those songs are great, plus ""The Perfect One"", ""Quicksand"" (Don't you love the middle of the song- ""When it starts sinking in, like Quicksand...), ""The Best is Yet to Come Undone"", and ""Lovely Day"". What the hell, they're all great songs! Another thing is that A.Jay Popoff has a great voice, and the music is definitely not HARD, if that's what you're worried about (but it's not too soft either...hehe) I hate it when other bands yell and scream in songs- it doesn't even sound like music! Lit isn't like that at all- Go out and buy the cd NOW!"
4,Total fun,"This is one great CD. There is no other way to put it! If you want something you can hop in the car, roll down the windows, crank up, and jam out to...than this is a MUST have CD. A friend introduced me to it and I bought it the next day. I think ""My Own Worst Enemy"" has got to be my theme song. If you enjoy Blink you will assuredly love these guys. Get the cd......period. You won't be sorry."
3,Good CD...But Not Great,"Everyone who is rating this CD with 5 stars is obviously talking about the song ""My Own Worst Enemy"" and didn't listen to the rest of the CD!! The songs ""Four"" and ""Miserable"" also get my vote as great songs, but the rest of the CD is full of mindless repetative songs (if they ARE called songs..they are THAT BAD!!). My advice would be to either tape those songs from the radio, or go to a friends house who has the CD and get the songs from them. It is NOT worth it to go and buy this CD. As for the Lit boys, I hope that your next album is better. Keep on trying guys!"
3,"Summer, big guitars and bigger hits","This CD says Summer! The CD screams summer music much like the Beach Boys did for their generation with sunny lyrics, big guitars for any pool party and even bigger hits like Four, Zip-Lock, My Own Worst Enemy, and Completely Miserable. It is good, but not great, because if you advance tracks and listen to each track for five seconds they all sound the same! It is very difficult to see which song is which by listening to them. Four has tight lyrics about certain feelings of staying and going with a girlfriend, he stays when he knows he should go. My Own Worst Enemy, everyone has heard it from Me Myself and Irine, starts with big guitars, before going into a great beat and good rock / pop lyrics and vocals. Completely Miserable is such a slow, rocking song and blatantly honest about the aftermath of a relationship. Another bad part is that this band sounds so much better live compared to this CD, which slows the pace of each song."
4,woooooooooohoooooooo,i love grunge punk what have you as long as it's not bubble gum and as long as the person can sing. lit rulez soooo much. they sound good ad they're happy you have to smile when you hear them. they rule i dont care what you think
1,This cd was a huge disappointment,"after hearing ""my own worst enemy,"" i was all pumped to hear the rest. but to my dismay the songs had no originality and i felt like burning the cd after song number 8. if you want to spend your money on something good, don't buy this cd."
2,Pretty good if you like that sort of stuff,Pretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuffPretty good if you like that sort of stuff
5,This Cd Has All The Good Stuff From Alternative And Metal,"My friend told me to download the song ""My on worst enemy"" on mp3 so i did and it was awesome it has a great guitar inro and it kicks . I thought that would be the only good song but all of them are good, especially, Happy, No Big Thing, My own worst enemy, A Place in the sun. This cd it one of the best I have ever bought. Buy this it is really worth it trust me! CHECK YOU ALL LATA"
3,"Great Soap, But the Worst Product Information Label I've ever Seen","Excellent natural soap... But the product label ""sucks."" Label font is too small to read creating great difficulty in finding/reading product information. My concern about this concentrated liquid soap product was, the recommended ""dilution ratio"" of soap to water. After spending 15min reading this entire (ridiculous) label, all that that was stated was ""Delute"" and so I conducted my own tests finding a satisfactory dilution ratio. The entire label is covered with inappropriate and (irrelevant to the product) religious messages. Without a doubt, the most ridiculous product label I've ever seen, and not consumer friendly."
2,Didn't like it,"I had a couple of recipes that recommended this soap as a bubble bath base. I tried it and wasn't at all happy with the results. Although it says unscented, it has a smell that reminded me of my grandfather and left a white film on the bubbles and in the tub. If you're at all averse to preachy people, don't read the label, either. I don't know who Dr. Bonner is but the label is more high pressure than any Mormon or Jehovah's Witness missionary ever thought about being."
3,Subjects are mere temperment at a prone,"There has been skeptic of Johnson & Johnson, views having fear of the dirty head. I believe that having been dropped on my head here, fostering a fond sense of using soap digging latently until now. Care for the surrounding and yeah baby powder might of done that in the mix, I hope so. |Keeping you informed, Amazon users| Note: Organic might have its edge and neigher patent creater nor catagory, looks good for after searching at first query. I was shunned somewhere for almost getting a baby in the eyes with the baby powder, this is why common soap should not be seen under hemp inclusion. Wounld prefer cucuumber to rosemary in the organic brands."
5,love it,"after a lot of research finally got this body wash and its great, just love the way it smells and cleans my baby"
2,Not his best,"I'll admit that Paul was never my favorite Beatle. Far from it, in fact, but I always liked his music. However, this album is just badly put together. The booklet is full of typos and his vocals are not the best I've heard from him. Somehow, the whole album just comes across as something he did one afternoon while bored out of his mind.Pass this one up, unless you're truly a Paul fan."
4,title,"heard the words, saw the man on sat.tv from england. could not believe he was covering such old dusties,but I never moved off the chair. the engery was unreal.this is a mark of a true artist which is why paul still gets them up and dancing!"
1,Personal Agendas Response,"Just remember mate, some of us all don't have personal computers and have to share like a group of fans from Macondo here....look at the differnet reviews from the same PC and you'll notice some differing views and some not so differnet....just because someone doesn't rate 5 stars doesn't mean you have to post something like personal agenda...."
5,Thank God for Rock and Roll and Paul McCartney,"Genius is an over used word to describe so many and most are not genius. But missing links and along comes Paul McCartney, who sometimes needs to prove that he is still the man and yes a GENIUS."
1,Recycling and knighthood - unsatisfactory combination,"I had not bought a Paul McCartney production for a long time. I was intrigued by his latest disc, and ordered a copy. Imagine my disappointment to learn that one of the all time most talented men of music was recycling songs from my pre-teen years, and that he did not do as good a job as the original ""artists."" What a shock to know that Sir Paul cannot sing as well as Ricky Nelson! What is the world coming to? Would Ricky be Sir Ricky if he had lived?"
1,"Let it Be, Paul","Now Paul is going through his bad Buddy Holly phase. Give it up, let it be Sir Paul. Your once great talent is gone and this useless album proves it. You are rich and old and you need to get off that long winding road. Don't you feel the least bit of shame for recording this sham. John,was so right years ago, nobody likes your elevator music.I loved the Beatles and have everything they recorded. That's why it hurts so badly to listen to this tripe."
1,No better than a manual brush,"Don't waste your money. It's a gimmick. A standard tile brush was faster and easier than the SonicScrubber. For the scrubber to work, you need a stream of water to ""lubricate"" the dirt. Every time I pick up the SonicScrubber to use it, I get bored after 10 seconds and reach for a brush."
4,A pretty solid read!,"It was a pretty good book. I liked the main character (Joe Green)well enough, and, at the time, I could sympathize with him as near the middle-end of the book we get the grown up version of him. He seems to be a person at an age where he's not sure where he wants to be, feels to old to be in his profession but he also still has a passion for it simmering under his age. None of the other characters really stand out except for his two main love interests. Also, like most people after reading the book, I dug up my Smiths cds. Great for a Smiths fan.Hairstyles of the Damned (Punk Planet Books)and it reminds me a lot of this book as well, which I adore."
4,Gleim CMA Review,"I passed all four parts of the CMA exam, plus the CFM part 2, all on the first try using the Gleim review. I found it to be a thorough review. The actual exam is harder than the practice tests in the book, though. The exam has changed since I took it. While I can't comment on the new test, I believe Gleim puts out a quality product and I assume they've updated their materials as well. Most CMA's I've talked to use Gleim products to study."
2,poor quality,Very disapointed with quality of these chubbies. The plastic is thinner than in the past and several cars do not latch like they should. Made cheap. I will be returning them and looking for an older more durable set on Ebay. Shame on Viking Toys!
4,The musical equivalent of a Tim Burton film,I stood there and listened to the whole CD.It's strange and dark but not inacessible. Each song has some cool surprises in it.
5,As Our Parents Age,"As book 2 of the 4 volume Crosswick Journals, The Summer of the Great-Grandmother remembers and reflects on the last summer of L'Engle's mother's life, spent at Crosswicks, their family home in a small New England village. It is titled ""...Great-grandmother..."" because that summer there are 4 generations living in the Crosswick house. Anyone who has cared for or even been present as a parent ages and dies, will relate to L'Engle's range of emotions and her ups and downs in her faith. I absolutely recommend you read all four of the Crosswick Journals,A Circle of Quiet, The Irrational Season and Two-Part Invention, but each of the volumes can be enjoyed on their own."
1,THIS CAMERA BREAKS,"I had this camera for less than two years when it stopped working. I treated this camera like a baby, so it should have lasted for a long time. They would charge me $115 to fix it - and then that is only guaranteed for six months. Minolta customer service told me that it is the nature of mechanical things to break and I happened to get one that broke. Do not buy this camera unless you want to buy another one next year."
2,Great singer but badly mastered CD.,"Ruth Brown is original, unique and super! But the mastering on this CD doesn't do her justice. The orchestra is LOUD while Ruth's voice is scarcely audible way in the background! The orchestra blares away and Ruth is barely there. You have to strain to hear her. What was somebody thinking? Get this recording but try to find a different version -- the CD I'm describing here is by ""Garland."""
3,Too hard to believe,"I managed to finish the book so it gets 3 stars. It starts out interesting with accounts of managed care abuse that are believeable and is the author's territory. Then it shifts into fast action, guns and bad guys, with the main character, a surgeon, becoming the hero, overpowering and outwitting professional killers.Read the third paragraph of booklover10's review above. It's right on target.Since this was my first book by this author I hope to find a better one from earlier in his career."
3,It's a love thing,"My daughters bought me Keith Urbans Cd of Christmas, and I was thrilled! It's a love thing is one of my all time favorite songs, and makes me feel good listening to it.I've listened to the cd several times now, and enjoy most of the songs on it. I think it is a great cd for having never heard of him before, and he can only improve with time.Laura Baughman"
4,The Caboolture Kid-I used to be your Drummer!,"Hi there!I have been trying to contact this guy for the past 12 months.Hi Keith, if you read these reviews???Remember me? I'm Phil Cox, I played drums for you for about 15 months while touring around Queensland etc! I played for a band called 'Laza' (Ray Burnett/Ray Thomas) with Yours truly on drums.We would back you & (dare I say it) Rod Williams belting out those never ending Elvis songs, Remember now.Yes, I'm still playing rock etc with a band in Melbourne-& loving it. When your next in Australia please call or contact me somehow. I still have my demo you played on called 'Never had love before' you played some great lead on that. If you like, I would like you to play it when your on tour, I'll send you the music & tape. Good to se you are doing very well, great songs, great music, great Guy....All the best Keith.regardsPhil."
4,Interesting Debut Solo Album,"Keith Urban has come a long way since his days with the band The Ranch. His self-titled debut solo album is very good. I especially like the songs ""It's a Love Thing"" and ""For The Grace of God"". He does an excellent guitar instrumental recording entitled ""Rollercoaster"", also. However, if you're looking for traditional country music, you may want to try someone else. Most of his music fits into the ""crossover"" category. Overall, though, it is a very good solo album by Keith Urban."
5,I Love it,I just got this album and I really love it. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as Keith's later albums. I don't know what the reviewer on this site is talking about. If you like Keith Urban you will enjoy this album.
5,Worth every cent,"This cd is the best cd in my collection next to Rammstein's ""Herzelied"". Daniel Johns has really done it this time and is a DAMN good artist for a 20 year old. I bought this cd with only ""Anthem for the Y2K"" in mind. Now I listen to this everyday. ""I suggest you try it, it's breathtaking"" - Dr. Evilhttp://members.xoom.com/jhubin"
4,"Lighter than previous recordings, but still good.","I think Neon Ballroom is a good change for the band. After a grungy and live-ish Frogstomp, and darker and heavier Freak Show, i think its great that they are showing a softer side. But, just because there are harps and pianos, doenst mean its too foo-foo, and doesnt rock. It still really rocks, and is just about up there with their other recordings. Emotion Sickness is just hauntingly beautiful. I thik they have evoloved in the past years to be an even better band than they already were. Good job guys!"
1,I waited all this time for this!,"This album is absolutely pitiful. I am astonished by all the good reviews it has received. I have been a Silverchair fan for some time now, but when I put on their latest CD Neon Ballroom I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Are these songs that Barbra Streisand and Celine Dion rejected? It certainly seems that way. The song ""Miss You Love"" made me think that frontman Daniel Johns heard the Goo Goo Dolls song ""Iris"" on the radio and decided to duplicate it. Lots of adult contemporary schmaltz, and when they try to rock out (i.e. Spawn Again) the result is utterly laughable. The only marginally good songs (Dearest Helpless, Satin Sheets) sound like attempts to recreate the magic of previous work, only it doesn't pan out. I would say that you shouldn't believe the hype: There are plenty of talented rock bands that aren't getting the promotion. If you must, pick up one of Silverchair's other albums, or better yet, check out the band Feeder."
1,What's This??!,Silverchair...hmmm. How do I describe thee? Not very good. Correction: Not good at all. I bet ya girls love that guy though. He looks like one of them. Sounds like them.
5,Silverchair gives something for every mood,"I was a Silverchair fan a couple years ago, but my tastes changed enough so I wasn't listening to them anymore. Then some people at a message board were saying how great 'Neon Ballroom' is, so I got it-and they were right. Its a very versitile album-a little bit of everything. Its the perfect album for every mood I have."
2,The band is a one-hit wonder.,The only good song on the anthem of the year 2000. Which isn't even that good.
4,SILVERCHAIR IS PURE GOLD,"I have all three of the albums, and they all are pretty good. This new one is supposed to have a new sound, but it sounds just like the last one to me. I think that Daniel can really sing, he has a smooth mellow voice. You should by this album. ""Steam will rise"" and ""Miss you love"" are my top picks."
3,"Hallelujah, a step up from crap","Then again, so was Freak Show, a good CD with good songs but a copycat style. This is also a good CD, not great, but good. The biggest improvement is the attempt to get away from the guitar-filled angst-fest that sank their first two albums. Now it's orchestrated angst-fest. The lyrics still suck - Anthem For The Year 2000 and Spawn Again are the most annoying of the lot in this respect (the latter is still worth listening to) - but this CD shows that the band has a true knack for quality songwriting. My top picks are Miss You Love, Paint Pastel Princess and Dearest Helpless. 2 songs worth skipping - Anthem For The Year 2000 and the sluggish closer Steam Will Rise, which moves along at a nauseatingly slow pace. Maybe in a few years these boys will finally write their true masterpiece. If they keep improving like they have, it's inevitable."
5,SILVERCHAIR: KINGS OF MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"So good I can't even put it into words!!! The other albums were awesome, and this one is more than awesome!!!!!! You just have to hear it... It hits your heart and soul! So what are you waiting for??? Go buy it!!! NOW!!! I love silverchair!!!!!!!!"
5,I love this band!!!!!!!,"This is the greatest cd for anyone who likes a little rocking, yet still calm. I have got to say that it is my favorite right now. Plus, Daniel Johns has got the voice, and the lyrics. I love this cd cause it's lyrics actually have something to say like Spawn Again which talks about animal rights. I would definitely reccomend this cd cause it is not your everyday teeny-bopper standard music...it goes deeper than most music. I love musicians that really think, and have a message...that's why i enjoy Silverchair and their music."
2,"Great Waffle maker, But...","The Sensio 13124 Bella Cucina Belgian Waffle Maker is a great product for making perfect waffles at home, but its quality of craftsmanship has much to be desired. After having the unit and making perfect waffles for 6 months, the handle broke. Now the unit is useless. I called the manufacturer to order a replacement handle and they have been out of stock for 4 months. Every time I called, they said to call back the middle of the next month. If you want a waffle maker that you can use for more than a year...this isn't it."
1,Should Be Recalled!!!,"I cannot believe that this piece of junk has not been recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. As is noted by others, the hinge was made to break. Imagine having a hot waffle iron break apart in your hands. Rest assured that I will see to it that this product is removed from the shelves."
4,Big city ryhthms for me,love the album even though I not a mad michael feinstein fan.The band is great.
1,Smells great if you get the right one,"Unique,fresh and distinct although a bit on the sweeter side. True the smell is overpowering initially but give it some time to settle down.For me the ""Desire"" is an all time favorite but i was disappointed with what i bought from Amazon. The bottle which i got firstly doesnt say is Alfred Dunhill Desire it just says Dunhill Desire which is fine because the now its made by the P&G group and which is why probably they sort of renamed it or they came out with a new packaging but i noticed that the strength of the fragrance was weak infact very weak compared to the previous bottle that i had. I was a bit surprised and dissapointed and have no ideas why its the way it is.Ironically the picture shown here is of the old bottle.If you do get your hands on a bottle make sure it says Alfred Dunhill."
5,Desire by Alfred Dunhill,"This is the only cologne that I absolutely love on my husband! It really turns me on and I just can't get enough of him when he's wearing it!!! When he runs out and buys another in the meantime, it just isn't the same. A definite must have in my household! :)"
2,Not what I expected,"This book has been on my wish list for several years. The price had been over $200 but finally came down to a reasonable level.....glad I didn't purchase at the higher price, and not sure it is worth the $30 I paid.The book title should include ""Product and Sources"" as more than half the book (i.e. Part II: Products and Sources) is nothing more than manufacturer's source information for children's products. Great if you want children's sources all in one place, but this info can be found in many design directories, updated annually.Part I does provide standard dimensions and anthropometric information for those who design spaces for children, but half of that info is found in manufacturer's catalogs used when purchasing products. The book may be a quick, time-saver/concise reference since all the info is compiled into one book, but only a few chapters are useful. Disappointed in the book."
2,Basic,"Basic book about measures and a few more. Usefull for some technical information if you are designing furniture for the children and to know what sizes are suitable for every age. Also has a usefull list of resources.You will find it somewhat usefull, but don't expect too much of it."
2,disappointment,"this is one album by the cowboy junkies i won't be buying. such a let down. man, just get back to writing good music."
4,Decent Collection of Horrifying Noise,"There is something missing here. The musicianship is limited. Had Mark Smith not alienated his former bandmates, we might have been able to continue into something truly remarkable suggested by tracks like ""Hurricane Edward"" on the preceding ""Levitate"". The better tracks on here (""Touch Sensitive"", ""Antidotes"", ""The Crying Marshall"") proceed from the model suggested by ""Levitate""'s better tracks - heavily processed sound.What we did end up with here is an interesting collection of noise, like an industrial-tinged grunge music with the occasional layer of strings on top. It's pretty interesting in places and does show that the Fall is not dead, but they're by no account at the top of their artistic game."
2,"Okay for study aid, but don't depend on it for technical accuracy","There are technical mistakes that conflict with information in the Cisco Networking Academy Program Fundamentals of Wireless LANs Companion Guide. Book is helpful in reviewing, but not very well thought out. Mainly the book is comprised of a short chapter summery, reveiw questions, and vocabulary term fill-ins. If this book was edited better I'd like it. Not worth $22, but luckly I only paid $14."
1,Untrammeled Nonsense,"The author spends more time describing taut buttocks than describing his thinly-drawn, unsympathetic characters. This is less ""a Jesuit Tale"" than it is a self-absorbed psychology session. This took Shekleton FIVE YEARS to write? My God."
1,One word....garbage,This DVD and all DVDs of this series are garbage. You get an unknown musician explaining things like what keys Tony Banks played various songs and then he gives you examples on his crappy sounding keyboard. It's incredible how some people can come out with this garbage and get away with it.
1,this is why I don't read many modren works,Sentimental and uninteresting. Ethan Canin seems to think that the same kind of character is interesting over and over. And I hear this book was a best seller--no wonder nobody reads good books anymore when this is offered as great literary fiction.
5,"an entertaining, down to earth lesson by one of the best","Bronstein doesn't patronize readers. His own comments of his games are invaluable. The combinations, in the form of puzzles will improve your tactics almost immedaitely."
4,Kitchen sense cookbook,I bought this book after previewing it from a library. I knew what I was getting and I'm very pleased with my purchase. The book came used from a library so it was already covered to preserve the jacket.
4,Finally a soundtrack of a musical that plays like an album!!,"Having been introduced to the CD by an acquaintnace that saw the show in London I was instantly drawn into, and mesmerized, by the emotional connection I felt with the artists. Sit back and let the story unfold. You can actually feel the lyrics, not just listen to them. There is much to be said about the thespian nature of the performance that give the CD an almost disturbing connection to sinews of your heart, with just enough humor to keep you on the edge of your seat. Be careful the sofa may fold up as you rise!!."
3,effective,This product was effective but very overpriced. There is only enough in each bottle for one treatment and you need at least two treatments for it to be effective.
2,great graphix BUGGING GAME,"I really truley enjoyed this game's graphix, storyline and interaction, HOWEVER, this thing was so badly buggy I had to download three patches before I could even resume a sorta normal play. THen some of the patches screwed up the rest of the game!! I finally became so frusterated I had to uninstall it and put it back in the box. When I called the tech support for the game they said to uninstall the game and try again, starting over from scratch, I WAS almost DONE with the game!! No thanks I am a Computer Store owner and I will not be selling this game."
3,Falls Short,"This game, in the tradition of Myst and Riven, has appealing environments, reasonably challenging puzzles and a solid storyline, and is ultimately fun to play. Unlike Myst and Riven, Crystal Key offers a 3-D environment to navigate via Quicktime movies rather than clicking through two-dimensional snapshots. There are some disappointments, however. Graphics quality is uneven, and while I avoided serious difficulties the software does seem to contain some bugs. The soundtrack has some pleasing snippets of music, but clearly the producers didn't bother putting together much of a musical score. The interface, while easy to use, reveals some solutions through its highlighting of ""hot spots"" on the screen. The end of the game lacks the payoff sequence you'd hope to see after spending all those hours working through the puzzles and saving the world. Ultimately, one has some sense that this is basically an unfinished product, but at the price offered, its not a bad value."
2,5 years in the making for this?,"I was really excited about this game. I loved both Myst and Riven and was hoping that this would be as good or at least playable! I read all of the reviews and thought that the bugs and the lighting and the thing crashing every 2 seconds were not going to be that bad. Don't waste your money. This could be an enjoyable game, its not the most challenging but still enjoyable the only thing is you have to worry the whole time that something is going to go wrong, or tools that you know you need to do something just don't work no matter how many times you click on them.You need a cheat book just to tell you where certain things are because you can't see them! I am going to try to finish this game but I am very frustrated. Why would someone put out a game with this may problems?"
1,"Oh boy, this one is stinky!","I love puzzles. I loved Myst and Riven. I didn't expect Crystal Key to be as good. I did expect it to be relatively without bugs. The game play and bugs are so horrendous that the game is not playable, much less enjoyable. All I wanted was a nice adventure with some good puzzles - what I got was a migraine."
2,Less impressed,"White I agree with the first reviewers accessment, for the most part, I found some of the puzzles quite arbitrary. Who'd think of using a radio to (oops), well, do THAT. I never did find the lever near the spaceship because it was so dark; I had to cheat. The only hint that a certain tool has to be used again is that it stays with you; figuring out what it has to be used on and where is extremely obscure.When the graphics are good, they are almost great; but when they are bad, they are awful.Take into account that I play few games. I loved Myst and Riven and solved both. When I got stuck, I could always think of something logical, or at least not totally random, to try. I've played several others of the same sort. Crystal Key is the worst of the lot (thought at $20 also the cheapest).It would not run on a Mac PPC9500 on 8.1. It did run fine on a new (gold keyboard) PowerBook. It hung on an IBM ThinkPad 760e (Win95)."
2,Surprisingly dull,"I do like pastoral games, but this one was just a shade too soporific for me. I got about halfway through before I realized that I just didn't care if the aliens destroyed Earth or not. Bad sign!"
2,The Crystal Key,I found this game to be just so so. With computer graphics you'd think that they'd be able to make the aliens more alien. They remind me of stormtroopers in black armour. I feel this game was limited to 1930's stile imagination.
1,waste of time,"I was able to get this game at a discount, and still considered it to be a waste of time and money. The graphics are awful - the things you need to see in order to understand the game aren't visible. When you save a game and restore it later, you may find that an entire world experience has been lost. I am not a greatly experienced game player, but if this was the only game I had ever tried, I wouldn't try another."
2,not for a beginner,"I would not advise a beginner to raw foods to get this book -- some ingredients are just too hard to come by: Hawaiian Mellow White Miso? Azuki bean miso? kelp granules? dulce granules? Definitely for the more experienced raw foodist, who probably stacks all these ingredients in his pantry. Plus, it doesn't help that all the pictures are in black & white. If I wanted to attract someone to healthier eating with raw food then the more visual stimulation you can give them, the better. And I'm sorry, but these, at least in my opinion, are not 10 min recipes....maybe if you've been in the raw food world for a while but definitely not if you're just starting."
5,When Are They Going to Print More?,"O.K. The truth is I haven't read this yet. I usually buy used books. And I usually don't pay muchfor them. There are no new books and the used ones are $25 and up. I would pay $25 for a new book.I would read it very carefully, then pass it on to a friend. I was looking for a book like this asmy friend just lost her brother at a young age. I would love to give her this book, but these sellersdon't even claim the books are in great condition. How can I give a gift that looks old and used?!Isn't time to reprint this book?"
2,pre-broken strings,the strings came fast but the B and the E string came pre broken im not sure what happened maybe a factory error these are great strings just make sure you check them right away
5,Dragoon Guards/Parallel Tracks - CD,"Wonderful sound and so moving! If you love bagpipes, this CD is for you!Would recommend to anyone and especially my friends!"
4,Does the trick,"Just got this item so I haven't field tested it yet, but it seems to be sufficient for most people's needs. The mirror is very small and doesn't reflect a very clean image, so it's not really that great to look at yourself with."
1,This is the worst (....) purchase I have ever made!,"I paid and ordered this CD expecting it to be just the songs from the game. When I listened to it, I cannot explain how pissed off I was. The whole CD is just dialogue in Japanese that blocks out the actual songs. It's identical to old-time radio hours; watching T.V. with no picture kinda thing ya know? Those of you who like gitaroo man, do not purchase this CD. The music is blocked out by japanese people that just continuously talk.Once again, I must stress this: THIS IS THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1,"Outraged, Disgusted, Disappointed","The product does not deserve to be called a book.It is more like a pamphlet full of misprints.This transaction was a very bad reflection on Amazon.I have been a committed customer, but this is giving me second thoughts."
5,"this cd is the best cd ever made ,they are awsome.",This cd is the bomb. Blink 182 is the best group out!!!!!! I recommend this cd to all people.
1,"Do NOT order, does NOT fit a CRV","This is an Accord bracket. I made the big mistake of ordering. Obvious when it arrived that it was wrong part. When I called customer service, was transferred 10+ times to find they do not even carry one that will fit. Was told I have to pay shipping both ways and a 20% restocking fee.Do NOT order this part and I would recommend staying away from the company too."
1,Bad tooth design,"Cuts poorly, the teeth jam up with wood particles. I have been happy with other Fiskar products, but this one is a turkey. Don't waste your money."
5,wonderful,Kathy Dobie's book is truely great. She talked about the stereotypes put on women and reminds us that even today some things haven't changed regarding womens sexuality and how open they can be regarding their sexual practices but still reminds me a 23 years old women that stereotypes are still alive today. Many women can identify with her life and sexual experience whether good or bad. I couldnt put the down I finished it in one night. Truely amazing.
3,The writing felt forced; uncomfortable for a reader,"I feel terrible giving someone's life, their memoir, anything less than five stars. Who am I to judge? Surely, no one, but in the sense of reading and enjoying, I didn't much. An inspiring story, to an extent, I just didn't find Dobie's writing all that enticing.Also, sexually explicit, so do not read if not mature enough."
2,Not that great,"I just finished this book today. I am typically a fast reader, but not in this instance. It did not hold my attention enough to where I wanted to sit for periods of time to read it.The beginning of the book, really talked about nothing. The part having to do w/ the title was interesting, but after the act, it went back to being a bore. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It should read quickly for being so short- instead it drags."
5,Unlike many books I've come across,"I was very much impressed with this book. The first thing that struck me was the description of her early life and family. It depicts (beyond accurately) the smells, sounds, cameraderie, and love present in the house of a large family.When she got into the meat of her story, I was astounded at how honest she was willing to be with the rest of the world. She offered no apology for how she acted, only an acknowledgement that she acted that way. She did not profess undying hatred for the boys who raped her, but a description of why she loved being around them and why she was so heartbroken afterward.Somehow, Dobie managed to capture the world from the eyes of a 14/15 year old, but to tell her story through the woman who has come to terms with her past. Excellent, and highly recommended."
2,Too Shallow,"My daughter read this and found it wonderful, so I gave it a shot. It's a short book, one you can finish in 3-4 hours. That, I feel, represents part of the problem. This book lacks depth. The periods of her life are isolated from each other and she fails to make the connections between her family life, her wantoness, the group sex, and her afterlife.I'm not sure Dobie understnad the impact of her choosing to engage in sex with those boys in the care had on her adult life. Instead, the ending leaves one with a voyeuristic hangover similiar to watching The Jerry Springer Show."
2,Are we there yet?,"Although Dobie has a story to tell it should have been condensed into a much smaller form. Through out the slow first half of the book Kathy Dobie is no different, or even mildly entertaining, than any other girl growing up in the suburbs. Her life story finally does take a disturbing turn down the wrong path of adolecent discovery, but her writing of it leaves you feeling indifferent towards her. This is not a story of survival and triump, it is simple muddling through a depressing life."
1,The worst book on Toy Soildiers I have ever read,Values are incorrect. Prices quoted are self-serving. Intended to augment the author's sale list of toy soldiers.
4,Good Spreader for home use,"This spreader was very easy to assemble. It took me about an hour. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. One negitive was the way the spreader was packaged for shipping. It was in a thin cardboard box with no other protection. The box was broken with large holes in several locations. It had been repaired with tape. However, all the parts were inside and nothing was damaged.It is easy to set the application rate and the hopper holds enough fertilizer to do my entire yard with only a few fills. Operating the on / off lever would be easier if the handle was about a foot longer and closer to the front of the spreader.The plastic hopper is easy to clean.Overall a good spreader."
3,LILITH MYTH IS COMPLETELY FALSE,"Everything in mythology about Lilith is false.Lilith is the original Mother Goddess and full of light, as in Full Moon, not dark or black moon. She is the giver of nature / life and inspiration for artists. She has been painted black intentionally- so you will become dim to yourself.Lilith is the Lotus. That which grows beautifully from the still dank water of self hatred. Wake up. Now is the time."
2,The art has faded,"Gone is the magic that set Bryan Ferry apart from so many of his contemporaries. Way too twee at times. Lost is the artful stylings. The magic and influence that set Bryan Ferry's music years ahead of so many bands over the years! When I think of a Bryan Ferry cover I'm reminded of the brilliant rendition of the Harbach/Kern tune ""Smoke gets in your eyes."" That's the landmark by which I judge a Ferry cover. This twee selection of tunes found on his latest has been relegated to samey same...I mean, I might as well have bought a Celine Dione album or some such. Phenomenal disappointment...save your money or wait for it to show up in the used bins and cutout section of your fav cd shop!"
5,Wonderful album,"This is one of my favourite albums. I have always loved these songs and have them on other albums, sung by other artists, but having them all on one album and sung by the incomparable voice of Bryan Ferry, is wonderful. And that isn't to say that his versions are any better than the others, including the originals. In fact there are some songs on here, which are not a touch on the originals. For example, I still prefer Nina Simone's version of ""Love me or leave me"", and Chet Baker's version of ""Easy Living"". But it's not his intention to be better. He has succeeded in making a wonderful album of wonderful covers, given them a modern sound while still retaining their old style romance. The 20 page booklet is also cool. Includes all the lyrics and loads of old style drawings. This is truly a great album and highly recommended for music lovers."
5,A great buy.,"Very easy reading, nice book, definately has a lot of content, basically explains everything. Enjoyed reading it, this book is good for beginners just as well as starting Unix administrators. Author of this book explains a lot of stuff and gives some helpfull links from a to z."
3,Not Bad,The film was pretty decent. I must say that I was rather surprised. It was a little weak in spots but overall not bad
2,"average,but interesting","a decent acted film that was short on writing&fell off in spots,but was a interesting take on Hip-Hop meeting the Hamptons.i enjoyed the up-scale vibe of the film.this is a film worth checking out for what it trys to capture.a bit better but could have been even better.it does hold your interest."
3,History of the Eucharist,"Rubin consolidates an encyclopedic knowledge of the Eucharist and the rites of the feast of Corpus Christi into a balmy narrative, in this book, now in its sixth printing. The book, undoubtedly a standard in medieval and renaissance history and religion courses, can be viewed more as a textbook on the subject than an engaging read. In constructing her history, and it is extraordinarily intricate, fraught with untimely deaths, expulsions, and papal bulls never circulated, she draws from archival, apocryphal, and secondary sourse material. Considering the task she faced, she succeeds admirably. The reader wanting more will then face the task of combing through her extensive bibliograhy and copious footnotes."
5,Great book!,"I don't know how accurate these recipes are as far as Elvis goes, but they are truly southern. I recommend this book to any Elvis fan. I will be trying some at Christmas."
4,Wonderful Help in this often delicate situation,"As a birthmother and wife of an adoptee, I see the adoption issue from two different standpoints and this book is one of the few that grants all three positions in the adoption triangle equal importance while still maintaing that the adoptees interest must superseed the desires of anyone else.The different areas of opening a closed adoption, ranging from how to tell the adoptee, to what to say on that first meeting, to, what do we tell other people work not only for an adoptee who is a minor, I think the advice and suggestions, would work equally well for an adult adoptee who is either searching or has been found. I highly recommend this book to anyone involved in the adoption triangle."
5,Great!,"On the strength of this one album(more! more!), Lunasa may be my second favorite(behind Dervish)Celtic band currently active. Hooray! A new band that features uillean pipes. Awesome flute and whistle playing, too."
5,SMOKING HOT!,This brilliantly fresh and energetic group is a fantastic addition to any music collection. Very highly recommended. You'd have to be half dead to not be tapping a foot to it.
4,Interesting character studies,"It's a bit slow for the American reader, but Mr Selvon produces vivid pictures of his characters. It's certainly worth reading, whether you're a Trini native or if you simply love the islands."
4,"""Fukoku Kyohei!""","Want to find out about the military-industrial complex in Japan and find out about the ideological underpinnings below it? This is the place to start. Then start researchng the Meiji Restoration, where it all began. I didn't give this book 5 stars, mainly because it seemed rather weak on the Meiji underpinnings of Japanese techno-nationalism to me. Then again, I'm working on a thesis on the ideology of the Meiji Restoration, (and am hence deperately seeking any available source on the topic) so maybe I'm a little less than objective on the matter. If your interests are more modern (particularly postwar) then this is the book for you!"
3,Disappointing audio,"I hate to knock something that involves the almost mythical talents of Artur Rubenstein, and Jascha Heifetz, but the audio quality is so primitive (I wouldn't have said that 30 years ago,) that it is at times painful to listen to."
4,Rambling Charm,"I wasn't crazy about this record the first time through -- it felt unfocussed and rambling. But then it crept up on me the same way The Libertines did. In fact, rambling is part of its charm. These 9 cuts are the sound of English boys figuring out their place in the world -- if they sound confused, it's because they are. But guitars and drums and bass help them find their way, especially on the confessional ""Things I've Done Before"", and the lover's kiss off ""Lights Out""."
5,You don't have to be a country fan,"No, you don't. After his Jamie period, Duane joined RCA and it resulted in a bunch of superb albums. These two belong definitively to this category. I love them both, but my absolute favorite is the early 60-ties Nashville sound of ""Twangin'Country Song"". All my favourite Nashville musicians are there to help Duane to make this album a gem. And they succeed, no question about that. All the tunes are great but some are played so beautifully they seem out of this world. No need to say more - you like Duane Eddy, you'll love this CD."
5,Very relevant for today's white racialist,"The book is excellent in explaining the ancient religion of our ancestors and the symbols and rituals associated with such. their are those who would like to see books like this suppressed or censored, but fortunately we still have freedom of speech. I highly recommend it and it is a book you will go back to again and again."
5,Return to form,"A long time Hootie fan was delighted by the album especially when it seemed they had lost the plot during the last couple of years. Came from the UK to the USA to see them do it live and it all fits together beautifully. Musically they are are all getting better-and hopefully will be around for a while. Compared to what else is on offer-it's worth an award or two and the band being taken seriously. A very good album indeed that makes you cry, smile and dance"
1,At least it didn't cost much!,"I like adventure games, but I like them to follow some sort of logical puzzle solving, so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators, figure out how they think and figure the game out that way. These puzzles are completely illogical, obviously designed to be frustrating, and keep you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game. Also, although the 2D backgrounds were interesting at times, calling this a 3d game is quite a stretch by any definition. Even the 3d cut-scenes were crappy, and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible. Supposedly the game made ""game of the year"" in Europe, they must be pretty hard up over there, now I know not to take that as a commendation."
3,"Nothing like the orignal version, but close...","..the title says it all. actually, the very first version with Noah as Esmeralda was the best they ever made. It's really too bad she didnt want to be part of all the business that was made around this show, because she really has a great voice. but i guess she had her reasons..."
2,A weak super-hero film,"The fantastic four was a very popular comicwhen it came out, but this film just did notlive up to the comics. It was terrible, infactI was expecting it to be one of the best super-herofilm ever. turned out, I was wrong.weak script, to fast paced,but the special effects were good.Rated PG-13 for language violence and some suggustive content"
4,Very good movie,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I got it used through [...]. Some comic turned movies, or cartoon turned movies are not that great. This is well worth the money. Plus, it has Jessica Alba in it!"
2,Terribly disappointing...,"I can't say I wasn't warned. I had been dying to see Fantastic Four for quite some time. Despite warnings from my boyfriend and my brother that this movie was a huge letdown, I had to watch it and decide for myself. On the one hand, if I'd listened to them, I'd have watched one less bad movie. But on the other hand, if not, my best friend and I wouldn't have laughed at it's complete stupidity (hence why I give it 2 stars for at least it gave us something to make fun of). It truly was one of the biggest disappointments for me in a while. Sad, because it really looked so good in the previews. If you want to see it, I'd advise renting first and then if you like it (for what reason I can't imagine) go buy it. A big BOO from me!"
2,Fantastic Four...,"Gang, I read the Fantastic Four comic books as a pre-teen. It's a joke to me that FF got this treatment. Reed Richards, down on his luck? Reed Richards/Sue Richards, not together? Victor von Doom, financing their work? Even worse, Kirby is buying in to this scheme? Give me a break. I won't waste my money! Two stars..."
3,"Enjoyable, not DNA-changing","I enjoyed this movie pretty well. I have to say it can't quite compare with the new par for the course in comicbook movies since Iron Man, but it was worth the rental. How it compares to the comics/series, I'm not sure, but I got a hankering for comicbook movies recently. If you're the type to geek about me saying comicbook instead of ""graphic novel"", which I often do say, then you probably won't like this movie a lot, as if you didn't already know. If you're looking for a fun superhero movie that isn't super serious, then you may well be entertained. I'm not sure this'll blow anyone's socks off, but I liked it, especially for the price of renting it for a night."
3,A good example of poor editing,"The Fantastic Four Extended Cut is a good example of how not to edit a movie. Many of the scenes put back in are either completely unnecessary, repetitive, or just plain silly (such as the Wolverine impersonation scene which is all three). As a result, the middle section of the movie now seriously drags. I think I prefer the original edit to this version, though there were several positive additions (sadly ruined but those that were not).My recommendation would be that if you already have the original don't bother with this one. If you don't have the original, get this version because the original edit is on it too so you can have both versions, and if you enjoy special features there's a second disc full of them."
5,it's great just not an action movie!!,"if you expect action umm...go watch batman begins or spider-man 1 or 2 or the incredibles ok? because this is just a setting up story movie ok? there's only...1,2 and 3 action scenes i think can't remember."
4,Much Better than X-men movie,"I agree with Bob. The producers did a much better job with the Fatastic Four than they did with the x-men. The special effects are much better and the characters actually resemble the real comics. And the characters actually use their powers, for example the mutants that fly actually do it. It's not like the x-men where the only mutants that seem to get any action are wolverine and mystique. The invisible woman's powers is similar to what I expected to see from jean grey and magneto. The human torch really flies and doctor doom actually fires bolts of electricity from his hands whereas storm from the x-men never did. Don't get me wrong I think the x-men will stump the fantacstic four in battle but the producers just did a better job with this one."
2,The worst of the worst,"This movie is right up there with Daredevil as one of the worst comic book adaptations ever. And to think this is a remake of a Fantastic 4 movie made back of the 90's. If you are going to redo something shouldn't you make it better rather than aiming to the lowest common denominator?It's got a Dumbed down plot, very uninteresting chanters and Alba who cant act here way out of a paper bag. The only entertaining character is The Human Torch but that still isn't enough to recommend this movie. Add to that the Rock Music score that they blast frequently during the movie and you have a good movie for teens and that's about it.Maybe if they do a sequel they will get it right or better yet go see a good comic book movie like Spiderman 2, X-men 2 or even Darkman."
1,Garbage,"This movie is pure and utter garbage, it will have a nice night at the razzies in march competing with stealth for worst idea ever"
5,GREAT FOR LONG TIME FANTASTIC FOUR FANS,THE movie was great good actors good writeing. this movie is goodfor the people who are long time fans of the Fantastic Fourthis is one of the best movies of the year this move for the super hero fans
3,Four earns a Three,"The bar for comic book movies has been set pretty high with the success and quality of films such as the Batman and Spiderman series; not to mention Superman. The greaat thing about this movie is that the Fantastic Four gets the star treatment here rather than some B movie that does not do the comic series justice. Admittedly, I was only a casual F4 fna as a kid. This movie was very entertaining and is never dull. The actors are compelling and the story is decent. There are some fun scenes with nifty special effects. A couple of cool scenes include a time where the team comes together in a fight with Doctor Doom and they all use their powers collectively, and a scene where the Thing and Doctor Doom fight at the bottom of a pool. Enjoy this movie for what it is... a solid three star fun flick that looks fantastic on this DVD."
2,If you want more special features and the extended edition you have to buy it on DVD,"Part of the reason I buy movies on disc is for the special features like ""making of"" documentaries, outtakes, etc. Unfortunately I haven't found a Blu-ray copy of the first Fantastic 4 movie that includes all the special features you get with theFantastic Four (Two-Disc Special Edition)on DVD. There are commentary tracks on this Blu-ray, but that's about it.I think it's a shame that you have to buy Fantastic 4 twice if you want the movie in high def AND all the special features. Worse, it's not as simple as putting disc 2 from the DVD in your Blu-ray case, because disc 1 from the DVD (above) also has seamlessly integrated extended scenes--you just can't get those on Blu-ray at all.I like the movie, but I give this Blu-ray two stars because it lacks most of the features found on the DVD version."
4,Fantastic Four was no Spider-Man but is was not a bad movie at all.,I saw Fantastic Four this weekend and I thought it was much better than what some reviewers and critics made it out to be. If your looking for a movie as as good as Spider-Man or even Batman Begins then you will probably not like this movie. Now if your looking for a movie with action and a sense of humor (think Blade Trinity/Ryan Reynolds) then you will probably enjoy the Fantastic Four. Chris Evans who plays Johnny Storm brings some great laughs to this movie. The movie was entertaining and did far better than what anyone expected it to do by being the #1 movie in America opening with 56 million dollars and finally ending a 19 week slump in Hollywood. Fantastic Four is not a great movie but for any marvel comic book fan this is one worth watching.
3,"Ho hum, hi-tech version of classic comic book","The long awaited and much bally-hoo'ed movie version of Marvel Comics' THE FANTASTIC FOUR is an unfortunate disappointment. Long winded and bogged down in ""Origin,"" the film lacks any kind of POV from the writer or director, so it's consequently as one-dimensional as the very comic book on whichi it's based. That would be fine if it were a cartoon or half-hour action series, but one liners, cute gimmicks and bathroom humor does not a movie make.The skills of an extremely talented cast are woefully wasted, but there's plenty of high tech visuals, special effects and noise for kids in search of a matinee-style adventure flicks. But, no sequel, please!"
5,good if you haven't read any comic books!!,i love this movie it's way better than incredibles it's not serious which is good if you want to avoid serious stuff i don't like serious movies anymore it's boring when they're serious ok? i think it's for people who are sick of serious stuff like i'm sick of serious cause incredibles ruined everything for me i wasn't even sure if i wanted to see this after incredibles but that movie ruined everything for super hero movies - every sinlge thing!!! i started to hate super heroes after that ok?
3,You saw all the best parts in the preview.,"It is an ok movie for what it is a fun superhero movie in terms of special effects and explosions but not much else. The dialog is awful you're hot, well thank you so are one. See how profound it is? And that's just one of many examples of dialog that makes me shudder. Also I feel there was en effort on the part of the people affiliated with this movie to make it TOO funny, TOO comical. It really took a lot away from the movie.Now that being said the character development is wonderful you get to see these people move from ordinary people into excepting their role as superheros. Everyone did a great job with this they actually struggle with it unlike most superhero movies. Its really the part that saved the movie for me.Overall-Didn't like it but I didn't despise it either. Will I see it agian probably not but I was entertianed for the most part. If I was given the choice I would probably go see Batman Begins again."
2,bottom of the super hero chain,"I just saw this movie and was let down. Not much of plot. I thought the actor who played doom could have been better, wheres the accent? The human torch was the best part of this movie though it was abvious he and much of this movie was aimed at teens. Batman Begins was a much much better film. There was some Unnecessary gross violence and sexual Innuendo. Filmakers should make films that are watchable classics in ten years, not trendy teen movies with trendy fads like extreme sports."
4,This is the Promotional Cruiser....,"I thought this was the cutest thing for girlz....Wayyyyyyyyyyy better than the slow remote control Barbie. I got the black one (Dad's love blk mom's love the champagne) for my daughter as part of the Christmas promotion. This is the only powered car they have for Bratz (Rockn' Bratz Cruiser is NOT powered.) (called store, & for on-line complaints dial 800-toysrus) I plan on buying the champagne colored on for her also. I strongly reccomend this toy. Just like all dolls and babies and their accessories you should handle with care. It may be little fragile, after all it is for girlz, but I think it teaches them how to care for things. If you like to bang or run into things with remotes controlled cars, this is not the one. Strictly for profiling ur Bratz. Hence the word CRUISER. A true diva would have nothing less. So have fun and be careful. Also correction the promotion is on until 12/10/2005. Happy Shopping!"
3,"Good info, bad production","I suppose the information in this book is solid and useful, but the production values are so amateurish that it's very hard to get through. It seems as if Mr. Richardson typed this thing up on his computer, hit ""Print"", and sent it right to his publisher... no copy editing, no nothing. Basically, it's a good few web pages worth of info, with amateur web page grammar, language, etc. For the price, it's probably worth it, but don't expect that that money has purchased any great level of quality."
3,To Consider,"This is a beautiful game and well worth finishing. The graphics linking the three environments are repetitive, however. There is also a patch to download. I found two items to be significant problems. First, some of the puzzles are HARD as they seem arbitrary, and not based on what you learn as you go. I had to use a walkthrough. Second, the game features a language which was actually invented decades ago and plays no real role in completing the game, but seems to be important as you play it."
3,"disapointing, but ok","I'm not quite sure what the makers of 'So Close' are trying to achieve with this movie... there aren't enough laughs or sexy action to make this the 'charlie's angels' clone the packaging will tell you it is.It seems to want to be serious drama at the same time, with the strangely overdeveloped background of the relationship of Shu Qi's character and her boyfriend a prime example.Speaking of Shu Qi, she's the prime reason I hired the DVD, but she kinda disapears after the first half of the movie, with all the emphasis going on to her far less appealing companions.Still has some fun scene though, and the big finale is worth watching... it's just a pity they couldn't make up their mind as to what sort of movie they were making."
4,Entertaining enough,"As in many Hong Kong movies story is just ok but none the less this is a very stylish movie to watch. The girls are gourgeous, dressed to kill and perform their fights as if it was ballet. However, if you are expecting anything more than that you'll be dissapointed."
4,At first was mad...then it builded up Well!!!,"At first I thought that this movie was gong to be so damn cheesy...but the end was very good!!! The struggle of a younger sibling trying to be like her older sister was touching and at the same time frustrating as hell, i was so mad at the younger sister!!! But the plots tie in well to give a surprisingly good ending."
4,To Spark Anew Love's Latent Fires,"Their souls stayed twinned through the testing of love. A fire that kept its smolder. A beautiful, feel good movie."
4,Excellent Album,"I found this album in the [money amount]bin at a local CD store. I had heard one of their cuts on a Putomayo label compilation, so I bought it. I was amazed. The opening track is by far the best. Its full of energy, rythem, and a great melody. If I knew how to dance, this song would have me doing that. The other vocal songs on the album are also very good, with very beautiful lyrics (written in the dialect in the CD booklet). The instrumental tracks aren't quite as great but they are still good. At one point they even sound a bit like Blues Traveler with a harmonica solo. All in all, a very good album. It could have been a little better. But definitly worth the full price."
1,HUGE disappointment,"We should be celebrating the ultimate release of some of our eras best loved films: the superior extended release film versions with all the additional documentary content included with the deluxe dvd versions in the amazing aural and visual clarity of Blue-ray high definition. Instead we get the inferior theatrical release with none of the added content. What can be gained from this, other than additional revenue at the expense of a supporting fanbase? Do not buy these watered down Blue-ray versions, instead hold out for the extended version release which is eventually to come."
1,Give me a break!,I agree with everyone else! How can New Line not have both Theatrical and Extended Cuts in one set! What a load of bullspit! Forget the blu ray version anyway...I'll just stick to DVD extended version set I currently own unless they actually get their heads out of their &%@*$)%! and make a set the fans actually want to buy.
1,Thanks,"Thanks to the first reviewers that helped to keep my money in my pocket.These movies have a lot of fans out there, and I'm afraid a lot of us can be quite impulsive. I am one of those at times. I was ready to hit that pre-purchase button until I saw the start rating and went wt?.Well, the studio's have gotten me on numerous occasions with DVD sets. Sorry, it's not happening with Blu. For those of you that want only the theatrical version, um, ok. For those that can afford to purchase the same movies twice, that's great and I'm glad for you. Sorry, but I don't make that kind of money.New Line - shame on you.Almost, shame on me.And again, thanks for saving me from the double dipping."
1,Terrible,"I won't be spending my money on this sort of drivel ever again: Why the hell would I want to watch a 3 hour ""masterpiece"" about 2 midgets going ""Mr Frodo, sir"" and the other going ""... Sam""Ditch this rubbish."
1,Pure Greed!,"It is unbelievable the lengths to which the big studios will go to squeeze yet some more money out of our pockets. They had already made 1000% with the theatrical release: 300 million production budget, 3 billion in tickets! (Source=Box Office Mojo) And if that wasn't enough they created two versions on DVD. Now they want to do the same thing all over again with BR. Didn't Blu-Ray win the format war becuase of higher capacity than HD-DVD? Just goes to show you that none of that really matters because all these people want is to rip you off. Blu-Ray has more than enough space to put not only both theatrical and extended version, but they can also accomodate both BR/DVD/Digital versions. This is total BS. Send these greedy aholes a nice big F-YOU by not buying this pathetic release."
1,Almost Thrilled To See This.,"We know that LOTR is going to look phenomenal on Blu-Ray, so seeing this set pop up thrilled me...until I saw that they were only giving us the theatrical release, thus presumably making us wait an immeasurable period before announcing the extended editions. Not cool, not at all. Milking it is absolutely ridiculous, so give a nod to the fans--the extended edition should be available simultaneously."
1,Special Edition Only Real Version,"Same as others. I won't spend a penny for the versions shown in the theature. The extended special edition fills in so many gaps and improves the experience so much, why should I waste my money? I have been waiting to see this masterpiece on Blu-Ray, but I guess I will wait a little longer."
5,What's wrong with you people?,"Reading the reviews here, I find the sense of entitlement astonishing. And disspiriting. Have we come to this? Like, companies are evil and greedy and beneath contempt if they don't cater to you personally and your wishes. At all times. Instantly. You people know they'll come out with a full featured edition, with every last scrap of film ever shot (and story boards and endless commentary) included. Wait for that edition. I don't know. It might be six months. Interminable I know. But for many of us, probably the vast majority of us, a theatrical edition, with seven disks of hobbits and wizards and orcs is fine. Instead of slamming Peter Jackson and the production company -- who produced this gem against all odds -- maybe have some humility, think of someone other than yourself, and be patient. They'll get to you and your needs soon enough."
1,Wait Wait Wait!,"I was super excited when i heard news that LOTR is coming out in Blu-Ray.. but since only the theatrical edition is coming out, I'm gg to console myself by watching my extended edition DVDs again. Not going to spend $$$ on the theatrical edition..Come on, I already own the extended editions on DVD. To buy the same edition again on Blu-Ray is already a great financial sacrifice.... Can't New Line be nice, for once? Just release both editions at the same time and let consumers decide!"
1,Ridiculous - Extended Versions Please!,I will pass on this as will everyone else with common sense. Extended versions please.
1,Both versions please,THIS IS ONLY THE CRAPPY THEATRICAL VERSION NOT THE EXTENDED!!!! C'MON PETE GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!
1,No HD Extras,"[...]Note that the three features are blu-ray, but none of the other discs are. They are DVDs. And there are no new special features included.WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED EDITIONS."
1,Extended version: Yes; Theatrical version: Never More,"Common, after watching the extended version, it's impossible to watch the original theatrical version again.I have no option except to wait until New Line launch the extended version in BD.They should be out of mind. It's unbelievable to have such launch. The theatrical version is good, but, compared to the extended one, it's terrible. It's like watching only part of a movie, missing around 25% of it!"
4,Love the Series,I love the series and it makes for a great gift! The only thing I was disappointed about was that it does not come with a sleeve that holds all three movies together.
1,What an incredible greedy ploy,"I agree with others. I've been waiting a long time for LOTH on Blu-ray, but will boycot this release. Let's hope the copies rot on the shelf and they loose money on it. This is an obvious ploy to milk more money from the die hard fans (buying this copy AND the extended cut in another year).We've waited this long, what's a little longer. Don't give into the corporate greed. There are plenty of other things to spend you're money on and with companies that actually appreciate fans of thier movies.Hoping they come to their senses and release both at the same time (or better yet, both in the same release)..."
1,Con Artists,The movie is obv awesome. What is not awesome is how they are trying to trick people into buying both versions. We want the extended version now!
1,THANK YOU WB... For delaying this mess!,"WB has apparently decided to delay this, no doubt to release the theatrical cuts and extended cuts in one release via seamless branching. That's the right thing to do. Anything else is unfair to us as consumers. I'm glad they seem to be on their way to making the right kind of release these films deserve. It will be worth the wait!"
1,Wait for the Extended Version,Yep...like everyone has said...don't waste your money on this version...wait for the extended ones. Hopefully NOBODY buys these.
1,Extended Edition !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT/DVD. This product is being created FOR NO OTHER REASON than to dupe people into buying this movie twice...again. Those of us who were huge fans bought the original DVDs of the theatrical releases. THEN the studio FINALLY released the extended editions, even though they could have released both at the same time. Now that BluRay has won the High Def battle, the studios are salivating at screwing us all again the same way!"
1,Rip off,"I agree with what everyone is saying about being shortchanged. But after all these years since DVD's came on the market who didn't know that they would do just what they did. I think what they do sucks but they control the movies. Knowing that they are going to do just what they did, we should not buy any of those new boxed sets unless it includes the director's cut and all the extras. If they don't sell the theoretical sets early the director's cut will come out sooner.I figure that the better box set will be out just in time for Christmas."
1,Not THIS Time!!!!,"I have bought the original DVD, The extended DVD. Why do I need to buy this? Why? WHY? WHY?"
1,Holding out for the extended versions,Wow - it's a little insulting to release these a year before the extended versions. Not buying them twice like i did the DVD. Don't be so greedy New Line!
1,Do Not Buy This Edition of LOTR. Wait for Extended Version,Do Not Buy This Edition of LOTR. Wait for Extended Version. These movie studios need to learn to release content that customers want.
1,"Fool me once,..................",I just have to laugh! I finally got a HD TV and a Blu-ray player and one of the first movies I wanted to watch was LOTR in all it's Blu-ray glory.............and it isn't even out yet LOLOLOLOL!(at the time of this review anyway) Not to mention the extended edition is in limbo until 2011 or 2012!?Seven (7) years and hundreds of crappy Blu-ray movies later....and not even the full editions. Unbelievable.
1,Is this any surprise from a company that stole from it's director?,Don't buy this copy whenever it comes out. Newline are a bunch of crooks evidenced by the lawsuit Peter Jackson had to file in order to get paid tens of millions Newline owed him. Wait until Peter releases his extended versions. Go to hell Newline.
1,Should get zero stars for preying on good folk,"I'm jumping on the bandwagon and dropping a 1-star rating for New Line/Warner for so blatantly double, triple, and quadruple dipping on hard working folks in the middle of the worst economic times since the Great Depression. Shame on you greedy b@st@rds! That said, bring on the extended cuts!"
1,Yet another version of LOTR,How many version can they bring out; this must be the most exploited series of movies ever and they aren't even putting the extended version on the disc; dirty rotten greed. New line is in control by Sauron.
1,It is all about the money,Why the extended version of this amazing film is not on blu ray is a disgrace.Just keep bleeding money from us one version at a time.I haven't watched this and I won't- once you have seen the extended version there is no way you can watch the theatrical version
1,Do Not BUY!!!,this product is a ripoff these are just the original versions and not the much better extended edition. it seems like the studio is trying to dupe people into buying the movie twice again.
1,RIP-OFF!!,"Blatant slap in the face to all LOTR fans, yet again!! I bought the theatrical DVDs... then the Extended DVDs... now they want us to get this only to waste money again when the extended Blu-rays come out. Have some respect for your fans and release the extended blu-ray discs. We want to support and celebrate ART not capitalist-monopolistic corporations. do the right thing and don't buy this, WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED!!!!"
1,Extended versions are all I want. Holding out.,"This is a great trilogy and anyone who enjoyed it probably already owns the DVD set, maybe even two sets since the extended versions came out after the theatrical release. Why wouldn't they release the ""Director's Cut"" extended versions on the same discs as the theatrical for the Blu set? This just stinks of milking a cash cow. Like so many other reviews here, I vote one star for the product release itself being incomplete."
1,so it looks like it's gonna' be 2011 or 2012 for me.,"I hate waiting until 2012 for the extended blu ray editions, but I'll just have to do w/ my up-sampled extended DVD versions until then!"
1,Shameful Schemers,Another shameful scam perpetrated by $Saul Zaentz$ and $Toby Emmerich$. Let's see what clever $scheme$ their Hollywood busy fingers devise with future releases of The Hobbit. I'm sure JRR Tolkein has been rolling in his grave.
1,Why???,"Why in the world would anyone buy this when the ""real"" ones are coming out later? Those who are giving it 5 stars are either (1) rating the movie, which deserves 20 stars..., or (2) saying they like the theatrical version better; which is understandable, but would come with the Extended Edition everyone is petitioning for anyway.This is purely a way for New Line to bleed LOFTR fans dry, banking on the fact some might buy the same movies twice after already buying the same movies twice before!I view this as something to rent to get me excited about the Extendeds I will defintitly buy later."
1,They think we are suckers,I don't think one version is better than the other but we should have the imediate option of choosing which one we want. If I decide to get this set it will be on Ebay so they dont get my money.
1,DON'T GET THIS VERSION! WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED EDITION!!!!,"Peter Jackson said, that the extended edition will be available at the same time when the Hobbit film is release."
1,Rip-off,"Why are they bothering to release this version when everyone wants the extended edition? Because they figure we are dumb enough to buy this one now, then pay all over again when they provide the ""real"" version. Well, add me to the list of people who are not that dumb."
1,con artist,"I think everyone has said it already, I can't believe they wouldn't offer the extended versions right away, there is no way I will purchase this! New Line should respect the loyal fans who have been waiting for the blu ray for so long."
1,SHAME. Your greed is shameful.,There is absolutely no excuse for releasing a theatrical version first and then milking us AGAIN for the extended. I bought them all TWICE ALREADY on DVD. I feel stupid enough for that - no way I do it again.It's sad they are willing to do this to loyal fans. Just sad. Call me when the extended versions are out.
4,The content speaks by itself,"The movie speaks by itself. The extended edition presents many new scenes that will delight you.One drawback is that for Spanish speakers, the first movie (The fellowship of the ring) has NOT subtitled in Spanish.The additional material as always is very good."
1,Blu-Ray should have both versions!,"It's really sad. Newline had an opportunity to create a master version that had both the theatrical release AND the extended version. This just screams ""trying to milk people for more money"".I won't do it. I urge everyone to avoid buying LOTR blue ray till Newline wakes up and realized people want and demand more for there money. Blu-rays have more space, having both on the same discs should not be an issue.I await them getting there act together before they'll get a dime for me."
1,Not gonna do it!,"Earth to New Line... Come in New Line...There will be no ""double-dip"" on the Blu-Ray version of LOTR.There is no excuse for not releasing the Extended Editions to coincide with this Theatrical release or (even better) include BOTH versions in a single set.Like the majority of posters, I will wait for the extended edition. If that wait is until 2011, so be it. New Line is hurting its bottom line by delaying the extended version. By summer 2011, it is likely that the HD streaming market will devour some of the potential buyers for this title on Blu-Ray."
1,Let's hope it's not just greed,"Unless Jackson et al. embellish and significantly improve upon their ""extended"" DVDs (by fixing a few technical glitches, smoothing out just a few ""busy"" scenes with too much ""camera"" and perhaps deleting that awful, unfortunate, in-your-face ""THE EYE!!!"" line by Cate Blanchett), the selling of the lesser (theatrical) version in this timed fashion will come across as milking it for every consumer dollar. But maybe Jackson will revisit the ""extended"" versions and create a new work better than th 1st ""extendeds"". Let's hopE"
1,WHAT?!?,"Abolute Machiavellian double dippling. They have already done this THREE times on the DVD release, so I don't see why New Line should be any different. Just because Miramax folded, New Line has usually been pretty good with their stuff. Although the Grindhouse double release also just shows what money grubbers the Weinstein brothers are, and will milk every last cent they can out of a devoted fan base, instead of giving a great product to begin with. DO NOT BUY this product and wait for other release at the unspecified ""later date."" Let's all put an end to this despicable practice by saying enough! You already got our bucks for the DVDs, can't you ease up a little on the Blu Rays? I guess everybody wants to be like George Lucas and go back to the well and fleece their fans some more."
1,"Movie is awesome, but the theatrical release on blu-ray is selfish, pointless, and downright greedy.",It's because of New Line's greed that we don't have Peter Jackson directing The Hobbit (remember the lawsuits filed by him and the actors against New Line for not giving them a cut in the DVD sales?). Not releasing the extended editions on blu-ray at the same time as the Theatrical is a slap in the face to hardcore fans of the films.
1,Don't fall for it.,"This release is a complete rip-off. Warner Bros. needs to stop fooling buyers and realize no one wants the Theatrical Cuts any more. Everyonerealizes the Extended Editions are the superior cut of the films. At least if nothing else, package both cuts into this Blu-Ray set. This is undercutting the buyers."
1,To hell with hollyweird!!!!!!!!!!,"I agree with every 1 star review because we've already been fooled enough by our con man president and the one before him and now hollyweird is trying to rip us all off again. Thanks, but no thanks."
2,"Lord of the Rings Trilogy, blu-ray",The third video is missing about 20 mins of the original video.I think it's terrible that they don't let you know that.I wouldn't waste your money on the set.
1,"SHAMELESS......LUCAS, TAKE NOTICE!!!","This is freakin' ridiculous. They have to be aware that many of us have already purchased all of these movies twice already. Haven't they raised enough money off of us. Bought all three as they were released originally, and then bought the extended-version box set. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!! Force New Line to release the extended versions ASAP. What they are trying to do is just sad and a slap in the face to those who follow the series. I pray George Lucas does not do the same with Star Wars. I have been waiting on that release for years now. Haven't bought it yet. HELLO... GEORGE!!!! RELEASE THE DARN MOVIES ON BLU-RAY ALREADY, AND DO NOT TRY TO BURN US LIKE NEW LINE DID!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Waiting for extended edition,"Dont want to buy this, and then shell out more $$$ when the extended edition comes out, come on......"
1,Buyer Beware!,"Just like most of the reviews on this set say, DO NOT BUY unless you specifically want the Theatrical version of the movie and not the extended cut which most of the fans really want. This set is just a ploy to get some extra cash before the true release comes out."
1,And Just Like That... Someone's Bank Account Gets Bigger!!!,What a bunch of D Bags! They could've done so much with this release... talk about a big ball being dropped- Do what everyone else is doing-WAIT for the real full length editions-it's the way Jackson intended them to be seen.D Bags!
2,All this wait and not even extended?,"We've waited forever for this and it's only the theatrical cuts? let me guess... they are going to wait until everyone has this since they are psyched for HD LoTR, and then release extended later for a money grab just like the standard dvd releases.The different cuts both should have been included as an option so I guess I'll be waiting even longer to own the trilogy in HD."
1,Where's the LOTR Blue Ray Extended Edition?!,I will NOT be buying the Blue Ray version of LOTR until you guys release the extended edition - with all the special features from the previous DVD editions. Send this one back to the vault!
1,More money,"Yes, I purchased the theatrical version--then I was happy to see an extended version! Yippee--so I shelled out another bundle. I will just wait now for the extended blu-ray--when it's on special discount since I've already spent more money on the movie than I ever intended."
1,Waiting for the extended edition?,"There is no reason at all - beyond the obvious one, dollars - why they could't put *both* cuts in the one boxed set.It's clear from the large number of comments that I am not alone in deciding not to purchase one version of the films when my preferred version will be released at some point in the future.Of course, there's a danger in making fans wait - that something will happen in the meantime that will damage sales further (such as an explosion of streamed high definition content). Still, I'm sure that the corporate bean-counters know best."
5,Best movie ever!,"The Lord of the Rings movies have the perfect combination of emotional acting, fantastical scenery, and thrilling plot twists. Peter Jackson and his team did a superb job and deserved every single Oscar they got. The movies are a wonderful tribute to the books. Fortunately, they've been made so well that they can be enjoyed by all, from the Tolkien aficionado to kids who haven't yet read the books. If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen the greatest adventure in cinematography during the past decade."
1,You have enough money...,"Given how many times I've seen the extended versions on DVD *AND* the insult this is, I might just NetFlix the extended cut once and to hell with it.Way to go, Marketing Department. Not everyone is fool."
1,No thanks,A blatant cash grab. I will not be buying this on Blu-ray until the extended edition is released ... and I am obviously not alone.
1,"Give us the extended version, please",I've already paid for this series twice. I'm willing to pay one more time for the blu extended release. Isn't that enough?
1,Do NOT buy this THEATRICAL edition--wait for the extended edition,"First, I love these movies, but am appalled by such blatant attempts to double dip, AGAIN. I was duped into buying two sets of the DVDs of these movies, and I will not let that happen again with the blu-ray editions. The studio first released the DVD sets of the theatrical versions of the movies, only to later release the extended cut versions, which are markedly better than this version. I will NOT be duped again into buying two sets of this movie. I hope this version stagnates on store shelves. Peter Jackson, New Line and Warner should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Why?!,"Really a numb-skull marketing move, and a thumb of the nose at the millions of loyal fans who made the movies a financial success. They may well lose money on this."
1,The reason corporations are so popular today,"Another horrible ""gouge the customer"" decision in which they hope you will be so gullible as to buy the theatrical version and then a few months later....surprise!!!...here's the extended version for you to buy all over again! Blu-ray has plenty of space for both versions...but customer service & value is a concept of the past. Wait for the extended version!!!!"
1,The People Have Spoken: No Double Dipping!,"Won't buy it. This is a blatant attempt at double/triple/quadruple dipping. The movies are good, but not good enough to buy four times. Fail."
1,Horrible business practice,"I wish companies would stop attempting to milk the customers by treating them like they are dumb. Here is a hint, put out your best quality product every time and people will like you more."
1,Do you think they'll stop at double dipping?,"Of course I find this kind of multiple-bites-at-the apple product distribution insulting. I have no intention of buying the theatrical release _AGAIN_, in a new format. I, like the other 1-star-reviewers here, will wait for the extended edition on Blu-Ray.I don't have enough faith in the studio execs, however, to believe they'll stop at double dipping. Eventually they'll release the extended editions on Blu-Ray, we'll all snap it up eagerly, and then, and only then, will they probably release a THIRD edition - the do-deca-double secret probation edition, with fifteen extra minutes of footage they just couldn't include in the extended edition. Maybe after that a FOURTH edition, where the end credits use a slightly different font, and a much-sought-after FIFTH edition, where they cut the ridiculous sequence with Legolas elephant-surfing.And we'll probably get suckered into buying them all, in turn. (I'd buy the fifth, one, honestly)"
3,Good but extended version is better,The set is great for the price but if I had it to do over I would have spent the extra money and gotten the extended edition.
1,More of my money?,"As much as I want the LOTR Trilogy on Blu-ray, I urge everyone to hold out for the extended release. I'm so tired of film companies trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me. I already own the theatrical versions on DVD, then I scooped up the extended versions when they came out. Now I'm supposed to buy this trilogy a 3rd time for the theatrical blu-ray and buy a 4th time for the extended blu-ray??? I'll pass. New Line, let me know then the extended versions come out on blu-ray and then you can have some more of my money. =("
1,Not as good as the extended edition.,"Enough said, the extended versions (that I have in standard DVD format, and that are 5 stars) are the way Peter Jackson (the director) intended the movie to be seen and not the theatrical version (this product here getting 1 star)."
1,+1 For Extended,"I bought the original versions on standard def, and then the extended versions on standard def. I've seen them. I just want to watch them with a better picture and sound quality. Holding out for Extended Editions on Blu-Ray ..."
1,Where is the Extended Extended version?,"Every body who is a die-hard LOTRs fanatic knows that there is an Extended extended version out there dying to be made! Where is that scene between Arwen and Elrond we were teased with on the theatrical release, but that never showed up on the Extended? Bless Peter Jackson's heart, making these films almost killed him, but honey, it's time to make it already. My husband and I would cheerfully sit through 3 five hour movies of our beloved Middle Earth. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO LONG WHEN IT COMES TO LOTRs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,agree w/ others!,"though I don't own this yet but from reading most of the comments, I tend to agree with the majority on this subject that the company is extremely greedy by not including the extended version. They already made most of their money on the non-bluray dvd's trilogy and all, I'm debating whether to get the bluray version the way it is, let alone have to get the different bluray versions just to get the extended clips??? people need to boycott this version and wait for the lates all included version.Sliger! if you have money to waste, good for you, don't call other names."
1,"Vomit -Who needs another killum, guts, deat video game ??","Both the book and the ""Lord of the Rings"" movie are just video vomit game fighting and killing. The Hobbit on the other hand has interesting character development and humor. Lord of the Rings belongs on the very bottom of fantasy literature and video. I prefer pinball any day. Nothing about the Lord of the Rings approaches the literary power of Harry Potter."
1,Dissapointed to the point of disgust.,"I am completely disgusted that New Line would pull a move like this. Though I'm not surprised, it just makes me furious.At first, New Line was strictly ""HD"" format, and when Blu-ray took over, New Line decided to hop on the bandwagon because they knew it was going to be the standard hi-def format. So having to wait for them to even put this film trilogy on Blu-ray, and only release the Theatrical editions makes me wanna spit in the face of New Line.I'm giving a 1-star rating because I'm not giving in to purchase the washed-down version of the film. I'll wait until the extended editions are released. And it better be worth the wait, like give us some extra footage, and extras or something. Easter Eggs!"
1,Pure greed and bull,"Add my name to the ""Enough is enough !!!!! I'm mad as hell and im not gonna take it! Fool me once,shame on you.."" list."
1,Outrageous!,"This is absolutely reprehensible. What a despicable, and appallingly obvious cash grab. To once again blatantly attempt to STEAL from consumers worldwide by first releasing the theatrical version of LotR on BluRay and then, after having bilked people out of that money, THEN release the extended version of the movies on BluRay. It makes me ill."
1,rip off do not buy wait on extended version,"I am also one of the persons who considers this a rip off they made billions of dollars off these movies, and they want to milk the consumers for more money i will not buy this bluray untill the extended version comes out."
1,I will not buy the theatrical release again!,"i will rent it with my online account just to experience it in blu-ray, but i will not buy it. I do not support corporate quadruple-dip greed."
1,Greed should not be rewarded,"As much pain as it will cause me to wait another year to see my favourite movies (extended) in blue-ray glory, none of us should give in to this cynical and downright nasty marketig ploy. Who hasnt already bought these movies at least once ? We should be sending our views on this debacle directly to the studio too. A hundred stars for the movies, zero for greed."
1,Doesn't take advantage of Blu's offerings.,"This set will leave you dissappointed due to the fact that it is only the theatrical edition. New Line will be releasing the extended cut a while after this one, it's to fool you into having to buy two sets instead of just one. This product is a gesture of feeding a loyal fanbase with incomplete material. There is a DVD version of the extended cut...since when does Blu-ray offer anything less than the DVD counterpart? Talk about trying to capitalize on your customers.For everyone who like a complete package just wait for New Line to bring out the Extended Cut and you will save yourself $100, but if you like buying things twice then buy this."
1,Seriously?!,"I can think of no valid reason why the extended versions of the trilogy are not on this release--none at all. So when the powers that be come to their senses after seeing this backlash, and release the REAL Blu-Ray version, only then will I fork over my hard earned jack to buy it."
1,theatrical editions only? wtf?,this is not the one to buy. will wait for extended editions. double dippin money gobblin crap. very disapointed.
1,Do not buy,"Thanks New Line, but you aren't going to sucker me into buying another version of this trilogy when you finally release the extended versions in a few months. Nice try."
1,Extended version,Thank goodness for these reviews! Not having the extended version on Blu-Ray is ridiculous at this time. I will hold out for the extended version only.
1,Wait for the extended versions,I can't believe its taken this long for any version of these movies to come out on bluray and its not even the extended versions. Sign up to be notified for the extended versions instead and don't waste your money here.The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray
1,New Line Cinema is milking the franchise at the fans' expense,"Given how long both the extended edition DVD trilogy has been out and considering how long it's been since Blu-Ray won the format war, New Line Cinema has no reason to withhold the Blu-Ray extended edition. There are no technical difficulties here; the cuts of the source material have already been made and just like the DVD versions, the extended versions could have been included as a viewing option using the same disc.This theatrical release is only meant to entice customers into another purchase before New Line Cinema chooses to release the Blu-Ray Extended Edition Trilogy. This type of salesmanship is a REALLY low move by New Line Cinema.I intend to vote with my lack of purchase until they release the Blu-Ray Extended Edition Trilogy. I suggest you do the same."
1,Blast your hides to Hades! No double dip for me...,I think it is appalling to think that we will double buy the Blu Ray set.GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSIONS!
1,Dont buy this product,"this LoTR bluray version is horrible. We will not waste our money on this version.Also, image quality of this version seems to be very low (not high definition as could be, considering it is bluray).Bonus material not in bluray (what are you thinking??)Release the extended version and make real entertainment for fans and collectors."
2,Yar! Keelhaul tha scallywags!,To Davey Jone's locker wi' these garbage scowl rejects! True pirates and their wenches will be waitin' fer tha extended editions. New Line 'll be walkin' tha plank til then! Yar!
1,Please give me one version to rule them all !,"Im sure Frodo would throw this version into the firery chasm of Mount Doom. Newline , come forth and forge a master blue ray to rule them all."
1,"LOTR nut, but enough is enough...","I will add my 2 cents worth. I have both extended and theatrical on DVD, always bought them on the day they came out. But as so many have said; why not both on one BR disk? I will wait for BR extended and pass on this one."
1,Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me!,"I bought ""LOTR"" in theatrical and extended versions already. This is just a Greedy RIP-OFF by the movie studio. WAIT until the extended Bluray version is released Before buying! Probably around Christmas."
1,Want the extended versions!,"My favorite film series ever, and one of the few that I would upgrade to blu-ray, but after seeing the superb extended version DVDs, anything less just feels incomplete, and I am NOT being suckered into buying this twice again."
1,This is insulting.,Please vote with your dollars and don't give into this gimped version. Wait for the REAL version of this trilogy.
1,Rediculous.,It is terrible for companies to try to trick consumers into buying 2-4 different versions of the same product. I have no problem with upgrading from dvd to bluray but releasing this set just like it was done on dvd trying to confuse buyers into buying something that they might not really want are horrible business practices.
1,Worthless!,Please do not buy this. It will just get them sex crazed and retard strong to keep doing this to us. Who wants the theatrical version when its run time is long anyways. Might as well go for it all since you are taking the time to watch it!
1,Will only buy the Theatrical Version if less than $24 for all 3,"I refuse to give-in and buy the Theatrical Version, unless it will cost less then $8 for each one or $24 or less for all three...only to hold me over.COME ON PETER JACKSON, Pull your weight to help us with the cost. In fact, GET the Extended Edition out instead; it's not like you don't already have it available."
1,Join the Boycott,There is no reason why New Line should not release the extended editions as well and give people a choice. They are banking on making oodles of cash by offering both at different times. The best way to handle this as consumers is to boycott this version and wait for the extended versions.
1,Will Wait !,"Is it they have not made enough money off this movie ? Will wait for the full edition ! Just sound's like and is GREED ! Amazon need's a No Star Choice , 1 star is way to high ..."
1,agreed w/ greed,"NOt releasing the extended version in the same set, or at least at the same time is simply lame."
1,Where are the Extended Versions?,"Not falling for this again. While I don't mind having both versions on DVD, if I am going to sit down for the best video viewing experience it will be with the Extended Editions. I'll hold off on Blu-Ray until then."
1,Give us the EXTENDED editions!,"This review is in support of the review by C. Burns ""The Dude."" I rated this item 1 star because the movie companies are keeping the extended Blu Ray editions hostage until we buy the theatrical versions. The movie itself gets 5 stars, but this theatrical ONLY product gets 1."
4,Don't hold your breath: EE's delayed due to 'The Hobbit' delay,"The rumor has always been that the LOTR-EEs on BD would be released around the time 'The Hobbit' hit theaters or BD itself. But the latest news is that production on 'The Hobbit' has been delayed by at least a year. Thus pushing back the EE's to at least 2012 or more. So, shall ye spend $65 now for the TE's or go without your LOTR fix on BD for several more years? Yes, most people might say, ""I'll wait"", but really folks...are ye that frugle?So with that out of the way, I give this release 4 stars for the films, (minus 1 star for the inevitable double-dip.) I'm sure this will be a great set with great extras and pristine VC-1 transfers with DTS-MA sound."
5,"THIS IS A REGULAR DVD, NOT BLUE RAY!","I don't understand all the people complaining about this being a standard edition Blue Ray. The product description says FULL SCREEN DVD, not blue ray."
4,Blu ray review .,"I think they did a pretty good job upgrading these great movies, I can only ecko what other people that had actually bought and watched the blu rays already have said the 1st.looks very good the 2nd. looks even better and the 3rd. looks great and they all sound AWESOME!"
1,Extended Please!!!,I'm going to hold out for the Extended Editions. Please just put both the Theatrical and Extended in one set.
1,Not buying until extended versions come out,"I have no intnetion in buying this until the extended versions come out. Better yet as others have stated put both into the box set even if you have to charge a bit more, do it right the first time!"
1,Please think of the Grandparents!,"All I can think about is the poor lady who wants to buy her grandchildren a great gift and so when she stops in to Ri-CV-greens she sees one of those hand-wavy-motion-bowling machines that all the kids are into these days, then noticing it's only $30, she thinks ""I thought these things were at least a couple benjamins! This must be my lucky day!"" and buys it. Of course this thing is a worthless knockoff, bestowed with only the cheapest parts of the original, and then when the kiddos come over to gramma's house for Chris-Hannu-wanzaa, there is nothing but disappointment and confusion as the kids feel gypped and gramma feels cheated and embarrassed.Is that what you want to do Warner? Do you want to make my Grandmother cry?Just release the extended versions. Save us all the heartache. It's the right thing to do."
1,Heartless,"At what point is enough ,enough??? Does this industry really think it's loyal customers are just fodder?"
1,Boycott Warner's 'Milking' Tactics,We need to make a stand against corporate Milking.Skip the Theatrical and wait for the Extended.
1,Why?!,"I bought both versions on DVD and was incredibly upset they did so. I will not be buying EITHER version AGAIN. Now I see they are doing it again. I will not buy two versions of the same movie at full retail price!!! I love these movies, but I am fine with my DVD collection."
1,Vote with your $,"Vote with your $ and don't buy the (Theatrical Editions) even if they are offered for one penny with free shipping, no tax and a free copy of the DVD Theatrical Editions thrown in . Let them sit on the shelf and rot. Let them take the loss for even thinking of releasing this version again."
1,"Let's just wait for the extended edition, shall we?","How about releasing the extended addition, with an option to view the theatrical versions... instead of the marketing strategy of hoping everyone will repeat history by buying both."
1,Shame on you New Line,If you read this New Line you should be ashamed of your self and you wont get me dipping into my wallet 2x. Give me what I want both versions in the same box set and I would pay a some more for that. Shame Shame Shame.. Zero stars for you
5,Epic movies!,These are awesome movies and I highly recommend buying thisboxed set. I couldn't be happier with the packaging and all the extras!
1,More Games from Corporate Headquarters,"This negative review is just to add to the overwhelmening objection to the release of the theaterical versions of these great films rather than the extended. Why not a complete package with both right now? We know it is coming? Why are you trying to cheat people out of their money, especially in this economy?"
1,Sound is useless,I cannot adjust the sound level high enough to hear the dialog clearly. Useless product.
1,"10 stars for the movies, 0 for the product of greed!",Totally agree with all the fans/customers reviews. Greed is bad dear Hollywood Gollums! Don't you watch and learn from your own (and not that many) wise movies?!
1,Corporate Greed,"I fully concur! We are all sick of the same corporate rip-off attitude that is prevalent today. it is time we, as consumers stand up to all corporate thieves. I will not buy this product, until they include the extended version as well on blue ray."
1,Rip-off by New Line,I already bought both versions released on DVD; I will not be ripped off again. Everyone please wait for the extended version.
1,I won't buy it.,I won't buy a half-muled product just to turn around and buy it again. I might buy the full extended version but not this one.
1,Another vote for extended versions,"I'm a huge fan and I've been waiting for Bul-Ray versions for a long time, but I'm not buying until they release the Extended Versions on Blu-Ray"
1,Waste of time and money,"Why would anyone buy a blue ray version of the shortened version of this masterpiece. Obviously blue ray aficianados are a bit geeky by nature and would want the whole shebang. Don't waste your time, but do join me in shaking my head in disbelief that they would even put out this as a first offering. I hope Peter Jackson had nothing to do with this as his fans are getting p*ss off."
1,Don't screw us fans with the bogus theatrical release again!,When are the studios going to realize that through the power of social media the people have a voice!Get on with releasing the extended version already!
1,Bring Us EE Already,"Love the movies all 3 are in my top 5 of all time along with Titanic and Gone W/ the Wind. But the EE are really what I loved, they can keep the TE."
1,"No Extended Edition, No Sale","Honestly, why are they even bothering with the theatrical editions? Anyone that cares enough about these movies to spend this kind of money for them on BR will want the Extended Editions, which are the only versions that exist as far as I'm concerned."
1,Don't Buy! Wait for the Extended Editions.,"I mistakenly pre-ordered this set before reading the reviews. After realizing that this set only contains the theatrical editions, I quickly canceled the order and will wait for the extended edition."
1,PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR BUYING,I bought these on the recommendation page. I was rapidly clicking and missed the fact that these are NOT the extended editions. I asked to exchange and was surprised that they did not release the extended editions onto Blu-Ray. I cannot believe that the movie studios are going to milk the money out of blu-ray like they do with DVD's. Blu-Ray already costs MORE then a regular DVD and to double dip is just despicable.
1,Don't be duped,"It's simple. The extended version of LOTR is about 50 times better than the regular version, and the extended version will be coming out on blu-ray in the not so distant future. Don't blow your money on this one, and don't encourage New Line to release other products designed to dupe eager fans out of their money by making this one profitable. They want you to get impatient and blow your money on this substandard version as well as the good later version. Unless, you've got a heck of a lot of money to blow or you will die from not having LOTR in HD for another year or two, stay clear and wait for the good stuff."
1,Boycott this item until the Extended Edition Comes Out,"These are my favorite movies of all time, but I will not buy them until they release the extended edition on Blu-ray. Newline, listen to the fans and give us what we want NOW!"
1,"Be part of the solution, not the problem!","This product is a complete waste of time and money.The only reason they are not releasing the extended editions on Blu (for which they know we've been waiting for years now) concurrently with this package is that they know that no one will buy the latter. Anyone fan enough to buy these movies, moreso to upgrade from DVD to Blu, is not going to be one of those who complains about their length, much less one who is happy to see less of the story.Studios continue to see profit in the multi-dip strategy because there are too many people with no restraint and money to burn.DON'T BE ONE OF THEM!"
1,Marketing Rip-Off,Place both Theatrical and Extended versions of the trilogy in one Blu-Ray package and price it accordingly. 'New Line' needs to re-think this product offering and do it properly.
1,I'll wait!,I'll be on a mission to keep anyone from buying this double-dip movie. Every movie/DVD/Blu-Ray/AV forum on the net is up in arms. I'll visit every site pawning this version and review it poorly.
1,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money,"Shame on Warner Brothers. The original double-dip was understandable due to the extra features and Peter Jackson re-editing the movie for the extended cuts. This, however, is a shameful grab for money. Warner Brothers should abandon this set, and create a COMPLETE Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray package that includes both the Theatrical version and Extended versions of the movie, and all the extras from both sets of discs..."
5,Fan Paradise,"If you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy why dont you have this box set!?!? This set of 12 disc is an incredible expansion on the amazing films by Peter Jackson.Each movie is extended and re-edited by Peter Jackson himself, and all new scenes are 100% complete, with all new special effects and even a new musical score by Howard Shore.Each new scene is an expansion on the film, with some minor changes that slow down the movie in general but bring the films closer to the original novels by J.R.R Tolkien. As far as the movies themselves the only real annoyance is the way some of the scenes are re-cut, but other than that the new scenes are great. (If you want to know everything)The bonus discs are packed with more features and documentaries than anyone could possibly have the time for, and no part of the process is overlooked.A+ for a great expansion on the films. (And for the price Amazon has it why not get these DVD's)"
1,"Fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again!","There's an old saying in Tennessee -- I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee -- that says, fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again."
1,wow,I cant believe beside making us wait this long for the blu ray version they re going to try to nickel and dime people. At least bring out the extrended version the same time to let people decide instead of making us wait.
1,NO EXTENDED VERSION <<NO SALE>>,"I was happy when I saw the E-Mail, ""Lord of the Rings"" Blue Ray now available; Then my smile turned to a horrid frown when I saw ""Theatrical Release"". What is the point of making a Blue Ray copy without the extended material. The only customers who are going to upgrade to blue ray when they already have the movies on DVD are the avid fans and if I'm an avid fan I WANT THE GOOD STUFF. This was an appalling decision by the studio, I hope they don't make to many prints, because you can count me out until they make Blue Ray copies of the extended Versions !!!"
1,Extended or nothing,"Please do everyone a favor and don't buy this. That way the studio is forced to come out with the extended version sooner. If you must buy this, buy it used once it becomes available."
3,Problema en Subtitulos,"Recibi el paquete, pero con la sorpresa de que la pelicula ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" no contiene subtitulos en Español, como indica el resumen del producto."
1,Same as all the rest.,Terrible waste of Blu-Ray capabilities. They can't spend the money to release two versions of the same 3 movies on one Blu-Ray set? Tired of being screwed by the Hollywood crowd.
1,Boo to the distributors and producers,"I cannot believe that with the Blu-Ray technology that exists today that both versions of this movie weren't released in the same package. OK, ask for another $10 in price if you will but this is just lousy. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you. I hope this release sits on shevles forever as a tribute to the stupidy of those that think they can do something to the public TWICE. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!! Force them to release the EXTENDED version instead with the theatrical."
1,Greedy Company,I just want to add to the countless reviews on this product. It is terrible they are doing the exact same thing as they did when releasing the DVDs. They never told us an extended version was coming out and we all bought the theatrical versions thinking that was it....Now we are smarter and KNOW they will release the extende version at some point. But this is a terrible way of trying to rip people off. Make the extended version along with the original at the same time. Don't try to make us double dip this crap.The extended versions are TREMENDOUSLY better. Believe all the reviews.
1,I will not be duped again,"I agree, both the theatrical and extended editions should be put into one package. I am not going to buy both versions again. I will be prefectly fine watching them on my DVD version until they do the right thing, and I will not spend my hard earned dollars until then. Please put both version onto one blu-ray, we are not idiots."
1,100% Agree with the majority,"They take such a long time to release a product I [and we, im assuming] want. But we all know the superior versions will be out in a year.."
1,Bad move,"Bad move. Sort of like selling full frame instead of widescreen products. Dupe the Rubes and bilk the Fans. Not the sort of thing an otherwise dedicated and passionate film maker like Peter Jackson should associate himself with. Should have built the disks with the option to watch it either way, or released them, at the same time with the short versions at a discount and the extended at a premium. Good thing people are using the internet to shine the light on these kinds of practices.But hey, if its good enough for Lucas and Spielberg why not Jackson."
1,Caveat emptor - this is theatrical edition only,Just adding my 1-star review to the many others here because I agree that releasing only the theatrical edition on Blu-ray -- when clearly both the theatrical and extended editions are available and could be released together -- is deliberately greedy and/or deceptive.
1,Give Me the Extended Version or Give Me Nothing!!!,I agree with the original poster. This is just another example of Corporate America trying to rip us off. The extended versions will be available soon enough...and I'd rather pay big bucks to have the complete set -rather than purchase three movies with hours of footage chopped out.
1,We're not stupid,I think I will wait until the extended editions come out on blu ray- thank you very much
1,Why are we disappointed?,"for my review, I'm re-posting a response to the questions; ""How can we be disappointed when we love the movies in the theaters?"" & ""Are we just hard to please?""I agree with the reviews. Most who have watch the extended version a few times will be disappointed. To answer the question ...how can we be disappointed when we we thrilled when we saw it in the theaters?If you have ice cream for the first time it taste great. You then have ice cream with strawberries or hot fudge on top.... you are then promised a special treat for your birthday... you are going out for ice cream! ...you are then told you can only have the vanilla even though they have the other flavors right behind the counter... yes vanilla ice cream is still great and yes there will be some who will prefer the plain vanilla... but you still may be disappointed.what if they were to release the blu-ray version with great picture but only stereo or mono sound? Would we still be hard to please?"
1,I CALL BSSSSSSS!!!,WAIT for the extended edition where you'll most likley have an option to watch the theatrical edition by just toggling a button. Going to blockbuster to borrow it for now lol.
1,Bamboozled by the gall of the studios,"Seriously now I can not believe the stuidos are trying to pull this sham again for the second time on this series of movies. I will not for any reason purchase this version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on Blu-ray.The reasoning behind Bluray format is that more information can be put on one disc therefore I know as well as many other people that the stuido could have fit both the theatrical and extended editions into one set. I would have been more than willing to purchase this set if that were the case. I hope the fact that this is yet another one star rating, and that is only becasue I could not rate it lower, on this title will help the studios realize that we are not as stupid as they believe we are."
1,"Extened version, where are you?","Extened editions expected release 2011-2012. I can wait, I hope you all do too... it will be worth it."
1,WAIT FOR IT!,"Do not buy this product just yet, wait for the extended version of the movies then buy the blue ray addition. SHAME ON THEM FOR RELEASING IT THIS WAY only to later release the extended version."
1,Bad New line!,DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!!!
1,What - no extended version yet?,"I too will boycott this release. There is no reason that I can see - other than greed on the part of New Line - for this release to not contain the extended versions. Buying this merely ""theatrical"" cut-down version would be like buying a ""fullscreen"" DVD instead of a ""widescreen"" DVD in terms of missing content.As fans we do not get our money's worth unless the extended version is offered, and New Line know this. C'mon, don't try to make us re-buy this shortened and adulterated theatrical crap now and then expect us to re-buy again when you do finally release the Bluray extended version. This time homey won't play that game. I am firmly waiting for the extended blu-ray and will NOT buy this theatrical one. YMMV"
1,Why not extended??,I was so excited when I saw they were finally releasing LOTR on Blu-ray now I am just bummed that it is not the extended addition!!! What a waste of time and money!!!
1,unacceptable,"The studio should be ashamed, I was just on FYE and this item is even listed with the word ""Extended"" in the description. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!"
1,Insulting,"What, Warner? Do you think we are all morons? You released the extended edition on DVD years ago. Since that footage obviously exists in an edited form, do you really think we would forget about it and buy the theatrical release again just because it's in high definition?We will not be duped into your double-dip attempt. Either release the extended edition on Blu now, and profit from it, or you will wait for my money."
1,Waste of money.,"I mean for real, if you're gonna spend this amount of money on this item why not pay a little more and get the extended edition. I think it was a real waste of time and money for the production company to create this specific version on blu-ray. What was the point??"
1,I will not purchase theatrical version!!!,"The LOTR was a great trilogy. It was great at the theater. I enjoyed renting them from Netflix. When the extended version was released, I purchased it immediately. I will not purchase the theatrical version on Blu-Ray. When the extended version becomes available on Blu-Ray, then I will make a purhcase. Hmmm, maybe I will rent the Blu-Ray from Netflix..."
1,Let's knock this DOWN to ONE STAR!!!,"Once again New Line is trying to rip us off. Why in the world would we want the THEATRICAL version on Blu Ray. Just like they did with the DVD they are realeasing this version FIRST, only to sell us the EXTENDED version next year or so. New Line should can be shown by US (the consumer) that we will not tolerate this kind of marketing. Give this item ONE star and don't order it. Send New Line the message."
1,Rip off,"We all know LOTR is great, but I refuse to pay for the theatrical version while they're withholding the extended version AGAIN. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me..."
1,Horrible They Don't Have the Extended Version!,"I am simply miffed that they don't have the extended version, and that they are now saying it won't be released until 2010 or 2011! Do they think that will make me want to buy the theatrical version? It only makes me more angry."
1,Ditto,"I'm just adding to the fray. I'll wait for the extended versions. I probably would have bought this version on Blu if it had been released earlier, but since Jackson has already commented that it'll be 2010 before this one is released, I'll just live with my DVD's for now."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! BUY THE EXTENDED,"""The Lord of the Rings (Extended Editions)"" is scheduled to be released on Blu-ray in 2011 or 2012."
1,"Don't let the movie company ""George Lucas"" us!!!","It's the same thing George Lucas does, and it sucks! Don't let them win by making us buy twice! I agree that we should wait until they release the extended editions. I waited and didn't buy ANY of the Star Wars movies on DVD, I stuck with my faithful VHS tapes. And FINALLY, I hear that they're coming to Blu Ray as a complete anthology. If we do this with LOTR, we'll get the version we deserve! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,Corporate Greed run amok,"Sad and transparent money grab by the studios, they have every right to release this version, the consumer has every right not to spend their hard-earned cash on it. Money talks, don't give the studios your money four times for four different versions. Wait for the extended version on blu-ray!"
1,Studio Rip-off,Waiting for the extended version so I dont need to buy it twice! Made that mistake with the standard DVDs...
1,Joining the pack,"Just like the other 2800+ reviewers, I can't imagine what they were thinking by not including the full extended versions of the films. If these ratings are any indication, this could quite possibly be the worst selling release of a blockbuster group of films.Do you suppose anyone that can affect it is even noticing?"
1,Why oh why New line?,"Hey people at New Line. People only buy new videos when they are better than what is currently out there. And hint hint...Blu-ray is not better than the extended edition. If someone bought the extended edition, they will probably not fork out money for the regular edition on Blu-Ray. We all know why you are releasing this first one years before the extended editions come out. To make more Monies!!!! And we won't buy it. We are all pissed about this. All the fans. All the people who were going to buy this masterpiece. Well we are all telling you to shove it. You are going to print these discs, they will sit on the shelves, and then ultimately, you will have to cut prices to sell it. Sure they will sell like hotcakes in the walmart bargain bin, but don't plan on enthusiasts (your biggest audience) buying these ""updates"" to the franchise.Your NPV on this film just dropped by several million dollars."
1,Won't be fooled again,"I fell for this the first time they pulled it, I am not buying two versions of the trilogy again."
1,Seller description was WRONG,Very upset when I received this product. NO WHERE in the details did it say it was blue ray!! All it said was DVD. The case was all scratched up as well. Not happy about this.
1,"A ""Lucas"" style release...",I don't have to add much to what everybody else have been saying. They've released the version nobody wants in hope to make more money. George Lucas couldn't have done it any better.
1,Yawn...Who Needs it?,"I've been a big Lord of the Rings fan since reading the original US Ballantine Edition (c 1965).I waited 35 years for the trilogy to be released in movie form, and as C.S. Lewis once said about the books, they were ""good beyond hope"".And such a bargain! I would have ever-so-gladly paid five times what I paid to see these movies in the theatre.I bought the theatrical version DVDs knowing full well that I would be buying extended editions several months later.But once I did, I haven't touched the theatrical versions since.I don't mind New Line making money. They made it all possible. But they have to provide a product I want. And I don't want Blu-Ray theatrical versions. Who would? Save your money, or get the extended version DVDs instead if you don't already have them. I'm still very happy with mine; they look great when upconverted through my Blu-Ray player."
1,Capitalism at it's finest!!,Why should any of us be suprised? I must have bought 15 different freakin versions of Star Wars! I am sure New Line noticed how well that business model worked.
1,Not extended!?,"Why not release the extended editions? It's what the people want anyway! I, along with millions more, haven't watched the theaterical editions since... the theater!"
5,True LOTR fans will want BOTH versions,True LOTR fans want both the original theatrical AND extended versions. I'm buying both.
1,"All of this has happened before, and it will happen again.","For Blu-ray, they should have provided all the movies with both their theatrical and extended editions. I agree with all the other viewers on how we got ripped off on the DVDs. I would not have bought the theatrical editions if I knew the extended editions were coming. Never again!!!And just wait another couple years and there will be the Blu-ray 3D theatrical edition followed by the Blu-ray 3D extended edition. And when the next new technological advance occurs, it will repeat. To quote Battlestar Galactica - ""All of this has happened before, and it will happen again."""
1,"Darn WB, not really New Line","This is ridiculous... another release. Even Peter Jackson himself was disgusted with what WB is trying to do. Since they saw what New Line Cinema did and raked in the bucks. They wanted to do it as well and screw us fans over. At least New Line Cinema did the mistake first and actually had motives for it. But WB is just a piece of doo doo company. The only thing that has come out of that studio is the Dark Knight, hahaha. I wonder how much money they are losing for producing a senseless BluRay copy of a great film. I wont even buy the EE BluRay editions when we have heard from Porras & Jackson interview saying there is WAY more footage left over. Im waiting for The Hobbit and LOTR combo."
1,no extended edition??,"i'm not going for the regular edition. the studio needs to go all the way with their product. if not, i won't go all the way in buying their products. i'll hold off until they get the extended edition later. for now, one star."
2,The fellowship and king movies are pretty good.,Felloship is good two towers sucked and king is decent but has sum dum parts in it.
1,This is terrible,"I looked to see if the extended was on Blu-Ray and saw this and what New Line was doing. Yeah, I'm jumping on this bandwagon as well. This is a pretty crappy thing they are doing in trying to milk us for more money. I hope this decision of theirs makes them lose money. Come out with the extended in this format and you are welcome to my money. Until then...goodbye."
1,There's no way I'm buying this.,"Though I do prefer the theatrical version to the extended version for the sake of my attention span, I still want the option of viewing either one in the same package."
1,This I will not buy.,"The reason I bought the theatrical version in the plain DVD version was that it was the only version available. I then bought the Extended Edition because - for my money - It was a significant enough improvement of the story telling of this quite important story for me to invest in it.I can presently watch my regular 480P Extended Edition LOTR's DVD's in a relatively inexpensive DVD player that upconverts them to 1080P and watch them in High Definition with an acceptable amount of personal satisfaction.Then I will see what extra value is provided in the EE blu-ray edition (whenever it comes out), and then I will decide if I will buy that or not.But this, this I will not buy."
1,Garbage,"Thanks for nothing. Anyone who buys this is a sucker. Cash grab by the studios plain and simple. A full, extended, all bluray disc collection of these films is what the fans want. This is garbage."
1,This is low!,"For a series of movies this grand I can almost buy the explanation ""The extended/director's cut was not ready at the regular release date, so we're releasing the special edition now x months after the regular release""NO WAY this is the case now.We all like to think the studios put some pride into their works and are fellow movie lovers.The truth is that they're a bunch of greedy SOB's who would sell their mother for a buck and couldn't care less about quality and just spew out one recepie movie after another.However, this title is not tatally uninteresting but the $100 retail price is f-ing nuts. The Amazon price of $64 still high.I would consider buying this if it cost $30."
1,the worst kind of filth,"This is not the full version of the movie. It is the theatrical version. Some people say they prefer it, that it is better paced and that the added scenes of the extended edition are just filler. Well if that's how you feel than you are clearly not a true fan and should not watch this movie at all. This version should not even exist. It is a foul abomination from the blackest pits of hell and I hope that those responsible are brought to justice, though Im not sure a punishment that would entail a suitable quantity of suffering as recompense for this astral horror can even be devised. The theatrical version has caused me to awake at night shrieking in utter terror for hours on end. Dont buy this. Whatever you do. It will haunt you for the rest of your days."
1,What a disappointment,"In addition to the fact that this Blueray trilogy only contains the theatrical release (as reviewed elsewhere), I also found that certain scenes showed their CG origins and came off as cartoonish in Blueray format (e.g. the run through the mines of Morea with all of the orcs in pursuit). Don't know where this was a product of the Blueray format or the large screen TV but I most definitely prefer the extended release box sets I had previously purchased."
1,Wait for the extended version,Shame on the double-dippers! We spent enough and went through the double-dipping for the DVD's already.
1,Where is the Extended Editions on BLU RAY?,"Do not buy this. Same as last time, they want you to buy the weak theatrical edition, then after a million copies sold, release the version everybody wants... The extended editions on blu ray. Wait for the Extended."
1,Hate It!,"Get ready for the first rip-off ,then the extened, then the extended gift pack ,then the 10th annverisary then...."
1,Why just the theatrical?,"I'm going to have to chime in with the rest. New Line is obviously trying to get us to double dip. I'm sure they'll wait for the Hobbit's release before releasing the extended versions of movies. As much as I love LOTR, I'm holding out till the extended versions of the movies."
1,Greedy companies!,Why do they not give us the Extended version of the film? That's pure greed and selfishness - they want to make even more money! I just hate it.But the films are awesome of course!
1,"Unfair , imoral but to be expected","Maybe it is time to treat customers differently. Maybe it is time to be creative and innovative and not underestimate people's inteligence. A full version ( both theatrical and extended ) could be marketed in one package and the price, well, the price you guys decide... But to do this believing that people would just buy everything written blu ray and LOTR and then rebuy the extended version is just ... well.... unfair ... and also expected."
3,lotr box set,"While this was very nice I was disappointed that it didn't come in the box that makes it look like a book like the picture. This was a Christmas present and as we celebrated on Christmas Eve, it came that day, which made for a very nice surprise. I would buy from this seller again."
3,Lord of the Rings,"The package arrived later than I had anticipated, and the outer dustbox was not with the dvds. They were bound together by rubberbands! The movies were scratch free and in good condition, but for the money I paid for them, the box should have been included like the picture shows...or atleast he/she could have written that in the information part of the product page. They are great and very detailed dvds though!!"
1,Just a corporate fundraiser!,"On Blu-ray, both editions could appear in the same release via seamless branching. One release for both versions is what the customers want and what the technology offers, yet we are ripped off once again by the corporate powers that be. Do not buy this release. Ever."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My finger was poised over the left button, ready to click, til I looked closer. Theartical Version. I wholeheartedly agree with all the other one star reviews: this is a blatant money-grab by the studio. With the capacity of a Blu-ray, there is no reason they can't put both versions on the same disc, or release them simultaneously and let the consumer decide.I'll wait for the extended versions."
1,If I could rate zero stars I would,"I love LOTR, especially extended versions. This is simply double dipping. It's insulting and distasteful. Why don't you just release the extended versions with the theatrical in one blu-ray box set the first time ? Come on New Line be more empathetic to your consumers. This is greedy."
1,"All-in-one editions with seamless branching? Oh no, not enough profit!","Of course, there's this wonderful ability called ""seamless branching"" that has been around since DVD, where they COULD provide us with theatrical and extended edition viewing options in one package. But oh no! Then New Line couldn't double dip us again! Maybe they think they're doing us a favor by not triple or quadruple dipping like they did with the DVD editions (theatrical releases one at a time, trilogy set, extended releases one at a time, ""deluxe"" trilogy of those... phew), but let's send the message loud and clear this time.DO NOT BUY THIS SET!! IT MUST FAIL! Then, DO buy the extended set, because we're not against them profiting from something we would love, we are just against the re-re-re-re-double dipping."
1,Not falling for that again,"Having purchased two of the three movies on DVD before the Extended versions came out, and then going and upgrading to the Extended versions, I'm putting my foot down and saying ""No!"" to buying this a third time. They should know better. There is no reason for this outside of taking more of the consumers money.These people don't understand that business should work as a mutually beneficial relationship, where you provide what the customer wants and they give you what you want. Listen to the fans! This is NOT what we want!"
2,Just release the Extended version and get it over with!!!,"I want the extended version that is why I rated it a 2. They should have just given us the extended version with the option to see the shorted version already on the disks. I will not buy the shorted version on bluray in addition to the extended one later when they finally release it. I already own it on dvd. So I will buy the extended when it is released.STOP MUCKING AROUND and PUT BOTH VERSIONS (original and Extended) IN THE BOX SET. HOW HARD IS THAT????? THE STUDIO SHOULD STOP RIPPING US OFF. JUST MAKE 2 DISCS FOR EACH MOVIE AND PUT THEM IN THE BOX SET.... THAT IS 6 DISCS PEOPLE...IT IS NOT THAT HARD. THAT WAY YOU CAN WATCH WHATEVER VERSION YOU WANT. I REALLY DON""T WANT TO WAIT LIKE 20 YEARS LIKE WE DID FOR BLADE RUNNER."
1,Waiting for extended,"I bought, and kept, both sets of DVDs, because we love both versions, but it's the extended versions we keep watching. It's frustrating, but I'll hold out for the set we want."
1,Wait for the Extended Edition...,They should release both the theatrical and extended in one set. So stupid to release this theatrical edition when an extended will eventually come out.
3,A little odd,"It's great to have all the extended material, I'd never seen it before, just heard about it. But I have a problem with the disks and playback. When viewing the extended version (I didn't try the theatrical version) there is a portion of about 30 seconds on each of the disks and each side where the action speeds up and gets ahead of the sound. To get it to straighten out, I had to move the slider back to just before the bad spot one or two times to get that area to play right. Now this was on computers, not on a regular stand alone dvd player.Otherwise, I feel it was a deal for someone who just wanted to see all of the movies."
1,Quit ripping us off,"You know, this just smacks of pure greed. The Blu Ray format, while great, isn't enough for me to keep buying the same content over and over. There needs to be some value add. I will wait for the extended cut, and then, I may just rent it."
1,Double Dip,"So pleased to see the reaction from thousands of LOTR fans with this blatent double dip.My husband was really keen to get the Blu Ray Extended version for his birthday, only to find out that Peter Jackson and his money grabbing cohorts want to screw the Tolkien Classic for every $$$ they can. If the Theatrical Edition is boycotted, perhaps he'll pay attention."
1,Should I buy the third LOTR package?,I must agree to all people. It's a rip off and I want the extended version right away! There's no way I'll buy this one on BD just to buy another one next year or so.Capitalist swines!
1,This is Sauron's doing. Do not submit by purchasing this inferior edition.,"It's simple - Don't bother with the theatrical versions of the LOTR. Wait until they release the Extended Editions on Blu-Ray. That, or wait for the inevitable ""Super Deuluxe More-Baggins-For-Your-Buck"" Ultimate Edition which will come with the Extended Editions of The Hobbit."
1,I will wait for the extended edition,with all the space on blu ray(25gb)both versions of the movie could have been release.
1,Why there is piracy,"I agree with all the 1 star reviews based on what they are trying to us the consumers. People wonder why there is so much piracy and this is a prime example, people releasing a regular version and wait and release an extended or unrated version. What a rip off. BTW, i love lord of the rings."
1,Theatrical Versions only?!,"Do they really expect us to buy these theatrical versions, when the extended versions will be out in the near future?! Come on, NewLine/Warners, get real! There is no reason, except for greed, that Both versions can't be available at the same time. Ridiculous!"
1,Con Artists,What a bunch of dishonest retarted punks. Why would they hold out selling the extended editions on BluRay. Greedy bastages. Now I won't even buy it when they do want to sell it that way. Nerd heads. I hope they realized their mistake.
1,Teach'm a lesson !,"Yes, let's teach those guys a lesson : boycott any BD edition of The Lord of the Rings until they release a REAL BD version, that is extented edition !Us fans shouldn't be treated like milk cows, we won't buy the set twice !"
2,"Amazing movie, why would you only want 60% of it","OK... this is, in my opinion, one of the truly great SF/Fantasy movies ever made. The cinematography is amazing, every shot means something. So WHY would you ever want to throw your money away on just over half the picture. Full-frame DVDs destroy the vision of both director and cinematographer and give you a movie which bears a passing resemblance to what they wanted you to see. Do yourself a favor, click your ""back"" button, and click on the link that says ""Widescreen edition"". Hey, that way in 3 years when you have a widescreen TV you won't have those ""annoying black bars"" on the sides of your screen all the time.(...)""Remember: with widescreen you lose part of the screen. With Full Frame you lose the director's vision and artistry."""
1,What a Waste,"Best Movie(s) of all time.....Fanatical Fans....yet, the studio thinks they can get us to buy 2 separate versions AGAIN!? No way Jack! this is a rip off. PLEASE wait for the Extended Editions!Please do not let them get away with holding the extended edition hostage until everyone buys the theatrical versions. If you agree with my review, you can do your part to exert influence on the studio by doing the following:1. Create your own 1-star review, thus increasing the number of 1-star reviews.2. Please hit ""HELPFUL"" on this review so that the producers give up this total rip-off and release the extended editions NOW along with the theatrical versions. If we don't, they'll wait YEARS to release the extended editions until they think they've bled out the last drop of money they can get out of us.3. Click ""NOT HELPFUL"" to the studio PR spokesholes who've populated this page with five star positive reviews claiming to be reviewing the movie. This PRODUCT (not the movie) blows--don't buy it."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I'm going to make this review short and simple. the movies are awesome, bought the theatrical editions when first released. later the extended editions came out and got ticked off and well, why buy the movies AGAIN? just saw the extended movies at a friend's house.the point is, this is the theatrical version. First, the extended editions are better, so I am updating my DVD library now into a Blu Ray. it's worth buying it again, just not the theatrical edition. I will wait for the Extended Edition to come out on Blu Ray. Also, its Blu Ray people!! why dont they include both versions in this Edition anyway? its not only a waste of money for the consumers, but a waste for the studio to release a version that most fans will not buy. It's up to you if you want this edition, or wait, like me, for the extended edition. hope this helps. PEACE."
1,"Just say NO, and rent it if you must.","If you can't stand to wait for the extended edition, just rent the theatrical version. Please don't buy it. This madness must stop! George Lucas has proven that the market CAN be saturated with re-releases of movies. People will finally stand up to greedy studios. If they press a million copies and no one will buy them, the price will soon drop to $30 or less anyway."
1,Waste of money!!!!,TOTAL GREED! BlueRay is the perfect format to release both extended and theatre versions. Unreal!!
1,dont get duped!!! wait for extended version!!!!,"same thing happened on dvd they release the theatrical version, a few months later they release the extended version. the version you would want if you liked the movie, which is probably why your buying it."
1,rip off,Why not release the ENTIRE versions? There's no excuse for these abbreviated versions other than greed.
1,Will only buy the extended edition blu-ray,"I stopped watching the theatrical version dvd's once the extended edition dvd's came out. I gave the theatrical versions away to a friend who liked the LOTR Trilogy short and sweet and who had never read the book.For this reason, I will not spend my money on the theatrical release blu-ray."
1,"Great Movie, but they are double dipping","The movies are 5 star, but they are trying to double dip by having you buy the theatrical version, then later, buy the better Extended version. Wait until that version is released."
1,WHY?!,"Money hungry New Line Cinema! 2011 ""Extended"" Blu-Ray Release of LoTR!!! I loved the movies, but the only reason they're doing this is that it coincide with the premiere of The Hobbit. By the time the extended versions of LoTR come out, i'm going to be so pissed off I probably wont buy them period!"
1,Don't be too Greedy! New Line!!,"i already got 2 version on DVD, you want me get another 2 version on Blu-ray?????? come on!!!! it is a great movie but why you want to torture your fans?"
1,Thanks once again Peter. We knew we couldn't have expected anything less,"Seriously, WHY is Peter Jackson slowly letting him become a George Lucas clone? It started off with those crappy 2006 re-releases. Thankfully we're getting the Blu-Ray, which actually is a good thing, because if there's one trilogy that would look amazing in Blu-Ray, it's Lord or the Rings. But WHY WHY WHY are only getting the THEATRICAL VERSIONS?!?!?!?!?? Now I love these movies. I saw them all twice in the theater. But the EXTENDED EDITION is what we want, people!!!!! Now almost 3 years ago when the 2006 DVD Re-releases came out I stated that I owned both cuts and will not buy a third one. I want the movie on Blu-Ray as much as the next guy, but seriously can't they just include both cuts on one disc? Blu-Ray has more capacity than an average DVD. Therefore, this is ridiculous. I'm a sucker for Blu-Ray, but honestly. WAIT UNTIL THE EXTENDED EDITION BLU-RAY RELEASES GET ANNOUNCED!!!!"
1,"No New Line, NO!","Double dipping is NOT acceptable. Release the EE immediately, skip this theatrical release version."
1,wasnt fooled the first time,"Thankfully, I worked in a video store when the Theatrical Editions were released on DVD, so I was able to wait for the extended before purchasing. I actually sort of surprised that New Line would try to fool everyone again since most everyone knows about the extended cuts on DVD. I will definitely not be purchasing the theatrical edition on blu-ray."
1,Wait for the Extended version,Yes it is Blu Ray but why buy the theatrical now and then extended later. Just buy the Blu Ray extended and rent the Blu Ray or borrow it from someone who was suckered into buy one if you want to see the clarity and hear the great sound of Blu Ray.
1,Shame on New Line,Everything that needs to be said has already been said by other reviewers. Wait for the extended version.
1,What are they thinking???,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BLU-RAY!!! We need to send a message that we don't want to be double-dooped anymore! Please do not buy this set. . . wait for the Extended Version instead!
1,Why not extended version?,"It's a shame...If we are going to buy another LOTR box, we will look for Blu-ray with extended versions, not the original cut and a lot of less interesting features used just to justify multiple discs. I will keep my DVDs, not to say that in my country the extended versions were never released in DVD, those versions were available only on theathers. I thought blu-ray was finally my chance to buy it but now I know it may take some YEARS until it is released on the new media... :("
1,Amazing waste of space,"Like all the other reviews I'm very disappointed that this version of the film has been released on blu ray with the intend to dupe consumers into double dipping later on when the extended versions are released.Sure the theatrical versions are ok and still enjoyable to watch, but from what I can see on the shelves at my local DVD store, not too many people are buying this edition. No one will be able to sell this version later when ty want to upgrade to the extended version.The price of this version seems a little steep as well, considering in a couple of months you'll be able to buy it for half the price when stores clear stock for the extended editions.Graet movie.. shame about the blu-ray release."
1,Both versions should be on this Blu-ray release,"I agree with the majority of the reviews, we should have both versions on the Blu-ray release. Clearly there is room for it and there is no effort on their side since both exist already. For the cost of Blu-ray, give us some reason to make this purchase. I'm tired of buying the same movies over and over again (thank you George Lucas). The other DVD sets were beautifully done and I can wait until the Blu-ray version is done right. My two-cents for what it's worth."
4,Good customer service,"I purchased this item for my husband as a Christmas gift but he surprised me by getting it for himself. I returned the product and recieved a refund which initially was short. But when I notified the seller, he refunded the difference. Although I did not view the product, the customer service was good."
1,Not again,"Releasing only the theatrical editions on blu-ray is a scam. No way am I buying the theatrical editions yet again just because the corporation wants me to have to buy it YET ANOTHER time when the extended editions finally hit blu-ray. For shame, New Line! Quit biting the hands that feed you."
1,laaaame,"will NOT be buying until extended is released on bluray. thanks for the heads up y'all. this movie trilogy is just about the best there is so this is a review of the bluray non-extended edition trilogy product, not the trilogy movies."
1,Ditto,"As a huge fan of this trilogy in movie and book form, I would never want to buy anything BUT the extended editions.LAME!!!"
1,Buying something else today!,"I own the 3 movies(extended format) on regular DVD. I will NOT buy these on BLu-Ray till the extended versions PLUS all the extras and more will come out. I have watched all the ""behind the scenes,"" listened to all the ""commentaries"" and love the ability to do so. This version is just an attempt to milk more money out of people during a tough economy. I think I will be buying something else today on Blu-Ray. Are you reading this you greedy executives???"
1,You don't get to double-dip me -- again!,"I bought the first DVDs. Then I had to buy them again for the extended editions -- fool me once, shame on you. Now I want them on Blu Ray, but you're not going to get away with the same deception again."
1,"I'll wait for the Extended Versions, thank you kindly.","The one star is not to denigrate the movies contained in this set, but rather to protest the decision on the studio's part to hold off on the release of the extended versions."
1,Rip off!,"Will wait for extended versions. I echo everyone's comments here. Just posting to give support. Please listen to your customers, WBs....stop ripping people off."
1,The double dipping has to STOP!,"People! The only way to watch these films is in the Extended Editions. And honestly the DVD versions look just as good on Blu-Ray as any of the BR movies I already own. Stop perpetuating the studios ability to soak the comsumers with 'supposed' better quality. If you already have the extended movies, don't worry about getting BR versions. And if you don't have the movies, wait until the jerks release the BR extended version."
1,I will only buy the extended versions.,"Yes, I bougth the theatrical dvd releases and decided to wait a few years to buy the extended versions on whathever high def format they released them. And i will wait some more. Dissapointment."
1,Don't waste your money!,Don't bother buying this set as the extended versions will be released soon enough. This set has 'RIP-OFF' written all over it!
1,Enough with the games.,"Whomever created the quote ""history repeats"" probably wasn't referring to this second attempt at a money-grab stunt by the studio... but boy does it fit. They already pulled this garbage once with the DVD release, please don't let them pull it again with the Blu-ray release. Wait for the extended edition."
1,Extended Please!,"One of my very favorite movie trilogies ever! The people have spoken New Line! Release Extended! Although, reading our reviews will add little to no impact on what New Line does. But it's still worth a shot! ;)"
1,Call this edition Gready Basterds,No way in hell will I be buying the theatrical version again. I hope the studio loses a ton of money on this particular release as the only way they will learn is with a hit to the pocketbook.
1,thieves,"at the risk of sounding redundant really, why do they have to do this, they could have easily released the extended version now, but no they want to abuse the consumersave your money and wait until the extended version is released thats what im going to do"
1,"Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.","BOO HISSSSS....Only the simple minded would consider a purchase here. Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!"""
3,No Way,"I can't believe they are doing this again. I also bought the theatrical releases on DVD before buying the extended versions when they came out. For those who haven't seen this best trilogy ever (if anybody) then I suggest waiting for the extended releases. I think it's over 40 minutes per movie that is left out of the theatrical versions, and the extended versions are so much more complete with all the background on different characters and the scenes that are left out of the theatrical versions. As for me, I'll watch my extended versions on DVD and wait on the extended blu-ray releases. I am already on the emailing list."
1,Extended only!!!,"The main reason I built my Home Theater was to enjoy LOTR in HD. I'm happy with my DVD extended editions...the only way I'm moving up to the Blu-ray version is if LOTR Extended is released on Blu. This goes for my family and friends too! I'm not quadruple dipping, but I will triple dip if New Line does whats right. I give the movie 5 stars!!! No other movie comes close!"
1,EXTENDED CUT?,GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!!GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!!GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!!GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!!GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!!GIVE US THE EXTENDED VERSION ALSO!!! RIP OFFFF
1,Needs to be Extended Edition,"They already have DVDs that have both theatrical and extended, they can do the same for blu-ray. I won't buy it until they do :) FYI the movie would get 5 stars, this product however, gets one."
1,loser movie studio execs,"Love the movies, but already bought twice! Just give us a good blu ray boxed set with all editions you M(*^&Fu*^rs!"
1,Garbage!!,GIve us the Extended version already for Crying out loud!If anyone wants the theater version ..... DVD is more than enoughDump this .... WASTE OF MONEY
1,C'MON NEW LINE!,"WHY DONT YOU RELEASE THE EXTENDED VERSIONS ALONGSIDE THE THEATRICALS???? GIVE THE CUSTOMER THE CHOICE! ANY EXCUSE YOU GIVE IS RUBBISH BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU GRABBING ALL THE MONEY YOU CAN!!! I CAN ONLY HOPE YOU MAKE A LOSS ON THESE VERSIONS. I'VE ALREADY FORKED OUT FOR BOTH VERSIONS ON DVD, AND AM NOW BEING PERSECUTED FOR ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGY. DON'T TREAT US LIKE THE MUGS YOU OBVIOUSLY THINK WE ARE."
1,Can't wait until this hits the shelves....,"....so I can turn my nose up at it and walk on by baby!To quote Monty Python: ""I fart in your general direction!""You won't be getting my money with this release.WE. WOULD. LIKE. A. BLU. RAY. TRILOGY. SET. THAT. INCLUDES. THEATRICAL. CUT. AND. EXTENDED. CUT. IN. THE. SAME. SET. OR. EXTENDED. SET. SOLD. SEPARATELY. OR. WE. DON'T. BUY.Was that clear?Good!(5 stars for the films themselves. 1 for this release.)"
1,Pure Greed,"I will not buy this product and support the studios greed.If I have to wait 2 years to get the best version of this film,then I will."
1,DO NOT BUY! GIGANTIC RIP OFF,Extended version where are you??? The studio did not offer extended version option with theatrical edition on this blu-ray!
5,"Come on New Line,give us BOTH Theatrical and Extended Cuts in one great package!","Come on now New Line,stop doing this to us,with blu ray you can put BOTH Theatrical and Extended Cuts on one Blu each with space to spare! and have a disc or two of suppilments as well,that's the way IT should be done! Give me a vote if you agree! I guess New Line knows that it's LOTR so it can release these multiple times on BLU and fans will buy! The 5 stars is for the films themselves,not what New Line is doing to the fans! GIVE US LOTR/BLU-RAY FANS WHAT WE DESERVE!!! TRUE FANS CHERISH BOTH VERSIONS!!! AFTER ALL PETER JACKSON'S KING KONG FROM 2005 HAD BOTH THEATICAL & EXTENDED VERSIONS ON IT'S BLU RAY FROM UNIVERSAL,THEY DID IT RIGHT,EVEN THOUGH THE EXTRAS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,I AS FAN WAS HAPPY!!! As we plainly see,this is New Line's biggest ""Cash Cow""(MOOOOO!),and there gonna keep on ""milking it""!!!"
1,Extended version please,"I agree. I already own the regular DVD of the extended versions, and they still look good on my Panasonic 50"" plasma. I will stay with those until the extended versions are available on BR."
1,I dont think so - Extended Only!,"I hope they dont make enough money to pay for the discs. However, I will purchase the Extended Version of this ONLY. We are not gonna be fooled again!"
1,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray],"Haven't seen the content; it's not out yet. Establish this at the outset.BUT:It's simple...I'm going to wait. They've announced how they want to start marketing the series. I say, ""no"".More waiting, more choices. Better prices.Nuff Said."
1,Don't get ripped off!,Don't get ripped off by buying the theatrical versions! Just be patient and get the extended versions when they come out. They are trying to rip you off so you have to buy both versions... AGAIN!
1,"Theatrical Version, Not Extended? NO WAY!!!!!!!","I will NOT buy this version. I'm waiting for the extended one!I've spent SO much money on these movies because they totally rock! Peter Jackson & all the crew made a masterpiece with this trilogy, but I REFUSE to buy this regular Theater version, while waiting for the Extended version.Join the movement, make your own review & rate this item a ONE STAR!!!"
5,it can't compare,its just the necessary for to live again the amazing story of Tolkien. Its a nice gift and its ok if you dont need to spend more. the price it can't compare with the fact to have this beautiful collection.
1,Theatrical edition lol,They should include a coupon for a free copy of the extended edition when they release it.
1,Disappointed once more with greed,"I bought the dvd, then the extended versions; I felt gouged then but still couldn't wait for the blu-ray, figuring it had to be extended. But the THEATRICAL Version; what blatant disrespect for the customer! I agree with the reviewer that won't buy it because of greed; I realize all will be digitized soon, so I'll settle for the beautiful HD of the regular DVD on blu-ray. Considering the theme revolves around greed, PJ should practice what he preaches."
1,Please release the extended edtion blu ray with Digital Copy!!,"Resist the urge to buy the current thaetrical editions. They have noticed fans are not happy about this and sooner or later (I think it will be sooner) they will have to release what we want..... it would be stupid not to do it, they are gonna make so much money and I will gladly pay for the extended Ver. I'm a big LOTR fan but I will not get played the way I did with the DVD version! Peace!"
2,Where is the extended?,"I agree with most that it blows that they have not released the extended and theatrical at the same time. However, I cannot give it a one star rating because I hated how much the director eff'ed up the Return of the King in the theatrical release. I hated even more what he did with the extended editions. So I am only bummed that they did not release the Fellowship and Two Towers extended."
1,Do not buy,"Personally I love the posts about these types of useless reproductions of products, and so far all that I have read is absolutely correct. just want to add one thing. Most Blu-Ray players, if not all, up-convert to 1080P, this film was not originally in Digital form. In essence your DVD in a good Blu-Ray player will look just as good. :PI used a PS3 as my Blu-Ray player. I'm telling you buy DVD's for all old movies made prior to SW Episode III, you will save tons of $$$ and get almost the same result."
1,Theatrical Edition?,New Line Cinema must be absolutely insane! How can they not release the Extended Edition? Do they expect people to buy this and then buy the double priced Directors Cut in a couple years? This is a complete ripoff and I hope people don't buy this set!
1,Milking it,"Just wanted to add to the hundreds out there, that I will not buy LoTR until the extended edition is released. Use a dual-layed disc and release it already!"
1,re-release agony,Physical media is becoming irrelevant anyway...are these the same people that re-release the rolling stones catalog over and over again and expect us to pay time and time again for the same product. These aren't the droids you're looking for;)
1,Not good enough,Having released extended versions of these films it's just not good enough to revert to theatrical versions for the Blu Ray release. Don't buy it!
4,Lord of the Rings DVD,"Received on time but DVD packing has slight defect. Anyway, overall acceptable."
1,Bring us both editions you thieves!,This is nonsense. The studio is trying to double-dip consumers again by releasing the theatrical versions well ahead of the extended versions even though the extended versions have been released years ago.BD technology would easily allow both extended and theatrical in one set. Why not offer both at once? Money.Resist the urge to buy this and wait for a combo set. This is insulting to consumers.
1,Give the People What They Want!,"Come on New Line, you've already gotten our money twice with the regular and extended edition DVDs. You know no one wants the regular version on Blu-Ray, but you're going to release it by itself so you can make even more money when you release the extended edition. I for one, will not buy the same trilogy four times, regardless of how good it is. Stop trying to screw your customers and GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT: the extended edition of this awesome trilogy in glorious Blu-Ray HD!"
1,"Seriously, no extended version","I am all for people making money, but this is ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason to release these movies on BluRay without the extended versions. As with all things in life, I believe in suffering the consequences of mistakes. In this case, let them lose money for a terrible decision! Do not reward them by buying this product!"
1,I already own LotR...,What a rip off! I already own LotR on DVD as well any millions of other fans... This is pure greed!
1,Not willling to get robbed,"New Line could easily put both, the teather and the extended edition, in a single presentation,I'm not willing to buy this edition, and then buy the extended edition!!Put some pressure on the company, don't buy this set, and make your own 1 star review!"
1,Shame on New Line and Warner Brothers,Don't be a sucker and give into this sham by New Line and their parent company Warner Brothers in their attempt to rip us off on this interim release. Keep up the one star reviews and send a message to WB!
2,Not again!,In this economy? Not a chance. I await the extended release hoping I still have job in 2011.
1,"Dont buy, teach lesson","Don't buy. encourage others not to. let sales collapse. buy the ""five star extended."" B@stards"
1,I'll Wait,I too was excited about going out and purchasing the LOTR box set on Blu as soon as it hit the streets. Like everyone else I have both versions on DVD and don't need two more. I hope that the studios will take notice of this movement and learn their lesson for future releases. Give the customer what they want and not what you want to give them!!! It's also up to the consumer not to mindlessly buy everything that is fed to them.
1,What a waste!,"Although extremely, perhaps painstakingly long, the extended editions are the only ones that provide even close to adequate justice to the original book(s). Major point deductions for 1) Waiting so ******* long to release in HD blu-ray format and 2) for milking all the suckers for their money by releasing this joke first"
1,Yeah thats pretty low.,Blu-Ray is a premium format and there is no excuse for selling a product that is sub par. I will not buy these movies until they are released in their extended format.
1,No extended version?,"Look, these movies are great. Some of the best made. But to release this box set in theatrical version only, well, that sucks! I have been waiting patiently for an unrated or extended version release of these movies. I guess I'll be waiting a while longer. I won't be buying this money-grab boxed set. I recommend you do the same, pass on this one, buy the extended versions, ""whenever"" it's released."
1,Just wait for the extended.,This product is a waste of money for any fan of this film series. You know if you buy this and a couple months later the extended version is released you will buy it as well. Just save your coin for the version you truly want.
1,New Line - please wake up and listen to your fans,"Sorry, this is not a review on the upcoming blu-ray edition - coz, it's not released yet !All I wanted to say is that Uncharted 2 made gamers fall in love with their PS3 all over again. New Line, why can't you do the same by releasing LOTR in EE for your fans ? Make us fall in love with blu-ray all over again."
1,Still Waiting!,I've never seen the theater version of this movie and I don't want to. I will only spend my money on the full 12 hour version in Blu-ray (I already purchased DVD version years ago). I hope it has a sharp looking case like my current set also.
1,Stop this torture...Give us the extended version,"Dear Peter, please stop playing with us. We all LOVE your LotR movies, everything has been said, Oscars have been won, and you and your team deserve every single one of em...(and then some). But giving us this blue-ray version of the trilogy is plain mean and greedy. I spent a s%*@load of $$$ on the DVDs (theater and extended), I even got the video tape after its release of the first movie. I am a fan and I want more, so be kind and be creative. I not only would love to get the blue-ray extended trilogy, I also would love to see you add some fantastic extras, stumble over your creative Easter eggs again, and find everything in a box that you want to keep in a safe, because it looks so beautiful, artful, and simply fantastic."
3,Pretty good,Pretty good movies I like sci fi so I watched all movies and I liked them but not a die hard fan but they were good..
3,"A good alternative, but not as good as the Extended Edition!!","These editions are very nice to have. I own all of the Extended Editions of the films as well, and feel that there is more information on the special features of these dvds than the limited edition dvds. If you are a big fan of the films and of 'making-ofs', I would go with the Extended editions. They are a bit more expensive, but you get more for your money! If you just like the films and would like to know more about how hey are made, but don't have the extra dough, or don't want to dish it out, go with the limited editions. Either way, your in for a treat and get to be a part of cinematic history!"
1,Disgusting.......,"Attempting to squeeze money out of fans and customers by not giving us a proper Theatrical and Extended version of the film. Why? Economy is as bad as it can ever be, everyone knows that, and yet they still try to make us look like fools so please. No one buy this."
1,New Line = Grima Wormtongue,"New Line, performing a spot on portrayal of Grima Wormtounge from LOTR, tries to convince consumers they are releasing what we've all been waiting for.Sorry Grima, your silver tounge has no power over us. We can see rigtht thru you, and we're not buying it. We'll wait for the EE.Go ahead and recycle truckloads of theatrical releases sitting in your warehouse. You'll need the raw material to produce the all the EE units you'll sell when you finally decide to do right by consumers. Holy Necromancer, there's no telling how many of these TR BluRay's you a-holes made. You won't sell 1/3 of them.Have you ever heard of market research? So freaking arrogant. Market research would have told you to at a MINIMUM launch BOTH versions. Douchebags."
1,"We waited forever for Blu-Ray and you do this to us...shame, shame",What else is there to say. This is crappy. Do the right thing and get the extended version out quickly.
1,they want you to buy this twice,"they should release the extended editions at the same time, not 10 months from now. they want people who cant wait to pay twice. horrible product"
1,Let's put this one in a landfill!,Let's put this one in a landfill! Have it join the Atari 2600 E.T. game as one of the worst marketing decisions ever. This is just unsat.
1,Really???,"Short and simple... Save your money and wait for the full director's editions to come out. We have waited this long for the Blu-ray of the LOTR set, and we can wait for New Line (Warner) to do this right."
1,Forget about the theatrical/extended thing - THESE TRANSFERS SUCK!,"Seriously, all this hate over the extended/non-extended, at least they are up front about that and tell you on the package.What really stinks are these AWFUL transfers. These films look really bad in HD. The CGI work looks really poor in this much detail.Check any review on any Blu-ray website - they all agree, transfers are very poor. Better than DVD? Yup, but not worth nearly this much money especially when you factor in the extended version debate."
3,"""Beware of these editions!""","I just purchased ""TROTK"" at a local Tower Records, and I was lead to believe that the theatrical edition was on the A side, and the extended edition was on the B side. How pointless is this reissue?I bought it so I could watch the extended edition without having to insert the second disc, I did'nt mind that the audio commentaries have been omitted and the DTS-ES audio is not there, but come on now. This is just another attempt to get more money out of you. Don't get me wrong the documentary is very good, but I believe that New Line Cinema could've waited to add this to the HD-DVD release. So BEWARE of these editions, and save your money."
1,Stop abuse,"I'll be short: Stop abuse!!! Every single movie should make full use of the blu-ray format, therefore all the previously version of a movie should be available in a single disk. I'm happy so far 3,156 customers think the same! (+1 and counting)."
1,"lame, lame, lame!!!",Where is the extended version??? It is so lame. Nobody should buy this one until extended version is out in blu-ray format.
1,Thanks for the warning - NOT the extended versions = pointless.,"So stupid and pointless to release anything other than the extended versions on Blu-ray. Obviously everyone who likes the movies owns them already on DVD. Hardcore fans like myself can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray, but are also obviously going to want the Extended versions on Blu-ray, not the theatrical releases. And for crying out loud, it's blu-ray - you could put both versions on a single disc if you wanted to. But as always the studios are trying to squeeze every single dime out of us - the reason why no one blinks an eye at illegally downloading stuff. It's hard to get screwed by the studios on stuff like this then take them seriously when they cry about losing money to downloading!Anyway - I wouldn't waste my money on this version - wait for the extended versions on Blu-ray!"
1,Almost purchased until I asked what version,"I ALMOST walked out of a Best Buy with the special edition copy of this that included a little sword replica letter opener. Then I looked on the packaging to make sure it was the Extended Editions that I already own on DVD. The packaging did not say either way, even in the fine print. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE THEATRICAL TO BE RELEASED AGAIN!! I asked a store rep and they say it was theatrical. I promptly put it back on the shelf.This is such a ripoff and insult to LOTR fans to attempt to dupe us again!! I bet they will do the same for the Hobbit!"
1,Bad picture transfer!,"First of all, I think they should've put out the extended editions as well, that aside though the picture transfer for the blu-rays are horrible. The first film suffers the worst, with the second film being a big improvement and the third film is definately the best. Skip these for now and hopefully when they out out the extended editions they will be better transfers."
1,No thanks. We don't want to play the George Lucas game.,Give us the extended versions as well. They have them mastered and ready to go. Don't buy this set and feed the studio's ego.
1,Studios won't get it until we stop re-buying,Boo to New Line. Releasing just the theatrical versions on blu ray is like spitting directly in the faces of your fans. Fans that are rabid for this stuff and have given you millions of dollars. At least this lets me keep an eye out to avoid buying any other New Line releases.
1,No Extended? No buy!,I have the original theatrical releases on DVD as well as the extended versions. I would love to see them in Hi-def but not going to shell out $60 just to be screwed into buying the extended versions........AGAIN. I am very content to wait. :D
1,Wait for Extended Editions,"Dear New Line,Please release LOTR extended editions in Blu Ray.Will buy those. Not these shameful ploy of a product.Thanks!"
1,Extended or nothing,"I don't going to buy the Theatrical versions, forget it! You must release the extended versions."
1,I'll buy the extended when it comes out.,"Like most others, I'm saving my money for the extended version which should have come out this time around. They could have easily added the theatrical version with the extended cut. Instead, they wanted to screw customers over again. My family purchased the theatrical version years back, days later the extended version came out."
5,Lord of the Rings - Trilogy / Extended Edition,"Fantastic, glad I didn't buy all three as soon as they came out and waited until the prices came down!"
1,Won't be buying this,"LOVED the movies. Do not like the fact that this Blu Ray release will be the theatrical versions only.I'll wait for the extended versions, thanks."
1,"Do we look stupid, where's the extended versions","Don't give the rip off artists your money, the only way we can put an end to this is to stop buying. Time and time again we fall for this. NO MORE!!!!!"
1,New Line is a bunch of greedy jerks,"Dear New Line,I'm still NOT buying the theatrical edition. It's 2011 - release the extended blue ray edition already."
1,Waiting for extended release,"First of all this is my favorite movie trilogy of all time. However, I am very disappointed that this is FINALLY released on blu-ray only to have the EXTENDED versions left out! How infuriating. I will pass up this copy and watch the extended version DVD's. IF the EXTENDED version are released on blu-ray, I will be one of the first in line."
1,THE RETURN OF THE......RIPOFF!!!!!,"This is pretty brazen for New Line to try to rip off the fans like this. Maybe they thought nobody would notice? I'm sure they'll sell some copies, especially to the Walmart crowds. But what good does it do them if their core fan base is pissed off?"
1,"Just say NO to the practice studios ""Double Dipping""","I think it's incredibly rude to even bother marketing the theatrical releases as they are very incomplete and don't offer the viewer the actual experience in it's entirety. This is a horrible practice and if no one buys the initial release, it will send a clear message."
1,We've learned from the past...,"George Lucas (Star Wars Saga) did it, Zach Snyder (Watchmen) did it, don't let New Line do it! They're just trying to take all of our money from this release and then throw us the extended versions later in the year (probably loaded with even more features just to make you buy it). I won't fall for it and neither should you. Yes all three films deserve 5 stars, but we are rating the product here, not the films. Please don't let them trick you, do NOT buy these films on blu-ray until the extended editions are released. You'll be happy you kept your $65.99 (or even happier if you kept your $100 retail in a store!!)."
1,stop the madness,Why would you put out a blu ray movie that doesn't have the extended cut....even b-rated movies do that. We all know its about the money right?????
1,Have to agree on the screwage...,It's sad there is no inclusion of ALL versions in this release... just not right... I'll be waiting with the rest of the masses on the One True Product...
1,IT'S GOOD VERSUS EVIL ALL OVER AGAIN,"Great movies poor marketing. Warner/New Line, with 1600 1 star reviews you should take example with titles like Blade Runner and Star Trek the Original Series. You'd find a far stronger following if you just do it right the first time instead of screwing the very people that feed you.""We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!""To add I will be skipping this whole release and rewatching my trusty extended versions on DVD. I already put them on and they look pretty darned good."
1,RUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this item because it said it was stainless steel. Well I have rust everywhere on them I cannot put them in the dishwasher or let them sit in the sink to long. Can I return these? I am very unsatisfied. Can you e-mail an address so I can send photos of these awful knives.signed a very disappointed customer
4,"when battery's dead, always better than nothing","i have 3 original batteries from canon and two 3rd party one's.i always try to use the originals when possible, but when batteries are down, the spares are always a handy addition to your line-up.I dont compare them in terms of how many shoots but the build quality is about the same, the originals are more precise in fit, but, so far, everything is fine.I put it on, powers up the camera, shoot a couple hundred shoot, done."
5,"this CD sucks,umm I don't thinkkk so",O.K. all of you f*cks dissin need to shutup cause this cd is off the hook. maybe this cd would suck if esham wasn't rappin about what he raps about atleast at this point in his career. Esham is amazin so quit hatin bizitch!!! p.s. NIA on the way
3,"Repetitive and stale, but experimental.","Personally, I hate this album. It has some descent instrumentals, but the lyrics sound recycled. Although one of the good songs, the beat for Au Revoir sounds kind of like the song Kill or be Killed off of Dead Flowerz. I'm still a fan, but not of this album. You could take a few songs from this, Repentance and Suspended Animation and make an alright mix. So as a whole I give the album 2 stars.Good songs1.""We Cumin' for U""2.""Slow Motion""3.""Outcha Atmosphere""4.Night Vision5.Au Revoir + a couple others. But 7 or 8 out of 22 songs. Not worth the price."
4,So What if it's Not Tolstoy!,"Look, when one picks up a book by Benchley and other popular authors of contemporary fiction, one knows that the pages contained within will be entertaining, possess highly implausible situations, contain semi-developed characters who take a backseat the action unfolding, and overflowing with melodramatic excess.What else do you want for a hot summer afternoon?""White Shark"" delivers!"
2,Successful failure,Peter Benchley's new book is what I would call a successful failure. In the beginning of the book the setting is unclear and the events not thoroughly given out which gives it a scary atmosphere. Good starting. We don't know exactly what is going on in the book yet. From the point in the book that suggests the creature has legs and arms is when the book takes its major downfall. The book was very well written except for the fact that a shark with steel teeth and legs is TOO far fetched. Turns the novel into something similar to a comic book. It took a major downfall with this. However it did get me going for a minute. It was very creepy right through the point before the end. After that it was a joke.
1,"Mini, NOT micro - NOT for Razr VE20","The seller supplied pictures were not sufficient initially to allow you to realize that this is a mini usb like a camera uses, NOT a micro usb like many newer phones use.WILL NOT FIT Motorola RAZR VE20 !!!!The co. did not make this clear in the listing originally. Now I am stuck because it costs more to mail this thing back to Minnesota than the credit that will be issued.I AM VERY FRUSTRATED W/ SF Planet !!!"
5,Works just as expected,"I bought this charger to work with my Motorola RAZR V3m, and it does so perfectly. It's small enough to fit into the compartment on top of my center console, and the cord is long enough to use the phone while it is plugged in, though you have to keep pulling since it tries to recoil. It doesn't have the extra plug on the back to give power to another device (i.e.- plug your iPod into it so they both have power) but I was nervoud to buy one of those products since they were off-brand. This one works exactly as expected."
2,Not really OEM,"I read the reviews of the other products and decided to buy this one because of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) description despite the high $6 S&H fee, but I was duped. When you plug in this charger the phone reads ""Unauthorized Charger"" so it's clearly not OEM. It does appear to charge the phone, very slowly. After an hour of driving charging a fully dead battery it only registered two bars on my Razor."
3,"Works as Advertised, but OEM???","I am a bit suspicious about whether this is a true OEM charger. The component quality, especially the connector which goes to the phone, does not seem to match up with my wall charger (genuine MOT) which came with my RAZR. The connector does not protrude as far out of the rubber block as my wall charger. This made it impossible to charge my phone with the case on (the connector would pop out or not make a good connection). I eventually had to trim back the rubber to accomodate the thickness of the phone case, which solved my problem. Overall, it does seem to work fine and I plan on keeping it. It will only get intermitent use, and I am hoping it will last for a while. It is what I expected at this price point..."
5,"Works well, does the job, reliable","Easy to use, if you have a Motorola phone, this should be standard equipment. I'd buy another if I needed to"
5,A little problem resolved wonderfully!,"The Motorola cell phone charger I ordered was such a generic description that it's no surprise that the company sent the wrong one. But when I called it to their attention, they responded quickly and swapped it for the right one. I would buy from them again."
2,DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON!!,"I ordered the item pictured above directly from amazon, but they substituted a motorola car charger that looks like it has a magnifing glass on the end. My phone is a Tundra, and the accessory states it's for the V3razor...hope it works. 1st time Amazon has substituted a different item. BEWARE if you want the item above!"
4,"Works, but short cord","This product effectively charges my phone, which is all you really need from a charger. However I gave it only 4 stars because the cord is too short to comfortably hold it to my ear while charging in the car (which is a small coupe). Also, it did not come in Motorola retail packaging as promised, though that's not a surprise given the price."
4,Good charger overall,"It appears that all bad reviews here were caused by the BargainCell service, and not by the product itself. I bought it from Amazon directly, and it was at my door in 2 days shipped free. Good quality and nice looking charger from Motorola, which works the way it should. The reason I give it only 4 stars is that the blue Moto light is a little too bright for me - at night it's the brightest led/light in my car."
4,Motorola Cigarette Lighter Adapter For Motorola RAZR V3...Very Good,"A very useful product, it has quality and functionality.For me it is very good product."
5,Cigarette Lighter Adapter for Motorola Razr,The price for the cigarette lighter adapter was great and it works even better. It recharges my very quickly. Great item!
1,NOT LIKE PHOTO OR DESCRIPTION!!,"Right in the title they label this as ""Motorola Retail Packaging"" however that is not true. It comes in a plastic bag and is not even a Motorola product. It doesn't even look like the photo! The blue part that should light up is black and only has a small blue light bulb poking out of the plastic. It looks cheap and will probably fall apart shortly. I am sort of scared to plug my phone into it for fear of a power surge or something that would ruin my phone. I ordered directly from Amazon thinking it must be the other sellers that are selling this knock-off garbage but I was wrong. I wish the reviews would tell you specifically who the person bought theirs from since they might be selling different products. If you read the reviews and see a good one that says theirs is genuine make sure to check the date. Some of them are from 2006. It seems now most people just getting the crappy, cheap junk that I got. I will post a pic of what I received shortly."
1,not ALL Motorola Phones,"Until you get REALLY Far into the product description do you find that this is for the RAZR phone. I bought a Motorola Q Phone from Amazon and this charger came up as an appropriate add on...so I got it...and it doesn't fit. SO, I'll return it. It came really quickly! Got it before I got the phone. I'll see how they do on returns."
4,Works!!!!,The charger works fine. I would have given 5 stars but the battery get very hot during the charge cycle. I dont give a full charge with this. I only charge it for a short time and only if I must have the phone ready for a call.P.S. My phone is a V3 raz
4,Great Deal,This product works great but is slightly cumbersome. It does have a nice clip to minimize the cord in tight situations.
4,such a great live band,I feel bad for any SOC fans who never saw them live. Their recordings suffer greatly by comparison.
5,I learned so much!,"This is a wonderful book on prayer. I learned over 40 ways to pray to God including the Wesley Covenant Prayer, Prayer Beads, the Tallith (the Jewish Prayer Shawl) and so many more. I now have a deeper and wider appreciation of the history of the Church. Thank you for this fine book."
4,I liked this book...,"..it is well-written, and has a lot of info packed into it. I learned a few things that will come in handy.I am accustomed to books of this type being poorly written, filled with editorial mistakes, misspellings, etc. There were very few of those distractions in this work.I read the whole thing in about 2 hours; I only wish that it was twice as thick, and filled with twice as many interesting tips and techniques!I am not a professional machinist, but i would bet that if you are, you will find at least a few ideas in here that are easily worth the cost of the book!Would I buy a Volume II filled with similar info-in a heartbeat!"
2,Learned a little but...,"I reently bought this book and got what I expected. Other reviews of this item pretty much have said it all. I didn't learn much more for the money, even though I used a $10 on my purchase. It might have been menitoned here somewhere but there are contridictions like ""always use a lathe for lathe work and a mill for millwork"" then a little later the author states ""you can use a lathe for mill work and a mill for lathe work."" I might not have quoted verbatem but you can get the picture. I felt Home Machinists Handbook by Doug Briney was much more informative, even though it's targeting the Sherwood mini lathe and it's $20 less. Briney also gave a few good reference charts. If you're a novice stick to Home Machinists Handbook."
3,its cool but after a few months of it playin' it will die,its tooo main streem its gonna die in a few month
3,Knife comes up a little short,"I love global knives. LOVE THEM. So I was excited the moment I saw this ""tomato knife"" and ordered it STAT. It's solid and cuts well, but for most tomatoes the blade is not long enough...if you use it for smaller items it works great but if you want to cut anything beyond a medium-sized tomato, I'd recommend the 6-inch Global serrated knife. So my review is not about quality, it's about utility. And when it comes to utility, this knife comes up a little short."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a single purpose hatchet, and that's a drawback. It's only made for chopping, at which it's excellent. However, I needed a hatchet which could chop as well as hammer. If you want to be able to hammer with this hatchet, you'll have to grind the ""ridge"" off the back of the head. I'm not sure why Fiskars designs them this way. The large grip contour at the base of the handle also makes for awkward hammering, but it's still doable. Lightweight and fairly durable, although I hit a small aluminum nail with it to knock a sign off a tree last week and it left a ding in the cutting edge which I thought shouldn't happen. It's far from perfect but is a good hatchet."
2,Mickey Mouse axe,"This axe, while it may be the darling of those who insist that all objects be small and lightweight, is completely useless. It's too small. It wasn't that sharp out of the package. And, it would barely chop a 1/2"" branch. That makes it useless. Better to get a real hatchet, 14""-17"" long, with which you can split wood by swinging it. The positive reviews about this product were totally misleading, the whole point of an axe is the momentum you gather as you swing it. Otherwise, it has to be knife sharp, which it was not. It's also not heavy enough. If I wanted it for backpacking I'd still get the hatchet size and hang it from the backpack. I'm not an axe expert, but neither are the reviewers who rave about this tool, and I don't think it takes a certain skill either. It's just the wrong size for anything you'd want to use an axe for."
3,"OK, But Has a Formatting Problem","I like reading about Remo and Chiun, but this Kindle book has a formatting problem. It seems all the quotation marks have disappeared, so it's difficult to tell when someone is ""talking."" Just a heads up for anyone who might find this distracting. Hopefully Amazon or someone will correct this."
4,Pleased,Bought this shaver as a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it!I would recommend it to anyone.
2,I would expect this from FisherPrice,"My previous shaver, the Braun 6520, worked a alot better than this toy.With this Shaver:The ""automatic lock"" doesn't work. It tends to ""unlock"" all of a sudden on you.The shave is ""o.k""The Plastic cover is always taking off the entire shaver head.The travel case is flimsyUnless you clean you shaver everyday, expect it to be a dirty shave the next time.Very disappointed."
5,Favorite for dinosaur lovers,My son and I got this from our local library and he loved it so much I bought it for Christmas. It's got a lot of different dinosaurs and nice illustrations. He's 3 and currently in his dinosaur phase. It's perfect for a kid like him!
5,Wonderful book for Dinosaur and Dachshund lovers alike,"I bought this book back in 2003 (9 years ago) when I started collecting children's books featuring dachshunds - my favorite dog. Little did I know that five years later I would have a son who loves not only dachshunds (our family has three of them) and dinosaurs. My little boy is now almost four years old and can't get enough of this book. The brave dachshund in the story, Shadow, is the main character, and my son loves reading this story with me and interjecting his own thoughts of what Shadow must be thinking or feeling during the entire dinosaur encounter. It looks like Shadow of the Dinosaurs may be out of print since Amazon no longer fulfills new book orders at the time I'm writing this, but if you (or your child) love animals and dinosaurs, you will absolutely want to purchase a copy of this wonderful book!"
2,stiffffffffffff!!!,"This is a very stiff fly rod and that make it difficult to cast with , it is like casting with a 2x4, I thought it would have been a better rod because there fly reels are very well made and work great, this rod does have a lifetime warranty but getting use to casting with this rod will take alot of practise, I purchased a TFO and a Martin in the same weight 7, and they both cast much better than this rod and are 150% easier to use, so if you are looking for a good fly rod this not it unless you like casting your 2x4 all day long!!enjoyRick"
4,Does the job!!!,"It appears that the first guy to review this humidifier didn't bother to read the directions. He said there is no way to tell if the unit needs to be refilled. That is completely incorrect. The digital readout will indicate the level of humidity in the air but if one of the bottles is empty an ""F"" displays on the left or right to tell you that the bottle on that side needs to be filled. This unit definitely does the job but it is quite flimsy and it is very noisy. I find it hard to justify the $180 price based on build quality but it does do the job."
4,Very Pleased with Humidifer,I have another of the same model upstairs and decided to get one for the downstairs living area. I am pleased with both and the price through Amazon was lower than the local store that handles it. Went with Amazon and really am pleased with the transaction and turn around time. I like this model because of the filter which is easy to change. No belts which made me crazy trying to clean. I would recommend this model for anybody looking to purchase a whole house humidifier.
3,A So-So Scoobie Tale,"While the author generally has a good hold of the voices of the characters, and some of the dialogue made me smile, this novel is not one of the best. The problem comes in the plot. It's quite dull. The developement is mostly logical, but threat is not always intriguing. The plot made me want to give up on the book, but the dialogue made me want to continue reading. I expect this author could do much better with a different topic."
2,"Not the best, I fear.","I have to agree with those who were disappointed with this book - though I see no need to be rude about it. For me the single greatest problem was its wordiness. (""...smoothed the edges of vigilant readiness...?"") Writing that calls attention to itself like this is counterproductive in an action-oriented book like Buffy. Adjectives are wonderful. Too many adjectives just drag."
4,"This is such a good book, but there is only one problem...","I woke up one morning and had absolutely nothing to do. I went to the library, and picked a book randomly off of the shelf. It was an awesome random choice! This book combines all of the emotions, love, hate, pain, excitement, and distress. I haven't read the first one in the series, and I still got sucked into it on the first page. The only this that I didn't like about this book is that it leaves you hanging. You never know what happens until you read the next one in the series. I think that this is just a way that the publishers get us to pay them money for buying the next book to find out what happened."
4,what in awesome book,this book is a really good book but there is way to many characters. this book is really intersting but this is not for boys.if u like action and all other emotions this is the book for you!!!
2,More of the same,"This book has nice quilts pictured, but many are repeated or similar to those in Kitty's book ""Quilting with Japanese Fabrics"". There are several added appliqued quilts. It's a great stand-alone book, but if you already have the above mentioned book you might not need this one."
3,global parig knife,"Top quality steel,right length & heft.The problem is with the handle wich is way too slender. When working with wet hands is downright dangerous.Practically you have to hold the knife with your fingertips(& I have small hands),even so the handle corrugation is not suffficient to give a firm hold."
1,les miserable.,did not match my expectations : I wanted the book on tape. The singing is not my cup of tea. Neither the opulent dramatic version.
3,Not sure what to think,"Having heard good things about the Harlequin Flipside series, I decided to give them a try. So far, I haven't found one that has been good. Not that I'm expecting to read classic literature, but I do enjoy mindless reading at times. May be I just haven't found the right book in the series to read. Do-Over sounded good, but halfway through I started to think the author should take her character's advice and ""do-over"" this book. I'll guess I'll keep reading until I can find one in the series that is good."
3,Story - no music,Disappointed that it is not music to sing along with. It is a narrative sounding like it came out of a script to speak to unbelievers. Not what I expected.
4,All Digital all the time,"I won't go into the story of the film, others have done a fine job on that.Comments on the DVD: received it from iNetVideo via Amazon. It took almost two weeks to arrive as it was shipped from Canada and most likely got stuck in Customs. DVD arrived in excellent condition.The film is in French, subtitles available in the film, but not on the extra material, which is unfortunate as my French is attrocious.Now for the ""All Digital"" part. I bought this mostly to see what all digital feels like. If you do it for that reason, be prepared to spend the first third of the film asking yourself: ""All righty then, was that a set or was that an effect?"" At first I was disappointed, as the film looked as though it was shot on video tape not on film. As time went on, I got used to the new format and some of the scenes were magnificent. The story line was good as well, so overall, I recommend it for film buffs and casual movie watchers."
4,water pump,Pump appears to work good although it did not fix my problem which I have yet to resolve.Checked it using a jug of water and it worked great.
4,SHURflo,Works great!! It is nice to have water in my camper again. Pump came quick and was ez to install.
1,TOTAL JUNK,I got 2 of these and within a year both locked up. Other customers seem to like theirs. Went to a FLOJET 03526-144 and it's been running strong for over 4 years now. Never buy another one made by Shurflo again.
5,Engrossing novel,"Sinclair Lewis poured his wrath against bigotry into Kingsblood Royal. Even near the end of his career, his writing had power and precision. Years of research illuminated his views, and a talent for scorching satire served him well. Some have argued that Neil Kingsblood would not have made the choice to go public with the discovery of his ancestry, that the story was for that reason not realistic. I disagree. The reasons for his choce develop step by step, conversation by conversation, reaction by reaction, logically and necessarily. I found the novel to be as engrossing as Lewis's widely recognized classics of earlier decades (Babbit, Elmer Gantry, Main Street)."
4,Great story line and descriptive words.,This book is a great book if you are into old books and the story line is great and makes me want to keep reading.
4,Travel rod and reel a good buy,I recently purchased a Okuma rod and reel travel pack. I used it a couple of times to make sure it worked ok before my trip. It is a very nice combo that casts easily and has a light enough action that I enjoyed using it to catch small panfish. The whole pack is a bit bulky but worth the space to make sure your rod and reel get to your destination in good shape.
1,it sucks,"The first time I used it, it broke the last piece in the middle, I could not catch anything and to spread it's a very annoying process, not recommend it at all"
4,Good Value vs. Price,"I purchased this travel kit to keep in the back of my SUV so that I am never without a pole and some rudimentary tackle. I've used it a couple of times. I don't really have any issues with the kit. The reel is not quite as smooth as some other spinning reels I have that are somewhere around the same price. Overall, I like this product and I am glad I own it."
4,Mostlyly pleased with this unit.,"I bought this unit to replace a unit I've had for over 20 years and it is a very usuable unit. My only complaint is the bail is sometimes a little sticky when you flip it after a cast, but this seems to be getting better with use. The case is great and plenty of space for lures and tackle."
2,reels are cheap,"The rod is OK but the reels are cheap. You get what you pay for. Not the best quality as mostly the case with ""Made in China"". May last a couple of seasons. Reels have a lot of plastic, not sure how much wear and ear it will take."
2,lcontains lead chemical!!!,"I bought this fishing pole for my son,butWarning Sticker read""This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm etc""So,I return the product to amazon....I would not recomend product contain Lead Paint on fishing rod..."
4,Anointed,"I really enjoyed this album it has its own flavor even though Sara and Kim came out around the same time I feal that Sara reaches a diffrent audience. She has more of a hip hop feal, wich everyone can't get it to, but I know God will bless."
1,"Didn't realize it when I ordered it, but this item is used. And it doesn't work.","I bought a new remote because I needed a ""new"" remote. This thing is used, and broken. If you're looking for a new remote, shop somewhere else."
5,Works better than expected,Awesome remote! Exactly the one I need to replace our old one that suddenly decided to not change the channel whenever it felt like it. It is even better than our old one because now the off button turns off both the TV and the directv. Thank you!!! A++++ product.
4,Classic Fairy Tales Rewritten,"This is the fourth anthology of Datlow and Windling's that I have read. If you've read any of the fairy tale anthologies and liked them, then you shouldn't be disappointed with this one. ""Stronger Than Time"" tells the story of ""Sleeping Beauty"" from an original perspective. ""Godson"" is a story about a young man whose ""god""-father is Satan. ""Sweet Bruising Skin"" is an interesting and disturbing take on ""The Princess and the Pea."" With stories by Peter Straub, Roger Zelazny, Patricia C. Wrede and more, this is an anthology that's definitely worth the read."
5,"""And away we go!""","Thirty years of Destroyers rock 'n' roll is featured on one of the best live discs George has released (behind ""Let's Work Together"").The track listing is routine stuff by now but the production is excellent and the performance is tight. Much better than ""Live in '99"".If you're a Destroyers fan this is the live CD you'll be playing, if you're new to Thorogood this is a great introduction and a document of one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands in history."
3,Victor Mature is excellent!,"""The Savage Wilderness"" tries very hard to achieve a realistic atmosphere but misses the mark under the weight of its Hollywood contrivances. Still, the movie is a very notable attempt at an adult treatment of the genre, and the plot and presentation are intense enough to hook the viewer from the start. Robert Preston plays the most interesting character, a commanding officer determined to go into battle at any cost to his personnel or his marriage, but Victor Mature gives the best performance as a standard semi-savage/semi-civilized trapper-hero. Guy Madison plays the commanding officer who must defer to Preston, and another ""Guy""--Guy Williams of ""Zorro"" and ""Lost In Space""--has a minor role as Madison's underling. Handsomely produced and laced with well-directed action scenes."
2,Not that great......from a great author,"I went to Half Priced Books one day, while rummaging around I came across this book ""The Totem"" it was praised for being one of the best horror novels ever written!, Imagine my excitement!!!. The Totem starts off pretty good(comes across as a supernatural thriller) but as you reach the middle of the story, it becomes a medical disaster story and not a very good one at that. David Morrell is a terrific writer, this must be one of his first novels. (I wonder if while writing The Totem someone said while halfway through that if he writes a horror story he'll be pigeonholed and won't be able to write anything else and so decided to change it), Oh well... who cares just skip it."
2,May not be the worst book I ever read,"Hmmm . . . How can a complete unaltered version of a book originally published in 1979 contain references to events occurring in 1993? The only thing that made me believe that this book could have been originally written in 1979 or earlier was lack of use by the author of cut-n-paste technology, resulting in character development scattered in the strangest and most inappropriate places. I agree that it wasn't altered - and should have been. Why give it two stars? Because I saved one star in case I come across a book worse than this one."
4,Great mix of action and horror,"I have been a great fan of David Morrell for many years. The first two novels I read were The Fifth Profession and Brotherhood of the Rose. Obviously I enjoy his action works. I have never read horror novels before this so this book intrigued me. I found it excellent. Morrell combines his classic high adventure style with incredibly descriptive knowledge of the fear that can be produced by dark and lonely wilderness areas. As a hunter and outdoorsman, I know that tight feeling in your throat when camped in a strange forest and you hear movement and see shadows but just are not sure what made them. I found this novel very exciting. Just do not read it at night while camping."
1,Got stuck up a tree on this deal.,When I purchased this item I was under the clear impression that I was purchasing the entire kit which includes a book and deck of cards. Well when the book arrived by itself I was none to happy. So I have filed a complaint against this company via Amazon and as far as I know I have not had my money for the purchase reimbursed. So the company that ripped me off on this deal called Daily Deal will never see another purchase from me ever again. And I would strongly discourage others from dealing with them.
4,Fascinating,"This deck follows the BLFSN sequence. I recommend The Book of Ogham by Edred Thorrsen, and/ or Green Witchcraft II by Ann Moura for additional casting, layout and interpretation.Other Ogham oracles use BLNFS, and product description and reviewers don't always include that information."
2,Nick,This product is not the original compaq battery it is a cheap copy and does not perform to the same standard as the original. The battery does not calibrate properly and lasts about 1 hour. All in all you should save your money and find a genuine compaq battery on ebay.
3,Good but not grat,"I bought this watch for my dad and it looked great in the photos, however after receiving it I was kind of dissapoined with the quality of the band and face of the watch. It kind of feels cheap and kind of flimsy. Not what I expected from a Swiss made watch. Buyer beware!"
2,Flimsy,"Does not sharpen particularly well. Furthermore, the cheap, flimsy plastic cover constantly comes off when you drag the knife through.Definitely not recommended."
3,Yoshikin makes two similar sharpeners...,"I'm posting this as a comment, not as a review. Yoshikin makes two sharpeners that look almost identical, model numbers GS-220 and GS-440. The model where the plastic covering of the ceramic wheels extends to the sharpener's handle is the GS-440. The model I posted this comment for is the GS-220. The 440 goes for ~$50 whereas the 220 goes for ~$35. To be honest, I don't know how the two differ technically. Yoshikin claims the 440 is a heavy duty version of the 220 and is designed to work on German knives as well as Global knives (the 220 is only recommended for Global knives)."
1,"Not worth it - messed up MY knife, too","Maybe it's just me... But I have NEVER had any luck with knife sharpeners. Therefore, I always let my husband (yeah, I know - stereotype!) do the work, since he has the skill. So, he attempted to sharpen up my older Global blade - and it got worse. He was very disappointed in it, too.Sorry to say it, and I'm happy others have found it helpful, but for me, it didn't work at all. *sigh* I s'pose I'll have to re-package it and send it in for a return."
3,Classy Chef,"Well, I purchased this product at the same time I ordered the Global knife since it seemed to be recommended. It's just ok. Nothing to rave about. In fact, I like my little fish-shaped one I got from Home Depot for just $10 much better."
4,Classic courtroom drama,"This material was mostly consistent with all earlier Perry Mason seasons, but it lacked the freshness one might expect from such a long running and well done series. I enjoyed it and laughed at the predictable outcomes but it was worth it. The first seasons were better though."
5,"Perry Mason: The Seventh Season, Vol. 1",We watch Perry every Saturday night eating pizza and enjoy the series. We started with the first show and continued through this one.
5,A Real Treat,"In view of present-day courtroom drama and crime shows, Perry Mason remains at the top of this genre. The episodes are well-written with professional acting and beautiful set designs. The quality of the DVDs is excellent. I will buy Season Seven, Volume 2, today. So much better than the trash presented on prime time tv...I'll stay with Perry because he doesn't disappoint or offend this viewer."
4,History of Japanese Bikes,Book was in very good condition. Much less expensive than other sites that were advertizing it that I found on the net. Would recommend Amazon for quality/price anyday.
2,Maybe I just had a bad pack but...,it flaked on me. I would go out for 2 hours and come back with dark circles under my eyes. I looked like a raccoon! It could have been because it wasn't the waterproof formula. I wanted to love it so badly. It looked and felt sooo natural!... but those flakes... :(
2,Review on Mermaids Fantasy,This movie had nothing to do with Mermaids. There wasn't a single one. This movie is just a lousy porn knockoff.
2,"Great idea, poor results","I have to agree with Ian and the other reviewers who were, like me, disappointed in this book. The authors talk past each other, neither taking up the other's challenges. Hirsch does not seem up to the task, in terms of writing or scholarship, and ultimately Reinman wipes the floor with him. (There must have been someone who could make a more spirited case from the Reform perspective ... ?) The smug putdowns, especially voiced by Reinman in regard to Reform, grew tedious very early, and I finally gave up on page 152 -- and this was during a 9-hour international flight in which I was desperate for something to read! (I would have liked to hang in there to learn how they became friends, as the book jacket and reviews indicate, but I couldn't take it anymore.) For anyone interested in the topic, I would instead recommend ""What Shall I Do with This People?: Jews and the Fractious Politics of Judaism""by Milton Viorst."
5,Amazingly beautiful!,"As so many other reviewers have said, this CD is amazingly beautiful! My preference was initially track four (the heart chakra). However, over time, I have come to appreciate every one of the tracks, each of which mirrors its chakra--from the deeply resonant first track to the ethereal final track. Every time I listen to it, I hear and appreciate something new. I play this CD at home during morning yoga, in my car driving to and from work, and even while having some minor surgery done (it actually soothed the pain and gave me an anchor to focus on). It calms and heals even as it energizes and lifts the spirit."
5,Beneath the Armor of the Athlete,"Lisa's personal battle with the emotional strain and anxiety of athletic competition is clearly depicted in this excellent book. Every athlete will be able to relate to the pre-competition stress, and fear of failure. The book is well written and easily read. Highly recommended for any athlete who has experienced the brain strain associated with competition."
4,Why he wrote the book ...,"I just found a signed copy of this book in my dad's house. Surprised that it was written so long ago. With the passage of the Patriot Act, the author's words seems timeless...""I have written this book because I believe ... that we are moving ever more rapidly in the direction of other liberty-starved nations around the globe. I am concerned that our government like all government throughout history, is winning its long-standing tender offer to it citizens: 'security' in exchange for freedom. The people of this country must come to understand that the 'free lunch' is a myth. The American Dream was not about government's taking huge sum of money (under the label of 'taxation') from citizens by force. The American Dream was about individualism and the opportunity to achieve success without interference from other. It is my sincere hope that this book will motivate you to join with me in helping to restore the American Dream.My hand in yours,Robert J. Ringer"""
1,"Worthless, nonfunctional, out-of-the-box boat anchor",I did something really stupid last night. On an impulse (triggered by the ON SALE sign at the local Target) I bought this worthless unit. I was excited and could not wait to copy a videotape to DVD. No such luck. Hours of wasted time. This thing simply does not work. I tried different DVD+R's and none would format. Even the DVD+RW that was supplied with the unit would not work. I will take this back to Target today for a full refund or replacement with a unit from a different manufacturer.Don't be suckered by the RCA brand name. It used to mean quality but not any more.
1,took it back,it wouldn't play my store bought dvds ..They scrambled and stalled. So I returned the unit .Still shopping.
3,Aesthetically pleasing but needed repair,"Although the Bose Acoustic Wave Music System II was aesthetically pleasing when it arrived, the CD player on the top did not work and showed evidence of coffee stains within the CD lid on top. I shipped it off to the Bose factory and had it serviced for an additional fee and it now works like new. I am displeased that I had to have it serviced right away, however, the product acts as a good replacement for a receiver and it's maze of wires."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"For the price, I thought I would rock the house. It is not visually stunning. This product is no louder than my $100 Sirius radio....."
1,Limited use,"Has no external speaker jacks, if you have built in speakers in several rooms, this will not power them so buy another system."
2,More hype than substance,"First, I like to think I take good care of my ears (you should too) and I have good hearing. If you are like blasting your mp3 player, almost any music system may sound good to you. Like all Bose products, its construction and build quality are top notch. It was easy to set up and to use. The sound quality is okay. there are better systems for less money. The future is WIFI radio. You are mainly buying the bose name and all that advertising you see in print and on tv.Also, Bose seems very slow to keep up with basic technological updates. This radio should have HD capabilities."
5,Through the Storm,"I remember when the Lord led me to buy her music , it changed my life and allowed me to see Christ from a different aspect because I was really going through some trials and trbulations. I recommend this CD or Cassette to any and everyone because it gave and showed me strength through scripture. Also, most importantly, I found out that when you allow people to depict what you are feeling and tell you how you should feel, you will never become what God intends for you to do His Will. Please, do be open to correction, but let it not change the way you should be for Jesus Christ."
1,disappointed,i really wanted this product and the seller seems positive i ordered and waited and waited. didnt get it so wrote to the seller. no response. wrote again. no response. contacted amazon then i get immediate response. ended up not having it in stock so they did refund my money back but if they had just communicated that to me i would have been more then willing to wait. poor customer service i feel
4,CeCe Never Stops!,"On her fourth solo project, CeCe does it again. I was very impressed with her other projects but this one impresses me all the more because it is on her own label. My favorite song on the Album is the title song, Alabaster Box. The heartwarming words of this and all of the other songs coupled with CeCe's sweet but powerful voice makes this album a must have for any listener."
5,Great hip-hop,"From when I heard the first notes of ""Killing Spree"", to when the last beats ended in ""Fuel Injected (Remix)"", Bad Dreams is one of the best hip-hop albums out there. If there's anything you want to pick up for your collection, this one is an obvious choice. The album is full of great tracks; my favourites in particular are ""Killing Spree"", ""Take It Back"", ""Bad Dreams"", ""Deep End"", ""Anthrax Island"", ""Ventilate"", ""Burns and Scars"", ""Fuel Injected"", and ""High Road"". As you can see, you can't go wrong with Swollen Members' second album, even with the few ""not-so good"" tracks, like ""Snake Bite"", and ""Fuel Injected (Remix)"". Overall, if you're looking for some sick beats with even better rhymes, pick up ""Bad Dreams"", because the many great tracks more than make up for the two sub-par ones."
1,HORRIBLE AWFUL INK!,This ink is awful!! At first it wouldnt flow then when it did it was thick and gel-like.The colors were separated in the cartridge and it came out as a watered down pinky-orange.I contacted the seller I bought it from-they told me it was my pen and I should clean it out.FYI It was a brand new pen and it now works perfectly with noodlers rattler red.DO NOT BUY THIS INK.
1,arrived broken,"I did not attempt to return the item as I gave it as a gift to a friend last year. She just told me last night that this arrived broken to her and told me she was meaning to let me know. I can't believe I sent a broken item as a gift. The screw that attaches the corkscrew to the top of the rabbit is missing. You can see where it should be because there are threads but there is no screw cap so when you try to use the product it just pops out of the top. I have Amazon Prime and order frequently from Amazon, I don't know if I will continue to do that."
2,Classic for beginners,"The book does as it says: it teaches you to read and date Roman Imperial coins. Features include an explanation of denominations and inscriptions, a table of names on coins relating to names in history books, common reverse figures, mint marks and a list of all emperors with a paragraph on their life and a picture of one of their coins. Two tables on dating and a bibliography round out this book. Not a catalog, not for advanced collectors, fun for anyone else, including non-collectors who have an interest in ancient artifacts."
1,240 pages could have been done in less than 100,"Very disappointing - this is an expensive book so no-one is going to really use the pages to mark as a checklist. In fact when you read through it, there's some guidance about what you should do, but none about how to do it (as previous reviewer noted). The format with some pages landscape and others portrait is also annoying. For the price this is not value at all."
4,Great set for light games,"After using the belts with clips unsuccessfully, we bought & used this one which was already much better just due to the velcro flags. Everything came brand new in the packages all wrapped up individually. You'll have to open each bag (containing a belt & 2 flags) and assemble them (each flag has a sewn ""loop"" that the belt threads through pre-attached). I'd also suggest laying them out under a mattress or books for a day or 2 before use since they will be heavily folded.Only concern would be the small amount of velcro wearing out over time, hence the title saying ""light"" games. Families, kids, etc and you're fine; use in team tournaments or similar, you might need to replace sooner. But that said, the whole set was very reasonably priced for what you get."
4,GREAT MUSIC,"Great music, if you are a big Bowie fan you need this. If your not you just need SOME of this. One warning is there is an annoying DJ on both ends of some songs. I went to the preferences menu on iTunes and set the songs to end sooner or start later to cut the idiot off. But when he is talking over the music you can not really do this. So I knocked off a star for the DJ"
4,Hard to put down!,Great story that never really had any dull spots. Good combination of technical stuff and personal/emotional story. I look forward to the next Bosch story.
4,"Decent effort, a bit predictable","Bosch is at it again, and if you're a Harry fan, you'll like this effort by Connelly. Just the slightest bit predictable. Not bad, but he's had better. (Harry's wife may be the most boring character in fiction. Get rid of her for good!)"
2,Disappointing,"pros:usual Harry Bosch charactercons:opening crime not very interesting.tension between Harry's crew and IAD not very engaging.plot moves ahead sluggishly.I had to give up reading this at p. 170 of 454.As usual, minimal character development. Emphasis is merely on plot. I saw little of Harry's personal life, except for his occasional attempts to call his wife. (But this is true of ALL Michael Connelly books. And I usually put up with it.)"
4,This book is a must read mystery.,Angel's Flight is a book that I could not put down. I started reading it by the recommendation of my mother and sister. The mystery builds its self at a wonderful rate and the suspense that fills the end is almost unbearable. The side conflict with Bosch's wife and his friend being accused of the crime are outstanding extras. This book is truely one that makes you think and I highly recommend it for anyone to read.
5,Angels Flight,I have enjoyed several of Michael Connelly's novels and this was one the best. There were so many surprises that I could not put it down until I finished it. Do you want surprises? This book is for you.
5,Michael Connelly at his best,"In the latest adventures of Harry Bosch, Connelly does not disappoint us. True to form, he proves time and time again that he knows the inner workings and dynamics of a big city police department and the legal system that supports it. This is an ""edge of your seat ride"" that will keep you up all night until you are done. Each time you think you have it figured out, it takes another turn. A must read."
1,Very tiny tiles,"While the color selection of this software may be better, the tiles of the grayscale version are way too small and hard to see. While you can toggle to a larger image of part of the ""stack"" and can pause on a single tile to get it to enlarge, the process takes too long. Admittedly I'm an old geezer (47) who wears glasses, but I don't think anyone could view this game easily."
4,Great wood-handled hammer,"I like wood handles on hammers, and the ""ax handle"" is especially easy to grip. This one is the baby brother of my old framimg hammer, so it has a comfortable feel. The handle is shorter than I'm used to, and the finish was a little rough. In spite of that, I still give this hammer high marks. I own two of them."
3,Michelin Green Guide is still a most useful companion,"Michelin Green Guides were the first guide books to be published about specific regions in France. They still are (for how much time?)useful for people who cannot spend too much time in Bourgogne or Jura. Michelin Green Guide is still valuable. Especially when you visit Burgundy and Jura. Both famous areas for gourmets from all over the world. Because Michelin forged its reputation on restaurants, it is wise to use both Michelin Red Guide 2000 Edition for France and the local green guide for Burgundy and Jura. Those who plan a visit to Switzerland should also buy it. Jura is the other side of the Leman Lake. By the way, some of the most beautiful Alpes and Mont-Blanc landscapes can be viewed from the Jura slopes above Geneva. Because they are concise; because they have explicit propositions Michelin are always to recommend to the one-day or two-days visitor."
2,Weisser just makes stuff up.,"As someone who actually writes for and runs a spaghetti western website, as well as an editor for the massive Spaghetti Western Database, let's just say I watch a lot of spaghetti westerns. Like others, at first, I was blown away at the sheer amount of reviews in Weisser's book. That is, until I actually started seeing some of these movies. Not only does he get cast/crew information wrong, on many films, it's as though he's completely made up a plot. I'll watch a movie, and then check the book the next day, and there'll be a completely different plot than what I saw the night before. What's even more strange is he'll refer to actors that were in the movie, but completely makes up the plot and story line. Weisser is a hack who should have never been published. Unfortunately, it's still the most complete English language guide to spaghettis out there, so it is still useful to an extent."
1,"Confusing, boring, soulless heroine","I agree with a previous reviewer whose gotten to page 50, but reluctantly so. I am reading until I get the next book I've ordered. Thus far, I've found the book hard to keep reading because none of the characters are people that I have any interest in. The repeated references to the ""death of hip hop,"" are a bit much. I liked her other book, More Like Wrestling, which is why I picked up this book. But thus far, Bliss is not holding my attention. Eva, the main character, is insipid. Nothing more to write because I probably won't finish reading this book."
5,A must for every horse owner,"Excellent resources. Can read from front cover to end, or by topic like a reference book. A must for successful partnership with every horse. Productive and effective techniques for dealing with little horse quirks to major behavior issues. A real life saver for horses that others may just give up on. Mr. Roberts breaks down the methods so that anyone can follow and understand. Especially the horses."
3,Unusual,I've tried to start this book about ten times before I got over the hump. This book has an interesting plot along with fascinating charachters but there are many parts where you snooze off and then it becomes rather fast paced again.Also there are a few things in the story that are confusing. Why did the doctor kill Millie's mother? It says she did but I couldn't figure out a reason for why. Also the ending is quite far fetched compared to the rest of the book.
5,Excellent book,"Utah Byways: 65 Backcountry Drives is an excellent book. The trail descriptions are extremely accurate, concise and helpful. I liked the photographs because they give a perspective on a drive. The list of resources, parks and places of interest in the back of the book is invaluable. I wish I had time to go on all the drives. Good job."
3,Holder is just ok,Holder is just ok. The spring is much too tight and is difficult to put the harmonica in it.It's a complete work-out.
3,Not what's pictured,I received a splitter but it's not the one pictured. It looks more like a cheaper one available that did not get good reviews. But not worth the trouble to swap it out. It does work ok so far. Just beware of bait and switch.
1,Complete Mis-representation,"This item is advertised as compatible with the Windows platform, indicating it is computer software. The item shipped is nothing but over-priced card board flash cards. Zero stars would be appropriate."
2,mini harmonica..,The mini harmonica is much smaller than the photos seem to suggest... this device is only one inch long! but works...
4,"One big, powerful audio/visual experience....","When I went out to look for a home theater system I never expected to be bring something like this unit home. It is a bit overwhelming for my home, but I wanted something fantastic to go with the 52 inch Sony Plasma I had recently purchaced also.It has 1000 watts of power-wow-4 tall boy speakers that I can jam in the corners of the apartment. It is a 5.1 channel, one DVD at a time, CD/CD-R/CD-RW, DVD/DVDR/DVDRW. I can also plug my MP3 player into the front of the unit and my Ipod to play music. It also has a JPEG viewer (haven't got to that yet) The subwoofer is small, heavy and blasts the floor until it shakes.It was really simple to put together. Instructions were good (a grade schooler can get to know the functions easy) I have a HDMI input from the receiver to the TV, so the picture is wonderful too.I also like the idea that it is wireless ready.To my liking, I rate it a 4--it was a bit expensive, but I made the choice."
3,Series is Memorable and Product Packaging is Awful!,"It is ashame that I must settle on 3 stars for Seasons 1&2, 3 and 4 of this wonderful series:SERIES RATING is 5 stars (*****)Packaging for Seasons 1-4 is 1 star (*).Packaging for Season 5 is 5 stars (*****)!The manufacturer must have gotten a clue by the 5th season to keep the package straight forward and safe for the disks. The packaging for Seasons 1-4 are bare cardboard covers with glued plastic pages that fall out as soon as the shrink wrap is removed.My solution for the packaging was to use multi-disc covers, cut up the original cardboard cover, insert them into the new covers and VOILA! I have myself the same packaging as Season 5's package.It has been years since I have seen any of the episodes. Even then I was not able to catch all of them in order. What a treat!"
2,"Like the show, BUT . . .","I like the show. But this particular DVD has some problems. First, on some of the disks not all the episodes are listed on the menu. They can only be reached by fast-forwarding through 'play all.' Also, one episode is nearly unwatchable due to flaws in the DVD."
3,Beware!,"While I have always enjoyed Moonlighting and am pleased with the seller's service, it should be noted that at least four of the episodes were missing (two each on Discs 2 and 3--I went no further). I purchased this set twice and had the same problem each time."
2,"interesting info, poorly written","Has a wealth of information on the man behind the myth, but unfortunately the author chose to use far too many similies and metaphors to hammer home certain ideas. Other bios are a better bet. I found myself skimming and skipping through the book as I couldn't stand some of the writing..."
3,Good reading,"Even though this book was not written by Harold Robbins, it is still an enjoyable story. The book is an interesting read but the Publisher needs to hire a proofreader who knows how to spell. If not for numerous typos, I would have given the book a 4 rather than a 3."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I have seen other books by Arthur Grace that I liked a lot better than this one. Many of the pictures are from the 80's, & I was looking for something with earlier pictures. This was just ok"
3,"bowls are OK, pretty","bowl is pretty, smaller and thinner than expected, but, dimensions were printed so fault is not with supplierone arrived broken, so, packing could have been a little more durable due to thinness of bowl tops"
3,Looks nice but not worth the money,"I'm a big fan of magnetic knife racks, but this one is not worth the high price tag. I use mainly global knives for cooking and I thought it would be nice to have a knife rack that matched. It functions fine, but it really isn't any better than a much cheaper one."
4,Great book!,"This book was great! I knew exactly what to study and expect on the exam. In fact I had been planning on taking the exam at twice to get the best score I could but I did so well the first time that I didn't need to take it a second time. Just know that the vocab section is about halfway through the book but you'll want to start studying that first just because it takes longer to absorb vocab. I would recommend turning to their ""Hit Parade"" of vocab words, make flashcards first, and then study them as you go through the rest of the book. Happy studying!"
5,Great GRE preparation.,"This book contains great test preparation materials for the GRE. I would describe this book as straight forward, easy to understand, and thorough. I felt prepared the first time I took the GRE because I studied this book."
5,So far so good!,"I haven't read through the whole book yet, but so far it seems really great. I will taking the GRE after the holidays."
1,HORRIBLE UNSAFE INGREDIENTS,"Buyer beware...It contains petroleum, mineral oil, a very cheap filler, SLS which is toxic to the body, and more bad chemicals including Methylparaben. I hope the professionals buying these products will take time to educate themselves and become more AWARE of these toxic and unsafe ingredients. If you don't believe me go look them up. I am a massage therapist and the last thing I would use is this product!"
1,Awful!,I would not recommend this product to anyone. The description is very misleading and it's the complete opposite of what the manufacture says. When I contacted the manufacture they never responded. This is a terrible product and a waste of money!
5,"Essential, potentially live-saving reading!","Michael Bane's Trail Safe: Averting Threatening Human Behavior In The Outdoors is the first title specifically designed to prepare the outdoorsman and vacationer to defend themselves against criminal behavior in our nation's public parks as well as other rural and wilderness areas. Trail Safe presents the three-pronged self-defense mechanism centered around intuition, awareness, and fear; the nuts and bolts of risk assessment and planning; and a self-defense decision tree that will enable the reader to determine appropriate reactions to a violent encounter, should one occur. Trail Safe is essential, potentially life-saving reading for anyone spending any time in wilderness areas whether hiking, biking, camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, skiing, or any other recreational purpose."
5,fat sick and nearly dead,This movie is very inspiring and a delight to watch. I am twenty kgs over weight and think that following the examples given in this movie could work for me too.
3,Interesting...but relies on anecdotal evidence,"Interesting...but relies on anecdotal evidence. Maybe it's better than what they were doing before, but I need more than a couple stories to convince me this is the best thing to do.This movie seemed like a long juicer commercial."
5,Fabulous insight into nutrition,"This was recommended by my physician for nutrition information only. Though I am not overweight the movie provides insightful and serious implication on the food pyramid and American eating habits. Excellent, motivating, and entertaining way to get the message across."
4,Very good documentary but could have used some better writing,"I really enjoyed this documentary and the amount of weight lost during the juice fast was stunning. It was also impressive watching the changes in the main characters medical conditions.I thought that the video could have been shorter with some tighter editing and better writing, they tried to hard to create suspense without really accomplishing it. The movie was predictable from the start. They writer and producer clearly have an agenda albeit positive and did a good job of keeping a lot of the political nonsense out of the film.If you are considering juicing or if you are considering rebooting your health, I'd strongly recommend watching this from an interesting piece and motivation standpoint. Just don't expect an over the top well written and produced documentary. Watch it for the content not the production value."
4,"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead","The beginning of the movie seemed to move very slowly. I didn't really care for the cartoons. I found them silly and boring. However, as it progressed this movie turned out to be quite an eye opener. I liked it's main message and it's potential to save people's lives (if people follow through with what they need to do in rectifying their eating habits). I plan to recommend this movie for others to also watch and learn from."
5,Convenience Be Damned,"This whole documentary brought joy to my heart.The concept: It is so simple, yet so hard to wrap our heads around... Eating fresh fruits and vegetables is what our bodies crave. It is the true fuel our bodies were made to run on. Deny any running machine fuel and maintenance then see what happens.Weight Watchers helped me trim down my 5'6"" frame from 211 to 150 lbs. (A size 18 to a size 8.) But this program takes it a lot further. This has sparked my interest. The health benefits alone appear to be off the chart. I can see this putting the drug companies out of business and doctors more time on golf course.Fast food and processed boxed foods... not anymore. Convenience be damned."
1,"Hey, wanna buy a juicer?","I certainly like the idea of becoming a slimmer, healthier version of me, but it seems to me that this is yet another in a long list of ways that people try to find a short-cut to better health. Eat less, eat healthier foods (more fruits and veggies, less saturated fat and sugar, etc.) and get more exercise... very simple, but it takes time. Most people realize that putting on the weight took a lot of time, but they have an all or nothing attitude when it comes to losing the weight..... 1-2lbs a week??? NO WAY!!! I need to lose 75lbs in the next month or it doesn't count! Anywho - juicing may be a great part of a healthier diet, but why does it have to be all juice and nothing else? How about some juice, some smoothies, some whole/raw fruits and veggies and some lean proteins.... maybe even some whole grains. I know, crazy... right?"
2,What?,"EXERCISE, you lazy people. Move! It's what you were designed to do. Everyone wants an easy out or an excuse. If you have time to watch this video, you have time to walk, jog, swim, or lift... play with your kids or your pets, run with your dog. Don't starve yourself, that's insanity. Eat smart, keep your metabolism going, and move your body!"
5,Watch it at least once!,"If you are an amazon prime its free so why not? If not it is still worth it. My brother did a fast just like this years ago and got off all his meds. Not because he stopped taking them but because the doctor took him off! It really is good information and these people that give it one star are clearly not educated on the subject. I heard someone say the other day that being ""too healty"" is bad for you. Get educated, see a doctor and be safe and always aim for ""too healthy""."
5,Great knife,"Wonderful balance, great grip and stylish! Good value - keeps its edge and is easy to clean and care for!"
2,Sounds drunken,"I know that this recording is very beloved in classical music circles, but I do not like it at all. It is slow, meandering, and sounds drunk. I feel sad to say this, because I know that Perlman is prodigiously talented."
1,What a joke,"This book was a total dissappointment. No technical information was available esp. on H.323 which is supposed to be a leading standard in the world of VoIP. This book should have been given a different title, like IPv4 vs IPv6."
4,Insightful!,"Richard Koch follows up his best-selling The 80/20 Principle with this engrossing look at science's universal principles (biological, physical and non-linear) at work in the business world. Richly detailed and splendidly written, this page-turner will change the way you look at every aspect of business. Koch shows you how innovation and success happen when you work with Mother Nature, and not against her. Don't worry if you slept through high school and college science classes, the author guides you smoothly through scientific theories as he applies them to business. We from getAbstract highly recommend this soon-to-be-classic to everyone in the business world, even if you are a former physics flunkie."
1,"Zero Credibility...""Journalist For Sale to Highest Bidder""","David Brock, once the darling of the conservative right, now tries to claim that he was somehow coerced by the right and the money...so how does he remake himself? He grabs the cash offered up by the left and becomes a hired gun of the left. He alledges that he is the watchdog of all things conservative media...out to correct all the wrongs, errors and call to task Rush Limbaugh and friends. Please! this guy as ZERO Credibility! Hasn't any one wondered why the attack dogs of the left; Brock, Michael Moore, Algore, Ted Kennedy, George Soros, etc...are all of questionable credibility? Why can't the left bring forth an intelligent spokesperson who has more to offer then anybody but Bush?"
5,Good book-Kindle formatting issues though,"SJ Rozan is one of my favorite authors. In fact, I check periodically to see if she's written anything new. Her Bill and Lydia Chin characters are standouts in the detective genre.Having spent a lot of time in Hong Kong, made Reflecting the Sky even more fun to read. The locations and descriptions make you feel like you are there with Bill and Lydia.Having said that, there are so many typos, it's annoying. The word ""the"" is ""die"" throughout, and a great deal of time is spent trying to figure out what the misspelled words are actually supposed to be. Whoever did the formatting for the Kindle should seek another line of work!So, 5 stars for the storyline, and 1 star for Amazon Kindle."
1,Lousy products,"I have purchased two Mr. Coffee perculators. One Black and one White. Both have little buttons in the bottom of the area where the water is poured to start the coffee. BOTH have had the little ""button"" push out then bounce around in there and now that is what has happened to the Black one (the newest of the two) I put it back into the hole and it still won't work. I have lost the instructions to the pot and cannot get the clock or the timer to work. I will not purchase another Mr. Coffee. The black has a pretty shinny pot............worthless.

4,Vintage Poi,"When you listen to this cd, you will wonder why was this left out. There are some wonderful songs here from 'Over the Top' which highlights the guitar work of Dag Juhlin, and was soon cannibalized for 'God's Gallipoli'. to a wonderful song 'Better Than This' which highlights the incredible songwriting technics of Frank Orrall.This cd is a must for old time Poi fans. If for no other reason that to hear this juked up version of 'The Chain'. They performed this version live at Grant Park in Chicago back in 95 I believe. Wow."
1,Tries Hard to Be Authentically Soulful But Way Off the Mark,"Why do some singers try SO hard to be ""soulful""? Guess cause it doesn't come to them naturally or instinctively. He's an okay singer, but certainly not even close to a real soul singer. He tries to mimic the real thing. And the unenlightened may buy it. Barry White? More like Betty White...meets Pia Zadora as Judy."
1,"Lifeless, dull, tedious and a mess","Sam's failed attempt to rise from his long obscurity. Perhaps live these songs work, but here on CD, they are merely a strange and ineffective musical melange."
1,Not the same Sam Harris I know,"I saw the show ""The Life"" with Sam Harris and liked him a great deal. I felt the same about ""Standard Time"" disc but ""Revival is not the same Sam Harris. I don't think he needed a revival and this disc is proof of it."
5,Strongest Microstoria album,"What kind of bothered me at times about Microstoria's other two albums was that they seemed to sort of meander about with no real ambition. While I've gotten used to--and really started to enjoy--the quiet atmospheric approach, this racier and more substantial album feels like what I'd initially expected from the group, also the song structures are tighter and more robust.While, like the other two studio albums the instrumentation is entirely electronic, mostly of glitches and a range in tones, there are much more memorable moments.Definitely my favorite of the three M albums, I still enjoy the other two almost as much, it's just that this one is closer I suppose to my own musical tastes."
1,The Hidden Truth,"I rely upon the customer reviews and take a chance when all comments are favorable. Anyone expecting to find a soothing CD to use as a peaceful background for relaxation or meditation should be forewarned.This CD begins serenely until minute 12:00 when the tone becomes shrill and frenetic. This agony continues for a painfully long 2 minutes and then re-appears minute 23:00, 42:00, and finally in minute 53:00. Why these turbulent, high-pitched sounds were inserted is a mystery.I hope this gives you an idea of what to expect from a CD with so much promise"
5,Calming CD!,"This CD is very relaxing, calming and I listen to it at night as I am falling asleep. Perfect for persons who have insomnia!!! Helps the mind segue from alertness to a relaxing sleep."
5,Comment,"I know you will look at this before you put it up so I wanted to tell you that this tape is by Bob Griswold and should be listed with his other tapes. I would like to put a link on my page for all Bob Griswold tapes so if you would like to recategorize this it would be great, thanks."
5,Stunning,I in fact got both this and the other one offered..for paperdoll and decoupage projects..the paper is first quality as is the printing and coloring..its just perfect for what I wanted to use it for.B.W.
1,"descriptions state 43 costumes, costume duplicated -- only 26 to count of!!",This print is a complete rip-off. Costumes all duplicated through out the book.
4,good book,I like this book. It carries more detail then the APA standard on more breeds. recomend for one who is into bantams.
5,Venom figure,"I am so totally thrilled with my purchase! My husband loves Venom and has begun collecting. This is an awesome start to his personal collection. I ordered this item last friday and it has already arrived today, Monday! Perfect arrival time as it is Christmas Eve, eventhough it wasn't set to arrive until after the first of the year!! Thank you so much!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"As an avid collector I was blown away at the detail I saw. I've seen others that just do not do Venom justice. This is a ""must have"" for any Marvel collector or Spider-man series fan."
1,Irked,"It's how I felt after reading this steaming pile of...er, manuscript. I don't know what it's like to never finish a book--to me, every book is a ""can't-put-it-down-must-read."" This piece of...er, bound matter made me wish, with every turn of a page, either for the end or a nice sharp ice-pick in my skull. ANYTHING to rid myself of the misery. It is neither great nor commanding in its poorly drawn attempt to sweep all of gay history into a neat pile. Avoid this book. For the love of literature, avoid it at all costs."
3,Implausible trash I couldn't put down,"Not a word of this book is believable. The main characters hop from what seems like the set of Ozzie and Harriet, to Malibu, to Woodstock to Fire Island...without worry of money or jobs that entail real work. All the men are beautiful. The protagonist's first gay sexual experience is without trauma or conflict, and he adjusts to calling himself a gay man seemingly overnight. Uh huh, right. Still and all, I could not put this down. Fun, trashy, sad at times...don't expect Capote or Maupin, and you won't be disappointed."
5,Wonderful book to spend an afternoon with!,"It's just a perfect book to spend a lazy afternoon lounging by the pool on a hot summer day. The story flows easily, there is plenty of humor in it, fast and witty dialogs, and the butler Reeves is quite a character!"
4,"It's not bad. Not the best, but pretty good","I've been using this knife in a professional environment for the past 6 months or so and it's not bad.I bought it to replace a cheap Wusthof Gourmet 8"" chef's knife that ""disappeared"" at work last year and it's of comparable quality - stamped blade, light weight, relatively soft steel, and good balance.For everyday use, it's perfectly fine. It takes an edge well and holds onto it for a reasonable amount of time (under VERY heavy use) with daily passes on the steel. I like the balance of the knife, but it's neither heavy enough for grunt work nor light enough for endurance prep projects.The people that write GLOWING reviews about Global knives either use them at home or have never experienced a hand-forged japanese knife. The Global isn't bad, but it's far from the best. It's a good working knife if you know how to keep it sharp."
3,Handle is for a small hand,We have an older model of this knife and love it. We returned this one because the handle was much smaller and we found it uncomfortable. I wear a size 7 1/2 glove so my hands are probably medium-sized. I was sorry about the handle as otherwise we really like the knife.
5,I love it,"I used this for my work everyday.. Its cool, looks fancy and it is a great tools if you use everyday at the kitchen.."
5,Perfect,"I recently got this knife; I had been wanting a Global Chef's knife since I was given a Global utility knife as a gift. I was very impressed with it, to say the least.This knife is very sharp and Stays sharp. Unlike the famous European colleagues that look very classic, but go dull in a short time and require round the clock steeling and sharpening, the Global can do the same amount of work with much less upkeep.I would recommend this knife to anyone working in a kitchen, commercial or home use.It is extremely light, and perfectly balanced. I use it at work, and it has never let me down. I do recommend the handheld sharpener for touch-ups, it returns the blade to a close factory edge.It should be noted that the handle should be kept dry when you are working, because it will slip because of the nature of the design. That is it's only flaw."
1,Mediocre,"I took this album because I had a gift certificate. dead skin mask, angel of death and die by the sword are the only ones worth listening to."
1,WARNING: Unbox episode is CENSORED,"The pilot episode on Unbox is the censored, 'G' rated version.The nude scene on the DVD is missing from the Unbox video."
1,bad plugs,"install these plugs in my 2005 Tundra. Ran great for 3K miles, then, engine light came on P0306..missing number 6 cylinder.. pull the plug out, bad plug.. junked all 6.. put back the OE denso plugs, no problem, runs fine.. never had any issue with Autolite until now...will I ever buy Autolite spark plugs again, remain to be seen.."
4,Pretty Decent! I like it!,"I'm glad I brought this DVD after contemplating about it for a year. What I like most about it is that there are Authentic Spanish people in it - which is Great for a change. I like this a lot for my 2 yr old, and it's great practice for myself as well - as we are both learning Spanish. The dog singing I could could see that being hard to understand for a child learning. The one of the best parts of this DVD, is when the dog says ""Muy Bien""! Me and my child both love that part. What I don't care for about this dvd, is a small child won't be able to do the quizzes until he knows how to work the remote. But overall, I'm very satisfied, that I brought this, and I love forward to buying all that they put out when learning Spanish. I give it 4 stars. It covers a decent amount of beginning Spanish. Also, my son does enjoy this DVD as well - it holds his attention, and he does understand a good bit of Spanish, we've been learning since he was about 5 months old."
2,Nice remote spoiled by lousy battery cover,"This remote has a very nice layout and a good code database. It could learn from several different remotes, but the memory was limited and I did run out of space.However, the fit and finish are not very good. The battery door comes off way too easily. When it does, the batteries typically come flying out too. That is very annoying when watching a movie!So, I'm returning it and will continue my search."
4,"Good Book, Why Buy It?",This is a good book on balloon flying but why should you pay for it? You can download the pdf version free from the FAA website. Just Google the title.
3,I didn't realize the fairytales had been written and rewritten by so many authors,Some were move gruesome than this one and some much kinder. We read this as research to go with another book of fairytales we were reading
3,Nothing special. Not as pictured,"I was disappointed to find that the corkscrew I was sent did not have the rubber strip across the top of the bottle opener part of the corkscrew as shown in the picture. It only has black rubber on the tips of the handles.Ignoring that, the corkscrew is not that much better than the generic, and much, much cheaper versions that you see in stores all the time. It's not particularly well made, and the corkscrew itself isn't coated to facilitate easy screwing into the cork.The ring to protect the bottle top is cheap plastic and the entire unit is not fitted together well.I'm sure that it will work adequately for opening wine, but it is much less than I expected for the price and by the description and reviews."
3,Credible first attempt,"I read this book because after a long career as a very skilled technician, I find myself in senior management. It is past time to learn the game. And have no doubts there is always a game, and that you really want to win it. If you're not playing it, you better pray your boss is playing and winning. I think there are valuable insights in this book, awkwardly written. It has some credible information but at the same time indulges in whiny gossip. My impression is that Readon looked at the competition and decided she could write a book and make some money. At the same time she wanted to do something intellectually credible. Unfortunately she's primarily an academic and I don't think up to writing what one of my management profs called an 'airport bookstore idle moment read'. The result is a book that lacks the easy read without the intellectual substance. I'd be interested in a more serious effort by the same author."
4,Natalie Merchant was NOT 10KM,"This album is a wonderful collection of folk-like and slightly experimental pop tunes. I found it to be much more interesting than the 1997 release ""Love Among The Ruins"". The upbeat title track describes a whirlwind tour of the continental U.S., ""so much there to see inside of a week."" ""Once A City"" is also nice, with a good beat and layered instrumentation. The lyrics of ""Cabaret"" tell an amusing story while the music has a bit of ska flavor, not unlike some of the original Maniacs' earliest recordings. What's most interesting about this CD are the 15-30 second snippets of music that come between the tracks."
5,Excellent Choice,"As a former camper at Skip Ross' youth camps, I initially read this book 20 years ago and have re-read many times since. It continues to be, in my humble opinion, the greatest guide in acheiving success and healthy self esteem. This book is perfect for anyone at any age who wants to learn to reach their full potential."
3,Perspective with Pain,"There is a title on perspective drawing called ""Perspective without Pain"", acknowledging that trying to learn perspective drawing can be quite ""painful"", depending upon the ability of the teacher/author to explain the process with a minimum of technical jargon or over-detailed explanations. Trying to learn perspective from Dines was very painful. Dines loves to use $20 words where $5 words would do. He almost seems to be flashing his knowledge at you with his technical word usages. I am no nearer being able to draw perspective than I was before I bought this book. I am now searching for a different author who can teach me perspective in a simpler manner. There has to be an easier way!"
2,"Competant, radio-friendly, comedy-rock","High Speed Scene's entire musical vocabulary conists of Marcy Playground, Nada Surf and Weezer, and I'd be shocked if any member of this band is over the age of 19. Their self-titled album is packed with tight yet instantly forgettable joke-songs, and the glossy production neuters any impact one would expect from a rock album. Harmless, well-crafted and radio-friendly, they've created the perfect soundtrack to the next American Pie movie or Sprite commercial."
5,Best knife ever,"I brought my knives as part of a block. At the time I thought it was a shame it came with a bread knife and not something else.I'm so glad I have this knife. We regularly comment how amazing it is. Probably every time we cut a bread roll in fact. Never are my rolls squished while cutting, the bread stays in whole pieces, it's not 'hacked' open like with other bread knives. You ave to own one to understandHave since brought the single knife as a gift."
5,Sharpest knife I've ever owned,"After using a few times, I may convert to Japanese-made knives for all of my kitchen cutlery. It feels borderline weightless compared to my Calphalon Katana chef's and santoku knives, and it cuts ""like buttah."" Granted the Katanas are excellent for chopping, but the Bunmei is my new go-to blade for slicing. I used it to slice a grilled beef tenderloin roast and was amazed at how effortlessly it glided through the meat. The handle is perfect for my small hands, but even my husband (whose hands are gargantuan) commented on how much he likes the way it feels. He bought this one for me and immediately said ""we're getting the 12 inch too."" And Yoshihiro Cutlery is an excellent vendor; they snail mailed me a thank you note separately from the knife, which was a very thoughtful gesture. I think I'm a patron for life now..."
3,a whole lot of nothing much,"i agree with most reviews here, the writing is wonderful, but it is wonderful in the same terms as a really good tv advert. it catches the eye, it holds the attention, it makes you think, but it never seems to want to linger. it's all 30 second bites and bits. the book goes no where, it does nothing. it is simply a series of nice images, thoughtful moments. there is no character development, David Winkler never 'becomes' anything we care about, he simply shrugs along. the tale of Grace and Sandy again feels like nothing, smoke or dust rather then flesh and blood. the whole book is a dissapointing exercise in navel gazing - for such a fascinating premise this really is a waste of time and effort - i would not recommend it at all and have only given it 3 stars for the obvious effort Doerr went to with writing and research, as a reader I can honestly say this is a tedious offering, insipid and dull."
3,Intriguing premise slowed by lack of character............,"This wasn't an aweful book, nor was it a good one. Anthony Doerr begins with an intriguing premise, a human who is able to fortell the future. He forsees one of our worst nightmares his own child's death. What follows is alot of dreamy prose about nature and love and life but not alot of plot movement. This novel reminded me of Michael Ondaatje's writing with one exeption, the characters lacked strength and purpose. What is one's life experience worth if they have not learned from it? Our main character schlumps through life, never really taking the time to find out if his daughter lived? Cmon......no wonder she was so mad and the reader feels her irritation as almost to say to Doerr ""enough already."""
1,A struggle to get through this one.,"This is an excellent story with great potential for characterdevelopment and reader involvement. Unfortunately, it's simplytoo long and encumbered with excessive description and ofteninappropriate metaphors. There is lots of extraneous discussionabout snow and insects which, although possibly interesting initself, did not seem to have anything to do with the story.Although it picked up a bit at the end, I had to struggle mostof the way. And the ending didn't make sense; Winkler didn'teven tell his daughter why he left, which was the main pointof the story!"
4,Suspenseful and Beautiful,"Doerr's imagery is beautiful and at some points the book is really vividly suspensful. The major themes of this book include (in my humble opinion), the fluidity of life, the uniqueness of everything, the pain of loss and the redemption of found relationships.I actually found the book very hard to put down -- which is really a contrast to some of the reviews I've read.There were a couple of very small parts that dragged a touch, but for the most part this book kept me up all night - in a good way."
1,I'm afraid that I grew to hate this book....,"This book was selected by my book club. I found the premise very intriguing (a man who can foretell events that he will later witness), and I really enjoyed the first half. However, I found the third quarter of the book unbelievably slow and painful to plod through. The description was wonderful, and the writing finely crafted, but very, very little happened for much too much of the book. The ending became more compelling, but I never got past how much I disliked a good portion of it. Almost everyone in my book club agreed that we found ourselves skimming whole pages just to get to an actual event. I really think that a good editor should have suggesting cutting about 100 pages from the middle of this book. Sorry, but I can't recommend...."
4,All Around Great Show!,"I have to admit, I like this show. Which is very strange coming from a 30 year old guy. I used to work for a friend taking care of her kids. So I was stuck most of the time watching kid shows. I come around to really enjoying this show. Although the show is not realistic at all, it's still a fun show. Even though I have moved on to another line of work I still find myself watching this on occasions."
5,Thankyou,My niece got her gift promptly and in good order and is enjoying the movie I would definetly recommend your buisness to other customers. I am very satisfiedThankyou again
5,Love Global Knives,"We already had a Global Chef Knife when we got this 3 piece set last Christmas. We tried Global after buying a dissappointing Henkel. We are now diehard Global fans. When I visit people's homes and they have dull knives, I am further in love with my Global. It makes such a difference to have a good knife when cooking! Pay bon marche bon!"
4,Real Rock n Roll,"I have listened to countless bands and attended many concerts. Folks, this is the best rock band I have ever heard. I love Skynard, Led Zep, and AC/DC just like many. But, you will not find a more mechanically rhythmic, diverse, and captivating rock band anywhere.You may read reviews where people complain about the lighting used in this dvd - well, those people have never been to the 40 Watt. Others say some really good songs were missing. That is true, but they have so many great songs it would be hard to fit them all. This is a must have for fans of the band and for fans of great rock n roll."
2,Not such a great book,"I found this book to be a little too much for my 4 year old. I did not like the fact that the book says 'it will not hurt' and shows a picture of a needle for novacaine shot. I realize the shots are probably inevitable, but telling a child it will not hurt is unrealistic. I should have read the content before I purchased the book."
3,Terrible Mess,"They smell ok and warm alright, but so much of the oil had leaked out of the packaging that the box and the foam inside were soaked through and it bled through the box or another item I'd purchased with this one. Some of the bottles had leaked as much as a third of their contents. It took me an hour to get everything sufficiently clean to present it to my boyfriend and by then I wasn't much in the mood to use them. I might have returned them, but it would have been more hassle than it's worth and a replacement set would probably have had the same problem. The product is ok overall, but I'd recommend finding a supplier near you and avoid bottles that have been shaken up, jostled around, and dropped upside down in shipping."
1,AWFUL,I received this package several days later than I was supposed to and all the bottles were either broken and leaking or just leaking! there was nothing in the HUGE box with it so it was just tumbling around.
3,Three Stars (as given by a UGA fan)...,"I purchased this book as part of my boyfriend's Christmas. Prior to wrapping it, I decided to sift through the book to learn tidbits about Ohio State... I actually enjoyed it and my blood smells of SEC! lolMy boyfriend, now my ex, loved the book and he's not much of a reader, so that's saying a lot... especially since it wasn't a picture book. :o)"
3,"A little light on details, but nice photos","If you're purchasing this book, you're probably taking a class on the material. This info is pretty well summarized in almost any other text book on the topic. That being said, it's cited a lot so it's not a bad reference item to have. It's also nice to get more of a ""big picture"" perspective without a ton of details bogging you down."
2,Disappointing,Should've been sold to Linda Perry fans instead of P!nk fans. As there was much more footage of her than anyone else. Disappointed. Boring. Was repeated a few times.
3,Interesting but not fully accurate.,"A very entertaining romp into a world most of us will never know. Unfortunately the references to absinthe are grossly exagerated and at times, ridiculously inaccurate. But do not be deterred, this is well written if not a bit wordy and quite a story, one that should be told."
1,the book of knowledge; the keys of enoch,"Got. to. be . kiddin'. Waste of paper. Waste of time. Makes no sense. Lotsa errors. Lots. Really lots. That is my opinion, but think whatever you want. With authors like Thomas Troward, Eckhart Tolle, and book""A Course in Miracles' - well, what else could you possibly need ? Trust your inner teacher, in-tuition, regarding choice."
3,3 inch binders,"As long as teachers insist on 3 inch binders, you may as well go for reasonably priced ones. I found this product to fit the bill. Decent, not great, but priced OK. Holds up as long as the super-high priced ones. Why pay more?"
3,Interesting personal accounts of World War II Tankers,"In ""Brothers in Arms"", Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Anthony Walton try to bring to life the personal accounts of the soldiers of the 761st Tank Battalion.The book begins by documenting the memories of the soldiers who faced their own battles with racism here in the United States. The flow of the book follows the natural progression of the soldiers from their days as recruits, armored school, and then through their combat exploits in France and Germany.Having previously read ""Death Traps: The Survival of an American Armored Division in World War II"", this book didn't contribute any new information about armored warfare. Despite numerous factual errors, the book does highlight the ugliness of racism that was prevalent in the nation at the time. All in all, this is a collection of stories that needed to be told."
3,For completists only,"This book should appeal to both X-Men and Avengers fan alike. Which is to say not too much. Although the story isn't bad per se, and there's an interesting development for Magneto, it's nothing out of the ordinary either. For a meeting between two of Marvel's biggest teams you'd expect a great story and great art. What you get is a decent job of both, but again, nothing to write home about."
1,get real.....,You know this guy must have more skeletons and dead hookers in his closet than you could shake 2 sticks at.Talk about over compensation.Either that or he really did short circuit somewhere along the way and has allowed himself to become consumed by all this inner-power hooplah.Tony you're some type of new half Richard Simmons - half Robert Tilton cyborg. Preying on the lunatics and the esteem challenged. I wanted to see what he was about so i bought this book. As you may have gathered I wasn't overtly impressed.
2,"Not original, but still, it IS Lalo...","Disappointed to find out that the CD was a re-recording by Lalo back in 1999 (said so in the Liner notes, but it might have swayed my purchase had I seen this tidbit on the OUTSIDE of the cover).Still, it's a fun CD to listen to. Lalo is Lalo, regardless of WHEN the recording took place. However, collecting purists will likely pan this CD cause it isn't the original release.Am I sorry I bought this CD? No. The general feeling of the show and the time period are adequately conveyed. A little of the edge is gone.Perhaps one day they'll resurrect the original soundtrack and digitally remaster it! I'll buy that, too!"
2,Precious and sleep-inducing,"Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Kate Rusby's voice and solo recordings. But boy oh boy, this one puts me to sleep. Of course the singing is beautiful, but it doesn't have any of the energy that Rusby's solo cds have. That energy is particularly important with music that can easily sound like precious museum pieces. Buy Rusby's other stuff; it's all wonderful."
3,OK Product,"Thought I would try this brand of Flaxseed Oil - my doctor suggests Flaxseed Oil for ""hot flashes"" - this isn't working as well as the other brand I have been taking - will go back to the other brand."
4,Tonka Tractor Set,"My son got this set for his 2nd birthday. He loves tractors, so I knew he would love this one. It is a nice size, not too small and not too big. It's plastic and lightweight, so it's easy for him to carry.The trailer doesn't stay hooked up to the tractor. It would be better if the trailor hitch had a hook instead of a button. Everytime my son picks the set up, they come apart and he tells me to ""fix it."""
5,Great skirt for this price,"I was very surprised about the high quality of this skirt for only 9.99 USD. It looks simply great! Maybe if your are too much overpounded this is not the skirt for you. However, I'm not too much overpounded and liked this skirt very much. I own the faded denim color and it's really beautiful. A good quality skirt. True fit."
4,Great Skirt,I had been looking for a new denim skirt for a while and found this one on Amazon. The skirt is lightweight and I love the length. Washes and dries easily too!
2,Music Coming To An Elevator Near You...,"This is just awful! I'm a huge fan of U2 and have been since the beginning. However, I just can't ""get into"" this music. U2's music is for guitars, bass, and soaring vocals, not strings and horns. I'd pass on this cd."
2,"no tension, just imitation.....but","whoever mania of U2, when they meet the title, feel like crazily getting and hearing it. But right after U hear it, you may throw it due to terrible imitation by RPO. But it also have something new, U2 ,classic tune and wired Jazz, sound-like so strange though, it can make a new feeling for example Desire and who's gonna ride your wild horses. the later is the best in this album. the others are trashes es pecially 'one'. For me, so hard to get it, in south Korea it's not issued. terrible sound but it's OK. this album realize me one more time how much wonderful U2 playing U2."
1,disasterous,"This is the absolute worst cd that bears the name of U2. The Royal Philharmonic has taken these masterpieces and completely butchered them. The only song that is somewhat tolerable is One, and believe me, that's not saying much. When I heard Bono's voice redone with the oboe, I knew that I had had enough. Although, if you're a musak fan, this cd may be for you. These songs will be coming to an elevator near you!"
1,Violation of your ears,"The best part of this CD is the bass players cleavage on the front. I'm a diehard U2 fan so when I bought this, I was hoping for sounds like I would hear from John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) or James Horner (Braveheart, Titanic) but all I got was some crap you'd hear in an elevator. I felt like I was in a Macy's department store. People who like this album are listening to a totally different album than I am. This is one selection that should be discontinued. It's like it was rushed into production so the RPO just cobbled it together. Listen to some sample music before you buy. It's not worth your time. If you look at the majority of the reviews on this page, you'll see what I mean..."
1,Too many horns,As the count said in the movie Amadeus .. 'Too Many Notes' .. there are simply too many horns .. and not enough strings.Acoustic strings. There is plenty of either electric guitar or 'electric violin' but either way .. there is too much electric.I like classical music .. I like U2. I thought this would be a beautiful blend .. one I could get my mom and dad for Christmas.I played mine once .. and it's off to the used CD store. Too bad.
4,A rockin' good time!,"This CD is so much fun for our daughter. Nothing beats those great ole tunes. You can't help but dance to this music with your child! My only complaint is there are a few songs that we skip over, but most of them are worth listening to time and time again."
5,A NEW TALENT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED.. GREAT WRITING PAX..,"GREAT WESTERN, THE WRITER HOLDS YOU SPELLBOUND RIGHT UP TOO THE LAST PAGE.. HIS CHARACTER'S COME TOO LIFE.. ALL YOU NEED IS A HOT CUP OF COFFEE AND A COMFORTABLE CHAIR, AND SET BACK AND ENJOY AGREAT WESTERN..."
5,Excellent reading,My husband and I enjoyed this book very much. It was very informative and very enlightening. I have recommended it to all of our friends who are interested in Chicago history.Thank you.
5,A rare five-star read,"This was one of the most delightful, satisfying books I've read all year. I loved being inside Abby's mind and understanding her desires, needs, regrets and sadness. This character came off as a real human being. I was frustrated with Abby being such a doormat to Lavinia, but it was such a genuine part of her personality, one I could relate to (unfortunately!), that it didn't take away from her endearment to me. I also enjoyed the antiques aspect of the book, as I can relate to coming upon a good 'find' (though not on the caliber of Abby's of course).I hated to come to the end of this book. It was sheer pleasure from the first page to the last. I am definitely putting Ms. Medwed's other titles on my to-read list."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, when I first heard STEPS i thought, probably something dinky if boys and girls are singing together, but they are actually pretty good. They have good tunes. THe voices are okay but I think I prefer S CLub 7 for my co-ed group of singers. THis is still a good CD and if you like pop you'll like this one."
5,Best All-Round Cooking Show on TV....LOVE IT,"I can not get enough of this show. I just started watching the show this year and now want to go back and see all the shows I have missed. Along with great recipes, they give cooking dos and don'ts, taste tests, and reviews of all things for cooking.They will actually show examples of cooking gone wrong! Love that. I also have 2 of their cookbooks which are illustrated and will explain why they pick a certain process, this advice I need because sometimes I may try and cut corners if I don't understand why I need to follow instructions exactly.Highly reccommend!!! I will be buying these cookbooks and DVDs for Christmas presents."
1,boring,Some of the greatest musicians in jazz creating some very poor music. What a disappointment. The music goes nowhere. It is a shame because the line up of players id awesome.
1,A big disappointment. Not the book for the 70-296,"As a technical trainer with over 16 years of experience under my belt, I know a thing or two about proper training. When searching for a tool to train my MCSE 2003 students, I had high expectations for this book. I've used Exam Cram many times in the past and have even been pleased with the progress of Exam Cram 2. However, this book completely disappointed me. It's evident that Schmied hasn't even taken the time to sit for the exam himself. His gross misjudgments and oversights are too obvious and profound to be ignored. My greatest hope at this point is the Que can salvage this title with a second author rewrite or additional edit. I certainly won't be recommending this book to my students. Shame on you, Will Schmied."
2,Very poor padding,"This ironing board has a nice large surface which I appreciate but, the ironing board cover is terrrible. It has very thin padding and after a few uses the padding feels non existent. I'm having a horrible time trying to find a new cover and pad that willl fit this particular board because it's so large. I purchased it at Bed Bath and Beyond and sadly, even they don't have covers large enough to replace this weak thing that the manufacturer provided. I've had to rig a makeshift cover and pad. It's very disappointing because I expected so much more from Rowenta."
1,Typhoon Oil Mister,Completely Useless. Don't know why this was sold as it obviously did not work . Just threw it into the trash
3,You get what you paid for,"This works very well so long as you do not pump it up too far. Where exactly to draw the line to determine ""too far"" was a messy trial an error process.I have not purchased more expensive sprayers and cannot attest to whether or not they have a more or less finicky upper limit, but I did give myself one heck of an EVOO covered countertop on a couple of occasions."
1,Broke in under a month,"Broke almost right away. If you are trying to be ""green"" or save $$ this is the wrong item as it will break as if it is disposable and turn into junk."
2,Arrived Broken,"My Typhoon Stainless Steel and Acrylic Mist Oil Sprayer arrived broken. Currently waiting for a replacement.There are more expensive models available at Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel. At around $30, perhaps they're worth the extra money.Kudos to Amazon for their simple return / exchange program."
1,Painfully slow.,"A novel that encompasses exactly one day should not take several months to read. The endless parade of minute, obscure detail completely overwhelms the story. After nearly a year of reading this clunker off and on, I gave up."
4,Daunting Mexican Journey,"I found the book depressing. I could not stay with it without seeking relief in lighter or more action packed stories. It resembles Ulysses in that it takes place in one day and is literate, though Ulysses is harder to follow than this book. I understand it's a classic and I'm glad I read it but there are other books I've enjoyed more and look back on more fondly. I don't understand why there are so many untranslated Spanish passages. It seems exclusionary."
3,Literary Equivalent of Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls,"Many years ago I went to the movies to see Andy Warhol's film ""Chelsea Girls"". The film was several hours long and depicted life among the junkies, artists and assorted street people living in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan. The movie was very long and boring and very little seemed to be happening as the dreary and boring lives of the characters were painfully dragged out. Many people left the theater befor the move was over but I stuck it out. On the way home it hit me that the movie's purpose was to induce in the viewer the utter boredom and hopelessness that the characters were experiencing.It seems the purpose of this very difficult to read and never-ending book is to induce in the reader the confusion, time dilation, and nonsensical point of view of a man in the last throws of alcoholic disease. Well done."
5,worked great for my vacation,"I stayed at The Red Vic in Haight-Ashbury, a little off the beaten path. This map and my weeklong muni pass paid for themselves a gabillion times. The map worked great; I was never lost. The way they depict the touristy section of Lombard Street makes me giggle."
4,Works well except print too small,Used map while visiting San Francisco and it worked well. The print was too small for me to read even with my glasses. A family member read it.The laminated map held up well.
5,Simple and powerful habit building book.,"Being a long time fan of Brian Tracy I sometimes feel that his message is just to simple to actually work. However, every time he writes a new book I gain new ideas and new action steps to take in bettering myself. The simple and powerful message of this book is what makes it so effective. Don't think of the book as a money making book, (despite the title) think of the book as a manual on how to create new habits. Tracy's action steps and philosphy can make a difference in your life."
4,ADF Brings the Pain!!,"Lets see...Jungle beats? Check. Warbling basslines? Check. Driving guitars? Check. Ragga vocals? Check. Eastern rhythms & melodies, socially conscious lyrics, all wrapped up with punk sensibility? Check, Check and Check.On Tank, Asian Dub Foundation delivers the goods once again. From the fiery opening foot-stomper of ""Flyover"" to the closing organic lush of ""Melody 7"", ADF comes correct and lays down an album worthy of multiple repeat listenings. Without falling into cliched sounds and rhythms, ADF has stayed true to form while also showing something new on several tracks. The track ""Hope"" showcases a rollicking bassline, mated with vocals that would remind one of Horace Andy, and all of this on top of a haunting background melody. For those who love the inner city breakbeat music, I highly recommend this album.And for the reviewer who felt that the band's name was ""misleading"", I would suggest spending time with this group's back catalog."
3,A stellar conductor walks through the Requiem,"I am a huge fan of Franz Welser-Most (even flying from Santa Fe to Cleveland expressly to hear him conduct Mahler), but this Mozart Requiem from early in his career is mostly indifferent. Clearly Welser-Most had an idea here: to give us a lyrical, singing reading that would achieve a kind of gentle lift-off. That happens here and there, and it's a relief not to hear this work punched out like the crack of doom. But the overall effect feels too generalized (I don't get a hint of religious emotion), and he rushes some of the most beautiful passages, such as the Benedictus. The vocal quartet and chorus are fine, but the whole affair has little to offer that's special."
4,A fine collection,"Every track on the album is at least pretty good.""The claw"" by Clint Black is a tricky piece deftly handled.""Java man"" by Michael hedges is a work of virtuosity.""Liquid Amber"" by Laurence Juber has all the dreaminess the title implies.""Marina"" by Skip Ewing and B.J.Walker Jr. is one the most lovely,sun drenched,yet melancholy pieces of music you'll ever hear.But the most brilliant work on the album has to be ""Sadhana"" by Steve Stevens.This vibrant,rhythmically manic tour through the possibilities of the guitar has to be heard to be believed.Great sound,balance and superb artist selection."
5,A Captivating Album for Acoustic Guitar Fans,"As a guitar player, one test I use for how much I like an album is simply the number of songs I take the time to transpose off of it. I took the time to figure out 6 of these songs, which is 3x more than a 'good' album. This is a fabulous set of tunes, and highly recommended. A Wonderful Album!"
2,"cheap, poor shipping","The box looks decent, but when my fiancee opened up the exterior plastic covering the box, the top red button had already fallen off. She opened it up and the ""kama Sutra"" piece that was glue gunned to the inside of the box had already fell off as well (probably due to be stored in a warehouse that was too hot). And on top of that the massage oil (that stunk) had leaked over everything. The ""feather"" was tiny. I suggest creating your own ""bedside box"". This one is not worth it."
3,Just OK....fun for something new though.,"This product was what I expected. I did not like the honeysuckle honey dust though. When the box arrived everything smelled like it and it has a weird flowery, almost insence, scent. It's very overwhelming. The massage oil is great except that it was leaking when it arrived. This box is small but probably could be used a lot of times, a little bit of it goes a long way."
2,4 great dance songs does not make for a great CD!!,"The only four good tracks on this cd are #2,3,4 and 5 and they are all in a row. Usually record companies spread the fast dance songs out so there is a good blend of songs from fast to slow to fast again. I wasn't thrilled with the Bee Gee's Tragedy song remake either. Save your money and get the cassette. These four songs are terrific but this CD appears as if it was a rushed project. With more time and effort it could have been better produced like Vitamin C, Dream, La Bouche, or Mandy's First CD."
4,steps review,"I love foreign groups. Their songs (Steps) are extremely in style. I saw them in concert on Disney, and their dance moves are really great, too. Along with their costumes. I hope that I'm not the only one who likes them."
4,Still no O Boyz?,"How can anyone dislike Rappin' Drakken! I'm considering buying this CD just for that song, since I already have the CD without that song on it. Go Dr. D!"
1,sucked,"i cannot believe i attempted to read this horrible book. mildred, i mean seriously, who are you writing to? this book was a waste of a week. i had to force myself to read half the time! i got it as a present. i sure hope that someone nice gave me it because otherwise id have to...just no."
3,Taylor Tops it Off,"the exciting and engaging prequel to Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I lov ethis book! Can't wait till RTHMC comes out on Kindle!"
2,Total Fantasy,"Reading the summary of this book completely peeked my interest. After sitting and reading it over the couse of a week - my brain is screaming complete disappointment.Approximatly 70% of this book is comprised of recycled plots. Plots we've seen on tv (L-Word, Tois,) the other comes from the imagination of a potential non-lesbian. The remaining 30% was very well written. The plots were amazing and very creative.Overall the book is poorly written, the dialogue sucks, plots predictable and very far fetched -- all in all... i'm amazed the author is published. I was extremely disappointed in some of the stereotypical references and situations in the book. One of the associations between molestation and the homoseuality is borderline dangerous. I didnt care for this book at all. Save you're money - unless the book is being sold for $3 used."
1,Not what I expected,It was not what I expected. Did not know it was different short stories. One woman's opinion--do not suggest if you don't understand that lifestyle.
2,not what I expected,This fell short of my expectations big time. Listened to it once and resold it quickly. I probably didn't get the album I was looking for but thought this one was it. Good music for those who like it. Both artists were supreme entertainers and I have other albums of the Fania Allstars and they are on fire :D
5,FINALLY!!! DEVON IS IN THE PICTURE!!!,"DEVON IS LIKE SUCH A SWEET GUY!!! I LOVE HIM!!!!! BUT POOR FANG. ): OH WELL, YA CANT HAVE BOTH... OR CAN U?? LOL, EMILY IS SOO HILARIOUS IN FRANCE, SPRING BREAK!!! NOT FAIR!!!!"
2,5 pages of useful information...maybe,"I bought this book, and got the Kaplan book from the library. I finished this whole book in about an hour. It really doesn't say much worthwhile. There are pages and pages of information that is just so basic or out there that it is a waste of time to read.On the other hand, the Kaplan book had lots of good tips, steps to take to solve different types of problems, common questions and words, etc. It was a big help. Buy that one."
2,Get Barron's instead!,"I thought this was one of the more reputable GRE books, so I started my GRE studying with this book and unfortunately spent most of my time (up to two weeks before the GRE) on it. Then I opened up my Barron's book, and said ""This is SO much better than the other book!"" I really regret spending so much time with the Princeton Review. Needless to say, I spent the next two weeks cramming with Barron's. End result: 1490. Get Barron's instead. I'm not sure I used any of the info I learned in Princeton's."
3,It was ok...,"I think Ms. Butcher did have a wonderful idea for a retelling of Snow White BUT, the book was too short, too rushed and undeveloped. It tells the story of Ana, daughter of Queen Veda of Ran. Ana is beautiful and supposedly intelligent. She decides that the only way to win her mothers love and acceptance is to make herself look ugly. After awhile under this masquerade she is sent to the Acadamy for Girls, where she learns how intoxicating beauty can be...Now,Even though Ana shows some signs of intelligence on a whole she is pretty much just stupid. When did degrading yourself for others become right. And any suspicious pill being given out at school should be disposed of immediatly. I mean really, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE!!! One thing that Ms. Butcher should be appluaded for though is that she didn't ruin herself entirely by writing in an fake, unbelievable, happily ever after, fairy tale romance."
3,Um. . . . . .,"I love to read so when I saw this at the library I thought, "" Sure why not?"" Everything is jumping around in this book! You get no details what so ever. Poorly written. I was like um . . . . . . . . . . ?"
2,Run to Cadence,"Not quite what I expected. Being ex-Army I expected full cadences, but some where cut short and repeated the same song a couple times."
3,"Just a bridge, in many ways.","This book was just a convenient bridge - in many ways - to the continuing story line. Okay, so there are (in my estimation) two important events that move the grand arc of the story along, but the whole thing seemed much like a bit of fluff between the covers in order to justify writing so many pages. I recommend getting it as a piece of easy pulp reading, but not to expect too much. (Of course, if you expect pulp reading to be a bunch of fluff, then this is exactly what you should expect.)"
1,what the heck...,Agree strongly with whats been posted already. I awaited the printing of this book because the first 4 where great. this book left me disapointed and turned off to the whole series. What happened to ryld was a complete waste. If it had been for a purpose fine... but it seemed to be completly meaningless. I will not be picking up book 6.
3,Not as good but....,"The 5th book in WotSQ was average when compared to Books 1, 2 and 3 (book 4 also rather average) but still an entertaining read. Some of the battles dragged on a little too long (i.e Gromph vs. Dyrr and at one point, Nimor) for my liking though.I found Halisstra and Ryld's side-story rather uninteresting, if only because both are a little too bland for my liking. Quenthel, Danifae and Jeggred seem to have complete personality makeovers in this book which was somewhat odd. Quenthel's change was the most drastic. Noticeably absent is Vhok and Horgar as they seemingly vanish into thin air and the siege of Menzo is barely even touched upon.Thankfully the action picks up the last couple chapters and somewhat redeems this book. I have higher hopes for the conclusion however."
3,Nice appearance but disappointing drizzle,"The typhoon oil drizzler has a very nice appearance, and the glass seems to be high quality. Although it is supposed to drizzle oil, it seems to just pour it."
3,"Readable, inspiring, and NOT a good role model!","The book is fairly short, extremely readable, and a good example of how NOT to do this sort of thing. The author wrote up a list of extreme sports events he wanted to experience, despite being a self-described ""couch potato"". Bane did several items on his ""list"" without anything like the proper training or preparation.The short length of the book means that a disappointingly brief chapter covers each item on the list. There's not a lot of technical or ""how to do it"" information in here, though I doubt many will read this book for that. I admit I'd hoped for some discussion of the boring old administrative stuff involved in setting up adventures like these. There is some discussion of his internal mental experience, and a sort of rough-and-ready sports psychology.I enjoyed the book, but it scared the bejeezus out of me that anyone would do these things this hastily! An entertaining read for armchair extreme sporters, but not much more than that."
2,sloppy flip floppy,"I have several pairs of Cordani shoes, but these are really strange. It's like they are made for paws and not feet. The length is normal, but the thong and back support straps are so long, they barely stay on my feet."
2,Disappointed,"I love Liszt, and appreciate the contribution he made in his time when the piano as an instrument was relatively new. I do not recommend this CD. Good music, bad recording."
2,My Ghetto Report Card is not that good.,"My Ghetto Report 2 1/2 starsMy Ghetto report card is not that bad of an album, but it's not that great, E-40 Does his usual humor and antics, but it gets way too thing, although I Love some songs on the album and his writing if effective, but the lyrics are too heavy handed and too stilted, the production is decent, but what is the album trying to say?"
4,"Not a classic, but a great summer read.","The Right Address is very cynical, very cutting and really kind of funny. The wit and satire that went into this book makes it a perfect summer weekend read. You end up cheering for some of the characters and laughing when some fall. All in all it a harmless book and I found it delightful and breezy."
5,laugh out loud,this is the funniest thing ever. Those people who gave it bad reviews are just not getting the satire of it!!!! Definitely a must read.
5,The right address,A book about different types of women's personalities and how they treat other women. Some women were really catty and some just downright cruel!
2,Hit the snooze,"This writer is terrible, 30 preview sample pages is all I need before wasting my money. Her sentences are jumbled and all over the place which makes for a terrible uneven flow. She describes 5 or more characters in 3 pages which has me so confused as who is who..I even tried 'Wolves in chic clothing' and felt the same inexperienced nonsense and hoopla. And describing things just goes on and on, I found myself skipping pages just just to get it overwith. Her books are boring and pointless."
2,It took TWO people to write this book?,It is a snore and bore of a book. I know it is meant to be a farce but it goes too far. I am an average person but have some friends and acquaintances who live in this world. It is not so bad and anyone with any brains could manage it fine. Dull.
3,Average chick lit book,"Ever since I read Marian Keyes ""The Other Side of the Story,"" I have been on a chick lit frenzy. If you are as obsessed with chick lit as I am, then this book is enjoyable...although I didn't love it. The main character, Melanie, is likable but not lovable. She does alot of stupid things and is a total wannabee, which drives me nuts. Like ""knock it off"" girlfriend and quit being so tacky. Show a little sophistication! I liked the way the authors mocked the New York social scene. They created alot of funny fictional charities to show how ridiculous some of these real life black tie events are. It's not about the cause....it's really about who's wearing what and who's sitting at who's table. I'm sure this book pissed off some people."
1,Trashy even for a trash novel,"Yes, this ""gossip novel"" has all been done before so there's nothing new going on here. I recognized descriptions from other books and tv shows (""Seinfield"", ""Sex and the City""). The biggest difference is that this book is the most poorly written, poorly edited piece of garbage I have ever suffered. In particular, the dialogue (no matter the character, their age, or the situation) is written in the same shallow vocabulary of an early 30-something Spence School grad. ""Let's have a contest to see how many exclamation points can be used in one paragraph! OK, great!"" Thankfully, this book was a gift so it wasn't my money wasted in purchasing it...just wasted my time reading it."
3,"Not a Blockbuster, but worth the time","First of all, it's been a while since I've seen the first, so I'mjudging this based on this movie alone. Over all, this is a decentmovie. The acting is decent by most of the cast and it seems to be wellcast. The storyline is surprisingly good. It's easy to follow and afterthe first 30 minutes it will keep you watching. But you have to give itthose 30 minutes to get into it.No, contrary to popular belief Audrina does not have a big part in themovie. She's on screen all of 5 minutes (and that's generous). I haveno idea how that rumor came about.If you want a movie just to watch to kill time, this is that movie. Itwon't wow you but it will keep you entertained as the story really is agood one. I was surprised that it was as good as it is."
2,Hummmmmm.,"I read several other reviews before purchasing, and this is definitely NOT better than the first one. There is some gratuitous nudity that was not needed. At least in the first ""Into the Blue"", the actors could act and there was a tangible chemistry. Not so much in this one. Not one I would recommend watching this unless you get it for free, and even then I wasn't impressed."
2,This Made Me Stop Using Anti-Perspirant and Just Use Deodorant,Perhaps there is something genetic or biological about this but after using anti-perspirants for years and still having sweaty arm pits I tried this product. This did not work either. I then switched to Old Spice Aqua Reef Deodorant (no anti-perspirant) and I no longer have an issue with sweat.This product will leave a residue on the inside of your clothes and at least for me it did not work at all. If you have problems with perspiration I recommend trying to use only a normal deodorant for awhile (get Old Spice Aqua Reef I legit get compliments all the time).
4,performs as expected,"good value for the money, the only con is that the sub-woofer doesn't have a power switch. Thus, you need to either plug the thing into a switched outlet or plug it into a surge suppressor/power strip"
2,"Love me some white tea... this one, not so much!","In my opinion, this tea was a little too dark to be considered white tea. I'm a pretty big tea connoisseur, and I wouldn't buy this particular type/brand again. I'll drink it - so it's not terrible - but definitely not my first choice for white tea!"
2,Never before seen footage?,"The blurb on the box of this movie claims there is ""an abundance of never-before seen footage of Hitler in his private life."" This boast would only be true had you been living on Mars the past thirty years and have never been exposed to a single World War II documentary with scenes of Hitler. Actually, the quality of this production is so paltry the original color home movies of Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun, are shown here in black and white. Some comedown. There are no interviews with former associates of Hitler, nor any Allied opponents. In fact, there is no new or revealing material in this film at all.The narration is also singularly awful. Not only are German names and places horribly misprounounced, but the tinny musical score grates on the nerves after several minutes. Instead of throwing on some opulent and appropriate Wagnerian motive, the producers chose instead to hire a brass band from a local Oktoberfest celebration. Truly a dismal production!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT! 110 CFM Ultra Quiet Heat/Vent/Light/Night Light,"I purchased this model as well as the 80 CFM Ultra Silent Fan/Incandescent Light/Night Light...the smaller 80 CFM has vibration noises with the cover...not sure why or how to fix...I will contact the manufacturer for warranty information...However, the 110 CFM model is unbelievably QUIET!...I have to look at the switch to be sure that it is ON or OFF...very pleased with my purchase...Had a previous older home that had NuTone Heat/Vent/Lights and were still working after 30 years! Love NuTone...you get what you pay for..."
3,Potential but flawed mystic gay novel set in contemporary North England,"The narrative style jarred a little to begin with but improved after the first chapter. This was an easy read, and if implausible at times, the mixture of realism with mysticism worked and made for a mostly enjoyable read. There were moments of interesting drama such as when a homophobic teacher ""outs"" the young 16 year old narrator, Greg. The Jesus/Judas parallel with the two loves of Greg's life Kit and Philippe nearly worked and at least made the novel more interesting but the conclusion was as messy to read as the events it described. Not a book I would recommend for a reading group but there are far worse first gay fiction novels than this one."
5,Great for anyone interested in using writing for healing!!,"I have taught writing for healing for 13 years with a variety of groups (chronic illness and pain, breast cancer,etc.) and Sharon's book explains the basics of writing as a healing tool, gives suggestions for forming a group and includes writing exercises that can be used alone or with others. There is also examples of writing from women in the groups Sharon leads. This is more than a ""how to"" book, Sharon's story and voice make the book an enjoyable read! I highly recommend A Healing Journey."
4,My pet loves it,Even if this doesn't work in the long term my gerbil loves it regardless! I would definitely recommend it. It makes for a happy pet and I am new to this so if it works in the long run it will make for a happy pet owner as well!
2,Too flimsy,"The purpose of this product is to provide a place for your gerbil/hamster to collect it's waste. The top is such light plastic that both gerbils destroyed it like cardboard. I had to throw them away after 1 day. Cute idea, just not appropriate materials for gerbils/hamsters."
2,not stable,"my hamster uses this potty for bathing, he likes to roll in it, but the upper part always comes off because two nicks supposed to hold this upper part easily come out of their holes. second problem is, the litter scatters from the open sides of the potty, these sides need to be a little higher."
2,A good idea in theory.,"In theory, the potty is a great idea. In reality, it needs some tweaks. First of all, the lid makes it too small for a Syrian/Golden hamster (the larger guys). No problem, take off the lid right? Well, the rounded corners of the base make it so the hamster aims its butt at the end of the base, overlapping it and thus peeing OVER the end onto the floor of the cage. If the potty was square and fit flush with the corner of the cage, it would be perfect. Well, at least I can use the little scooper that is included to get into the cage corner and scoop the pee shavings."
4,A quiet workhorse,"I love my at's.My Gefells survived a 10 foot stage dive with these protecting them: they are now my backup pair, after a decade of service.Some will complain about the weight but it is a sure-fire sign of quality and strength.Some will complain about (((noise))) but if you keep things well-dusted it is rare to have any vibration come through while carefully re-positioning. But if you are moving in-session, what truly do you expect?A workhorse indeed, expect 10years plus of service if treated / cared for..."
4,I think it is good,"I started taking another brand of L-Theanine (SunTheanine). I then switched to this brand for the convenience of 200mg capsules and only having to take one at a time. I think my body built up a bit of a tolerance as the overall calming effect doesn't seem as pronounced. Based on the other reviews, and that this is supposedly the authentic SunTheanine formula, I am sure that this product is solid. I'm going to take some time off of all brands of L-Theanine for a while then try again. Was absolutely magical when it was working for me. Very calm, uplifted mood, and not tired."
5,Product is as advertised,"Good stuff.It provided what I wanted. The product was also available at a better cost basis than was available locally.Regards,David A. Siuzdak"
4,L-theanine is a breakthrough amino acid for deeper sleep and raising GABA,L-theanine borders on the miraculous with its no side effect profile and efficacy in raising GABA levels which effect many other neurotransmitter levels indirectly including dopamine and serotonin. Effects start at 200mg but are much more noticeable at 600mg. NOW is a great company but this L-theanine is overpriced.Check out [...] for a great product and much better price/quantity ratio.
2,"You'll say ""I wish I hadn't seen this movie""","It starts out pretty good. Then about half way through, about the time a girl gets her tongue cut off, it gets rather rediculous.Good idea wasted on film. The box says it is 86 minutes...but after awhile you wonder if they meant months..."
5,1950s Jazz At Its Best!,This is a fantastic recording of Art Blakey's seminal 1950s jazz group.The musicianship is superb and the remastered recording sounds like it was made yesterday!Get this along with Volume 1 for a rollicking jazz experience.
5,This vet recommends this,"This is a great cadence compilation to run to. I find it a nice change from music. Also, it takes me back to the days of basic training. It may not be for everyone, but I'd recommend it!!"
3,young child as a scientist,I have not been reading this long but for a uni text book it is very interesting it gives you an idea of how to intergate science into an early childhood setting.
5,Great game for adults and children,Great game Played with 3 couples for dollar bills had a great time you never know who will win and your not out until the last dollar or chip goes in the center.
2,"OK, but!",I have decided to vote with my money regarding customer UNfriendly manufacturing policies. I feel strongly about companies that put stickers on their products that are useless and unsightly to us as users and cannot be removed without making a worse mess. there is some kind of large sku and inventory sticker right on the spine of these black binders that left a mess of adhesive and white partial paper. A penny more spent would pay for removable labels.
3,A little too cheap even for my frugal taste.,"I'm a college student and I constantly need binders for classes, but I wouldn't recommend this one. For the price the quality really doesn't match up. I would have thought this was from the dollar store. Definitely overpriced. I'm still on the hunt for a better one if anyone knows of one!"
3,Bluetooth - H350,Touble getting signal to cell phone at times. Price was right and it feels comfaortably to use.
3,Monster transmitter MBL-FM-XMTR,"Concerned over connectivity, having to reposition the unit while driving to recieve optimum sound. Sometimes it sounds like only half of the tracks are making contact."
5,works great,its a nice transmitter.after this being my second one i can say that the cord itself is weak so after bouncing around your car daily it will last about a year or two.it dosent charge an ipod but i can hook up a laptop or anything with a jack or plug so its awsome.great buy great price
1,What a Monster-ous piece of junk!,"Like others, I was assured by the salesperson at Good Guys that this would enable me to play MP3 music through my car radio. I bought in and then found that here in coastal San Diego, the sound quality with this product is so bad that I wouldn't listen to it if I were paid. What a rip-off!"
2,A lot of Static!,I bought this thinking it would be good and no matter what station I have it on there's always static. It's very annoying. I would not suggest anyone to but this.
1,Sigh..,"Purchased my Monster Cable RadioPlay at Bestbuy in 2006 after I purchased a brand new Ipod. Immediately I was impressed with how simple it was and how the connection and sound quality transmitted. Since I am in my car a lot, I was definitely glad it also charged my Ipod.Within 3 months of having it, it stopped charging my Ipod. It still works three years later, plays music great but won't charge my ipod. I had tried to return it to BestBuy, contacted the manufacturer and they suggested I purchase a new one and offered to mail me a 15% off coupon. Wow.. crock of...Either way, if you're looking for a dependable car adapter this would be it, just don't forget to charge it before you leave, or expect to use your ipod over a road trip without bringing a wall charger or a laptop to plug the feckin thing in. :("
3,Nat King Cole,Note!!This cd has been issued two times using the same upc code. This issue has 28 titles.Cd title is NAT KING COLE...Ask seller which copy does he or she have for sale...
1,Dissapointing,"Music is very dissapointing, the other reviews must of been written by family members. I played Will You Married me to my wife before I proposed and she kicked me in the nads and I have never seen her again. I will go to a Schwamm concert just to find him and rip him a new one."
1,Doesn't fit,The description and the box say this is for 7900 series phones but it doesn't fit our 7936. Additionally it's not a Cisco product it's a Delta Electronics product. Misleading advertising.
5,I love being a turtle!,"Classic movie, classic CD. It just shows the fun of the early 90's. And I don't understand why this film was so bashed. My favorite Song: Tarzan Boy."
3,not bad some good mixees,not my favorite of the cd's but none the less its pretty good. i can't stop rocking to it.
4,the great mahler,a great composer with a great team of artists! it's great music and entertainment! messias
4,Tommy Lee - Who Knew,"Well looky what Tommy Lee has been up too. While the rest of the Crue have been resting on their laurels it looks like Tommy has finally gotten it togethor. After his disaster with Methods of Mayhem he turns around and comes out with Never A Dull Moment.If your looking for ol school Crue look elsewhere but if your like me, an old crusty rock guy who's taste have expanded and matured since the days of Shout at the Devil then you will appreciate NADM. I could do with less electronica but when he rocks he does it good. Well except with the cover of David Bowies Fame...never was a fave song of mine to begin with .Overall a good albumn that can be listened to from begining to end. Tommy does a good job of keeping up with the new while staying true to the old.And who knew the guy can actually sing pretty damn good in my opinion. I would like to see Tommy get more airplay and support,I think he has finally earned it."
1,let me explain,this guy sucks because he`s phony.shout at the devil was good though and crue album with carobi thats it.method was just him trying to cash in on the korn explosion . now he`s trying to cash in on the guy who singlehandly stomped hair bands out. YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHT
1,Ok Wake up People,Tommy Lee was cool up till he left Motley Cure and quit being excusivly a drummer. Tommy Lee is so overrated he may be able to write songs but the problem is they are about his mitakes by going into rehab. I dont want to spend money to listen to a overpaid musican cry about his problems. Maybe if he would have not gone wanna be rapper he would be cool. Memo to Tommy DONT EVER PUT OUT ANOTHER HORRIBLE PIECE OF MUSIC LIKE THIS AGAIN. I wish I could give this waste of plastic no stars
5,"Recipes that ""rock""!","Food writer and former professional baker and magazine editor Margie Lepanja and teamed up with Cindy Coverdale (wife of David Coverdale, lead singer of Whitesnake, Deep Purple, and Coverdale Page) to issue a unique cookbook that showcases musician owned restaurants, musical cookbooks and songs about food, chefs who perform as well on stage as they do in the kitchen, and recipes that ""rock""!

Enhanced with ""Players' Hot Links"" websites and ""Hospitality Suite"" acknowledgements, Food That Rocks is an enthusiastically recommended cookbook."
5,PERFECT,I love the sound of music and for a long time now i have been wanting a sound of music poster. well i finally broke down and bought this one. its better then i ever could have imagined! the colors are vibrate and the print is well done. also the price was right for me. i would definatly order from movie poster planet if i ever need another poster
1,CRAP!!! CRAP!!! CRAP!!!,I bought these cables and they look great and appear to be of fine quality.....DONT BE FOOLED! They are ok I suppose IF YOU NEVER PLAN TO UNPLUG THEM! When trying to unplug the cable from my HDTV the supposed gold prong stays suck in the tv whilst the cable comes out with these frayed gold conecters that are impossible to salvage. The conecter is held together by a tiny dot of metal sauter and pops apart like a rubberband. I bought them through Amazon from ANT OLINE...BEWARE of this company I have been trying to get a hold of them for a week and they refuse to answer my emails...Amazon wont replace them because they were from one of thier vendors not them. I have to go through some A-Z guarantee which I have yet to have time to hassle with. I wont order from third parties on AMAZON...always a NIGHTMARE....stick with AMAZON products only and perhaps you will safe. DONT BUY THESE CABLES.
4,very good ping pong net,"This is a very good, inexpensive net that works well. Be aware that the net overhangs the table, and the brackets connect to the table several inches inside the end of the net. That means that the length of the net does not tell you how far apart the brackets connect to the table. Subtract several inches from the length of the net to get the length of how far apart the brackets connect to the table. If you have an older massive table, like I do, you may have to cut a notch in the table to get the brackets to connect. It was worth the small hassle for the price of this net. For most folks, this net is proabably a perfect size. There is also a string that you tighten to add tension to the top of the net."
4,An Underrated Comedy,"I didn't expect a lot from Rules of Engagement -- David Spade plus a couple of couples in different stages of their lives .... yeah, yeah.But I found myself laughing a lot. Spade is used perfectly, which is to say, not too much. But the real revelation is Patrick Warburton, aka Puddy from Seinfeld. He plays the primitive, for sure, but finds a way to make his character appealing enough for us to understand why his witty wife (Megyn Price) sticks around.Oliver Hudson is cute, for sure. I want more from him, something like the magic his sister Kate made in Almost Famous. I'm willing to keep checking in with the show to see if he delivers."
5,steves review,i am very happy with this product and its availability. i am also very happy with the promptness in witch it was delivered. thank you and great job to everyone involved
5,Love it,"Love this original soundtrack. really enjoyed listening to anna kendrick as a young girl in this, in which she was tony nominated"
5,Simply awesome!,"I got this album on the whim, and I swear I couldn't have made a better choice. It IS just video game music but totally different and real. Very nostagolic of course but there's definitely more, it has staying power. I hope to see more work from The Advantage!"
5,Sick Old School Gamer Music,"By far, this is the best Video-game cover band on the planet! The Advantage makes these old school Nintendo songs turn into gold plated dippers! I listen to this all the time when I'm going for a walk or run and it's just awesome to hear classics done by an amazing rock band. I especially love the Megaman songs!"
3,Swing Low,"Don't expect to be blown away. This is an ok mainstream album recorded by working musicians, I respect them, but their music just doesn't reach any heigths."
3,spooky tramples on already broken ground,"The god of the turntable, the intellectual genius of the underground finds himself in a holding pattern here. As always, this is great listening, but it does not provide the aural challenge of The Freight Elevator Quartet disc, nor does it rock the joint like Riddim Warfare. Enjoy but don't expect too much."
2,Inconsistant and to read,Turing on the scale with a tap of the foot often results in an error or low battery signal. Have to do it a few times to get it to start properly. Scale is difficult to read (no way at night) as there is no backlight. Weight is accurate and for the price not a bad unit.
1,don't buy this scale!!!,"I briefly checked amazon reviews before I bought this - thinking that this would be a good enough scale. The biggest mistake I made was that I didn't check all the reviews. Apparently only good ones show up at the product page. It was a ok product when I got it in the mail. However, after a week of use, it only shows err when you step on it. what a waste of money...."
4,CD Player wouldn't read 1st CD,"The first CD of the 4-CD set wouldn't read in my car radio, so I started with #2. This book came highly recommended, and I drive so much I thought I'd try a book on tape. It is in fact a really great book (so far), and it's nice to have it read by the people who actually wrote the book...it's very hard to misinterpret anything in the book. I think I will have to buy the print version though...I find it a little hard to really absorb what's being said while driving."
4,Good Crash course,This is a good book to get conversation started. It is not meant to be a replacement for marriage counseling but rather a supplement to it.I found it to be a bit over simplified in a number of ways. Each chapter lightly touches on huge issues in marriage. Books and books have been written on each subject that is talked about here. So I would say that this is a good crash course for people about to get married. Though it does do a very good job dispelling many of the myths a lot of people bring into marriage.
2,"Great design, yet poor quality","It looks great and feels great, with simulated leather between areas of rubber where the glittery dragons are. However, when I first put this on my wheel, the simulated leather portion was torn and ripped. This could be because I left this portion to be the last to slip on, so it had to undergo the most stress. Be careful when you install, I recommend leaving the rubbber, dragon area to be slipped on last as it may be better suited to handle the tight fit."
1,Warning- product may contain chemicals and lead...,"The steering wheel cover actually has a warning on the back that says""WARNING: This product contain chemicals, including lead, known to the state of California to cause cancer and/or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling this product.""Enough said."
5,Gorgeous,"I've been in love with Tomie de Paola's work since I first read Stregenona. When I was searching for bibles and story books about Jesus for my son, I found this book of bible stories by Tomie de Paola and was really excited. My husband was worried the stories wouldn't be accurate, but as we read the book we were pleasantly surprised by the accurate telling of the stories of this bible paired with the gorgeous illustrations of Tomie de Paola. Great story book, I'd love to have a hardcover version. Timeless, classic, and a wonderful addition to any and every children's library."
4,Comprehensive medical resource,"I recently purchased the Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide and have found it to be informative and easy to use. The book fulfills our need for a quick reference book on ailments and treatments. This book is priced less expensively than some of the other medical books available. It provides good value for the cost. I recommend it to individuals looking for a comprehensive, informative, easy to read, home health guide."
4,Komaroff is an excellent physician; Good comprehensive guide,"Komaroff is a great physician, researcher and academic. That said, I was a bit disappointed with the entry on ME/CFIDS, which is a specialty of his. It is much better than some other texts but does not highlight enough the dangers of exercise and the inefficacy of the type of CBT often prescribed. More information on the phsyiological basis of the disease would be nice."
4,Overall - great buy!,"The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is that the velcro has scraped up my arm when I have worn this higher on my arm. Now that I wear it closer to my elbow, the strap does not bother me. I love the armband though...makes running with my Inno a breeze!"
5,Perfect carrier for my XMP3,Even though the description of this product says it fits the inno and helix I took a chance and bought it for my Pioneer XMP3 device. I noticed the inno was about the same size as the XMP3 and sure enough fits perfect. Very pleased. A must for anyone who will travel with this sort of device.
2,Very Dull.....,"Scaasi has dressed and designed for some of the most fascinating women of the past and present, and this is the best book he can write? Dull from start to finish; only the chapters on Streisand and Laura Bush show a little bit of life. Avoid."
1,"Don't ""waist"" your money","If you want to screw up your metabolism with more dieting nonsense then this is for you. Otherwise don't waste your money. Think about it. Off and on, isn't that what we already do? I won't be doing this again. Want mine?"
4,a good shred-fest,"This CD is an amazing display of guitar technique, although the fretboard gymanstics sometimes make it a bit hard to listen to. It's certainly worth checking out although you have to be in the right mood."
4,"The Name Says It All ""WOW!""","I have Wow '97,'98, and Wow- Praise and Worship. I plan to have this one as well. It doesn't suprize me the I want to hear more !"
4,READ THIS --K?,"This was my first christian c.d. I am really glad i bought it because its such a wide variety of bands it helps you to know what bands you like. This is especially helpful if you are just starting out a christian music collection. N-E ways the songs are really good and there is one for every mood your in. Don't let the price scare you cause you get a ton of great music, and remember it is two c.d's. So be sure to consider this and at least put it on your wish list"
4,Music with a powerful message,"An excellent two cd set. I bought this over ten years ago and still love the music. The special song (song 17 on the silver disc) ""Friend of Mine(Columbine)"" still gets to me after all this time. Oh, and the track listing for the silver disc on Amazon here is incorrect. The actual track listing is as follows1. Speechless - Steven Curtis Chapman2. Takes a Little Time - Amy Grant3. I will be your friend - Michael W. Smith4. Show you love - Jaci Velasquez5. Can't live a day - Avalon6. Breathe - Sixpence none the richer7. Saving Grace - Point of Grace8. Run to You - Twila Paris9. Revive Us - Anointed10. It's Alright - Winans Phase 211. I will Follow Christ - Clay Crosse Featuring Bebe Winans and Bob Carlisle12. One of the these Days - FFH13. Omega - Rebecca St. James14. For the Glory of your Name - Michelle Tumes15. Cartoons - Chris Rice16. I Am - Jill Phillips17. Friend of Mine(Columbine) - Jonathan and Stephen Cohen"
3,Vintage Peter Mayle? Non!,"For the most part, Peter Mayle's books have distinguished themselves because of their apt and charming descriptions of the cultural idiosyncrasies of small-town Provence. Mayle's primary and secondary characters were full-bodied -- people whom could easily visualize and with whom you could empathize. The Provencal countryside and markets were alive and stimulated your palate.In comparison with his earlier works, Mayle's latest endeavor falls flat! The characterizations are shallow, the plot simplistic, and the spirit of the Luberon is not much in evidence. In ""A Year in Provence"" and ""Toujours Provence"" you could feel the physical impact of the Mistral's battering winds. While breezy, ""A Great Year"" has none of the full-fledged richness of his earlier works."
4,A Good Year is a good book.,"Well written and moves along nicely, if you purchase this book as a stand alone read it's worth the money.Don't watch the movie and think the book will be the same with a deeper storyline, it isn't. May of the characters are the same, but the entire chain of events differs.I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so that's all I'll say on the matter.A good book."
1,Absolute rubbish.,"This movie was an insult to Romero and the genre itself. The acting was dull, and completely amateur. The special effects were on par with a bad rubber halloween mask. The writing was uninspired, and absolutely amateur and juvenile as well, and the 3d effects are almost non existant and when they are used are poorly done and sometimes ridiculous (oooooh, 3d joint smoke, WOW!)This isnt even scifi channel calibur, this is simply insulting and a very feeble attempt at filmmaking. It isn't even bad in a good way, it's JUST bad.This film should have never been made and thier ""poster boy"" Sid Haig falls just as flat as the rest.This is first day film school bad. This is ""maybe directing isn't your thing. Howabout a job at the bowling alley"" bad.Purchase at your own risk."
1,"Can not say ""awful"" enough","I have seen an incredible amount of horror movies in my day and this one was, without a doubt, one of the worst. The only reason I watched it all the way through was because it was a gift and the person who gave it to me was watching it with me. The 3D effects were laughable and I still don't know why they even bothered with the *3D* label. The only *bright* spot was Sid Haig and even with him, it was still dreadful. The storyline was awful (I know, I know, how many different ways can one do a zombie movie?), the 3D effects were awful, the entire movie was unbelievably awful. Do not waste your money or your time on this and coming from me, that's saying a lot."
3,not as bad as the others said it was,"I agree with the others that it was not as good as the original movie. The 3D on the video ""night of the living dead"" was good, however I must worn you "" do not try to clean the glasses"" they will smeat and the blue of the blue lense will come off."
3,Good Fun great accessories,Pluses:The 3D glasses are a real plus and make the product worthwhile. Makes for good movie night get together. Good fun for a low budget horror that incorporates the original flick into the plot. Interesting soundtrack.Minuses:There are some holes and loose ends and the final scene feels truncated.
1,"embarrasment to a classic cult film George A. Romeros ""Night of the living Dead""","I think this movie is a waste of time and money to watch!!!! I love George A. Romeros original and Tom Savinis remake there is no way they could have made those movies any better. So the 3D wasn't good, and the acting was absolutely horrible, just trying to make an xtra buck on a great movie. There are some remakes that make me go ""WOW"" the director really new what he was doing, this remake made me think ""WOW"" this director couldn't have picked a worst cast/actors. The acting was off through out the whole movie, the zombies where trying to hard act like zombies but the only thing I could say about the zombies was they looked like zombies should look, ""Great Job"" Makeup Artist... as for that don't waste you time/money."
2,"Great idead, but crapy movie","Night of the Living Dead 3D is a great idead, but lacks a lot of elements that the original had. The acting in this film was just so so, and the horror wasn't even scary, like the 1968 version by Gearorge A. Romero. Instead they put in too much talking and profanity that just wasn't useful. Godd try, but didn't succeed."
4,good book,"Great book but certainly not worth the $ [money].Why is that, you ask?BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE BOOK YOU CAN FIND ON THE AUTHOR'S WEBSITE!!!!!!!I ordered this book expecting to find out stuff that wasn't on the website..."
