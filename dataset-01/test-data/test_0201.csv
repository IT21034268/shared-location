1,Not a 32mm chain roller,"This comes in a plastic package. On the front of the package, in huge bold letters, it says ""34mm chain roller."" Also only has a bearing on one side, which pops out."
5,Great Service!,"The product arrived to me so quickly after ordering, the book is also in great condition!"
5,Aptly titled,"This set of CDs has been a great help to me in uncovering the causes of depression for me. I bought it years ago and still listen to it from time to time.Pema Chodron is good-humored, down-to-earth, and gentle, but also profoundly insightful. She really helps us to recognize that much of our suffering is self-inflicted because we repeatedly allow things to ""get to us,"" but we can unlearn that unhealthy way of reacting to irritants in our lives."
4,Review,Well written book with interesting tone that (intentionally) stops short of full Waugh-like satire. Definitely worth a read.
3,"A Simple, Engaging Tale","A simple but mildly engaging tale of a King who attempts to bring the moon to his sick-at-heart young daughter, the princess. The moral seems to be that smart people only tend to see the big, obvious approaches to life, whereas commoners (here it's the court jester) can better grasp the subtleties associated with outlandish wishes and have the ability to make them come true without getting mired in all the ""science"" of the matter. Dreams can come true everyday, it just takes a little bit of imagination and determination to see them realized. The drawings are a bit scraggly and odd -- I'm surprised Thurber didn't illustrate it himself -- but I like the way they border the text on certain pages and bring some flair to the story. Originally published in 1943."
3,Decent story.,"Illustrations are sketched and mostly pastel colors are utiilized. After reading each detailed page, the pictures don't seem to do much for the imagination. Good ideas are behind the words, but this book is extremely wordy at times and could've been shortened while still making the same point known. I enjoyed how the King, who was in search for the moon for his sick daughter, continued to ask his smartest men to figure out a way to get his daughter the moon only to find out that the court jester was the wittiest of them all. The daughter helps solve her own problem without realizing it and comes to a wonderful conclusion about how she can have the moon in her hand and also see it in the sky."
2,Mediocre at Best,"This guide does not include half the details I was looking for. It lacks on historical background, demographics, maps, neighborhood information and totally leaves out several cities. It lacks major cities in the details that it does cover. I had high expectations, and was left very dissapointed. I felt this guide was mediocre at best."
1,Worst of Linda Howard,"This must be the earliest book penned by Linda Howard. The characters are so immature. The heroine does not deserve to be called hero, the best she can do is crying for no apparent reason. I absolutely agree to the previous reviewer, this book is not worth buying. If you are Linda Howard's fanatic reader and do not want to miss even one of her book, just borrow this book, DO NOT BUY ! All The MacKenzie books, Heart a Fire, After the Night and Dream Man are highly recommended for all Linda Howard's first reader."
1,Quit republishing Howard's early works!,"This book does not, in any way, reflect the talents of Ms. Howard! It is probably her worst effort, although I realize she was publishing to the ""requirements"" of the time. Niko is a boor, and our heroine is milchtoast! UGH!"
4,I very much enjoyed this book.,"Wow, this was my first Linda Howard book, and already I am searching for others. The descriptive technique of the author was wonderful. I could visualize the location and almost the characters faces. I also enjoyed the relationship that grew quickly between Nikolas's mother and Jessica. The out of control sex was exciting. I will have to be more careful when i listen to books like this at work.(giggling)"
3,Good for teachers,"While this video has clear views of the dancers feet all the explanation of the steps is in choreographers language. No attention is given to posture or position and the teacher inexplicably uses more then one term for several steps. As a teacher I can translate the steps into beginners language, but this video is not for beginners."
1,Choppy writing and non-existent transitions.,"Three Moons Rising has an acceptable premise, but is very poorly executed. Never mind the over-abundance of commas and lousy grammar -- concentrate on the storytelling itself -- that says it all. The author lets the reader in on every character's thought, and beyond -- what's more commonly known as head-hopping. VERY annoying. Choppy sentences and non-existent transitions continually pull the reader out of the story."
5,Intense and smart,"This is the best ""metal"" CD of 2003. I quote ""metal"" because that's what it's closest to, but this incorporates all the best of heavy music from punk to death to grind to melodic. These guys know what they are doing - again! The first 2 CD's were just as pummeling and smart. I'll be at the store when/if they release anything else. I've heard about a DVD, but don't see it here. No dissapointment here."
5,Pure American Death Metal,"This album kills. I think its an improvement over New American Gospel, which is saying a lot. I first heard LOG on the Danny Way DC commercial and from that 15 second snippet I had to track these guys down. The song Pariah from New American Gospel is used in that commerical, but I couldn't find a copy of New American Gospel so I picked up As The Palaces Burn. OMFG, I was dropped to the floor. This album is killer. I'd consider it death metal, but its actually good :-) I like some death metal but only when there's some real song structure and not just blast beat wanking. If you like heavy, and I do mean heavy, metal, pick up this album you will not be disappointed."
2,This book made me fall asleep!,If you love fast pace novels do not buy this book! If you are the kind of person who likes books that are slow paced and day to day events you will like the book. At first I thought itwould be good since this little girl can see images of another little boy and all that happens to him. Boy but was I wrong! There is no excitment sure there's strong love but nothing to entertain you. The only thing I liked was that this book involved a couple from the book My Beloved. I wish I had not bought the book. But that is just my opinion.
3,"A hit or a miss, this one is a MISS","Her books are usually GREAT or kinda flat and this one, unfortunately, is pretty flat. I won't rehash the plot, since several people have already done so.The concept of this story, dreaming of your soul mate and actually meeting that person seemed quite romantic and Ms Ranney does show this quite spectacularly in the beginning of the book, however as I noticed with her other ""miss"" books, its mucked down with way too much internalization that will put you to sleep.For most people, I am sure this will be one of those books you will find yourself skipping around, trying to get to the important parts... will there aren't any. Nothing really happens, just lots of internal monologue, inner thoughts.... did I mention nothing really happens?....3 stars rating from me because she does write beautifully, but ""sometimes"" it can get very dull.."
5,This book is GREAT,The doom series of books is one of the best sci-fi series i've read in a long time ( and i've read ALOT!) A must read. ( and the sooner there is a fifth book the better.
3,Should have been better.,"This book was okay, but not nearly as good as the first...That and the new characters are rather boring...stereotypes. The only advantage this book has over Knee Deep in the Dead is the addition of the new stuff from the Doom 2 game. All of the wonder and fear is removed and replaced with pointless talking. Overall, read it only because you need it to fill in the plot for books 3 and 4."
3,"Not as good as the first, but not bad overall","The sequel to Knee-Deep in the Dead is not as engrossing asthe first, but if you read the first book, you _must_ readthis one as well. It adds two new characters to the team, a Mormon sniper and a 14-yr old computer whiz. It includes some exciting battles on a train, in buildings, and in an airliner. However, the viewpoint changes from one character to the next, and while some may like that, I personally find it annoying, and occasionally confusing. A must read if you're dying to find out how Fly and Arlene get back to Earthside.."
3,Fans Deee-Lite: LADY MISS KIER sings on two tracks!!,"This is average D&B, but...FANS OF DEEE-LITE should rejoice and buy this CD since it features TWO, yup, count 'em, TWO amazing vocal tracks by one ""Violet"" AKA LADY MISS KIER - not sure why she used this psuedonym (Kier spent last year touring as alter ego Violet?!), but both these songs BACK TO THE BOOGIE and UP ON LIFE are choice Deee-Lite-esque workouts that bode well for Kier's years-in-the-making alleged solo career - when oh when will Ms. Kier get off her collective a** and finally grace us with a full-length solo debut CD - it's really a shame, and I don't know why she doesn't have a record deal? Oh well, get this pronto!"
4,Short-lived fun,Decent album with some catchy tunes. Theres a bit of Pixies with some Dandy Warhol in there. Sadly it's pretty short but it does leave you wanting more.
5,"Guidance for managers, educators, and students alike!","Book written to be easily read by adults and students. Love the context and the teamwork tips that have been incorporated. Read with your coworkers, or with your class of students when wanting to build teamwork skills."
1,Poor warranty support,I have had problems with my Aquos on and off for a year. At first Sharp was very helpful but now they are not very interested in fixing my problem. Their authorized repair centers are very busy and I am apparently a low priority.
3,Lots of information,Only a few pages of this vast volume applied to what I was searching for. This is designed more a watch repairman than for the average person looking for information.
1,incomplete guide to watches,"There is nothing complete about it , it really is a beginners guide to watch origins."
1,Not that Helpful,"The book didn't have any details I was looking for, it was not possible to know that until you bought it. Obviously a waste of money for me."
2,Not worth being published once a year,"I am an old time collector and have had my share of excellent watches. NAWCC # 29290. This book was a welcome addition to my library at the beginning but it has become a yearly event and not as welcome as the Capistrano's swallows.A little tweaking here and there, a slight increase in price, a few new watches pictures and... A La Kazam ! A new edition is born. It is a good source of informations but I think once every 5 years would be sufficient. The prices DO NOT reflect the real world prices and eBay prices give a better idea. I have seen watches in this book listed at 1000 dollars in mint condition go on eBay in the same condition for 300 and vice versa. The authors also run a very active watch business and the book is self serving. Once every 5 years would be very sufficient."
5,One of the best price guide book,Interesting and informative. Using it as a guide for my daily sales and purchase. Highly recommend.
1,Very disappointed,"Just purchased the 2009 edition and upon checking several of my favorite pocketwatches' prices, I saw no change from 2008 (hard to imagine). Curiously, I checked the prices of gold watch cases and found these lazy people used some ancient gold price of $650 per ounce. I was very unhappy and disappointed to get taken on this purchase. They put in very little effort each year and still charge big bucks for their product. I have been a watch collector and member of NAWCC since 1971. I am 59 years old and I WILL NEVER BUY ONE OF THEIR BOOKS AGAIN. Shame on the authors.Amaqzon was great! Quick, free shipping."
2,truth in advertising?,"There's an old adage, ""He who has the gold, makes the rules.""A point that no one who has reviewed this book has proffered, is that Shugart OWNS the business that publishes his book and price listings as well as buys, sells, and trades vintage watches that are listed in his 'Price Guide'. As a serious collector, things like overall condition for watch cases, dials, movements, etc. are, in my experience, VERY subjective, whether he defines the parameters or not. Just ask anyone who has purchased a vintage watch on Ebay and returned it because the condition was not as it was described. As for new price listings, I have to take their word that there are, I believe they claim, '10,000' new prices for the 2003 edition. But, are these prices based upon a true market value, or some nebulous value that Shugart's elected to publish?"
3,A book in search of an editor....,"This book is very helpful and valuable. I have already made back the purchase price by using the pricing guidelines. But there are no indexes, the watches are listed in no particular order, and much information is omitted or incomplete. Additionally, there are no signs of editing. Entire paragraphs are repeated, sentences are duplicated, words are misspelled. While this does not have any direct effect on the quality of the catalog features of the book, it is mighty distracting."
1,I have never seen,so many errors in one book. the watches are highly under valued.the only good thing is that you can use the book as reference to rip sellers of.
5,Fantastic Savings and Works with Digital TV!,"This product saved me at least $200 in cable tech charges to route a coax cable to a TV I needed to hookup without having exposed coaxial cable. If I had to use the old style larger diameter cable it would have not been a possible situation. The routing included going under some trim and near a door wall that had an approach near a tile floor entry. I simply ran the thin cable along a slight groove I made on the edge of the tile and then under the wood trim to the TV. I had a cable tech tell me that this thin coax would not provide enough signal strength for digital TV. I saw a couple of the reviews that conflicted this fact, but I ordered the $8.25 cable anyway just to see if it would provide the signal for a small TV in the kitchen. No problem.........I can see when this might not provide signal for a HD channel, but for my purposes it was a perfect solution."
5,"Nice cable, works fine","In my new house, the TV is across the room from where the cable comes in. Eventually I'll get down in the crawlspace and run a cable under the floor, but I don't want to do that right now while we're still getting settled. This cable is thin enough to run under my area rug where it's out of sight. People will be stepping on it (through the rug) so I don't expect it to last forever, but it will do the job until I get a more permanent solution in place. Ends are solid and the cable as a whole looks well-made. Works great with my digital cable, on-demand HD programming comes through just as quickly & smoothly as with a thick cable so the data rate does not appear to be affected (at least not enough to matter).If I had a layout where I could run this cable under the baseboard to the outlet, I would not hesitate to use it as a permanent solution."
5,Good cable,No problems with digital cable and premium channels. Nice and thin for under my carpet. Will buy again when I need one.
4,Great Memories!!,"This is clearly the best film of the genre, and nobody was better than Sho Kosugi!! The story is typical but solid, and the acting is not oscar worthy, but it works with the film. Great to see it on DVD, too. I hadn't seen it in almost 20 years until recently, and it gave me chills watching it again!"
3,Mixed thoughts,This movie was ok. There were some clever attacks and some what cool battles for its time. But I expected more.
1,This order was not received,I chose this rating because I did not get my DVD. I ordered it for my son for Christmas along with several other Ninja movies. The other DVD's came as promised in excellent condition. I would like to get the DVD I paid for.
1,Worm like man just goes with being weird...details @ 11:00!!!!!!!,"There is something peculiar about this wormy musician. Perhaps it's his baritone voice splattered all over the plastic world of '80s pop; perhaps it's because he wrote and produced Weezer's best record (the blue album); perhaps it's because he inexplicably dates supermodels.Whatever the case may entail, this wormy idiot wasted his time with the Cars, and wasted his time in music. The fool!!! He could have been in Star Trek, by far the most clever, cool, most hip space show since Battle Star Galactica in the '70s!!!! Just think, America's catch phrase could have been, ""Beam me up, Ricky!"" Instead we got California Raisins, ""Where's the Beef"" and a local Hemingdorm that doesn't even serve biscuits and gravy during breakfast hours...the horror!!!!YOUR TIME IS APRECIATED!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,yo Pat,"if you are into promise ring, grade, boy sets fire, or any other emocore bands, you'll probably like this cd, or if you havent heard of the band, you'll probably like them.the whole cd is good, and worth buying.i wouldn't rate it 5 stars if it wasn't 5 stars."
4,Stiff toy,My son bought this for himself and was a little disappointed that it didn't move at all. He still loves to play with it though. Cool looking toy for the price.
2,Horrible New Layout,"I don't know why they changed from the old layout to the new skinny vertical columns. The old planner was a lifesaver, but this new layout is unusable. They claim to be the artist's notebook, but what artist is really going to be breaking their day down hour by hour? And even if someone wanted to do that, the tiny columns are worthless. Really a shame."
1,ACT 2005 Disaster,"Being a user of ACT since 1990, I thought I would continue to upgrade as I have in the past. What a mistake. 6.0 (was no IS) a good product. 2005 has a long way to go.I would like everyone to know when you transfer your 6.0 database to 2005 there is no way to revert back to 6.0 and bring your notes with.What a joke."
1,"Good Software, HORRIBLE SUPPORT FROM COMPANY","I purchased this software as a longtime user of ACT. I used ACT 2000, Act 6.0 and now have upgraded. Not only did I have a ton of problems with installing the software but the first update Best Software released, completely annihilated my machine and erased my existing database. I had to wait for over 2 hours for support. Thank goodness this problem happened within 30 of originally installing the program with otherwise they would have charge me $300 to by a support package so they could help me to fix a mistake of THEIR update. The program is good once it is up and running however my customer database is the lifeblood of my business. I will not trust this company and their apparent gross negligence to quality control, as well as their disregard for supporting the very products they release for general sale. If your business depends on a solid customer database program, don't look at this company to fit the bill!"
1,Long-winded and boring,"This is a very verbose and boring presentation of evidence for evolution. Dawkins either, must have been paid per word, or is so full of himself that he can't help but pontificate - on and on and on.....He uses 20 - 100 pages to explain what could more easily be understood and absorbed in one. It is unfortunate for science that Dawkins is one of the spokespersons for evolution, as the very people who would benefit from learning of the evidence (for evolution) that he presents, would never be able to endure the boredom this rambling book engenders."
2,A Hard Read,Reading this book is so difficult and so hard going that I put it down after 2 chapters and filed it in the section of my library that gathers dust. I understand what he is trying to say but he says it in a very dry and uninteresting way. I have read some of his other books that are most interesting but this one just doesn't work for me.
4,New is not necessarily bad,"This album got a lot of bashing, mostly in comparison to previous work done by the band. All in all, it is a very toned down affair with two rockers. Jim's attempt at singing is a novelty, fun for a while, and thankfully limited to one track. But hey, we all slow down at some point. This was a prelude--a transition--from ""Loved"" to ""Future Songs,"" and not a bad one at that."
4,great c.d,"i thought this was a great c.d. the reason i got it though was cause the store sold out of pearl jam's single last kiss. but when the lady gave me no boundaries it seemed better then getting the single. cause it has korn, rage against the machine, bush, and 2 pearl jam songs. i think it's great that there is such good music on a c.d that's going to a good cause"
5,Duke's Magnum Opus,"This CD contains Duke's last interpretation of his masterpiece, Black, Brown, and Beige. This is the only known recording of practically the entire work that has great sound quality (the Carnegie Hall concert of 1943 was very poorly recorded). And unlike the 1958 recording of BBB with Mahalia Jackson (which actually only consisted of the ""Black"" section of the piece), Johnny Hodges is present at this session and his rendition of ""Come Sunday"" is worth the price of the entire CD. This music is pure spirituality through and through. Renditions of Harlem and Ad Lib on Nippon are simply an added bonus to an amazing album. Highly recommended essential Ellington."
3,"Great Audio Quality, So So Story","I found the audio quality of this audio book to be outstanding. Quite possibly the best I've ever experienced. With that said, however, I found the story less than compelling. Same old paranormal thriller (urban fantasy?) that I've read before, only better. Jim Butcher, for example, writes Patricia Briggs off the page. Nevertheless, we have another wolf story with a sort of Buffy clone, and well, you get the idea. I suppose if you are a Patricia Briggs fan, you should jump at this just for the pleasant experience of listening. For myself, I found my mind wandering all too often..."
4,Classic Patricia Briggs with an update,"I never read the story in it's original form, so I can't compare it, but I thoroughly enjoyed the re-release. It really doesn't read like an early novel, and the quality of characterization and world-building is comparable to her current work. I was sad that is part one of a duology, because there's enough good stuff here to set up a series. If you like epic style fantasy, with mercenaries and sorcerers, that's told on a more personal scale, then this is a great book to try. The direct sequel,Wolfsbane (Aralorn)is also quite good. Related books,When Demons Walk (Sianim)andSteal the Dragon (Sianim, No. 2)are also worth reading."
5,The continuation of trust,I would recommend this book and its continued story lines to anyone who has ever loved a wolf or Alpha dog. The friendship and loyalty of such creatures when shared is totally immersing. It is worth the money and your time to read.
3,What Did Then 7-yr Old Yaffa Eliach Personally Know?,"There is an ongoing controversy about this book. Was her family killed by the Polish underground, with her the only lucky survivor, because they were Jewish or because they were Communists? The Poles have documentary evidence to support their case. And those who have followed Eliach's claims over the years allege that Eliach has changed her story a number of times. As for her personal experience, one wonders how the then 7-yr old Eliach could determine what the motives of her killers were anyway. Not too many 7 yr olds can make such judgements, and so Eliach's opinion, as the adult author of this book, can only rest solely on extraneous Polonophobic sources. As for Polish collaboration with the Nazis, Winston Churchill praised the Poles for being the only European nation not to produce a Quisling. Was he a victim of propaganda for making this statement?"
4,An interesting overview of the Middle-East,"This book gives an interesting background to much of the modern attitudes of the middle-east and their historical basis. It explains how traditonaly society in the middle east has based itself around family/clan ties then religion and then state last of all.In fact the concept of people belonging to and owning loyalty to a state is quite new to the region in many places as they don't have the long history of it that Europe has. It also explains how long standing traditions within holy law govern such things at the correct treatment of non-muslim minorities (in theory).If you really don't know much about middle eastern and arab culture this book is a good introduction, to a society that is in many ways fundimentaly alien to western culture.It should be noted that this book is ONLY an introduction and in many ways has a lot of generalisations, but it's a good starting point if you don't know much about arab culture (like me)."
5,Altamente recomendable,"El lector queda atrapado por esta obra autobiográfica del joven aventurero que se come al mundo.Un homenaje a una mujer y a los hombres que la rodean, con una trama excelentemente manejada, ambientada tanto en la Patagonia como en Europa y hasta África.Solo tiene un error de fecha en la pagina 215 pero es pecata minuta.El final es EXCELENTE."
1,Horrible taste,"I am a regular consumer of Boost and Ensure, and I thought I would try this one. I could barely go past a few sips. I am throwing the rest of the stuff away."
5,Best Taste in a Carton,"Muscle Milk is well known for being one of the most tasty protien powders, these vanilla cartons are no different. The previous reviewer is way off base, this product is not comparable to ""Ensure""."
1,Sacks is his own worst subject,"Dr Sacks' books are generally brilliant looks at this neurologist's patients and their ailments. Individual cases are presented clearly and succinctly and understandably for the layman. When he writes about himself, at least in this instance, he loses his way. I read somewhere that for this book Dr Sacks submitted well over 200,000 words to the publisher and a cadre of editors pared away two thirds of the content. What remains is tedious. With an enormously dramatic event (Dr Sacks attacked and mauled by a bull on a remote mountainside) and neurological complications as intriguing as any others he has written about, you would expect a riveting volume. Not at all. Use this book as a sleep aid or ignore it - even as you delight in his books about his patients."
4,Tell a story,"To encourage creativity, this book is excellent. Red is an exciting color to start the juices flowing. What a surprise when thee are no words! The child and the ""reader"" can make up a story to fit the illustrations! Neat idea! My little ones really enjoy it as a relief from trying to read all those words."
2,A little too high concept...,"At the risk of sounding like Tom Hanks in ""Big""...I don't get it...the girl opens the book and sees the boy who opens the book and sees her...what's the fun of that? I buy six books every Christmas for nieces and nephews ages 2-8, and I couldn't figure out which of the six would find this book at all interesting...It reminds of the slow pretentious movie the critics love and you go and see it and wonder if there is someplace you could go to get the last 2 1/2 hours of your life refunded."
2,"Horribly Formatted, Words?","If you haven't yet bought this book for your Kindle, don't. The formatting is terrible (tiny picture on big screen, crazy 5 step zoom), and the book is only pictures. You have been warned..."
4,GREAT TRAVEL/LUNCH ITEM,"This product is tasty and lightweight. If you have access to a microwave, it is handy to take to work for lunch or on a trip. I highly recommend!! For a complete meal, I suggest also having a salad and/or some fresh fruit. And the fact that it is kosher is a bonus!"
3,"Good content, written to support a course","I really bought this book because I agree with the author: reactive systems are the best way to capture the complexity of real-time sytems. The content of the book is decent, it has most of the important concepts of reactive systems. Nevertheless, the presentation is not what I wanted: it is not a top down categorization and presenation of concepts but more of a linear presentation adapted towards supporting a course on on the subject. Maybe as course supporting material the book deserves a better rating but I was not looking for course."
4,Great classical music,This CD is perfect dinner music. There selections provide a great variety of moods. I recommend!!!
3,Too Hard,I was a little disappointed in the mattress. It is too hard. I have sat on other foam mattresses and they were softer. Otherwise it is okay.
4,Preventing the Holocaust,"A work of she-commissar (Bolshevik ""chaplain"") was addressed to own folks while contextual nuances of October Revolution-timing affairs between poor Jewish family and a revolutionary servicewoman giving a birth to her child and ushered back to the arms with Holocaust visions, had to some extent lost in translation.A movie-maker was ostracized at the time and had his career ruined for pro-Jewish motives of a work questioning the very basics of Bolshevik revolution, which what was unthinkable before the USSR disintegrating.Well, could such an intellectual genocide be experienced in a former communist block only?"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though a similar storyline was handled to somewhat better effect in Ballad of a Soldier, Commisar is still a reasonably interesting story of a soldier who leaves the chaos of war to the idyll of the home front; notable for its references to the Holocaust, Commisar should interest Russian film aficionados."
3,"Interesting read, poor research tool","""The World War II Quiz Book"" consists of questions and answers on a wide range of topics, including military, political, cultural and anecdotal. Arranged by year, the facts are interesting, and the book may be a good source for trivia questions. The lack of an index is a major drawback.This book is interesting to page through or to read when you have a few minutes here and there. The lack of an index makes it virtually worthless for research. Approached as a source of interesting facts to be connected with one's overall knowledge, it is an interesting read, so long as its limitations are recognized."
3,Just ok,"I see I'm the odd one out here, but I didn't see what was so great about this book. I have read quite a few books on gnosticism, and this just doesn't stand out to me. It's not bad, but it certainly isn't on the top of my list. And don't be decieved by the title, there is a little Jung and a lot of the author..which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just think the title is misleading."
2,KYB SB103 Strut boot,"I'm a little disappointed that the strut boot I received is not the same as the one pictured. I wanted the rubber boot but I got the plastic boot with the separate bumper. Basically, the SB103 (front), and the SB108 (rear) are the same plastic boot, just with a different circumference. Just make the picture match what's in the box is all I'm saying."
4,A must for power metal fans,I have to say that i am not into poer metal bands. I have heard some in the past but with the exception of Helloween i didnt like any other. Well here is another exception. Gamma Ray. This is a very good album as some other albums that they have and i recommend this album to anyone who would like to hear melodic and agrressive power metal. They sound cooland happy in their metal tone. I liked all the tracks.
4,Just right foe my Grandson.,"My 7 year old grandson likes to watch woodworking, and he is safely doing that now! So they are great"
5,important aid for genealogy,"Ms. Burgin has done a great service in bringing together this information about the graves of these Kentuckians at a very reasonable price.Write her at Mrs. Edna Burgin, 4019 Burrell Drive, Louisville KY 40216"
3,Worth a read,"Entertaining as usual, mainly due to Tas. The story dragged on in the middle without much direction. The ending didn't live up to the build up but a main character died, which made this story stand out a little more."
2,A walk down memory lane,"A walk down memory lane as Lawton visits his old characters and his old plots (including that of C.P. Snow's ""Strangers and Brothers""). Bit of a bore."
3,Not Bad for the money,"I bought The Whistler to use in my company vehicle and it isn't a bad unit for the money. I don't use it in town so I can't really testify to it's ""city"" mode but, it has more than paid for itself by saving me from several tickets on the open road. It does pick up false signals in the ""X"" band, from security systems and garage doors most likely but, not as badly as some cheaper units I've had in the past. If you want a really excellent radar detector then you'll have to spend a lot more money for something like an Excort Passport 8500 (I have one of these on my motorcycle and it's fantastic). If you want to beat the system on a budget though, the DE-1788 is a decent option at a moderate price."
3,not good with photo radar,I bought the unit specifically for new photo radar installations in Arizona. So far I have tested it against a number of known installations. For the most part it fails to detect the Redflex system until I am right in front of the camera. I do not get a lot of false alarms as mentioned in other reviews. The unit does seem to work as designed against policeman operated radar.
2,Poor quality,"I got the product only a ""couple day"", the K band was on all the time,and sometime shut off by itself.I called the factory and they helped to troubleshhot the problem. Finally I had to send it back to the factory not the vender to get it fixed (faster this way). They replaced the PCB. It works now and I don't know for how long....."
2,"Not a very good movie,but Tiana is cool,strong and sexy","""Catch the heat"" is a b-movie and I wonder why Rod Steiger accepted to act in this movie.Its main positive aspect lies in miss Tiana Alexandra's kicks.She's an Oriental catwoman.That's all"
1,Dirty Vegas's Unfortunate Sophomore Slump.,"Following a huge dance smash (2002's ""Days Go By"") and a Top Ten debut album, Dirty Vegas finally returns. With little fanfare they release their second disc, ""One,"" which abandons their club/disco roots in favor of mild adult contemporary pop. But in pursuit of musical maturity, Dirty Vegas has lost much of its edge and the promise it had on its superior debut. If the inoffesnive blandness of, say, Savage Garden is your type of groove, then this CD is right up your alley. Steve Smith sings without much in the way of emotion, and much of the songwriting comes off as flat and trite. The sole track bearing anything smacking of inspiration is ""In This Life,"" an acoustic-electro mid tempo number that'll probably sound great at your local cafe. But the rest of the CD comes up way short. Hence the title, ""One"" gets one star."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"After having excellent results from past Panasonic products, I eagerly awaited the relase of this product. My goal: convert my large LP collection to mp3's and store them on cdr & cdrw disks for playing on the road and in my office. The results: Sound quality of mp3's in the portable environment is very good when used on cdr's. However, I have had very poor sucess with all mp3 cdr & cdrw attempts, Ive tried different brands at different speeds with limited success. After complaining to Panasonnic I just recieved the folling response: ""The SLMP50 is not guaranteed to play a MP3 disc. """
3,Not worth the money....,"It is a bit expensive for what it costs. It does give some insider information from a former 'admissions advisor'. Let me save you some money, ready?... don't do the same thing everyone else does. Seperate yourself from the same things that every other 'pre-med' student does to get in... be unique... volunteer at a soup kitchen rather than a hospital, consider majoring/minoring in something other than science, do something out of the norm etc etc etc... That's it in a nut shell... you'll get a lot more of the same thing in different ways for $30 more, but hey, I'll admit that not every 'pre-med' student knows that they should try to be unique. So, it offers some good advice, but you just got it all (above) for the low low cost of nothing. So, if you're pre-med, be unique... and get a better book."
3,It's okay. . . but pretty bad for Fushigi Yugi,"It's slow and kind of a cop out. The rest of the Suzaku 7 just appear out of no where, the story becomes choppy, and at some points makes no sense. Actually, this all seems to happen in the middle episode. I don't know what happened (and I don't care enough to look), but it looked like they changed artists and the director for the middle episode. And it hurt to look at. Thankfully the last episode reverts to normal. It's not as good as some previous ones, but maybe the episode before had poisoned my feelings. Anyway, this isn't going to stop me from getting the next one. I just hope this doesn't happen again."
2,Clear but not referenced,"My title for this review pretty much says it all: the author has a clear and well thought out structure, but since these are truly essays, they contain almost no quotes or references of the source material. Had the author made use of such referencing, this could have been a powerful work. The authors' opinions are presented without the backing of the base material, and as such sound as if they are propaganda. As it is, it is of little use to a serious reader of this subject."
5,love it,Love the way dermalogica makes your skin feel and how it protects it. Doesn't feel greasy. would recommend to all women
5,Read entire book in one day We need more governors like him,"Jesse says it like it is and gives his view on how government should be, as well as a history of his entire life. He is a blue collar worker and not afraid to state it, not afraid of anything for that matter. He shows the American people how the government is supposed to run, he believes in freedom as well as the people. His life in the entertainment industry, has helped give him the edge needed to win the election for governor. I peronally feel the book is well written because of his amazing ability to relate to the American people, both in the office and in this book."
4,Jesse Ventura's Biography,"If you are curious about the man behind the reputation, read it. Taking experience from his career as a movie star and pro-wrestler, Ventura knows how to entertain, and the book flows well and kept me interested. He includes political opinions, but this isn't a big political statement, it's more a biography on a personal level. There is more about his career as Seal and his wrestling than political rhetoric. Ventura clearly states he is outspoken 'everywhere', not just on controversial issues; its just part of his personality.Finally, if you don't understand why Jesse Ventura hasn't been in politics lately, since his second term as governor ended, the book states it clearly -- Jesse believes strongly in term limits, and that included his own political career."
4,RL,"The mirror is beautiful, but it did arrive with some of the mirrors off and others that were glued on the base off-center. No problem. I put the loose ones back on with liquid nails. The shipping is overpriced by about $10.00 based on a similar mirror I purchased elsewhere."
2,...something for the ladies...,"I must say I did not enjoy this movie that much...this is a great idea badly executed...this is meant to be an erotic movie with a good storyline but it falls short on all counts...as some reviews have indicated the acting is bad, the dialogue, diction, appalling...as for the sex scenes, 'real' or 'simulated' they 'sucked' (pun intended)...the sex scenes betray the fact this movie was directed and shot by a woman probably a so called modern feminist who feels most mainstream movies are filled with too much femi-nudity and wanted to change that...this movie has too much male nudity from unnecessary male genital close-ups, explicit male masturbation in the shower, fellatio all which I beleive will be off putting to most male viewers and no female genitalia close ups at all, breasts not included... so this is something for the ladies who would like to see alot of male nudity..."
1,awkward,"this movie was so awkward, hard to watch. I should've read the reviews before I tried to watch it haha"
3,Too hard!,"Base is a superb, lavish illustrator, but most of the obscure puzzles in this mystery are way, way, way too hard for most kids to solve, and for many adults too for that matter. A frustrating experience."
5,WOW!,I thought this was a really great book. The story was intruging and I loved the way you can you your logic to figure out the mystery. I recommend this book to Clue and 2 Minute Mysteries
2,Off,"I hate this book maybe because I am biased against my instructor. I find that it is not clear and will on for pages without ever getting to the point the writer is trying to make. If you are a Java master you will get his jokes and hate him for them, if you are not you will just wonder if you are supposed to be doing something."
4,The Wah Standard,There is really no comparison if you are looking for the Wah sound. It has one job to do and it does it well. Built like a brick SH. enough said.
3,"""old stand-by""",I'm a little disappointed that effect is soo dramatic on the muffled (bass) side I like the way it screams (cry) on the top end compared to the Morely. Looking for a less suppressed and linear pedal.
3,Durability Issues with Potentiameter,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards. But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable. I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred. Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
2,"High Anticipation, Very Disappointed.","Being a LONG time fan of Cusco, owning 17 Cusco CD's, I have been waiting for this new Cusco CD with high anticipation. Well, I was greatly disappointed. This CD is not up to Cusco's level of music. I thought that if I played it a couple of times it might grow on me, but to no avail. Out of 18 Cusco CD's, I rate on the very bottom of the 18. My recommendation would be to buy any and all the other Cusco CD's. Other than this one, Sorry.. and to Michael Holm and Kristian Schultze, you are still my favorite Music Gods."
5,A must have for every FCP user,Pages and pages of useful information for the beginner and seasoned user. Packed with Final Cut Pro how-to's and quick fixes. As a professional editor this book is always by my side in case I run into a problem.
1,Very Poorly Written,"Hofmann does know editing, but he is an absolutely awful writer. Misplaced modifers and convolution abound. Six months after buying this, when I do try to refer to it, I find myself re-reading and re-reading and re-reading the same sentences in an effort to understand him - just like I did months ago when I finally gave up and put the book on a shelf. There are many better FCP books to buy."
1,Wrong Album !,"I don't want to pass judgement on this album, but it is not late 80s / early 90s material. This from '96 and is really ASIA Vol. 1 - Archiva, Payne material not Wetton."
5,Ultimate,"If you go anywhere, you'll have to get Frommer's books! They say all there is too say. Fantastic and a good vacation tool!"
5,Great coverage of features and prices,"In planning a special trip, you want to make sure all details are like you anticipate. This book helps with knowing where to go, how much things will be and gives you ideas of things you would not know were even in the area. We were able to plan our days with so many fun things thanks to this book I highly recommend it."
2,So So,It was more of the personal stories of the peasant villagers who lived with Chernobyl...not the effects worldwide or any emphasis on Cold War intensities.
3,ok but not great,Its an ok manual. the sections are not very detailed its a general overview at best. It gave me enough information to get started but i had to go online to get the exploded views of the assembly from the Volvo-penta website.
2,Dealer button is ok... you can toss the rest!,When I received this button set I was disappointed by the look and feel of the blind buttons. The dealer button is OK although not the best quality but the paint on the little and big blind buttons has completely come off (and I have not used these more than 10 nights)! I would recommend superior quality finish buttons if you are serious about your poker set.
1,ughh!,"I got swept up with british trip hoppy bands and unfortuantely, this one slipped by my better judgement. It's like a lesser Olive. If you like Olive's brand of synth-trip-pop unremarkableness, then you might like this. The best track is the lulling, downtempo track Desire, but thats it. Sorry."
3,"'Tis ok, but nothintg to get OVERLY excited about.","Ok, so Pussycat was the anthem to my summer back in 1997. My all time favourite DJ's championed it... But well, maybe I listened to it to much, or i don't know what the it soon looses its shine and well the rest of the album is nothing much to shout about. But don't get me wrong its still a great record to listen to if you are feeling open minded. This is not Oasis or Britney... Its ""real university"" musical talent, experimenting. Remember that..."
3,Pretty good book,"This seemed like an okay book for chemistry. There were a few things that we covered in class however, that were not in this book, just a couple of reactions. I recommend the book ""Pushing Electrons"" as a supplement to this to help with resonance, it helped me a lot."
2,why the new edition???,This is an excellent text! I have one criticism though. Why must a new edition come out every year/every other year? Its rediculous! The books are practically the same but the bookstore will never buy the old version back. The 5th edition cost me 120$. Thats pretty darn expensive!!
3,Orgonic Chem Text w Info Trac Printed Access,Book is in great shape (as was listed) and arrived in a timely manner (as listed) but without the Info Trac Card (not as listed). Not sure why it was not sent. Thanks
2,Didn't help me!,"This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about ""prediction"". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed. Try ""Organic Chemistry as a Second Language"" and ""Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language"". They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully."
2,Maitake Grofron_Pro,It took me $39 plus $18 broker fee to ship this four 2oz bottle from the States to Canada. Way too expensive and does not make sense. Disappointed...
5,this book changed my life,"I am an avid reader of books on many topics..spiritual, medical, educational....this book is all that and more. It has changed me. I have recommended it to many friends and all have loved it (can't put it down). This book is such a great inspirational resource for women and while the focus is fertility...even those not trying to conceive will find plenty of empowering wisdom inside this book. It offers a great perspective of who we are as females and the power of creation that is contained within us. While some of the views are a bit controversial (abortion..to have or not to have....baker is confidently pro-life) ...my pro-choice self did not at all feel put off by baker's comments on the subject. In fact, quite the opposite. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,Their Debut is what to buy,"This album is dissappointing and not anything like From Zero's debut. It has a few good songs but most of them are just too slow but I like them and ill give um 3 stars, more like 2.5 but what are ya gunna do? Just foget bout this album and buy their debut."
3,Not the same but acceptable,"I think this CD is not like their old Hardcore stuff that they used to do a lot of times i really dig this band i love them they are fkn great but you CAN""T never compare this cd of ""My So Called Life"" with ""One Nation Under"" there is no comparison it's not the same thing i think ONU is a better cd than My So Called Life by a lot!!"
1,My So called piece of sh*t,"wow. i cannot believe i even gave this BS cd a chance. i want my 35 minutes back please. after hearing the song ""the other side"", which is a great tune by the way, i read a couple reviews and went to the cd store and bought ""my so called life"" because they didn't have ""one nation under"". apparently the first disc is much better. anyways, long story short, this cd sums of the worst of the ""nu metal"" genre, and incorporates the likes of: limp bizkit (rappy garbage), linkin park (a lil metal), hoobastank (stereotypical nu metal). these bands are a DIME A DOZEN, please, listen, DIME A DOZEN. this band offers nothing new to the nu metal scene. please, save your money. this is the reason programs like kazza thrive, you couldnt pay ME to listen to these unoriginal bast*rds."
5,An excellent ambient album by Mr John Foxx,"Don't judge this CD by John Foxx's background in the pop/rock business. This is totally different, an ambient album, the same genre as Brian Eno, Harold Budd and Steve Roach. Foxx gives a special thanks to Mr Harold Budd, so it seems like he's been involved in some way (the text doesn't explain how). The album has similarities with Eno, Budd and Roach, but at the same time Foxx creates his own sound using his unique voice, often processed by large hall/cathedral reverbs. They're sometimes played backwards, which creates a haunting mood. This is an excellent album for people who like ambient. If you enjoy the works of Eno and Budd, then get this album. You won't regret it."
1,Not punk.,"This band is certainly not punk.They are, in fact, a wannabe emo band. I never thought i'd see the day when there would be a poser emo band. yeah, there are those stupid poser punk bands, [i.e. good charlotte, blink 182] but now this?In short, this band [and the music they play] sucks. majorly. If you are looking for poser punk, check out green day or blink 182. If you are looking for real punk, check out nofx, the offspring, or social distortion. However, if this is in fact what you are thinking about wasting your money on, then consider a lobotomy."
1,I looovvveee yellow card,"yaaaaaaahhhhh, I'm a little teenager who loves yellowcard and nfg. I mean, how could you not love them????. their lyrics are sooo inspiring. listin to the lyricz:There's a place off Ocean AvenueWhere I used to sit and talk with youWe were both 16And it felt so rightSleeping all day, staying up all nightStaying up all night.I'm not even 16 and it makes me wanna stay up all night!!!! these guys rox becuz they rhyme with their lyrics too!!!....not realy...im not a little teenager, i hate yellowcard, their lyrics suck, listen to real music...listen to jimi hendrix, van halen, metallica, black sabbath, stevie ray vaughn. You wouldnt be reading this if it werent for them."
4,I wonder what it's like.....,"(...)I haven't really bought this album yet, though I'm thinkin of buyin it. Ive heard all 3 of their singles. Here's my thoughts:Ocean Ave.:5/5; I think this is their first single. Anyway, this is an amazing song. It wouldntve been as good without a violin player. Amazing song.Only One:5/5; I think it's their 2nd single. This one sounds like a song for the troops at Iraq. Great message. Great slow song.Way Away:5/5( from what I heard); I heard someone sayin that this one was their first single. This song was why I gave this album 4 stars. I never heard the whole thing. Great song from wat I heard, but only fair if I listen to the whole thing.Well, thats it for now. Id better go buy this and make a real review!"
4,OA CD by Yellowcard,"This cd was amazing. The lyrics were amazing. Especially on the song ""Believe"". The enhanced part of the cd is funny and good also. It's got extra footage from the making of ""Ocean Avenue"". Watching this part makes you want them to make a dvd. But the CD is great. I listen to it almost everyday. It really lets you listen to Yellowcard's talent. I also love the violin in all the songs. It really tones it out and it harmonizes with the other instruments and the vocals. If I was you, I would go buy this CD as soon as you can!!!"
5,Old Fan,"Ive been listening to Yellowcard for over a year now. I first stumbled upon them at Warped Tour 2002. My friends and I were chillin while we were eating and they came on stage playing the Imperial March from Star Wars. Ever since then Ive been a rabid fan. Immeadiately after their set I went and bought the Underdog EP and got it signed by the drummer. Because I was cash strapped I couldn't buy One for the Kids :(, but I was able to find it later and purchase it. I really like this new CD and if anyone enjoys this album they should definitely pickup up the Underdog EP. Despite the fact it only has a few songs, its well worth the money. I usually download music but these guys are one of the few bands that I feel deserver my money. All I hope is that they stay true to their roots and dont sell out."
5,its punk rock with a violin... you dig?,a formula that works: the combination of sean mackin on violin and benjamin harper on guitar. an amazing album that should be in everyone's cd player... not to be missed.
5,a great CD...,"i have to say, i absoloutely love this CD! i listen to it about 3 times a day for just about a year now, and i still love it. they are an excellent band, and are even cooler in person, compelling me to listen to it more. i think everyone should have a copy of this cd. they definately have a unique sound. its amazing."
5,Don't bother skipping any of these tracks!!,"Are you tired of buying cds with a couple of goods songs and skipping over the others. Well then buy Ocean Ave. There are no filler songs. Just put it in and listen from beginning to end. I guarantee you finger will not have to touch the ""next track"" button. An amazingly addicting record!!!"
5,i am amazed,"like jon, i have also been privledged to become apart of the yc family. over the past few years i've known them, i can honestly say that they are some of the kindest, most sincere guys i know. when i first heard the album i simply sat there in awe. i had known it was going to be good just because their older albums are simply awesome. but when i heard Ocean Avenue, i was shocked. i had no idea what i was instore for. they continue to blow me away. this album is insane from start to finish. i can't pick a favorite song. this cd does not leave my cd player. perfect album for when you want to rock out or to chill. and if you haven't seen them live, please go next time they are in your town. it is, without a doubt, worth it."
1,RUN AWAY,"This CD and releases like it will kill any shot of a ""Emo""/""Screamo"" world. So generic and so boring. What evil would release this crap?"
1,a fine example...,"...of what today's music has to offer. i wish i could have given this record zero stars. yellowcard is a completely ridiculous band. i hate modern music because all of it is prepackaged by major labels and shoved down our throats by radio and television stations catering to the 12-17 year old girl demographic. in a nutshell, not only do britney and ""xtina"" suck, but bands like good charlotte, blink 182, and yellowcard also suck for very similar reasons. do yourself a favor and pick up some black flag or pixies instead. your ears will thank you."
5,Better Than Expected!,"I expected this album to be flawed and cliched.The thing that spurred me on to buy this album was the fact that they have a violin player in their midst.The whole album is totally unique and amazing.From start to finish it is like a breath of fresh air.Yellowcard are one of the best bands today, their truthful songs immediately connect with you and you really feel what they are singing about. Their arrangements and music is so structured and tight. Their songs have an air of individuality, each one is a stand-alone track. These are just some of the elements that make Yellowcard one of the best bands in recent years. If you compare them with contemporaries such as Hoobastank and Finger Eleven you will find that they have way more talent.From ""Way Away"" to ""Back Home"", ""Ocean Avenue"" will take you on a magic ride fille with happiness, sadness and relaxation.Overall this makes for an incredible listen, one of the greatest rock bands in recent years, Yellowcard are here to stay!"
5,This album truly speaks to you about life !,"The first song I had ever heard from Yellowcard was Sure Shot. From the first listen I knew that this would be a band I would enjoy listening to, mainly because of that crazy violin and how different their sound was becuase of it. I then got their first album ""One For The Kids"" and the ""Underdogg EP"". Both were very good but lacked that one element that a great album has. When I heard Ocean Avenue for the first time I was blown away. Was this the same band ??? This CD no matter what song will speak to you directly. Not many albums can do that and the ones that do are classics and will be remembered forever. It is really hard to pick a favorite song from this album as they all make me feel differently, but if I'd have to choose one it would be ""Way Away"".....hands down the best album of 2003 so far, and it looks like it will stay that way !"
2,Meh...,"Why are so many people giving this CD 5 stars? I've given this album several tries and it seems as if every time I put it in I only make it half way through. This album isn't full of enough variety. The violin does add some good sound, true, but not enough. Yellowcard sounds simple plan - ish , but a bit more um ""hardcore"" i suppose?"
5,yellowcard is the best ever!,This is one of my fave bands! i ecspecially love the song ocean av. and way away. i hope they have a concert soon cuz if they do i'll be there! Good luck yellowcard! keep up the good work.
5,Ocean Avenue,"This album is awsome! Each single song is completely different. A mad fast drummer, two to three guitars (depending on the song), a good bassist and the appearance and controlling factor in a lot of the music. A violin! :). The violin gives the extra touch. Every single song on the album hits you extremely hard with emotion flowing through vocalist Ryan Keys voice. These guys all know what they are doing, and prove it with songs like ""Only One"", ""Ocean Avenue"", and ""Breathing"" to name a few songs. Each lyric is like a punch in the gut from the swift fist of reality. This is good stuff! Buy it now!!!"
3,Pretty Good,"Yellowcard is a good, disposable band that's worth a few listens. While I applaud the innovation of having a violin in a pop band, or any band for that matter, it is the only original aspect of this band. While the songs can be catchy, they can get old just as quickly. Their sound just isn't groundbreaking by any stretch. Sure, I'll agree with the reviewers who said they're much more innovative than Good Charlotte, but that's saying shockingly little. If you compare this band to any of the much more original and talented bands of this generation, you'll see that Yellowcard just doesn't hold its ground. Though, I'm not going to jump on the untalented bandwagon, as this is album is a light, fun summery album. Just don't expect it to be a fixture in your CD player for any extended period of time."
3,this cd is good,"ocean avenue truly is a great cd addition to punk/pop. although i thought one for the kids had a lot more kick in it, ocean avenue takes more of a relationship stemmed roots. these songs are perfect to listen to on those days of tough love."
5,"Yellowcard-All rock, no fuss","Yellowcard's ""Ocean Avenue"" is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I highly recommend this album because honestly, how many punk rock bands have you heard that have a violinist? Yeah, didn't think so. I bought this album a year ago and I still listen to it nonstop, along with every other record they have out there. Their lyrics definitely speak for the minds of this generation, with songs about breaking up with someone you love, loosing a friend, the whole situation with 911, moving away from home and friends...and of course just plain having fun. If you don't have this album already, what are you waiting for? Trust me, this one will rock your converses off."
5,YC's best yet!,"This is by far YEllowcard's best cd yet. There is a somewhat pop vibe, but it is still definately punk. With 13 awesome new songs, you're never gonna want to take this out of your cd player. The lyrics are so true in all our lives, and the chords are just so amazing. Great cd for dancing, listening to in the car, or just doing what ever."
3,whoop-dee-doo,"wow. i heard some great things about this band. i heard they were this incredible punk band and (gasp!) they have a violin. how cool is that?!not very. they are, in fact, just like any other pop-punk band that really does sound like every other pop-punk band out there. the difference? they have a violin which is pure schtick just to get that extra bit of attention. so it's 3 stars, not 2 because they are ""so outrageously different."""
1,What happend to good music,"Yeah just another pop punk band with a ""twist""I am sure this guys will do great they conform to the sound that sells money and pushes cd's salesI am sure every 12-year-old will enjoy this band"
1,ocean crapvaneue,seriously it sux violin is for classical music and even that is better than yellowcard. and what the hell kind of name is yellowcard?
1,"Generic, boring pop","Let me start by saying I'm not a pop-punk hater, in fact I like alot of it, but this album doesn't have a single track better then the first track. After hearing the first track you get excited, but the feeling is short. After hearing the next few tracks you realize how boring and plain this CD really is.If you want to hear something better purchase the new NFG, that will blow you away."
1,"Sounds Like Sum41, SR - 71, etc.","I don't know how this album ended up on my desk, but I decided to give it a listen. Well, just how can anyone differentiate between this band and any other pop/punk band on the radio today? Don't give me that violin stuff either. The singer has the same whiny voice as everyone else, and there aren't any memorable guitar riffs.Bottom line. If you are in high school, feel misunderstood, and have that teen angst thing going, you might like this album. If you want to listen to some good punk, try the Sex Pistols or the Ramones or dare I say even Blink 182. At least they've brought some originality to the table."
1,MAKE IT STOP,"Man, what a crappy band. normally i write short, simple review, but this is different. This band reaches a whole new level of mediocraty. Oh, wow, a violin. well, i got some news for you people, that is not anything original. the only thing this band has going for them is a cool drummer. they sound the same as all of the other 'rock' bands on the bane of human existance itself, mtv. Please, do not give them any money.PS. why are they are on rock against bush? yeah, they are really political. they are only on because they are poser 'punk' and it is a fad to hate bush. nothing more."
4,Love after Video,"I fell in love with Yellowcard after I saw their Ocean Avenue music video a few months ago. I told my self that I'd have to check them out. And I did. Since then I haven't taken their album out of my stereo.I never thought I'd see a punk/emo band with a classically trained violinist. But Yellowcard showed me it's possible. With melodic hamronies, and beautiful lyrics this band is one of my all time favorites."
4,Ya....,I liked this album. If you like this kind of music I would suggest that you go out and buy this CD. BUY IT
2,Should be called a short delay pedal,"I've been using danelectro pedals for a while and I've never been dissappointed until I bought this one. I also bought their BLT slap echo pedal and THIS ONE SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME! What in the world? Why make two pedals with an echo effect and call one a reverb pedal? I like warm natural sounding reverbs, which is why I bought this one, but the one built in on my Marshall amp sounds much better."
4,strange and beautiful band,"it's very safe to say that Cranes are a unique band. the music is simple and sometimes very stark with minimal elements that add a touch of fragile beauty. their unique appeal is only strengthened by the vocals, which at times, sound like a frightened child. Cranes have created a musical landscape that borrows from the composer Satie, Cocteau Twins, and maybe even a little bit of Velvet Underground. but they have twisted all these elements into a form and shape that is all their own. a challenging listen that is worth investigation."
1,There's better...,"Try Godspeed You Black Emperor for better vocal and ethereal quality, and The Creatures for something better overall."
5,Replaces a 50 year old Oster clipper,"Best made, always reliable, company always improving it's product.We started cutting hair at home during our early years of marriage when we had very little."
5,Very Satisfied,I've been using this clipper for a couple of months. It works very well. I've very satisfied with its performance.
5,"Rugged, well built clipper","Bought this unit to replace a Wahl clipper that would not stay aligned. This is obviously professional grade. A bit heavy, but looks like it should last. I like the replaceable blade design. Would have been nice to include the combs directly in the kit..."
1,Wrong Blade,"We finally got around to using the clippers (unfortunately past the return date) and found that the #000 blade that came with it doesn't fit this product. This was confirmed by our local barber. What a rip off! We specifically bought these for their close/bald shaving performance. Now we have to spend more money to buy the correct blade. What a hassle! And to think, we spent $125 (with shipping) to still not be able to cut hair. What a shame!"
5,best clippers you can buy,I bought these two years ago and wish I had invested in a good pair 20 years ago. I started out with the whal clippers at walmart for about 30 dollars. they would last around 2 or 3 years and then break in the middle of cutting my hair. I cut my hair once a week and these things rock. they have tons of power and don't ever pull my hair. the blades are easy to change and last a long time. Make sure to oil the blades everytime and grease the inside once a year. watch youtube for easy instructions. I use the 00000 blade and it cuts really close. I guarantee you wont regret buying the oster classic 76
1,"Boom Boom Boom, Bad Bad Bad.","I have bought other Masterbeat CD's before and I have really enjoyed them. Especially the ones with Brett Henrichson as the DJ. However, this is the exception. If you like so called music that has no melody but rather just noise, then you might enjoy this piece of headache. I would listen to the beginning of the songs and wait for them to take off but they never did. In a word, B-O-R-I-N-G! And repetitive with zero musical ability. Boom, boom and more boom. I couldn't even dance to this stuff it's that bad. If this is considered 'Club' music, I'd rather stay home."
4,taxgal,I was happy with the wheel. It was a decent size for what we needed it for. I was somewhat happy with this felt. It has some slightly smeared numbers unlike some of the other felts I had purchased for our party but overall a nice package for the price.
2,No wheel or chips,Today the mat came in the mail i was very surprised by the fact that it did not come with chips or a roulette wheel even though in the picture it clearly displays both i knew the price was just to good to be true. On the other hand the mat is very nice and big it almost covers the entire pool table.
1,Whit Lightning DVD,"Very disappointed in this DVD and the Company. I was so excited about ordering this movie for my husband for Christmas, until we put it in 3 different DVD players and it would not work in any. I sent an email to the Company and they responded that I ordered a none US version of the movie. Who the heck sells none US version of a movie on Amazon? They said I can return it less shipping, well the shipping cost more than the movie. I would not recommend buying from this Company and would appreciate a refund of the movie and shipping. Be very skeptical when ordering, there was no clue at all that this was some out of the country movie."
1,Zero stars for square screen not widescreen anamorphic,"Dont buy this overpriced crap, wait for the blu-ray, it will be almost as cheap and most likely will be widescreen anamorphic!"
3,"""Women and da Po-leeece""","Great flick, lousy Thought Police DVD. This PG-13 version lacks the teeth of the theatrical release.Why shucks, I've heard racier language on Sesame Street dadgummit.Burt is Burt, Bo Hopkins was an unappreciated gem...but they both lose ""cool"" points for driving 72'Ford LTDs, which no self-respecting moonshiner would have ever been caught dead in.Hey MGM, give us the real deal consarnit! 4 stars for the DVD transfer, 1 star for the editing."
2,Full-Screen means LESS MOVIE,"This really is a good film... so WHY in the world did they lop off the sides of it? It is time for a W I D E S C R E E N version of this film! In widescreen, my star rating for this film is 3.5"
3,Burt!,This is the way movies were made. But you have to get this on VHS if you don't want the edited out version. He gets the bad sheriff--just wait!
4,"Publishers are crooks, but, really want this book","I'm in the same boat as the other reviewer who pre-paid for this book over a year ago and still hasn't gotten his copy or a refund.I've finally given up and just paid again, for a copy from amazon.com just so I can freakin have the book. There's only so much waiting and so much reading other reviews before I _have_ to have it.That should tell you the detication of the fans that we'll dish out more money even after being burned by a crappy company."
4,part of any astrologer's journey,I think any astrologer in their course of learning astrology over their lifetime will benefit at some point in their journey from reading and having this book. Not too simple and not too complex. A good building block and stepping stone for your astrological journey.
5,Good Book - Does it have the CDs?,I use this book to teach a college level course to students who have no programming experience. All the examples are available for down load from the site www.ni.comIt is good.The ISBN LISTED # ISBN: 0131239260is the book with the program CDs and book in a box.Be careful with the used books and make sure youget the one with the CDs containing the program itself.
4,Clean teeth.,"I would have given it five stars, but it's awkward dealing with powder. It does seem to get my teeth really clean, though. The taste and smell is easy to get used to. The powder in the mouth? Not so much."
5,"Yes, yes, yes to Leone's Italian Cookbook","I purchased this book shortly after it originally came out in 1970. At the time, I was married to an Italian gentleman who was raised by family from the ""old country."" He never hesitated to say that with that book (I am NOT Italian), I could cook for any Italians and bring smiles to their faces! To this day, it is my favorite Italian cookbook, and I'm going to purchase it for my daughter-in-law! From 1-5 stars, this book gets a 10!"
4,Classic Italian Recipes,"Complicated recipes? My extent of cooking includes boiling water and grilling steaks. I tried making Mama's Meat sauce,Meatballs, And soups. I went with the recipes word for word. No problem, short of losing one of my fingers, but it blended well with the sauce."
2,Didn't work for me,"Bought this unit because it was one of the only (cheap) ones that support multiple VoIP accounts. Not that I use multiple providers now, but I wanted that capability for future use. So my first objective was to make it work with my existing provider (Broadvoice).The device was configured using the provider's configuration information, which are basically 5 settings you need to change, and didn't work. The interface allows you to change hundreds of parameters, and the manuals don't help at all. After a couple days trying, I contacted Zoom support who is still supposedly working on the issue. They claim they used two units to try and replicate the problem. One works perfectly, the other has the same problems as the one I received.After three weeks of exchanging useless e-mails with support, I returned it.This product has a lot of potential, and I'm sure it works for a lot of people, but it didn't work for me so hence my two stars."
3,"Great map, got quite beat up in shipping","This map has great details, interesting facts and flags for each country, and is a welcome change from the common Mercator projection (with the enormously bloated appearance of Canada, Alaska, and Russia).The map came in a tube, but it must have gotten squished while being shipped. A stronger container would have been nice since there are many dings and folds on the map.I currently use it in my classroom mounted to the wall with five 3M strips."
3,Unless you are a HUGE James Marsters fan...,"If you have all the episodes on DVD, don't bother. Only 15 minutes of extras, including clips."
4,An absolute gem,"Along with Gerard Lesne's recording of Bononcini cantatas on Virgin (now reissued as librettoless budget double), this is one of the best monuments to the older of the Bononcini brothers. The recording dates from 1988 and Cristina Miatello is on typically fine form.The only niggle (as always with Tactus) is the lack of English translations with the Italian texts, but you can always lie back and enjoy the beauty of Ms. Miatello's warbling. Tactus are to be congratulated for digging out many gems from the 17th Century... cantatas by Conti, Leo, and of course Vivaldi, among them. It's worth noting here Tactus tribute to the younger Bononcini brother - The Decapitation of John the Baptist - conducted by Sandro Volta, recorded 1999. Not everyone's taste perhaps but a reminder that all musical families mixed sacred and secular at the time."
3,Too Many Codes,"The book's message is right-on. However, there are just too many codes used. I had to back-track to review the meaning of the codes. I prefer reference books that are straight forward."
5,unusual and fun addition to any christmas library!,"Being a songwriter in Nashville, I was very impressed with the originality of all the songs. It is so refreshing to hear new songs about the holidays and this certainly takes you for a ""new ride""! Witty and clever, to two-stepping and foot stomping on over to heart-warming and meaningful...I've enjoyed this CD, so much, I still play it after Christmas and it's already June!...but I'm looking at it now, as getting myself in the spirit for this next Christmas!"
1,The Active Life,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book. It did not come immediately.When it finally arrived, it was so underlined and scribbled that it was too distracting to read...I gave up and threw it in the trash. Grace Clark"
1,Inaccurate. Read at Your Own Risk,"Warning: This Book May Result in Serious Injury or Death! Multiple times on a recent trans-Olympic backpack this book let our group down, and a couple times trusting Robert Woods' advice placed us in danger. Most of the inaccuracies were related to campsites and where to find them...or that they even exist at all! The most extreme incident was his depiction of Bone Camp on the trail coming down from Hayden Pass. It did not exist, and there were no other campsites. As a result our group spent 5 hours hiking in the dark on steep trails to get to the next camp. Had his writing been accurate in this case and several others, we would have had a safer and more enjoyable hike. When i bought this book i was excited about the amount of detail, but i simply cannot afford to trust Robert L. Wood. I suggest buying another book."
2,I was a little disappointed in the presentation,"The information was facinating, but putting so much time and effort into psychedelics (as a time filler) got extreemly annoying. Being told about events and saying ""I have video"" several times, but being shown animations instead was also annoying. The subject matter was amazing and I actually do believe him, but I was hoping for an actual documentary."
3,More footage of the real place,What he said was very interesting.I would have liked to see more footage of the actual place instead of lots of talking and drawings.
3,Beyond the DaVinci Code,The DaVinci Code first got me interested in the Rossyln Chapel. Brian Allan theorizes about a portal between this dimension and another. Fascinating stuff.
2,Lonesome Dove: The Ultimate Collection,"The first 5 DVDs are acceptable but the stories cannot be compared with the other Lonesome Dove productions at all. The stories in the last 5 DVDs are very boring, and poorly written. Most stories are loosely linked and the characters within the stories are inconsistent. Especially with the ""Outlaw Years"" series in the last 5 DVDs, there were no more heroes in any episodes; just a group of disrespectful western frontiers, trying to survive. Very disappointing stories, and acting! I wish I had not bought this Ultimate Collection!"
2,lonesome dove,Not what I expected. Quality of pictures not of the best.Policy states no returns unless unopened. How can you know if you don't open it?
2,"Quick delivery, item not in the condition described...","DVDs were described as in Very Good condition, but a couple of the DVDs included were scratched and kept skipping or froze often enough to make the them unwatchable."
1,Poor quality,"This Item arrived broken, the Case, and box for it was smashed and will not hold the DVD's (10), Also the labeling of the DVD's is not marked as to disc numbers 1-10 on all discs."
5,as unpleasant as mirrors usually are,"With an incredibly low budget, Wally White succeeded to piece up this little masterpiece of witty (almost Oscar Wildesque) sarcasm. Funny and incisive, the character synthesis is so true it hurts (and maybe this accounts for so many offended viewers). If you look closely enough you may find a glimpse of someone you know -even of yourself... and all unexpected mirrors are startling and/or hateful."
4,Wonderful,"The Canadian release of her second cd is just amazing. Her voice is amazing and the song ""If I Didn't Have You"" sends shivers down my spine. Excellent!"
5,Deserving of more attention!,After buying Tuesday's Child I was pleasantly surprised with Amanda Marshall's rich voice and wonderful lyrics that are moving as well as uplifting (Believe in You & Love Lift Me). If you enjoy Sarah McLachlan you will like Amanda Marshall.
5,Excellent video about the legend.,This video is an excellent comprehensive overview of Edward Abbey's life. A definite must-see if you are interested in Abbey.
3,Performance Level is Dependent on Location,"I bought a box of 3 of these recently. The one in the bathroom seems to work just fine. The one on one side of my bedroom nearest an overhead light works okay, too. But the one furthest from a light source ... not so well. So I'm going to try a full-sized plate for the one side of the bedroom that doesn't work so well and some other locations.I don't feel I wasted my money ... they're just small and don't have much surface area to absorb light."
1,junk,This was not the product I thought I was ordering. It would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it so thought I would try it. Very poorly made. Did not stick and kept falling down. Would not recommend to anyone
5,Heavy Duty Strap,"I like this strap because it is easily twice as thick as typical nylon straps, making it feel very substantial and durable. The thickness is a personal preference...you might not like the thickness because it does add a bit of weight. The strap works perfectly with electric guitars and also includes a cord for acoustic guitars."
5,"Pittock Mansion, Portland Oregon",One of the homes on this DVD is the Pittock Mansion in Portland Oregon. I have visited the Pittock Mansion which belonged to Henry Pittock of The Oregonian Newspaper on several occasions and it is a must see just like this DVD. Nice purchase for history buffs like myself.America's Castles - Newspaper Moguls
4,fun approach,"This book is a rariety in the technical world of computer books. A bit pricey at the store, but worth the wait on amazon. It really does take a new appraoch to teaching flash animation. The cartunes were laid out in a very orderly fashion and the lessons were not all jumbled together. I have other flash animation books that deal with ""principles of animation"" and the poor designs & layout are quite confusing. The Flash Animator is great lesson in computer book design, even if the price was a bit much;)ps-I love the little skateboarding guy on the back!"
3,This was not the end of the road,"You are lucky that this CD exists because this was to be the last recording of Fairport Convention at the time of it's release in Nov 79. It is a taste of their final UK tour, it features Dave Swarbrick on vocals & violin, Simon Nicol on guitar & vocals MR. Dave Pegg on bass guitar & vocals and Bruce Rowland on drums. This is Fairport doing what they do better than anyone else: PLAYING LIVE AND HAVING FUN DOING IT! No this isn't the greatest Fairport record, but it is Swarb playing the best fiddle tunes, Pegggy playing better bass than anybody has a right to, Simon and Bruce in-sinc as a great rhythm section. This band is alive and well 33 years after they formed and still tour the world to small but very happy audience. "" Matty Groves"" & "" Meet On the Ledge are on this CD (they are played at every Fairport concert) and a very wierd Version of ""Rubber Band""."
5,More than just another spiritual book!,"This was a pivotal book for me. Upon reading this clear, funny, beautifully written text, I went from being a casual ""spiritual surfer"" to jumping in with both feet! I literally could not put it down, and when I finally finished it, I decided to apprentice with Sheri, who is an amazing teacher. I have never looked back as my life has gotten better and better. I have immense gratitude for this book and highly recommend it to others with a wish that they might have the same experience."
4,all day disk,this disk is all good I listen to it in my car and at work all day long over and over. It keeps me movin and grovin. give it a try you wont be sorry.
2,Battle bust,"Graphics are good but game play was not what I was looking for, battles seemed to lack a direction and quickly become repetitive."
1,Ninety-Nine Nights wont work :(,"loves yalls fast delivery, all my games work but Ninety-Nine Nights asking if i can return it and get the one that works, not mad just wanted to play Ninety-Nine Nights"
1,Baby friendly ???,"Mustela baby products tend to be seen as middle or upper- shelve european cosmetics. At least I have seen them that way. I have bought and use bunch of them before reading labels for the first time. This one couldn't be labeled paraben-free and contain hydrogenated fat-if it's bad for human beings, does it matter which way it get into our system? And it is made for babies. I will not buy it again. One star for nice ""performance"" in the bathtub, my daughter enjoyed the great and long lasting foam and colour."
3,Miracle Tree,"The book came in good shape and was near $50.00 when I purchased it,yet the book price (paperback) says $9.95!!! Why is so much higherpriced for the book than others??? Is it out of print or what?I also had purchased 2 Moringa bottles of supplements which I NEVER RECEIVED!!It was a separate order and I never received it! I am watching to see ifI was charged for it."
4,Disaster With A Stiff Upper Lip,"""Juggernaut"" is certainly an exciting exercize with more than it's share of thrilling moments. The mostly British cast acquit themselves well probably the best being Richard Harris as an Irish munitions expert. The film is good and competently directed by Richard Lester. My qualm, through no fault of it's own, is that it falls short of classic status. If you go into ""Juggernaut"" with less than heightened expectations your enjoyment level will be enhanced immeasurably."
2,a wretched waste,"Old Kit Bag is a great Richard Thompson album, a stunning collection of songs with electrifying performances by a great band. It is one of Thompson's best, and that's saying a lot. But if you, like me, love the man and are excited by the prospect of listening to this in marvelous surround sound, forget it. The sound output is anemic, and there is absolutely nothing in the rear speakers except a bit of reverbed drums. You can get a better surround feel by using your stereo version and running the fake Dolby surround. To market this as 5.1 surround is a total sham, and a waste of money! Shame on Richard for allowing this out."
2,Great Concept but Half Baked,I was very excited about the new series when I read the book jacket. I have read every other book by James Patterson. I found this book to be overly simplistic and the plot implausable. Several of the red herrings were ridiculous and the ending was a betrayal. It just did not add up.
5,1st to Die,Excellent book. I love the Women's Murder Club series. Fascinating. James Patterson does not disappoint. Excellent read on the treadmill!
3,An entertaining read - perfect for a quiet evening,"I'm just getting around to starting this series, and have found these books available in E-format from the library.I enjoyed the book, read it quickly and am now waiting for the 2nd book in the series to become available.My only quibble, and my reason for the 3-star rating, is that I guessed the final plot twist; I much prefer having the ending sneak up on me, and be totally unexpected.That said - this is a book I recommend to others who enjoy mysteries, especially those that feature women in key roles."
2,Nails on a Chalkboard,"This is my 1st James Patterson book. I'm listening to the audiobook. I'm giving it 2 stars because I got more than halfway through. The reader makes me cringe and combined with Patterson's writing, well, I'm sure there is an audience for this book but it isn't me. The sexual aspect of the murders makes me wonder about the author, though I think he must be trying to appeal to an audience. Ditto for the concept of women banding together to solve the murder. It's all too, too cutsie. I'm embarrassed for the writer though he is probably laughing all the way to the bank. I wonder if this book was submitted anonymously if it would ever get published?"
2,Abrupt and unrealistic ending; frustrating end to exciting book,"Gosh dang it; I really enjoyed this book, until the ending when someone dies completely unnecessarily and the plot takes one final twist that's just too abrupt and unrealistic. Annoying that something so good was ruined in the end; I honestly don't know if I recommend it or not--it was interesting, exciting and realistic up until the last five chapters or so. Only read it if you have nothing else to read, otherwise it's not worth the ending frustration."
1,1st to die,"I have read a few books by Patterson ie ""Kiss the girls"" which is a really good thriller. So when I started reading his latest book ""1st to die"" I had big expectations. But what a disappointment! The book is not at all exciting, it hasn't got the touch to be classified as a good thriller. The characters are dull and thin and I would say the book is the disappoinment of the year."
4,1st to Die --- A great novel,1st to die is a great novel that keep me at the edge of my seat. It was very easy reading with a great deal of suspense. I enjoyed every chapter and felt like I knew the characters. I hope this becomes a series. Hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
4,Loved It!,I've read all of Patterson's books and was becoming disenhearted with his writing as of late. Roses are Red was his worst book and almost didn't even read this one.It was a pleasant surprise to see that he can still write a good book. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,Not his best work!,"Although the plot is engaging, with one decent twist at the end (the other ""twist"" was obvious), the characters were very underdeveloped. I like to walk away from a book still thinking about the characters and, in this one, I didn't even get to know them! Overall, I felt like I was reading the outline of a book and not the 'fleshed-out' version I would expect. It felt like the author was under pressure to deliver a book to his publisher and did not take the time to make this what could have been a great book."
4,1st to Die,"Definitely not as good as his others. The plot is quite suspenseful. However, the ending was not as well written as his other books."
5,Good Reading!,"I finished the first book and purchased the second one right away. I had been afraid to read James in the past because I dont like scarey but I read an insert without looking at who the author was and I had to have the book (guilty wives) the author James Patterson, I have been a fan ever since!!!"
3,Good start but one twist too many,"This is only the 2nd Patterson book that I've read. His writing is good, and his chapters are short and very quick reads. There was quite a buildup in the first half and I was so engrossed in it, I read it in 2 sittings. The characters were believable, and interestingly, Patterson develops the feminine protagonists fairly well. I really enjoyed the chase and piecing together of the puzzle. I could see several of the twists that came up, but that didn't detract from the suspense and excitement of the chase itself. However, Patterson went a bit too far, and threw in a plot twist which seemed far-fetched and not well thought out. Without giving anything away, it simply didn't make sense and did not fit the carefully built plot. It ruined what would have been a solid 4 star work for me."
3,patterson delivers,"I'm finding that it's more fun to read the Amazon readers reviews of the book that you just finish, than the book itself. This was my first Patterson novel, and I thought it was entertaining, and very suspenseful right till the end. THEN I read the reviews! Man! you guys opened my eyes to some flaws in the storyline I overlooked. On my own, the spooky surprise ending did leave me backtracking to see if I'd missed something. I still highly recommend this. Patterson's pretty good!"
5,Patterson does it again !,James Patterson does it again. He got my attention from the very first page as usual. AS with all of his books it is incredibly hard to put down. I'm a huge fan of Alex Cross but also really ejoyed this 1st book of his new series. I've yet to find another author that has my attention from page one and keeps it until the end. Very good book !! I only wish he'd put atleast a book a month out. I can't wait until the next Alex Cross or for the next Murders Club.
5,more twists than a san francisco street,"James Patterson is at his best in 1st. To Die. His characters are rich and deep and evil. Patterson makes you care about his Detectives as they play out the life and death they face in a race against time. Just when I thought I had it figured out -WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN. Love the book, read it in one sitting, finished it crying,stunned again at the end. First to Die has more twists and turns than a San Francisco Street. Holy Rice-aroni..it's damn good."
3,"Wow, more serial killers from James Patterson!","I'll give it to Patterson (RIP), he's figured out how to sell a LOT of books. 3 page chapters,6th grade level reading, and lots and lots of gore!This installment is interesting only because Alex Cross does not make an appearance, but itsthe same old formula. The good news is that it was an easy read (i.e. 3 hours) and had a semi-satisfying climax."
3,1st to Die first try,"This could develop into something good for Patterson. The Women's Murder Club as a follow-up to Det. Alex Cross. I enjoyed this very much, But work needs to be done on the ""women"" to strengthen their characters. Patterson definitely shows his flexability."
4,Surprised,I have never read a James Patterson novel before this one. I was pleasently surprised at how good the book turned out to be. The book was face paced and kept you guessing until the end. I already have gone out and bought book two and three. Do yourself a favor and read this book.
3,Abridged auto may not be as good,"I listened to this book on tape and really was not feeling it. I was able to finish it but felt that something was missing, it was not pulling me in. Then I saw that I have the abridged version! Try it, it wasn't bad but it also was not the best."
4,A Good Start For The Women Murders Club,"A good suspense novel from James Patterson, it'll keep you read until the end, and don't wanna let go. Fast pace, althought a little slower than Alex Cross series, but still one of the best books by James Patterson, it makes me hard to wait for the ""2nd Chance"" ......."
2,PATTERSON'S FORMULA IS TIRED,"Any fan of the more recent Alex Cross novels in the series will recognize this as a cluttered attempt to use the same tired recurring themes from Patterson's Cross novels with a new cast of characters. Should have skipped the attempt at literature and just gone straight for the movie script. Let's see how bad Hollywood miscasts THIS leading character (i.e., Morgan Freeman could be Alex Cross' grandfather.)"
2,Not at his best,"I was looking for a good thriller/mystery. What I got was an easy read better suited to a quick trip to the beach. I enjoyed the story although it was a no-thinker. I guess what I didn't care for was the double-spaced, PICA type with 2"" margins top and bottom. I would have liked the pages filled with more story. I was able to breeze through this book in one day. Better to wait for the... paperback...to come out later."
2,Patterson Going Soft,"I remember being thrilled by Patterson's earlier, hard-hitting, suspenseful novels. In ""1st To Die,"" we witness the four female protagonists frequently getting together to discuss their ailments, relationships, lonliness, and oh yes, how to catch a killer! This book made me feel like I was watching ""Oprah"" in book form.I couldn't help but think that Patterson's agent and publisher have reminded him that most mysteries are written by women, for women - and so he has decided to write like a woman. I think that from now on I will stick writers like George Pelecanos and Dennis Lehane."
5,excellent,"I finished this in two days because excellent! In this tale, he weaves together four women to form the Women Murder Club. They try to solve a case in which a killer is on the loose--killing newlyweds! As the the page turn, so does the twists and turns. It was baffling and very detailed--graphic, but nice kills--but it is worth it. James Patterson is the master of suspense writing--even if it means crossing. This is his best along with ROSES ARE RED and CAT AND MOUSE. Cannot wait for VIOLETS ARE BLUE, 2ND CHANCE, and his upcoming romance SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS."
5,1st to Die,Years ago I read romance novels and decided to start reading again a few months ago. I do not remember why I ordered a murder mystery but choose my first James Patterson book and I was hooked after that. You cannot predict his moves and find it hard to put his books down. 1st to Die was the beginning and now I have all seven of the series plus 11 of his other books to read.
3,Hard to read.,"Some of the words were too hard to read. I think my copy may have been defective. Also, there weren't enough kitty cats. Believe me, if I am ever the first to die, I will come back and haunt Mr. Patterson with love for writing such a tender, scintillating joy of a novel. I hope he's the very last to die. Very last."
1,Not publisher' size of book edition,"I collect James Patterson novels, especially the ones featuring the Women's Murder Club. I order the first two books in this series (I have al the others)...you cannot possibly imagine my disappointment when the books arrived (separately) and they were the size and print that are used in book clubs. The are considerably smaller, print smears...I will not return them but will donate them to local libray. If an individual is selling a book or other collectible they need to notify the buyer that it is NOT the publisers size copy. I was truly disappointed and it gives me pause when I consider ordering from Amazon again. Also, the books did cost any less that the full-sized edition. Sincerely, fiona Eide"
4,Patterson Packs another Punch,"James Patterson always seems to write a ""can't put down"" novel and this one was no exception. I look forward to his new books and was disappointed at first that Alex Cross was not the protagonist, but was quickly wrapped up in Lindsay Boxer. I read it quite quickly and enjoyed the twists and turns. I agree that while this wasn't his best, it delivered what I wanted at the time which was an engaging mystery which didn't require deep thinking. This was exactly what I have come to expect from Patterson and while not a great read, it was most enjoyable."
3,My 1ST James Patterson book,"I don't know how the title ties in with the story. The story moved slow for me in the beginning, but halfway through it picked up and moved very fast to the end, which was exciting, surprising, and had a lot of action. I'll definitely read another of Patterson's book. I liked the short chapters."
4,The Alice series is THE BEST!,"This book was really good! I enjoy EVERY Alice book! I've read everyone so far, except of course the one that is going to be coming out soon. I recomend this book especially for teen girls! However, compared to the other books, this one was the TINIEST bit less interesting (but its still filled with REALLY funny problems and the great characters). The series is great though, so you should ead EVERY book in it!"
1,"Moved to tears by this book, a heirloom forever","Alice in Agony is an insperational introduction to the beauty of soap opras. This book requires an ability to read, but no other mental capabilitys. This is definatly fodder for the dog. Bronze this book, don't read it. A fine book for pressing flowers, a door stop, and a fly swatter. Theres is in no plot, no point, or any charactars, but I did like the type and the name of the publisher."
3,The Agony of Alice,"I just finished The Agony of Alice today, and I have one word for it....entertaining....Not necessarily good, but entertaining for a quick read."
3,"Good for price, not durable",They work great for the price but don't expect life out of them. The rubber snapped on my goggles 2 different times
5,4 stars is an unjust opinion of this album,"See This Through and Leave is one of the best albums produced in 2002 because of its eclectic arrangement of songs. The album starts out with a creepy opener which crescendos into a chaotic blend of distorted guitar and keyboard. The listener expects this to be indicative of the other 10 tracks, but it is wholly different. I would recommend this album for anyone who is into any genre of rock. This is truly a great album, hence why it received 5 stars on allmusic.com."
4,Good Once,"Ok, I'm probably gonna get bashed for this comment, but this book was way too long - and I've never complained that a photobook was too long unless it sucked, but the irony is this book doesn't. Basically it's too much of the same thing (how creative can you actually get in a bathtub?) - the photos are great, the models decent... but I couldn't look through all 365 pages in one sitting (and no, it's not what you're thinking). I prefered ""Naked Happy Girls"" because it had more variety in the poses. If you're only gonna buy one, get that one instead."
3,Scanning is not bookmarking...important,"This is, to my way of thinking, a top of the line device for carrying pictures, music, and books. But... and this is the biggest problem, books will only be accessible if you use the elongated method of scanning and if the book is longer than 18 hours it will scan back to 0. This means for a 21 hour book, you are forced to listen to the next three hours or to turn it off and never listen to anything but the book for the next three hours. The minute you want to hear music, you lose the ability to go back to point A. Unlike the Creative Zen, it does not have a book mark feature. But you can see the information on a large and editable screen that is held in the palm of your hand. It is very accessible and easily stores information and recordings. I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of a bookmark feature and the 18 hour problem. Then I gave it 3 stars because of the response I don't have from iRiver about the annoying 18 hour scanning difficulty."
2,Their customer service is nonexistant,"Yeah it's cool but.....their customer service SUCKS!!!! My Iriver's battery doesn't last long at all. I tried calling their phone number twice. Both times I hung up after thirty minutes of no end in sight EXTREMELY frustrated. THE only way to reach them is through email it seems, so that's a couple of weeks wait.Which is ridiculous for a device that cost $200.I'm regretting not getting an Ipod. (Which is quite hilarious because I got an Iriver thinking it would be better than an Ipod.)"
5,Feels like he's still here!,"Ok, I've not actually bought this yet, but I'm going to! I read the review about the quality of the video, and that warning is appreciated. But, even just listening to the samples, this gives the feeling that he's here in the room, singing with me. The quality may not be great, but it is true Rich! He has made such a huge difference in my life and my walk with God, and he still does. I only got to see him live once, and I mourn that fact all the time! This compilation helps fill that gap."
5,Comprehensive approach to survival skill training,"I'm not sure what book the ""two-star"" reviewer read or the scope and depth of those ""15 years"" of experience. I was a trainer for 21 of my 31 years in law enforcement and for that past 10 years since retirement as a consultant and I find this book very useful. I only wish I'd had something like this 35 years ago.This is as succinct, understandable and straightforward an explanation as I have seen of survival stress, motor skill and response. Anyone with a background or interest in police firearms training, incident analysis or situation-response training should find this book relevant and will recognize much of this, as I like to say about myself, but ""never knew what to call it before.""This is not a book for cowboys or wannabes. There are no quickie ""isms"" here, but I recommend it to serious police trainers."
5,avalan best hits,i thought this was a good deal it has all the best songs of avolan although it didnt have this one song that was like the best song i ever heard of avalon but still i thought every one of these songs were good to me. trust me they are good if you listen to the samples and like them then buy this cd because you would like this cd alot. it has alot of songs at a reasonable price. so get this right now!
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"To be blunt, this book is one of the most ridiculous and sorry literary efforts I have ever had the misfortune to read. I obtained a copy long before they were out of stock ( u snooze u lose, people) and was horrified by its stupidity. It has virtually nothing to do with the videogame DOOM or the action and mayhem that made this game (and the first two novels) so popular. I'm sorry, but if I want a novel about DOOM it means I want to read about monsters and guns and combat, not ludicrous aliens named Sears and Roebuck and a wacky space adventure that makes ""Spaceballs"" seem as intelligent as Shakespeare. Don't get the wrong idea, either, because I do not want you to think this book is ""so bad it's good."" It is actually so bad it's nauseating, and my advice to any DOOM fan is to read the first two books and make up your own ending. Seriously, do not touch ""Infernal Sky"" with a nine-foot pole or kill yourself trying to obtain a copy of this drivel."
3,Fine book,The contents of this book is good enough for me. But the book is different from the image and a little weak to use.
3,WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL SONGS?,"TO START OFF WITH. THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A BROADWAY CAST ALBUM. IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OFF BROADWAY ALBUM BY LISTENING TO THE ORCHESTRA. IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A BAND THAN AN ORCHESTRA. SECOND,I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SCORE FROM THE ORIGINAL SHOW. WELL, READINNG MY BEST PLAYS OF 1964-1965, THEY LIST THE SONGS ON OPENING NIGHT AND A BUNCH OF SONGS ARE NOT ON THE ALBUM AND SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE NOT LISTED IN THE BOOK. I AM CONFUSED. ANWAY, WHATEVER IS ON THE CD IS FAIR. ALL THE PERFORMERS ARE FIRST RATE, BUT LISTENING TO THE CD, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH. PRETTY AVERAGE MUSIC. TAKE A LESSON FROM THE DRAT!THE CAT! RECORDING ON VARESE SARABANDE. NOW THATS A GREAT STUDIO CAST ALBUM. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY PICKED KELLY OVER MANY OTHER SHOWS THAT HAVE A MUCH BETTER SCORE THAT WERE NEVER RECORDED LIKE THE BODY BEAUTIFUL OR SHERRY OR LOVELY LADIES, KIND GENTLEMAN TO NAME A FEW. IF YOU ARE A BROADWAY SHOW COLLECTOR THAN THIS SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION, OTHERWISE, I WOULD PASS."
3,thirsty... red yellow black an white...,well this cartoon has similarities to peanuts an frost an santa clauses its probably the first to show different ethnics chinese guy an afro american girl etc ...its a fine holiday toon ...
5,Potatoes Potatoes by Anita Lobel,"I first read this book as a college student (studying Elem Education) and never forgot it. The plot is just marvelous and the book emphasizes the importance of family. As a middle-aged mother of two, I am now purchasing this out-of-print book for my family. This picture book is a MUST READ for children AND adults. You cannot go wrong with it!"
5,Astonishing,For our country to be involved in such a degrading way alarms me so much. I can not believe that companies are so ruthless. The video is terrific and quite the eye-opener.
4,Post-boys life goodness!,"If you liked the final boys life album, 'departures and landfalls', you will definatley like this. Guitarist/Vocalist and bassist from boys life and the drummer from Gaints chair make up the lineup. Sadly, only released one album, but at least we have that!!!"
2,Very disappointing,"There are some nice features to this radio, but on the key measure, radio reception, it fairs dismally in my location. The weather stations could be pulled in with lots of static, but FM and TV channel reception were impossible. The receiver so lacks sensitivity that two local FM stations totally overwhelmed reception from all other stations, both on the FM and TV channel bands. AM worked okay. The manual that comes with the radio says that you'll probably have to crank the hand charger for 10-15 minutes to get a cell phone charge sufficient for a one minute phone call. And that's basically a dismissive guess on their part. Thus, this feature seems pretty useless. I was unhappy enough with this product to return it."
2,Cell phone charger? Not really!,"What the vendor fails to tell the buyer, until the radio is unwrapped, is that it takes at least 15 minutes crank time to get less than a minute of cell phone charge. Secondly, the appropriate cell phone adapter tip and charge cord have to be sent away for separately."
1,Garbage!!,"Absolute garbage. Poorly built, no way it is water resistant, (battery case does not even close). POOR RECEPTION, WORSE SOUND! Do dot waste your money!I'd give it 0 stars if it were a choice!"
2,Antenna broke within 2 days,"I purchased two of these radios to have for emergency purposes. However, the antenna broke on one within 2 days of receiving the radio. This of course makes it virtually useless since I cannot receive radio signals clearly. Prior to the broken antennae, I thought the sound quality was good and clear. As for the charging of cell phones, I have not attempted this, but it did include an adapter that fits my cell. I recommend that Eton make a more durable antenenna since this radio will be used in emergency situations. I should note that I was simply listning to the radio in my backyard when I began adjusting the antenna for better reception. The antenna broke with no unusual pressure from me."
5,GIVE IT UP,"THIS ALBUM IS DOPE START 2 FINISH ,CHUCK NUTT SPITZ SUM DOPE FLOWZ 2 SUM CLEAN BEATS-STR8 OUTTA THE FLATLANDS-MOBB 2 THIS 1...FEAT.B-LEGIT,LIL JAZZ & DOONIE BABY OF COSMIC SLOP SHOP-DONT SLEEP"
4,hungry for more Tatsuro,"I have been a fan of Tatsuro Yamashitas work for almost 30 years. From way back when I lived in Japan, you could hear his music behind Japanese commercials but, I really became a fan in 1983. The sad thing is, I am in the States and it is very hard to find his music. having said all of this. Moonglow is a great cd that demonstrates his vocal and song writing skills.I hope that Amazon can add more of his cds to thier inventory.I will say that you don't have to understand Japanese to really appreciate his music.happy in AlabamaKenny Smith"
3,Not What I Expected,"This purchase was totally not what I expected. I thought it was the movie soundtrack but it is from a theater production. So if you are wanting a CD from the movie soundtrack, this is not for you! There is absolutely nothing wrong with the actual CD and the shipping was on time. I just was expecting a CD from the movie soundtrack and it was probably my own fault for not looking harder in the details."
4,This Cd is worth your money,"This Cd is really worth the money you pay for it. I had never bought one of Benny Ibara's Cds but now that I did I don't regret it. The songs are one of a kind and it's a Cd that doesn't bore you, I really recomend it."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this CD to get more ""Todo o Nada"". As it turns out, it's the only song in the CD I really like. The rest are very mellow or romantic (too romantic).I should have just downloaded the 1 song. :("
5,Doing what he's good at--making good music,"Why should you buy this album instead of all the other Oakenfold Cds out there? First, I'd like to say that Travelling is not my favorite Oakenfold CD. But, of course, that doesn't mean that it's a not a good album. In fact, it is a great album. I love it, but, it's just not my favorite, like, Tranceport and GU-NY. This album, however, is a must have for ALL Oakenfold fans as well as others looking for good trance/dance music. Eventhough it's a Perfecto Presents series, it is unlike Another World which included unmixed tracks from Vagelis, and Dead Can Dance/ Lisa Girrard, creating kind of an eerie, gothic, dark tones. Travelling, I believe, more or less falls between Tranceport and GU-NY, closely resembles his 2 years at Cream album. What works well is Okies' seamless mix combining different types of music including popular dance track, Dooms Night and a couple of smooth-out DJ Tiesto's tracks. Utah Saints track really was surprising b/c it was so good."
4,Nice Cd,Another Cd from one of the premiere DJ's in the world. Cd 2 is far better than Cd 1....It's still worth a listen.
5,A fascinating look at culture shock!,"This is one of the best books I have read recently, I could not put it down. What a wonderful clean read that could be enjoyed by anyone. The book emphasizes the cultural differences between city and country and does it with grace and respect for those who do not have modern conveniences but still have a strong spirit, determination and true grit. A perfect gift for the holidays for anyone who enjoys a good story with remarkable characters."
3,"Wish you Well, Baldacci",A very different book from one of my favorite authors. I gave it 3.5 stars and enjoyed the hills life theme.
2,disappointed,"Have read all of Baldacci's books. I'm a fan of his suspensful novels, and am surprised and disappointed to find him straying so far off from what got him there. Seemed like a simplistic story to me, rather than the intrigue that he's so good at."
1,Wake Me Up When It's Over,"After reading the previous 67 reviews of Baldacci's Wish You Well, I am amazed and intrigued that people can have such varied opinions. I purchased this book after a store clerk compared it to Nicholas Spark's Notebook. I think not! This is a simple, predictable beyond words story, that I had difficulty completing. Imagine watching a made for TV movie, sleeping through 3/4's of it, and waking up only to discover you didn't miss anything at all....that's what reading Wish You Well was for me. Are you sure Baldacci wrote this?"
2,This will not be a popular review -- I don't like this book!,"I'm disappointed -- the reviews had led me to expect something outstanding. Instead, I found the plot improbable and the writing uneven. My first ""gripe"" came with the depictions of the children -- has the author ever SEEN or BEEN CLOSE to a child? Then, when the children are heading up to their great-grandmother's, the description of the mountain scenery and culture is definitely beautiful and compelling . . . but he talks about things that only an adult (and an adult familiar, for example, with architecture) could know -- while it is supposed to be seen through the eyes of a 12 year-old-girl. It gets worse, but I'll leave this to others to describe. Many people say they enjoy this book, so it's probably worth buying so you can form your own opinion."
4,Mountain miracles,"Having lived in the Roanoke Valley my entire life, I understand the love Louisa had for her mountain. I have been outside the mountains numerous times but always feel like the mountains are wrapping me in their arms when I return. I will recommend the book to many especially because it is ""ROANOKE's Book for 2013!8"
2,Dull dull dull,As far as I'm aware Mr Baldacci has only written one non-thriller and on reading this I can see why. It is a boring and predictable story which was 200 pages too long
4,The Mountains are calling,"A far reach from all the suspense and action thrillers, a gendre I'm used to and prefer from DB, Clive Cussler and Stephen Coontz. However, I found the storyline to be well written intriguing and well thought out. I've learned much from the shocking experience of mountain life when compared to the big city life. It was great to invision where DB gets his likes and dislikes from as the story is pretty much about the character Lou, which is based on much of his mom's life. Kudos and much thanks DB."
2,Dullsville,"Baldacci tries something different and fails. His first three novels are super but this one, in my opinion, just does not work. Your reading time can be spend better elsewhere."
5,LTJ Bukem's Earth vol 1,"If you are looking for music to relax to like you haven't quite heard before, this is it. It is trance-y drum, bass, electronica. It reminds me of music they play at the high end trendy restaurant/bars. I use it to help me focus while I am studying for college. I previously used classical music then I used something else and this is by far the best. I could listen to LTJ Bukem over and over again. I have 4 of his albums on my iPod and I just shuffle the songs. I don't know what I would do without them!"
3,Wish it was more than shorts!,I probably would have passed on this item if I knew it was only a bunch of shorts edited together but I would recommend it to anyone trying to get a feel for the real punk scene.
1,Bad Scooter-Do Not Purchase,"Scooter is fast. That's the only good thing I can say. Vibration from street is ridiculously violent, and I was using it on brand new sidewalk. On the ninth day of riding, the scooter just stopped working. I had ridden it less than 16 miles total. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this scooter to anyone. I returned it for refund. Still waiting to see if I get my money back. : ("
1,Bad Product - Poor Service from Target,"I purchased this product from Target a year ago as a Xmas gift. I had nothing but trouble with it. The poor design caused the handlebars to continue to vibrate loose. Eventually the handle bar cracked in half creating a significant safety concern. Eventually, the power system completely failed. I contacted Target and they failed to provide any remedy. It is concerning to me that Target would sell a product that was unsafe at the time and ignore their customers request for help. I would not purchase this product, nor would I shop at target if you are concerned about service after the sale."
5,nice scooter!,"I just got mine this week and I'm a bit of a scooter fan. I have a gas powered scooter, and it has always been a pain to keep it running, even though I bought it brand new. I bought this one because I work on a University Campus and live across the street. So far, it has been a lot of FUN! It does pretty much everything it says it does, and it's very quiet. Extremely portable. Part of me wanted this thing to have bigger tires and a suspension system, and an optional seat, so I could navigate more terrain, or ride in comfort, but that would have killed alot of the portability. Portability is one of the biggest assets of this scooter, you can pick it up and take it to your desk with no problems at all. If you go with those other things Id like to have in a scooter, you need a place to securely park it wherever you go, cuz hauling a 60+ pound scooter in and out of buildings would be painful. I've got a feeling this scooter and I are going to have a lot of fun for quite a while!"
4,Excellent late 70s dub inspired new wave,"This sounds, in part, like a collaboration between Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and This Heat. For fans of both! Doesn't sound like Flying Lizards at all, and as long as you aren't looking for their postmodern new wave tunes you'll be fine."
3,Not just the book bot a lot more products to buy!!!,"Not quite sure if what the book presents really works. What it really promotes is a bunch of other products which you need to buy in order to go through the program. So, once I saw the prices of the other products I pretty much gave up on the whole idea and got off clonopin on my own, just by reducing the dose slowly and gradually. I really didn't need to spend more money on the products the book promotes. So, I would try this first, which is free! Then if it doesn't work for you then buy the book AND THE PRODUCTS and try it. It may work as other people said it worked for them. Good Luck!"
2,The Mild West,"Opening with a slam-bang action sequence, ""4 for Texas"" (1963) begins promisingly as Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra enjoy a comic shoot-out in the Old West. Despite the best efforts of director Robert Aldrich and a colorful supporting cast, things go downhill pretty fast. With producer Sinatra calling the lackadaisical shots, the proceedings become relaxed to the point of boredom. Dino loved making Westerns, but Frank never looked convincing in the genre. Not surprisingly, Aldrich detested the final product and Sinatra's unprofessional behavior."
3,Tango music,"I expected a little more modern tango in this cd, but this one is a classic. If you 60 and older , you going to love it"
1,Not with this name for sure.,Do this company think that a title as such will convince a serious listener?Not really... I Hope.Try again please. This name is just ugly.
2,Hard to fit the quarters in slots,"I just wanted a quarter that would fit each state, regardless of mint location which this folder does. However, I found this folder to be of poor quality. The first two pages fit the quarters fine, but I could not get the quarters to fit in the later coin slots (2007-2008).I just bought the Littleton quarter folder because of the excellent reviews I saw online and I'm very pleased with the purchase - The quarters fit great in the slots and the book cost less than this one. I threw out this folder."
3,Just Okay,"This Statehood Quarters Folder was a little disappointing to me because the dates are printed in a pale blue which makes it hard to read. Give my eyes & everyone else's a break, please. JDL"
3,Fast Shipping and Good Product,"This product arrived in three days after my order. That's fast considering that I live in Hawaii. It is good for holding the quarters tightly, you just need to press it hard so it won't fall off quickly."
4,"Fine, but incomplete","I have this folder, and while yes, the coins can be difficult to insert, once they are in the holes, they aren't going anywhere. The biggest problem with this particular folder is that the U.S. Mint decided after the success of the 50 State Quarters Program to issue additional quarters for the 2009 DC & US Territories Quarter Program, which includes coins for places like Guam and the Mariana Islands, and it would have been best if this folder included slots for them. So now, I have to seek out a new folder, and I'll be forced to pry my coins out of this one. Doesn't sound like fun :-("
4,Statehood Quarters,Official Whitman Statehood Quarters Folder: Complete 50 State Set is organized by the year the statehood quarters were released which makes it easy to locate the correct slot.
3,A little dry. Facts are questionable.,"The book is a little on the dry side and tends to ramble,but over all not a bad book. Some questionable statements about the loyalties to the Crown. It tends to portray the Palatines as all taking up arms against the Crown,which is open to question ie. American or British view."
2,buy scotty anderson's cd on J curve first...,"then you will realize, that sometimes the substance, doesnt live up to the hype..nothing against Johnny A., good guitarist actually, but, if you want to hear the real deal of this style..then spend your money of scotty anderson, who has been praised by musicians and guitar critics world wide.....or just buy his HOT LICKS video, and find out for yourself..sorry johnny, but scotty is miles ahead of this race...i was really let down with this recording."
4,Book,"Bought as a gift. Haven't read it myself, but recipient was very happy to receive it. Arrived in good condition."
5,Title=The Wanderer of the Wastland,"The book arrived as stated and in good condition. I would reccomend this book to my friends.The title of the book ""Wanderer of the Wasteland"" My husband enjoys reading westerns."
4,Good looking jeans,I find it hard to find jeans close to my size. In fact I only found about 25 pair in all on amozon.com that were 36x29. my actual size is not even offered. ie: 36x28 Which would be a great size to start marketing since no one makes that size. HINT... HINT... HINT...
5,perfect fit,"I wore the loose, straight Levi's for years.........can't find 'em anymore........the Wrangler's are even better, more comfortable, better fit, and actually look better. Somewhat thinner material, but I think they will last."
4,good quality jeans,These Wrangler jeans are surpurb quality. I'll be ordering more when the need arises.
2,Wore out fast,"I ordered this and another pair of the same style but different color. I am quite happy with the other pair, but this one has much to be desired. First, this pair fit much looser than the other one, and I almost returned it for that reason. Now I wish that I had because the corners of the back pockets now have holes that make the jeans only suitable for mowing the lawn. I have only had them about 8 months so I am not happy about it."
5,Hands Down the best Jeans Every Made!,"I've always been a Wrangler man when it comes to my jeans, mainly the traditional wrangler and the George Strait design. However, I decided to try these and feel in love. Absolutely, the most comfortable pair of jeans I wear, so much that I bought 4 pairs of the varying color. Without a doubt, I highly recommend these jeans!!"
4,Malice - 'License To Kill' (Wounded Bird Records),"As far as I'm concerned,one of the TRUE unknown metal greats that never got the break they so truly deserved.'License...' was the second of just two actual lp's these heavy metal merchants had ever put out.Believe they had released one,maybe two EP's.Basically just good rowdy old school metal.I saw them open for Nazareth awhile back.Tracks that totally did it for me were ""Sinister Double"",the title cut ""License To Kill"",""Against The Empire"",""Chain Gang Women"" and ""Breathing Down Your Neck"".Line-up:James Neil-vocals,Mick Zane-guitar,Jay Reynolds-bass and Mark Bohn-drums.Should appeal to fans of Queensryche,Sacred Reich,Judas Priest and Loudness.Check out their cameo appearance in the '88 movie 'Vice Versa'."
2,It sometimes works sometimes,I set one of these up in a conference room as a quick solution because I found it laying around the office. It usually works however sometimes it does not recognize the input and the only way I can get it to recognize signal is by switching to another input. Not my favorite product.
4,Needed book for class,"I needed a later edition for this book, but decided to save some money and get this one. I made a good choice because we haven't really even used the book in my class. Even if I don't use it for my class, this book is filled with a lot of great information regarding teaching students with special needs. I will probably refer back to it in the future when I have my own class."
5,Everything we needed,"This guide is great. Now whenever we go somewhere, I look for the InsideOut Guide for that city. The suggested itineraries and restaurant recommendations were right on target. The maps are easy to read and nice and small. The whole book fit in my smallest purse - so handy. This book made exploring the city seem more manageable."
4,Opposite of Hybrid Theory.,"Hybrid Theory was an excellent CD and Reanimation has a lot of cool remixes, but is more of a rap album than a rock."
3,Fair,"Well, it isn't Linkin Park's best work, but it's alright. Personally, I think Linkin Park was just fine without Motion Man and Fags, but, they're still good. Some remixs are just skipping versions of songs from Hybrid Theory, and others are really good. Their Remix CD ""Reanimation"" reminded me of their earlier work, which was better. It's still okay though, so It's up to you if you want to buy this so-so work."
1,ARG!! NO!!! STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT...!!!,"Just a remixe of their already ... Hybrid Theory to pump their fans for more cash. This isn't rock, so don't waste your money and make yourslef [money] richer."
1,...,"This is seriously one of the biggest reasons why this band [is bad]. Look at what they do, they make a cd and then re-mix it. What a stupid way to gain a profit. The saddest thing is; it worked. And the fans. Dear god the die hard fans of Linkin Park are just as bad as the band. You people think this is metal? You are all so blinded by corporate media that you will take anything that's thrown at you as long as it's labeled cool. Get a life. Speak your own mind. Listen to some Iced Earth, that's metal right there. So I am giving you the fair warning; don't buy this cd. You will regret it. Instead buy some Megadeth or Pantera, they destroy Linkin Puke."
2,... Boring...,"Well, I'm a Linkin Park fan, so I figured I'd be in for a treat when I heard this album... But then I listened to it. Somehow these guest artists manage to take Linkin' Park's best songs, knock the lot of 'em down a few notches in the tempo department, and take out everything that made the music interesting. Essentially, it's Linkin' Park's best work, made dull."
3,"Let's face it guys, we got scrwed....","I am a HUGE Linkin Park fan. Nevertheless, let's cut our losses. You should get this album, but you should be disappointed. There are some GREAT songs on here, but they are outnumbered by total spit. Let me list the songs that are good.2. Point of Authority remix.6. Pushing me Away remix. (Simply amazing)11. With you remix15. My december remix (better than the original)18.Cure for the itch (I don't know about you but I like this one)19. One step closer remix (very mysterious)20. Crawling remix (incredible harmony)So yeah, go get it. But be disappointed at all the weak numbers."
1,Rock to........... [...],the first album from linkin park was almost rock. i actually baught it but now with there new one......Ahh its horible... its like rap with [...] and wannaB limp bizkit and other stuff.. it is really bad.
1,Poor Finish,"This is really a poor finish to their previous cd. All the songs has been stripped of their heavy riffs and replaced by unacceptable things, metal bands are made off. If you like metal and listen to bands like Korn, System of a Down and even Linkin Park's new cd you will consider this cd alot of [junk]. Do not waste your money on this, buy Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theroy is what a real metal album should be."
2,Ghetto [garbage],"Ok....Why??? I loved Hybrid Theory, but this is just [garbage]. Over half the songs are remixed in a new ""thugged-out"" style that really tosses out all the emotion and intelligence of the lyrics. I did like My[Dsmbr, Kyur4 Th Ich, and Krwlng. But most of the rest are for all the suburban Ludacris-wanna-be's in their lowered Escalade with the gold rims."
3,Linkin Park Could Do Better,"i know linkin park could do better. so-better. but at least there are some good song remixes such as Runaway,Cure For The Itch,Points Of Authority,etc. Crawling [stunk]! Reanimation is kind of a weird name. Get it! Reanimation, re-doing the songs.Tell me what you think. Bye"""""
2,Pushed me away,"i'm a Linkin Park fan and though a few songd were still recognisable, some (In The End) and some even sounded okay, the cd was generally painfull to listen to. a complete mutilation of an encredable CD."
3,|3| Better then most remix albums but too... weird.,"Linkin Park is a pop band, but a fair one at that, and they have some creativity in them and it showed in Hybrid Theory and now in Reanimation, which while overall enjoyable is just really weird. Most of the tracks here are basically rap, but the beats are pretty horrible. There's also some clumsy techno elements that are flat out annoying. But considering this is Linkin Park, I can tolerate some of it. Many guest rappers also make an appearance, which approves the album immensily. Anyway, if you like Linkin Park, go and get the album. Just don't expect much 'rock' (as if LP ever did make rock) amd don't take it or Linkin Park seriously. Thumbs up."
2,"More Like ""Regurgitation""","This was as big of a dissapointment as Evanescence's ""Fallen"" was to me. I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Linkin Park's debut, Hybrid Theory. But this CD was pretty bad. I like the first track (Opening), track # 5 (Forgotten), and I kind of liked ""My December"" for a while. But the rest of the CD is pretty skip-able. I mean, the songs get kind of annoying after a while. The original HYBRID THEORY was 100x better than this. I see this CD as a ploy to get more money out of us. And boy, did they sure fool me! I recommend HYBRID THEORY over this. So, I'm pretty much saying to not buy this album. It's not worth the money. My favorite parts of the CD are they way they mixed up the words and formed weird words (ex. Forgotten to Frgt/10) and the CD cover art and stuff. But the CD itself wasn't that great. So, get Hybrid Theory before you get this!!! Enjoy! (um, kind of, hehe)"
1,Hybrid Theory,If ur gonna buy a cd buy Linkin parks Hybrid Theory reanimation is a poor version of hybrid theory ill give it 2 stars beacause it has 2 good songs and because ive liked Linkin Park in the past my reccomendation is too buy hybrid theory or wait for their next album.
5,Rumors of Metora being Reanimated,"I just read over on LinkinPark.com, that Mike has some ideas for redoing a couple (not the whole CD) of the songs from Meteora and releasing them. not much is known, but that would be cool, because I loved Meteora (even though a lot of people trashed it because it wasn't the same LP from before) and I would love to hear it remixed. Hybrid Theory was an amazing album before Reanimation, this CD just made it better. I mean if you hate electronica and rap, then I suggest you stay away, because that is what you will get here.This CD is for hardcore LP fans. Plus if you bought the Pankake Festival DVD and listened to the audio only tracks the remix for One Step Closer is on here, just a little shorter.For those of you who are into underground rap and stuff, some of your favorite artists may have worked on this CD! CHECK IT OUT MAN!"
4,Linkin Park is great even with the same stuff,Okay so I am not a die hard LP fan but I do have Hybrid Theory and picked up the new album. It is great. It turns old songs into epic jorneys. I think that this album is very ballsy and I credit it with the fan base. Don't give up on them becaues it is a remix album. It's in my opinon as good if not better than the first.
3,disappointed,"i love linkin park and i loved their first album, ""Hybrid Theory."" So i couldn't wait to get ""Reanimation."" i'm sorry to say that it was disappointing. the songs from ""Hybrid Theory"" were totally ""killed."" ... .let me just say that if you liked ""Hybrid Theory"", you won't like ""Reanimation.""i think ""reanimations"" (remixes) should be reserved for only rap stars...."
5,A Great Tool,The subjects of this book are GREAT mentors for the aspiring school leaders... those who TRULY seek to create leaders for our future! This is a very well written book that should be a standard text for Educational Leadership and Administration students.
4,An Excellent Read,"In Cane River, Lalita Tademy has used documented family history to spin a believable story of her ancestors, their feelings and their lives.Set in Louisiana before, during and after the Civil War, Cane River documents the triumphs and tragedies of a family of black women. Using documents discovered during family history research as the foundation of her story, Tademy endows her characters with believable feelings and motives for their actions. As slaves and barred from the usual means of improving the lives of their children, these women use the only means they have - their bodies - to secure land and a better life for their families.Using the history of the time as a backdrop, Tademy has created a vital, absorbing story that draws the reader into a world that no longer exists."
4,Very Interesting,I enjoyed it immensely! Reading everything I can about the free people of color. Thanks Lalita for the jump-start.
4,Great Read,"I enjoyed this book very much. It's the story strength under fire. These women are remarkable and an inspiration. The only thing I found was that it gets rather complected. So many generations, so many names. I had trouble keeping them all straight. Perhaps you wouldn't."
4,Family History,This book was VERY GOOD!! It made me reflect on my own family and why some of us see things differently. It also made me realize that some of the issues we (especially as black women) have today are very much related to our past. It's an excellent book. Everyone should open their minds and think about their own lives when reading this book
5,Cane River,Cane River is a book that i will read over and over.I give praise the author for her courage and stenght.It made me cry and open my heart and mind and soul.It made me feel and love more and not to judge what i don't know.It is amazing i remember when she was writing the book.I am doing the same thing finding my roots. Praise be to her.Hope we will meet someday we have so much in common.It take a spirit that is mature to give the world this divne gift.In the book when she dedicate it to her mother it really touch me.I did the samething.
4,I really enjoyed this book,Wonderful character development and a story line that kept me constantly intrigued and wanting more.
4,The author makes it real,"It's like being part of it, a member of the family and no matter where you come from you can feel what they are experiencing. I enjoyed the book for it's ability to lead me through the lives of people I otherwise wouldn't get a chance to know. The strong female lead makes it more realistic to me. I also enjoyed Evolution by Jennifer MacDonald(I got it through AMazon as well). She has an interesting female lead, different kind of story but good nonetheless."
5,A fantastic document of times gone by...,"Being utterly fascinated with the state of Louisiana, I have read my share of ""plantation tales,"" but I don't think I have ever found another book in which historic detail and emotional response flow together so smoothly. As I read, I cried for the women in the story, and I was inspired by their strength. Cane River is a fantastic document of times gone by, one that opened my eyes and touched my heart."
3,Interesting perspective,"I read this upon recommendation by my sister-in-law. While this wasn't my typical interest (I prefer thrillers or mysteries), it was very enjoyable for a change of pace and a different insight into plantation life and history.I'm the kind of person who can put down a book I don't enjoy after 40 pages or so and walk away forever. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a masterpiece of literature, but Tademy did do a beautiful job of mixing her own family history with enough fiction to build an interesting story that holds your attention to the end. I think I liked the idea of this book project and how it was put together even more than the novel itself.As I said before - great for a change of pace and a (probably) more accurate depiction of plantation life for slaves and masters."
5,Improves with each listen,Bill Nelson does a great job on this CD with this dreamy melodic effort. One thing I might add to these other fine reviews is that after listening to this many times over I believe that both songs are identical.
5,Love this book!,"I love all of the Helen Hoover series of books! I'm sadly reading my last one. If you love nature, you will love reading Helen Hoover's books."
2,IT WAS A O.K CD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IT WAS SHIPPED TO ME VERY QUICKLY. IT WAS PACKAGED AS SAID ON THE WEBSITE. I RECEIVED THE CD AND PUT IT ON MY IPOD AND LISTENED TO IT A FEW TIMES. I KINDA DON'T LIKE THE QUALITY OF THE CD. I REALLY ONLY LIKE 1 SONG.
2,Not a good mix of songs.,"I bought this CD because of one song, and other than that song, there are only 2 other songs worth listening to. Most of the songs on this CD are HORIBLE, not to mention the fact that most of these songs aren't even dance. Don't buy this CD."
2,A good CD with little replay value,"This CD is a hilarious remake of several punk classics from bands like The Ramones, The Damned, and others. This CD is really funny the first time you hear it. When I first heard My Homeboy is a Joto, I [lost it]. The second time I heard this CD, it was a little less funny. The third time, a little less, and...well...you get the picture. Now I went and sold the thing because I can't stand it anymore. It's like owning a Weird Al album: you might like it at first, but by the end you'll hate yourself for ever spending money on it.If you really want some good punk covers with endless replay value, check out Me First and the Gimme Gimmes."
3,"I hate to say anything bad about the Stokes, but...","This book was a disappointment. I think it represents a classic example of a publisher using established authors' names to crank out a nice looking book that contains very little in the way of useful information.The book has only 95 numbered pages to begin with. The first five of those are -- get this -- the title page, a page listing other Stokes publications, another title page. the publisher's information page, and the table of contents.Okay. That leaves 90 pages for content, right?Not really. The last 31 pages are given over entirely to glossy, full color bird identication photos. And approximately one third of the remaining pages are also devoted to pretty bird photographs. The book is almost entirely ""boiler plate"", in other words. What content there is is fine -- there just isn't much of it.If information is what you want, get _The Bird Garden_ by Stephen Kress (The Nation Audubon Society) instead. It's much better."
2,...it'll do -- albeit for emergency use only,"This battery doesn't quite fit nicely into the battery compartment like the one that came w/ the Moto Q does -- you have to sort of force it in, and trying to get it out can be hard. Also, a red ""x"" shows up on the Moto Q screen after it charges for a while. Could the red ""x"" mean that it's defective (the Moto Q authorized battery doesn't have this red ""x"" problem)? The vendor sent me another battery after I expressed concerns about its functionality but the red ""x"" also shows up on the second one. The battery will, however, make the Moto Q work ... well, sort of. The Moto Q seems to behave differently with this battery.I'm reluctant to use this battery except in an emergency for fear it might damage the Moto Q."
4,FOUR DIFFERENT STORIES,"I read this book and thought it was better than the first one, the main character, Alack, is far more advanced in his field in solving the crimes. Greater depth and info on the Amazian Empire, the legal system and government. The final story is long but very good. The other book, Man From Hardin, should be read first, then Chronicles One, then this book. Very good character development, enjoyed it very much. Will not return this book to the author, to bad leo."
3,Power:,"Most of my tools are De Walt. The least impressive being the hand power planner. It simply lacks power.The 3/16"" setting only works if you are cutting half inch wood.Cutting hardwood with the full width of the blade does not work, belt screech or motor stall.More HP please!We can handle the power!"
3,Several things to be aware of,"This tool is powerful and does a good job. However, there are several things that I consider design flaws.First, the depth adjustment is also the front knob/handle. It may just be me, but after a little bit of use I tend to knock the depth off a bit because of the way I'm holding the tool. It should have a way of locking in the depth.Second, the power cord comes straight out of the back. It always seems to get caught on the end of the board. If it came out the side or at an angle this would happen less often."
4,Did what I wanted it to do - but...,"This planer did a terrific job and it's first challenge was on Hickory. However, I found my self chasing the cord all the time. The cord is like a wet noodle and in fact within the first hour I cut the cord and had to splice and eventually replace the cord.The machine worked terific but the constant keeping up with the cord made it uncomfortable to work with.Yes, I would buy it again but I would hope that DeWalt can change the cord configuration and flexability to let the user concentrate on the work instead of where the cord is tracking"
5,"Wonderful, relaxing, evocative soundtrack","We are in the process of ordering this CD plus Volumes 2 and 3 (which we have not yet heard). We had earlier purchased Cadfael -- another British TV series soundtrack, and this reminds us of that one. Very different style of music, but absolutely wonderful and uplifting to listen to."
4,Tricky but fun!,"I got this DVD in the mail yesterday, and the first time I played it, I was laughing so hard at myself I thought I'd never be able to keep up. Today though, I gave it another shot. The trick is you HAVE TO stop the dvd and replay the steps until you've got them down. The instructor only goes over each step once or twice in half time before going back to the beginning and adding it into the full routine, so it would be almost impossible to get this right the first time without stopping the DVD.If you can take the time and learn the steps, this really is a fun workout. It feels really silly at first, but once you get it, you'll feel more confident. I had it down by the second day. And the best part, its a GOOD workout!"
2,Not impressed,"More of a ""how to learn dance"" than a workout video. The video is broken into 2 sections. First is the Afro-Brazilian style of dance. She only goes through the moves twice at half tempo. Then you run through the whole thing from the beginning. This music is not so bad but the music on the second part with the salsa moves is cloying. One beat going on and on.You run through both sections at the end only 2 times. So, after you do learn all the steps, it does nothing to get your heart rate up.Not recommended and the end salsa steps are not good for your knees!"
4,"nice size, useful book but some errors in it","I recently bought the book as a Christmas gift and in the first pages I used I already could found quite a lot mistakes in translation or spelling.I'm not sure if it's the first edition, but I think there is possibility in improving the book.idea and size are quite useful and nice, but there is space for improving spelling and rules etc."
1,Do not buy this translation!,"Having just finished my first run of ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" I was utterly distraught to discover that the Kropotkin translation omits two key chapters, including the incomparable Book Five, ""The Grand Inquisitor."" I've never written an Amazon.com review (besides this one), but I feel a great duty to save future readers from making an enormous, even fatal, mistake in purchasing this particular translation. Simply unacceptable."
1,Do Not Waste your Time!,"I stopped reading this book the minute the ""hero"" shook hands and made friends with the Federal Agent who raped the ""herione"". All was forgiven because he loved her. The complete disconnect of the realities and repercussions of rape by the author was sickening. Erotica and romance books are my choice always, and I am familiar with most every situation and category written. Cross this author off your list.Dom"
5,special book,This is one of the special books that is a must if you are an Aikido lover my instructor recommended living Aikido for me.
4,A very good introductory book...,"This author was once one of the brightest stars among American instructors of Aikido, having trained or trained with many of the names who are now staples in the art. This book is insightful, and purposefully narrow in its approach, by giving very detailed information about only a few of the most fundamental Aikido techniques."
1,I'm dissapointed,"I ordered this reed so I could save some money since at my local music stores they were over $20. It came and I was excited to try it out. Well...it was very unresponsive, or it'd go flat. I wont be ordering reeds of the internet ever again."
2,NOT ANOTHER FIX THE MOTHER BOOK!!!,"Very catching title, I will admit that but the book does not deliver. The book gives you tons of ways to fix yourself ( the mom) to make yourself better understand, take abuse, forgive, forget, relax, take a bath, etc. Granted when your daughter screams ""I hate you"" its fine to walk away and take a nice bath. But, when your daughter is in this century we all know things are much worse. Teenage girls are cutting themselves, doing hard drugs, having sex in middle school, running away, and much more. This book is too naive for the real world. The book is out of date and wastes your money telling the mom to not take anything personally. I don't know about you--but after 7 years of verbal abuse I just might take some of it personally."
5,"No, I'm not going crazy!","I thought I going was nuts, not knowing how to parent my pre-teen. At last, a book to let me know I was not going crazy by myself, that it is perfectly normal what we are going through, why I as the mom am the target and spring board for her growing up. It also gives ideas on how to rethink parenting, your responses to issues. It shows why ""I"" the mom am the only one, cuz I'm the closest one to her, that she is 'experimenting with life' off of. I don't feel so alone, I'm okay, and can see why I get the backwash, and the testing. I highly recommend this book to other moms and also dads too, so they can understand the battle while they watch from the sidelines."
1,Great advice if your kids perfect already!,"I wouldn't have bought this book if I wasn't dealing with a VERY defiant, and manipulative teenage daughter--so when this book assumes that I can just say the right thing and everything will be fine, is an absolute joke! This advice would be great if it worked as simply as the book says. But if you already have a tough kid, these tips are NOT going to suddenly make her see the logic in my rules. Kids don't care about the explaination of why it's wrong to dress trashy or wear too much makeup...they want what they want. This book assumes that your kid obeys you in the first place! The title really drew me in--I thought that I had finally found a book that understood what I am going through. But it's just another below-average parenting book with a catchy title!"
2,Please release another Dregs performance!,The mix on this one is unbelievably bad. I have DVDs from the 1960s that have a MUCH better audio mix. WHY did Steve release this with such poor audio??? Is this how he wants the Dregs to be preserved on their only DVD? Are there any older videos in the vaults somewhere?
1,Muzak,"Bellydancing muzak with no soul or purpose.Good music for listening while you wash your socks, as my fatherlikes saying.There are a ton of better alternatives that can represent ArabicEgyptian music, if you're interested. Classics: Mohammed Abdul Wahab, Oum Kalthoum, or pop: Najwa Karam, etc etc. For bellydancing arrangments try the Princess of Cairo, or the Wash Ya Wash, or Jalilah's cd's... etc."
4,Very good production and little price,"Most of the songs in this cd are enjoyable and really move you to dance. Most experienced dancers will like it more because it changes tempo and has many accents difficult to pick up to begginers. The only tune I was expecting to hear and never came up was a slow one, you know, so that you can use your veil or get into floorwork, but this is really a great cd to own."
4,This smells heavenly,"My hubby loves the smell of this shampoo also. It is true men love pumpkin pie scents. While the smell of this is divine, I would not recommend the detoxifying version for colored hair as it will strip the color. It rinses well and has a leave in conditioner that compliments the shampoo. I can smell this in my hair all day long."
3,The Soundtrack of my freshman year of high school....,I've been meaning to buy this cd for five years. I guess I should one day. They were all radio hits my 9th grade year of high school when I was 14.
2,"Ranked #5 out of 7 ""Small decor"" books","I ranked this near the bottom of 7 ""decorating small spaces"" books I bought. It is a translation (published in Spain), for people who transform commercial space with the help of architects, decorators, & custom-built furniture. NOTE: These are tiny apts (322-850 sq. ft.) in European cities where owners do business, not primary residences. Owners bought the bldg, so can install skylights, etc. If this is you, you'll find the photos & blueprints & sections on Furnishings, Color, Moveable Panels & Exteriors helpful. Nothing was remotely adaptable for my American condo (high rise, 1400 sq.ft., 3 BR-2 B, with small rooms."
5,Faust for...,"After grabbing my first Faust (Faust Tapes) for 49 uk pence way back when, I was grabbed. Over the next few years my Faust collection reached the max. Faust 4 was the commercial Faust; almost (but not quite) completely deviant, when measured by the band's earlier releases.But it's no less a remarkable piece of work. If Revolution #9 was to the Beatles what the Faust Tapes was to Faust, then Faust IV is the equivalent of Help!. But that's where the similarity stops.I don't think Faust ever pandered to commercialism in the way many other bands did. But if one of their albums is commercial, this is it. A superb invitation to the uninitiated to take their toes out of the water and plunge headfirst into Faust's other albums.They influenced many that followed, but forget about that. Just dive in to the only Krautrock experience that really matters, even after 30 years on."
4,Excellent overview of bush flying in the 50th state.,This is a good book for any pilot who's dreamed of flying in Alaska. Helmericks was the real thing and he tells his story with great affection and respect for his fellow fliers.
5,reality,Sometimes reality 'sucks' but it is always 'real' and one can always learn from it....read this.
3,Fun,"Not the typical collection of goth anthems -- cool, 'cause I already have/have heard a lot of those. They're great, but who wants the exact same songs in different packages? Double kudos for the Iggy Pop/Ministry track."
2,Out of Date,"The book would have been good about 10 years ago, but I've already found several major errors. For example, one certification that the book recommends, harps on, and tests on doesn't even exist anymore. Also, even though this edition was copyrighted in 2005, most of the online supplements put out by the publisher and emphasized in the book are not available anymore. In a nutshell, this book is woefully out of date."
5,Excellent book,"I learned so much from this book! It's full of great, useful, and practical information and tips to be the wife God wants you to be. I know I'll read this multiple times in the coming years."
4,Amazing... for the Solex fan.,"This is a very interesting album, not just because we get to hear early/experimental versions of Solex songs, but because they all have an acoustic sound. Hearing Solex sing versions of her songs that she doesn't mix electronically is almost shocking, and the album can be very fun at times--it's almost a shame it's over so soon. Problem is, this isn't accessible to newbies. It's doubtful if non-fans would even find the album tolerable. Newbies should definitely stick to ""Solex Vs the Hitmeister"" and ""Pick Up."""
3,Pushing the envelope,This album exemplifies music as art. Each track has a beautiful undertone to it. A few of the songs go a bit too far for my taste but all in all this is a fine piece of music. I would say this satisfies most downtempo fans as well as those looking for something somewhat different. They opened for Radiohead in Europe so how bad could they be? Definitely worth checking out.
1,These are low cost and durable...,"...but they ARE harder than dog's teeth. It is the only toy my dog has that is harder than a Nylabone, and today the vet discovered she has a lateral crack through her largest molar when he cleaned her teeth. It is now in the trash, and she will never get anything harder than a Nylabone or Kong again as long as she lives, no matter how much more they cost or how quickly she destroys them... :-("
4,The Greatest?,"James, while I'll agree that Tracy Nelson is wonderful, the statement that she is the greatest R&B, country, etc. singer is quite a stretch. Great voice and delivery, I'll give you that, but I feel that her strongest suit is her selection of material. This is a great album but it might be just a cut below ""Bring Me Home"". You should listen to it."
3,A life dissected,"Now in his sixties, successful businessman Henry Worthington narrates his life as from under a powerful microscope. Minutely detailed here, generally searching and expansive there, Cozzens gives his lead character the power and ability to delve deeply into his own life and into life in general. Unfortunately, it's a somewhat dry, scientific analysis, relieved only occasionally by ironic wit. The reader can't help being impressed with Cozzens's talent as a writer, but, in this case anyway, not so much with that of a storyteller. Without the ironic touches the book would be a dead weight. This novel is not as impressive as most of Cozzens's other works."
4,A Good Read For This Novice Home Protector,"This book was recommended to me by an instructor at a NRA class on home protection. He recommended it for its content on the psychology you must draw on in order to be effective should the time come to protect yourself, your family and your possessions.The author is an expert and relates experiences from his students and other researches in the subject.I found it fascinating reading and I have an entirely new level of respect for the military and the police who put their lives on the line to protect us."
2,"On Caombat, The Psych abd Phys of Deadly Conflict","Good information. The book itself has a very poor binding material and the last half of the book's pages pull loose while turning the page. This was required ready for a promotional exam, and several other copies purchase by follow officers have the same problem."
4,FILLED WITH FACTS,"THIS BOOK IS GOOD. IT SLAMES STRONG FACTS AND MUST KNOW KNOWLEDGE FOR ANYONE. THE TRUE LIFE ACCOUNTS IN THE STORY ARE MY FAVORITE PART, BUT IT READS LIKE A TEXT BOOK REPEATING ITSELF TO SLAME HOME FACTS YOU MUST REMEMBER."
5,BINGO,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow police officer after I was involved in a shooting. I did not read it until a month after my incident. Everything in the book seem to relate to what I was going through. I then realized what I was going through was normal, and that I was going to be alright. This book truely helped me get over a difficult time in my life."
4,GREAT,"I thought this movie was absolutely GREAT!!! I think this is probably one of the best, if not the best movie Blair Underwood has ever portrayed. I previously saw this movie a year ago before purchasing it, my friends could not believe Blair Underwood was playing this type of character and did not want to see it again, however, I can watch it over and over and over."
5,This worked out well.,I have been buying Stride Rite shoes for my son for a while. Buying them online was easy and I saved money.
4,Side fence,"This produce is really needed with this saw if cutting small molding pieces . For the price not bad could have made , if you want to take them off for any reason it would be much easier with the molded plastic . so far very happy ."
5,Love this Movie!,Such a fun movie to watch for all ages. I loved this movie as a kid and was excited when I came across it on Amazon. Still has good as I remembered it being. :)
4,great movie,"Love the movie. had it on vhs and wanted to get dvd copy. works well, color is good, and am very glad i bought it!"
1,Couldn't finish,"Sorry, I hate to give anything a 1 star rating, but when I can't stand to finish a movie it deserves no better. The worst parts for me were all the songs. I know songs are nearly always in kid's movies, but in this movie there were just way too many and they were terrible. There seemed to be another bad song every few minutes. I finally quit the movie halfway through because I got tired of hitting the mute button. Yes, the songs were that annoying. The story was not engaging enough to make me want to tolerate them. I don't think there really was a lot to the story, which is why they had to fill in so much of the movie with singing. There was nothing impressive about the art or animation either. I really can't think of much good to say about this movie."
4,Hilarious movie,"I think this movie is hilarious. It is so terrible in some aspects, that it makes you almost die of laughing. Take the song, ""The Prayer"". Beautiful song, terrible for it's scene however. It is trying to be Disney. The dragons' song? Genie from ""Aladdin"". Kayley is so much like Belle, it's not even funny. The only reason I give this 4 stars, and not 5, is because Garret and Kayley's relationship is far too cheesy. I mean, the other cheesy stuff was funny, but this is getting ridiculous! I recommend this for adults with a sense of humor and small children."
5,Do not diss the Quest!,"I loved Quest For Camelot, I watch it over and over again (a tad excessive, but never mind). Kayley is an inspiration, and ditzy enough to be funny. Cartoon makers always try to idealise their male leads, and Garrett is the only one I have ever seen where they got it right. He's as good as any Hollywood star. Devon and Cornwall are great, really funny, and my best friend and I love the songs as much as the films. (by the way, can anyone give me the lyrics to 'I Stand Alone'?)"
2,"So many big names, so much disappointment","I can't believe how many big name actors signed on to do voices for this fairly lame story. First of all, although it's not Disney, it follows the Disney formula of the time having a ""girl power"" message and featuring lots of sappy songs (none of which were sung by the actors who did the speaking voices). Second of all it was generally very formulaic: heroic girl meets heroic but unappreciated guy, they fall in love and save the day and everyone starts to appreciate the guy. There is the obligatory sidekick (two in this case, the two-headed dragon Devon/Cornwall). Ruber's a typical 'evil looking' bad guy. His minions are straight out of Disney, too. The dialogue was unexceptional; the songs were sappy and we couldn't figure out the words. I am glad this was on Amazon's bargain rack because if I'd paid more than the $7.49 I'd be really, REALLY disappointed.My 8-year-old son liked Devon & Cornwall but otherwise was rather bored with the whole thing."
5,TAMA Time !,I love tama v3 it is awsome .Igot mine acouople of weeks ago.But 1 thing i don't like mine didn't come with a instruction sheet.So can somebody tell me what age the machtmaker will come?PUNK princess!
4,Chris Botti is excellent and always has been,"This album is quintessential Botti. Ifyou are looking for good ""rainy day - hot chocolate"" type of music, this is it. Smooth, relaxing and warming."
5,a great manual,"this is gonna be so helpful for those who want to understand further ""why, how, what?"" answers of the 1979 book of common prayer, i still pull this one from my shelve to get info, gotta pry this one out of my cold dead hands to take it, this is a most useful book in getting answers, especially when a person aides in Episcopal church services, this blue book expounds those other rubrics that are currently in the 1979 book of common prayer."
1,really?,"This was a bizarre ""documentary"" which had choppy editing, no chronology, no actual Beatles music (all performed by a cover band, not even Beatles-written songs), and an odd choice of what to include, including a 5-minute interview with Mark David Chapman, Lennon's killer. I have seen a lot of Beatles footage, and there were a few things I hadn't seen before, but nothing extraordinary by any means (which is probably why other, better documentaries chose not to show it!). This is an obvious attempt to get money by slapping the name Beatles on something."
1,Only if you're DEEP into motorcross,"If you're really, REALLY, into motorcross then this might be for you. Supposedly follows Mouse McCoy the motorcycle legend and stuntman. Well, McCoy dashes in and out of the movie but following him?? Nah, not really. Movie covers five races during a Thanksgiving weekend that all look very very similar (ie on a dirt track). You won't follow McCoy during the race (ie you won't know where he stands during the race). Just a collection of motorcross shots and sloppy interviews due to poor questioning. No onboard camera shots, no aerial shots. Boring, boring, boring. Boring"
3,Disappointing,We bought this book for a summer trip to Vermont with our family with kids and found the guide not very helpful for finding things to do or places to eat in Vermont. It is more geared towards ski season.
2,"Not what a ""peterson Real Fyre"" is.","I choose the Peterson because almost every review said it was the best. This has NOT been my experience. My flame was small, my remote never worked and the only thing about the 24"" size is the log. The gas burner is smaller than all the other burners I have had with other company's log sets. We have an inexpesive set (LOWES) in our livingroom fireplace and it looks much more realistic than this."
1,Not Impressed,"This is not at all what I expected. It is all the same stuff that I have seen before and there is this guy singing Elvis' songs in the background and he can not sing very well at all. If you are a big Elvis fan, as I am, this is not worth the money. There is nothing new here at all. I was very dissappointed with this purchase. The narartor even makes mistakes. He calls Elvis's twin Jason!!!! It is Jesse!!!! Don't waste your money!!!!!! I gave it one star becausing I had too in order to submit the review."
1,Didn't fit the lampshade,"I bought 2 clamp-on lamps and 2 guards. The guards don't fit the lamps. I asked for authorization to return the guards, but the company charges an 18% re-stocking fee and doesn't pay for return shipping (almost $13), so it would have cost more to return the guards than I paid for them. I ended up attaching the guards to the lamps with nylon cable ties. An aggravating and imperfect solution. I do not recommend this company."
5,Even more wild adventures under the sea!,"Our good-looking cartoonist of the sea strikes again! In his second book, Sherman and his wacky crew are turned into human beings, visit New York City and the Nigara Falls, discover the lost city of Alantis and the lost ship of Titanic, run into the legendary Loch Ness monster, and all! Now I'm really looking forward to seeing more stuff from the truly talented Jim P. Toomey with his wicked sense of humor! Too bad this really terrific comic strip about marine life didn't always get to see the light of the day anywhere in the newspaper funnies."
5,Below...Why Did Dimension Leave It Below?,"Why did Dimension Films and Video give this movie the cold shoulder? It had a great story, cast (including: Bruce Greenwood ""Double Jeopardy"", Matt Davis ""Legally Blonde"", Olivia Williams ""The Sixth Sense"", Scott Foley ""Scream 3""), and director David Twohy ""Pitch Black"". All the ingredients for a great movie. I guess giving it a limited release and more of a straight to video status was better than a blockbuster hit. It was very scary and disturbing to watch at times, but very much entertaining. My favorite part was when they went out of the sub and were surrounded by those enormous manta rays. See this movie you won't regret it."
3,Don't feel blamed,"My daughter was diagnosed with severe verbal Apraxia and mild oral motor apraxia. After the initial shock wore off I searched high and low to find out as much as I could. I was disapointed to find that this book hardly mentioned this serious speech disorder. I also was angered by the authors attitude towards the reasons or happenings behind speech disorders. I felt that the author either blamed a birth injury or lack of parenting. My daughter has been read to every night, taken to the best pre-school for enrichment, played with at the park etc. I have been a stay at home mom and involved with her in every level. Her speech disorder is not my fault or anyone elses. It just happens. Parents with speech disabled children feel bad enough, they need a uplifting book that reassures."
1,disappointed,Seemed old and used. The sticker on the bottle was ripping off and bottle looked dirty. There is no seal on it either. I wont be using it on my baby.
1,Comes without a Security Seal,"I was excited to try this wash for my newborn who was having trouble with rashes. However when this came, it showed up without a security seal or any type of tamper proofing. I was so upset because I won't use it knowing someone could've tampered with it. So unfortunatley I can't comment on how well the product works because I wásn't able to use it. I can say that I bought this because of a friend who can't say enough wonderful things about how well it worked for her baby that had heat rash and cradle cap and has used it since and she's had 4 kids! My suggestion is buying it from any seller that is NOT: AmericaRX"
4,You know how to love me,"""You know how to love me"" (The title track) has to be one of Ms. Hyman's greatest songs ever! It'll have you dancing all night. It's also one of my personal favorites of Phyllis Hyman. Other songs on this CD that I enjoy are ""Under your spell"", ""But I love you"" (I love this song so much) and ""Complete me"". Also worth noting is that included on this CD is a bonus track called ""You're the one"". The booklet and liner notes are very impressive as well. Definitely recommended to purchase!"
5,Violet is well worth the ride,"I saw Violet last week in a small theater in Boston. Being a voracious musical theater fan, I usually know the music and the storyline by heart before I see a play. This was not the case with Violet; other than reading reviews, I knew nothing of the play. After a rousing start, I thought I was in for a letdown as the pace dragged a bit towards intermission. Was I wrong! The second act found me, at times, deep in thought, foot stomping, yearning, empathizing, laughing, crying and cheering (did I cover all of the emotions?). Other than a little overacting by the Preacher (it was actors acting debut), the performances were first rate. If it wasn't for a limited run and my travel schedule; I would probably go to see it again. I cannot wait to buy the soundtrack; you shouldn't either."
4,Surprisingly good,"I bought this CD after hearing that a local theater would be doing a production of it and I wanted to get used to the music. I ended up absolutely loving it, after thinking I wouldn't due to the subject matter. However, the score is beautiful. Lauren Ward has a wonderful voice- ""Lay Down Your Head"" is an absolutely beautiful song. The supporting cast- Michael Park & Michael McElroy, especially- are wonderful. The score is a lot of country music, and if you don't like country music, you won't like this. However, if you do (which I do), then this will be a great CD to add to your collection."
1,WHERE IN THE HECK IS IT???,Never have received it or even an email to explain. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS SELLER>
1,Maxtor U01H300,"I recently bought this model external hard drive last December 2, 2006. The advertising is very teasing but false, the manufacturer deliver different product other than as advertised. The sad part both Amazon and USACom refused to make correction to ship the product as advertised and as ordered. If you don't want to get stuck with wrong product don't buy this."
5,The ONE scum and scale cleaner that actually works.,"This product works better than anything else out there to remove hard water scale and soap scum. PERIOD. It is cherry scented and does not need hard scrubbing at all. Just spray it all over any surface, test colored grouts first (except natural stone products like marble and granite, cultured stone and marble will be OK)let it work for 5 minutes and rinse it off. For heavily coated surfaces, repeat, and use a ScotchBrite pad to help get the accumulations off. Is your glass shower door all cloudy? This is the stuff that will make the glass as clear as the day it was installed.I am a licensed California Ceramic Tile Contractor since 1990, I recommend this product to customers, I use it in my home.Eliminate cleaner is also biodegradable for you Greenies[...]"
4,"An excellent album, if also an inconsistent one","My introduction to 1 Mile North was through their debut album, Glass Wars. That album, I felt, was a consistent, gorgeous album, even if it was very restrained. The guitar melodies and (almost nonexistant) sequencing made for a gorgeous musical affair, drenched in reverb and stripped-down (but nontheless beautiful) production..Minor Shadows, on the other hand, is a far more grandiose album. The duo's incredible collection of vintage sequencers and Moog synthesizers comes out to play here. The opener, ""In 1983 He Loved to Fly,"" is easily one of the most cinematic tracks I've heard in years. Unfortunately, the opener is so strong that it easily overshadows the rest of the album. Still, there are a number of other memorable moments from the album, such as the stirring ""Black Lines"" and the pensive ""Return to From Where We Came."" The opener, however, is absolutely what makes the album, and is worth the price of the entire CD."
4,Huh...Say what?,"Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form gave me all the tools necessary to understanding poetry and poetry criticism. This book helped to clarify a number of abstruse terms which would have been otherwise both frightening and VERY confusing."
2,Faint Praise,"The pros: it is lightweight, effective protection.The cons: its sharp aluminum edges and crude clasp are uncomfortable to the touch and can scratch your PDA. And in my opinion it's rather clunky and not attractive in comparison to the Palm Hardcase."
4,Don't believe the hype!,"After reading some mixed reviews about this product I was skeptical about making the plunge. But since I have received my hardcase in the mail, I have more or less abandoned my plush leather case. This is small, sleek, sturdy and secure -- what more could you want from a protective case! And all the comments about sharp edges...well mine is just fine. Go for it!"
1,One of the worst movies ever,"This was an incredibly boring, poorly acted, dumbly directed movies I have ever seen. I was surprised how poorly even Vanessa Redgrave acted. My wife and I sat through the whole movie thinking something interesting will happen. It didn't."
5,One of my favorite films,"I'm a bit surprised to see the somewhat tepid 4-star reviews of this great film, one of my all-time favorite movies (others being Godfather I&II;, Dr. Strangelove, Notting Hill, The Player, Pulp Fiction).The acting, the plot, the direction, and the setting is marvelous. I don't even particularly like Lake Como (it's easily my least favorite destination in Italy) but I love this film!If nothing else, the movie should be remembered for the classic line ""but Como is so BORING!"""
4,Authentic contemporary surf...from Boston???,"A store clerk recommended this album to yours truly while I was purchasing some old 60s surf guitar classics. I was skeptical, to put it mildly...most contemporary surf music really leaves something to be desired. Bands turn the reverb all the way up and call it ""surf"", but it's just not the same. And these guys aren't even from SoCal! How good could it be?But this is true, honest-to-god, bust-out-the-boards-and-hang-ten surf, in the tradition of The Chantays, The Pyramids, The Avengers, and The Ventures. The guitar riffs sound great, and the band is clearly having a lot of fun, which is what surf music is really all about. In fact the only feature of this CD that makes it obvious this is a contemporary band and not out of the 60s is the quality of the recording. The ""spooky Halloween"" theme can be a little silly, but the music's good enough that it really doesn't matter.It doesn't have to be 40 years old to be real surf music!"
5,Hallmark Card Program,Found program very user friendly with many projects I will complete in minumum time and effort
1,install problems,I have not been able to properly install the product and decided it best to cut my losses and throw it out rather than risking the rest of my computer
3,Hallmark Card Studio,The graphics need some updating. I would like to see more realistic animals and better flower designs otherwise I like the product setup.
2,Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe 2006 (old version),"Just getting into this site told me that I have the ""old version"" of this card program. I previously had the 2004 version and loved it. Then I decided to go for the newer and Deluxe version. I have found that there are several cards that are unusuable as there are mistakes on the cards that can't be fixed. Considering that I haven't even got started properly and have already found these cards, I can only imagine what I am going to find as I REALLY get into the program. I am surprised that Hallmark would release something like this to the public. Given what I payed for this, ordering from Amazon, I'm really disappointed. When you buy something like this, it should be perfect!!!!!"
3,Viewing Fonts & Cards Difficult,Let me first start by saying Hallmark does have a large vas aray of fonts and cards to choose from on this CD. However; the clip art is very small in the preview/find window without much size to the preview. Also; sending e-cards proves to be just a small show ran by Windows Media Player. You can barely read the words in the card this way. I was hoping for more photo clip art rather than cartoons to choose from. I guess the best way to utilize this CD is to print only. E-cards was disappointing. The bonus to this CD is the zillion choices...just only if we could see them!
4,"Easy to use, good looking camera","This is one very good looking camera. The steel body looks sturdy and stylish. It works great and the pictures are good. The outdoor pictures are excellent, but I wish they were a little sharper.The auto-flash option is a little annoying sometimes because it flashes even in moderate daylight making the pictures look darker than it actually is.Night pictures come out nice because of the powerful flash, better than a lot of other cameras I've used..Overall a good value for money."
4,great tool after I repaired it,"The tool was terrific... until all the nuts came loose and fell off and the adjustment pin kept falling out. After I replaced the standard nuts with inexpensive nylon locking nuts and duct tape the pin into place ( I have since found that the pin falls out becasue the internal spring was not attached. I can fix this and forget the tape.), the beast lived up to it's name. My partner used a traditional roof rake. He couldn't keep up with me. The beast easily removed nails, so I didn't have to go back and remove nails left after stripping."
2,the beast,Absolutely not worth the price. Doesnt work any better than a ten dollar potato fork. Too heavy. Only plus it is good for is pulling nails.
5,"Malco ""The Beast"" Review",This tool is ideal for a tear off. The adjustable head was a great back saver.
3,"Insightful, especially with the inner dialogue.","The book drones on and on with depressing situations. Hussein, the middle brother, offers hope in this dreary tale of poverty."
5,One of the all-time greats...,"I read this years ago, but it continues to haunt me. I went on to read his other popular family novels, and loved every single one of them, too. I find that I am always looking for books by him, about him, fiction and nonfiction. He has had a tremendous influence on my life and my own writing. He has motivated me to write stories that have what I would call metaphysical 'weight.' This novel is a great tragedy, and, yes, sad, but with his other books comes humor, too - a wry look at well-defined characters. The man is a metaphorical magician, I might add. Reading him is like riding the scales with a great opera star. Read everything by this stand-out writer. You can't go wrong."
2,Disappointed,"Horse Crazy one was a wonderful movie...one of our most favorite...#2 was terrible. A lot of #2 included clips from the first movie, to the point of being almost painful. I think the producers are good people, have great principles, and made an excellent movie the first round, but fell short on the second attempt. I would watch another movie from them, but would hope HC2 was an exception."
2,Macs are cool and this author tries hard to be,"I make my living using a Mac. It is a wonderful tool with an OS I'm very comfortable using. I have no complex about using a Mac or a desire to convert anyone to the platform. I work with many people who use Windows. We all get along just fine.Kelby tries real hard to be cute, clever and cool. He's none of these to this reader. A lot of what he says may be true, but most Mac loyalists know this stuff already, and the chatty writing style used to put down PC users might not win many converts."
3,Decent Game overall but...,As others have said it's tough because the instruction manual is pooh. You can find info online but even that tends to be vague. I was a Tavern owner and getting pretty good. I had married well and when her parents passed I suddenly got in the massive gave digging business! Well i had no idea how to run it ad the instruction manual wasn't helpful so I tired selling off 2 or 3 of the four grave sites but no one was buying (I assume asking price was too much but not sure). So it was kinda tough at that point...then I dies but instead of being able to carry on in my sons body they just gave me his name and I kept my attributes. I would have preferred to have taken over him as he was since I had put him through school ect. Maybe you can but I couldn't figure out how?
4,great series,"This is one of my 12 year old daughter's favorite ""old series."" We own a number of them and we really enjoy this good, clean entertainment."
1,Full House problems!,"I don't know what is going on with the manufacturer of ""Full House""DVDs, but every time we get one it lasts about two or three months and then we lose the sound. My daughter loves to watch these shows but I'm spending a lot of money replacing them. We clean everything and the sound is just GONE!!"
5,Worth its weight in gold! A must for wine lovers.,"My sister bought one for me as a Christmas gift...I thought she was crazy spending so much on a ""corkscrew."" However, after using the Screwpull, I soon knew it was well worth the cost. The opener runs very smooth and easy...never a damaged cork! It's also very sturdy yet light and feels great in your hands. I used to buy a new wine opener every year-- no longer! This is a must for wine lovers! Consider this an investment and buy it!"
2,Unbelievably overrated,"I bought this a few years ago as this was a record that was a classic of it's genre and I was led to believe that if I liked Aphex Twin and The Orb then I would love this. And I have to say I'm not won over with this.I've played this many times and each time I play it I'm left unimpressed by it all. Sure a lot of craft must've gone into this. But it all seems so nothing-y that I'm expecting a little more substance from it. The sounds have absolutely no form to it. You can talk about this album in almost an amoeba like context - it's practically invisible, it duplicates itself countless times but not a lot else can be said about it!If you like things that aimlessly go astray then this is the CD for you. If however you want something with a little more substance than try almost anything else - it's bound to get you going."
5,Maximum Life,"creature: transmittingLifeforms, FSOL 2CD epic takes the listener through the world of the electronic brain. from the calming background melodies of ""Domain"" through the evolutionary verses and bass of ""Among Myselves"", lifeforms delivers. Though i expected nothing less from this duo of mind shattering sound alterations, It quickly grew to be my favorite FSOL release as of date. pretty impressive seeing as how it's their first real album(fsol style i mean, not including accelerator and the early days of stakker and humanoid) If you see this recording, buy it. and relax a bit. it'll be ok"
4,awesome stuff,"i sampled portions of some of the songs on this album (particularly 'flak');...the samples...don't do this music justice - the simple melody that starts in this song is one of the most beautiful and 'visual' i have ever heard, rivalled only by ""Nil"" by Autechre and ""Bocuma"" by Boards of Canada - i must buy this cd!"
1,boring boring boring,many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece.It is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning - but - you know - never judge the cover by its album.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
1,Window latches.,"OK product. Worst thing about it is it's made in China. Given the state of employment in the US, it seems there should be more effort to source products from the US using US labor."
3,"Not Hu-Man, Ro-Man...uh,duck!",Some clever puppeteers and fans of MST3K have decided to take a stab at yakking over movies as well and for the most part it's pretty funny but still not original.The film Robot Monster is presented here in 2d although it was shown upon release in partial 3D but the parts with the puppets watching Robot Monster is in 3D. Huh? You'll figure it out.Some of the quips are priceless but you can tell they are still working out some of the bugs with camera placement. A must for 3D fans but Apt. 51 Devil Bat is much better in every way except that it is shorter.Dukey
2,Yaawwwwnnnnnnnn,"This movie is offensive and probably would be beyond hurtful to children actually caught up in our foster/adoption system. However, the biggest issue this film has is that it is totally boring. Although the script was written with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mentality it fails to capture the interest of child or adult."
5,Some of Wes' best work - pure energy!,"On Something Like Bags (mistitled Back to Bach to Bock), Wes plays one of his best recorded solos. You can hear the audience in the club cheering him on. The atmosphere is great - at one point, the telephone even rings. And the energy here is phenomenal - Wes goes into chorus after chorus of magnificent single line, octave, and chordal work. A rare opportunity to hear Wes and his brothers really play."
2,DVD-VCR remote control,"I received this item today. The component itself looks okay, since I just received it I am not commenting on it. I paid an additional $10 for the remote, which was dirty, sticky, and broken. The batteries would not go in easily and looks they will not stay on track. I had to tape the cover to stay on and it looks like that was done before because the item was sticky and the glue from the tape was still on it. I had a hard time getting it to work with the component because it looks like the remote was pulled open before and all the keys do not function because of that. Not worth returning because of amount, but I will have problems with it until a new one I ordered today from the manufacturer comes in. I hope it will work with the component and I don't have in problems there. I usually don't write reviews, but this inconvenienced me and I had to spend another $20 dollars for a new remote."
4,GoVideo vs. Sony,"I own a Sony VCR and am quite pleased with it..I would rate it as 5 stars.The GoVideo isn't quite as user friendly butoverall, for the price, it rates a 4 or 5 stars.Incidentally, I paid quite a bit more for the Sony."
3,Had Promise,This product had promise but in the end I gave it away to someone who could get it fixed easily.
5,Best gun I've used for the price,"I didn't expect much from this gun, I was pleasently surprised that my little 5HP 110v 18gal cambell kept up with the gun,Spray pattern was excellent and easy to adjust, the gun is fully functional in all patterns. Regulating and set up was a breeze. I'm putting my old Binks away. Way to go Wagner."
2,Not the same as live performance,"This product arrived on time and the price was great. However, it is a movie version of this classic opera and the sync between the voices and actors is off. Very annoying. You can tell the voices were dubbed on a different track after the actors were filmed. Very poor."
1,region code A only,Most opera and classical are region free.This one is definitely region A only and does not play in region 2.Anyone want it?Still haven't seen it!!
1,Save your money - there are better La Bohemes out there!,"La Boheme is one of the most popular operas, making the top 5 together with La Traviata, Tosca, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Carmen. So it's no surprise that the music industry has produced a steady stream of recordings to capitalise on this sweet romantic story.The film with Netrebko and Villazon is frustrating for both technical and artistic reasons. Mimi requires a full lyric soprano voice and Netrebko has it. But her rendition is unpolished and slovenly, with scant attention paid to the requisite Italianate style, with questionable choices of phrasing, and with recurring mistakes of enunciation. I am not a big fan of Villazon, not so much because of his voice as because of his tendency to over-act...his Rodolfo is too playful, to the point of becoming a caricature of Rodolfo."
2,Opera for the iPhone generation,"This is definitely not a production for traditionalists.Rodolfo and Mimi have sex after finding her key, before joining the others at the Café Momus.From the beginning Mimi is dressed like a harlot -- in red, with plunging décolleté, large exposed breasts, and bright red lipstick.The set colors in general are loud and bright, the sets are incongruous, and the cinematography is grossly oversaturated in an almost cartoonish fashion.It might fly with the iPhone generation and the sex-obsessed, but I'd bet Puccini is turning over in his grave."
2,"Believe it or not, it isn't fun to kick.","I ordered 2 of these and found that believe it or not, these aren't very fun to kick. The material is a bit hard... not springy/elastic... so the kids at church don't like using it. We're playing kickball with regular 4-square balls instead.This ball is durable though... perhaps that is why it is hard?"
4,Think like a man,Think like a man was good and I enjoyed it. I haven't read the book but I got the point looking at the movie.
4,Think like a man,Think Like a Man is a great followup to the book. Interesting to see these louses in action (and reaction).
2,Pretty Bad,Basically an extended commercial for Steve Harvey's book. The most engaging part of this movie is the beautiful actresses. Could even finish it.
4,Kevin Hart!,I was dragged to this movie while it was in theaters and was surprised at how funny it was. It was not as chick-flicky as I was expecting and Kevin Hart is hilarious!
4,Take that,Men....will they ever learn....Women....will we ever learn??? It hit home on a few levels and glad they got the happy ending
3,Dissatisfied,"This movie was a no brainer (no substance)if you used any of your senses at all reviewing this movie, you already knew the punch line before the ending of the movie. But kuddos to Steve Harvey in all of his success."
5,funny,funny movie Good one! have not seen a funny one like this on a while watch this movie and you will agree
3,Think like a Man Review,Really enjoyed this and who wouldn't with Steve Harvey's wit 'it displays several views that could help out in many different types of relationships.
4,True 2 Life,Very true to life stories of the complications of finding serious & meaningful relationships and the mistakes that you make along the way. Very enjoyable movie.
4,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be this good, besides I didn't read the book. It made me laugh and really enjoyed the whole casting"
3,It was ok.,I am reading everyone's reviews and I guess I need to watch the movie again? I was really excited about this movie. With the all star cast I felt I would not have been disappointed. The movie was just ok to me. I thought it was a little much that the book was literally advertised during the entire movie not including the tidbits of advice from Steve Harvey in between. I mean the appearances from Steve Harvey I think was ok but it just seemed like the book was being pushed too hard. There are quite a few movies that are inspired by books. If you keep seeing the book throughout the movie it takes something from it in my opinion.Next. I love Kevin Hart but he was just a bit over the top in the movie. Too much. Can't place my finger on why the movie wasn't hitting for me but I will watch it again and see.
3,"A fun, Light-hearted Comedy","Here's The Lowedown on ""Think Like a Man"" (A Comedy DVD review)...Liked IT!Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook: [...]Genre: 6.5 Movie: 6What's it about?Four women have given up on getting their men to do what they want until they find a how to book written by Steve Harvey. They start using his advice about relationships, and their men start falling in line, until the men discover what the women have been doing, then the war is on.What did I think?This movie was a treat for the romantic at heart. I think the movie would have been better if it wasn't all happily ever after, but I liked it. It was funny and down to earth, with real life relationship issues that we all have dealt with. Ladies...take it from the happily married guy...Men are shallow because deep down they are afraid to be hurt. I think I just ruined Steve Harvey's book."
2,Dont believe the hype,"I read the book and based on so many friends/family talking about the movie, I was very interested to finally watch it. Overall it was pretty slow, predictable and not all that funny. The funniest part to me was the very end when they showed outtakes from the game. To each their own but I wish I could get my money back."
5,Babygirlstaa/ I really enjoyed this movie,Great movie about relationship's between five different couples who happen to be friends. Based on the book by Steve Harvey&#128516;
4,Relationships,"I have found that some of the relationships, I have been there and did not have the tools to work them out at a young age.This movie was real insightful. I thought all the scenarios were hilarious, but made you relate to each situation."
5,Great Movie!!,Think Like a Man is a well written and entertaining movie with a great cast! I loved every minute of it. I've seen it twice and I plan on purchasing the DVD when released.
2,Love the movie but bad quality disk,Bought from the seller at a good price marked as brand new. Only watched the dvd once and then it has never worked again. The movie its self is great since I was able to see it in theaters too.
4,Think Like a Man,"This movie was really good, i really enjoyed it. I think we should have more movies like this. If you haven't already seen this movie go BUY it!"
5,Must see.,Great movie. This movie was very funny and very unexpected how the guys used the same book to stay one step ahead pf the women.
2,good but not necessarily for the beginner,"This is a good book for inspiration of ideas, however, it's not a step by step guide. Like just about every book that I've seen so far on paper sculpture, they skip crucial steps which will lose the layperson. Even I had to reread the book serveral times only to go about it on my own. The authors would do better to give a more thoruogh explanation of a work than fill the book with artist showcases. I am sick of picking up coffee table books. I want a book that gives time on paper quality and tools, and techniques first and foremost."
5,Burns a line!!!,"I am a mason and I was working an doing a block foundation that the homeowner poured himself. It was graded off with a steel rake so the surface was not smooth by any means. I ended up breaking both my chalk lines the day prior so I went to buy replacement lines for them and I saw this ""animal"" on the wall. I was amazed by the rope in this. I went ahead and purchaced it and was impressed by the fact of how big the line was and it went down into the low points of the footer. There was no ""snap the line back to you"" going on here, One snap does it. Great product!!!"
2,Not Good For Background Music,"I've enjoyed the more recent offerings from Spacetime Continuum, so I thought this might be something worthy of my collection. I was wrong. While the music is good, it's often overpowered by the annoying, nasally ramblings of Terence McKenna, a man who randomly spouts off ideas that only a tweaked-out raver could appreciate. Of the six tracks contained on this CD, there were only two that were really worth listening to again: the only two that Terence, thankfully, was not a part of."
3,Another Side of Woody Herman,"Even though I am giving this 3 stars, don't buy this disc if you're looking for great jazz singing. Woody's definitely no Mel Torme or Frank Sinatra and as this all-Woody-vocal album shows, he should definitely be remembered as a great bandleader (OK, maybe not financially...) and great reed man. But on the other hand, he ain't bad. This is much better than the vocal stuff Buddy Rich did for Verve by a long shot. The reason I recommend it is that it features some great tunes by the masters, great arrangements (Marty Paich), a great band (Sweets Edison, Ben Webster, Charlie Shavers etc.) and it's just one more piece of the Woody Herman story that, crooner or no crooner, I think you'll enjoy. I did."
5,It works,It works fine. Quality is good and shipping was fast. My only complaint is the power cable gets a bit loose which then shuts the whole thing down off. Not the biggest problem but still worth mentioning. Overall i'd say if you want XM in your house this is a good way to do it.
5,XM Satelite Docking Station,"This item was a breeze to assemble. When my XM radio began to malfunction, I thought I would have to replace the expensive receiver unit. Someone suggested taking a gamble on the docking station or antenna being the defective part.. It worked like a charm.."
4,Good book,This was my first Ann Rule book to read. I found it to be very interesting that I bought more. Great book Ann!~
1,Boring Read !!,"Ann Rule must have run out of good stories to write about. I have read all her books, and every one has been great, and I usually zip through them in a few days, but this one was just awful. It took me 2 months to read....I actually had to FORCE myself to pick it up and read it. It was awful, and it was boring, and didnt get better by the end. Very disappointing. Very boring. Just plain bad."
2,Traces an Interesting History,"Though a few years old now, Schinder's quirky collection still traces an interesting history of alternative rock back 30 years, highlighting influential artists and releases in his attempts to define (or not as he says in the preface) the ""alternative"" label. Features 140 short vignettes on different subjects like the original punks, fan club stories, pretentious band names, and random trivia."
3,Cute movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it was very miscast but it has a charm all its own.The cast is stellar and the movie does hold your attention.So, if you want a nice movie see this one."
5,what a follow up,"Bowie saves band on verge of breakupMott takes 'Dudes' instead of 'Suffragette City'HistorySongs and production, my keys to a great LP (yea I'm old)This is an 'every instrument' in your face LP. To me this is the new Wall Of Sound. Guitars, drums, bass, vocals and everything else is up loud and mixed appropriately.This is enhanced by the songs. At my funeral, I want Hymn for the Dudes to be played. Poigniant lyrics and a melody to die for (no pun). As the song quiets down, the vocals get more pronounced, and the the instrumental break/guitar comes in even louder.....Ian and the boys knew what they were doing.'Ballad of' recounts Ian take on the band while becoming huge.'..Cadillac' falls into the same vein as 'Ready For Love... on the ATYD LP. 'Memphis, Honaloochie, Drivin' Sister, and Violence' just straight out rock.It's no wonder that most seasoned critics rank this LP highly in the Best Of All Time catagory.A Keeper"
5,A Easy Solution To A Complicated Problem!,"I applaud Dr. Luciani and his simple, no nonsense, common sense aproach to combating anxiety. I had to take a medical leave from work because my daily bouts with worry had gotten the better of me. ""Self Coaching"" helped me get back to work and on with my life by teaching me how to drastically reduce the amount of unnecesssary anxiety that I struggled with for so long.I suggested this book to a friend who was having similar problems. I'm happy to report that he is now on the path to an anxiety free life. He thanked me up and down for my suggestion.At first glance I didn't think a method so basic could be effective with a problem that was so overwhelming. Now, after reading and practicing ""Self Coaching"" I can't understand why I thought a cure for anxiety had to be so complicated !Thank you Dr. Luciani."
5,WOW!!! Finally...a true SELF help book!!!,"About five years ago I purchased a self-help book in hopes of solving some of the anxiety/phobia problems that had been restricting my life. This book not only jaded my view of self-help books in general, but also furthered my anguish. As a result of this book, I have severely doubted that self-help books could actually prove fruitful...and if you know me, you know that I am extremely stubborn when it comes to such matters. HOWEVER, following a collegue's recommendation, I glanced over Dr. Luciani's book in the local bookstore. I couldn't put it down! It spoke to me! And more importantly it taught me the most important lesson of my life: How to talk to, and really know my true self. This is a universal struggle that is seemingly a quixotic venture...but trust me, ""Self Coaching"" works, and works immediately! If you want to go back to living life, instead of watching it fly past you. . .first stop: ""Self Coaching"", Dr. Luciani. Enough said."
2,"Black, yes. Painted Steel NO.",This is a decent little tool box but the size is rather small. The top plate is metal of some type but is not painted black; it is chrome. The entire rest of the box is plastic. Other than a very misleading description it is OK. The 11 cent savings makes it over priced.
2,understanding a black widow,"I felt that this book helped my healing process a great deal. I came to realize what type of an emotionally vapid, self-centered, over-manipulative person you have to be to cheat on someone and then give this book to them as a means of coping with the pain that you caused them.This in turn made me realize that I was indeed the lucky one. If you are the type of emotionally sabotaging snake woman who likes to move on from relationship to relationship, but you want to make yourself feel better about the complete lack of authenticity in your life, then this book would be perfect for you to have 6 or 7 copies of. This book is a must have if you are looking for a more articulate way to tell your ex-partner 'I can't be with you because I have some pretty serious emotional baggae that I would just prefer to carry around with me from relationship to relationship, it's nothing personal."" This is like a sothing anesthetic for the pain of consumption and digestion by a Black Widow."
2,Rich did much better with his later publications,"If you are interested in the fabulous work of Rich Phaigh, look for his four video set with four workbooks, entitled, ""The Treatment of Pain,"" or ""The Onsen Technique."" These sold from ads in massage magazines in the 90's. The material in these videos and workbooks is indespensable. I no longer own the videos, but I would like to find copies. I own the workbooks, which were handed out during his four workshops which I attended. Rich also published four articles in Massage Therapy Journal, which can be found through their website author index, and he was interviewed with his bold face across the cover of Massage magazine in May/June 95."
4,My Boys Liked It,Video does what you would expect from it - shows the basics in an entertaining way. Mine came from inetvideocom and was supposed to be new but was used.
5,He's well-hung and I am hanging on...,"This CD rules! Every track is awesome and well-worth listening to over and over again. A few stand-out tracks would have to be ""Tell that Mick..."", ""The Patron of Liars..."", and ""Sending Postcards..."". If you are a fan of emo, punk, and/or any type of rock at all, DEFINITELY BUY THIS FRIGGIN CD! You will not regret it!"
5,Def. better than their newer cd,"I heard one song of this cd at least a year ago and began to love Fall Out Boy. I listened to it for months non-stop and I'm still not sick of their songs. I love every one of the songs on here and this album is, in my opinion, better than ""From Under The Cork Tree"". Their most popular song is probably ""Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy"". It's really too hard to pick the best ones but some of my favorites are: ""Tell That Mick He Just Made My List of Things To Do Today"", ""GTA/WIYB"", ""Saturday"", ""Chicago Is So Two Years Ago"", and ""Grenade Jumper"". I saw them in concert and they put on a great show. The music wasn't too great, but they were very entertaining. If you are choosing between ""From Under the Cork Tree"" and this album, definately get this one (at least first and then get the other one)."
2,Ok,"Fall Out Boy are going to be one of the biggest bands around in 2004, no doubt about it. They are very talented musicians. But the problem is that this cd is VERY unoriginal. They use the same chord progressions that every other pop punk band uses, and the chorus for song 12 sounds just like Taking Back Sunday's ""Cute W/O the E, Cut From The Team"". They also steal a bunch of Saves the Day vocal melodies and riffs. This music breaks no new ground which is ok. I just dont like this style of girly pop rock."
2,FALL OUT BOY - TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE,"Unfortunately I wasn't that pleased with this record. But moreso there music is good, but bland at best. Unfortunately their live performances are rather cheesy and they act like they are trying to have stage presence rather than having it. Unfortunately guys, I hope your follow up is better. Good luck."
5,FALL OUT BOY ROCKS,"I recently saw Fall Out Boy live and they are truly amazing.. They have a great stage prescence and they really get involved with the crowd. I started listening to Fall Out Boy after I went to the Good Charlotte and New Found Glory concert. They handed out demos and I was hooked. I picked up the CD at Best Buy and it quickly became my favorite. Each song is unique and the lyrics are so original, you can tell that they spent a lot of time writing songs and staying away from cheesy lyrics.. Their hard work shows on this album.My favorite song is ""Chicago Is So Two Years Ago"" but all the songs are great. So go out and buy this CD..you won't be disappointed."
3,A couple of good songs,"This cd has a couple of good songs (""chicago is so two years ago"" and ""grand theft autumn""), but every other song sounds the same. I didn't like this cd because there isn't any variation, none in the singer's voice, minor changes in the instrumental parts, predominantly the same tempo in all the songs, and always singing about the same thing. The two good songs mentioned make this cd worth a look, but in my opinion the cd gets boring after a couple of weeks."
1,1 Star is too high,"If it were possible to give zero stars this film would receive a -5 stars. Don't waste your time with it. It's one sided and simple minded. It presents what could be a good story in a way to make it seem legitimate. But, any real story teller will exam all sides which this does not."
2,Would not buy,Purchased two of these chairs and I cannot recommend. The chair is not worth the price. One of them broke within a few days of use. Was able to get a replacement thru Mac Sport after I paid for the shipping cost.
2,Posture Rite Lap Desk,This lap desk was a dissappointment. I do not recommend it. The cushion was filled with styrofoam and the desk surface was styrofoam covered with tan plastic. The pencil rest was glued on and you can see the dried glue oozing out. A very cheap product that I would not recommend. I went to Office Max and purchased a much better constructed lap desk with real wood surface and gel cushion for not that much more that your lap desk.Posture-Rite Lap Desk
3,Posture-Rite Lap Desk,"For the most part I really like it, however it would be a better product if there was a trough to keep writing impliments, and the ability to increase the back end to make an angle. As a person who is disabled, it has been my experience that it is too low to use in anyway, unless I prop it up on something else (my lap isn't big enough to hold all of this) The whole idea of something like this on your lap is to promote easy use, I for one can't read anything I put on it without cranning my neck since it is flat. Most reading is done with the paper or book at an angle usually 45 degrees.(Even the picture of it is at approx. 45 degree angle)."
5,Excellent game,"I'm a big Super Mario fan. I love love Mario. this game is great. Mildly challenging, right amount of fun. Great features, great visuals. Obviously a must-have for Mario fans. Easily five stars. Best DS game thus far."
5,Best game EVER!!,"This game is occupies you for hours, and it is quite fun. I have had this game for several years, and I am starting to teach my little sister how to play it. It is not too easy, yet not too challenging. I hope that they will make newer versions of this just as good. it even works on my 3DS, but it isn't 3D. it is still a great game though."
3,Wii game,Not at all what we expected. Most of that is my fault for not reading the description better - my bad
4,A new age twist on a classic,This game is thought to be ideal. It not only combines a classic favorite in video gaming but also the visual aestheticism of today's graphic quality. It was shipped along with a number of other things I had ordered (very quickly I might add) and I would definitely buy again from this seller.
5,I play when he goes to sleep,I love thius game. i play when he cannot see me playing.. (Embarassing is not it?) but this game is SO much fun...
4,Its Alright,"When I bought this game I was so excited.I thought that I'd be completely hooked.Well I wasn't.It was really boring after you die a few times.And the only power you ever get is fire,and rarely giant,and tiny.Unlike in the Wii version where you get fire,ice,giant,tiny,and a power in which you can fly.(Not to mention the red and green mushrooms).I like this game but the Wii version is worth the money.Emme"
5,Lots of fun!,Great challenging game that will provide hours of entertainment (for both children and adults)!
5,Great game...Hours of fun!!,"My son got this for his birthday and he loves it!! He has a few other games but he is always playing this one!! It's his favorite. He plays it just about everyday. His four year old sister loves it, as well as my husband. It is a big hit in our home!!"
4,great,sent quickly and in good conditon. Sender was very kind when we had trouble with game when first got it.
5,Great Collection,"If you don't own an Alabama CD this is the one to get it has some of the best songs of Alabama's Career, well worth it"
4,Good Collection,"Enjoyed the cd. Todays radio doesn't play Alabama enough.Brought back alot of good memories of good music, beer and women in tight blue jeans."
3,not as good as others,"This movie plot isn't like some of the others he has made. Also, if you want family friendly stuff, there is too much immodesty in this one."
5,Perfect tool for the Brake job,"Works great - MUCH easier than with misc clamps. Well made. The right tool for the job,But while turning handle clockwise, you must periodically turn the nut on the handle counter-clockwise to maintain pressure on the plate."
2,"As a huge fan, this is truly a surprise.","Two stars, and one and a half are for the great sound of the music, the music itself being Alpert's obvious total denial of the Tijuana Brass, my favorite band of all time. This is just at Muzak quality, really dull, uninventive attempts to sound jazzy. My advice, if Amazon permits it, is to say ""Herb, start listening to your old stuff over and over again,until you realize that only you can really bring it back to life, then do it!"""
3,very nice DVD - I saw his this past weekend too!,"Nice DVD.Could be better. Chuck is a bit too rude to Keith in rehersal footage for my liking. But hey... Keith was cool with it. Certainly not the DVDs fault for this, that was Chuck's own doing.Would have liked to see more concert footage.Chuck is the man. Saw him perfrom this past weekend in Easton, PA. 85 yrs old and still bringing the audiance to their feet. Very cool!"
5,THE MAN ROCKS,"This is such a great movie.. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stone really put it all together.. Chuck really tells his story.. And he is backed up with interviews and performances with, Eric Clapton, Little Richard, Bo, Julian Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Cray, and Jerry Lee Lewis..The movie ends with an explosive show.. A Must for any one who loves Rock and Roll.. A long movie guaranteed to please.."
4,Excellent book with plenty of insight,"I truly enjoy Mr. Fletcher's writing - a man who can so profoundly write about ""doing nothing"". As he goes off on his various hikes, he offers a tremendous amount of food for thought - around issues of environment, harmony, relationship and connection - just to name a few.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the outdoors.:-)"
2,Not worth it.,"Exiting and has good specail effects, but builds tension, worry, and lacks ""comic releif"".A bit too sad and has a little too much screaming.This movie is NOT worth seeing.Don't waste your time!"
2,ONE OF THE WORST FILMS OF 1998,THIS FILM WAS SO BAD THAT I DIDN'T CARE OF JOE DIE OR NOT. DISNEY SHOULD NEVER EVER MADE THIS FILM.
5,Good Movie,This movie is an awesome movie for all ages. It has all the action and I would recommend it if you had kids in their teens. It is a good buy and worth watching it over and over again.
1,Watch Max Keeble's Big Move isntead of this garbage,"Here is a live action movie that Disney shouldn't have made. And the Walt Disney company doesn't come out with a lot of live action movies. Or just to the animated movies, but they made this, along with Heavyweights, The Santa Clause, The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians. Max Keeble's Big Movie is a lot better than this mess."
3,Predictable plot but cool special effects,"The movie was very predictable, any idiot will be able to figure out what is about to happen. But then, this is supposed to be a 'light' family movie and kids will love it. When you put aside the fact that you are no longer a kid, you will love the movie. The acting could be improved on which is a big factor during the movie. Apart from the acting and the predictable story line, the movie is great. Actually, I give the movie 3 and a half stars."
3,Rip Off?,"This movie is great,it's moving it's exiting and it's got the best visual effects ever made in a movie before. But there is just one thing:is this movie a Rip Off from king Kong(1933)?As we now it the first ""monkey"" movie was made in 1933(king kong)And the second ""monkey"" movie was made in 1946 (mighty Joe Young)And if you rent the old king Kong movie you will see that the ending sequence in the movie is ecsacly the same ending sequence as in Mighty Joe Young Hmmmmmmm Dejavu!"
2,I love a good adventure! This isn't a good adventure.,"Boring is an understatement for this movie. I saw this at the theatre, there were only three people in there including myself, and the other two left half way through. The action doesn't excite, the characters are way too cliched as the superiors are complete idiots, the heroes know everything, and the villain is unbelievably evil and mean spirited."
3,disappointing,"Where is ""Seven Whole Days""? The charm of the original ""Spanish Guitar"" is utterly lacking on this dance remix."
1,Pointless middle-class obsession drama,"If you haven't read the book, this film has no value whatsoever. That is, unless you want to see what a body looks like having fallen to the ground feet first from a great height. I am annoyed that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this DVD, despite my wife warning me against it. (And she has also read the book.)Daniel Craig is a great actor but, despite a couple of scenes from his lectures, I couldn't even work out what subject he taught. Having read several genuine stalker cases from the legal angle, I couldn't understand why he didn't call in the police, or at least threaten to do so, against Rhys Ifans.This film should have gone straight to 4:3 TV. It makes no use of the big screen or widescreen.The musical score was actually half-decent, but wasted on this story."
3,Slow irritation,"As mentioned, the opening of the film has you sitting up, but than it drifts into a fancy photography sleeper. With the added ""bonus"" of an extra irritating Rhys Ifans, and a couple of harsh images, and a mundane ending, this flick can be avoided..."
1,Way way too much filler,"I purchased this book after reading glowing reviews. Mistake. There is too much history about Chicago, murders in general, and individuals that ultimately had nothing to do with the solving of the crime. I literally skimmed through at least 100 pages to when the ""actual"" killers were caught. A big disappointment."
2,A Big Let Down,"I was so excited to get this book because I had been reading about the tragedy for a long time and wanted to find our as much as I could. Unfortunately, this book did not provide anything useful that I already had not heard about. Half way through the book I was sick and tired about reading about what the detectives had for lunch or who their father's were. There was more background about the investigators than there was about the victims. Not to mention Possley's writing style is god awfully boringI had to struggle to get through the book and guess what? It doesn't have one sentence about the trial at ALL. It is stated that they will be coming up for a trial in a few years. What a let down! Don't waste your time or your 1 cent on it."
3,FHI Heat is better,"I bought this product because of the ceramic, tourmaline and titanium used to make it. I was thinking this iron was going to be really hot and provide lots of shine well i already have an FHI iron and its better. This iron is worth more like $30.00 to me. I'm not totally disappointed but it's just ""okay"" not all what i thought it would be. I have fine, relaxed hair."
1,HOAX,"On publisher's information included on a different website, this series of books was identified as ""historical fiction."" Be advised these are not actual diaries kept by the first ladies. These are concepts developed by Pamela Kay Thorson who has further turned them into scripts for a one-woman show she performs around the nation. Readers are not getting an inside look at the private thoughts of legendary women. They are reading one dramatist's idea of what the first ladies thoughts might have been.I give them one star for Ms. Thorson's dishonesty and blatant misleading of her readership."
1,Don't mess with the classics,"Children unfamiliar with the real Stan and Ollie should find this funny, but why not just turn them onto the originals instead? This film neither looks nor feels like a L&H movie-it's too noisy, too frantic, and getting mixed up with monsters was not Stan and Ollie's forte, unless you count the bogeyman in ""Babes in Toyland"". It was Abbott and Costello and The Three Stooges who tangled with monsters. The actors do a good job in impersonating Stan and Ollie, so why not just do a film biography instead? Their lives were certainly more interesting than this mess. Paul from New Jersey"
1,you have got to be kidding???,"Next thing you know, someone will try to remake ""Leave It To Beaver."" Or, ""The Little Rascals"" Wait a minute, someone already has tried those films. And with the same results as this turkey. Leave the classics alone. They can't be recreated. They are of their time and should be left alone..The only reason I give this film a one star rating is because the system wouldn't let me send the review with no stars."
3,Good...But Nowhere Near Great,"As someone who has heard PMB live on numerous occasions, I will say this: General Admission does accurately capture their sound and live playing style. It's entertaining music, and many of the songs will stick in your head. Comparisons with Dave Matthews or other well-known ""jam bands"" are, however, a bit of a stretch. PMB definitely tries to play with that degree of sophistication and depth, but lyrically and musically they rarely get past the more shallow level of catchy pop mixed with rather generic Southern ""frat rock."" Is it worth listening to? Yes, it will entertain you. Is it worth seeing PMB in concert? Yeah, it's always a fun time. Will this CD - or any of PMB's other efforts - fascinate you and challenge you as a listener? No. They lack the musical talent of a DMB or Allman Brothers Band. Those looking for unheralded Southern bands with tremendous talent should turn to people like Jupiter Coyote or Monte Montgomery."
3,Gets old fast...,"Like several other reviewers, I bought this game because it reminded me of Zuma, but for several reason I just have not gotten addicted to magnetica. You can't lay on your back to play since one hand is always holding the stylus... and the quest playing mode is never ending so after you've flicked the colored balls for 10 minutes you begin to think, ""so the point of this is... what?"" I like to think I am pretty smart, but after a certain point into puzzle mode, I just COULD NOT solve the puzzles so I hit the ""Ah, so what?"" point and turned it off. I still play Zuma on my Ipod and love it and I enjoy Luxor 2 (which works the same way) but I just didn't get into Magnetica."
4,The only other choice is almost just as good.,"If you own a CB75F and you want to resaw with a wide blade, it's either this blade, which has all carbide teeth or the other Hitachi blade with every other tooth carbide tipped. The other blade is a bit cheaper, but it does not last as long. I've had both blades professionally sharpened, and the results were decent for what it cost, but they do not cut like brand new blades. I am unaware of another manufacturer that makes blades to fit this saw, so this is what I use!"
5,Parade Of The Athletes best cd yet,this cd has to be one of the best cd's tiesto has ever recorded. as soon as i heard this cd i got hooked on him. his music is so relaxing and enjoyable i dont know how anyone can not like it. if i would have known he did this cd for the 2004 summer games i would have watched the opening ceremony. A+++ highly recomend
1,Amazon review has a spoiler. I am rating amazon!,"I was going to purchase the movie. But, the mental midgets at amazon decided to tell the public she died at age 19 in there review. Thanks for the spoiler. I guess we will watch reruns of the great ITALIAN saint movies available."
2,I thought I was buying a new product?,"I was happy to see that my tire carrier arrived in a timely manner. UNTIL I SAW THE BOX. This product was stated to be NEW...... maybe 10 years ago when it arrived at the warehouse. Then they opened it, then taped it back up, then opened, then taped, etc. etc. and it looked like it had been dropped from 40 feet up on several occasions. I can't believe the lack of care taken with this product. Unfortunatly, I need it to finish a project that has a deadline. So, it looks like I get to paint my NEW tire carrier, since it is in such shotty condition. I EXPECT MORE FROM AMAZON!"
2,not durable,"I bought these boots and wore them less than 15 times. The rubber cracked where the ball of foot bends when you walk. This made them useless as rain boots. Very cute, but if they don't do the job, what's the point?"
2,overpriced and not durable in the slightest--save your money.,"Yes, the boots are super cute and garner a comment and smile or two when wearing them out. However, when I stepped in a puddle last night and felt water sloshing over my heel only to discover that BOTH PAIRS had large rips in the back seams, they unsurprisingly weren't too adorable anymore.The real rub is that this is my second pair of these boots from Western Chief in the past three years, because I replaced the first pair for the exact same tears in the exact same place, after only wearing those for a little over a year as well. Had they been [...], I would have begrudgingly abided by the ""get what you pay for"" mantra, but for close to [...] bucks I expect a lot more durability, Western Chief."
5,a provacative challenge to conventional history,Mr Mann presents a insightful and at times provocative challenge to conventional history. His approach combines ancient lore with contemporary history to provide a fascinating backdrop for his theory. I think that all readers will find this book's account of the relationship between the Templars and modern day Masons particularly interesting and well worth reading.
2,Disappointing,"Rampant with errors. Mislabeled exercises, poorly illustrated diagrams with bad measurements, plain-old typos, and simple calculations done wrong, often several times in a row.The truth is, every math book has errors that can appear obvious when it is a rare anomaly, but when the same mistake is made over and over, it just gets confusing. On pages 50 and 51, for example, the area of a triangle is repeatedly miscalculated by dividing the base in half twice (the base should be divided once), which gives what appears to be a valid (though wrong) answer. The arithmetic is correct, but the key concept is completely botched. This is only one example of many I have spotted.I agree with other reviewers, this is more than simple oversight. For a so-called ""self-teaching guide,"" this is negligent."
4,Good book for people who know some Maya already,"This book is a great book for people who already know Maya. The author uses some sarcasim to get some of his points across, but other than that very informative. Do not get this book if you are looking for a book with Tuturials, none is provided."
3,Moderate Quality,"I believe that the show selection for this CD was excellent. However the song selection and song order were not. Why pick ""Your Daddy's Son"" from Ragtime when you can have the amazing and fantastic ""Prologue"" from the same show. Also I believe that a mistake was made by slecting ""I Don Quixote"" from Man of La Mancha instead of the much more listenable ""Impossible Dream."" Also the overture from Gypsy is not the proper song to start out a CD. Perhaps the ""Overture"" from The Phantom of the Opera.This is however an excellent example of showtunes for inexperienced members of the theatrical world."
5,Stirs Sugar Into Espresso With Long-Lasting Hope,"It's just a spoon. If that is all you need, this is exactly that. A spoon. Sleek, yes. Perfect for a quick stirring of sugar in my morning espresso. Yes. Durable, never rusting stainless steel... yes. That too. It is as adequate of an espresso spoon as can be found. Artful, yet utilitarian. Light, regular cleaning is all it needs. I use it every morning, day after day.They won't last forever, but few things do. At least, the spoons are replaceable.I took two sugars, and Nancy took one, but we stirred them just the same. We hoped we would swirl our drink for years to come, but the spoons endured longer than we did.There were four spoons. I have two. She has the other two. I only now need one. It is not just a spoon.May your espresso be sweeter when using these Tortoise Espresso Spoons.--Brockeim"
3,Mixed feelings on this one,"Does this product perform? Yes. Does the whole Fein MultiMaster system perform? Yes. Why my ambivalence? Simple - it is obscenely priced for what it does. Every time I buy a Fein product, I grit my teeth and resent the hell out of them for raking me over the coals.So if a competitor came out with an alternative that performed to the same (or similar) standards at a more reasonable price, I'd jump ship and never look back. Bottom line: it's a great tool when it comes to doing what it says it will do. It's just not even nearly worth the money, in my opinion (and I am very comfortable dropping a lot of money on good tools - I just don't see Fein delivering any real value in their pricing scheme.)"
4,Good tunes,"I just started listening to Pat McGee awhile ago when I heard kids my age talking about them coming to town. At first I wasn't too impressed with their music. It seemed too country for me, but after listening to Shine for awhile I've begun to like the band. Now I'm trying to get all their cd's. Pat McGee is really great."
2,Average,"I heard these guys for the first time in '96 in Richmond. I thought they were so-so but decided to give Revel a try. I bought Revel during the first release in '97 (I don't know where Amazon came up with 1999) to see if I missed something. I didn't. They really are pretty cheesy (I can't think of a better word). As for the sax player, he's with Agents of Good Roots now; a band where he belongs and shines. My cd has been collecting dust ever since."
2,Richard James is phat when he wants to be.,This selection is only a sample cd. I wouldn't recommend this to an ordinary aphex fan but a dj might find some use for it. If you want some nice sounds check out his others.
5,"This is the ""chill"" album",Just sooooooooo excellent. Easy listenin' music that is very well complimented with the excellent lyrics.
4,Backward clock,My son loved this and it is really making him think in order to read it backward and give the correct time. Might confuse kids just learning to tell time. Plastic face. Not good for little kids to handle. Will not withstand pressure or things being stackedon it--keep it in hands of kids who are old enough to know how to take care of it
1,bored,"Where is the music??????? it's the worst album of etnica,after the first three albums they have done only bad works and this is very boring and without sound."
2,Fun while it lasted...,"My son got this for Christmas and it broke the next day. The little lion head that holds the disks in place broke off. He wasn't rough with it, it just isn't constructed very well. It is still a fun toy, and he likes to carry it around."
1,A dud!,"I'm a big fan of Leonard's books, but this one is a dud.He breaks his own rules and gives us dull summaries of the livesof the characters right as he's trying to get the plot going,and it comes off flat. Plus, not a character that's very interesting here. Plot is uninteresting. Compared to Stick or Swag or Get Shorty, this book is just pedestrian."
2,Not as great as some people seem to think,"I agree with the reviewer from Albuquerque who says ""Killshot"" is mediocre. I've read two books by Elmore Leonard, this one and ""Maximum Bob"". Neither impressed me. They weren't awful, just not good enough to spend money and time on in my opinion. That is not how I felt after reading Raymond Chandler for instance. One thing I did get a big kick out of in ""Killshot"" is the protected witnesses being sent to live in Cape Girardeau, Missouri and hating it. Having grown up in that part of the country, believe me, that is a fate worse than being left to fend for themselves."
4,Pretty good fun.,"A cast of quirky characters as befits the Elmore Leonard tradition. Sort of ""crooks do the dumbest things."" Some of the so called good guys aren't too bright either.With one crook whose goal is to rob a bank in every state, a girl friend who is certain Elvis is still alive and a partner who feared his grandmother could turn him into an owl, the stage is set for some laughs amongst the criminal hi-jinks.The snappy Elmore Leonard dialog is here with a well paced plot. The action has a nice sensible flow.While I prefer it when Mr. Leonard sets his novels in Florida, ""Killshot"" a most pleasant escapist read. Nothing deep...just good fun and reading enjoyment. It's in the Carl Hiaasen a/o Laurence Shames vein."
5,The BEST ripper bar none!!!,"As a remodeling contractor for the past 22 years, I learned early on the value of the Lenox 6 tpi sawzall blade. I tried all the other brands in an attempt to try to save money. These blades can cut nail embedded 2x4's, galvanized water pipes and even cast iron drain pipes.... several of them before they get dull. They REALLY RIP!!!! I prefer the 12 inch length but some people like the 9"" better. I like the longer length so I can move the cutting edge along the blade to keep it cooler, therefore staying sharp longer. Don't try to substitute cheaper brands, these can't be beat. P.S. I also use a Porter Cable sawzall with quick blade change. I've had a Black and Decker Pro model, a Milwakee, Makita, and a Dewalt. The Porter Cable has a knob that changes the cutting stroke so that these blades really cut fast."
5,Major Babe......,"...one of Newman's finest, bless his heart. Paul couldn't do a bad job of acting if he tried. Dang good film."
3,Not that great,"I found this book boring. I even considered throwing it away unfinished, but I decided to push through to the end to see if it lived up to Bova's other works. It didn't. It's not enough to drive me away from him for good because some of his other books were excellent, but I was sure disappointed in this one."
2,Not what I expected,"After reading numerous blurbs about how Ben Bova's novels were a return to the ""hard"" science fiction popularized by Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke (my personal favorite), I have to say I was really let down by this book. While the science may be more or less sound, the fiction leaves much to be desired.The main problem is that Mercury is essentially a story about betrayal and vengeance that, almost as an afterthought, happens to take place on or around the planet Mercury. The main revenge plot is spelled out for the reader early on, so there's no real mystery and only a minor bit of suspense to keep the story moving.Other reviewers have stated that the book is not Bova's best, and I might be willing to give him another try. Hard sci-fi has been on life support (or maybe suspended animation?) for years. I'm just grateful that, as of this writing, we still have Arthur C. Clarke alive and still writing."
1,Horrible Audio Quality !,BEWARE !!! The 3 CD set I received has HORRIBLE audio quality.Sounds like an extremely low grade tape dub transferred to CD ! I would actually give it MINUS 5 stars if possible.George Jones IS Great but get yourself quality copies !
1,Rim-Job Dreams,"Wakefield is for people who have dreams about giving rim-jobs to donkeys. Think of a really poor, really commercial band, like Good Charlotte or New Found Glory, then throw away any scraps of talent that those bands MIGHT have. What you have left is Wakefield. They're just jumping on the current band-wagon of bad, mall-punk bands."
2,Instructions don't mention XP. Neither does their web site.,"The instructions don't mention Windows XP. The web site mentions it, barely, but wihhout instructions. I wasted an hour trying to do it myself, then an hour with tech support. Finally got it working, but only because I know about IP addresses, network configuration, etc. I imagine it would be easy to setup if they bothered to provide instructions for WIndows XP, and it may be easy with older versions of Windows. But XP users should stay away. And wonder why NetGear can't provide any attempt at instructions a year after XP's release.Once I got it working, it works fine. The only hassle was setting it up."
4,Great addition...,We had been waiting a long time for this. We wanted the multiplayer version so bad. In this version comes some great levels even one where you can play paintball games. The only thing I dont like about this type of game is that it is a little violent for kids but its great for a teen or adult who likes the first person shooters.
1,A voice from the Seventies,"Right... the 'Joy of Sex' covers mainly the technicalities and the author doesn't go on very much about psychology etc, although it shines through. 'More Joy' is heavily about psychology, on the contrary... it may have been necessary when the book was puslished (early seventies) and may be again necessary now... the book clearly shows its age... and if his views don't agree with your personality (he does get preachy at times) the book is not for you."
4,"Lydia, Lydia, Lydia",Life is just like candy and this album is really good ear-candy. It's a wonderland of electronica goodness that shouldn't be missed if you're into pop-like chillness.
5,Stamp Art Inspirations with MaryJo McGraw,"This DVD is packed with a lot of techniques and a gallery of examples. Mary Jo is a great teacher. With the DVD, she is right in your home!"
4,Liked it,This offered some new ideas was very easy to use and gave clear instuctions for completing the idea
3,"better than most, not as good as some","final effort of one of the best bands ever. look for mark and franks new band "" ALL SYSTEMS GO! "" coming to a town near you!!"
5,Variety of recipes and servings and very easy to read,"One of the things I like about this cookbook is that it has recipes with different numbers of servings instead of just recipes for 2 or 4 or 6 people. Most are for 1, 2 or 4 servings and they tell you whether it is easy to double or half them for more or less people. There are many recipes to choose from and they are easy to follow. I have made several and they turned out great and I am not the most talented cook in the world LOL!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Kindle version. I have no trouble navigating around and finding recipes. However, this version has no nutritional information, thus rendering it pretty useless for a diabetic. I can't even find a place to contact anyone to complain!"
2,Fantastic for one-time use.,"You know that terrible feeling you get when you're chewing a delectable piece of the best, most premium burger you've ever had, and suddenly you hit a splinter of bone that pulls you straight back to reality?Now you can have that feeling with everything you ever put grated cheese on! I second (third....fifth?) the other reviewers who note that this grater grates well - for a little while - until the clear plastic degrades into an array of shards delicately clinging to the metal grater they once held.I never washed mine in the dishwasher, or dropped it, or manhandled it, and the clear plastic has degraded to the point that it does indeed dropinvisible pieces of plastic in the food as you grate.Again, I can't recommend it."
5,Microplane,"Microplane always deliver. Soft handle grip, great sharp grater, have a few different ones and they are all good and a must for the kitchen."
2,"Great grating surface, poor handle design","I had this grater for about a month before I noticed a hairline crack in the clear plastic between the grating surface and the rubber handle. Over time the crack grew to the point where it finally split. It took two years and about once a week's worth of use before it happened, but last night the handle broke off while grating some parmesan. I knew it was going to happen eventually, so I was always cautious when grating cheeses. Figured I'd get as much time with it as possible before replacing it with a Microplane Pro version.If it wasn't for the handle issue, I'd have given it five stars. The grating surface was razor sharp and worked quite well."
5,Great Gadget!,"A simple, inexpensive, well-designed, smooth handling, quality product that grates hard cheese effortlessly. I love my new grater!"
3,Not as Good as People Make out,"The best track on this album is definitely Pressure, with it's morphing and shifting sounds from ambient, electronica, dense mixing and beats. The rest of the album is fairly disappointing compared to Pressure and not what I was expecting. I don't think I will buy any more by this artist but it's not as bad as other CD's I have purchased. The other good tracks are Floatilla and Ping Pong which are fairly good ambientish tracks.It's not really an ambient CD - if your looking for that buy The Orb - Adventures in The Ultraworld, Brian Eno - Apollo, The Starseeds - A Parallel life and Future Sound of London - Lifeforms. The latter is what I term 'dark' ambient, whereas The Orb is definitely lighter, floaty and chilled out"
4,"Good bands, great covers..",This CD is a great compilation of some classic and some not so well known Cro-Mags songs. Choppy production but that only adds to the brutality. Truly has that old school sound. English hardcore bands at their finest. Well worth the price and a great addition to a Cro-Mags fan's collection.
4,Generally good.,"Not as high level as I would have liked, but generally a good book. Pictures are black and white, not so good for geology."
4,Granddaughter's Christmas present,My granddaughter received a keyboard for her birthday (Oct 2012) and I followed up with the bench and keyboard lessons. Shr was tickled with both
2,"beautiful kitty, she just didn't care for it","I chose this cat as a special gift from the ""bobo fairy"" (pacifier fairy) when we weaned our daughter off the pacifier at two, since she is wild about our pet cat. All the bobos were collected and left outside her bedroom door before bedtime and in the morning the bobo fairy had left her a beautiful kitty in their place. She made the transition to life post-bobo very well though this kitty had nothing to do with it. It is beautiful but she just didn't care about it in the least. It's been a year and she still doesn't really play with it, it just sits in her room. My mistake was washing it to freshen it up. Now it's nappy beyond repair which is my own fault since I knew it shouldn't go in the washing machine but put it in there anyway. Even though my daughter didn't care for it, I think it is a beautiful kitty and it's likability is strictly dependent on the child for whom it is intended."
4,Not bad!,"I'm surprised this hasn't been reviewed yet. These are pleasant concertos... The back of the CD compares them to the Brandenburg Concertos, and though they aren't perhaps on that level, they are similar in that they are composed for diverse instruments -- oboes, bassoons, and flutes in addition to the usual strings, with organ on the very last track. My favorites are the first in B flat and the third in G. The last movement of the last concerto is an early version of a movement of one of his organ concertos, so if you have heard them, it will be familiar. In fact, if you liked the Water Music or the organ concertos, you will like this."
4,chair,"I bought this chair to use to be able to load my wheelchair into my truck.I am an amputee need something sit on to load my chair, its very stable."
3,It's ok,The back could be taller. The bar across the top makes it uncomfortable unless you sit upright or slouch down a little to avoid it. No padding. Just canvis. It's ok just not what I was really looking for.
3,Thomas and Sarah,"Adventures of Thomas, the cunning Welsh chauffeur from Upstairs Downstairs and Sarah, the mischievous cockney parlow maid. They are real life husband and wife. Story picks up after they have left the Bellamy house. Seven tapes of their adventures both in and out of money. Good supporting cast. Cons that work for a while -- always end up broke. Sarah having her way with not going to America and a half dozen stories of their adventures. Enjoyable BUT the ending is a letdown. After all their adventures you think the ending would be something better than it was. Most annoying."
5,Great Read,"I loved this book - it is very conservative which I like, and it gives a clear picture of the good old days. More children now days should be raised to fear the Lord."
3,Disappointing Message,"Art Blakey's album ""A Jazz Message"" is not one of the excellent recordings that so many have come to expect from this pioneering drummer. Blakey, known best as leader of the Jazz Messengers, here finds himself in a quartet session for his (then) label Impulse. Joining him are fellow labelmates Sonny Stitt, McCoy Tyner and Art Davis, and they basically sound like they are fulfilling a contract. Both of Blakey's Impulse albums (the other being ""Jazz Messengers"") are rather mediocre affairs, and those knew to this drumming/bandleading genius would be much better served exploring his Blue Note discography (not a bad one in the bunch), his Atlantic album with Thelonious Monk, or his mid 60's efforts on OJC. This is ""A Jazz Message"" that can be deleted."
5,LAST GROUP,"Art's next to last recording session 2/90 is a 70 min. all out swinging affair with an octet worth of musicians. There's Brian Lynch trumpet,Dale Barlow and Javon Jackson tenor saxes,Frank Lacy and Steve Davis trombones. Geoff Keezer is the pianist. Most of the originals wre written by younger Messengers but Hammerhead goes back to Wayne Shorter and FREE FOR ALL. They did another one minus Lacy a couple of months later with ballad features for Lynch, Barlow,Jackson and Keezer- ONE FOR ALL- 4/90- 68 min."
4,very good burner,hardley ever lose cd's on my desktop. But seemed to lose a few on my labtop before upgrading to a more powerful computer. When opening other programs it is outstanding. Can run the internet or office and still burn.
4,The right tool makes this fiddly job easy,"Excellent little tool for removing those pesky spring bars. If you've ever tried to install and replace a watch band using a pocketknife, you know how annoying and difficult a project that should be simple can be. This tool works well and makes that simple project simple - both taking the old band off and installing the new one. No home should be without one."
2,Cheap tool,"It is very cheap, so don't be disappointed when it breaks. I read a review before I bought it, warning that it would break, so I bought 2. The tip of my first one broke the first time I used it. You may be better off paying a bit more and getting a better tool. If you plan to use it once, this may be good enough. If you like changing your bands often, look elsewhere."
3,"ok, but not very durable","This tool is ok, it is good for removing straps. I bought it to remove a numebr of straps. After a week of use, maybe ten or so straps, the pointy end was worn down. For the price it is ok but you might want to order two if you are doing lots of work - also the shipping prices for such a small item seemed exessive."
1,"Flimsy , poor construction.","I received the product in a timely manner and I was eager to put it to use. The ""pin"" side immediately bent when I gently used it remove a loose pin from my watchband. I tried to gently bend it straight again and the pin just broke off. I think the steel used to build this tool is of very poor, cheap quality. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
2,one side works,"I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch. The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead. Maybe there's a ""knack"" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing.The pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small, recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. But you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver, the point of a phillips head...)"
2,Broken after 2 uses,"First time I used the tool on a Citizen Eco-Drive watch band. It worked great when I resized the band. The second time I used it on a Seiko Jubilee watch band. The pins on the Seiko watch band were much tighter than the Citizen watch band. I had to remove two links, which meant 4 pins had to be removed. I bent the tip of the tool on the second pin and it progressively got worse on each subsequent pin until the tip broke off. Don't feel too bad since it didn't cost very much."
2,deceptive web page,"Do not be fooled by the picture. There is NO T-connector in this particular package. This is a simple plug in for Xterras already equipped with Tow package. No where on the web page does it tell you this. You can order the same thing much cheaper from other manufacturers. You must hunt down info on Curt Connectors yourself on the web to find all of this info, or order it and be very dissappointed, like myself."
2,corduroy vhs,I like to get vhs that follow the books. Not really a good one. I was disappointed. I thought this would be animated or follow the artwork from the book. Skip it. Get the book & read to your child.
2,good but not as expected,My daughter only watches the corduroy story but not the bonus stories. She is only familiar with the illustrated version of corduroy and was hoping to see curduroy interacting with his buddies from the books we have. She loves the very hungry caterpillar and watches it often.
4,smells well,I just find it with my friend's recommendation.It smells well and I like it.I will recommend it to other friends...
1,It is fake!,I use Coco Chanel perfume for many years. I know how it looks and smells. The one I recently purchased from Amazon is a cheap knock off for the price of the real thing. I will never buy any designer product from Amazon again since apparently they cannot properly screen their vendors.
2,Who ever heard of an 19th century heroine called Breanna?,"Maybe I'm being too picky, but I get tired of suspending disbelief with romances. A note to Kane: no one in the 19th century would have been named Breanna! It's a misspelled version of a name that would likely have been spelled Briana, if it was used at all in that time period. She's named her characters straight off the top 10 list of 1999. The names of the heroine's children are also utterly unrealistic. Holly? Quinn? The heroines' characters are also overly modern. Liberated women of a certain type didn't exist then. Read Mary Balogh or Amanda Scott, two authors with characters who are a touch more believable. This book does have all the required elements -- romance, sex, a touch of danger -- though Kane's language and plot is sugary. ""Precious"" is obviously her favorite word."
4,"Awesome grater, plastic frame, not so much!","Love these graters - but don't love replacing them when the plastic frame inevitably breaks. Upgraded to the ""professional"" series for the metal frame. Once the plastic frame breaks the zester is pretty much done. I did also order the frameless fine rasp to see how that works as well. To be fair the plastic frame lasted through 7 or 8 years of frequent use, including getting tossed into the dishwasher. Treat yourself to fresh zest, grated ginger paste & grated nutmeg without even thinking twice!"
2,"Blade great, plastic handle snaps off easily","I heard rave reviews about Microplane blades, and I wasn't disappointed in the zester. I purchased three: coarse, fine, and medium, and ALL THREE handles have snapped off, so I am left with 3 virtually useless sharp blades. What a bummer and waste of money, poor design. I would not recommend or buy the plastic handle versions again. Totally disappointing."
4,5 stars for grater 2 for plastic holder,"I am on my third grater and will not be replacing it with the same model. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the ones with plastic handles. The graters themselves are WONDERFUL. They stay sharp and do a great, consistent job, but the plastic handles break. None of mine lasted a year, but I love the Microplane so will hunt for one with a metal frame."
4,Shedding New Light on Baby Abandonment,This is a fascinating story that was difficult to put down. It may be helpful to women in deciding on adoption or abortion.
4,Plenty of ideas,"Surprisingly good book. Many different ways to construct a sweater -- from the top, bottom, cuff-to-cuff, with & without seams, etc. Just don't be put off by the older style photos and color combinations. I'll be keeping this book."
1,Was totally surprised!,"I was very disappointed in this book. The book was very wordy and I skipped pages with no problems at all. Don't want to be a drag, but I couldn't keep this book on my shelf much less read the whole thing. I have read other books by Judith Pella that were much better. I would recommend The Belles of Lowell series but not this book."
5,Good for teaching fractions too!,Nice toy and once my kids are older and it's age appropriate I will write these fractional segments to teach fractions and parceling. Great toy!
4,"cute for play, not very well made","This is really cute and my 17 month old daughter loves to ""cut"" her fruit. After a month of use, the paint is chipping off."
5,really neat,We got Mellisa and Doug food items and this really neat fruit crate. These are great toys that teach kids there's more to eating then opening a hamburger wrapper ( although I do like my burgers).
5,fruit,My girls love this (3 and 4). But so foes every kid that has come over to play. Very happy with this product.
4,Great for practicing cutting.,"I got this for my granddaughter. She started using it around her 2nd birthday. She loved being able to ""cut"" fruits. In the beginning, I had to put them back together so she could ""cut"" them up again but now( at 2 1/2 years old) she can put them back together by herself."
4,We love this toy!,"First of all, I feel that I should say the only reason I went searching for reviews of this toy was to find instructions on how to change it to the tower mode as it's not obvious and I'm shocked that there are so many negative reviews! I bought this toy at a carboot for 4 with all the pieces and my 3 and a half year old son thinks it's amazing! It really is! It makes noises and has flashing lights and there's so much space for imaginative play. Also, the secret compartment is great for hiding your little sister's biscuit!"
1,this is a horrible toy,My son got this as a gift and I am going to take it back. Nothing fits together and the directions are so small I cannot read them even with a magnifying glass. There is no way to contact the company either. It is very poorly constructed and the pictures on the box are very misleading. Do not waste you money on this piece of junk.
2,The second-worst Jack Game,"The first-worst is of course Volume 2 because of Buzz, but the host is not the cause of the horribleness of this game (schmitty's cool). The problem is, it's too slow. What's up with that, on the ride, it seemed to go through 13 questions BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. But however many questions it has, it goes through them BOOM------BOOM------BOOM, and that isn't normal Jack. It's Redeaming quality is the internet play. They did such a great job on that. If they can keep that being good while still having a fast-paced trivia game, it would be better."
2,Some good some bad,"I found this book to be terrible when I was looking for something specific, but good if read from the start to finish of each chapter. My style of studying doesn't mesh well with the book's lack of a useful index and procedural organization within the text. The index is useless because common, major terms refer to pages that almost exclusively off-handedly mention the term with no further explanation. This organization makes it nearly useless as a reference book."
4,Stop whining about Crude Clay,"This stuff works just as good. The consistency is a little diff from Crude Clay... but they work about 95% the same.It might seem semi-pricey to some, but in the salon its MUCH more expensive... and that's IF you can find it. Also, good hair product is expensive (in most cases).If you want something not too greasy, gives great volume and styles your hair the way you want it (I have a faux-hawk); this stuff works great! Put a little hairspray after your done styling, and your ready for the evening."
2,50% Effective,"I bought 2 of these, and one of them stopped working after 2 months for no apparent reason. The light still comes on, but it does not charge the phone. Another annoyance is that it needs to be firmy and almost forcefully pushed into the cigarette lighter adapter. The slightest movement can loosen it, and you won't know until you find later that your phone is not charged. Like many other cell phone accessories, with this one you get what you pay for when you go with generic non-OEM products."
3,Fairly Smelly,This perfume package smells very strong. I like the one that is very mild and mellow. The other two are very strong and you almost don't want tos pray it but rather dab it.
5,Tony Martin,"Been looking for this collection all my life. Growing up in the forties and fifties, this is the music and voice by which I counted the days of my youth as I listened to it on WSB Radio, in Atlanta. This collection contains all my favorites, and they evoque the many memories associated with them. I sit back, listen, and see my youthful past."
3,"See it, just see for yourself!!","In spite of this being a very serious movie about a serious time in history, it is not without some light moments...one of which I am still surprised got left in the final version! Like, when they have just made Love a few minutes before and she says ""let's do it again and this time leave IT in me!""Everything the other people have said is true and my advice is to watch it & judge for yourself! You won't be disaapointed."
1,Junk,This is a very poor design. The sides broke almost immediately and I had to fix them with tape. Later the left just stopped working completely. I use them in an office and am not rough on them. Just junk.
4,Great headset.,"The sound quality oif this Yamaha headphone is twice as good as its replacement and the cord length is much longer which best suits my needs. I would highly recommend it as a very good deal for its price. Quite frankly, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality."
3,Portable Headphones,"The heaphone does seem to need to be charged frequently, even when it is not used much during the day. It is okay for what I need it for, but am not sure how someone needing it all day would do, as it is not of the greatest quality. Sorry, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Lil Milton,"I was so disappointed in this CD, don`t even sound ike the Lil Milton I listen to. I`ve followed him for years ans years, concerts, Blues festivals, albums,cassettes,Cd`,s etc. But I can`t even listen to this anymore. A waste of money,Sorry!! Mary Specks"
4,crazy about tamagotchi,"I find this toy fun but the battery run out pretty fast, but I play with it all the time. Its a very neat toy and I recommended to all the girls."
4,Leave the Lights On!,"This is an entertaining series. Done in a news magazine style each tape takes a look at a different region or different type of haunting. Since each tape covers a wide range of hauntings, only a few stories are with any sort of depth on each tape. There are a few stories that I wish that they would have delved deeper into and that is one of the reasons I took off a star and because of the last tape. The last tape in the series is a historical look at folklore all over the world and seems really out of place. I think serious ghost hunters might be disappointed but someone just starting out getting into ghostly legends and stories will really enjoy it...just skip the last tape."
4,its good but not the best sub i ever heard,its god but not the best sub i ever heard. the price is good. go for it. rock your neighbors they love it
4,Did the Trick!,"Well, there's not much to this little guy, but it did the trick and was an exact replacement for the original. After replacing this mount and the right mount, my 150,000-mile car idled as smooth as glass. I am quite pleased with the results of the maintenance, especially given the low cost (~$34 for both parts) and the time involved (about 30-45 minutes total).My car is a 1998 Ford Escort LX with the 2.0L engine."
5,No Way But God's Way,"This is one outstanding man with an outstanding history with Christ and evil. In Russ's book, you are taking his journey of family abuse, substances, crime, prision with no end to despire. What you will find is what Russ found... that Christ never lets go of anyone, even if you don't know who Christ is. This book is not for anyone person, it is a story for all to be inspired that God is with us all the way. There is no other way.I bought this book after hearing Russ Simon Jr. as a speaker at a school I work at. If you ever get the chance, please hear his message. It is not religous or about dysfunctional families or substance abuse or just another speaker's great story...it is the truth about lies. This is a must for parents and children of all ages. Thank you Russ!"
4,Very good CD,"This nofx album is really, not their best but it's got some powerful and catchy songs like the separation of church and skate. Just buy it, don't think about it too much."
1,Music Good...Politics Bad!,"I just wish they would keep their political ideals out of there music. I think their music is great but I can't stand their views on many things. They'd be much better if they stuck to what they do best...making punk music, not preaching politics!"
1,Are these fools for real?,The singer sounds way Gay and so do the lyrics. Really childish music for childish anti-american rejects. In my opinion I think that this whole band along with the cowards who love them so much should be deported out of the U.S if they hate it so much. All I have to say is very immature and pathetic.
5,NOFX came through again.,This is one of the best punk cd's I have ever listened to. It is pure punk rock. I think it my be their best album. I am 13 years old and these guys have been my favorite band for a wile now. So if you like punk music don't forget to pick this up. I love all the songs on this cd but my favorite is the seperation of church and skate.
4,Decent,"I didnt know what to give this CD. It's a good CD but its definantly not the best NoFx cd. I like Punk in Drublic and Heavy Petting Zoo the best...but this is a good CD. Some songs are more poppy, some are faster, some have ska. It's a mix of a lot of things. The political message is kind of blah but i respect it. Songs such as The Idiots are Taking Over and Whoops I O'D are great songs. If your looking for older NoFx, this is not a good Cd to get...but if u are looking for a more poppy and better sounding CD then this is for u. It is also a CD you can only listen to so many times before it gets boring."
1,New cd,"this cd is terrible, i have no idea what happened, nofx used to be so good up until pump up the valuum and then this, the only songs worth listening to are franco-un american and the idiots are taking over"
3,It's alright,"I thought it was gonna be pretty cool when I heard the first song, but then it just got too poppy. It has some pretty good songs but, it just sounds bad, and I don't like some of their views like in ""The Idiots Are Taking Over"". The biggest reason is that they have way better albums like Punk In Drublic, WT2H&B, Ribbed, and Pump Up The Valuum. If you want a good NOFX album i'd get one of the ones I mentioned, not this one."
2,mmmm__what's happening???,"OK kids, this album is nice, but nothing more, the lyrics, like everybody has just said are great but the music.... This is medio-core, the only stand-outs are We got two jealous and Reagaining Unconsciousness. Oh, once a guy called Fat Mike told and sung ""we don't play ska anymore"", well what's about anarchy camp???? That trumpet seems a sample of Sapore di mare, an italian song from the 60's. Embarassing. But in the end, what can I say, also the boring music is done with style, and nofx does it, probably because their music is in my heart..so....LET's HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE or just look to a great PAST."
5,I love these in my bread.,I make bread machine bread and have a recipe for a whole grain bread that calls for ground flaxseeds and whole sunflower seeds. It is my favoite bread and I use these seeds for that. It's great.
4,Good Phone BUT ...,"I loved the large buttons however the quality of reception has much room for improvement. At times the phone fades in and out during a conversation and makes you think you were cut off -- yet you weren't ... it's just the bad reception of the phone. Overall it's not a bad phone, in fact one of the better phones I've owned. Just wanted others to be aware of the reception problem."
4,Great Movie!!!,I purchased this movie for my father for Christmas. He has always loved this movie and has been waiting for it to be released in color. Amazon states it's in color but BE AWARE!!! it's the original recording in black in white. I still gave it 4 stars because its a great holiday movie for the family.
3,Finally all of the episodes,"As the previous reviewer said, this is the same set as the previous release with the exception of 4 additional episodes not included originally. This addition completes the series. If you bought the old set and are a completist you will have to buy this for the missing 4 episodes. Kind of a screw job."
4,Why Great Leaders Don't Take Yes for an Answer,"I believe this book should be read by any leader looking to make smart informed decisions. This book by itself will not lead to any earth shattering discovery's, but couple it with Stephen Coveys - 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and possibly the 4 Roles of Leadership and you have the makings to become a great leader and an informed decisions maker. The examples used in the book were not only relative, but interesting to know some facts behind major events in our history. I recommend this book to anyone faced with challenges while collecting information from staff, peers, superiors or customers in the pursuit of finding answers to make an informed knowledgeable decision."
5,Nice phone - solid reception.,"I have recently bought two of these phones and, while I've not tried them out in water yet, they function quite well. My only complaint was somewhat with the lack of documentation on the handset phone. The directions aren't clear as to how you link a remote phone to the base. On the base unit there is a button on the bottom that you use to link them. Once I figured it out they work fine. I really like the intercom feature."
1,Modern Masonry manual,I recently purchased this book but it was not what I thought. This book is a practice manual but when I ordered it the display stated that it was a textbook.
2,"Choppy, redundant, and full of errors","In many sections this book lacks a smooth flow of writing. Paragraphs often feel like poorly ordered lists rather than leading from one idea to the next. This is especially true in Chapter 4's description of the Pthreads API.Much space is dedicated to describing the Pthreads API, both in Chapter 4 and again in Appendix B. Most systems with Pthreads installed have man pages that already supply this information but with fewer errors (for example, see p. 150).Some of the code examples seem like they were added in a hurry. They are incomplete, not in the sense of omitting implementation details but because they lack basic C++ syntax (e.g., types). If they were intended as language-independent pseudocode this would make sense, but the book is ostensibly about C++. For example, see Examples 4.11.1 and 5.3.1.A better source for practical tools for parallel programming is Patterns for Parallel Programming by Mattson."
4,Wrong title,"I think that the book is quite good. However, do not look architecture level concepts, neither mathematics, neither an explanation of distributed and parallel concepts (well, there is something...). The title shoudl be something like ""C++ tools for distributed and parallel programming""However, this is the only book I know that introduces the biggest amount of tools in other to implement distributed applications in C++ (in case you do not want to start from sctach). Of course, there are missing thinks like web services, sockets, peer2peer middlewares, etc. However, the explained packages are the most used in the market."
3,A GOOD EFFORT WITH GOOD ARRANGEMENTS AND GOOD TIGHT STUDIO MUSICIANS.,I REALLY WOULD SAY 3 AND A HALF STARS. TIGHT MUSIC WITH WALTER HAWKINS PRODUCING SOME OF THE TRACKS. THIS IS I WOULD SAY IS A GOOD EFFORT WITH SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE WHO WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING THAT THE MAINSTREAM GOSPEL AUDIENCE WONT REALLY CARE TOO MUCH FOR. I WOULD SAY NOT THE BROTHERS BEST RELEASE BUT IN THE TOP 5.
5,A sentimental favorite,"I purchased this book after seeing ""The Man Who Saved Christmas"" on TV in December. My older brother, now in his 60's, was a huge erector set fan as a kid and grew up to be an engineer. He said he actually remembered Gilbert's name from the ouside of the set's box! Anyway, he really got a kick out of the book. Gilbert's true-life story is remarkable and particularly inspiring for those of us who grew up in the Kennedy days of trying to be the ""best and the brightest."" It also would make a great gift for any academically inclined young person."
4,Nice book,I enjoyed the TV secial many years ago and wanted to know more aboutthe life and times of AC Gilbert. I loved the science and chemesrty sets of my child hood. This is a great book if you like company and biographies. This is a great addition to the American Flyer Model train collectors libary. I bought it for my brother who used to be an American Flyer fan ( I was into Lionel). I kept the book - maybe I will get him one for next year!
1,really bad cd,don't buy this crap it's not tech n9ne it's don juan tech n9ne only appears in a freestyle at the end of the cd this is a falsely advertised product i was pissed when a don juan cd came in the mail when i wanted a tech n9ne cd!
5,Chayanne - Muy Caliente,This is a great CD. Otra Vez is my all time favorite Chayanne song followed very closely by La Playa and Refugio De Amor.
4,"This is really good, and I dont even like the guy!","I believe track one is one of the best song ever written in spanish, I mean is beautiful, and don't think I'am a fan of this guy, this is my first and only cd of this guy but has 3 or four songs worth buying it, and as for ""lo dejaria todo"" is by itself a worthy cd."
4,Like the cd,This cd has a good variety of songs on it. There are some nice cute dance ones and some nice slow songs. Chayanne is good. This cd is worht it. Iknow I have over 50 latino cds.
4,Good 1st Fishing game,"This is an interesting twist from the creators of Deer Avenger. Normally I don't care for fishing games but I thought what's the harm in trying something new. It is so cool! Funny dialogue, hysterical lures to get the fisherman in. Kinda hard the first couple of times since I have never played a fishing game before but gets much easier as you learn the ropes. I hope Bass Avenger 2 is half as good as the first."
3,good for awhile,"At the beginning, this game is very fun and exciting. The Bass's wisecracks and baits used to catch the fisherman are hilarious. After awhile you learn which baits to use for every different kind of fisherman and soon enough you have caught all the different ""species."" The problem with this is once you match the bait and fisherman it gets really easy to catch them which makes the game extremely boring."
5,Wondeful,"I love this grater. It really shows nutmeg who's the boss. However, don't get over-confident and think you can use this for cinnamon. Cinnamon has to be ground professionally. I would also recommend using a larger model for ginger, if you have one.Easy clean up, I just toss mine in the dishwasher."
5,Love this tool!,"I love this grater. It's small, lightweight and easy to hold. I use it to grate ginger. Unlike other graters, when I tap this one, all the grated ginger falls right out. It comes with a plastic cover which protects both the grater so it won't dull as well as my hands when I reach into the drawer for another tool."
2,very unhappy,I would not recommend this product. It is cheaply made and flimsy. I purchased another one from the supermarket for a few dollars less and the quality is way better.
4,Very helpful,"I consult this guide whenever I take any backroad trips. Forget online map services, they only display the destination and maybe little in between. This is a very useful map for my needs"
3,"Exspected bitterness ,Got honesty","Had heard of this book for awhile and thought id give it a try.Turns out any and all negative impressions i had harboured prior to reading it were ill founded.Martha comes across as a very open and honest women, who faced her grief and used it to ultimatly gain a level of justice for he Husband.Her dislike for all things relating to wrestling is clear , but she still attempted to research the subject ( and at times failed to correctly relay the facts ) and came across as being at the very least informed .Will no doubt find an excuse to re read it again ."
3,Didn't help me much,"The guy holds his hands out to find where the drums talk from, then places a really expensive mic there. Not very practical. Mostly focuses on just comparing low mid and high cost mics and how the high cost ones sound better in the same position.I watched it a couple times. I tried to feel where drums talk from, but I can't do that. It would have been nice if he described what that means. Or perhaps it's BS.This video did help me understand the importance of the room (ambience) mic though. Especially if its a $5000 Manley."
2,This card is nothing more than a MMC,"This card is nothing more than a MultiMediaCard (MMC). There are many options out there for purchasing MMC. Also, SecureDigital (SD) cards are fully compliant with the Palm Pilots for which this memory card is being marketed. At the time of writing this review, this was among the most expensive of comparable cards. In fact, yesterday at a local retailer I saw a 512MB (4x the capacity) for five dollars more.So my advice is that you do purchase expansion cards to take full advantage of the power of your Palm. I have purchased many and am able to use my Palm as an MP3 player (using RealOne), a video player (using Kinoma), an atlas (using Mapopolis) and a video game system (using PalmOne Sega Classic cards and downloaded games) all at the same time. Do buy SD or MMC cards to expand, but I would encourage you to comparison shop, looking for better prices.-Jacob Hantla"
1,i want on plase 2,hi its me angain thanx 4 restalking but if u can can u make shure that all the new york toysrus stores are foll wit the storwes please and thanx u
4,"Tamagotchi ver3, if you're still searching, don't give up!","These toys are great, tiny, and lots of fun! My sister got some for christmas and I have beeen hunting for them ever since. I don't know how Santa got his hands on them, but he is GOOD! They have been sold out since early December! I think bandai should at least supply enough to satisfy people, they're so hard to find! But there's hope, all you searchers out there! I have 2 tamas dancing around right beside me, thanks to my sis and wonderful dad (thanks papa!) who found them at toys r us. Online is sold out, so that's a lost cause, but in your local stores, you're bound to find one eventually! Just keep trying!Signed,a happy new tama owner :)"
1,1 star because of the copy protection,1 star for the copy protection.How can you rate the music on it if you can't listen to it?Idiots.
1,If you own an IPOD buy this album on itunes,"I wouldn't know if this cd is good or not. I haven't been able to listen to it. It's a lot of trouble to authenticate a cd I bought, waste a cd burning it on to ANOTHER cd I'm not going to use just to get it on my ipod. It's a shame too, I'm sure this cd is great. If I see the anti-piracy sticker again, I'll just get it on itunes or live without it."
1,WARNING: NOT PLAYABLE ON MP3s COPYWRITED,I liked the song club foot so I bought the CD. HUGE MISTAKE. The CD has some sort of copywrite protection such that it cannot be played on IPOD or other MP3 players (I use an iRiver and it didn't work). It is really annoying-you cannot make any copies even for legitimate reasons like keeping a copy in your car (and just trying to play the CD with a computer is a pain in the butt). I think Kasabian sucks for copping out and letting RCA dictate how I should use a CD that I own. It is like GM selling you a car and telling you that you cannot drive it in Canada!?!
5,Turn sibling arguing into sibling laughter,I am a mother of 5 boys and they are always running around and fighting each other. This book cut that out! When I pull this book out and just randomly choose a game it never a wrong game. The kids love it! Children sometimes just don't know how to play together and they need a little guidance. Parents sometimes don't have the right answer to the problem but I believe this book solves that problem! My kids favorite game is the one when you have one foot in the air and u hold one hand with a partner and the first person to fall lose. They play that over and over again without even pulling out the book! This book is fool of ideas to make you house less noisy from arguing and crying to laughter and fun.I recommend this book for sure!
1,Peculiar Pain,"I find it peculiar that women go to work like they are dressed for a party or some other ""fanciful activities"", then they become upset when men treat them like less than ladies. I know the author and she is no lady..."
4,Not as bad as everyone thinks,"The film really isn't a bad film- sure it starts off on a bad note, but it does pick up. It is true that the best part about the film is Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- even in his younger days he was still a very believable actor. At first when I heard his accent, I was thinking ""Oh no...,"" but when he's actually on camera for his longer scenes, you suddenly forget that he's as American as anyone, and has no real accent.Without a doubt, this is a shining moment of young Gordon-Levitt's career (for later standouts, see Forever Lulu, aka Along for the Ride, Sweet Jane, and Manic). Too bad the movie wasn't a little bit better (but it's really not bad)."
4,GO PATRICIA ARQUETTE,"It was really funny. Particia Arquette and Joseph Gordan-Levitt are wonderful. It had a great story, good acting, over-all it was cool. Rated PG-13 for: Language, Adult Situations, and brief nudity."
5,Great Zester!,I've been wanting a zester for quite awhile and I finally decided on this one after plenty of reviewing of others here on amazon. This product is excellent! The amount of zest I got from one little orange was crazy!! It's very easy to use and even comes with a plastic cover to keep your fingers save when it is stored in the drawer. I highly recommend that you get this if you're sitting on the fence and aren't sure. You won't reget it-I know I don't!
5,My most favorite kitchen tool!,"My most favorite kitchen tool and I have many many kitchen gadgets.This grater/zester is the best! It is to die for! I use it every day. I love it. I love lemon, and this makes grating lemon rind a breeze. It is perfect for parmesan cheese. I can't say enough good things about it. It is easy to use, and easy to clean."
5,"Grate, Grate, Grate Your Cheese Gently Down the Stream","I use the microplane grater/zester every day, in many ways. Besides the obvious choice of grating cheese on Italian food- I bake my veggies in the oven with a little olive oil, salt and pepper in a 400 degree oven for 20 mins. Using the microplane I grate some parmaegianno on top- yum, yum, yum- and low fat. Zest lemons, oranges and limes- easily said and easily done. Do not zest or grate your knuckles which in some cases can be easy to do-bend your hand so that your knuckles do not display. Safety at all times. The microplane is very affordable, easy to use and you will ask yourself- why didn't I buy one before this? Helpful hint- a wonderful stocking stuffer!"
2,Nothing to get excited about,"Ever since I read in the NYT last year that the microplane zester is one of the three ""must haves"" for serious cooks, I have wanted one, especially since I was thrilled with the other two (the Oxo peeler and Silpat), but so far I'm disappointed with it. It has few advantages over my $3 grocery store small-hole grater for zesting citrus or grating ginger. It's slightly better in that it doesn't release as many liquids from what you are grating, but that may be a disadvantage because you end up needing to grate more for the same flavor. It's worse in that bits of what you are grating build up on the edges, which are slightly folded over, so you have to go at them with a toothpick, which is tedious.It's not that I don't recognize a hierarchy of graters --- once I bought one at a dollar store which was clearly inferior to my $3 grocery grater --- I just don't think this one is much better than the basic type."
4,Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater,"Hard to love a hand kitchen tool, but we do like this one. Makes those kitchen chores that much easier. Wish we had gotten one sooner as we would not have had as many scraped fingers."
4,great grater,"This is a great grater/zester. I found it particularly good for zesting citrus - so easy to do and it doesn't take off any of the bitter pith. Like using it for parmesan too, although I find the hard cheese slips along the grater a bit fast and I keep scraping my fingertip on the thing. Haven't tried it much with vegetables yet, but am so pleased with the way it works on lemons and limes that it's been worth the price already."
5,Indispensable Kitchen Tool,"I was amazed at the performance of this grater. Nutmeg, which is usually difficult and dangerous to grate, was a snap. Hard cheeses were no contest for this tool and the grated cheese was very light and fluffy. As an added bonus, clean up is easy and there are no skinned knuckles to show for it. I would rate this as second only to my food processor and an absolute must in any serious cook's kitchen."
1,HOLES TOO SMALL TO BE A GRATER!!!,This microplane reduces everything to juicy dust. No small grated pieces. The holes are just way too small. Arrived fast though.
3,Good for the price,"This item was good but I was hoping for so much more. It came highly recommended by friends, but honestly I could have done without it and been very happy. In summary, it's good for what it is but was not all that."
5,Microplane Grater / Zester,"Slickest gadget for grating/zesting money can buy. Inexpensive, well made and quick delivery. Recommend to anyone wanting to slick up an operation."
2,broke,"worked as expected untill blade snapped off at handel. Too be fair, I might have pressed too hard on blade.. I have a replacement and use it quite often however I'm now carefull not to press too firmly on blade.."
2,Not the greatest and too costly.,The game seemed to drawn out and the graphics seemed right out of the late 90's I felt as if parts of the terrain was missing and keyboard play was a mess. It should be one of those games listed for younger teens after removing some of the more adult content put there to cover holes in quality.
5,My son loves it.,"This was given to us by a friend and my son plays with it all the time. He loves to haul it around the house and put the blocks back in it. Great toy, very durable."
4,solid--in every sense of the word,"This is a super well-constructed toy, simple and straightforward. My son really likes it. Before he was ready to put the shapes in their individual holes, he would just dump them out and put them back in the top. His hand fits fine into the top hole. It's a little weighty, but that's not a bad thing, especially since recent studies have shown that kids who play with weighted toys have better muscle tone. I'm knocking off a star because, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the vertical slots are trickier to use than the slanted ones."
5,Urban Jazz Fusion Host- 89.3 WKKC in the Windy City,"J. Thompson's new CD is romantic, and soulful with seductive lyrics. This was a must add to our playlist! The smooth and accomplished sound of the hottest & most talented MVP line-up in history, (Marc Russo on sax, Will Kennedy on drums, Terrence Disley on keyboards, Eddie Henderson on trumpet, Karl Perrazzo on percussion, Melisa Kary's vocals and J.Thompson's brilliance on guitar) is sure to ignite a warm fire in your heart. Whether it's Urban Jazz, Nu-Soul, Quiet Storm, Contemporary Jazz your looking for, this CD has the versatility to smoothly slide into any of these categories. I group ""Romantic Night"" with no other artist because it's a stand alone. Prepare to be a part of the J. Thomposon era for many years to come! The "" Romantic Night"" CD has taken Chicago by storm! J.Thompson gives Jazz a new sound!"
1,Not worth a quarter,This flimsy plastic and cardboard piece does not hold up. Use (...) to put towards a better folder. A total waste of money.
4,Still Love Album Despite Remixes,"I really enjoy listening to this album. It has become One of my favorite CDs I listen to it in my walkman. I love all of the songs from tracks 1 to 13. I don't particularly care for the song ""Amazing Grace Dance"" which I felt wasn't the type of song for Vickie Winans to sing and the album would had been perfect without the remixes except the remix for ""Shake Yourself Loose"". I felt that her son did a wonderful job remixing that particular song. But by remixing the other songs just didn't make sense. All songs don't need to be remixed. Although I love this CD I pray that her next album will be more traditional because she has such a powerful and anointing voice."
1,Major disappointment,"This new release really reflects some of the major issues with albums. Two or three cuts are primo and the rest leave a lot to be desired. The remixes were the best thing on this album. Vickie's voice and presence is always strong! But the lyrics were terrible in many instances (Superman? How dated is that?). It presented gospel truths without any original artistic flavor. Not much creativity here. Granted maybe her audience was intended to be children, but I don't even think kids will be interested. Vickie has way too much talent to be doing these numbers. Get a new lyricist/s. dr. buzz"
4,criminal Justice organization administration and management,I enjoy the fact of being able to recevie my book on time and having the information at hand to master my education. The book I recevied was perfect for my educational needs.
4,Great topics - A must read for law enforcement administrators,"This book was required for a graduate level course that I recently completed. It was very challenging to read. I almost felt as if I needed a PhD to understand some of the chapters and questions that followed. The book was very informative and did include some great topics. But if you're just looking for a book to pass time, this is not it. Although, the authors did a very good job of making the book as interesting as possible, you'd really have to be truly interested in a management position within a law inforcement agency to appreciate its content. If that is your desire, the book is a necessity."
3,Title could have been better.,"I got this book from a family member, and wasn't quite sure if it was something good or bad, mainly due to the title, ""The Hidden Pope"". It kind of has a bad connotation to it, as if there's some dark secret. ""A Personal Journey"" might have been better as the title rather than the sub title. -2 points for a bad title that could send a conflicting message."
3,Well written,"Though the book is well written, too much space is given to the Jewish question. I hope the author would have taken a wider view of this great pope."
4,One of the Best Roles of Geena Davis.,"A middle class woman (Oscar-Winner:Geena Davis) gets her life changed, when she gets pregant by a Witty, Romantic Englishman (Stephen Rea) and she break-up with her Working Class Boyfriend (James Gandolfini), then she begins to Question herself everything about her life.Directed by Martha Coolidge has made a Charming Dramatic Comedy. Davis delivers one of her Best Performance. This film will touch something deep in the Viewers Hearts. Laserdisc Edition has an Running Commentary Track by Coolidge and Deleted Scenes. A well made film. Panavision. Grade:A-."
1,"Boring, whiney chick-flick","This film bored me out of my skull. Angie is an Italian woman from a traditional blue collar background who tries to ""find herself"" and become ""self-actualized."" So she bounces about relationships, tries her hand at pink collar careers, fixes up her own place, gets pregnant, gives up the kid (he's handicapped), then decides she wants it back. She also mends emotional bridges with her mother. Blah, blah, blah, yadda yadda, plus some hanky scenes and screamfests.I really hated this movie. I only bought it because the Internet Movie Database claimed that horror/B-movie actress Diane DiLascio (Poltergeist: The Legacy, Babylon 5, Star Trek: Enterprise) was in it. She's not. Guess she ended up on the cutting room floor."
3,Good Zester/Grater But....,"Although it does zest perfectly getting no pith, and grates hard cheese into wonderfully fluffy piles, without the handle this tool is hard to use. I bought the one without the handle looking to save a few dollars but I should have just upgraded then. It is awkward to hold, and your worried about cutting yourself. It really makes a grating job a lot harder and longer than it should be. Now I have to pay 15 more dollars for the one with the handle, when for 6 dollars more I could have just upgraded to begin with."
5,Creative Developmental Value!,"My 15 week old LOVES her Skwish - we purchased only 4 weeks ago and it's clearly been her favorite from the start! Wonderful for her little hands, easy enough for her to grasp at any angle, and as she enjoys everything in her mouth these days, I appreciate that she is unable to gag herself because the bands prevent her from pushing the wooden ball ends too far into her mouth! Love the colors as well, although I'm not sure she appreciates them as much at this time."
2,Meh...,"A very cheap DVD in price and quality. Lots of gore including plane crashes, shootings, warfare, ad infinitum. However, not much of what is shown is well filmed or even interesting.For example, there is a video in which a woman taped herself murdering her husband, but for the 45 second duration of the film, about 5 seconds of it are visible whatsoever. The rest is pitch black. The same goes for much of the footage here. SOME of the footage is filmed relatively well (enough so to please the gore enthusiast), but don't expect much. I spent $2 on this DVD, and got exactly what I paid for.Why the two star rating, you ask? Well, my copy has the sound out of synch with the film quite severely (about a twenty second delay) which seriously effects many of the scenes.This DVD is quite a mixed bag, so buyer beware."
3,not a bad shockumentary,"I have been an avid collector of extreme gore and shockumentary films for upward of 12 years.Now this film provides what a person who is even looking here would want to see,the death the bodies etc.But be warned much of the footage is usually being filmed after said deaths have already happened but there are exceptions.All in all i would say that this would be a good addition to your collection but is in no means as rare or as extreme as say death the ultimate horror or the faces of gore series."
4,A good read,"Krass, in this compeling biography is able to capture the internal contradictions and struggles Carnegie dealt with by intense research and often unbearable facts. He succeeds in bringing the reader into the actual life of Carnegie by relying heavily on primary sources. Krass also does an excellent job in portraying Carnegie as a philanthropist, setting a standard as a moral leader in America."
5,Lives up to its Name,"I was taken aback when I read on the back of the can that Soft 'n Silky eliminates mating. A second look showed that I had misread the word. This fine product actually promises to eliminate MATTING.For skin and coat care just spray on the product and massage. For mats and tangles one sprays on and waits ten minutes before brushing out.Gabby our Bolognese has long, beautiful hair that asks for daily attention. Sometimes, especially when we've missed a day, the brush or comb doesn't go through easily. Soft 'n Silky helps the brush do its work easier and smoother. Gabby doesn't complain as much when being brushed, and it a bonus that the spray has a pleasant scent. Those sensitive to smells might find it a bit strong, but we like it , and it soon dissipates and is only noticeable when getting close to your dog.If brushing has become a chore, an investment in a can of Soft 'n Silky may pay big dividends for you."
5,Excellent,"The conditioner helps dry skin and aids in detangling small tangles. I spray on and brushing seems so easy. The skin and coat shines and smells great! Only thing I have noticed is that if you have a thick coated, oily dog you do not want to spray to much on for the coat will be flat and heavy, not fluffy with bounce. Example are some cocker spaniels or bishon frises I have had. But collies, shepards, and german shorthairs look great! Downfall is it is hard to find in stores so order online and get the best deal..."
2,Great Pictures but not reliable,"I have had this camera for about nine months, and love the zoom and it takes great pictures. About 2 weeks ago after downloading about 200 pictures to the computer from a 128 meg card, the camera lost power and wouldn't power back up. I had to send it in for repairs, which I found to be a flat rate repair of a high price if your warranty has expired. While researching online to try to find what had happened I also found that many others had the same problem, and it appears to be something that Olympus shoud recall and fix. It appears that if the batteries get low, the power circut board burns out! Because of this problem I would tell everyone to beware of this camera, snd it appears that other Olympus models have this same problem. I have purchased a card reader so as not to have the batteries get low when downloading, and hope this will solve the problem. If it breaks again, I will just throw this camera away as the cost of repair is too high."
5,a fine camera,"it's a pleasure to own this.. it is everything a photo hobbyist could ask for.. with the exception that "" right around the corner"" Olympus will be announcing the 3.4 or 4.0 etc. model of this same camera and I'll have to have that. Unlike the c3000 and c700, this camera feels and looks like a camera should ...solid constuction .. and controls that make sense and to the extent possible, save on battery expenditure..ie (the mode switch is separate from the on/off switch).. many more thing I could mention in comparison to some of their other models in the $... price range but time doesn't permit it ..nevertheless the C2100 is not only quality but ""fun"" to use."
5,By By 35mm!!!,"This is by far the best camera I've ever owned. The camera may look complicated but if you simply want to point and shoot it's no problem. As you advance in your photo skills it will advance with you. It feels like your holding an old fashioned 35mm, but takes even better pictures. Order a larger memory card if you love to take pictures, the standard 16 picture capacity was simply not enough for me. I've had my C-2100 for a year and thought it was a great buy ...! I'm kind of sick to see it can be purchased for nearly half that price now!"
5,Nice sound,"We use ours strictly for RV use. I would have to spend thousands to get my RV wired for sound. These are a nice alternative, and saves the hassles of wiring and setup. Just plug it in and it's good go, indoors or out.I can't rate the sound quality on par with my bose PC speakers, but these serve their purpose.I rank them a high score for their portablity."
4,Excellent Sound!!,"This is a great stereo for your ipod. The sound is great and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. (ok its pricey but well worth it) My only complaint is I have a 2nd Generation iPod Nano (aluminum) and the nano insert does not fit. Yes, I can use the other ipod inserts, but it causes it to be flimsy in the other ipod holder-you have to be cautious. (If you were to hit the ipod by accident there is a possibility of it breaking the connector right off the sound dock) I will be calling Bose to see if they have a replacement part or if all 2nd gen nano's are like this. (Judging by some of the past reviews this has been an ongoing problem and I would hope it has been addressed) Overall great product. I gave it 4 stars cause of the hassle of having to call and request a new insert or be stuck with what I have)"
3,Disappointing - No Auxiliary Audio Inputs ! ! !,"Like all other Bose products, the sound from the SoundDock is amazing, rich, and surprisingly room filling for such a small speaker.Unfortunately, the fantastic sound is limited to playing files from your iPod. You can't hook the speaker up to a television, stereo, or any other audio source because there are no auxiliary audio inputs, so when the iPod isn't docked the unit is useless.I was extremely disappointed to learn this. If it weren't for this limitation I would have ranked the SoundDock higher than 3 stars."
3,Bose SoundDock digital music system,"We like the sound but the power cord connection is very fragile. The connection that goes into the dock has four very thin pins. After just a few months, they broke off. The power cord is very heavy and may put additional stress on the pins."
5,Great sound!!!!,"This is a really neat system and really really are enjoying it. My husband keeps his ipod in it and now is hard for me to use, really need 2"
1,Stopped working after a year,I have bought sound dock 1.0 some 14 months back and although I was not heavy user of it but after a year it stopped working. It gets power and all but unable to produce any sound. Cost to get it repaired form Bose with S&H is prett heavy and at this point I have decided to throw it away. Clearly not a product for years
4,"Good book, but it drags at times.","This book is the story of the discovery of human retroviruses including the AIDS virus. It traces the life of Robert Gallo from his first job to world fame and controversy. There is a lot of good detail about retroviruses and the techniques being used to fight them. The book does stumble sometimes. Some of the history is writen in a defensive style to dispell the negative reaction that Dr. Gallo has receive because of the anti-body test dispute with the French. Also the process of discovery, where he talks about lab work is very, very boring. It lacks the right kind of details to get the reader excited. Except for the above points it is good book that should be read."
5,A Classic on the Path of Individuation,"I read Edinger's work in the late 70s after an intense spiritual awakening which was first expressed in Christian fundamentalism in the early 70s. During a time of study at the C.G. Jung Foundation and the New School (New York City) I began to discover the spiritual meaning and personal potential of the Christian myth. The work continues to this day, and I am thankful to Edinger and others (Neumann, Jacobi, Von Franz, Whitmont) who extended the insights of Jung for pioneers along the path of individuation."
4,Not too bad,"This is the best Eastern Armenian dictionary available outside of Armenia. It's pretty complete, although not exactly as up-to-date as one may like. It comes in 2 different sized pocket versions, which are nice to have when travelling. For a serious translator or scholar, this dictionary leaves something to be desired."
3,OK...not comprehensive,"This is NOT by any means a comprehensive dictionary. For the most part, however, it is sufficient for the beginner and/or the casual user and/or the child in the family. It is not a serious dictionary, mainly due to its conciseness, lack of depth and range.It's a concise dictionary, which means that there are short translations (1 or 2 word, maybe a sentence) and without much, if any, explanations and/or any examples."
3,pretty good,"The bars taste pretty good, but I couldn't taste the chocolate like I wanted. Also, I found I like to cut the bars in half and only eat one half at a time after a workout. I'm 5'7"" at 125 lbs and a whole bar is too much at one time unless the workout is extremely intense."
5,"Great high protein, low sugar meal replacement","I have searched widely for high-protein bars that are low in sugar, without using sugar alcohols. Chef Jay's bar fit the bill well with about 30g of protein and 15g of sugar. They are still tasty and somewhat sweet (due to splenda), although a bit dry. I recommend the carmel apple and berry flavors."
5,"Cool, Hip and Sober","I had read this book by borrowing it initially from the public library and was so impressed with it, I went onto Amazon to purchase a copy. For anyone struggling with sobriety or with a family member, friend, etc. struggling with sobriety, I think this is an awesome book."
1,A poor choice among alternatives,"To be avoided. Mr. Stoltenberg is spot on: this is a very poor choice in today's situation. In terms of quality of interpretation, vocal timbres, and recording -- this is indeed well sub-par. The Tallis Scholars and A Sei Voci will reveal the timeless beauty of these scores in infinitely better sound and execution."
1,"Por design, Poor quality",This unit is poorly designed and poorly constructed. Sharp metal edges pinch wires while atempting to assemble the unit. Mine failed after one week. Has a cool looking blue neon pilot light...that's about all it is good for. Don't buy it.
3,FIRST SCANNER,"I JUST BOUGHT THIS SCANNER AND IT IS MY FIRST. I WAS NOT LOOKING FOR A $500 DOLLAR SCANNER AS IT WILL BE USED FOR HOME. I KNEW IT WOULD NOT BE THE TOP OF THE LINE. **I WAS IMPRESSED** THE SOFTWARE TOOK ME A WHOLE 15 MIN TO INSTALL AND THE SET UP WAS ABOUT 3 MINUTES. WITHIN 20 MINUTES I HAD MY FIRST SCAN AND IT WAS GREAT.I SCANNED A PHOTO AND FROM START TO FINISH, IT TOOK APPROX 3MINUTES TO HAVE A PERFECT PICTURE ON MY SCREEN. I READ SOME OF THE OTHER REVIEWS AND I THINK THOSE PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY WERE GETTING A MILION DOLLAR SCANNER FOR UNDER $100 BUCKS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY SCANNER FOR THE PRICE I PAID. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A FIRST TIME SCANNER WHO DOESN'T HAVE EXPECTATIONS OF A MILLION DOLLAR SCANNER........"
2,Disappointing Ellen Barkin/Lawrence Fishburne Vehicle.,"Viewed: 1/09Rate: 31/09: Knowing in advance that Laurence Fishburne and Ellen Barkin starring together in Bad Company, I expected a very good movie. Instead what I got was a mind-jumbling disappointment of a picture. The biggest error was owed to the nonsensical plot. I'll say that the slick direction of Damian Harris to be very good as he kept the vision of Bad Company to be sharp and appealing with enough style. The more time spent watching the story unfold before my eyes, the less I understand what the heck the movie was all about. Ellen Barkin sure can play a very sexy character, but it's too bad that she wasted her talent in this clunker. I actually liked the creation of the characters as the cast seemed suited to play all of them except for Michael Beach who should remain Mr. Clark's btch. All in all, Bad Company is the opposite of Frogs for Snakes and ought to be re-titled as Bad Movie."
3,Not that great....,"Bought this bassinet because description states it can be converted into a playpen. This is not the case! We travel a lot and thought it would be great for that. Also not the case. As other reviewers have said, this thing is a pain, at best, to set up and take down. The bars do not want to lock! We have taken it down on three separate occasions. Each time it has taken 15-20minutes to set up again. The size is great, not too large and clunky. Storage underneath is a great idea but we have never used it. You must sit on the floor to access it. Love the extra pockets on the sides. These are great for holding diapers and wipes for middle of the night changings. Overall not really worth it for us. Should have just gone with a pack n play. Wanted to return it but couldn't get it to fit back into the shipping box."
4,shattered wheels,"I have yet to have my baby but when we received the bassinet which comes highly recommended, both wheels were shattered. Not sure how to order replacements so will just go to the local hardware to buy new ones. The mattress pad does seem a bit hard....we will see. Everything else was simple and I love the color."
5,Second baby and still going,"This has been the single greatest price of baby gear for us! We bought our min co sleeper 5 years ago for our first child and he nursed so often I was able to get much more sleep having him so accessible. We stored it and brought it back out for baby #2 this year and she has been in it for 6 months. I am so sad that the time is coming for her to move to the crib. The only thing is that when we travel we take a Pack n play so we don't have to take the cosleeper up and down, I think that would be a Pain."
3,Not a convertible mini!,The product I received was the Mini Co-sleeper...NOT the convertible mini! The product description is misleading.Here is the link to Arm's Reach Mini:[...]Here is the link for the CONVERTIBLE Arm's Reach Mini:[...]They are not the same!
3,"Good idea but a pain to ""disassemble""","I bought this before our baby was born just because we could fit it with our bed. Luckily for our little queen bed its level was just at the right height for Mom to easily get to the child. For a normal King size bed with box spring this bassinet is wayyyy down.Also it is a pain to ""disassemble"". There are two joints in every horizontal ""pipe"". Although there are buttons that are supposed to make them loose. But typically one joint would get loose but other won't. I was relocating and I decided to took this bassinet with me for the baby during our stay in the hotel. It was a real struggle to get it to ""disassemble"".You can get cheaper ""pack n play"" that would be a lot more convenient than this."
2,"Perfectly good product - only problem is, baby won't sleep in it!","This is a well-designed and constructed co-sleeper, and in principal a brilliant idea. The only problem is, my almost two-week-old baby absolutely refuses to sleep in it. We're keeping it for now and trying to introduce him to it a little at a time, but in the meantime are finding much better success with the much cheaper Fisher Price Rock n Play sleeper. This may yet come in handy as he grows, but so far, it's just serving as an over-priced changing table. Better luck to others!"
3,Cover not removable..,"Had the 'Original(larger)"" version of this first, loved it! Cover was removable and washable, somewhat easy to assemble/disassemble, very handy- served it's purpose. Then... one top bar could not unlock on one side no matter how/what I tried, so I could not fold/store it. Had to leave it in its assembled form. Got this mini version- much smaller, so if baby starts rolling/moving around, can't really use it anymore. One MAJOR gripe for me- it was only available in 'natural' color, which quickly stained. Cover is NOT removable, and though we spot cleaned, didn't like the idea that I couldn't throw cover in wash, like the larger version.Overall, it does serve it's purpose, so I give it 3 stars. I should add- I bought this about 6 years ago, so maybe they've changed their design to include a removable cover."
5,Monticello Revisited,"I visited Monticello several years back, before they had dvds. It was one of my favorite historical sites. This dvd did a great job of capturing the major places of interest, as well as giving historical info. It brought back many pleasant memories."
1,Worthless piece of junk,"This piece of junk just completely died one day with absolutely no warning. I had a firewall and virus protection, so it was not a virus, and when I called computer support they said it ""happens all the time."" It lasted one year and one week, which was of course one week beyond the warranty. I would never buy another product from this company."
3,Take it or leave it,"My book club chose to read this book for the month of ""comedy"". I honestly did not find it to be that funny nor that entertaining. Apparently, that was pretty much everyone's opinion in our group. I liked it enough to finish it but have no interest in recommending it or reading the rest of the series. I consider this to be a ""light read"" that maybe you would carry to the beach or on a plane trip."
2,How disappointing.,"The fact this book was ever published is beyond my comprehension. the only reason I even finished it was the fact that it is this months reading for d.c. sci-fi club.Original material? Maybe. A much better author, my 3 year old nephew for example could have turned this into a much more interesting story. If this author is ever allowed to publish another book I will forever boycott that publisher.Sorry to be crass but the only way I was able to finish this book was by making it the only book availible in the toilet. Buy it at your own risk."
5,Baby shampoo,"I highly recommend this hair and body wash for babies with sensitive skin. Here's the breakdown of pros and cons:1) Like: the fragrance is not too strong and smells amazing, the formula rinses well and does not lather too much, and we haven't had any allergic reactions2) Don't like: it's one of the more expensive cleansers (but it does last for a while since you only need a little bit to wash the whole baby)There's not much else to say about it!"
5,Great combo,"We love Mustela products. This is very helpful when you travel cause you have the shampoo and the body wash in one. We regularly use the separate shampoo, but this one works too. Smells great"
5,CLASSIC COMEDY AT ITS BEST ... MUST SEE DVD ...,"UTOPIA - This film marks the final chapter of all the Laural and Hardy films. In this hilarious feature, Stan and Ollie inherit an island, in which hugh amounts of uranium are present. Watch the fun explode on screen, as the dynamic duo go through their incredibly zany antics.MUD AND SAND - One of their earliest silent films, this hilarious tale was set in medieval times, and had audiences of all ages begging for more."
2,Nice fit and feel but poor reliability.,I bought this gun and was happy with it for the first 1.5 years but it then developed a substantial internal air leak and occasional piston jam as several other reviews have stated. After checking with Dewalt for repair cost I decided to purchase the Milwaukee 7140-21 instead and have been very pleased with it so far. The Milwaukee 7140-21 also has a 5 year warranty and a selectable trigger that is a great feature.
5,This text has an incredible amount of wisdom and knowledge.,"Dr. Somersall has done a marvelous service to the health and wellness community by explaining in layman's terminolgy the import and significance of this breakthrough in cell-defense. I believe that this Glutathione Revolution has just begun and will remain with us for many years to come. A wonderful piece of literary works and my gratitude to both you and, of course, Dr. Gustavo Bounous, a modern day genius who should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his marvelous contribution and incredible achievement to all humanity."
5,$132.00?,"Jackson wheelbarrows are probably the best on the market. I've been in the concrete business for over 30 years and I've seen all kinds of wheelbarrows come and go but Jackson's endure. But, $170.00? Someone must have been hallucinating when they set that price. Home Depot sells the same item for $99.00. And check out that site that's selling them for $24......if you pay the shipping charges of over $200.00!! Shop wisely."
4,life IS sweet,what better way to listen to the greatest song in history than play it over and over again in different formats........
2,problem,"I HAVE OWNED MY BELL CORDLESS PHONE, MODEL 39705, FOR 5 YEARS AND AFTER DISCONNECTING IT DUE TO MOVING, AND RECONNECTING IT, IT EMITS A 2 SECOND LONG BEEP APPROXIMATELY EVERY 5 MINUTES. THIS IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I HAVE LEFT MESSAGES AT THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT LINE (1-800-888-8990) AS INSTRUCTED, BUT NO ONE RETURNS MY CALLS. I AM READY TO DUMP THE THING AND OBVIOUSLY PURCHASE A DIFFERENT BRAND."
5,Payne Stewart: The Authorized Biography,Very well written by Wife. Interesting info on tournaments and life of a great man and golfer. If you like Golf you should love it.
3,Battle with Cattle,"It's Dragonlance, it's Richard Knaak, and it's got minotaurs. It's a good recipe and makes for a nice fantasy read. I will say that if you're new to Dragonlance, don't read this one first. Read the Legend of Huma, and then you can take this one on.It's a fun adventure, but not on par with Huma. Knaak is a good writer but he overdoes it some times. When Kaz is irritated he snorts. I get it. Unfortunately he's always irritated so it seems he's constantly snorting. Every page he's snorting.And there are some cliches. The villianous elf fits the mold of a stereotypical baddie. He's crazy and wants power. We've seen that before. The kender is full of energy and gets in trouble. The minotaur is tough as nails and can deliver first rate butt-kickings even after being crushed, speared, drowned, etc.So to sum it up, this book is exactly what you expect it to be. Fortunately I expected a good adventure and it was. But I would have enjoyed some surprises."
3,KAZ...living in Huma's Shadow,"The book deals with the life of Kaz, after Huma's death. Very interesting, and it has some pretty good action. Unfortunatley, it is slightly predictable. But I still recommend it if you are a fan of ""The Legend of Huma""."
2,ePhoto Smile Digital Camera,Fairly easy to use but the resolution was unacceptable. Thepurchase [price] makes it a good buy for a beginner.
5,Flower arranging book,"This is the best one I have seen. It describes what tools are needed, suggests the plants and flowers and how to go about it with the end results and all in living color. I am very pleased not to have to look any further. MCrossland"
2,Just didn't like it.,I simply found it hard to enjoy this movie. A old black man chains up a young white woman in his cabin and expects things to be hunky-dory. He doesn't take advantage of her or anything like that (she is the one who takes advantage of men) but I just found the storyline difficult to believe and the ending was rather cliched. Eh.
1,leaky air compressor,used this air comporessor to place 500 sq feet of floor and began to leak. had to bring it 3 times to the dewalt service center before they agree that it leaked. I was given a replacement D55155 that began to leak again the first day. piece of junk.
5,Unfathomable,"This is easily the greatest CD I have yet to listen to. It has lyrics, an assortment of instruments, and a mixture of various elements into a unified theme that can only be described in terms of anticipation and longing. Let's face it: this hasn't been released as of the writing of this review, there's no info on what the format is, and I don't know what Plant is up to other than making more money, and I LOVE IT!!! I ordered 17 copies, and highly recommend you do the same."
1,"UNSATISFIED, need to return or exchange product a.s.a.p.",I received a 3 prong unit but my Dell laptop requires a 2 prong plug. I've emailed both the manufacturer and Amazon on procedure to return or exchange the item. Neither Amazon or the manufacturer have responded to my request to return or exchange for 2 prong item. Pleae respond.
5,I just HAD to respond to the last review.,"DVD One-Clicker, you are truly an idiot. Burt Bacharach is without doubt one of the finest songwriters to come out of the 60's. His use of musical dynamics and brass set him miles above other writers and producers of the same era. Stick to the Monkees."
5,Awesome,"Have 3 of these ranging from 2-5 years old. They are very good nailers. Extra nail capacity is perfect for contractors. Have shot over 10,000 nail through the 3 nailers with 4 jams.I use Hitachi for framing and angle finish, Dewalt for straight finish and Dewalt and Porter for brad nails.Finish nailer get alot of use doing base, crown, window casing, trim, ect.I'm a contractor and the Dewalt can hang with EVERY day use."
1,This toaster should be TOASTED!,"Had mine about 6 months. It has [burned] out three times, I've taken it apart and got it working, it goes a while longer and [burns] out again. Everything's on a circuit board and short of sending it back there's nothing you can do. I guess trashing it to cut my losses and aggravation would be the best thing. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,(...),"This entire review is a truthful individual opinion(...). It is filmed horribly, grainy, with actors that leave much to be desried in their film appearences in my opinion, let alone the actual ""demonstrations"". Absolutely apalling. The ""trademarked"" techniques by namesake are ALL techniques.(...)The product description (very cheesy manipulaive sensory-linguistic gobbledygook) asks ""Why settle for BETTER SEX""... In this case, BETTER SEX may indeed be your absolutely best choice. (...)I'd have given it negative stars if it were possible by the way, this is rated NC-17... Many have told me they wonder if it's a serious violation of the law or maybe the Unrated editions from other providers offer far better visual ""Techincal Detail"" (...)You'll find better titles teaching real INTIMACY from reknowned INSTITUTEs and your partner will be gratified on all levels."
2,don't bother,"I got sucked in by this album because it had the sticker on it ""for fans of Pink Floyd and Enigma"". I should have known that they were using someone else's fame to try to capture a few $.After listening, I don't get the Floyd connection AT ALL. I can see the Enigma connection (I'm a huge fan of both of these bands by the way, especially Floyd - my favorite band since I was a kid). But as far as Enigma goes - can't hold a candle to Cretu.Don't bother unless your absolutely desperate for gregorian chant with some drum beats.Anyone want to buy my copy?///M"
2,Get a Bigg Lugg!,"This ""Monster Hook"" is made mainly of plastic and aluminum, the plastic tends to break too easily. Sometimes the rivet pulls through the plastic, sometimes it just breaks in half. I've been wanting a Bigg Lugg, as it's all metal, but I cant find one locally, I guess I'll have to order one. Both are the same price, one is ust made better than the other."
2,Not what I expected,"Maybe it was me that got the wrong size, but it does fit snugly if not comfortably, but all the inside is made of a dense foam that is very hard, and then only a very thin layer of pad attached with velcro. It also sits too high on my head and that seems to take away from the back protection. I think I might have to stick with Pro-Tec."
5,The book saved me a ton of time!,John Merry has saved me many hours surfing the net. The book highlights the best aviation sites and cuts out the ones not worth my time. Thanks! I'm recommending the book to all my friends and co-workers.
2,Cheap plastic,"These shades are made of plastic and don't fit very well on the lamp assemblies. The bulb (which just slides into the lamp socket) actually holds the shades on, but only loosely and with a visible gap. They do look better than the bare bulb and reduce the backlight refraction pattern somewhat.It looks like Amazon may have just lowered the price and changed how this item is handled, but I had to pay $9.99 plus $7.90 for ground shipping from the manufacturer (since this item evidently did not qualify for super saver shipping a week ago even though my total order was around $60) After shelling out $18 total for these shades, I expected a little more than cheap plastic that probably cost less than 25 cents each to make."
1,Worse than lousy: buy another brand,"This blender is a joke. The blade went dull after onlyone week of use, and the blade would not hold an edge at all. Itliterally could not be sharpened again, even with the best tools.On top of that, the motor is burning out after only 2 months.My first belnder was a Hamilton Beach that was fabulous. Thisblender is serious garbage. I will definately never buy a Hamilton Beach product ever again."
3,Happy but not very ....,I've had this Brad Nailer for a few months. I seldom use it and estimate that I have fired assorted length nails somewhere in the 250 or so count till now.I did not encounter any misfires or dry fires whatsoever but sometimes the plunger won't recycle. I don't know if it's the angle that I shoot the nails but somehow if I shoot it real straight and press the nose a bit harder then this problem does not happen.
1,advantus all-weather outdoor u.s. flag 100% heavyweight nylon 5x,this flag did not last one month and you wonder why people buy from china and japan total waste of money
2,Not recommended for beginners,The tutorials are poorly written. The authors spend more time explaining the historical and artistic aspects of the artwork instead of explaining lightwave to you.
5,The best 3D graphics book ever!!!,I own quite a library of graphics books and this is by far the best and most practical book ever. I don't know what the person from Georgia is refering to about needing plug-ins. All the plug-ins used in the text are included in Lightwave (5.6). Want to do photorealistic animation of ocean? It's in there. Want to do a photorealistic animation of a fountain using particle storm-lite? It's in there. Want to render various gems and metals photorealistic? Its in there! I'm developing an adventure game and this book has helped my modeling immensely.
2,Disappointment!!,"Looks great but ergonomically it is a failure. Major issue is difficult to take the phone in or out, case lining came out in a month. Waste of money!!"
4,A singularly comprehensive ecologcial history of this region,"Many have written about the region's history, some have connected its ecology to the invasion of colonists and subsequent events familiar from grade school studies of the origins and development of our nation. This book give context and meaning to both. Along the way, it roots our present conservation challenges in a firmer substrate, and contributes to our understanding of this place with a solid foundation in a philosophy of interdependence with the natural world in a time when that notion is all too uncommon. I recommend it. My only gripes: its overwrought exposition on ecological histories is a bore and it is painfilly overpriced which will limit the readership of what is otherwise an important book."
4,Exciting Novel,"It started out slow at first, then I thought I wasn't going to enjoy this book, as I started to read into the novel the story went form one character to character the story started to fit into place. I couldn't put the book down; it became so interesting to read the difference in the time line story from the different characters. Over all I would recommend this novel to read."
5,A real blade saver,This is a real winner. Worth its weight in gold. Not only has our workshop made this a mandatory tool for anyone using one of our 26 planers but I have one at my home shop that has saved me on several occasions. I bought a Garrett Security Scanner...and it does not scan even half as deep as a Wizard. Wizard also has a rock solid warranty. We had one unit that had a slight problem and not only did the folks at Wizard replace it they did it quickly and did not put us to any amount of the usual torture that most companies put customers through. I have to say this is one great tool. I highly recommend it. Also there are several great articles in the top woodworking magazines.
2,"Get Over It, Dude","The Hedgehog. He gives the rest of us average Joes hope for the future. I mean, if this guy can get action, who can't? This documentary about one of the adult world's 'biggest' male stars should have been really something. It wasn't.Ron Jeremy is simply too stuck on the fact that his calling in this world just isn't given the level of respect he would like. As a result, Jeremy has to remind us over and over again about the miniscule appearances he has made in non-adult roles. One episode of some TV show, in which Jeremy appears for a grand total of about two seconds, is commented upon because, well jeez, please notice, it has nothing to do with porn.Ron, you picked your calling. We all have regrets in life and we may empathize with yours. But in watching this flick, I wanted to see about the life you lead, not the one you wish you had. For such an interesting life, this was a pretty lifeless documentary."
3,It's not a movie,"Boy, I was excited when I found out this ""movie"" was going to be made. There it was, the news they were making a movie about the life of Ron Jeremy.... only problem is, when I finally got to see this recently, I found out it's not a movie at all. It's just an hour and a half doccumentary.None of what was shown really surprised me, and I didn't really learn anything by watching it. nevertheless, it's an interesting docco to watch once because it's about Ron jeremy... the world's most recognised male porn star, who by every expectation has no place in the business. He's fat, hairly and not particularly good looking.Of course, that's what makes him so recognisable =)Good docco, but it's only one to watch once."
3,Pornstar,"This movie (sort of) works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Unlike ""Sex: The Annabel Chong Story"" (another documentary about a pornstar -- Ron Jeremy appears in it also) which was pretentious and self-indulgent, ""Pornstar: The Legend of Ron Jeremy"" is a light-hearted and funny chronicle of how an unattractive, fat, hairy guy became one of the most famous adult film stars in the world. The movie lacked a consistent flow and felt a little too scattered, however. It offers bits and pieces of Ron Jeremy's ""life and career"", but fails to provide the big picture. I didn't get much out of it other than some cheap laughs. The quality of filmmaking was rather amateurish too."
4,Daring robberies!,"Most of these i had already seen on tv before, but it's still interesting seeing some of them again and interesting to see people in other countries (besides the US, remember it's ""Worlds"" most daring robberies) but like i said not many that you haven't already seen on tv or interenet clips.Still if you like cop type shows, this is for you :)"
1,Don't buy if you need to record,"This player has no way of transferring things you record onto another Computer or even other media. It has, as my reviewer colleague explains, no line out.I bought this as I am a professional musician, and I want to record and archive rehearsals, etc. It was sold with a microphone(which I didn't buy) for that purpose.The manual says this, but it is on page 72 in 8 point font in a footnote. The advertizing is misleading, as it says you can ""check in"" tracks.The whole promise of MD devices was that you could do everything on them a CD couldn't do--like record. This lack of feature effectivly prevents you from recording, because you can never get the recording off the Mini Disc. In fact, for all the great editing tools that are advertised with this device, you cannot even edit the recording live.The only solution is to plug it into a ripper. This converts the digital signal to analog, effectivly wasting the whole point of using digital media in the first place."
5,Uncover the Human Body: An Uncover It Book,"I know this type of book is for older kids, but my four year old loves it and the other ""Uncover It"" books he has. He started out with the ""Uncover A Frog"", and he now has T-Rex, Tarantula, and Shark."
2,It's a toss up,"This is certainly not the most interesting piece of music to which I have listened. This is for the person who like contemporary music, perhaps even experimental. The performance is good, but the composition itself is the downfall. But what should I have expected from Tavener. This is go into my never listen to again pile."
1,Elementary,"Other reviews about this book got me interested in wanting to read it, as the plot sounded breezy, casual and gently amusing. While it contained all those descriptives, this book was just too simplified for me. I am not a fan of authors like Danielle Steele because of the simplicity and ""pat"" story lines and this one was exactly that. If you like ""light"" reading, with plots too outlandish to be true in any form, this book will interest you. The characters and the whole plot of this book was just too simple. No complications at all and the end of the story was completely predictable. This story had no teeth. I also purchased her 2nd and 3rd books, and now I wish I hadn't, as I can almost predict these will be just like this one. The author needs to thicken her plots and characters as to create some interest for the reader, unless you are a hopeless romantic without common sense or a brain."
4,This was cute.,"I was prepared to not like this book, thought it would be an attempt at rewriting a very old story, but it is a really cute story. Julie and Romeo are old, for one thing, but the whole family feud thing is there. The humor this author places in bits and pieces is fabulous, and really perks up the story. Both Julie and Romeo own rivaling flower shops, and both have families that hate with an intense passion. They meet after many years, neither one really remembering why they hate each other in the first place, and - you guessed it - they fall in love. Their families are horrified and the scenes to follow will have you chuckling. This author is incredibly clever and well spoken, and I recommend this book for a lighthearted escape - very worth it."
4,"""Love is lovelier..etc""","Love is lovelier the second time around..go the words of the old song and this tiny book is just about that!! Old rivals in the floristry world,the Italian Cacciamani's and the Jewish Roseman's are still feuding after 3 generations of hatred and revenge.Divorced Julie Roseman meets widowed Romeo Cacciamani and as the Sicilians say--are struck by the thunderbolt! Their mad,intense love affair horrifies the members of both their families who go to incredible lengths to break up the couple. I found this to be a wonderfully warm and engaging story which shows that it's not only the young who can love,suffer and enjoy all the aspects of love."
5,Extraordinary read!!!,"This book was great, I read it in 1 day. A beautiful love story that had me laughing and crying. I wanted to reach in the book and smack Julie's daughters and Romeo's sons. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hopes that love wins out for the young and old."
4,A sweet update on a classic story,"In this book, 60-year old divorced Julie Roseman, owner of a floundering flower shop, unexpectedly finds herself attracted to Romeo Cacciamani, widower and owner of the town's rival flower shop. The Roseman and Caciamani families have always hated each other, and although neither Julie nor Romeo knows the reason for this, both sets of children are determined to keep the feud alive. Julie is torn: she loves her family, but doesn't she deserve a bit of happiness, too?Although this is author Jeanne Ray's first novel, it's actually the third book of hers that I've read, and so far, my least favorite. Although Julie and Romeo is a sweet, charming tale, it's a bit predictable; I think Ray really hits her stride with her later novels, particularly the delightful Eat Cake. Still, this book is an enjoyable, very fast read (I read it in two days), and I plan to continue on to the sequel, Julie and Romeo Get Lucky."
3,Only does half the job it is meant to do,"When I purchased this gun it seemed to be a winner.Light, powerful , great features. It wasn`t untill I loaded the gun with a new box of 8`s to bang out a sheathing job.This gun will not shoot any brand of 8`s strip nails , tried them all.It seems like the spring holding the strip nails has too much force and buches them together , jamming the gun after three shots.It does shoot 10`s excellent with ease , but for [money], it does half the job of any other nail gun.Try a friends before you buy one...."
4,decent gun,When I got this gun I was really pleased. It's light and fairly powerful. But after framing about 20 houses in the last year or so it just couldn't hold up. The power dropped dramatically and then the nose and trigger gave up.It probably would do great under a less stressful workload.
4,Great show!,I think that this show is a great Sunday night show that brings you back in time. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to take on a show!
5,Pan Am Thumbs up!,"This show is awesome! There is something for everyone. Romance, drama, espienage, politics, history. Foriegn affairs. Very captivating. i enjoyed every minute. I hope next season starting in january will be as good as fall season one."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST IN CELTIC MUSIC!!! NONE BETTER!,"If you love Celtic music and don't have this cd in your collection, you are really missing out, seriously! Of the hundreds and hundreds of recordings of celtic music by many artists, both old and new, that I've collected over the years, this album is MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE. No one has ever made the the lyrics sound better than Rowena Taheny; her voice is so hauntingly beautiful and soul-stirring, and the instrumentals are unsurpassed-no one has ever sounded better. My only regret is that, I too, have waited (impatiently), searching over and over, for more releases by this duo, only to be disappointed by the fact that this is the only nugget to be found. If anyone knows this couple, PLEASE urge them to GET BUSY AND DO MORE, SOON!!"
1,A Big Disappointment...,"My Sony player was a model S350 instead of an S250, but it has the same features and looks the same. I used it mainly for my recorded books on CD and tape. After only occasional use, it quit after less than 6 months, giving an error message of ""no disc."" Well, I thought I could at least use the tape player, but shortly thereafter, one of the tape control buttons literally broke off when I pressed it in normal use. The unit is just over warranty -- so goodbye $70 -- and I'm back shopping for a replacement (I got this unit from another store, not Amazon). But I won't get a Sony product this time around, sorry to say."
1,Buyer beware,"It was never my intention to buy this book at all. I was looking for novels by George Elliott and some how found myself purchasing this book at $207.00 - as if - the most alarming thing was that whilst I was anxiously trying to cancel this order, the money had already been taken out. I was supposed to get a full refund, but was $10.00 short. My advice to browsers looking for Kindle books, be careful which buttons you press."
3,Not her usual stuff.,It's an entertaining album without the oomph of her previous gospel albums. There wuz quite a bit of preaching on it which I feel decreased the momentum.
5,I Want To Fall,"This is one of the few release I consitantly put in my top 5, even if only for one track... ""I Want To Fall"" is perfect new school electro. I can listen to it over and over and over.It was a regular track in my sets for quite a while and if I was spinning out now even, I'd still throw it in."
4,Good tool for the money,"This small metal detector works surprisingly well for such an inexpensive tool. I used it to find nails in some pine boards salvaged from the ceiling of a century-old house. It managed to detect the 2 or 3 nails that I didn't see (and likely would have missed entirely). Bear in mind that you often have to scan the board from more than one direction to detect the nails and this small model isn't likely to find anything in lumber that's very thick (much over one inch). The larger model is probably more sensitive and easier to use, but if you buy this one, you're still won't be throwing your money away."
4,Great little tool...,"I was given this as a gift. I do a lot of resaw on my bandsaw, mostly chunks of hardwood and fruit woods I acquire in the round. It's amazing the amount of nails, wire staples, bullets,etc you can find in this type of wood. I was fairly impressed with the depth range. Though some reviewer's have said this will only read to an inch, I have found metal screws at a 3 inch depth in a piece of alder. The tree had grown up and around them, saved a good bandsaw blade on that one.My one and only complaint is tone volume, could be a little louder for us ""old"" guys, whose hearing isn't top notch. That being said, this is a great little tool and a nice addition to my shop. I use it a lot, and recommend it highly."
3,Not that helpful.,"I purchased this so I could hear what the songs I'm practicing are supposed to sound like. However, it's hard for me to clearly discern which sounds I'm supposed to be making because the cd barely contains actual piano sounds! I'm getting a vauge idea but I purchased this cd hoping I'd hear an actual piano playing the tunes from the lesson book. Perhaps children would be more able to find the sounds they need for help but as an adult maybe my ear for music is just too out of practice. I hope this is of help to anyone else who was thinking of purchasing it for the same reason I did.As an aside: the Piano Adventures series books themselves are the best I've seen for a piano teaching method that takes one through in gradual steps."
5,I love this series!!,"The Piano Adventures series is great. The pieces are fun to play, and the theory and progression is sound. They are the best out there!"
4,Best book written about Aris,This book explains quite good how to use Aris in practice. However it's quite heavy to read through. There could be more pictures and charts to get things clearer and easier to understand. But still absolutely the best book about Aris.
1,Wrong movie sent,I received the wrong movie. I received The Perfect Man with Heather Locklear in it.So at this time I do not have a review for The Perfect Man. I suggest that when you have more than one movie with the same title please may sure the vendor send the correct one that the customer order.
5,"One of the BEST CDs I've ever heard, every song is great.","I own a lot of CD's of all different types of music (except for country). This CD is so f\/ckin' awesome. From song one to the end, every song is great. Usually when I buy a CD there are a couple of dud songs on it, but this CD is great all the way through. This CD has hardcore, trance, all put together with some of the most creative beats ever imagined."
4,Solid Album,"This is a well crafted album, through and through. I originally purchased it 4 years ago, gave it away to a college roomate, and have repurchased. Perfect for background music, dancing and especially going running. Tracks 4-6 build great energy and are the core of the album. Buy it, and you won't be dissapointed."
4,Plenty of Good Stuff Here!,"This CD was recorded in July 1995 in Hollywood California and is somewhat unique today in that it is a pure analog recording. All tracks, with the possible exception of 3, were recorded direct to two track for that live club feeling. All tracks feature Ry Cooder on guitar and most feature Jim Keltner on drums.The disc itself has a laidback soulful feel which seems typical for slide master Ry Cooder. The standout tracks are J.B. Lenoir's ""Down In Mississippi"" and Terry's own ""Blues No More"" both slow, smooth, soulful and performed with a lot of feeling. On the downside, the CD would get along just fine without ""Money In Your Pocket"" which sounds an awful lot like the old ""Put The Lime In The Coconut"". Over all, with the exception of ""Money"", this is a fine CD with a lot to offer the listener."
2,"not a review of the book itself, but the kindle edition","This is not a review of the book itself, but of the formatting of the book for the Kindle. I was shocked at the number of misspellings and punctuation errors throughout the Kindle edition I read. Two completely misspelled words within the same paragraph, sentences frequently ending with no punctuation whatsoever, commas and dashes dropped into words and sentences at random... I might expect this from one of the ""free"" public domain books, since they are formatted by volunteers, but presumably since I paid for this ebook, someone was paid to format it. If Penguin is in need of a proofreader for its ebooks, I'm available!! Interestingly enough, I read People of the Book, also by Geraldine Brooks on my Kindle and found no such errors.Have any other Kindle readers encountered this problem? Is it just this particular book?"
5,A Poignant Awakening,"Truly a brilliant book. Well-deserving of the Pulitzer Prize, and a welcome addition to this category of conflict history."
1,Plot moves at a snail's pace; boring; hated the ending; I read it for our Book Club; otherwise I would never have finished it.,Plot moves at a snail's pace; boring; hated the ending; I read it for our Book Club; otherwise I would never have finished it.
2,Very thin story.,Glossed over so many subjects that could have been covered in much greater detail. No sense of time in the writing ..it seemed to me the author was in a hurry to finish the book or keep the pages down so as not to scare off a mass audience who will not buy books that are too long.
3,Writing was excellent. Subject was unsympathetic.,"I don't mean to sound so harsh. I love Geraldine Brook's writing. She doesn't disappoint. Her words paint a vivid picture of the setting and history of the Civil War -- from the March's house in Connecticut to the Virginia farm where he struggles to survive.My problem with this book is just that I am not really interested in Mr. March. I find him to be whiney, boring and just not compelling. I think Louisa May Alcott was right to focus on the girls and ignore Mr. March. I understand that he's the vehicle by which we experience the real hardship of the war and the social upheaval of slave ownership, but I think the attempt to make him a conflicted person turns the book a little melodramatic.That said, it was definitely worth reading. If we are comparing, I liked Year of Wonders much more."
2,HOW did this book win a Pullitzer Prize?,"I am shocked and dismayed that the Pullitzer Prize was awarded to March by Geraldine Brooks. The information about the brutality of the Civil War is impressive and there are beautifully written passages, but the storyline is like a soap opera or made-for-TV movie. Can anyone who ever read ""Little Women"" imagine Marmie making love on the shores of Walden Pond, before marriage, with Minister March???? And that's not all. . .I just read this for my book club and there was not one person (out of 20 and a paid leader) who could justify the award given to this book."
2,disappointing,"I had very high expectations for this book given her other book. Both my wife and I could not finish it and gave up half way through it. it is extremely well written, but I got to the point that i just did not care what happened to the main character."
1,do anything else but read this dribble,"I am in total agreement with all of the 1 star reviewer's especially AVID READER ""cj"". I read alot of Civil War books and the main character in this book needed to man up. i was shocked that this won the Pulitzer. So disappointed. If your looking for Civil War read Howard Bahr's works, and Cold Mountain!"
5,The father in Little Women,"The father in Louisa May Alcott'sLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)was a chaplain with the Union troops during the first part of that book. This is his story, a committed abolitionist who joined the war effort as a moral cause."
1,Cosmi installs Spyware!,Do not buy this or any Cosmi or Starshine software. It installs Spyware on your computer and it will take an expert to get rid of it. Don't make the same mistake I did!
2,"So VERY pretty, but.....","I've never had the stemware, only the flat-bottomed drink glasses. They are exceptionally lovely and will beautifully grace a bar or table. However, but, comma -- they are easily chipped and the four I bought for Christmas are now down to two and there are no kids in the household to blame.And no, I've never put mine in the dishwasher. I don't think that is good for lead crystal."
2,and for THIS you gave up baryshnikov???,"there were three of these movies all at the same time; ""places in the heart"" and ""the river"" were the other two. this is the one with jessica lange, instead of the one with sally field or the one with sissy spacek. if you liked one of the other two, you will like this one."
4,I love this CD,OK I'm only a gringo. I bought the CD at a kitchen store and never expected it to be so addictive. I love it. Ven a Medellin and La Vida Es Un Carnival are great. Really there are only good cuts on this CD. ¡Disfrutelo!
2,Turgid and disappointing,"Not a fun or easy read. It's disappointing both because it's an interesting topic that fails to be well written and organized, and because the snappy graphics make it seem like more fun than it is. Note that I'm giving it 2 stars on its own merits, as if I (an adult with a PhD) had picked it up to read for my own interest. I'm only reading it because my 14-year old was assigned it for summer reading -- think I'll give her science teacher zero stars!"
5,tommy boy,"If you like crystalware these are fine glasses suitable for about any kind of wine. We just put them in the dishwasher with the other dishes and they still look great, no etching."
5,wine glasses,"Approximaqtely a third of the retail price because the box had been opened, but in new condition. Exactly what I needed and very fast delivery, but they were 7 1/2 oz size not 5 3/4. Didn't matter as I needed four of either size."
5,High impact artwork,"""See the life through the eyes of an artist, and the art through the eyes of life."""
4,Not bad...,"I did the opposite of what everyone says I should do. I watched the movie first, then I dedicated myself to the books. I bought ""The Hard Goodbye"" yesterday and read it. I was pretty impressed with it. It was a good introduction to the Sin City books and definitely sets the stage for what's to come. Think I'll see what ""A Dame To Kill For"" has to offer..."
1,Acapulco Gold,"My husband was in this movie. He grades it as a ""5 star"" but that his ego. He says that while it's not the greatest movie, not everyone can say they were actually in a movie. He played a mexican federal cop.The Acapulco Gold version he was in was made in Hawaii."
2,clumsy writing,"I'm going to reluctantly disagree with the other reviewers here and say that while this is, indeed, a massively researched reference book, as a biography it is clumsy and awkward. Time and again narrative is sacrificed for detail. I began skimming after 100 pages and finally gave up and gave the book to the local library thrift shop."
2,Nazi Atrocitites,This is nothing but an old U.S. Department of Defense movie telling about the rise of the Axis powers. An old movie with a new cover. There's no atrocities as it states.
1,Do not buy,"I bought two of these bags after reading good reviews to give as gifts for my little brothers. Both the bags had dirt stains on the light blue part and they were very visible. At first I thought it was part of the design, but it wasn't. It was clear that these were either old bags left in a place where they could accumulate dust or they were manufacturing defects. They looked like a good deal since they were cheap but ended up being a big disappointment. I could not return the bags because I only found out the defects after i had left the US and was in India. I could take them back and return them but it's a hell of a painful process to take them back to the US. So, I guess I will just let the seller save some money and get away with poor customer service. :( I only wish the seller had checcked the bags before sending them, this experience has drastically reduced my trust on the quality of products on amazon or atleast by this seller."
3,does not look good as picture,"The bag is OK but doesn't look as good as picture. It is durable and comfortable however mine the light blue material has dark stains all over and can't be cleaned so I returned the bag. By the way, the return service at Amazon is excellent and free."
5,"Excellent movie, Fast shipping!",The movie is very good and in excellent condition. It was shipped fast too! Thanks!
1,VERY Dissapointing!!!,"As a fan of Sean's picking and musicianship this CD was one of the biggest dissapointments ever. I was expecting to hear at least a few tight, technical flat pick runs ... instead I got a bunch of tunes that sound like washed up drivel from the latest pop Christian rock CD. Even when Sean did decide to do some good picking most of the time he overdubbed a tenor sax on the run so you couldn't even hear him ... an extremely cheesey sound is what you get. I kept skipping each track hoping to hear something decent, but every song made me want to hurl ... litteraly. You might like this CD if you are into Matchbox 20 and The GooGoo Dolls, but if you're looking for good new acoustic music along the lines of Mike Marshall and Bryan Sutton don't buy this borring, depressing CD."
1,Neo-Canadianism??,"While the book is written in a jerky and almost incoherent style, the most surprising thing is it's intentional distortion of war history to make the US look bad. Only Canadians get to be good guys in this book, and one has to wonder why this was needful.Another weakness is in the psychology of the villains of the piece. Throw your textbooks out the window budding young psychologists! The Clarke's have reinvented abnormal psychology!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"Being a big fan of Slade, I really tried to like this latest outing but it just doesn't measure up to the previous works. All of the books in the series interweave a ""historical"" perspective into the plot but in ""Swastika"" the perspective overshadowed the plot. Typically, Inspector deClerq and his crew carry the plot quite well and themselves are interesting characters. The Special X squad had very little to do in this novel which is disappointing. I would like to see Slade get back to the style of the earlier novels like ""Headhunter"", ""Ghoul"", etc. These stories had a better balance of plot and exposition."
2,Uneven Horror Flick,"This movie is about a struggling young artist that is the apprentice or servant of an accomplished female artist that just happens to be a vampire, what what she paint with is blood and it is the apprentice's job to get her victims for her. Parts of this movie is good and original, other parts just do not work. It try to mix 1970's psychedelic and artsy vampire movie with humor and it just do not work. I do not know what to think about this movie. I got it cheap and it did entertain me, but I am just left with the feeling what a mess when I think about this movie. If you are a big fan of bad horror movies and vampire films you might get something out of this, just be warned before you spend your cash that this movies is strange and at places just idiotic."
1,"Too short, too much talking, not enough explosions","Dont waste your money on this DVD, I wasnt impressed even on the first viewing. There are very few explosions which arnt that powerful anyway and too much talking. Some guy just picked up a handy cam at a demonstration and decided to make some money out of it by publishing it. You get more on Youtube than this DVD."
3,Terrific road maps,"For map junkies, this is a beautiful product. This was a great aid for the driving parts of our New England fall color trip & I highly recommend it for that purpose. It also made finding trail heads for hiking easier. For biking, these maps have important limitations. It was impossible to read elevations off the contour lines. Photocopies of the maps to take on a bike ride as a route guide often did not reproduce the smaller back roads because they are represented by too fine a line. But this varies from page to page and between the Vermont & the New Hampshire atlas. Our Vermont Atlas seemed to use thicker lines than the New Hampshire Atlas. Our much older Oregon Atlas is even worse in this regard. A competing atlas is much better at least for Oregon."
1,Exreme Engineering Collection 1,"I am a high school teacher. I bought this movie for my physics class. I had to turn it off about ten minutes into it because of all the horrible language that was in it. Yes, it was bleeped out, but the students knew exactly what was being said. Horrible for a classroom. I thought Discover was better than that!"
1,Might be so basic it's not worth your time,"If you're looking for solid guidance as an executer or fiduciary, go elsewhere. ""How to Settle and Estate"" is the better choice. The handbook gives a scant 7 pages of practical advice on what to do if/when someone close has died. Things like: Contact the funeral director, determine your parent's wishes concerning the funeral, ascertain whether your parents have already paid for their funeral, notify friends, locate the original copy of the will - - you get the idea. I was very disappointed especially given the glowing reviews provided by others."
5,Presidential Agent By Upton Sinclair,"The entire series is now available for the first time in 60 plus years in hardbound, single book copy, except for the second book, Between Two Worlds. They are published in beautiful crimson color with added text from the first book World's End. Contact us at uptonsinclairinstitute.com for more informatiuon."
5,Love this!,"Noodle and Boo is my absolutely favorite of all baby bath products! It smells so sweet (just like a baby should smell!) and the soap and shampoo are not drying at all. After receiving this for a shower gift, I now use it exclusively!"
1,AVOID if you have Windows XP,"Don't waste your money on this game. It would be better to just throw your money in the trash and not risk harm to your computer. Not only did it not work at times leaving me with a black screen at start up, it would also go totally black in the middle of a game and I would have to drag the mouse over the entire screen to make the picture reappear. I love Scrabble, but not this game!!"
1,Scrabble,"This game is a waste of time and money. Doesn't work with WindowsXP, all I got was a blank screen. Save time and download from gateway games."
1,No support for Windows NT (so far),"I have yet to get my scanner running. Maybe I shouldn't have taken it for granted that the product would run on a Windows NT OS. I could even live with the fact that it would use the drivers from Windows 98 and I would lose some performance. But the setup programs alerts me that it doesn't support NT, and then promptly quits.Something, somewhere, whether on the Amazon.com website, or on the product package, or in the requirements listing, should let you know that it is not compatible with Windows NT. But it doesn't."
4,Magnetic mount XM antenna,"The antenna works very well, is small and very easy to install. The wire is small enough in diameter to stuff under the weather stripping around my windshield and door frame. I routed the wire under the dashboard trim and only about 3"" of the wire is visible leading to the radio. The antenna is located right next to the windshield weather stripping in the center of my roof. Most people don't even notice it. It's very small.The antenna works very well. Signals are strong and I only experience signal interruptions when I'm downtown with tall buildings around due to the low angle of the satellite in my location (eastern Iowa).The magnet is very strong and it doesn't move even going through an automatic car wash.My first concern was if the antenna would hold up with our midwest thunderstorms and harsh winters. NO PROBLEM.It's a great buy at $14.95 considering that Best Buy gets $40 for the same unit!It's a good product and does exactly what it's supposed to do."
2,Contains negligent misleading information,"I bought an earlier edition of this book, along with Hiking Wyoming by the same publisher.I didn't get to either of those states yet to try out any of the hikes but I did notice that both books contain the identical information about bears -they don't distinguish between black and grizzly bears and the advice they give is TOTALLY WRONG for black bears and likely to get someone killed!They clearly didn't do their research properly (if at all) in this case - I hope the rest of the book is better quality!"
5,"Wonderful, cultural, family book",I enjoy this book as much as my daughter does. It's refreshing to see the many ways parents around the world carry their children with them and involve them in the adults' daily activities. I also like that my daughter sees a book reflecting other cultures and grows up with more of a global sense rather than being US-centric.
4,"Fluidity, speed and emphasis","It has been a privilege to hear Scarlatti vol. 1 with Eteri Andjapararidze, vol. 2 with Michael Lewin and vol. 3 (this album) with Jeno Jando on the piano. Although it would have been better to hear these works on their written instrument, the harpsichord, I have had a fascinating afternoon.With regard to Jeno Jando, his interpretation of Scarlatti is characterized by its fluidity, speed and emphasis. He abandons the staccato style of Lewin and he does not bring in 20th century interpretations of 17th century material as in vol. 1.This is yet a 20th century creation but it brings to the Baroque a new style which is not to be ignored. Jando does not bring out bouncing rhythms - he uses his left hand in conjunction with the right to bring out emphasis.On the whole, this is a superior album but for true Scarlatti fans, it is important to have ALL the albums in this series."
5,Manuel Puig's Unrecognized Masterpiece,"The tale of ""Heartbreak Tango"" is a captivating web spun out of the spider-threads of the inhabitants' lives in a small Argentinian town.Touching, humerous, and filled with the sadness of human emotional attachments, Puig has created a magnificent look into the life of a veritable ""Don Juan."" An extremely good read!"
1,Photo instructions are bad,"I have been doing intermediate Pilates for about 18 months now. I saw this book in a store and was curious about it, so I picked it up and started flipping through it. I was shocked to see that in each photo, Denise has her head turned, grinning at the camera instead of actually putting her head in the proper position for the move. Head position is essential to all the moves, and I don't know very many that involve turning one's head to one side and smiling widely! LOL Anyway, to be fair once I saw that I didn't read any of the book. Maybe she makes up for it in the written descriptions. But that photo faux pas was enough to make me put down the book and not look back. I can't believe some editor let that book get published that way! It could be a great book for all I know, but just those photos were enough to make me cringe!"
2,More quiet than a jet engine.,"I thought combining the blender and food processor in one machine was a good idea. It probably still is, just not with this machine. As a blender, this machine works fine. As a food processor, it is largely limited to being a food chopper. Even that would be fine, but this thing is loud. Loud as in someone screaming in your ear, or like standing on the tarmac at the airport. Seriously, ear protection should come with this machine."
1,waste of money,I bought this tripod along with the 18n volt rotary laser. i was getting ready to install a chair rail and wasted a good 1/2 hour to 45 min trying to line up the right hieght with the laser.i would recommend buying an elevator tipod .
4,"First one bad, rest good","The organism loose on the ship episode was horrible. I suggest just moving past it on the DVD. However, the episode with the chess pieces was great - an excellent story, and with a nice twist. The humor was back in this one, and none of it forced. A good buy, really."
1,Nice marketing...,"Don't buy this if you are thinking you are purchasing a ""portable vise"". Although the product is called the QUICK-VISE Portable Vise, the packaging is very deceiving. I bought this product thinking I could ""use it anywhere"" like it says on the box. You certainly can use it anywhere so long as you are willing to use 4 screws to keep it in place.However, there is an accessory (that they conveniently put a picture of on the packaging) that makes the vise ""even more"" portable. But be sure to read the fine print, as the QUICK-VISE Portable Workbench Attachment, as it is called, is not included. I purchased the accessory, thinking that it would solve my problem (it didn't).Unfortunately, the accessory only allows you more freedom of placement so long as you either: (a) use it with the Black & Decker Workmate Workbench or (b) drill 3/4"" holes in your bench."
3,the vital accessories,"The workmate accessory requires the base piece to function, so you may want to get both the extra base and the workmate adapter if you want to attach to your workmate.From the manufacturer's website ...("
1,Not made to last,"I had some projects that needed pocket hole screws so I thought I'd save some money and get this instead of the Kreg one that costs $125. Well the concept of this jig is simple enough, and it would be great if the drill bit was made from stronger material. After drilling about 12 pocket holes through MDF, the 1/8"" tip broke off the bit. Without the bit this whole thing is useless. I tried to find out if there was any kind of warranty, but from what I could tell, this company doesn't even mention the word ""Warranty"". So since I plan on doing many more of these types of projects, I decided to step up to the plate and get the Kreg pro kit. It works great. Get an extra bit just in case though, cause without one your project comes to a screeching hault. So far my Kreg bit has drilled many more pocket holes without any problem."
5,"Great, Great, Great",i found that this book explained everything i needed to know as a first time XML coder...Holzner doese a great job with every aspect of the topics addressed.i found it easy to read and in most cases i had to force myself to put it down...he really knows how to put it into a bigginers perspective..only topic i wish he would address is ColdFusion and transforming XML to application data using WDDX.overall if you want to know XML this is the book for you...
5,exceptionally well written,"I think, learing a technology is best possible, if it is explained in an interesting, clear and organized manner. This book does just that. The details are great, the style is even excellent. This is a must buy for anyone who wants to learn basic, intermediate, and many advanced features of XML.I rate this, one of the best XML books I have."
1,High Thud Factor; Low on Content,"It appears I am in the minority with my opinion of this book, but I'll state it anyway.The book is too broad with the result that it doesn't cover anything in sufficient detail. An example of this is four chapters that are heavily Java based (""Creating Variables in Java"" and so on). If I had wanted a Java Programming book, I would have bought one. The space should have been put to use covering XML Schemas (or many other topics) in much greater detail.My second complaint is that Mr. Holzner was apparently paid by the word for this one so he repeats examples over and over, just highlighting different lines. This means that packing this title in your carry-on may well result in an excess baggage fee.It looks impressive in the bookcase, though, and if that's your reason for buying, don't let me stop you."
3,"Good book, but ludicrously padded.","This is a good book for learning the theory and applications of XML. Unfortunately (I assume at the publisher's demand), the book has been tremendously padded. I'd estimate that there are only 300 pages of real content. The rest is endlessly repeated XML examples, with trivial changes for each repetition. I've taken to highlighting useful passages, because they are so far apart."
4,"If you want poetry, read poetry.","I don't agree with the below reviewer's approach. If you want to judge an album you don't merely grab the inlay card, read the lyrics and that's that. It seems that's what she/he did. What about the music? I don't find the lyrics too trite anyway. Karine Polwart has a great voice and can write great songs. Nothing groundbreaking, of course, but it is a consistently enjoyable contemporary folk album."
2,Disappointing,"There are some nice images, but the film has no story.Natural History is a very competitive genre these days and this film simply does not even stand up to the average."
5,Great learning tool of the PACIFIC!,After first seeing this film on Discovery channel I was blown away by the beauty and life which inhabits alot of these Islands. Being from Hawaii it made me appreciate where I live and it gave me an insight to what Hawaii had looked like in the past and what it could become if we take care of it. This is a well made film with great shots and makes you feel like your actually there. Great QUALITY and well worth 30 dollars.Aloha
4,Spectacular showcase of an exotic world,"I have not yet managed to view this entire video because I just started viewing it for the first time, and am finding some of the footage so incredibly mind-blowing that it cannot all be taken in one viewing!This series reminds me of the NATURE program called ""Nomads of the Wind"" from the 90s. That program seemed a little better to me in terms of its organization, focusing on one island group at a time (eg, Hawaii, Samoa, New Zealand) and explaining how humans and other creatures arrived at each of these areas and colonized them, in a most dramatic fashion.Nevertheless, this show appears to be equally fascinating, and to present similar subject matter in a somewhat different way, as well as showing a few things I did not see in the older program.Excellent show!"
5,An intimate portrayal of a foreign life.,"As an English as a Second Language instructor, the account by Helie Lee of her grandmother's life enilightened me. Many Korean women have passed through our doors for instruction in English as a way to becoming self-sufficient in a somewhat cruel world. Clearly, Helie's book in her grandmother's voice speaks volumes to those of us who try to understand and instruct those who cross the thresholds of the familiar."
3,Interesting story; Annoying characters,"This book provides an interesting glimpse into the extreme circumstances of Hongyong Baek's life. But I was annoyed from the beginning after reading the self-congratulatory preface. The actual story about her grandmother was fascinating. But the author was clearly VERY proud of her grandmother, which seemed to make the character arrogant and hypocritical. And when she writes about herself but in her grandmother's voice, it's just a shameful, distracting mess. The events though were interesting enough for me to grudgingly finish the book."
3,Still playing,"I had some problems with this game, but only when I try to use it on a new mac, playing in classic mode. The older the machine, the better this works. I now only play the game using my old clamshell imac, and it works great. The secret, I think, is to use it only on systems that boot up in 9, not in X.Anyway, as the game goes, it's not that spectatular, certainly not compared to what's out there now, but it is servicable and can be fun. I'm the type who enjoys a challenge and doesn't need too many graphics to spice up a game (and there are some fun tournament settings which can keep on occupied with competition) so this game works fine for me."
3,light and pretty,this lightweight necklace makes a very pretty statement..it adds just the right 'punch' to any solid basic colored ensemble...
4,Windwalker,I just love this movie. I had it in VHS and found it on DVD and had to have it. It is a decent family movie with no profanity and sexual scenes. We need more movies like this.
5,The best family viewing,I took my children to see this movie when it was first released. We all loved it. When VCR's became popular I looked for the movie in all the stores but of course was never able to find it. I was glad to purchase it on line. My son watches it over and over again. My only complaint is the quality of the tape. I am hoping that it will be remastered onto DVD with a better picture quality so I can keep on enjoying it with my grandchildren.
4,Renewed Long ago Rememberances,"We saw Windwalker when it was first in the theaters. Enjoyed it then and enjoyed it now. I am sure we will watch this movie many times. We highly reccommend it. Although there is some historical violence, we reccommend this as a family movie because it shows strong family values."
4,Useful tool,"I run an educational advising center, and the Fiske book is one of the most popular tools in my library. Students can look at any other book to see what classes are offered at various colleges, but what they often want and need to know is what will life be like when they get there. Often, parents and students are too hung-up on the reputation and image of certain schools and forget that the physical and mental well-being of a student also makes a difference in grades. This book tells you about the social life on campus, about the localities where the schools are located, about the student body, about the professors... all essential information. The only criticism I would have is that too few schools are included in the book, even if it is already quite thick, and often Fiske excludes some schools which are either of high-quality or in great demand."
3,Difficult to read,"I feel that this guide is not as helpful as The Princeton Review. The format makes it difficult to look up a particular college, and consortium colleges are all listed together, not necessarily in alphabetical order. Some entries are too wordy and I often skimmed through them. I found the star rating system to be somewhat of a nuisance, overall not the best book out there, but a good second or third companion."
1,Description inaccurate,Amazon info does not indicate that an expensive system controller is required for this motion sensor to function. Is not stand-alone.
5,Works Great,The additional motion sensors are very easy to add to your Skylink Alarm system and they have a much greater range than the older models. Same batteries have lasted 6 months now and still working great.
3,can't have pets with this motion sensor,our two cats kept setting off the alarm because of this motion sensor. The skylink overall is nice if you don't have pets. If they add a better motion sensor that it an excellent alarm system.
2,Repeated false alarms!,"I've purchased several PS-434A Motion Sensors to expand my SC-1000 system, but unfortunately I found that repeated false alarms made these sensors virtually useless. Doesn't matter where you put the sensors in your house (high or low sensitivity) sooner or later you'll get a false alarm. Currently I'm keeping them inside of closets. I guess if burglars get into my house the closets are the first places where they will be looking for valuables.I also found that PS-434A Motion Sensors working as advertised only in ""Delay Mode"". When the sensors are in ""Instant Mode"" they are only able to set off audio alarm at Control Panel SC-001, but AD-433S Emergency Dialer is not dialing (!?!).Just to be sure that nothing was wrong with my Control Panel or Emergency Dialer I also tested WT-433 Window/Door Sensors. They've worked in Delay and Instant Mode without any problems."
3,Could be better...,"Well, I'll admit I have only given this album about 5 GOOD listens. But I find that this album is nowhere near the interesting, evolving melodic soundscapes that I have come to expect from U-Ziq. I can't imagine why Amazon customers have rated this CD as U-Ziq's best. It is good, but FAR from his best. It is essentially two EPs worth of extra, leftover music from Mike Paradinas crammed together to make 1 'album'.These songs strike me as too abrassive, and are less complex and melodic than U-Ziq's other releases. If you are looking for intelligent beats, interesting sounds and great melodies, check out Lunatic Harness or In Pine Effect first.While I'm at it, I will also suggest Aphex Twin's releases I Care Because You do, the Richard D. James Album, and Selected Ambient Works 89-92. These are all worth 5 stars, as is U-Ziq's Lunatic Harness and In Pine Effect."
5,Lion in Winter purchased at Amazon.,"This is a classic. What else could it be? Peter O'Toole, Katharine Hepburn and others guide you back into a era of Kings and their Ladies, who plot and plan the future of England. If you don't watch it at least once, you will have missed an excellent movie."
2,Hear me roar.,"Wordy examination of England's Angevin dynasty. Playwright James Goldman insists on having his characters, especially Henry II and his estranged wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, howl at each other like banshees, generally. Problem is, we're so removed from the historical context of the story that we wonder what all the screeching and sobbing is about. The cumulative effect is one of ghastly overacting rather than catharsis. As has been noted elsewhere in these reviews, Katherine Hepburn in particular is a big offender: it seems we're expected to feel sorry for Ms. Hepburn because she's growing old. This is the sort of cheap tactic that secures Oscars. A final thought: the director, Anthony Harvey, might have overcome his fondness for zooming the camera shots in from great distances."
2,"sound and fury, signifying nothing","Alas, this film has not held up well over the years. It is an overacted and convoluted emotional mess, a bit like ""Wuthering Heights"" on steroids. For all its blustering, it goes nowhere. This movies attempts to tell the story of Eleanor of Aquitaine and other historical personages, which I grant you is no easy task. However, has there ever been such melodrama? This is almost as silly as a Strinberg play, with cheesy cinematography to boot."
5,Deeply moving.,"The Lion in Winter is a breath of fresh air. I just happened to come across this classic film on t.v. one night and boy this movie is a masterpiece. Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are flawless! Their acting abilities are top-notch, no wonder critics swoon over both these talented thespians. I highly recommend this medieval treasure, enjoy!"
1,The Lion in Winter,"Stay away from this sleeper. Boring plot, very wierd and incestial character situation. Our English IV teacher showed us this movie and we couldn't stay awake.Chris"
5,A must have for any movie fan!,"I have been searching for this movie for the past 3 years! Katherine Hepburn is absolutely spectacular in this film. She is vindictive and conniving in one scene, then heartbreakingly vulnerable in the next. This film truly is a triumph of excellent acting. I cannot wait to see it again..."
1,Worst staple gun ever,"After several repairs, numerous cleanings (sand), and weeks of trying to install 1000+ sf of insulation in a crawl space the staple gun had to be replaced. Several years of former Stanley products is now wrapped up in the nightmare of this staple gun."
2,Book is a little light in real information...,"This book was a little light in practical information, as could be expected for a pre-beta book. If it were my money, I would wait and buy the MS Press Introduction to .Net My Services coming out this spring, since it will be based on the latest spring code release of the .NET My Services SDK. Hailstorm, or .NET My Services, does sound like a great idea, and I am looking forward to finding out more when the beta SDK goes public. That code will probably be more useful to a developer than the code in this book."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS EXIT PLANET DUST,"DIG YOUR OWN HOLE is not as good as exit planet dust. I believe that THE CHEMICAL BROTHERS have SADLY ENOUGH, SOLD OUT! they are not really sticking to their usually 'underground' sound. turn on the radio and it all sounds the same. too bad the chemical bro's have fallen into the main stream! if you want a GREAT chemical bro's C.D., BUY 'EXIT PLANET DUST' not this one."
2,"Not for the fans of fast,loud music","The best of three crap albums.Yes,this is the most dancable Chemical Bros. album.But no,it fails to please me and I recommend you don't buy this.The last 3 tunes are NOT dance tunes,the other 9 are borderline ... dance tunes-except track 1 and 3 which are okay.I have now learnt that I don't like the Chemical Brothers and that they are nothing like the Prodigy which I hoped they would've been.Their only good track was Hey Boy Hey Girl from Surrender."
4,got it love it,"Ambient and trippy, every tune lifts you up, but the Private Psychadelic Reel rates as one of the best mood enchncers of all time - check this out."
3,Not as good as their last album,"Try ""Exit planet dust"", all the songs on that album are as good as for example ""Block rockin' beats"" or ""Dig your own hole"". Not bad, though."
1,"Art is great, delivery was terrible","The quality of the art and poster is exactly what I was hoping for, so no complaints there at all.My issue is that I paid extra in shipping by selecting the 2 day delivery option, guaranteeing my purchase to arrive on or before December 24th. Was this a last-minute Christmas gift? Without question! Do I understand the volume of packages around Christmas time? Probably only minimally, meaning I can appreciate that there is incredibly high volume of packages floating around at Christmas time, but the option I selected and the service I paid for said I would receive my package before Christmas. Instead, I received it on January 17th. This has left me very unsatisfied with the process of purchasing my gift from amazon.com and less willing to use this service in the future."
4,The Goons 2,"I enjoyed this tremendously. I laughed while I listened. I did try listening to it in the car , but you don't get the same effect. I wish some radio station would air the Goon Show episodes again. I felt like I was actually in the time, listening to them at home on my radio. The characters are hilarious. Eccles is my fav.. Cheers !!!! Guys you were great..."
5,delighted 8 year old twins & their tough 11 year old brother,Checked this book out from the local library & we all loved it so much that I have ordered a copy for my kids for Christmas. It's just so funny & quirky--you'll never feel the same going into Krispy Kreme again. I can't wait for Laurie Keller to put another book out there! COntinued success to her!
5,Quite Enjoyable,"I rather enjoyed the Japanese seiyuu in this anime, as well as the animation quality."
5,Great DVD!,"If you've watched Gundam or Gundam Wing before, you'll like it for sure. If you haven't seen it, you'll like it for sure too! Getting the Gundam Wing series on DVD is a lot better than getting them on tape. The menu in the dvd looks like the inside of a Gundam cockpit. There aren't really any special features, but that's ok because the best part about a DVD is that it has great picture quality, and it will stay like that. Anyway, the last DVD has 1 less episode than the others, but it has more special features. The first set has these five episodes:------------------------------------The Shooting Star She SawThe Gundam DeathscytheFive Gundams ConfirmedThe Victoria NightmareRelena's Secret------------------------------------You won't regret getting the first one, and then you'll want all 10 DVDs in the series! That's what happened to me. Look for my reviews in the other DVDs too."
4,Pretty good!,"Mourning September's first cd is pretty good. The first two songs are the best on the cd. Some of the other songs are good, but not overaly awesome. All and all a pretty well done cd."
1,Certainly not for professional developers!,"After reading through this book, I was not sure if this book is focused on Java programming or XML or Servlets and JSP programming, although it claims to be about how to integrate all these technologies together. The book overall is not very well organized and it is tough sometimes to really make out what the authors are trying to convey. As for the example code, it is not difficult to make out that the authors are from academia and certainly are not developers who hack it out in the real world."
1,Not a very good book,I think the author does not need to go into parsing and EBNF to explain a simple idea as XML. There are too many chapters wasted on irrelevant material and a lengthy appendix. The book lacks a good chapter on XML and DTDs. I found the one XML chapter in the Java Server Programming book more useful than this entire book.
2,So Confusing and Misleading,"This book disappointed me so much, i thought that i will get the best of it when it comes to Java, XML, and JSP with database. On the other hand, the authours spent so much pages talking about things that are not worthy and only theories. No depth on any of the covered subjects. I agree with the reviewers who said that it makes the reader work hard. i had to pass through many chapters just to get a simple implementation idea. Too wordy for nothing."
3,THE SIERRA CD-ROM STORY,HI MY NAME IS JAMES DIXON AND I LIKE HALLMARK ANDHOYLE CD-ROMS THE MOST I LIKE ABOUT HALLMARK ISTHAT I GET TO MAKE CARDS AND ENVOLOPES TO PUT THEMIN.THE THING I LIKE MOST ABOUT HOYLE IS THEREDIFFERENT KINDS OF GAMES TO PLAY BON THERE LIKECHESS OR DOMINOES.
5,Great LP** But Who the hell is Amazon employing,"time and again, title tracks are totally misspelled. who the hell is amazon employing?"
2,Two and a half stars actually. Good but not great.,"Don't believe the hype. It's a good album, but you'll find the same style and inspiration in any Record Town/Sam Goody techno compilation repository. However...When I bought the B-boys ""Sounds of Science"" I was disappointed to see that they let this joker remix ""Body Movin'"". ""What sacrelige"", I thought, but it is a very good remix and I believe FS is capable of MUCH more than he has shown. Summary: Don't spend your own money on this album, borrow it for a day."
1,Better Living Through Not Buying This CD,"This is too bad to fully comprehend. Its not even music. Try to imagine slow rap without lyrics, and youll get something of an idea of how stupefyingly bad this CD is. You can actually FEEL yourself getting dumber as you listen to it. The only way to enjoy this is by taking heavy doses of Nitrous Oxide or Mescaline before listening. Why else would it be called ""Better Living Through Chemistry""?"
1,i wish i could rate this lower,this is a horrible cd. fat boy slim has for a long time corrupted our music with his mainstream whorthless crap and ive had enough. i sat buy idly until he remixed smells like teen spirit. he ruined a perfect song and runed it into a worthless funk song. i think the populace should boycote his junk to purge the airways of tthis low level crap.
3,Disappointed,"As a magnifying glass it is perfectly good. However, I asked for LED magnifying glasses. This glass should not have been included."
2,A product that Lucas would be proud of,"The magnifier performs as intended. But the light? It has a two-position switch with three settings: dim, flicker, and off."
4,Works Well,It is big with a built in light and a small inset that is more powerful than the rest of the lens. Works well.
3,Excellent Reading Tool But....,"This magnifying glass is a high quality tool that can be used for reading or any other purpose related to visual enlargement of ordinary objects. The self-lighted feature is especially handy. However, it is offered in a category for 10X magnification power which is not the case since the main glass is only 2X power. It does have a smaller inset with 4X power, but it's not large enough for reading. So although the design of this glass is excellent, it gets only an average rating from me because of the misleading advertising."
4,Lighted Magnifier,This was OK. It does magnify but smaller magnifying glasses I bought for a dollar at Walgreens magnify better. The light is not very bright and hardly helps. I do use it.
5,Pretty Well Designed,"Light weight, plastic lens protected by bezel when sitting on a table. Nice LED light."
2,Lighted Magnifier,It's difficult finding a good quality magnifier. The magnification lens in this product tends to distort - not a good quality lens at all. The handle and lens frame are pretty cheaply made as well. It probably won't last very long before it falls apart. The 2 AAA batteries do make it a little heavy. I wouldn't buy this product again.
3,Good Lens - Weak Lamp,"The magnifier itself is decent quality and a nice size. The light on the one I received glows white when you are looking directly at it, but is far too weak to use to illuminate whatever you are looking at."
2,Not a very happy combination of songs...,"There are better and more powerful songs in their discography than what this package offered.Also,the tracks from 'Out of This World'(1988)have a very weak sound ,while the acoustic version of'I'll Cry For You'is totally inferior to the electric one.For those just getting to know this band ,this collection is a tad misleading."
5,"Awesome, buy it!!!","This is money well spent and I would do it again. I bought the book and started reading it right from the get go it helps. I knew I was making some mistakes I wasnt picking up in my dating life and this book clued me right in. I starting dating someone two weeks after I had started reading this book. We are now a couple of months in and we havent even had a disagreement. This book teaches you how to communicate with the opposite sex about everything and anything in a way that is accepted. It teaches you to focus on ""what you need and want"" without losing yourself in the new relationship. This is the first time I am dating someone and still enjoying my separate social life with a great guy in my life too. This book is a jackpot of great information. My guy thought I connected with him so well he went to the library to get a copy to see what was so interesting about it. He learned great things from the book.....thank you, thank you."
2,not enough example helps,"I was under the impression that this book was written by Christian Carter. It didn't give ideas of things to say or do to keep the man. Would have rather had much more insight to a mans reasoning of why they won't go farther than the dating thing, and being content to stay that way in the relationship. My man has said he deeply cares for me, What does that mean? This book was disapointing to me."
1,Too Technical Too Borring,"Dumb book, too borring. Better off reading ""The Rules"", much more entertaining."
4,Sizes Run Big,Very comfortable but I'm a 32 waist and got the mediums and I'm swimming in them. The draw string is one continuous piece. So it's difficult to tie a knot to compensate. But then again I'm not a sailor.
2,"""Sweat"" pants???","As per usual the delivery time for most things through amazon is speedy, sometimes damn impressive even without paying extra for expediteted shipping... As for the product though... I'm not sure if it's just me, but when I think of ""sweatpants"", I tend to have an image in mind of a fairly thick and durable material with a nice stretchy waistband... What I got was basically paper thin medium quality pants, and the drawstring broke the second time I wore them... I'd pass on these unless you can't afford other leggings to cover you're own arse."
2,flawed drawstring,"These sweats have a simple flaw: if the end of the drawstring gets pulled into the waistband (say, during washing), they're ruined. There is no way get the end back out so you can tie them and there isn't even a knot to prevent this from happening. Unless you want to tear them apart yourself, they're now only good for washing windows and drying dishes."
1,Be Warned!,"These are 50% polyester...NOT all cotton. Ultra cheap construction, drawstring is not continuous, and broke in one day of use."
3,ok for the price,"these sweatpants are made from a very thin material, kinda like pj's... they look cheap & feel cheap... but for the price they're ok for gym workouts or just loafing around the house...."
2,Perfect for giants,"I bought these sweatpants intending to use them as sleepwear and occasionally to hit the gym. I am an average white guy - 5'11"", 195lbs - and bought my usual size. The good news is that the waistband fits and they are comfortable, the bad news is the pant leg is easily long enough for someone 6'8"" or larger. They drape over any shoes I wear and cause me to slip on my tile floors when I'm getting ready for bed. Not at all what I was hoping for. If you are a taller guy in need of some light sweatpants, I would definitely recommend these. Everyone else should steer clear."
3,Way too big...,"Seems like a good pair of pants, but much too big and baggy to be Medium. More like Extra Large."
1,Not what I expected,These are not the fleece sweatpants that you find in stores. They are thin and clingy and much more poly than cotton. I tried one pair and now both pairs that I bought are on their way to Goodwill.
2,not cotton only,I called the Amazon rep. I just got my pants and the Oxford color is 58% polyester and 42% cotton and the Graphite color is 50% cotton and 50% polyester.I was looking for 100% cotton track pants and were disappointed.So the description of the pants which says 100% cotton is wrong and is to be corrected.
1,The tail is wagging the dog,"For the first few minutes, you're likely to think this is pretty cute. The view of the board zooms around in 3D, the little dog wags its tail, and the characters make droll comments. But after those few minutes it will dawn on you--all this cute stuff is getting in the way of playing the game. It takes the patience of a saint to make it all the way through an entire game, and you're unlikely to want to play another. Even if you disable as much of the cutsie stuff as you're allowed to, the view of the board still zooms around in a way that will make your stomach turn (and prevents you from getting any real sense of the location of the pieces). Play is excruciatingly slow, and frequently interrupted by the silly (and ineffective) attempts at trading by the computer players.It's loaded with sound and graphics but it's essentially unplayable. Buy this only if you DON'T like to play Monopoly."
4,More of a Bathroom book,"This is a book that is not intended to sit down and read from cover to cover. Instead, just open it up, browse to a team, and read what Rob Neyer has written.This is a must book for a baseball fan. If you like to sit with friends and discuss baseball teams and players then this book will give you good info."
5,Big Book of Baseball Lineups,"This book is a blast! I'm in my mid 40's, and this book brings back lots of childhood memories of listening to baseball games on the radio and collecting those oh-so-precious baseball cards. Lots of fun and interesting facts about players that I remember, and many that I had forgotten about."
1,It is a BIG DREAM STORY,It is just a dream story. The movie doesn't reflect the thruts. The real fact is opposite of the subject. During the world war Armenians killed many TURKS in the east of Turkey. Its a big shame to prepare this kind a film. I think Armenian lobby in state try to change the world people minds with their lies.
1,Armenia propoganda,"Armenian Diaspora must have spent a lot of money on the production of this movie. The whole movie is built on falsified facts that do not have any proofs behind them. Producers have used all possible means to attract attention of American public by using such things as US flag on Armenian side and gave a false sense as if Americans have been attacked by Turks ...It is funny that each year the number of Armenians that ""have been killed"" by Turks increases exponentially. According to the movie 1.5 million Armenians have been killed in 1915. However, if this is true, it is not clear who are the people who call themselves Armenians now.The only fact that movie relies on is the diary of a painter and his painting. There is no reliable source in the movie. However, I am pretty sure, in 20 years new generations will use this movie as a reliable source for their more exaggerated story - ""Armenian genocide"" that never happened."
5,"Don't let the talking cats fool you, This is great!","What a great film! I have to admit I like movies that make you think, and this one does just that. When compared to other main stream anime films which either center on nudity or violence to further the plot this one would seem incredibly slow and dull. But if you are in the mood to think I recommend to buy this film. And the price cannot be beat! Usually tapes of this caliber cost at least 24.00. Consider yourself lucky and buy this tape. And parents...don't worry about violence or anything of the like. It is great for all ages. But afterward be prepared to talk with your children. They will have questions. I can almost guarantee because I had quite a few myself."
5,Boys,My nephews love these movies and it is a great way for them to learn without realizing what they are doing :)
3,Great for the price but sizing is a bit off.,"This really is great for what you pay. The reviews I've read are true though. The top is very big(but easily tied tighter) and that's coming from a woman that has triple D 's! And the skirt is very small in the waist and has to be pulled up(which is fine with my husband). I'm 5'4"" and a size 10 and I got a med/LG. Overall I'm happy with it. it I bought it for the bedroom. It probably wouldn't be a good costume to wear out because of how the skirt has to be worn(at least on me) I'd definitely recommend it for bedroom wear though. The hair bows and tie are a great addition for the price but you have to buy the knee highs separately(Leg Avenue has them for a few dollars more) and any black shoes will go well with it."
4,Very Cute Shoe,"These are great looking shoes on the foot - very shapely, sexy and womanly and very flattering on the leg as well. I would order a 1/2 size larger than you would normally wear as the patent leather is very tight and doesn't break in as easily as other patent leather shoes I've owned.I was able to break in the rough edges by wearing them around the house with thick socks, but you'd be better off just getting a good fit 1/2 size larger than normal."
1,I wish it was better...,but this book was suffering from a formidable lack of editing. Morrisey would go on tangents with pointless details that he never came back to later in the book.
5,Good looking glass,"We own several Bodum double wall products and they all have the same pros and cons. The design looks great, especially with colored liquids. 13oz is perfect for beer and cola and the design keeps the drinks cold longer than standard cups. The ""floating liquid"" appearance has brought compliments from friends. The cups are easy to clean, needing nothing more than warm soapy water and a sponge. The cups are not as fragile as you might think, regular handling will not randomly cause them to crack. However, they are more fragile than regular cups due to the thin glass. I've accidently dropped a spatula on one and the cup shattered, so you do need to be careful when handling these cups.We have had issues with how these cups are shipped and several times when the cups arrive, we find that they were literally shattered into hundreds of shards of thin glass. Be careful when opening the package, you should probably shake it first to see if there are any broken glass inside."
3,"Good idea, and needs a little more work","I was looking for the ""ideal"" summertime beer glass.Bodum's Assam double-wall is a nice shape, easy for even small hands (my wife) to handle, and does keep the beer cooler longer.It would be better if the ""lip edge"" had been fused together THINNER, so you didn't feel like you were drinking out of a little bowl."
2,I dream of a world lined in velvet....,"Glasses were delivered Monday. They made it through the dishwasher and a first night of use. On Thursday one was accidentally ""nudged"" and it fell over in the sink. (Thankfully it was IN the sink.) Goodbye glass - hello itsy-bitsy pieces of glass along with several shards. The double wall gives an interesting look to the glass, but it also looks like something that one would assume is a clear plastic. If you live alone and absolutely no one else would handle these glasses, go for it.....but beware! It's back to acrylics for my next insulated ""glassware."""
4,HATS: Design and construction by Stella V. Remiasz,"Vey clearly written, loaded with very practical information.It is an excellent 'how-to' working manual, not a book of hat pictures. A wide variety of hat and brim styles and their construction is dealt with. Material swatches and illustrations for flat patterns are included.A worthwhile manual for milliners. Excellent value"
4,Excellent,"I bought this album mainly for my interest in the supporting cast (I'm a fan of Mehldau, Redman, Grenadier and Ballard.) I had never heard KR before and I am thoroughly impressed. Not only does he have amazing chops, but he also has a penchant for playing very quirky yet haunting melody lines, almost like Miles did on trumpet. The song selection is excellent. I think I only skip one or two of the songs, and that's more because I can't wait to get to other ones deeper in the album.Some of this album is slow and poignant, some is swinging, some is afro-sassy. But it's NEVER boring. If you like good jazz, buy this album. I can't wait to get more of his stuff.Highlights for me are: Th Cross, song #4, song #7 and the final track #10. But again, they're all quite nice.PS Ali Jackson is one bad-mutha, as well."
3,Deep but not quite deep enough,"3 1/2Rosenwinkel is a promising, relatively new jazz guitarist who began gaining momentum in the late 90's. His sixth studio release walks a fine line between truly innovative compositions and inspired post-bop jamming, eventually falling more into the latter category to just edge outside of excellence."
5,A scholarly examination of the work from some of the best minds of Yoga walking the earth today,"Poetry can mean many things, but occasionally, the intention is missed. ""The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained"" is a scholarly examination of the work from some of the best minds of Yoga walking the earth today. In the west, it's a poem of sensual delight, in the east it's a poem of a relationship with God - who has it right, if any of them? A deeply philosophical set of writing that will surely please a great many readers, ""The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam Explained"" will enlighten and educate."
5,Pre-Millennium Tension,"Future Sound Of London's last tribute to the 20th century is an apocalyptic peace of mastery. With dark, almost industrial heavy beat on some of the tracks (Herd Killing, We Have Explosive), and ice-beautiful melodies on others (Glass, Through Your Gills I Breath), this album weaves a tapestry of opposites. There is compassion (Everyone In The World Is Doing Something Without Me), and majestic (My Kingdom). You progress through the album, closer to the climax of his apocalyptic end, and just when you think it's over, and the cities are ruined, there is a last gasp of air. A distant heavy rock band is playing the continues mantra, repeatedly crying ""dead cities, dead cities"" before melting away."
3,"Good graphics, but not too challenging.","I find once you get above level 60 or so the game is virtually unplayable. But getting there was a fun, albeit short, few days. I found a few bugs in the product but nothing earthshattering and they have patches on the website already to fix the issues.I got it on sale, so I felt I did get my money's worth."
2,Poor packaging...,"I paid $39 for this with free shipping from amazon and I expected a cheap looking table as most the reviews mentioned. What I didn't expect was the piss poor packaging that allowed the finished panels to slide within the box leaving then completely scratched. If not scratched this would be a nice table.I use this as a printer table that is kind of out-of-sight, so, for the 40 bucks even a scratched table is useful and not worth returning and re assembling a new one. Plus, seeing this was a manufactures box I assume they are all packed the same."
2,You get what you pay for,"This product had the worst instructions and didn't even come with all of the pieces needed to put it together. It had two spots that were damaged with arrows pointing to them, meaning the seller knew it was damaged when they sent it to me. You definitely get what you pay for!"
4,Does the job for cheap Night Stand.,I wanted a cheap nice looking night stand and just what it is... It was easy to put together within 10-15 minutes perfect for my purpose. Granted materials are cheap (but you do get what you pay for this was what I was looking for to fill an inexpensive need)
2,Not worth the price,"The table is cheaply made, screws were missing and a couple slots needed to be hollowed out to allow the panels to fit into place. I gave the table 2 stars because it is functional. You can purchase a better made table for just a little more at your local stores."
1,Horrible,Product pieces were poorly made and did not fit together well. Finished product is wobbly. I had to purchase a screw for the door knob as the one provided did not fit. Would not purchase from company again.
3,Door pulls don't fit though...,"It would have been nice if they had checked the length of the screws for the door pulls before they shipped it. Only about 1/8"" or so of the end of the screw is poking out in the front -- too short to even start to screw the pull onto it. I have to go to the hardware store now to find longer screws. For a very inexpensive nightstand though, it'll do."
1,"Poor quality, poor description, poor return policy","The product description wasn't clear on whether feet were contained, but ""products frequently purchased with"" included the feet. I should have called but went ahead and ordered the extra feet. The panel does include feet, unfortunately neither set attached as directions show. I'm really disappointed with the poor quality of product HON is selling currently. When I called about returns, shipping at my expense would cost 50% of my refund."
4,Full coverage of VB6 Web capabilities,"This book covers, in excellent fashion, the realm of possibilities in web-enabling your VB6 skills.First, I would like to clarify that VB6 DOES NOT create web applications, but you have a lot of options to allow your application, or your applications logic, to be presented via web browsers. This book shows you API's and scripting languages that can be used with Visual Basic to accomplish tasks.Anyone looking for a specific solution to a web programming project using VB, then get a specialized book for that subject, do not assume this book will cover every detail of your needs.I really enjoyed the coverage of XML becuase it is hard to find quality information about this new language.Once again, Wrox rocks the boat with a great book."
2,Not well written.,"The book is a collection of articles. They are not very advanced or special, but they are not systematic enough to be considered as a textbook, and not comprehensive enough to be used as a reference manual. The book is simply not very well written. I am afraid that some people who gave this book 5 stars, had read only the table of content (and it looks really great!)."
1,Easily the Worst book I can remember buying,"I am not sure who this book the 'committee' wrote this for, but I can think of no one. More like a hodge-podge collection of Internet clippings somewhat related to Java & Macs, interspersed with useless code. It is sad because the Mac market needs a Java book covering getting started and the many options and tools Apple has provided the Java student & developer.I am sorry I wasted my money & was responsible for the deaths of the trees that made it!"
1,This sucks.,"this is the dumest movie since I saw Barney {with my freinds child} it's so stupid and and dumb I think it's a piece of older brother Roger says ""it's so stupid I could kill my self watching it it's a piece of ----, it's ------- dumb so kids never watch this it sucks"" I think it's dumb enough to die."
1,Worst cool...it actually heats up the room.....,"We just bought this yesterday, and it was 98 degree in san jose,ca. Our room was very small, so I thought maybe a swamp cooler will help, but NO, it made the room even hotter. ( I know it's not a AC, but a normal fan is better than this piece of ****..) I can't tell any difference between the ""cool"" mode and the ""fan"" mode. We bought it from Fry's, and they don't let us return it and they price it at $189."
2,Overpriced Fan,"This unit is certainly an overpriced awkward shaped air blower. It does blow air and circulates it from side to side, but it is only cool during the first 30 minutes after putting cold water in the tray. We have found it to be a great noise maker to mask the night sounds (traffic, loud neighbors, etc.), but but outside of that, it doesn't have a special filter like the original ad claimed, and it doesn't really change the temperature of the room all that much. It is nice around children, though, when you don't want little hands to get into a standard room fan..."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"Really is one of the best electronic albums of the 1990's.You can listen to this from start to finish as many times as you like and never tire of itAs the years go by ""Brace Yourself Jason"" becomes funkier, ""Midwinter Log"" more melodic, ""Catkin And Teasel"" more demented and the title track ""Lunatic Harness"" even funnier.A rare, warm, wickedly funny and FRIENDLY drill n bass album.Makes a perfect pair with Aphex Twin's ""Richard D James"" cd.There's also a collection of ""offcuts"" called ""Brace Yourself"" which is interesting but nowhere near as good as ""Lunatic Harness""If you're new to u-ziq start with this album."
3,Cool but spotty,"Like all Mu-ziq's stuff this albumn is an exercise in contradictions. Sometimes it really works and sometimes it just doens't. I would say this CD contains some of the best experimental electronica tracks that I have. However, it also containes a lot of filler - ""hmmm...I wonder what this button does?"" kinda go-nowhere noise."
3,"Better than some, but not great","Please don't kill me, Natasha fans, but I thought that this was the music equivalent of Saccharine. In my opinion, the only good song on the album is 'Unwritten', the title track.'Fashionable' references to the songwriting and singing process, as displayed by a number of pop artists recently, aren't as bad as usual but can sometimes make you feel that she's just singing about what shes doing.Pop songs are her strength. Her songs that are supposed to be tender and sad, such as 'I bruise easily', don't work. Why? Well, for a start, writing her songs would help.This album is actually my sisters, and I must say, it's better that the poppy trash she often listens too, but I still no likey."
4,No Problem Mon,This cd was excellent. I had never heard of Papa San before i heard his first single Breathe Again. I was immediately hooked to the song. I never thought about Reggae Gospel but it works. So far Track 1 is my favorite (probably because it has the most english)but overall i love the cd . Hopefully one day i can sing-a-long with the whole cd and not just listen and dance.
3,Wrong one!,"Obviously there were two of these I bought the wrong one, disappointed, because I took it out of the wrapping didn't think Mazon would take it back."
5,Amazing sound quality and crystal clear highs,I picked this up used for $100 from my local stereo shop. I'm pretty sure the guy who sold it to me must have been an idiot. It sounds AMAZING hooked up to my type r components and type s in the back. So much clearer and better sounding that my old amp (fosgate punch 400/4). The fosgate was louder though. The amp really peaks out at about 3/4 volume on my stereo but still crystal clear. I think with an extra 25 watts per channel it would really make high wattage speakers like type R's sound even better.
2,Not well made,I found the puzzle pieces to be of poor quality and fell apart easily when trying to disconnect from other puzzle pieces. One of the corner pieces looked like it has been crumpled. The picture is very nice but I am not happy at all with the durability of the puzzle pieces.
2,Leaves you hanging too often,"I have to say that I generally disagree with the mostly positive reviews about this book. This book was written by 8 different people, and it cleary shows. The chapters do not follow a clear progression, and techniques discussed in one chapter are ineffectively carried over to the next.The book also has a bizzare and haphazard arrangement of topics (For example: there is a chapter introducing Visual Studio.NET inexplicably placed towards the end of the book)Overall the book tries to cover too many fringe topics without spending enough time on the basics of server controls needed to form a solid foundation."
5,BioFreeze roll on,"I can't tell you how much I love LOVE this product.. this is the first time I have ever done a product review... I have Fibromalgia, extreme pain in my knees from arthritis, fluid, spurs, no cartlidge etc and I need surgery on both... with all the pain I have in my kidneys, spleen, knees, back and arms this product has helped me tremendously.. this is my 2nd order.. used the first bottle all up.. I love the roll on because it doesn't get on your hands like aspercreme or ben gay etc does.. I use to use Aspercreme which never really helped but was better than nothing.. now I will not be without Biofreeze... I recommend if you have pain in your legs, arms, back etc you at least try the 1 roll on pack for 5.00 .."
4,"""It was OK""",The product was fine. My only argument is that the shipping took a week longer than it was expected. Everything else was all right.
4,Sex and feelings in Spain,"A good movie representing the new spanish film safra, it presents the story of Lucía, a woman who is tormented by the sudden changes in her boyfriend's character. After a lot of romance and wild sex, he becomes more silent then usual and starts to treat her in a cold way. His relationship with a woman on a beach, and the child born from this haunts him. Wild sex and romance are the condiments to this good tale about keeping our feelings and problems for ourselves."
4,Foreign Film Review,Set design and location show the variety and scenic beauty of Europe. The quality of the photography is on par with today's Hollywood productions. I found it to be both entertaining and enjoyable.
3,All the pieces do not fit together,"This film is not bad at all, but also not terribly outstanding. Being someone who enjoys films that deal with inter-weaving plots and a stronger focus on themes and characters, I was surprised that I found this film less than interesting. I really love films like 'La Double Vie de Veronique', and 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', and found this film owed much to their inspiration. But in the end 'Sex and Lucia' played with its audience too much. After watching this film I felt the same way as after watching '21 Grams', and that is that I spent so much of the film trying to fit the pieces together that I did not have time to really care about them. Also the surprises about many of the characters made me distrust the film more than become intrigued by it. Each scene is well done, but in the end I ended up feeling very little for the whole. Not a lousy film, but not difficult to miss."
4,Sex and Lucia,"In an attempt to get over losing her novelist boyfriend (Tristan Ulloa), Luc?a (Paz Vega) retreats to a quiet Mediterranean island. It's there, in the sun-soaked refuge, that the erstwhile waitress begins to examine both the passionate beginning and the darker details of their relationship. Fact blends with fiction and time bends in unexpected ways as her memories unfold."
1,interesting life -- but formulaic boring writing,"No doubt Ms. Lu has an interesting story to tell. I commend her for her accomplishments, for her mid-life career change, and for her willingness to help others. I didn't even really mind her insights into life which another reviewer labeled narcissistic. The reason I couldn't read more than 50 pages is that the writing style is overly formulaic and there is only a miniscule amount of character development. Ms. Lu writes that this happened and I learned x,y,z, then this happened and I learned a,b,c over and over again. She was telling me her story when I wanted to be pulled into her life."
1,Maybe I got a bad one,"Maybe I got a bad one, but mine didnt work properly. had to send it back. Very poor preformance from Altec, their products are usually much better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a profrssional internet programmer, I've used PHP to design websites for 4 years. However after reading this book, I found that there is nothing new I can learn from this book, you better to save your money for other unpublished PHP books."
2,You're better off using the online documentation.,"This book has many issues. Such as poor organization and indexing, missing php functions, and lack of in-depth examples with good explanations.If your new to programming and desperately need a reference to get you started, this may be the book for you. Yet the problems I mentioned above would be frustrating for new programmers. Its frustrating enough when you know what your looking for and can't find it. I find myself using the online documentation far more than I use this book.On the other hand, this book does provide various examples on how to use php and may prove to be helpful to some.Please note that this review does not cover chapter 2 ""Installing and Configuring PHP"" since I did not need to read this portion of the book."
5,Probably the best computer book I've ever bought,"I came from non-programming background. The most advance I can get before buying this book is just ms-office and basic HTML. However, after spending a few days with it, I am quite sure that even a guy from accounting background like me can do server-side scripting. The book gives me clear explaination, and no guess work along the way. I love the XML part the most as it makes a new technology, XML, interesting enough to continue my curiousity. Right now, I am working on Professional XML from wrox."
4,IS the BOOK,"I'have the book. A lot of more books from Wrox are in my hands. This is a very good on PHP. Examples, bits of code explained step by step, huge amount of info, lack of some other (in programming NONE was perfect and complete). Good point to start serious programming with DB (MySQL or other ones). 4 stars only because God is not a programming writer, not Schumann and the others in this are, and I cannot put a 4 and half stars....If you dont know HTML, learn first. Then, read this book. I repeat, READ IT! Like a novel, not as reference one. Every page contains valuable information, only have your eyes wide open to catch it! Put it beside your bed or your WC!Results: a large Internet project, an ecommerce site, a tutorials online site, a.... well, you know what I mean. With this book, I'm mastering PHP with no fears!BUY IT NOW!"
4,Such a great language - so little documentation,"Like the other reviewers I recommend that you know a mainstream programming language before taking on PHP, this is not a cold start language. This is a very helpful book that addresses a lot of issues that come up when programming in PHP and it provides examples where the manual leaves you hanging. The section on security is very helpfull as well. This book does lend itself to being more of a reference than an instruction manual but documentation on PHP is hard to come by so in my opinion anything right now is a help. I would hope this will change but untill then I recommend this as a companion. The experienced PHP progammer may scoff at it but it has pulled me out of several snags that I have run into."
5,Comprehensive,I was looking for a PHP book that could develop a thread between unconnected and extremely vast bits of information from the manual. This book has helped me update my PHP skills apart from helping me visualize practical applications. Should be on every serious PHP developer's book shelf.
5,Vast amount of information,"I found that this book contains a vast amount of information on virtually everything you will need to know to really get up to speed with ASP.NET. I wasn't sure whether to go for this big Wrox book after reading some negative reviews about the old edition, but I've been as impressed by this title as much as I was by Wrox's former Professional ASP.Make no mistake, this is not a book for beginners. This reflects the complexity of ASP.NET. But as a comprehensive and high level study of ASP.NET, it would be hard to beat. If you're looking for a book that starts with the basics, and gradually builds up your knowledge, this book mightn't be for you. It tackles all the important topics of ASP.NET, and so assumes that the reader can keep up a fast pace.Unlike the earlier reviewer, I didn't find any bugs in the code download. In fact, I found the code to be very well organised, and free of errors."
2,Better to use Free Online Resources,This is an incredibly chunky book that somehow never gets to the important points. WROX assembled a number of authors for this publication and unfortunately this has resulted in a lack of flow/consistency.Most of the important topics are covered by the book - but they covered in a manner where it can be incredibly hard to get something useful.I bought this book looking for a good reference by my side - instead I find the online help sites and forums much more productive.I hope you find this review helpful - please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
5,A must have book!,"This book is simply the best among other books that I have reviewed and purchased. Other books cover just a small area of .NET, but this book covers the most.Eventhough written by many authors, there is hardly any duplicate content or inconsistencies in writing style."
3,Very good ASP.NET book,This is an excellent ASP.NET book with a lot of very useful content. I think this book should be suggested reading for all ASP.NET developers.So why only 3 stars?The format of the book is horrible. This is a 1400-page softcover. It is IMPOSSIBLE to read comfortably except maybe in zero gravity. It is criminal that high-tech publishers routinely charge for a shapeless lump of paper. Make it hardcover - make the page size bigger - break it into 3 tomes. These solutions have been around for ages. How did Wrox not hear about them?
2,"Very Disorganised , Repetitive","I am not at all satisfied with this book ..I usually do not write reviews ..But just wanted to caution you allI brought the book for my Certification Study ...and as a reference .But the way the book is written , you are confused .and The way it is organised , you are lost!!Like If i need some perticular thing,sometimes i am clueless as to which topic I should look .I would suggest the MCSD/MCAD book by Amit Kalani .Before you buy the book see the differnce the way these books are wrtiiten in the preview pagesand If you are plaaning to buy a book for certification , like me .. wrox is not for you .I really regret spending my money on wrox ."
2,Professional HUH?,"Usually the Professional series explains the more advanced topics, NOT THIS BOOK! It is a lot of fluff about how great .NET will be but it doesn't explain how to use it. It typically says here's a control, gee that's great, then leaves you hanging for any kind of information which isn't available. Samples are too simple and not enough of them. This book should be called ""An Overview of ASP.NET"". If that's what you need then I guess this book is for you. We are looking for an advanced book on ASP.NET, does anyone know of a good advanced book?"
1,Not Really happy for Spending $,"This books goes back and forth between VB.net and C#.netand Refer to Old ASP. (I never used old ASP)Basically, I paid money thinking that I am getting a book on ASP.net with VB.net.Rally feel like I wasted the money, as I am not happy with my purchase.This book may be good for people who know both VB.net and C#.netOtherwise don't waste your money."
2,Dont smell like baby,"im very addicted to baby smell. so i bought alot of perfume that indicated they're baby perfume. but this one, for me, the smell is too strong. not the smelling thats good for baby. and it doesnt smell like baby at all!!!!!!!"
4,good stuff,"i am happy to listen my old school electro music of 90' years and big name are on this albumdaft punk chemical brother, underworld and futur sound of lodon"
3,Good but can't get over the narrator,"I am a beginning adult ballet student and bought this to supplement my classwork. It is clearly very well made and has very good tips for ballet posture and form and is a good ballet-inspired work-out. The visuals of the dancers are inspiring and I enjoyed seeing them. HOWEVER I will probably never do this work-out again because I find the narrator's voice kind of creepy. In other work-out videos I have done I find that the energy, personality and fun of the person leading the workout is what keeps me coming back and in this case the dancers themselves do not speak, you just hear the voice of an off-screen narrator who sounds .... creepy. I don't know how else to describe it. Again, there are a lot of high-quality elements so Its worth checking out -- others may not feel the same way as I about the narration."
1,Buy This Bag Somewhere Else,"With so many ""free shipping,"" even ""free shipping and free returns"" offers out there, don't make the same mistake I did by buying from Luggage Warehouse. Not only does the Luggage Warehouse make the customer pay shipping both ways; they even charge an additional $5 if you're unhappy with the product and want to return it. (To be fair, their $5 restocking fee policy is in the fine print, but I missed it. The ""customer service""--ha--representative just told me I should feel bad for them, not the other way around, because they have to pay fees to sell their merchandise on Amazon and now, thanks to me, they're going to lose money on this purchase.)"
4,Gang Of Four - 'A 100 Flowers Bloom' (Rhino),"I can always fully support these 'best of ' collections,specially sometimes EVEN if they are of a band that I'm not all that familiar with.Because it serves as a great introduction to the artist.2-CD box set with forty songs to cover Gang Of Four's heyday from 1980-84.After which they had disbanded.To best describe GOF is incredible hard pop with an edge to it.With forty tunes intact,it might be tough to list the best.But here it goes,I took notice of ""I Parade Myself"",the somewhat eerie ""Paralysed"",""Natural's Not In It"",the powerful ""Anthrax""(probably one of the best of the entire set),a great live 1981 cut of ""What We All Want"" and ""Everybody Wants To Come"".I also liked ""At Home He's A Tourist"",""Why Theory"" and the well written ""Armalite Rifle""(a great sounding demo).Comes with a nicely assembled 50 page booklet that tells GOF's life story and includes many cool photos and rare memorabilia."
4,Useful if you want to play video poker.,"I purchased this book because I saw a TV show that said ""Video poker can be beat"". I found this hard to believe but it is apparently true on some machines with perfect play. Ah, there is the rub. Along with the book I bought a computer program that teaches you how to play and shows you each error you make. It isn't real hard to learn how to play perfectly but requires a person that can really keep focused for hours on end. Most folks with the intellect to learn this could make much more money doing something (anything ?) else but if you have to gamble this is your best shot. This book with Frugal Gambler and some real effort will make your Vegas trips more fun. I don't think Vegas casinos enjoy losing so I wonder how long this will last ?"
4,"Power, Moving Film","I found this film to be highly disturbing, but not overly surprising. Being raised Roman Catholic myself, I've heard all of the horror stories that have happened in the past. I couldn't imagine being one of those young girls and having your own family disown you because you got pregnant, even if it wasn't your fault.The film follows four women who have been disowned by their families and sent to the Madgalene sisterhoood asylum to correct their more or less sinful behaviour. Crispina and Rose have given birth to a pre-marriage child, Margaret got raped by her cousin and the orphan Bernadette had been repeatedly caught flirting with the boys. All have to work in a laundry under the strict supervision of the nuns, who break their wills through sadistic punishments. It's a very powerful movie that I think should be seen by all."
1,Can not view it on any of my players (region problem),"I just wish whoever sells these DVD's to people at a different part of the country could make it possible for us to be able to view them on our players. I have to admit I'm not too good with electronics, BUT I have 10's of DVD's store bought at my area that I have no problem watching them. So the Magdalene Sisters and The Name of the Rose were a waste of money for me. Will NOT do that again!"
4,love it,Love it...gets alot of compliments...4 stars bcaz either ran small or no other sizes larger than x-large existed...wish it would had come above that size.
4,LOVE CAN MAKE YOU PUT ON A WHOLE LOTTA WEIGHT,"A great photo-filled cookbook...few original recipes, but some tasty bits of Naomi's Southern Wisdom. I'm guessing that if there weren't so many photos of Wynonna Judd in the book, the publishers might have taken a ""pass"" on it. Maybe this is the precursor to ""LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE PART II; AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE""."
4,A good experiment,"Considered another experimental Neil Young album by many, I like to think this is a return to his roots.This is a bluesy, swinging album completely unlike any other NY record. As the Amazon reviewer points out the title track is a protest against the cynical commercial exploitation of music. Remember the video for this song, which parodied Michael Jacksons hair being on fire for his Pepsi ad. Aside from getting this message across (not that it made any difference) the album looks back to a multitude of different styles, including Soul, Rhythm and Blues and even some Jazz-like Ballads, all of which he pulls off with great style.I've been listening to this album since it came out in the late 80's and rate it 2nd only to ""After the Goldrush"". Off course NY has been very productive over the years and I probably only have 5 or 6 of his albums. No doubt some of these are just as good."
4,Complete vinyl viciousness,"There's no doubt about it. These guys are the best of the best. If you can appreciate the technical genius that is required of this kind of hard core cutting and scratching, this CD will not disappoint. Some of this stuff is just incredible. If you want hip-hop DJs, this is not it, check out Cut Chemist or DJ Honda's HII and H2000."
5,Love it,I am almost done buying most of my albums into cds. This is a great cd Quick service. Will do buis. again
4,It's Good,"it's loud like some review said it was, but it does it's job and fast. It's really good for people with thick hair."
3,No one to root for!,"This was an occasionally funny book. Sadly, there was no one in the book I particularly liked, including the lead character, Rick Domino, himself. He was snobbish and intolerant, if periodically amusing. His sidekick, the cop, was so dense as to strain credulity. None of the suspects were pleasant; I wanted them all to be guilty. A weird book."
5,Clean and effective,"This Taurine powder is fine and tastes good too. Now, I don't mean to say one should go mixing it with something. Personally, I just lick a 1/4-teaspoon by itself (in powder) since it's quite bearable - almost like a cool, semi-sweet flavour. There are occasional clumps in it, but not much graininess.As for the effectiveness, it seems to add a small boost to my energy and strength. As with most things of this sort, the more you have it, the less of a difference it makes - due to tolerance - but I think it still helps even after having been using it for some time."
5,Patricia Johnston shares her personal journey,"In Pie In The Sky: A Memoir About Writing And Publishing, Patricia Johnston shares her personal journey as a writer and self-publisher. Along the way Patricia also shares her views regarding the 1993 murder of her daughter, Jane Ellen Neuman, the subject of a CBS ""48 Hours"" television program and Patricia's ultimately successful crusade to bring her daughter's killer to justice. As a publisher, Patricia's Afton Historical Society Press has produced 37 titles (many of them award winners) and has pursued partnerships to produce and sponsor television documentaries and art exhibitions. Pie In The Sky will prove of intense interest to anyone who aspires to have their writings published, to become a small press publisher, or who has an interest in the small press phenomena and trends in today's highly competitive and rapidly evolving publishing community."
4,Just right,"-It is only slightly larger than the stock grip so just as concealable. Good palm swell and a little extra pinky space... the reason I bought it. Feels Good in the hand non clothing material snagging rubber compound material. Factory grip was too small, Hogue was to long/sticky, this Pachmayr is my Goldilocks grip... just right. Wish this had some lefty features. It would be nice to have a good thumb spot.-EDIT: After shooting with it I noticed it does eat up a lot of the recoil from the .357 Magnum loads and I do not have to readjust when shooting one handed at all. Also ejection of the spent cartridges is a little sticky on the inside 2 chambers. I will try it on a .327 6-shot next to see if it has a similar sticky effect effect."
2,Bottle rocket without a bang,"While the writing and suspense of this book are superb, the story ultimately comes to a lackluster ending. Unless mystery/suspense novels without conclusions appeal to you, I would not recommend this book."
3,why not horror?,again AB creates the greatest setting. a house where strange things happen. giving strange impressions. great descriptions. great descriptions of feelings. but in the end it turns out not to be horror at all. good plot. awful ending. AB seem never to have realized that a horror story should have a horror ending
5,I love Wishbone,Wishbone is the show that got me interested in literature. I am hoping it works for my kids as well. What's the story Wishbone?
5,Wonderful,"I bought this for my mother to get her recipes in order. It is an amazing piece of software!!! The searches, the ingredient list, the nutrition info, ingredient linking...all just very nice. Now, if only they could make it recognize voice so I could be done typing in recipes!!!A++++"
2,how did you get it to work with XP?,"I agree, it's a great software, but after having updated to XP I have been unable to load the software. If you were successful, could you please let me know if there are any tricks? Sierra told me it was not compatiable with XP and there were no plans to update."
4,"Best available BizTalk book, but still unsatisfying","The authors do the best they can working from Microsoft's grossly inadequate product documentation. BizTalk is a complicated product, and yet Microsoft has made very little information available about how it actually works. This book reflects that: the authors seem well-versed on accomplishing specific programming tasks, but they impart very little knowledge of BizTalk internals or architecture.The examples are good and the coverage of the material is comprehensive. However, the text is rather long-winded, and at times material could be expressed much more succinctly. Also, I would have liked to have seen more ""how-to"" examples as opposed to long-running sample applications that span multiple chapters.As usual, though, Wrox outclasses the other technical publishers with the best book yet on BizTalk."
1,Very frustrating book to read,"I started witht his book witha lot of interest. But reading this was really a frustrating thing. It certainly failed in putting pieces together. There is more unnecessary talk in this book than useful content. If you are serious about learning BizTalk, This is not the book for you. Go somewhere else."
3,A touch too descriptive,"The book gives a good introduction to BizTalk and the technology involved. But it is a bit too descriptive and not suited for people like me who would want to get our hands dirty by coding. The book also does not deal much with C# and how to use C# to customize the mapper, etc."
3,"Too wordy, waste my time...","This book is quite complete, but the authors have the tendency to complicate things. You have to read through pages to understand a simple theory and many explanations are repeated thoughtout the book. The authors wrote this book like a novel and it has added confusion in many areas."
5,What a terriffic guide. Very helpful!!,"This guide was not difficult to understand like some other books that I have purchased on Visual Basic 6. The book was also very thorough, and left nothing uncovered. I recommend it!!!!"
5,Covers the most important and the latest thing .....,"I only review the contents of this book, but when I see it covers deeply only the latest / important things like ADO, Three tiered system, OLAP, I know it will be the five stars. None of the books before has the braveness only to cover ADO, then expands it to advanced technologies..."
4,"""Sixty-nine never to be forgotten sound effects""","If you are a Star Trek fan or love sound effects - this CD is for YOU! It is quite interesting after all these years since 1966, when this series made its debut on the small screens in America, the sounds you hear on this album are unforgettable. You know in an instant what particular sound, whether it be action, adventure or drama the sound effect department is creating for the viewer.The final result is a unique library of brilliantly futuristic sound effects that were created by some of the best sound editors of that time. On this album are sixty-nine never to be forgotten sounds that made this series entertaining and somewhat believable, which we now find is not at all that impossible. This is not a relaxing listening CD, but the way we remember those sounds from the ""Enterprise"" during the '60s when the cast and crew were flying high and protecting this vast galaxy of ours.Total Time: 40:23 on 69 Tracks/ GNP-Crescendo - GNPD 8010 (1988)"
3,"Presents a lot of information, but often vaguely","This books provides a lot of helpful information, but at the same time, it doesn't provide it clearly enough. Part of this is because they obviously want their book to sell in several states, so they're often times vague about procedures and models, but they also give what are obviously terms you need to know in bold, and then don't bother to define them in-text, and there is no glossary."
5,Excellent software-silly format,I recently purchased this product as I have used the Greeting Card Studio Deluxe from Hallmark. This program has so many excellent cards and lots of room for custom changes. The only feature of software that really needs work is the cutesy graphics that control the program commands. The program is easy to use even for someone new to computing and the resulting cards and projects have been really professional-looking. So nice if you like to remember special people with equally special sentiments.
2,Not my favorite,"Of the Sunfire books I've read so far, this was definitely my least favorite. Perhaps my lack of interest in the Alamo had something to do with it, but mostly I found the story very predictable and Cade Riley just wasn't a consistent character. Sometimes he was very romantic, and other times, particularly when the subject of war came up, it seemed more like ""Vicky who?"" I also never understood how the relationship of Billy and Naddy progressed as it did...it just kind of happened. This wasn't a bad book, just not a great one."
2,A disappointment for my son,"My son, who is now three years old, loves the Wiggles. He was so excited when I brought home this DVD and he begged me to put it in the player. After about four songs he wasn't interested in it anymore and asked me to stop playing it.Other reviewers are right when they say it's a rehash of old songs. My son still loves Dance Party, which is basically the same songs on the Big Red Car but it was recorded in their earlier days as the Wiggles.Either the Wiggles are running out of new songs, or they should have renamed this one ""The Wiggles, their greatest hits""."
2,Where's Waldo? Where's the book?,"The book is a tiny version, which wasn't explicitly stated in the description. Otherwise, it is nice, new. No wonder it was so inexpensive, cuz, it is tiny."
4,a good gift for parents suffering the loss of a child,"I bought this for one of my counseling clients who found her son dead. It is a good guide for the emotional ups and downs that come along with the death of a child. Unfortunately, there is really nothing anyone can do to take away the pain of a loss like this. This book does tell the parents that they're not alone in their struggles. As a MH Counselor I do have to say that if you expect your friend/family member to read this right away, you can forget that! The brain goes into shutdown for a long time. My client, now 6 months post-loss, is just beginning to read the book - she says that it's written so that she can read a little and put it down and still get some value from the insights."
4,Can I live with the McGowan Boys?,"I picked up this book cause I was curious how Megan Meade was going to cope with living with 7, yes 7 BOYS. And let's just say I was not disappointed AT ALL. Good read this book everybody. NOW! And love it. Love Finn McGowan. He's amazing.The end."
4,you have to love that laugh thing the lead singer does,"ok, the music store must have been playing a joke on me. i listened to ""THE BRIDGE"" at my local music store, and every song the lead singer did his weird laugh, the put that part on the sample.i thought that was kinda annoying. but i bought the album anyway and discovered he only did it about 5 times. but now, its cool. any way, when i first heard this cd, i thought it was kinda bland. then i listened to it a few more times, and i realized this was a cool, emo band that had cool guitar solos. you dont hear that everyday do you?"
4,quite refreshing actually,"now letter kills struck me as one of those emoriffic bands,especially after looking at the back cover.it was on sale one day,had the gift card,and i had heard SO MUCH about this band so i figured to give it a try.well what i heard surprised me.""lights out"" is fantastic.""whatever it takes"" is my absolute favorite.an amazing track.this band does have that touch of emo/pop punk, but they branch out and rock, and dont try to conform to their peers.they could easily fit in on tour with any other metal band out there,not just a tour with like underoath,taking back sunday,and coheed and cambria.very diverse and something different.im really enjoying this cd,and even if you cant fathom the thought of buying a cd from an emotype band,i strongly urge you to go against yourself and buy this album."
1,The worst. 3 of these DVD players died in less than a year.,"I should have known this was a bad product considering how cheap it was. Anyway, I had three of these break on me in less than a year. I'd like to say I have had luck with technology but thats not the case, this really is an awful dvd player."
