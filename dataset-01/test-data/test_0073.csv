1,No Andrew Davies Script here,"""He loves me. He loves me. He really loves me,"" is just one example of this melodrama's inferior dialogue. This may be A&E, but it's no Andrew Davies production. Regardless of the presence of some very good names in the cast, the acting is incredibly superficial. ""Catherine the Great"" is merely a spectacle to dazzle its viewers with Zeta-Jones' beauty and a series of ornate sets and costumes. There is no time or depth committed to relationships between characters or important events. Battle scenes show comical swordfighting choreography . This film is an insult to fans of historical period dramas. I'm about ready to sell this one back. Not recommended."
1,Waste of money and time,"This is the worst movie I have seen!!!! If you don't know history, you should not make historical movies!!! The only person who can watch this movie is somebody who doesn't know anything about Russia and doesn't care about actors. This movie is ridicioulos."
1,shara plain & tall trilogy vhs,did not order this.ordered 3 books and got them thats alright.did not recieve this and called and emailed you.you said contact sellers.they did not get back to after 3 emails .i paid credit card as not to efect my credit.paid for something i did not recieve and could not get answer !!!!!!!very un satisfied !RAY
2,Too slow and too much noise,"Le principal problème de cet enregistrement est qu'il juxtapose du très bruyant et de l'inaudible avec une prédilection pour le très bruyant. Les chanteurs sont souvent noyés mais ce n'est finalement pas très grave : trop occupés à sauver leur chant, ils le dénaturent souvent. La jeune Agnes Baltsa évite les gros écueils d'Eboli mais malgré la beauté de son chant, elle est bien désincarnée. Mirella Freni chante cependant un très beau ""Tu che le vanità"" et José Van Dam est un très bon moine. À ceci s'ajoute un irrespect des tempi préconisés par Verdi et donc un ralentissement exagéré : le trio des jardins de la reine fait un quart d'heure, l'air d'Élisabeth douze minutes, soit des durées supérieures de 15% à un enregistrement normal. Et puis, c'est encore une version en quatre actes, avec mme quelques coupures. Bref, une version à acheter d'occasion, pour les complétistes."
5,Fabulous recording,"This recording is in my view the best Don Carlo you can find. Main reason for that is the excellence of all the singers and Karajan's apprehension and comprehesion of the drama. Out of all the existing recordings, this is the only one, where all the performers are at their absolute top in their careers in one of their best roles. Don't hesitate to make this choice, even if it's one of the cheapest one!!!"
3,stay away from the old house,"Burke continues to brood about the death of Bill Malloy, challenging Carolyn Stoddard to ask her uncle Roger what really happened in the automobile accident ten years ago. And David Collins volunteers to Victoria Winters that his parents used to fight about Burke.But the highlight of this tape is when David takes Vickie on her first visit to the old house. There are lots of rare spooky exterior shots including the actors, then our first visit inside, and then a shimmering white figure steps out of the portrait of Josette Collins..."
3,OKOKOKOK,"Amy Adams was good, a Oscar contender I do not think so, I actually thought the whole story line was strange. Benjamin McKenzie in a change of pace role from the OC, in which he made famous, as the inept of husband of Ashley (Amy Adams). Not sure how but it did get a best drama award at Sundance. I just felt the viewer deserved more a more closer look into the lives that surround the people living in a small town of North Carolina."
1,"where's the raid? - enjoy the preview, skip the movie","you'll want it to ward off this movie.watch the preview - it's decent, but the movie is a stinker.it tried to give depth and show the human flaws of the characters, but it doesn't pull it off. the character development crossed just into the line of stereotype and cliche instead, and as a result i felt no connection or empathy to any of the characters. the acting is decent, possibly good, but there isn't any substantive plot to accompany the acting.this felt more like something a film student would bring in as a backdrop on which to overlay an actual movie and plot."
2,Simple...but what was the point?,"Coming from a small country town myself, I really don't get the point of the film. A week in the life of...? I agree that McAdams stole every scene she was in, but really there was nothing else going on-so how hard was that? Sure the director and cinemetographer captured the stillness of a country town. Bravo. But call me picky, I do like my films to have a point. A plot. A theme-something. I come away from this with more questions than answers. The main one (because there's plenty of them.) What was the deal between George and Johnny? Overall, the movie was a little too slow for my taste and I would have preferred our main characters to have some kind of character arch or growth after this experience-especially since this was aiming to be a character movie."
3,A mediocre movie about the importance of family,"I wish I could say that ""Junebug"" is worth watching just for Amy Adams' wonderful,Oscar-nominated performance as Ashley. This movie says a lot about the members of George's family (including George) in the silences between words. However, I don't feel it shows us enough about the characters' relationships or personalities. For example, there should be a little more about the relationship between George and his brother Johnny. Johnny's hatred for George doesn't completely feel justified. There should also be more insight into George b/c we don't know a whole lot about who he is. And what draws Madeline to George aside from sexual chemistry? She's a strong, independent entrepenuer. Overall, we learn that family is important. What a revelation. This movie is not very memorable or different. GRADE: C+"
1,Perverted,"I know filmmakers have lowered their standards, but Junebug was perverted and insulting. Several scenes prominently feature odd uses of sex. Early on, a husband fingers his wife while he's driving. Ab artist in the film paints pictures of giant penises and castrated men with blood pouring out. On top of that, the movie makes all southerners out to be dumb, religious hicks. I'm not a southerner and don't care much for the south, but even I thought it went too far. I only wish I could get that 1.5 hours I spent watching Junebug back."
4,Culture clash,"Interesting small film that spotlights what happens when big city meets country, sophisticated meets bumpkin etc. The married couple don't really appear to go together, but that doesn't wreck the film. Some nice touches, such as the relationship between the sister and the British art dealer wife, make this worth watching."
4,Great sequel,"I love historical fiction, great characters, suspence, some spiritual reminders and new ways of thinking of things. This was a great book like all of Phillips books and I read it all the day it arrived."
3,Not enough detail but nice to see the spirit of forgiveness,"I had hoped this video would offer the viewer more detail about the battle of the Huertgen Forest. The veterns from both side don't really go into too much detail and that is not something to fault them for, war is hell afterall. I wish the producers of this documentary would have had more history of this battle, 60,000 casualties is no small number. A six month campaign would have enough information to put into a documentary on this battle and the verterns who made it through it. It is nice to see that both German and American soldiers can come together in the spirit of brotherhood and forgiveness, that is one great thing about the video. I would not find this video very useful in its entirity for a history classroom because of the lack of detail and explaination. Clips from it could open up some great discussion."
5,great information.,"I've owned this book for several years, lost it, missed it and found it again on Amazon. This book lays out essential steps on how to attain what you need in life and eliminate what you don't. It doesn't just work, it is. It's an essential piece of work to anyone needing to change their life."
5,Wisdom and Truth,"I can not put into words how great this book is. For all those who want to dig deeper spiritually but without all the complexities. Raymond Holliwell uses simplicity that you can understand and apply to your daily life. VERY well written!! Must read! This is not just another ""law of attraction, self help"" book. It is MUCH deeper than that."
2,Save your money,"I was disappointed in this book. Nowhere does it tell how to actually do this Rapid Eye Technology. It just tells you to buy her videos or to see a ""technician."" I'm giving it two stars instead of just one because the author sounds like a genuinely good person. She describes how she fasted and prayed and asked God to give her a technique that would help people. She also includes several chapters on what she calls life skills. But overall, when I buy a book, I expect to learn something I can actually apply, not just a sales pitch."
1,Beware,"I would advise anyone not to become involved with this as I have learned the hard way that this organization is cult like and the greatest majority of its practitioners are Mormons I have attended many sessions and seminars of this cultic practice and have never met meaner more vindictive people in my life. Quite a few of the leaders have serious eating and behavioural disorders and my question is if this works why do we have leaders with obesity and very serious emotional problems. athey are much like the Mormon church who strikes back at anyone who dares question. I had to drop out of a training meeting because I was being attacked by several of the women there because I did not appear to be one of the mormon faithful. You do not have to believe me, but I can tell you many stories about this organization. BEWARE!"
5,Great 2-in-1 toy,"This item is a book and a puppet, which makes it a great deal, especially for the inexpensive price. There are too few Backyardigans merchandise out there, so I was happy to stumble across this item."
1,Terribly depressing,"I understand that the series was written to be ""historically accurate"", but really honestly does every person in the book have to succumb to some horrible debilitating accident, disease, or death???? Although this may have been true to life for that era of time, there is definitely nothing enjoyable about reading so much detail about so much misery. When a person is reading a fiction series, at least I for one want it to be an enjoyable read, even if the subject matter is serious. It could have been written as historically accurate without continual devastating events one on top of the other. I also started losing track of the characters, there were so many and they just sort of get all jumbled in the mix. I enjoyed the first and second books in the series, the third I liked less, and this fourth one I just couldn't continue...I quit about half-way through it and will not read the next."
4,another great book,Continuing the story of Norwegian immagrants. Things finally start going their way. The land is beginning to produce and more relatives come to join them.
3,A good book but some parts are hokey,"I found myself both nodding in agreement and shaking my head with confusion when I read this book. Certainly, there is lots of good advice throughout. But it is mixed with out of place new age talk, about healing water, and being one with the Earth. While I certainly appreciate and respect our planet, I don't feel the need to be indoctrinated with planet-loving spiritualism when I read an emergency preparedness book. With all that said though, this book does hit the mark in many areas."
2,prepper,intro seemed incouraging until the hundred page al gore rant on global warming. i deleted the book from my kindle without finishing it.
5,DELIGHTFUL ESCAPIST FARE,.....Carole Lombard at her wackiest. William Powell at his wittiest. What more could one want?.....This delightful comedy is set in the Great Depression so is somewhat dated but why be picky. The dialogue is superb and the laughs are frequent all tied up in a morality play with a happy ending. The dvd transfer is excellent and even the colorized version looks good. Highly recommended for classic movie buffs.
1,BLANK SPOT TOWARD END,"THE ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THE BLANK AREA ON THE MOVIE TOWARD THE END. IT WAS REPLACED AND THE SECOND ONE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. I DECIDED TO KEEP THE SECOND COPY AND LIVE WITH IT.OTHERWISE, I WAS SATISFIED...HOPEFULLY THIS MOVIE WILL BE CHECKED AND THE PROBLEM IF ONE EXISTS WILL BE CORRECTED."
3,"Good Film, but Poor Transfer","This was a great Classic motion picture, but the transfer of this version of the film was of poorer quality than expected. I guess I should have held out for a remastered version. It is still better than not getting to see this movie at all."
4,One of my all time favorite movies,I just realized it's both in black & white and colorized. This is a wonderful screwball comedy with the usual happy ending. I highly recommend it.
5,Godfrey--The best way to see it!,"The clarity of the print is wonderful, the sound is clear, and the comedy as timeless as ever. Well worth the money over the other prints that I have had in the past."
1,Blue disc,"This is my second try with this movie. the first being a very cheap one, with predictably bad quality. This issue, though, is not only just as bad (low resolution, excessive contrast) but also, 3X the price. Also, it's a burned disc (sometimes called a blue disc) and will not by some reports last as long as a commercially produced CD."
2,Disappointed!,"I was excited to get a copy of this movie with the deleted scene included, which is critical to appreciating the story. I did not expect such poor picture quality, which came through as very grainy and blurred. Guess I will be shopping more carefully in the future."
3,Fast-talking silliness!,Fast-talking silliness! Fun and mindless! Some good moral of the story content. Selfish rich learn their lesson and all is well!
4,Excellent Entertainment,Powell in one of his best and Lombard is perfect as the scatterbrain socialite....fun for the whole family...
5,Perfect,This is perfect for someone new to Quickbooks. You can follow right along with the CD and the instructor is clear and precise. The chapters are easy to search and follow a logical order.
1,"Great time capsule, lousy movie","What a hoot this is! The fictional characters and the story line are pure hokum, and most of the stars, with the distinct exception of the superb Ray Bolger, are unintentionally hilarious. This might have worked in WWII, but a good movie has to endure. And the sight of American soldiers carrying dinimutive Chinese soldiers on their shoulders, or Gracie Fields singing a lighthearted novelty number about shooting down ""Jap"" planes (followed, oddly enough, by ""The Lord's Prayer""), pretty much invalidates any claim this movie has to being of any value to anyone. (Oh, and let's not forget ""Romeo and Juliet"" over the fruit counter! And Katharine Hepburn's one-for-the-Gipper speech! I could go on and on.)"
4,YES!,"THANKS A&E FOR PUTTING SPACE 1999 ON DVD!THE FIRST EPISODE GETS THE WHOLE SHOW STARTED WITH THE MOON BLASTING OFF INTO SPACE AND I LOVED THE ZOMBIE LIKE ASTRONAUTS IN THIS EPISODE TOO! SET 1 ALSO HAS CHRISTOPHER LEE AND EPISODES LIKE 'BLACK SUN' WHICH SIMULATE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ON QUALITY LSD. THINGS DRAG AT TIMES AND I WISH THE ZOMBIE LIKE ASTRONAUTS IN THE FIRST EPISODE ACTUALLY ATE THEIR VICTIMS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I'M REAL HAPPY WITH THIS SET. GREAT SHOW!"
4,Space:1999 - Why Didn't the Moon Break Away Yet?,"The long-awaited DVD release of Space:1999, for hard core fans of the 70's science fiction adventure series, is a blessing. Visually, the new DVD transfers, lifted from the original 35mm prints are nothing less than gorgeous. Colors are full with warm hues and the picture possesses a sharpness that exceeds the J2 Communications Laser Disc releases. The audio track is very clear. The photo gallery of behind-the-scenes added to each disc is a welcom extra and curiosity for any serious or casual fan. I would ask for more extras, such as commentary tracks or interviews, but I will be happy if A&E just follows through by releasing the rest of the series and with the same high quality. The Prisoner TV series release by A&E was to say the least disappointing. Space:1999 fans unite and purchase every volume!"
3,Wonderfully remastered old sci-fi classic,"Without gushing too much about how long I've waited for this I'll just say that the remastered Space:1999 episodes look fantastic, especially since the original source material is about 25 years old. I'm sure only fans are going to pick up these DVDs since the show is so old and ""obscure"" so I'll discard with episode reviews since you probably know them in your sleep. I'll just simply state that the quality of this remastering is better than I had hoped."
5,Excellent book!!!,This book is awesome. This book is theoretical but it has enough examples to follow along. The author's presentation is clear in every step. The problems in the book are challenging but do-able. Don't need another reference book.
3,Good Album,"If you like Goth-Rock-Synth music, then this CD is for you. I love Curve and Garbage, and think Collide is close, but not up to par with the previous two bands. The first half of the album is strong and is highlighted by such songs as ""Deep"" and ""Strange"", However the second half of the album is a bit weaker. A good band with a lot of potential."
2,Not what I expected,"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I am a fan of Conan, but I found Red Nails to be dark (literally and figuratively), hard to follow, and a little confusing. Not much 'swashbuckle' for a Conan work. I would definitely not recommend this one."
2,Fair speakers,"I bought these because reviewers said they sounded good. They sounded hollow to me, so I returned them."
2,Could be a good speaker but.....,"Right out of the box, one of the speaker's woofers had a rattling sound like it was defective. While this does happen on occasion, it is unreasonable that the customer should have to pay for return shipping on a defective item. This has to be changed. Return shipping for these speakers are 40% of the cost of the speakers.This will prevent me from ordering big ticket items from Amazon in the future."
2,351 Cleveland,This is a collection of old hot rod magazine articles and as such is verrry old and dated material. Most of it is available on line. A lot of the photos are poor quality Xerox copies taken from the original magazine articles.
4,Light but satisfying,"This book contains some simple ideas about the importance of relationships but it packs a rich emotional punch. The writing is easy to read and very conversational. In many parts it almost reads more like a movie script, and indeed I was struck by how closely the plot of the movie adhered to the book. Hornby's strength is dialogue and his weakness is character development. I found myself wanting to learn more about what happened in their lives before the narrow window of time this story represents."
4,How you get normal,"The novel is about a twelve-year old boy and a 36-year old man, who have both problems. They cannot act their age. By getting friends, they start to help each other. The novel is written in omniscient third-person point of view. In each chapter it is weather written from the boy's view or the man's view. The caracter's viewpoint constantly changes. This way of a plot is easy to read and increases the suspense. The caracters are well-chosen and act realistic, so that the reader could simply identify with one of them. I recommend this book, because it encourages you to think about the sense of life and how happy you are in your position. It is a well written- book."
3,How we get normal,"The novelle is about a twelve-year old boy and a 36-year old man, who have both problems. They cannot act their age. By getting friends they start to help each other. The novel is written in omniscient third-person point of view. In each chapter it is written weather from the boy's view or the man's view. The character's view constanly changes. This way of a plot is easy to read and increases the suspense. The charaters are well chosen and act realistic. The reader could simply identify with one of them. I recommend this book, because it encourage you to think about the sence of life and how happy you are in your position."
1,Clearly NOT a book worth reading,"Nick Hornby clearly can't write. You can't 'feel' the characters of this book. They seem to have a very contradictory personality, and you have the impression that Hornby himself doesn't seem to know whom he is describing. At times the hero is a bored middle age man, and the next paragraph he is a dynamic young man with an exciting personality.A shame, because the story could be interesting. A fascinating subject ruined by lack of talent."
3,Hornby's a bit less compelling in this one...,"Having read ""High Fidelity"" in about 3-4 days (a record for me), I found this book enjoyable in the end, but with nowhere near the pageturning excitement of Hornby's earlier work. I really had to force myself to get to page 100. Overall, if you're already a Hornby fan, I would recommend the book, just so that you could get a sense of his real versatility as a writer."
3,Reading with Tequila,"About a Boy is yet another book I read after seeing the movie. I don't actually remember much of the movie and I'm afraid the book may be just as forgettable. About a Boy was about a strange and thankfully innocent relationship between a bizarre twelve-year-old boy and an unambitious man-child. I just couldn't connect with the characters or the story. There was lots of whiny drama that amounted to nothing. The characters change and grow throughout the story, but in average predictable ways that you see in most ""growing up is hard"" novels. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad book. The writing was good. The story flowed smoothly and quickly. About a Boy just lacked that certain something to make it stand out from other novels of its kind."
3,About a Boy,"With his usual doses of wit and wisdom Nick Hornby once again uses a sort of good-for-nothing guy as an example of how live a good life. Will Freeman spends his days doing 30-minute increments of nothing and trying to hide the fact that he comes up as a blank every time he meets an attractive woman. As much to his surprise as anyone else's there is actually something there. Beyond his carefully sculpted persona of cool Will Freeman may actually be a human being. Remembering the days when being cool was in end in itself, I wonder if there was any substance to it..."
5,About so many boys..,"What a delightful exploration of how a thirty-something (can't remember exactly how old) boy turns into a man. This book draws the lives of the two main characters together and shows how they develop through their interaction. Nick Hornby writes in a simple yet not patronising manner, and takes the reader on an interesting, fun, enlightening journey. BUT please don't take my word for it... have a read, and a laugh :-)"
5,A wonderful summer read,"I usually go for more serious fiction, but the reviews on this looked good, so I bought the book... And what fun! I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading this! I was absolutely charmed by the main character, Will (and loved how he couldn't identify with being called Bill); how absolutely real and honest the author kept him; his character stayed true throughout the book, which I find most refreshing. Actually, all of the characters were written with a thoughtful eye; they honestly expressed the frailty of the human condition and didn't completely reform or become heroes by the end - they just became a little wiser, a little more aware, and certainly happier.I found the author to be a modern male version of Anne Tyler in the way he depicted ordinary people falling into peculiar circumstances and then what happens in their life as a result..Bravo, Nick! Keep it up...- A New Fan"
3,Let's Pray the Movie is Better Than the Book!,"For about the first 200 pages, I felt like I was in the company of true genius. Mr. Hornby is that rare creative talent who keeps the reader turning pages and wanting to know more. But the last third of this novel -- to borrow a phrase from Nirvana -- is ""Neverending."" Will's initial deception to Rachel (who just magically appears without warning)about the true nature of his relationship to Marcus is totally implausible and the narrative shifts away from the relationship between Marcus and Will to Marcus and Ellie and the death of Kurt Cobain. It just goes on and on and on. Great writing, bad plotting. Historically, the book is always better than the movie. Let's pray it's not the case this time."
4,"About a boy, or about a man?","A very well written book projecting the evolving relationship between a boyish man and a manish boy in modern England and the way they help each other realize their own selves.Will, leading a (what many men would think) perfect life, not having to work but still being able to enjoy it, with his fancy car and yappie ways encounters a boy way beyond his (and his own) years.They both find new things about life and about themselves and they build this amazing and unbelievable at first friendship.A light, pleasant read, recommendable to spend the warm/hot days of the summer with...."
4,Good... but the movie is better?,"I'm going out on a limb here, and actually proclaiming a movie is better than a book. If you've seen the movie, you might be disappointed by the book a bit. The funniest parts are all intact in the movie, so you're not really missing much by not reading this. The endings are very very different, but I think that the movie's ending comes to a much more natural conclusion. If you haven't seen the movie, definitely read this first...it's a great read, and then proceed to the theater or rental shop and be floored by how good the movie adaption is."
3,"Good, but not quite up to ""High Fidelity""","Nick Hornby's a great writer and I really enjoyed ""About A Boy"", but not as much as his first novel, ""High Fidelity"" (and to some extent, ""Fever Pitch"").I may be holding his latest book to a higher standard because ""High Fidelity"" spoke so loudly to me. In many ways ""High Fidelity"" chronicled my own life; connecting with my own passions for music, books, and women. And while I did enjoy ""About A Boy"" on the merits of the story alone, I didn't relate as well to Will as I did with Rob in ""High Fidelity"" or Nick, himself, in ""Fever Pitch.""At any rate, he's one of my favorites and you'll find me first in line at the bookseller's when his next book arrives."
4,The Bill Evans of the jazz harp...,"Quick: Name a jazz harp player... any jazz harp player.Stumped? Perhaps you came up with Alice Coltrane. If you're really hip, you might even know about Dorothy Ashby.Now you can add Carol Robbins (who actually studied with Ashby) to this very short list. It's tempting to call her the ""Bill Evans of the jazz harp"" -- and so I just did. And this is a good thing.Joined in various combinations by guitarist Larry Koonse, reedman Bob Sheppard, drummer Tim Pleasant, Derek Oles on bass, and Steve Huffsteter on trumpet and flugelhorn, Ms. Robbins has crafted a charming and enjoyable ""ballads and bossas"" outing here, with a more-or-less equal balance of standards and original tunes.Jazz Play is elegant, classy, and seductive ""dinner jazz"" mood music that also rewards dedicated listening. If you're not already hip to the rare and unlikely beauty of the jazz harp, Carol Robbins will make you a believer."
4,Hilarious zombie film,"The King of Zombies - This movie is really funny. I don't know if it was intended to be funny, but the movie is hilarious. Mantan Moreland, the man playing the African American valet or male servant, is so funny. The movie is a great laugh and I highly reccommend it. Gotta love the quotes in this movie! In one scene Moreland, thinking he is a zombie, tells the other zombies ""Move over boys, I'm one of the gang now"". He then proceeds to lead the ""Zombie Squad"" to the kitchen. Good and funny."
2,Mantan Moreland Steals the Show,"Third-billed Mantan Moreland is the real star of this 1941 Monogram horror-comedy. Whenever the hilarious character actor appears on screen, ""King of the Zombies"" rises above the usual low-budget schlock. Unfortunately, the non-Moreland scenes are deadly dull. Henry Victor gives a serviceable performance as the mad scientist (a role intended for Bela Lugosi). Amazingly, Edward J. Kay's traditional B-movie score received an Oscar nomination."
3,Bad production,"I thought the content was fascinating. However, all that loud noise at the beginning of each DVD produced by the company is irritating and unnecessary. It was ""home movie"" quality and I had difficulty hearing what was said. I recommend this just for the content. Maybe reading the book would be a better choice though."
3,Abducted By Aliens-A Young Psychic's Story,"This DVD is a follow-up to the book of the same title, written by Ann Andrews about her ""indigo"" son. She asserts that he is a powerful psychic who has been abducted multiple times by aliens. The DVD provides a live interview with the players in this extraordinary story."
5,Best Paper Yet!,"Really impressed with this paper. Much better than HP premium paper and an excellent price, too!. Images dry quickly and are sharp and clear,"
5,"Cute, Simple and to the Point","We keep this book in the bathroom for our almost 2 year old to occupy his time while toilet training. I especially appreciate that this book demonstrates baby Kermit using the big toilet with a removable potty seat rather than a toddler's potty chair, which seems to be the approach in other ""potty"" books."
1,Slow moving and difficult to read.,"This book was an assignment for an AP English course and if it hadn't been I would have put it down after the first three pages. It was hard to follow from the begginning because it gave descriptions about things you couldn't understand. Confused and irritated, I forced myself to finish the novel and found the entire thing to be boring and lame."
1,What a stupid book,"I didn't get this book, but I tried to keep reading. I am an avid reader, but I finally had to quit wasting my time. I couldn't identify with any of the characters (thank God). I can't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Great Potential,"The plot of the story had a great potential. It portrays four people coming from different walks of life and experiences during WW11. Each character has an intriguing and sad story that has altered his or hers life for ever. Unfortunately, the author spends so much time proving to his readers his proficiency in the English language that the book looses its charm after few chapters. The most influential writers and philosophers (of present and past) make their writing unforgettable not by using the longest and at times inappropriate words but by eloquently putting them together."
4,The English Patient,"Ondaatje is a true craftsman of characters. Read this if you think you could be ""in love with ghosts."" What other author has the ability to craft robust introspective phrases out of solitary and hollow words? Can you ever remember ""awaking from sleep with a heaviness caused by unremembered dreams"" as Hannah does?"
1,"Dull, contrived and pretentious","Without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. If you are looking for an ending, don't waste your time. Here's the story in a nut-shell: Nothing happens"
2,"the movie was better, and different","so I saw the movie when it came out, and really liked it. I always meant to read the book and finally found a copy. I made several attempts to get started and found it confusing and impenetrable. finally, I decided to plow through to the end believing it must be good since the movie was, and the book was a best-seller.I must say that there isn't much to the book. nothing happens; no real plot develops. it just ends, with a little end-note about Kip the sapper after the war which was both jarring and unnecessary.the most unsatisfying loose-end is the fate of the patient Almasy. the book ended with him in bed just like it started, and never having been forthcoming with Hana, Carvaggio, or Kip.also, once in the book it says the Bedouins treated Almasy with tannic acid which turned his skin dark. that is truly bizarre. this is how you tan animal hides to make leather. it kills the cells and makes them non-porous. is there a dermatologist in the house to comment?"
2,"Despite flowing and intriguing language, storyline was flat.","It started out as if it was going to be pretty interesting, with the fantastic description of the setting. That's okay for an intro, but the main thing is, THE ENTIRE BOOK SHOULD NOT BE AN INTRO. We wanted to see Odaantje step off the setting for a few moments and start concentrating on other things... like plot, maybe. Don't get us wrong, Odaantje had a brilliant writing style. But it just didn't work for a novel. Maybe he should stick to poetry."
2,Too ethereal and too dense,"While I count the movie as one of my favourites, I found the book The English Patient to be incoherent, too loosely drawn with some of the densest prose this side of Heart Of Darkness! Gossamer images clog the narrative leaving the reader with an impression of holding a cobweb - one is left reading nothing but air! Like A Room With A View, the movie is better than the book, and the soundtrack is worth buying as well."
5,I loved it.,"This book was given to me on an airplane and I read it because I had nothing else to read. I had seen the movie and thought it was OK. The book however, I absolutly loved. The movie focused primarily on the English Patient, but the book was different in that you got to know each character quite intimately. They all were in the house for different reasons and each of them had very unique and intrieging backgrounds. I was sucked in immediately. Each charachter is developed and you are able to understand who they are and why. All of their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and they are quite vulnerable. If you are someone who likes to bond with a characters and watch them develop, this book is for you."
2,Mildly dissappointing,"I think a better title for the book should have been ""Kip-the wary sapper."" Ondaatje only devotes, at most, three chapters to the English Patient. The rest of the book is devoted to Kip, the bomb sapper. I honestly thought that the book would be about the title, but I was wrong. Although the book was written well, I was disappointed in it. I wanted to know more about the English Patient and his journey's through the desert. I would only recommed this book to others after informing them that it is about mainly about Kip."
5,Enchanting,"The English Patient is like a present under the Christmas tree. It is beautiful at the start, and fills you with anticipation, awaiting what is to come. It is a many layered story. Hana, the nurse and the nameless English Patient inhabit a villa north of Florence, Italy near the end of World War 2. Soon, two new characters, Caravaggio a thief and Kip, a sapper are introduced to the plotline. As they all live their lives at the villa, Ondaatje feeds us snippets of their pasts and how they came to the villa. The novel is well-written, and easy to get into. It is an experience I won't soon forget."
3,not the best sound,they sound pretty decent; and if price is an issue then they're a good choice. there is much room for the improvement of sound quality but at the price i purchased them for ($90/pair) i'm satisfied enough. i plan on upgrading.
3,Average follow-up to stellar first book,"The second book has three main problems: 1) The cover art is not nearly as original and creative as the art in the first book.2) The jazz albums are not as prominent or important as the albums in the first book; therefore, this book is not as historically important as the first.3) The books are two different sizes; they should line up side-by-side on the bookshelf or look like they were designed as a 2-volume set on your coffee table.Buy the first book, but I recommend you just check this one out from the library."
2,Doesn't Work,"I have used this product now for a few months. I wash my dog around ever three weeks because she can't stop itching, scratching, biting or licking. I also buy dog food without grain to help with this as well. I spare no expense for my dog but still haven't found relief for her. I will need to further investigate if there is another shampoo to help relieve the itch."
1,NOT GOOD FOR CATS,"I thought that this shampoo would work for my cats' chronic ringworm, instead it caused her to ich till she bled. I would stay away from this shampoo if you want to use it on a cat."
4,Cute and entertaining!,"My daughter loves this - as she barely watches the Backyardigans on TV, but she loves to hear Tyrone sing his song over and over. Be careful of the hard hat (I don't think it's removable). The rest of him is soft and can be held by younger children."
3,Spinning Waterfall,It's a Ok toy. Balls don't fall as freely as I though they would but after some shaking and tilting it works.
2,Freni and Carreras overparted in big roles,"""Ada"" requires a spinto soprano and a spinto tenor. Mirella Freni and José Carreras are not such singers. They are both overparted. Only Baltsa and Cappuccilli hold up their end respectably. Freni's lyric voice is pushed in ""Ritorna vincitor"" and sadly cannot ride the Triumphal Scene ensemble. Without the help of the mikes, she would have been drowned out. Carreras does not have the heroic tone for Radamès. He also cannot ride the Triumphal Scene ensemble. His sequence of G's at the end of Act Three are nothing compared to the ones Corelli hits in his studio recording of ""Ada"" with Birgit Nilsson.Skip this recording. Verdi did not write for lyric voices such as Freni and Carreras. Ada and Radamès deserve better. The reviewers of this recording who praise it to the skies are obviously fans of Freni and/or Carreras. They really don't care how well Freni and Carreras serve their roles, only that they merely sing them. What a shame!"
1,Sony support nonexistant,"If sony could get a zero, I would give them a zero. Sony has no concept of giving their customers any after purchase support. The battery on this clie has never held a decent charge. Due to my work, I am not able to leave it plugged in all day; so I tried to find a car charger. No one had one not even sony and their support never emailed me back. I decided to replace the battery and once again no one had a replacement, and sony was non responsive. I guess by halting support of their clies sony believes that everyone will have to buy a psp. NOT ME!"
1,worse than one star rating.NO stars rate,"I want my money back. 3rd screw, keepers gone forever. thats a dollar a screw. JUNK. NOT HAPPY.WANT MY MONEY BACK or a sack full of these, so I can throw it away every 3rd screwrather surprised that Vermont American did this. they USUALLY have a good product. I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
3,good listening pleasure for the money,this cd had a much better selection of songs than most other cd's in this billboard category. still could have have better selection. the type of dance music varied too much. a few songs were of flip-side quality. it was still a good buy.
5,Ricky,This concert from the MTV Unplugged series is super good. For all Ricky Martin fans is a must have. Enjoy!
4,Works Great!,"As with an electric shaver, you don't get a blade smooth result. But considering the area that is being shaved, it works great.I've had it for quite some time (bought it last spring) and haven't had to oil it yet. Half the time I forget it in the shower and have gotten multiple shaves from a single charge. But again, I'm not shaving a large area.It works as expected."
3,Whale Spray kiddie Pool,"This pool is so cute and the babies love the spray - they hang out on that end of the pool the entire time. But the first time we blew it up the tail didn't hold air; it has a small hole and will not stay inflated, so we just tied it back out of the way. Otherwise the pool is a hit."
1,Ashley Tisdale- screwed up or awesome?!,"i personally think that she is full of herself. like in ""Not Like That"" she says that people are looking at her because she is beautiful, have you SEEN the back of her cd?! she looks like she is drunk, or constipated!!!!! also in one of her song she says that she could see her and a boy ""kissing like that, i could see us touching like that!!!!!"" nobody should even think about doing that!!!!! the only song that i like is headstrong! she put some effort into it, and that makes me feel better, but she needs to get over herself!!!!! hope that you liked and agreed about what i put, she doesnt have the best voice ever, but she has a lot more capabilities, and i want to see her use them in the RIGHT WAY!!!!!"
4,Industrial orchestral hip-hop chaos,"This is a weird album. It's clearly what most people would label ""industrial,"" yet there's orchestral overtones to the compositions. Inject some hip-hop, put it in a blender, and the end result? Something noisy, and hit-or-miss. I'm particularly fond of Dowager's Egg and Teapot."
5,Loved the series,"Started to read the series in the 80's It was my first"" end of the world book"" I ever read. I never did finish the series because I ended up going overseas and couldn't find them anymore. I Look forward to finding them again & reading them all over. Great books loved his ""tri-states philosophy"""
1,Wretched,"Insipid, overproduced pop dance music. Why can't Sheena sing in her real accent? But the cover's nice enough."
5,A snappy read,Excellent basic information with stories of teenagers who have put these ideas into practice. Clearly written with self-assessment tests to get your mind thinking. Every teenager would benefit from reading it since it takes the mystery out of wealth creation.
5,great product,"Product appeared to only available on line - it was a replacement for one that I had for years and unfortunately ""died"" this one was just what I wanted"
1,Check with Standard Deviants or Light Speed math,Please Check this product with Standard Deviants or Light Speed mathThe products and details are one and the sameHuge price differenceAlways keep it in mind Teaching Systems DVDs are expensived
3,"A sampling of Jochum's logy, uninspired Bruckner","To my ears, these Bruckner readings of Sym. #3 and #7 fall far short of the accolade ""wonderful"" as bestowed by the Amazon reviewer. Jochum's Third starts off mysteriously enough, until a blast of crude brass entries breaks the mood. There's a lot more brash, crude playing to come. Throughout the first and last movement Bruckner's energizing ostinato rhythms sound leaden instead of invigorating.The Seventh is a far greater work, and therefore Jochum's pedestrian reading, mostly slow and slack in every movement but particularly lugubrious in the Andante, has farther to fall. The Dresden Staatskapelle plays with no particular distinction, and EMI's sound is average for Seventies analog. In sum, the only reason to acquire this bargain two-fer is to find out if Jochum is your cup of tea, and then you can proceed to other installments or even invest in the whole set (which is quite cheap on the used market)."
5,Mao to Mozart,this DVD is excellent for anyone interested in classical music. Issac Stern visits China in the mid 1970's and finds western music is played but not with feeling. He encourages the players he meets and especially the young musicians and finds them very responsive. He revisits 20 years later and hears what happened to music professors during the cultural revolution. He meets again the young players he'd inspired and finds they have successful careers and remember his former visit with gratiude. I wish we had more DVD's of this type.
5,Probably one of the best pictorial books on Naval Aviation.,Mr. Larkins book has many rare photos and is one of the best if not the best Naval Aviation books around.
5,U.S. Navy Aircraft 1921-1941/U.S. Marine CorpsAircraft 1914,U.S. Navy Aircraft 1921-1941/U.S.Marine Corps Aircraft 1914-1959 by William T. Larkins is the best book I've found on Naval Aviation. Would love to see a book like this up to the present.This is really a great book.
1,Hard to believe,Just because Skipp Porteous had a bad experiance with the God based church doesnt mean that all God based church's are bad. I had a bad experiance with a Satanic cult and no one gives a hoot. Give it up and forgive God he's already forgiven you. Eternity is a long time do we want to spend it in Hell?
2,Author Deceived By Satan,"Mr. Porteous has misread and misquoted the Bible from beginning to end. There are no inconsistencies in the Bible. If the author had truly been a born again Christian, he could not have made the comments written in his book. Mr. Porteous needs to get his facts straight and get right with Jesus if, indeed, he ever knew him in the first place. I recommend the book for Christian apologists who wish to refute and rebut what the author has written. It will be good practice for them, although probably too easy. The book is blasphemous and should never be read by those not washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. Mr. Porteous is one of the false prophets spoken of in the Bible and he will someday find himself in eternal hell."
1,This is publication of very specialized nature,This is neither a book nor a catalogue of the Brooklyn museum collection. This publication consist of 24 color plates of the highlights of the Brooklyn museum collection accompanied by a small booklet with comments on each piece. It is of limited use to the general reader. You can have a much more information about ancient Egypt from other books of the same price range that cotain a lot more color photos of ancient Egyptian Objects. The format does not make it easy to read and access. This a very specialized publication that may be of use to someone who is studying Ancient Egypt and need to know the best of the Brooklyn museum collection in details.
1,Horrible,"This EP is the most awful music ever released by Prince. The remixes are so terrible it's hard to believe this is a Prince release. Take it from me, I'm one of the biggest Prince fans around and this release is horrible!"
1,"Garbage, Totally 0 stars",Buy The Original 1999 (from 1982)FROM WARNERS The Raps are totally uncalled for? He should have created a new song all together with the same Idea! For this we should call him THE FARTIST..
2,"OK, glad I didn't pay for it!","I know this may sound weird, but I actually did not pay for the ""new"" 1999 master. I actually downloaded it off the net to see if I wanted it first. A few of the songs sounded decent, but not good enough for me to pay $10 for it! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Hopefully ""Beautiful Strange"" will sound much better than this."
2,The Remixes Sucked..........,"I would give this CD two stars because the remixes sounds like orginial version. Although the NPG added a little new stuff but is does not help it at all. My favorite remix is ""Keepsteppin"" which is more funky than ""1999"" itself. The funky stuff keeps the CD from getting wacked. If you're not a Prince fan, I'll give you one star."
5,The best pci graphic card it works on every motherboard !,hey people i think this is the best graphic card because its like a normal vga card but this one is pci and its faster than the agp card buy it if you have a wierd motherboard like the one i have and i tried this one it gives great pictures and resolution .
4,a band that's evolving,"This album, along with Stupid Dream, was among the first works I heard of Porcupine Tree. This was also the first time in which Steven Wilson worked with a full band for an entire album.Experimental, eerie, psychedelic, it's like they took all of the progressive rock influences, put them in a blender, added a little ambient sounds and electronica, and let it rip. This album represents a mix of what Steven Wilson had been doing as basically a one-man band, and what they will eventually become.Sleep of No Dreaming, and Sever are some of the darker, harder tracks, and gives you a harbinger of things to come with the direction Porcupine Tree would eventually take. This album is also full of atmospheric, ambient instrumental tracks like Idiot Prayer, Intermediate Jesus, and Light Mass Prayers. Darkmatter, the final track, is one of my all-time favorite Porcupine Tree songs. Signify is definitely an album worth listening to."
5,Easily their best,"I heard In Absentia first, barely liked it enough to get this. My world has changed forever, this is my #1 favorite album ever. Too bad they forever changed directions after this release, by putting out the stinky Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. Im glad those albums are widely popular, but Signify(and Insignificance) is their greatest release."
3,Not what I expected,"Let me start by saying that I am admittedly new to Porcupine Tree. I bought Deadwing and thought it was a great CD. Given that, I decided to give Signify a shot. I can't say I was impressed. I bought it based on hearing The Intermediate Jesus. Being an old-school Brand X fan, I found this track intriguing and figured Signify must contain more of the same. Alas, it just didn't have much else to attract my attention. I'm sure a long-time Porcupine Tree fan would see it differently, but this CD was a bit of a let-down for me."
1,Awful,"Being a big fan of prog-metal, and some prog-rock, I must say this was the stupidest excuse for music I have ever heard. If you like bands such as DT or even Spock's Beard, you'll be dissapointed. I have heard good things about this band, but they were obviously bias views. The entire album is eerie sound effects, that don't even come close to giving you that feeling of pure enjoyment. Music to me consists of a band utilizing their skills in song writing and playing their instruments, not making random creepy symphonic sounds with some lyrics. Only if you're interested in the traits in which I listed, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!"
1,awful,"Porcupine tree is a terrible band. I randomly downloaded some songs, curious to hear what they sounded like. They repeat the same notes over and over then try and trip you out with some weird effects in the background. Then they get all new-age, pop sounding then try and sound hardcore. This band blows and is not worthy of being compared to pink floyd. If you like this band you have failed in life and dont know what good music is."
5,"""Signify"" is Brilliant","Porcupine Tree to me is the most exciting and intriguing new band which I have heard in way too many years. So much music today is mundane and requires very little talent but Porcupine Tree certainly is not in this class. What Porcupine Tree is to me is a band that has taken the best aspects of rock music over the past 30 years or so and refined into a sound all their own which just never gets boring. Their range of songs spreads a wide gap from ballads to rockers to soundscapes and that is the case on their incredible recording ""Signify"". In fact the song ""Signify"" is itself in my opinion worth buying the CD for because if you dare to crank it up your walls will tremble!"
5,Great kids book!!!,My main disagreement with the above review is that it is obviously written by an adult for adults. I do not believe most young children read a book for the reasons he complains about. I have not read this book in over 50 years but I still remember it well. I can remember lying in bed at night reading this book and dreaming that I was right there along side Toby and sharing his adventure. I will not give away any of the plot but I can also remember a scene where my little boy tears just flowed(in am age where little boys were not supposed to cry). I loved the book then and am now buying it for my grandson!!
3,Toby and Circus,This was a short but cute read. I'd recommend it for both adults and kids. I didn't check the publishing date but it's set in the time when the circus still traveled with wagons and horses.
3,not labeled as first of several volumes,"Buyer beware: although not labeled as such, this is only the first of what must have been intended as a multi-volume set. This goes from Lincoln's lineage through the early days of the Sumter crisis, prior to the inauguration."
1,HORRIBLE AND CONFUSING,"The book is largely a massive theoretically discussion with little attention toward real life. Simiarly, the book is too mathmatical which precludes a general understanding of the monetary system."
5,Good fun!,"This book was suggested by a friend and we weren't disappointed. A great book to read together. Heisenberg writes very well and clearly. Not easy for me but reading it with my husband, who can translate some of the more technical writing, is a lot of fun.The book was as described and delivered promptly."
1,Not conceptual,"My daughter used this textbook in her HS physics class and I was apalled with how much useless information it contained. Little to no historical information about who, what and when it was discovered and how it brought about changed. Her teacher used the chapter on the conservation of energy to talk about energy conservation, an entirely different subject. I agree with teaching the concepts of physics in HS before diving into the math in college, but there are much better texts available!"
4,Great instrumental blues 'n surf music!,"Jim Mesi is a mostly undiscovered talent except to those in Portland Oregon who recognize him as one the best blues guitarist around. This album is a great mixture of blues and old classic surf and 60's classics. Well-recorded, with a semi-live sound to it, you'll be rockin right in your own living room!"
5,Paulito F.G. y su Elite,This cd captures cuban music at it's best both new an old. It is a testament of how cuban music has evolved into a powerful force. Paulito has a rather simple voice but his band brings the rich rythms to another level. Ana Elena a salsa ballad features sensuous lyrics with a moving melody. I highly suggest this cd to any latin music lover.
4,"book in good condition, delivered quickly",fairly old book but was in good condition as advertised. Delivered in a timely manner without problems.
3,not so much,Mabye its my bird but this pruduct was too clumped together for her to really play with it. She REALY likes bells (she is a Cockatiel) and she STILL doesnt touch it after almost a year of me cycling it through her cage periodically. I would not recomend it for a Cockatiel or medium sized bird.
3,not really,"i really thought this birdie toy looked awesome, but my bird (green cheek conure) does not really pay attention to it. the vine rings clump together too much, even when toy is outstretched. he usualy loves bells, so much so that i purchase additional bells to add to toys, but he pays no attention to this one. i have introduced it 3 different times since april. i will try again to introduce it differently."
3,Marine Corps Blues,"As a former and always will be U.S. MARINE, I expected much better. Very basic brush over of our stunning history. There was so much more to be included. I gave it 3 stars out of courtesy for the subject matter. Hope this is taken as one man's honest opinion and nothing more or less."
4,Decent MP3 player.,"I'm pretty satisfy with the product.-The screen is pretty cool, it sort of rotate as you rotate the player up and down, so screen can still be seen at an angle.-The headphone is very nice, it fits my ear comfortably and sounds really great. Although it doesn't fit on my girlfriend's ear. If you have small ears, then you out of luck with this headphone.The down side about this player is BASS is reduced in the player. Same song playing on my computer will have much stronger bass. When I plug the mp3 player to speaker the bass is very low. I guess it's a function to protect your ear while using headphone, so if you don't plan to hook it up to speaker then it's no problem."
4,Good book,"I may have already done a review. I thought I did but don't know if it went through. I used to play trivia with the author and I don't read much but Shenandoah7, my trivia pal really wrote a good book. I don't know how to contact her now that I don't play trivia anymore and have to borrow a computer, but WTG Shenandoah7 aka, d.c.brown"
3,kind of disappointing,"I bought this book expecting it to be a basic guide on Man Ray's work. The problem is it happens to be a little too basic. You can't find Man Ray's most expressive work, except for ""Tears"" (only on the cover), ""Le Violin d'Ingres"", ""Mask of Woman"", ""Le Priere"" and a few Rayographs. It seems to be a biographic record instead of an art book, although it doesn't blur the genius of Man Ray's photographs."
5,received,we recieved this but one of the screws didn't work so we had to sub the old one which doesn't match the color
4,Spanish Texts,"I have taken several differnt spanish classes with a multitude of different Text books. This particular text is the one I have found most useful for self study. The work must be addressed as a text since for the most part all of the grammar that you must learn is only found in the workbook while the text book focuses more on culture and vocabulary. However, nothing replaces actual full emmersion in a language."
3,A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century,"The book is an excellent but very detailed account of the world of spies and Intelligence service. I can't put it down and can relate to the history, but the names, details and volume of facts are a little overwhelming."
3,A close third in my line-up,"Perhaps I was spoiled. I fell in love with Ayla (Clan of the Cave Bear series), and cried when Kwani died (She Who Remembers series). To me, Chagak paled in comparison. The other books seemed to draw me in from the beginning, make me wish I had lived in their time. In this book, I did not find my adrenaline pounding, or the next page screaming to be turned. Don't get me wrong, the book had its moments and was not at all bad. I was just hoping for something more after the reviews and recommendations. I am going to continue with Sue Harrison's other books."
5,More ...,"I love that I got to get remixes of Collide songs that I already love !!!! Plus a few covers..which is a prequel to the full cover album These Eyes Before which came out in 2009. I could listen to this cd over and over and I did on a 4 hour drive..I hate long drives and this cd kept me going !! The lyrics and vocals of kaRIn are hauntingly beautiful and sleek and have drawn me in from the first note. If you love remixes, this cd is a must. If you do not know Collide (yet) this a great introduction and you'll be craving more...who doesn't love to also hear the original version of a remix ??"
2,Still waiting for second glove,"Well, I must say that I'm quite disappointed about the service provided here.First, instead of a pair of hands I received only one single glove. After I wrote a mail to the seller I've been assured that I will get the second glove as soon as possible. However, after waiting for some weeks now there's still no sight of the promised glove...I just hope it will get here sometime soon...The only positive things I can say about this product, is that it is really well made (color, material,...).But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with small hands, as it is just too big (like a real workers-glove).All in all, I wish I could write a positiver review for this product, as I really like the idea behind it and intend to use it more often for horror-LARP, but without the second glove it would be quite difficult.Natalia"
1,I'll let you know when I can use it...,"First saw was badly damaged and didn't come with stand (ships in separate box). Second saw damaged (not as badly as first) and manufacturer is working with me (for nearly a month now) to get me replacement parts. Fedex says they will deliver tomorrow 12/23/10. Hopefully they are the right parts. My tiling project is horribly behind. Oh, yes... the second saw came without a stand as well but the manufacturer sent one right away. Hoping the saw works well once I can use it!"
2,works well,"works fine, but I gave it 2 stars because These locks are way over priced for what they are."
3,Should not have bought,Bought these because I also bought the Thule Sidekick storage for my van. No where in the description did it tell you that the locks came with it and it had on the bottom of the page that the people that bought the Thule also bought the Locks so I got them and didn't need them because they came with the Sidekick. Didn't go to the trouble of returning them.
4,They Lock,"They lock, I use a key to open them and they lock. Exceptional concept for keeping your Thule just barely secure."
4,They Work,"These lock cylinders are easy to install and are an easy way to key all your Thule accessories the same. As with all of my reviews of Thule products, my biggest complaint is their excessive price."
1,don't use with Insta-Gator truck rack,"Bought this for Thule Insta-Gator truck bed rack.Two reasons this was a bad idea: 1) it didn't work. Not even a little. It's supposed to engage the sliding hook arm release lever, but the internal plastic bits don't quite mesh.2) The Insta-Gator itself works well as far as it goes,and I like it, but even if the lock worked, it offers zero security. To start, it only engages the front wheel. And while the metal parts are quite rugged, it relies on easily-defeatible plasticware too hold it to the truck and to hold the hook arm in place. Lock-wise, you'd be better off with a cable lock tied to the truck."
5,Loved it!!! <3,"This book is so cute!!! I love it!!! And it's so helpful!! The pictures are well drawn, making it easier to understand what each individual item is translated in Japanese. I received the book so quickly, it arrived within the week that I purchased it! Thanks again Amazon!! The book is great!!! And was in terrific condition! <3"
2,Buy an Ace Compilation Instead,"I am a huge fan of Big Sandy, and also a huge fan of the songs covered on this cd, and I have to say that I was disappointed - the whole cd sounds like Pat Boone crashed an Elvis movie. Instead I recommend the Ace Compilation ""Teenage Rock and Roll Party"", it contains the originals of a few of the songs. Brightest spots were the title track, Queen of My Heart, and Hey Senorita... worst was YamaYama Pretty Mama, it does a disservice to the extremely fun original. Buy Swingin' West or On the Go if you want high-quality Big Sandy music!"
5,midnight in ruby bayou,"DO I LOVE THE DONOVANS? THANK YOU ELIZABETH LOWELL. I HAVE READ ALL OF YOUR BOOKS; THE OLDEST TO THIS NEW ONE. I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN.I FELL IN LOVE WITH OWEN WALKER AND FAITH DONOVAN AND THEIR STORY. FAITH HAS A TALENT TO DESIGN JEWELRY; FAITH HAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY THAT LOVES HER; BROTHER ARCHER WANTS HER PROTECTED AND THE RUBYS; ENTER THE WONDERFUL MAN, WALKER. THANK YOU E.LOWELL FOR THE PLOT OF WHO HAS TAKEN THE BIG FIST OF A RUBY; AND THE SEXUAL, SWEET STORY OF LOVE BETWEEN FAITH AND WALKER. ""SUGAR"" THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. ""SUGAR"" THIS HAS GREAT LOVE-SEX SCENES............KEEP UP THE GREAT STORIES E.LOWELL WITH HOT SEX................LOVE YOUR BOOKS..........A GREAT BOOK FOR ANYONE."
4,Ruby Bayou,This was another one of Lowell's well written gem stories. I loved Walker's character. A cool and talented southern gentleman.
4,My first Lowell book,I enjoyed it - I found the characters to be interesting and likeable. I thought the plot could have been more suspenseful.
5,Good Read,"I thought this was the best of the whole series. When I finished this one, I wanted more. It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what could possibly happen next."
1,Disappointed,"After reading books such as Pearl Cove and Jade Island I found this book to be dull and uninspiring. Elizabeth Lowell's books generally keep riveted for I connect with her characters so much that while I am reading one of her books I feel as if i am right there witnessing it. I found this book to be vastly annoying, contrite and utterly disappointing. After having heorines like Honor I could not understatnd how she could write a book in which her character fell flat. The storyline never stays consistent and keeps bringing in new characters that are unexplained and have no place in this story. She draws the book out with the tale of this ghost walking the shores and then ends it abruptly with some simpered tale of a stillborn child. Sorry Elizabeth, but definetly not your best work."
3,not so bad yet not one of her better ones,This book starts off really smoothly with an intro to the plot and all and we are able to seen and experience the chemistry all in all it was really captivating except for the rushed ending
4,Exciting and Enjoyable...................,"Had to read this book after reading Pearl Cove and enjoying yummmmmmmmy Archer Donovan and his love Hannah. Faith Donovan the youngest sister and jewelry designer and Owen Walker best friend and Ruby expert goes with Faitn Donovan to the Bayous for her best friends wedding and to present her a beautiful Ruby Necklace. But, the Heart of Midnight a giant ruby is lost and a Russian is trying to find it and murder anyone who gets in his way and Faith may be next. I really enjoyed this one. I would like her to write about their twin brothers and the Emerald trade,but I highly doubt it. Looking forward to reading Color in Death by her and all about Sapphires. Read this book it's highly recommend."
4,Midnight in Ruby Bayou,"I loved it! I am a huge EL fan. I could (and have) read her books over and over again. Her stories are so sensual and just plain hot! When Walker first came on the scene in Jade Island, I hoped he would be the next Lowell hero! Are we going to hear from Justin & Lawe next(even if we've never met them yet...)? Elizabeth Lowell rocks!"
3,"A lot of potential, but didn't make the grade","I thought the premise of the book was very interesting, and I liked the characters a lot. However, the plot had a little trouble moving forward, since we had to learn so much about the ruby business (not that it wasn't interesting, but it could have been a little neater). And, I got a little confused as to where all these bad guys were coming from. But, it was a light easy read, so it would be good beach reading. I would have liked a little more suspense, though."
5,"I found this book to be a ""must read"" for every parent.","Whatever happened to the innocence of childhood? The Medveds do a great job showing how that innocence is being stripped by the media, by the schools, and often by parents themselves in an attempt to ""prepare"" children for the real world. Instead, we are rearing frightened, cynical children, who are actually less able to handle the pressures of growing up, and who are less likely to become psychologically healthy adults.I highly recommend this book, and plan on buying an additional copy for a pregnant friend."
2,Lots of holier-than-thou wading to reach the worthwhile.,"There are some very valuable points to ponder brought up by the Medveds. Unfortunately they are over-the-top in sharing their own lives in a nauseating self-congratulatory way. Dr. Garbarino's ""The Lost Boys"" was a much better read, and I am optimistic that some sort of primer incorporating his and the Medved's points will be made available to the general public."
3,"Three stars for B-movie fans. Otherwise, two stars.","If you like Martin & Lewis, The Bowery Boys, or Abbott & Costello, this one is worth checking out. The production crew usually worked on Abbott & Costello and Bowery Boys movies, and this silly jungle comedy is no worse (and sometimes better) than its higher-budgeted rivals. Nightclub comics Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo do a good Martin & Lewis imitation (in some scenes you'd swear you were watching Jerry Lewis). The aging Lugosi, playing yet another evil scientist, delivers his usual professional performance, and even does romantic scenes convincingly. Saturday-matinee stuff, but fun for B-movie fans."
5,Great Box,Great aluminum box. Would buy again. Strong Case for any project and great for RFI or EMI. I would always use Hammond.
2,"OK, but not great",I have neuropathy due to chemotherapy and my feet always feel cold. I thought these would be a blessing but they really don't do much better than a good pair of socks and slippers.
5,Great books!,"John Hagee never ceases to amaze me with his knowledge and devotion to the Word of God.If you want to learn about the Bible from one of the world's greatest preachers, I recommend his books and sermons always."
2,Okay if you enjoy a good heresy / misinterpretation of Revelation,"Hagee writes very well. His experiences are very interesting, but he absolutely misses the mark in his dominion theological approach. If you buy into his view, it is a good read."
3,Needs a rewrite or two,"""Into the Darkness"" starts with an awesome idea, and there are some points where it almost delivers on its initial promise. The strengths that Turtledove is famous for, namely warfare and battle scenes, are clearly evident. However, we should expect better writing from an author of his caliber.....In the end, I only awarded this book three stars by a very narrow margin. Turtledove didn't put enough time and effort into it to make it truly worth reading, unless you're bored and have nothing better to do. If you'd like to read a much better blending of high fantasy and war story, I recommend George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Fire and Ice."""
1,Has Turtledove Lost his Touch?,"As a total fan of all prior books by this author I was very happy when this book came out. But it really fell short. First of all, there are way too many characters, which prevents the reader from getting to really know or care about any of them. There are also too many different sides and none of them are clearly good or evil. Maybe this is supposed to be some deep philosophical message about the pointlessness of war, but it makes for a pretty pointless story. I regret the time I wasted trying to read through this. Even more, I regret the time that Harry Turtledove, probably my favorite author, wasted writing it, time that could have been better spent writing something interesting and exciting like the WorldWar series!"
4,review,Looked way cooler in person. Made out of quality materials and looks like it will hold up for a long time.
2,"Heard better...not ""best album of year"" :)","I bought Spineshank when seeing the ""Asthmatic"" video on MTV several times, and I thought that this album would be great. I am sorry to say, but this is another album which has only a ""hand full"" of descent songs. The single thing that turned me away from this, is that it has a little TOO much techno, it doesn't feel or sound balanced between techno and metal. I don't think that this band is heavy enough for me. For a truly, balanced, industrial band, I would listen to Fear Factory. Fear Factory has just enough techno/electronica, and it doesn't make the overall sound too muddy. I think that Fear Factory's ""Obsolete"" and ""Demanufacture"" are some awesome albums."
5,Simply Amazing,"Man, Spineshank really, really kick a$$. I heard New Disease, bought the album, and quickly discovered several other favourites like 'Play God' and 'Negative Matter'. It's a little old, but if you can find this anywhere, buy it for sure."
4,Rap-Rock? Hardly!!,"Why a previous reveiwer labeled this as ""rap-rock"" is completely wrong. The sound is closer to Ministry, the first band to combine industrial with metal. This album is in that vein of music. Similar bands include Fear Factory and Static-X. But enough on that. Spineshank's latest effort is an excellent one, combining heavy,noisy sounds with subtle melody.The combination is a great one indeed,with a good mix of techno/trance with thrash metal.Standout tracks would be ""Asthmatic"",""the Height of Callousness"", and ""Cynacide 2600"".If you like the previously mentioned bands, and/or Pitchshifter and Rammstein, you should definitely check this talented band out."
5,Good Tread Size,"I'm hoping to use this tire for a long time.Cost was reasonable, and it seems like a good quality make."
1,The worst movie....EVER!,"It only got one star because I couldn't give it a zero, This movie is unbelievable bad. No one in the theatre laughed at all, not ever once. (I could hear Crickets cherping it was so quiet.)How they roped Billy Crystal into this mess is beyond me. Please... Trust me, don't see this movie. You'll be begging for that 90 minutes of your life back."
4,Quiet & Effective Air Cleaner,"I already had the larger Winix 9000 that works great for the open floor planned downstairs. So figured the smaller 9000s would be great for my newborn daughters room. It works great in eliminating smells such as poopey smells and other odors. And it is quiet, which was an absolute must since it is in the nursery. I don't know if the allergens have been reduced downstairs or in her room since I still have allergy symptoms when I am home...Anyway I wish I bought the 9000 on Amazon to save some money, but thankfully I bought the 9000s on Amazon, much cheaper than on the winix website. I plan on buying another 9000s for our bedroom in the near future."
4,A Wonderful Discovery on Eleventh Street,"Told entirely by its compelling cast of characters, this fast-read snapshot of one block on Manhattan's East Eleventh Street on one summer day burrows into an addictive blend of interactive stories that left me feeling like I've lived there for awhile and thirsting for what tomorrow might bring. The pitch-perfect voice of each character, whether speaking or thinking, lent an audio veracity to the time and place that called forth Hubert Selby Jr.'s Brooklyn and Richard Price's New Jersey. Ms. Nilva showed me the human core of people easy to avoid on the street, sending me away with a little more humanity of my own. An excellent gift for those who love to read, who read to love and who want to be changed by the experience. A wonderful discovery."
2,COPIES OF POSTERS,BOUGHT 2 POSTERS....VERY POOR COPIES OF POSTERS....LETTERING WAS BLURRY & PIXELATED....FACES ON THE POSTERS LOOKED OVER EXPOSED....NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT THESE.
4,These wipes are great for washing hands and ...,"These wipes are great for washing hands and faces. We put them in the van and are using them on the go. They're smaller than other wipes, which makes them perfect for little hands. And they come in a nice container, perfect for storing in a diaper bag or backpack."
1,Not enough info,"This is not a slight toward Amazon because it is impossible to have all the information about everything, but it needs to be mentioned that there is no teachers manual or even a solutions manual with this item. I don't usually see Alpha Omega products sold with out it. It would take a lot of work on the teacher to use this."
5,The man that really brings out what Bach is really all about,"I am truly amazed by the performances in this recording. When I was a teenager I had the chance to listen to Mr. Gavrilov live. He had played a transcription of a Tschaikovsky Symphony which he did with incredible aptitude and grace. I never forget that occasion. At the end of the concert, after having played about six extra pieces I remember him saying: ""I can play on and on but the piano is tired."" A true enthusiasm of a real artist. I truly recommend this recording to anyone who loves Bach."
2,An extremely biased one sided book...,"It does not present both sides fairly,it is heavily pro Palestinian and alsmost sounds like Hamas propaganda."
3,"cool art, cheap decal",the shirt looks really cool on the net and when you first get it but dont wash it or wear it cuz it dont look good for to long after
5,Nice wake up scent,"This soap has a very clean scent that I really like the smell of. I have tried other Dial soaps, but this is my favorite."
4,This product is great like the rest of ...,"This product is great like the rest of the Dial products. The only difference is the scent, which I found to be quite pleasant!"
5,The Best!,"Listeners who want to hear the very best recording of perhaps the best Viennese operetta should listen to this one. Gedda, Schwarzkopf,and Loose are splendid, but Kunz's witty, warm combination of dialog and singing provides the spice wich makes this an extremely satisfying performance."
3,Gedda and Schwarzkopf don't save it,"This is an energetic preformance (in German) which is crisp and delightful. Dialog between musical sections is spoken. ADD is not as deep and clear a sound as DDD. The New Sadler-Wells recording (Wordsworth, Smith, Harrhy, et al) beats this, in my opinion, despite Gedda and Schwarzkopf."
4,Should be on your shelf,"If you are an aspiring artist and want to really do well with your medium, than you need to have this book on your shelf. It is completely full of critical information, all of which is highly applicable. This book isn't bogged down with useless rhapsodizing about notions of beauty, timeless composition or passion. It is bare bones 'what works, what doesn't' information, all intended to accomplish one end; permanence of artwork.I have been doing some very exhaustive searching for technical guidance for oil painting, and while this book covers several topics aside form oil painting it is still contains vital information. Keep it at hand. Read a few of the very information dense pages whenever you have an idle moment."
3,Decent Book,"I had thought of as this book as ""The Joy of Cooking"" for artists...However there may be quite a bit of information for artists, but in someways I felt as if the book was lacking. I hesitate to say this because as a painter there is a great deal of information. On the other hand, the book lacks information in other media. With all of that said, as an artist, this book could round out some knowledge, but you may come up short if you're not a painter. The timeliness of delivery and condition of the book was excellent."
5,Need great tasting vegetable recipes? Then this is the book.,"This is my #1 cookbook for vegetable recipes. Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Many thanks to Jack Bishop for his work."
5,Eating Vegetables,I am a health conscious person but was not a fan of vegetables. This book offers so many great recipes to make every vegetable tasty. I really enjoy roasting and grilling the vegetables. It is also great to learn about foods in the produce aisle that I would normally pass. A great way to eat a rainbow of vegetables.
5,The Complete Audiobook on Medical Transcription Part I of II,"This book is electrifying. It carries the listener step by step through the processes of becoming a medical transcriptionist.The listener will feel as if they are in the classroom. Each and every concept is taught in the manner of basic skills. Your questions are answered and you can always rewind to capture high peak understanding.The language is given in lay person mannerism. This engages the listener in a way to decrease anxiety yet embrace all concepts.You will be a professional transcriptionist upon completion.I recommend it to any high school graduate, young adult and above whom wish to make a very good living at home!The book focuses on an introduction to medical transcription, ergonomics, medical terminology, medical procedures, and grammar, live physician dictations and"
3,"Great Scent, But Not ""Extra Moisturizing""","On the plus side, I love the cherry-almond smell...one of the reasons I tried this was because I really like the almond scent ofMethod Wood For Good Spray, 12-Ounce Spray Bottles (Pack of 6)and this is just like it.On the other hand, I did not find it especially moisturizing, and certainly not ""extra moisturizing"". I actually found my hands were dryer overall after I switched to this. It's a decent hand wash and I'll finish the bottle, but in the future I'll have to stick to cleaning my wood furnishings to get my almond-scent fix."
1,Not good at all,"I am using SMC products since last 1.5 years,I was satisfied with all other SMC products,but not this.Reason:- Its just running @ 2MPBS speed, thought my router is supporting 11 MPBS.- I called customer support, they are confuse too, asking all networking stuff to do again & again,but no luck. (SMC customer support is always better than N'gear & D'link)- I dont know what to do with this 65 USD baby?-also the size in the pictures look small,but its not real, size is larger than thumb drive.Otherwise, i hv good exp. with SMC products only this makes me crazy, but thats OK"
1,"NOT GOOD, NOT EVEN CLOSE","I'll admit I took a blind chance on buying this CD. I wish I hadn't. In my opinion it's NOT GOOD, NOT EVEN CLOSE, and I blame myself for buying it. I must not ""get"" Halloween music that's new wave, since I was completely disappointed with this compilation. Here's my advice for most people over 40 years old: DON'T BUY THIS CD!!!!!!"
3,zombie must buy.. zombie must buy...,"If for you Halloween is a good excuse to party in the middle of the week, then maybe it's also a good excuse to buy this CD. ""Thriller"", however, is conspicuously absent, and you just can't have a Halloween party without some guy getting sloshed and trying to Moonwalk. Maybe it would have ruined the feel of the record, sandwiched in between The Misfits and Sonic Youth? The B-52's doing ""Devil in my Car"" is a nice touch, so is Ministry, and you can't beat the six versions of ""Halloween"" on one disc that you don't have to make yourself. There's all kinds of other stuff that *could* have fit the bill if you're calling Dead Kennedys, Sonic Youth and Misfits new wave.. whatever. The theme is basically there - but there's a long way between Sonic Youth and the Rocky Horror theme. I'm still a real sucker for cheap comps like this."
2,Hitman - Bloodmoney,"The CD was as expekted but it did not include the track that plays at the menu in the Game. If anyone wonders about the name of it I can tell it is Franz Schubert - Ave Maria, the singer is a boy I dont have the name of. I was stupid to think it should be more of this genre on the CD, I have not finished the game yet so I thought there should be more of such songs on the CD."
5,A must-have version,"This is my favorite version of Mahler Symphony No.6. Some people may think that there is too much of tragedy right from the beginning and the starting tempo is a little draggy compared to most other versions. But I don't feel that way at all. In contrast, I think Barbirolli's expression and tempo is just absolutely right. There is a real sense of tragedy and our MAN in the music is determined in facing the fate. Put it in short: this performance is the most convincing and satisfactory to me."
5,One of the best Zombie franchise out there!,Mila jovovich at her best as Alice. These movies have totaled 4 to sat with a new one on the way. Apocalypse is by far one of the best so far.
1,Different Director bad move,"I liked the first Resident Evil, the visual style, the camera angles, the lighting, the characters, the casting, the sound track. The fact that they tried to stay true to certain aspects of the video game like the Train, and the scene where the guy was crawling towards Mia Jovavich was right out of the video game. Plus I liked the flow of the movie. I wasn't that impress when I first watched it but I find my self going back to it and watching it time and time again.The second Resident Evil (apocolypse) is alot different. poor lighting, quick flashy camera work(can you say music video) the movie has no flow, the music sounds like some old nintendo video game music, the cheesy one liner attempts, it just seemed like a bunch of action sequences that had no connection to each other, the flow of the movie was bad. I wish I would have rented this one instead of buying it. This was also the first DVD that the special features are actually better than the Movie itself."
3,Not what I expected.,"I bought this a couple weeks later after its release and it was not what I expected.- The bad thing id that the main menu is the same as in Apocalypse, it doesn't have any of the special features from the first one, and you can't choose between full screen and wide screen like the second one.- The good thing is that it includes a few clips from the third one and a few new featurettes.If you buying it for the special features, wait for the third one to come out on DVD and have the collection separate to enjoy both movies better."
1,Wish I could see it,"I failed to try and watch it within my 30 days and am now stuck with a useless DVD. The back has too many scratches for my DVD player to even be able to read it. Right now I wonder who should replace it since it was never viewed. Even the special features DVD looks pretty cruddy on the back. The other DVDs from the same shipment all arrived fine. This was obviously bad before it shipped to me.So I purchased a second one and darn if there isn't something screwy going on with some DVDs. The second one looks fine, but like my THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH dvd, it will not play in my regular DVD player. Somewhat of a fortunate bit of luck, I have a mobile player this second one will work in.Do I now return the second one by shipping the first one back? I am still stuck with one that was damaged when it was created and one that won't play in a normal DVD player."
5,A Great Sequel,"I really loved this movie and it takes alot to get me to say that about a Sci-Fi movie. It is also one of the best sequels to come out of Hollywood in a long time.The movie is action packed with a high scare factor, but where Apocalypse excels is with a well-crafted back story and compelling characters. I really appreciated the fact that the movie wasn't dumbed down to merely gore and action, but made you think about what was going on.This movie reaches very close to Aliens and The Thing (1982) in quality."
4,Good Sequel,"This is a great sequel to the original. Although it didn't seem as dark and scary as the first, it made up for it in action. The movie picks up where the first one left off. As our heroine has escaped the hospital she finds a devastated world. She must find her only surviving friend and do what she can to bring the Umbrella Corporation down. She finds out more horrible truths about them and is assisted by a unlikely allie. Both movies complement each other nicely. I definitely recommend you add this to your Horror/SciFi collection. A must for anyone that owns ""Resident Evil"". I am looking forward to the third movie in this set."
4,Better than the first....,"I was surprised at just how good this movie was! I am really glad that they turned it into more of a political and psychological thriller instead of just us having to watch Alice and Co. run around killing mindless zombies. I really liked the underlying political statements that were made concerning corporations and media control. This flick is great for those seeking a slightly more ""intellectual"" movie, and for those who simply want to sit back in their stadium seats with some buttered popcorn and have a good time. I hope the next one will be even better...."
3,RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE,"ITS A EXCELLENT MOVIE, THE FIGHT SCENE A REALLY GOOD. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THE BLU-RAY I RECEIVE THE PART WHERE ALICE WAS WAKING UP ALL ALONE IN THE HOSPITAL A SMALL PART WAS CUT OUT. I SEEN THAT MOVIE MORE TIME THAN I CAN REMEMBER THAT WAY I KNOW."
2,Lame movie topped off with a bad dvd transfer,"This movie is quite gastly when compaired to the first resident evil,I mean this movie hade a cheese factor of 8 out of 10 it is quite obvious that there was a differant director who made the movie. if you like the games then stick to the first movie it's much better and so is the video transfer, for some reason they gave this movie a really bad transfer, none of the blacks are black and the color is washed out I was fooling around with my color and brightness controls throughout the whole movie."
4,great sequel!,first off! to people who are trashing this movie due to its lack of content are stupid. the plot is not subjected in this movie as its an action flick. second milla perfromance was good better then the first and the supporting cast faired well. the only beef everyone keeps pointing out is no light or angles hello! its a dark movie and has visual style dynamics and the sound effects were incredbly loud in this movie then the last. if i had one problem with this film is when filming they made to much noise around my neighbourhood near toronto. thanx guys!
5,HMMMM...,"Ok first of all there is some similarity in the games, in the resident evil series of movies 1 was resident evil 1+2 and apocalypse will have 2+3. Also the main reason their budget got cut was that they knew that they were making a horrible movie and couldn't make enough money for a second one. And finally I would like to quote Kevin collins ""This movie needs to have a better story line that goes a long with the movie."" You mean goes along with the game."
2,1st film was better,"The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money!"
2,But it seemed like a great idea for a book,"Boring, pretentious, long-winded. Reads like a nightmare textbook authored by the most overblown professor on campus. The theories about sexual shortcomings and/or deviations being responsible for Hitler being Hitler are ridiculous."
5,Hitler the man,"A very well thought out book, that makes you think about one of the most historical characters in our time, it gives a brilliant depiction into many of the assumptions regarding this piece of history"
3,great book,The book looks like it was manufactured at an angle...hard to read because it's slanted and some print missing. But great material.
2,Shadows of the Future,"Mike Resnick is my favorite writer. His style as seen in Santiago, the Widowmaker series, Birthright, Bully, et al, is one of ironic satrirical cynicism. Walpurgis 3 gives the reader an insight into the development of this style as it grew into brilliance. This is a shadow of the brilliance to come."
2,Latter-day Godfather wheezes through the holidays,"This music (originally released in 1999 as ""Merry Christmas Album"") gets an A for effort but a C- for delivery. JB gets high marks for cowriting 10 new songs, but the backing tracks are warmed-over new jack swing and ""The Hardest Working Man In Show Business"" is showing his age - to put it kindly. As a big fan, I found the album fascinating (if not enjoyable), but everyone else is advised to seek out James' stellar late 60's Christmas recordings. SeeFunky Christmas,20th Century Masters: The Christmas Collection, or - best of all -The Complete James Brown Christmas."
3,Lovely nuggets,"I ran across this book while in High School in the 60's and loved it. A collection of short gems with some discussion and references to the source. Each entry about a page. Here are a few things I remember to this day:1) Conflicts within a group beget rules.2) Group rules beget conflicts.The original was stated with more scientific language, but you get the point.Another favorite is a list of 28 motivations, most of them paired with their opposite (Need affiliation vs. Need rejection).Anyway, it's a unique collection of short pieces on wide ranging topics to read randomly. With the passage of years, it's likely a cross between enduring wisdom and quaintness."
4,Lovely album with a lot of variations and sounds !,Went through the whole TD catalogue and have to say this does rate as one of TD's best albums in light of the albums produced in Edgar's 'music factory' subsequent to this! It has great depth to it with sounds which I only heard on the new KEF speakers I recently purchased.....shows a lot of ooomph! which demonstrated the time and care taken to produce this album.Highly recommended!
2,Not what I expected at all after a long wait to be released.,I've been waiting for this book to come out because I thought it would have information on a Chinese Wedding that I could share with my daughter. The books has very little information on Chinese Weddings other than why a bride wears red which is a lucky color and the traditional wedding outfit. I was hoping for more infomation like the tea ceremony and other things.This book is basically about a young girl that fears that her Uncle will no longer have a special place in her heart and life for her once he gets married. And the artwork is not what I'd call the best. For me this was a long wait for just a OK book. This book could have had great potiental and done so much more.
1,Total Junk,"I'm not sure how this is getting higher reviews. It can't even hold a regular mountain bike properly, The thin material bends under load. It would be great to hold just helmets. I purchased two of these, they are both sitting on the floor in a corner bent up, taking up space while I decide what to use them for."
4,Space Saver,"This is a really good space saver and it opened up my studio room so neatly. It fits both my road bike and my mountain bike. IT came with 4 screws and I was intending to put it on a drywall right above my couch like a masterpiece painting and it looks great!!; so I had to go buy the drywall screws first to make sure they are on the one wall nice and snug. The shelf works great! I put my gloves, shoes, and helmet on it so everything is all there and ready to go whenever I want it. It's a great buy. I recommend it to anyone."
2,Falls of the wall,"I bought two of these. One for my Trek 5000 carbon racer which is really light. The rack holds it well.The second is for my sons older Raleigh clunker. It's heavier but not super heavy. It rips the rack out of the wall. I have both mounted into cinder block using number 1/4"" plastic anchors and a number 14 screw. The leverage on the small securing plate is extreme. Why didn't Racor make the plate longer? or use 3 screws? or have a supporting bracket at 45 degrees from the rack to the wall? The pressure on the top screw is immense. I will try a lead anchor to see if that will hold.So if you are going to screw this into wood, make sure you have a very secure anchoring spot and a light bicycle, or get a different bike rack that distributes the weight better."
3,Bike Rack,Surprisingly strong and relatively easy to install. Frees up some space on the garage floor and my two boys find it pretty easy to take their bikes on and off.
2,Nice while it lasted.,"This review is for the single wall mount. I bought it about a year ago. Installation was easy, and, initially, it worked very well. However, after less than a year of moderate use, trying to keep my bike as centered as possible on the mount, the holder has bent severely to one side. As of right now, it still holds the bike, but I don't expect it to last much longer (and it looks ghetto). The torque to one side also cause the mounting plate to dig into the dry wall. I know this is a cheap product, so my expectations weren't that high, but it should last more than a year. I won't be buying from this brand again."
2,rack is good for lighter bicycles,"This is not a safe design. I installed it and here are my comments.PROS:* easy installation* lightweight* space savingCONS:* not safe for heavy bikes. the triangle piece that hold the bike up is not continuous (not one piece). it hooks to the sides of the bike holder by about 1.5 inches each side, and rests at the base. so, if you push the bikes sideways a little, the whole thing will fall on top of you because the hooks slip out!! i know this because it happened to me. (i pushed it sideways to see if it is sturdy - NOT A GOOD IDEA). I had to rig it to make it work...by tying ropes so the triangle piece will not slip out.* not for heavy bikes (example...mountain bikes)* not big enough to hold two adult bikes (they don't both fit in the grooves provided)"
4,Nice Kit,"This is a very good kit for the money. Aside from a few modifications -- sanding, building up a few areas etc.,this is overall, an excellent product."
4,Minus one for being slightly boring.,"I liked the overall view of this book somewhat, but the ending was really cool, I was like, ""Cool!"" I had no idea what was going to happen. R.L. Stine did a good job on this one!"
4,good.. but not so good,"overall, a very good book and storyline, the writing, is a bit slacked, sometimes, there's just too much of a description! you don't realy need to know so much.. and when u read the end.. it's like, but that's what i THOUGHT!!! hehe"
3,The Monkey Squawks...,"THE MONSTER WALKS is a perfect sub-zero budget fright feast! There's a big house full of secret passages, a raging thunderstorm, creepy servants, a dead guy in an upstairs bedroom, a lurking killer, and a crazed chimpanzee in the basement (this mad ape has a shriek that'll pucker up your armpits)! Mischa Auer lumbers along in his usual way, proving once again that he is the poor man's Boris Lugosi / Bela Karloff. While there are no true monsters in this movie, I still found it enjoyable enough for repeat viewings. Show it at your next horror ho-down..."
1,Monster of Comedy,"In 1931, Universal Pictures released ""Frankenstein"", starring Boris Karloff. Instead of joining Paramount Pictures, and other studios on the brink of Depression Era receivership, Universal thrived! Americans flocked to see the Monster. Poverty Row studios tried to cash in with their own ""Monster"" flicks. Thus was born ""The Monster Walks"", released in 1932. The story involves people in an old dark house on a stormy night menaced by a killer ape(see short man in gorilla costume). If extremely poor filmaking intrigues you, pick up this lemon. Otherwise, save your dollar. The sets are so cheap they waver, and threaten to collapse at any time.One bright spot is the performance of Mischa Auer, a Russian actor emmigrant in a small part as Hanns. One year later, he'd shine working for Howard Hawks in the classic ""Viva Villa"". ""The Monster Walks"" plods forward at a pace a snail could challenge. In fact, the Monster doesnt't walk, it crawls."
4,I was very impressed with the way this ...,"I was very impressed with the way this product felt when I was in the shower. It had a wonderful aroma and when I used it on my body, it left my skin feeling soft and clean. It lathered up very nicely and a small amount goes a long way."
2,Slow.....,"Using this with a 2009 MacPro ""Nehalem"" 2.66 GHz with 8GB RAM running 10.5.8This card is SLOW! I have no benchmarks but transfers are slower than the built in FW 400 in my 2.0 GHz Macintosh G5 and built in FW 400 in my Toshiba Satellite Laptop. I've tested it with several SATA drives in FW cases as well as PATA drives, both 3.5 and 2.5 sizes. Cases had both Oxford 911, 912 and LSI chipsets.I'll be looking for one with an NEC chipset next. Hope that will be better. I hear Macs work better with them."
2,Not what I was expecting,I gave it a 2 because it is good right hand only music. I was expecting an advanced music book to have both right and left hand notes. Instead this only has right hand. Make sure to understand this is ONLY right hand if interested in buying! Wasn't too thrilled when I figured it out after it was delivered.
4,Great book with jagged layout,"This is a well written though brief historical overview of the early years of the German nightfighter force in WW2. For its compact (less than 100 9"" x 12"" pages) size, there are lots of great pictures, color illustrations, biographies, anectdotal accounts, and techical descriptions of the men and equipment that comprised the Nachtjagd. My only complaint is that the number of these sidebars which sometimes are as large as three pages, interrupt the reading of the historical narrative which is actually the most interesting part of the book. One of the primary purposes of this series seems to be to clarify and illustrate the color, camouflage and markings of the aircrafts used by the Luftwaffe. To that end I would like to see more than just profiles of the aircraft which are illustrated. There also seem to be a few tiny errors in the identification of aircraft, but overall I am very happy with this book and would highly recomend it to anyone, especially scale modelers."
4,Decent chase novel,Another in the Jane Whitfield series. In this one Jane takes on hiding Las Vegas Casion executive Pete Hatcher - who knows a little too much and is no longer trusted by the Casino owners. The bounty hunters hired to bring Hatcher in are more psychopathic and perhaps dangerous than what Jane has dealt with so far. Nice chase scene in the Idaho-Montana-Canadian border.
2,Not Perry's Best,"Thomas Perry is a terrific writer, and I greatly enjoyed the first two entries in his Jane Whitefield series, but SHADOW WOMAN was a disappointment to me. The book suffers from long stretches of tedium and some serious lapses in plausibility. The two villains, supposedly ultracompetent supercriminals, seem amateurishly inept at times, and the good guys' narrow escapes often owe more to luck than skill. An awful lot of time is spent on Jane's marital problems, which might have been more interesting if we could figure out why she married this guy in the first place. Readers unfamiliar with the Jane Whitefield series would be better off reading VANISHING ACT and DANCE FOR THE DEAD, both of which are solid, five-star thrillers that show Perry at the top of his game."
1,2nd cracked seat of this model in 1 months time!!,Toilet seat cracked on second day we had it. Underside of seat has only 2 plastic pads placed towards the front of seat. Weight is not evenly distributed like on our old seat that had 4 pads (Lasted 10 years). Seat cracked half way between pad and hinges on back of seat. This purchase was to replace 1 of 2 seats we had ordered just a month ago from amazon and figured crack in that one was a fluke.I would not recommend this seat to anyone!!!!
5,Arthritis,"I've been using cosamin DS for many years. It saved my hands from surgery. Amazon offers larger sized bottles, of the capsules, than can be found in the supermarkets and pharmacies. Therefore the cost is something to be desired."
4,What photographs!,Wonderful images and excellent catalogue of Ben Shahn's 1930s photographs.Exhibition currently on display at the Phillips Collection in Washington DC.
1,"Says this is eligible for Prime Shipping, but isn't!","I wanted to order this for my husband and specifically chose this because the description for the product stated it was eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime. When I went to check out however, I was only able to select standard shipping which would have made it arrive too late for my purposes. I called Customer Service, and they said that it could not be shipped using Amazon Prime because the product required ""special handling"". Oh well...."
2,Wrong item,I received the wrong item. I had ordered the 1973 stamps and stories and instead received the 1975 book. Please contact me.
5,In Mirror World everything is backwards,The book is great! You and the twins clean Professor Shock's garage. Then Stacey's ring rolls under the back door where Professor Shock told you not to go. You go into Mirror World and your mission is to get out!
5,Perfect digital camera,"I can not find anything negative to say about this camera. I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim. Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera. Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use. The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera. The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one. You can't go wrong with this camera. Highly recommended."
4,First Digital Camera,"This is the first digital camera I have purchased. I researched diffrent cameras based on quality and price because I was not looking to spend over $325. When I came across this camera(Panasonic DMC-TZ1) I was amazed at all the features the camera had for the price. The 10x zoom is amazing and, while some resolution is sacraficed, you can still take clear pictures with the digital zoom. It has many other features that I have not used yet such as: scene settings(night portrait, night scenery, self portrait,stary sky, fireworks),video recording with sound, and flip animation to name a few. The only problem that I have with this camera is the lack of manual controls. Based on price, quality of pictures, camera weight and overall look and feel; I think that this camera is a good idea if you are: 1) Buying your first digital camera. 2)An amature photographer or new to photography, as it has simple mode and lots of automatic settings. 3)Looking to get the most out of your money."
2,Problem - Lens cap does not attach,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find that the lens cap is a hard, plastic, solid piece that has to be removed each time you use the camera. I knew I would set it down one time, and it would be lost or misplaced (or grabbed and hidden by my twin toddlers). It is a solid piece, without any holes to attach a string. I need a camera where the lens cap either automatically covers the lens when the camera is turned off, or at least can attach easily with a string.Because of this feature alone, I returned the camera. I cannot rate its photo quality."
1,"Unreliable, Very Slow Repair Time","The camera took great pictures in daylight, but had some kind of flash sync problem that resulted in 75% of flash pictures coming out completely dark. Since the problem didn't appear until a month after I purchased the camera I couldn't return it to the store. Panasonic acknowledged the problem and I sent in the camera for repair.The repair will take a full month. They had to order a board from Japan. I find it ridiculous that they have no stock of spare parts in the US.This is my first Panasonic camera and likely my last. I've been very happy with four Sony digital cameras in the past."
4,Time will tell,Update: Works great but don't overfill. It seems a little fragile but you only need to change it every 3 weeks or so. I great buy!I'm trying to use these in leu on penguin size C cartridges. They put so little carbon in the ready made ones they are kind of a ripoff. I got a big jug of marineland carbon and a big sheet of filter floss and plan on using my own next time mine need replacement.
2,56,Only took 20 days and start leaking never again i will buy i will not recommend to any one to purchase some thing this type of pools.
4,pool,Will be best if include filter. Nice product. Safe for children 4 and up with adult supervision. Easy to install
3,Good for Floors,"This vacuum is lightweight, convenient to move around, and nicely designed. It picks-up very well from bare wood and tile floors. However, the suction is not strong enough to clean my low-pile area rugs. I have two cats and a dog so there is dust and pet hair that is easily removed from the floors but not from the rugs. It is still a very worthwhile $37.99 since it is more valuable to use than a regular dustbuster product."
5,Engineering Freshman,The child of a friend needed some help in making decisions for the future and we ordered this book as a gift. It was a big help and had even more information about the engineering field. Great for any college age engineering student.
1,Useful only to those well-versed in discourse analysis,"This book is written in abstruse academese and is a closed loop: terms are defined in the jargon of the field. To an expert in the field, useful, to a novice, incomprehensible. The writing style is dull, opaque, verbose, and redundant. (She constantly says, ""put another way"" and the 'other way' is as incomprehensible as the first way). Also, she misrepresents formal grammar."
1,Review,I am disapointed with this CD. This is not Hawaian! It's more like 50's music. Amazon should not have put this in the Hawaian section.
2,good start,Movie started off great story was thrilling...about half way through took this weird turn into this terrorist's life. I guess they were trying to humanize a cold blooded killer and let you sympathize with his irrational decisions with race and religion...Oh and his undecided relationship with a beautiful but nymph-o girlfriend... Movies overall was gay (weak) and sucked total eggs.
3,Predictable,"Great cast, thin story and very predictable. I don't know why everyone says Ms Rampling is so beautiful, she looks like an owl ready to strike and rip out your throat with those hooded eyes that she can barely see out of.Everyone gets manipulated for use by someone else's agenda and the black and white line between good guys and bad guys is so blurred that it has almost been obliterated."
3,Good but verty forgettable,"Worth a rental. I watched it about a month ago and already have forgotten the plotline....heck, the entire story for that matter.Sean Bean is always a great actor to watch. Can't blame him for an overly famiiar and thus forgettable storyline."
2,Movie Cleanskin,Gave it a try and did not exactly enjoy it. The audio and video was okay and the price was okay.
3,Okay.,It was a good movie and i would probably watch it again to see if I missed anything that was a fairly fast moving plot.
3,Arabic has to be your first language in order to make any use of this book,"Unless Arabic is your first language, this book will not be of much help to you. It is designed exclusively for Arab speakers who have a distinguished command on classical Arabic. This book follows the methods of ancient Arab grammarians who approach language learning as ""nahou"" and ""sarf"". It was printed in Beirut in 1929. Imagine learning a language following the pedagogical methods of the 20s! I personally prefer the book of Thackston better as it follows modern methods of teaching language and thus more efficient. Thackston's book is a lot cheaper and more easy to follow. You will easily notice that page 361 is missing and 366 is printed twice, once after 360 and again where it should fall in proper sequence."
2,It's a Train Going in Circles,"If ever there was a book that started off with so much promise, ""Down There by the Train"" by Kate Sterns is it. To bad that it never delivers. I found it trying way hard to figure out just what kind of book it wanted to be. Ms Sterns use descriptive lines that seem to have come out of those old sixties era detective novels. Than there are phrases and name that seem to be trying to drawn you back to a Victorian time. She has several story lines linked together only by death and the inability to deal with that fate. I found that I couldn't quite learn to like any character due to their lack of true human emotion. In the end you are left with a lot of under developed characters and story lines going no where. It really is too bad, because potential for a great novel is there."
4,Highly Stylized Ophuls,"A deply moving and superbly downbeat tale of a womanslifelongobsession with a pianist. This is the type of film that requires your total attention.The little non dialogue moments are rich and evocative.I think this is one of Louis Jordan,s best roles.When Fontaine realizes that she is not even remembered it reminds me of the devastation of of Geraldine Page in "" Summer and Smoke"" Its not the same but a jolting heart event that will score the emotions of viewers.Wouldnt it have been nice if Ophuls were to continue making films like this one."
4,Obsession in Play,"This downbeat story is not for all tastes, however the acting and direction add the right tecture to the narrative of a woman who has a lifelong absession with a classic painist( Jordan) Max Ophuls directs this very heartfelt story with a striking montage content....so much so that some scenes will remain with the viewer long after the finis."
4,A classic,This is a beautiful story which I had seen a long time ago. There are some films you can enjoy seeing more than once and this is one of them.
4,Slices of real life,"These short historical essays in the graphic/comic form are a fine example of what this medium can do.This is a good access point to a genre of comic books that often gets overlooked - the biography. (Because it's not all superheroes).Collier's clear storytelling and his involvement of personal vignettes in the context of the tales makes them educational and entertaining. Most prominent comparisons in the field would be the DC/Paradox Big Books of ... (Drugs, Crime, Urban Legends). But they have various artists whereas the tales here are united by the author's enthusiasm and interest."
3,Lightweight Little Book,"I think this book is helpful, but too narrow in its focus. I think it could be seriously expanded on to include family and friends too, not just business social situations which seems to be the focus.The type is set wide so they could fill pages on this one. Still a good start on the subject, but I would try something else if I was only to buy one book on the subject."
5,A must read for relational success!,"This is a must read for everyone who talks to anyone! It is well written, easy to read and very practical. As a writer and speaker, it has helped me in getting to the ""big talk"" with clients. I've highly recommended it to friends and continue to use it as a resource."
3,"Motivational, but not sure it helped me","In listening to the tapes I was thinking to myself that Debra made a lot of sense and offered some good advice. She is also pleasant to listen to, as far as a tape on small talk goes. Once you actually try to apply the tips she gives you though, it is a whole other story. I find it very akward to say things like, ""Really, and how did that affect you?"" Or, ""Tell me about your family."" to strangers. I mean, who says that? lolThere are some little tips on information collecting that proved useful, but some of her actual ""conversation starters"" I fear I won't be using.Worth listening to for the price... maybe try to borrow it from a friend though first. :)"
1,Saw her on a morning show,"I saw this author on Today/Good Morning America. She was promoting her new book, that came out in December. Maybe I shouldn't review this book, since I haven't actually read it, but her advice on television was ridiculous!!!!!! She was talking about striking up conversations with people at Christmas parties. I would feel like an idiot bringing up the topics of conversation she suggested. I hate being mean, but I just don't get how this lady is a best seller of books on improving social skills! The only book I've read on the subject is 92 little tricks for big success in relationships (I think that's the name) By Leil Lowndes (something like that) Her suggestions have helped me a lot!!!!"
5,A True Gem,"The best recording of Turandot. Better than her 1959 recording with Bjoerling. Her effortless high notes over chorus and orchestra at the end of the second act are beyond compare. Corelli, when he was in voice was superb. He is in voice."
4,Tangled Destinies,"The back cover reads:""He was a stranger from the wrong side of town. First he'd saved Gabrielle Bennett's life. Then he'd taken possession of her very soul. She'd been so young but had quickly come to love Marc Stephano with all her heart. Until he had betrayed her. Now, at twenty-six, she was a success in New York's modeling world. Once she would have sacrificed every advantage for the poor boy who'd awakened her. Now she stood face-to-face with the rich, powerful man Marc had become. In spite of herself he possessed her again. But what did she want--to avenge the past or risk the sweet, dangerous passion he offered, a passion that would bind their destinies forever?"""
3,"solid, not spectacular","The story starts off with free-lance journalist Bailey Weggins being called by her boss to investigate her nanny not answering a call, when they find a dead body. Even though she's a writer and not a cop, Bailey is given the task of investigating this murder. Bailey's character to me was much more style than substance. She's too cool, too sassy, and not much like a real person. Her relationships in this story fell flat and did not remotely interest me. It seemed as if they were there just so she could have love interests, but like her character had little substance to it.The murder investigation had some good twists and turns to it, but in the end became a little predictable. At times it felt the misdirection was forced, but at least the logical progression of the story made sense. The story moved at a good pace. There was enough going on to keep it interesting, but there wasn't enough to really sink your teeth into.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
1,I Should Have Known Better...,"What was I thinking, buying a book on the advice of Hayley Chandler? This book could not be more boring...and do not get me started on the horrific writing style- so amateur hour. Nothing rings true about these characters-for crying out loud, I have a Labrador named Bailey!!I am so sorry I spent money on this disaster- I could not even bring myself to finish it. It is sitting in the corner of my den where I tossed it four days ago.Do not believe the hype- this book is banal. Period."
4,Fun Mystery,"This book was fun to read. I usually don't read mysteries, but this one is entertaining. It kept me guessing who the killer was until the end."
2,Good Story;Not So-Good-Reader,"Though Kate White's storyline could definately hold the listener's attention, the reader, Parker Posey, could not have been a worse choice. I found myself focusing on her lack of energy and inappropriate inflection rather than on the story. Though I look forward to more books from White, for me they will have to be in print or with another reader."
1,I have nothing nice to say,"I wasn't going to write a review until I read what the others had written. But, I have to say that this book was SO boring. The end was so lame that I was mad when I read it. This is one of those books where you can skip entire chapters and only miss what she had for breakfast. I am thinking of throwing this book away to save the next unsuspecting victim. This book had to much drivel and not enough meat, which is too bad. The initial concept reeled me in."
2,A Page Turner It Wasn't,"I was looking for a new mystery writer, having read all of Patricia Cornwell, many Dean Koontz books, recently Harlan Coban and the standby Richard North Patterson. Kate White took forever to stretch this book out, often repeating the same descriptive phrases and recounting the same details. I really can't say I even enjoyed it and it was a chore to finish."
5,Superb Thriller,"I LOVE Gennita Low's books. They are full of intrigue, espionage, romance and kickass heroes AND heroines. In Gennita's world, the heroines are fully capable spies who fight right next to the hero. No damsel in distress required! This book is a re-issue of an earlier book, although there are additional scenes included that do not alter or affect the original story. It is still as compelling as when originally published."
3,Disappointing,The book had a good plot that should have been good but it was very slow moving. I finally read the end to see how it ended up and then tossed it.
1,A line for freedom - reprogramming your kids!,"Lynne does an excellent job affixing the white ruling class idelogy for your guppy children to soak up and defend. Too bad she doesn't plan to share the bounty stolen by her supremist perspective. There are much better ways to fill your children with wonder and optimism than to indocrinate them with one-sided vitrol wrapped in warmly illustrated fantasy art.People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present (P.S.)Theres a reason it sells for 96% off every day- propaganda is never expensive, you get what you pay for... unless your a robber barron's wife!"
1,Eye candy and weak on history,"I didn't read the entire book, simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore. However, it doesn't take much more than 20 min to get through it. The book is nothing but a timeline of miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency. Each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences. You might learn some trivia going through it but not much else. It is also not a very objective view of US history - not a single ""factoid"" given for the 8 years of the Clinton presidency was positive, only negatives."
5,Perhaps one of the Greatest Comedies Of All Time.,"Some of the reviewers here who hated ""Happiness"" seem to suggest that that they are not 'uptight, conservative or nave'.. Well this movie was truly about them; their denial and their failure of autonomous cognition as psuedo-moralistic sheep of society.Thank god that a lot of people don't get this movie. This movie was made to alienate and subjugate mediocre americana.""Happiness"" is a 'top-ten' cult classic and will stay that way for a long while. This is absolutely one of the most scandalous and devious comedies of all time, reminiscent of early John Waters but less-overt and more psychological. Brilliant in its subtlety within a perversion of american ethics du jour and one of the best comedies ever made."
3,NC-17 and why?,"First off let's ask the question why NC-17? I can understand why this is NOT for children and your bible thumping do-gooders but, to give it a NC-17 is very misleading. NOTE: THERE IS NO CHILD MOLESTATION VISUALS (this was the vague reviews and misleading rating that made me hesitant to watch it in the first place).Having already watched Solondz previous film WELCOME TO THE DOLL HOUSE, I already had a taste of his style. I won't explain the plot because it already has been done, plus I'm too lazy. Although the movie wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be it's worth watching. But to clearify things for those who think it may be to visauly taboo for there taste, it's really not. the NC-17 was probably given for the subject matter and not it's visuals."
4,Petroleum-dark vision on seeking happiness - a must see,"If you look at things open-mindedly and like to think for your own... then you just MIGHT like this movie. Take the chance - at least you'll be mind-moved.Nothing is explicitly terrible here - it's all what is implied what shocks and amazes because of the sarcastic situations. In the end, these pretty, successful, perfect characters still carry the same desperate soul looking for happiness of their misfit relatives - yet end up being bitter and way more unbearable. Memorable Jane Adams and Lara Flynn Boyle - you just can't help loving the first and hating the second. And if you find yourself laughing or feeling sorry while thinking 'how terrible this is', you'll understand the greatness of the ...story.PS: Just 4 stars: because there is still 'Magnolia' - another great interpretation by Philip Seymour Hoffman , by the way.."
2,American Beauty meets Magnolia,"This movie is a dull crossbreed between Magnolia and American Beauty, two great movies. Unfortunately, the movie is way to long, and is felt through the minutes of footage that didn't need to be there. About every 4 minutes something exciting and funny would happen, so you feel yourself hanging on to this 2hour+ movie waiting for the next explosion, which should happen more frequently."
1,No happiness here... just bordeom & sleepiness,This DVD was almost unbearable to watch... what a disappointment... and I did love Welcome to the Dollhouse... but this movie was horrid.This DVD ruined my Saturday evening... I could have watched something a lot more enjoyable... I practically had to hold my eyeballs open to get to the end....MY ADVICE::: Watch something else instead.
1,A waste of effort from a good director,"This movie is nothing short of disturbing. While I found the direction to be excellent, one has to ask his/herself whether they wish to be lead down the path of disgust. I managed to make it through the whole movie but felt slightly sick afterwards. I felt myself wondering if it was worth it after 2 hours of delving into the torturous lives of a few very messed-up people. A few tidbits of positivity would have gone a long way in this film. instead we get cynicism at it's peak."
4,The real slim shady,"This is good for Em, I like this better than his new efforts like ""Encore"" and ""Eminem Show"" most of this is good, i haven't heard every song though, like ""drug ballad"" ""Amityville"" ""Kim""""Marshall Mathers"" ""Criminal"" and ""KIm"" cause it was taped for me by one of my friendz and them tracks wasnt on it, anywayz the standout tarcks are ""kill You"" ""stan"" ""remember me?"" ""Real Slim Shady"" and ""Under the Influence"" with D12. Not as good as Slim Shady LP but still tight.And thats all I have to say about that"
4,well it'll do!,"I don't realy have much to say about this cd, it's the best rap cd ever if you like that stuff, my personal fav. is The way I am. Because it rocks and Marilyn Manson appears on the video wich makes the song 100x better and it was good to start with. Eminems best work ever."
5,"Just L!ke Dre, Em !$ B@ck @g@!n","I got this album the minute it got to Grenada and there were only one disappointment, which was it should of gotten here sooner. Em's still the same craaazy a$$ dude but with one difference, he's MUCH BETTER! It's hard to top a triple platinum album, especially a debut album but he surly did it with this joint. With the best producer by his side being no other than the doctor himself Dr. Dre it'll be very hard for Em to drop. This isn't white hype or the white hope, Em is a bad a$$ rapper so this album is for all U rap fans. Add this to UR collection."
3,Ups and Downs,"I hate to say it, but out of his pre-""Show"" albums, the MM LP is his least interesting. Sure, songs like ""Criminal"", ""Who Knew"", and ""The Real Slim Shady"" are strong outings, but a lot of the songs just left me scratching my head. It's a hard album to grade, I would give a 3.5 if I could, but it's not like this album is lacking for praise. Also, this may sound like I'm contradicting my previous statements, but ""Stan"" is the best song that Eminem has ever written."
4,Stomach churning skit,"The Ken Kaniff skit was just plain descusting it'll giva ya nightmares. But, the rest of the cd was good!"
2,Bad cd,"Eminem is the worst rapper that ive ever heard, he has no flow at all amd the only reason he has any popularity at all is production. Nice hooks, sometimes a few lines of good rap, but overall it just another example of how bad music can be popular if the artist is liked."
3,"This isn't his second album, you toys.","Dude, I wonder why they only play white rappers on the rock stations."
1,Nothing Special,Eminem is Good for a Laugh I'll Give Him that&the Dissing was On Point at Certain Artists.The Music&Production is ALright.but Overall it's One Big Joke.He is Mainly Around For Shock Value which gets old Pretty fast.I Really Dug The Real Slim Shady but I Don't really feel the other Tracks.
4,"Harsh, very harsh","I was a bit skeptical of this followup, but when I popped it in I wasn't let down at all. He sure hasn't toned down, that's for sure. The only problem I got is all the lashing out on this album is a way more venomous on this one than it was on Slim Shady. But anyways... the best cuts here have gotta be Stan, Kim, Drug Ballad, and The Way I Am. Stan is definitely the most haunting track I've heard, and Kim is hands down the most chilling. Don't trust anyone who has a chuckle at either of them, and that's all that's left to say."
5,"A Dark, Noir Classic","Whereas Eminem's first popular release, ""The Slim Shady LP,"" ... was the apathetic man's anthem, ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" is a departure from this theme. This album is Eminem defending himself from critics that attacked ""The Slim Shady LP"" for its lyrics.""The Marshall Mathers LP"" is a dark reflection of the conflicting forces of good and evil going in within the mind of Marshall Mathers. Most of the beats are solid, and the lyrics are at once obscene, funny, and clever. We'd expect no less from Eminem.The best songs are: Kill You, Who Knew, Remember Me, I'm Back, B!tch Please II, and Under the Influence."
3,good but bad,"it is clear that eminem is one fo the best lyricists of his time on this album but if you listen to them there isn't a hell of a lot of meaning to his songs. some songs are very good like stan, kim, criminal, who knew, and remember me. but many others just dont have anything to them. i still listen to them for the same reason i listen to someone like nelly. they sound good and are alrgiht for listenin when driving around or whatever. but if you want somethin to actually listen to deeply this isnt it. the slim shady lp was one of the better cd's i have heard in a long time but he dropped off with this album. eminem needs to get back to his underground style more and back to when he had somethin to say. his next album is supposed to be more story tellin and hopefully better. thats it i'm out."
5,The one and only,"Eminem is one of the few great rappers of our time. He is original in his lyrics and this is very refreshing. He raps about what he is feeling and doesn't care what anyone says about it. Although no one wants to admit it, everyone has felt like him at one time or another. He, and only he, has the balls to say it out loud and I respect him for that."
1,This is the worst cd i have ever heard.,This cd was so offensive to the beautiful Christina agulara and to his wife kim and women and gay men it makes me wish i didn't buy it. The only good song on there is stan... But that isn't that good so if your out there and thinking of not buying it don't bother.
5,Eminem is Hot!,"I love this cd! It is so great,all the songs rock.My favorite is ""kill you"". He puts great effort into his music. It just ROCKS every one totally needs 2 buy this cd, its the best!"
4,Pretty good!,"I have had this CD for the longest time...its a MUST BUY! If you like rap, or even Eminem, buy this cd! My favorite songs are Marshall Mathers and Criminal...the lyrics are just so insane! You should listen to this cd (see above) and then buy it. Im telling you, this is a great work of art!"
4,"Good, but old.","I like his stuff. He has very creative rhymes, and an original style. However, I don't like it when musical artist sing about other famous people. Ok, so you know Dr. Dre, Fred Durst, Carson Daily, Christina Aguilera and every other person in the world. Bid deal. His songs are not very deep either. But I still like em for some twisted reason. Sadistic I guess."
5,Eminem is extraordinary,"This album is by far the best I've heard. I just want to say to all those who get offended by it then put ear plugs on, Eminem is real and he tells it like it is. He lets out his anger and frustration in a song which is better then taking drugs when you're upset. Well, for those of you who don't have it, you should go out and buy it. Eminem is PHENOMENAL!"
3,It's and alright LP,"I think this LP is a little better than his first but not much. It is very similar in ways how he talks about killing everybody and thats about all he talks about. If you liked his first LP you will really like this one, I'm just not the biggest fan."
5,The Real Slim Shady,"This is just quite simply one of the best rap albums I have heard next to All Eyez On Me and Doggystyle. Em's style has really matured since his last album and is now very distinctive. Lyrically the album is superb but the delivery is also faultless.Perhaps the ultimate compliment though is that he outshines all of his guests on the album and, when you consider that they include Dre, Snoop and Xzibit, that is not easy.The tracks of real distinction are The Real Slim Shady, Stan, Marshall Mathers, B-Please 2, and Under The Influence with the D-12, who also come off well.All in all, this is one of the albums of the year and no rap fan, or fan of good music, should be without it."
2,"Eminem preaches togetherness, tolerance","On his ""Marshall Mathers LP"" Eminem implores listeners to ""love one another, sister and brother"" and cherish our differences rather than let them lead to hatred and prejudice. ""Don't need no hate, love is my fate"" he raps in the tender ballad ""Kim"". He also makes a bold statement in support of gays and lesbians by defiantly rapping ""I'm Eminem and I'm here to say, I love you whether you're straight or gay."" Other controversial topics Em weighs in on include the environment, euthenasia, capital punishment, affirmative action, the tension in the middle east and racial profiling. Em's message throughout seems to be ""let's heal the wounds of the past and work on making the future a little brighter for our children"". Soldier on, Em!"
3,This White Boy Can Rap!,"You gotta love it. . .Eminem actually rhymes about things that are important in today's society. The lyrics are unbelievable, and better yet, undertandable. Good Cd, but it could use some more A-class songs."
2,Expected better,"I heard this CD when it first came out, and was... well, disturbed. If you thought his first album was bad, wait till you get a load of this. However it is not without its merits. ""Stan"" is a pretty good song. For all those who got a kick out of his previous album, this one is for you. For the more sane among us, I suggest you skip this CD and purchase something not quite so... weird."
2,Waste of money,"Unlike Dropping in on Matisse, Dropping in on Picasso spends more time analyzing the artist's work (which is actually the best part of the film) and also his biogaphy, but like the former, there are way too little insight of his works. A lot of his famous paintings (Where was Guernica? Jeez...) are sorely not covered in the film which runs for measly 20 minutes. The price of the movie absolutely isn't justified. Also, I give the film points off for not being cubism. It's just ironic that it is an animated film that is covering cubism yet isn't cubism itself. All in all, Dropping in on Picasso is a serious waste of money."
5,GREAT BAIT,I LOVE ZOOM! AND THE BABY BRUSH HOG IS THE WAY TO GO ALL 4 SEASONS! AND THIS COLOR WATERMELLON RED & CHART. ARE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,ha ha ha ha,"This makes me laugh. First, because the show is so ungodly terrible, and second because the DVD gives you only the English dubbed censored version. That just makes me crack up, especially since most viewers are ages 6-12 who believe themselves to be cool watching a show that has violence. The funniest thing about it is that some of them are actually under the impression that Dragonball Z is an adult show. Message to any and all children who believe they are watching an adult series: Dragonball Z is not nor has it ever been intended for adults. In Japan it is enjoyed by little children no different than yourselves except that they get to enjoy the completely uncensored versions of these episodes. So if you're upset that they edited all profanity, blood and similar content, don't worry. It's a show for little kids one way or the other."
5,This book just keeps getting better,"very very goog,this edition includes more color plates. These figures are especially important to such a visual discipline in microbiology,in bacteriology is excelent, VOLUME1:Bacteriology!!! and VOLUME2: Virology , Mycology, Parasitology"
5,Love it!,This is my favorite perfume! I always get compliments on it! And I got a great deal on this purchase!
1,"Doesn't work, no support available","Using a Pro Clear 250 on a 125 reef tank. While dirty foam is collecting inside the column, the pump does not seem to have enough ""oomph"" to push the foam up into the collection cup. Its been running for three weeks. Have tried every combination of water level and air intake. Best foam created with air intake valve removed (wide open air intake), and deepest possible sump water level, and water column pipe raised to highest level. Water temp is 80 degrees, specific gravity of 1.026. This is going back to the retailor-- if they'll take it."
3,Non-Fiction,"An introductory type of palaeontology book, aimed at younger readers in general.This first volume goes from the start of life until the time of the dinosaurs, which, of course, is the really cool part that everyone likes the most."
1,A Rewriter of His - Story Tries to Rewrite Hers,"You have probably already read the review, which I disagree with, so I won't bore you with another review. But I would ask you to read this book with a very critical eye because Dick Morris telling Hillary CLinton's story is about as credible as Monica Lewinsky telling Hillary's story.He was Bill's friend and confidant, and like Bill, had affairs (most notable was when he was caught by a photographer enflagrante delicto with his mistress on the roof of the Jefferson Hotel in DC having breakfast in his bathrobe). How anyone could believe that his insights are credible escapes me?Hate Hillary if you chose, but do so for your own reasons, not based on the beliefs and musings of a man who made his money advising Bill Clinton on how you lie to the American people. This same man (?) now needs to destroy the reputation of his former client's wife to make a buck! Talk about your quintessential media --ore!Caveat emptor!"
1,Could Dick Be Bitter?,"Read about this author, learn where he has been and what he's done. Discover why the Clinton's had to fire him. It was pretty sensational, with journalists galore salivating over the prospect of ""outing him"". Even so, the Clintons tried to save him from ignominy."
1,Lying liar telling lies,"In an unintended Freudian slip Morris boasted on Hannity & Colmes that his book contains ""a hundred and eight-six distortions, omissions, exaggerations or lies."" Indeed!!Anyone thinking of taking this political diatribe seriously should take a look at the detailed exposure of the contradictions and falsehoods in this book posted on the web site of Media Matters."
3,Not much of an expose,I can't say that Morrie trod much new ground here. Most of the information and ancdotes here have been reported all over internet news sites for years.I'd have to say that the book is rather lame and uninteresting especially as another reviewer pointed out from an insider perspective. I would have expected much much more and Hillary Clinton lover or hate her should have had elicted many many more interesting stories than this sad little tome. I am sure Mr's Clinton is a lot more interesting than the author made her out to be - be that good or bad.
1,Interesting but Meaningless,"This book is not unlike Don Regan's 'For the Record' about his years with Ronald Reagan. Like Regan, Morris had worked closely with the first family, and like Regan, it ended badly for him. So, what did he go? He went and wrote a mean spirited book about the people who made his name famous.Morris' book is so vindictive and meanspirited that it obscures some real concerns about the person of Hillary Clinton. He sees everything about her in a bad way, and I can only conclude that the Clinton's snubbing of Morris is the cause of this.Yes, Morris was an advisor to the Clintons at various times of their career, but so were a lot of people. It doesn't make him an expert on Hillary Clinton and his analysis is most definately not the final word.Dissapointingly short, this book is printed in large font with double spacing. A good short in flight read that should be taken as seriously as a tabloid rag."
3,a grudge,"Dick Morris is not a nice man who dis's a woman who is not very nice, either. They don't like each other and haven't for years . . . .He makes some good points that are worth reviewing because Hillary will be our next president....for good or bad. I find it particularly irritating that he focuses so much attention on her re-making her image, physical and otherwise. . . . we all know this....we watched her do it! The more interesting places in the book have to do with personal information he has after spending so much time with the Clintons. Now the reader just has to decide whether or not to believe him......but when you think/talk about the Clintons, who do you believe? The characters they choose/chose for their company were no more appealing than the Clintons, themselves!"
1,Dick Morris- degenerate,"Just a reminder that this guy cheated on his wife around the same time Clinton was being pounded for his indiscretions.Sean Hannity, early in his book ""Let Freedom Ring"" reminded us of how Bill Clinton tainted the office of the presidency and then not two paragraphs later noted how Morris was a good friend of his (Hannity's) and then led into negative opinions on Morris of Clinton. Didn't bother to mention anything about Morris doing the exact same thing- and this little worm woulda lied with his palm on the Ark of the Covenant so don't give me (...) about the lame@ss lying under oath Republican punk. (...) hyprocrite!"
1,"Lies, Lies and more lies","This book is a complete lie and has no basis for its so-called facts. If you want the truth, listen to Air American Radio. Go to Airamericaradio.com and you can stream the audio if you do not have an affiliate. This is where the truth is! Time for a change in this country, and it seems like Dick Morris is trying to make issues of something that people don't care about."
1,nothing but lies!,"this book is full of nothing but lies. You can't trust Dick Morris any more than you can trust the likes of Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh. No facts in this book, just bogus material."
2,doberman gang posters,"well, i am glad i have 1, being a doberman freak, but...i didnt look close to the details b4 i purchased it. i do believe this was someones old/worn poster that was copied & redistributed. You can see old yellowed tape marks, & other imperfections indicating my ""opinion"". that was my bad for not paying attention to detail! once i compared what i received to the enlarged poster on site it was exact...w/that said once in a good frame & up on the wall it looks great. only i know its not perfect!"
2,"The ""Forever"" is Appropriate","Forever is exactly how long this book seems to last. It is the tale of the beautiful and ambitious Amber, who sleeps her way to the top of Restoration society in London. Amber lives through husbands, lovers, plague, fire, etc; but she never seems to grow up and does not change. (Even the oblivious Scarlett O'Hara had an epiphany at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND) I could not identify with any of the unlikable characters, and did I mention that the main character, Amber, learned nothing in her journey? Look for my copy at your local Goodwill store."
4,Cut off pages in Kindle version,The kindle version is not perfect. The last and sometimes first sentence was cut off of the page. The novel is a must read. BOoooooo Kindle! Fix this please.
1,Period piece indeed,The subplot that revolves around the king was useless and boring. This book was 700 pages too long. Do not recommend if you are a plot rather than character related person.
5,REFRESHING! a chilled glass of water for the whole family!!,You are going to enjoy this creative devotional for the whole family.
3,Poor quality picture of a good film.,"This Laserlight version of this very good film is terrible with a very poor picture and sound.I would recommend buying the Carlton(the silver collection)version of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""(1934)from Amazon UK.This British DVD version(region 2) has a very good picture and sound and this Hitchcock fan was very happy to buy it."
1,Hugely terrible and terribly huge.,"This is literally the biggest bluetooth headset I have seen in my life.The part that wraps around your ear doesn't rotate to adjust the angle of the headset, which makes it very uncomfortable if the earpice doesn't fit perfectly into your ear. It is attached using cheap flimsy plastic and a spring that will easily break.On that note, I thought that the earpiece was similar to that of a plantronics, with a rubber earpiece that goes into your ear. This is just a painfully hard plastic one.Button locations are very inconvenient and hard to press as well. The answer button is on the bottom when it's on your right ear and on the top when it's on your left making it confusing if you switch often. Similarly, the volume buttons are only in their logical places when the headset is on the left ear.Sound quality is terrible at high volumes and mediocre at best when low.Overall piece of junk. Very glad that I only paid $3 for it on a one-deal-per-day website."
1,No Vista,Never used the book-removed Vista from machine and reinstalled XP. Vista was a bad product.
4,A must have,"First of all, if you don't know what the Darwin Awards are, then you're looking at the wrong book. Go back and buy the first one. NOW. If you've already dont that, then get this. you won't regret it. A collection of short (and some long) stories of people who are the living proof that someone up there has a sense of humor. But this isn't for everyone. If your squemish at every little drop of blood (or, perhaps, someone having a rusty pipe shoved at their groin...) then you should really turn back now. Some, if not most, of these stories involve rather greusome deaths or losses or reproductive organs (males only). But, all in all, a great read."
2,"Rehashed, unrewarding","This ""second"" edition contains several ""classic"" Darwin selections from the first book. There are a few good, new pieces in here, but mostly this book's a waste of time. Strictly a bathroom book."
2,Good product. Way too expensive,"You are much better off buying this locally. Walgreens is substantially cheaper. I haven't looked elsewhere, but would guess Wal Mart is an even better deal if they carry it."
3,inexpensive experienced guide,"The good doctor has written an informative book for those of us just exploring the idea of plasticsurgery. While his guide is well written and concise, I was hoping for a bit more expansive help.I would recommend this inexpensive book as a good starting point for anyone interested in what plastic surgery can and can not do."
1,msiguided auther,well I have read the book but it did not offer any new information that any consumer could get from Operah. Too simple to be written by a doctor and it does not offer anything beyond common knowlege that is avialable every where. one interesting thing is in chapter 9 where Kotler gives a personal opinion as a scientific fact but the truth is actually the opposite.[...]
3,WARNING!!! Do not order these in the Summer!!!,"Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer. No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo! The entire bag was liquid when I received it. I love Haribo gummies, but will not order them in the summer ever again. They were shipped with expedited shipping."
1,I don't think so,I purchased these hoping they would taste as good as some made in indiana. I was wrong they smell funny and taste even worse.
1,If you live in a house where everyone eats up all the candy...,"Then this is the gummy candy just for you. Your kids won't touch it. Don't even offer any to them, they'll just spit the first piece right out.Did someone say these taste like a flat cola? Yeah, a cheap supermarket brand that's been left open on a window sill, in the sun, for two weeks.The Gold Bears are super to leave on a positive note."
3,Manfred Symphony,"I find Previn's Manfred to be a bit lackluster. My favorite is the Maazel on Decca. It's beautifully recorded, with powerful brass and percussion. Unfortunately, it's out of print."
2,My head hurts,"Str8 Young Gangstaz 4 Christ (Grapetree, 1999)Production: Big Tone/ A.K.G./ Kenny SmithI like Rap. I respect the art form. But I can't get with everybody. Not to say that this isn't a good project, it's just not in heavy rotation at my crib.The Gangstaz have that same vibe that you get with Cats like SNOOP & DRE and will appeal to that crowd. But if you're into that Freedom Of Soul or GRITS/ Jazzy Rap vibe, this ""Chronic"" flavored joint will to start to get on your nerves.Made up of a youth director, an ex gangbanger and a minster, this group comes hard --like a DOGG POUND album-- which is too hard for me. But maybe you'll like it.Picks: You're Always/ Move Tha CrowdLaZeric Fridell Freeman"
4,A LITTLE BIT OF THIS AND THAT...,"This is an excellent compilation of the author's short stories, which were written between 1969 and 1987. The author, who has since gone on to fame and fortune, having written a number of best sellers, among them ""The Tomb"", ""The Touch"", and ""The Keep"", writes a brief, yet interesting, introduction to each of the sixteen stories, telling the reader the genesis and history of each one.The stories range from the macabre to the odd, with unexpected twists and turns. These can be categorized as being of the horror genre of fiction. The book also features some stories that fall squarely into the science fiction genre. No matter the genre, they are all edgy, clever, and clearly a labor of love by the author. For those unfamiliar with the work of the author, this is an excellent introduction, as these brief, well written stories will give the reader a thirst for more."
5,"Rich, spicy sex bomb!!","This is the perfect cool-weather sex bomb!! I absolutely LOVE this scent, and I can't believe how dead sexy it is!! I catch myself wondering ""mmm, what smells so good?"" and it's ME!! This is pheromone-free (unless you choose to add pheros) but you'd never know it - it attracts like nothing else!! I will never let myself run out of this!!"
3,Maggie has her eye on Joe,"Burke Devlin makes an offer to Elizabeth Collins Stoddard to buy Collinwood, much to the surprise of...well, pretty much everyone. This changes Carolyn's mind about the man, but not David's. Roger continues to search for the missing pen, a clue which might lead to more questions about Bill Malloy's death.As you might guess from the cover, one of the highlights of this week's worth of episodes is Maggie and Joe having a dance at the Blue Whale. Audiences who like Mr. Haskell have put up with 15 weeks of his mistreatment by Carolyn Stoddard, and were probably relieved to see Maggie admit to her father that she has something of a crush on Joe."
1,MORE BARK THAN BITE!,No Vampire though: - Just the standard insane doctor running the prison with lots of inmates just awaitin' to be experimented upon. Well beneath the dignity of the Great Sir Donald Wolfit as the maddie - nasty moments in the lab and with the guard dogs .........A guilty treasure....
2,The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash doesn't lather as ...,"The Dove Ultra-Moisturizing Body Wash doesn't lather as well as most other body washes on the market. It claims to moisturize your skin, but I couldn't tell any difference with my skin after using it. I found the scent unattractive as well."
5,The Illustrated Great Controversy,"Overall well written.I might not agree with some things the author has written,but this is very well done.Starting with Jesus shortly before the end of his ministry on earth,the book chronicles church history accurately and in an interesting fashion,then the text proceeds to cover prophecy in a historical context with what many founding denominational leaders had to say (as is commonly noted,history repeats itself)which is quite unlike what is believed in many christian circles today.The photos add an extra dimension that anyone with an open mind will find damning evidence.Thought provoking indeed."
3,"Works great, but too small","Looks nice, works great, but was too small for our needs. A 12 oz can of coffee and a small scoop fit, but it's so close to the top that the beans fall out when we are scooping them out. We have dogs and coffee beans on the floor? I don't even want to know what my dogs on coffee beans would be like!"
3,Some reservations about this book,"I love Lidia and love her style of cooking. This was her first book and therein lies the rub. I found this book almost inpenetrable. Great stories about her childhood in Istria, but the recipes are almost universally unusable. Octopus salad, cuttlefish sacs, etc. Not the kind of thing you'd be inclined to try in your own kitchen. Lidia is very bright, that much is obvious. But I think she'd tried too hard to impress us with her intellect. I'd try another of her titles, if I were you."
2,"The manual is incomplete, almost useless.","I was using [Andale] and also tried auctionworks to post and manage my auctions, they were great and very simple to use, but you have to pay a monthly fee, so I decided to switch to this program. The features seem great, but I can't make it work. You have to have your own web site, free or paid, to upload the auction you create with this software, to [an auction website]. To this moment, I have checked the manual several times, and don't understand how to do it. The website is useless. I'm going to try with email support, but it is not the way it should work. The software assumes that the user knows how to set a website, and how to do a lot of things before making this thing work. In the end, I think that the program could be great if it were more easy to setup.UPDATE TO DECEMBER 11th 2003I downgraded my rating, because, three weeks has passed, and still I can't make it work. I returned to the paying auction utilities site."
3,Sweet Courreges by Courreges for Women,I was disappointed with the product. I wasn't that happy at all with my purchase. I have Empriente by Courreges that I first bought in Paris. Now that's an excellent fragrance.
5,POWERful Album!,"I already had the original Power album, and it is GREAT! This version, an import from Japan is 100 times BETTER! Not included in this version are the three mixes (Pray for Love club mix, The Power Spiced Mix, and Absolutely Everybody Latino mix). NEW for this album are the songs STEAM (previously only available on a b-side CD Single) in which Vanessa really shines (No pun intended!), the very bouncy Turn To Me, and two Bonus Tracks. The first, Rise Up will have you singing along in no time. They saved the best for last with Second Chance, which has become my second favorite song (SHINE, of course is my favorite!). This Import is WORTH THE MONEY, BUY IT NOW!"
4,"Overall, I thought the Camay Softly Scented Bath ...","Overall, I thought the Camay Softly Scented Bath Bar was a very good product. It lathered well and left my skin feeling soft. The only thing I didn't like was the fragrance. Even though it's supposed to be """"softly scented,"""" I found it to be a little too strong. The strong scent is only from the bar of soap, it doesn't linger on your skin, but it was more than I expected while showering. Other than that, it's a product I would buy again."
4,Love the Trays,"I purchased these trays for avid Domino players, they loved the trays they received for a Christmas Gift. I would recommend purchasing the stands only if whoever your buying them for LOVES TO PLAY, Domino's"
4,Practical,"I bought these as a gift. I didn't inspect them much before I wrapped them up, but they looked pretty good. I did notice a few spots on the wood that could maybe use a little sanding, but probably running the dominoes in the groove would smooth things over."
2,Domino tray,"I selected these trays as they had free shipping, but they are really too small to use with Mexican Train dominoes and be able to easily view the dominoes. The trays also have a rather unpleasant odor."
2,Get group fun,"Found that we couldn't use these boards for the dominos could see both side if put in up right and laying down was to hard to read and see. Sorry, will not be able to use this stand for this Amazon game of Mexican Train."
4,Nice but not big enough,"These are very nice wooden trays but I have the 1/2"" size dominoes and they do not fit in these trays. They hold only the 3/8"" tiles."
2,Not as functional as anticipated,"Although we thought this was a necessary item for the Mexican Train game, it isn't ! The trays are awkward. The tiles fall out of them all the time (funny angle). Once the tiles are placed, you really can't see the numbers. We actually tried the trays once and put them away. We much prefer lining them up on the table. That works much better."
5,Sonic Youth,"Well, some people will find this album a litle strange but if SY isn't about music experimentation i don't know who is. This is for real SY fans or music lovers."
4,"Not pop, thank goodness","This album is worth buying for Kim Gordon's trumpet playing alone! Her style on the horn owes alot to her vocal method: calm, world-weary and quietly amused. That's how it sounds to me, anyways. Jim O'Rourke also plays on the record, and his presence lends it a few more non-guitar sounds than are heard on the other early SYRs--and with that a bit less guitar sound--but especially on the third track the electronics blend wonderfully with what the other Sonics are doing. Note: this isn't really a pop record, and if you expect it to be you'll probably be disappointed. But if you're in the mood for 50 minutes of beautiful sounds and slow yet inevitable development, this is the record for you. And it rocks quite a bit towards the end, too."
2,ALL-NIGHT PARTY,"All-Night Party by R.L. Stine may look good and scary, but don'texpect very much from this book. It's about a group of friendswho get together on Fear Island in a cabin for a friend's birthday.After the friend is murdered, the group begins to suspect eachother,and a escaped killer. This book isn't as good as it looks, thoughit has some scary parts. Stine could have done much better withthis book and made it as good as some of his others (The Babysitter series)."
3,"Twisted plot, yet not what you expected.","I don't think this is one of his good books, he normally doesn't have things so simple. There more complex. Grechen finds everything and over hears everything it's like shes the killer!(Shes not) It must just be one of those practise books so he had enough money so he can come out w/his Fear Street Saga's and they be like beautiful plots and everything. I've been reading R.L. Stine since Welcome to Dead House Goosebumps #1. I have all of the Goosebumps. I'm not reading his Ultimate or 2000 Goosebump thing. WRITE ON R.L.!!!!"
2,Oh Cracker Where has your Talent Gone!,"After a few different music projects (countrysides, oh brother, Live!) I personally was looking forward to Crackers new release Greenland.However this album in a nutshell is dry and weak. There are no catchy tunes like in the past. The single ""Something you aint got"" is strong, as is ""everybody gets one for free"". The rest of album lacks something. Its full of repetitive choruses, and weak guitar riffs.Countrysides was great, and I dont like country at all. Their last studio album ""Forever"" was great too with a strong mix of rockers, ballads, and dance numbers.OVERALL A DISSAPOINTED CRACKER FAN!"
5,Maybe my favorite Cracker Album,"From their alt-country to edgier rock tracks, this album sounds like a mature version of their early work. Nothing sounds like it was thrown on here to appease the radio crowd. The dark heavier sounds of Sidi Ifni and The Minotaur contrast perfectly with Where Have the Good Times Gone and Darling We're Out of Time. And after seeing them live The Riverside earns new respect. If you like Cracker, and crave a more mature sound, this album is definitely for you!"
2,"Not for the serious traveller, or any traveller","Compared to other Route 66 books, this one rates far below them. I can appreciate the love for the mother road in it, but there's too much fluff. I don't care about what songs the author recommends, or the cars. There's also some glaring mistakes, which could throw you off. If you want to travel '66, this is NOT the book you want to use.For a ""look see"" book, OK, but your money would be better spent on something like ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" by Michael Wallis.If you want to travel the route, spend you money on ""Route 66 Adventure Handbook: Updated and Expanded Third Edition"" by Drew Knowles or ""Route 66: EZ66 Guide for Travelers"" (best choice) by Jerry McClanahan.If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this book."
5,can't bring myself to buy a dyson,"was on the lookout for a new vacuum.Read all the reviews and the dyson sounded really good (despite the consumer guide report). However, could NOT bring myself to shell out $500 for a vacuum cleaner. Just seemed too extravagant for a household item that will sit in the closet for majority of the time. Found this by chance and decided to give it a try. Sanyo was a reliable brand. $90 bucks is reasonable,figure I could probably not go through 6 of them in my lifetime ($90 x 6 = 1 dyson). Was wonderfully surprised.Cleans well, not too noisy, no-smell thing actually works and dust cup easy to dispose of.Definitely recommended.Have had it for 4 mos, no complaints so far."
3,I love oldies,It's interesting the second time. Even my wife liked it some. But I have to see some movies 3 or 4 times to catch the director/author's meaning(s). Hope I can add to this!
1,stop writing books Beezley,"Don't even know where to start. I will just go with he can't write, and should spend more time teaching or something. His books are boring, and this one follows suit."
3,"Great vocalist, so so recordings","A great singer, mediocre recordings. Probably would not purchase again. But Corelli is a terrific singer and one of the best."
4,"The Dial Moisturizing Body Wash is a creamy, ...","The Dial Moisturizing Body Wash is a creamy, nicely scented body wash that works as advertised. It provides a rich lather and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. It's also antibacterial, which seems to be unique in the world of body wash. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a body wash."
4,Great Effects,"This is a recording of sound effects made with Moog synthesizers and live drums. Much of the disc is little more than sound effects, although a few tracks (notably the first one) do get funky with some steady live drumming and whacked-out synth noodling. I recommend it for anyone interested in weird synth music."
1,Pee Wee Necking? YUCK!,"I have been delighted to re-experience Pee Wee through the eyes of my kids, including Pee Wee's Big Adventure. I had not seen Big Top Pee Wee until this DVD as I had missed it when it was a theatrical release. It was with great excitement we popped the dvd in and it was so disappointing. The joy of Pee Wee was that he never grew up so why oh why is he necking with a buxom babe? Stick with Pee Wee's Big Adventure and the tv shows. Ignore this dud."
5,True Classic Movie,I watched this movie when it first came out and ordered it to have in my collection. My 7 year old grandson had never seen any Pee Wee shows or movies and fell in love with it the first time he watched it and has become one of his favorites.
1,Booo!!! Hisss!!,"Fans of Pee Wee's Big Adventure or Pee Wee's Playhouse should NOT see this movie. Summed, up it's just lame. It lacks the intelligent adult humor of the others and is basically just a kid's movie. If you're planning on buying this, DON'T. Buy Pee Wee's Big Adventure or wait for the Playhouse DVD set."
1,This was made in 2002???,"I can't believe this was made in 2002. It seemed more like 1992 with the friend's stone aged computer and the roommate going ""What's a screen name?"" He was like ""Chat room? What's that?"" ""Internet? Never heard of it. Is it new?"" I mean COME ON!!!This movie was a lesson on how to use the internet by someone who has never used it before. This movie is just stupid."
4,A good buy,"There is ample space to do projects....for my 6 year old daughter and myself. I can sit easily on one of the chairs...at an average size of 5'6"" 160 lbs.(and no, I don't mind listing that info!)The storage bins are a great addition because when we are done, we put whatever it is in them. It really helps her to keep the table top clear and objects off the floor."
4,Hidden shipping prices too high,"The item is fine, but my instruction label was torn off the rear of the bottle. Also, this product ships from a third party, not Amazon directly, and the shipping cost was about $6! Had I known, I would have purchased it locally!"
4,Strength Ball Training,I thought the book was informative. I am a personal trainer so I thought the book covered things from very basic to more advanced. All of the exercises were described in such a way that they were very easy to understand.
5,Two Very Different Bands; One Great CD,"Coalesce's covers of Boysetsfire's songs alone make this cd worth every cent you pay for it. I feel the covers of Coalesce's songs arent as strong, but are definately interesting and wont get ""skipped"" by your cd player. There is also one original song from each band on the cd, and both are what we've come to expect from these awesome bands. Definately worth getting for any collector or just enjoyer of music."
5,Surprised !!!,"It was a surprise to have discovered Nellie McKay's David via Last.FM when asking for similar s to Jill Tracy. I've ordered the three albums available in Amazon.com and I'm planning to get some tracks available on iTunes.My favorite still is ""Get away from me"" tough. If you are readinf this ;-), I would definitely recommend that you try it. last.fm, her myspace page or one of the sites nelliemckay.{com,net,org} which have tracks available. There's also some videos available on youtube."
3,Disappointing,I loved Get Away From Me but I'm having a hard time getting in to this one. Is it me or is she singing in totally the wrong key half the time? There are a few good tunes but it's a little dull compared with the first one. The collaborations are a complete waste of time.
4,Buy the debut first,"Her 18-track debut ""Get Away From Me"", produced by legendary Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick in 2004, is a masterpiece. Workaholic Nellie self-produced this 23-track followup just a year later, so it's hardly surprising that it's not as consistent, witty, or polished.Classics: ""The Big One"", ""Beecharmer"". Rockin': ""The Down Low"", ""Real Life"", ""Columbia Is Bleeding"". Good: ""I Am Nothing"", ""Mama & Me"" (despite the start and finish). Perfect trifles: the hilarious ""Pounce"", ""Lali Est Paresseux"", ""Food"". The rest: a lot of nice musical ideas with fairly banal lyrics. Buy this anyway and support one of the most promising new artists of the decade."
4,"Not for everyone, but fun and worth a listen","Nellie Mckay is refreshing, and so is her sophomore album.If you like her style, you won't be disappointed.Like her first album it is two cd's and each one could stand on its own.The songs are a little different from the last album, especially with sound effects and studio influence. It doesn't, however, sound overdone. Some songs are very easy to listen, while I find myself going over others after the first listen.This album's most notably difference is the diversity of the songs. I feel that she uses more styles in this album. If you never listened to her before, try her first album first."
3,"Some interesting stuff, needs editing","Pretty Little Head just didn't do it for me. I think Nellie's a rare talent and I loved her first album, but PLH is lacking. I think the production could have been a lot better and I that her piano playing is too much of a focus. Also, some of the songs are amateury and annoying and should have been cut. I don't know the whole story about Columbia, but I can see how better production and editing could have made this into a much better album. My feeling is that Mckay is an incredible talent but would do well with some direction from older and wiser muscians / collaborators, at least until she gets some more experience/maturity. Some interesting songs here in the mix, but overall, I'd recommend her first album ""Get Away From Me""."
4,Good seller,"It took some time for the book to be delivered, but apart from that the book was new and in good condition."
2,A fine asset,"The book on Rock MechanicsFUNDAMENTALS OF ROCK MECHANICS by JAEGER.J.C et al.,is an excellent presentation on the fundamentals.As a professional consultant and academecian I consider this book as a must in the library.While on the subject I appreciate the promptness of Amazon.com for the prompt services.Thank you,Dr.V.Balakumar,Consultant, Chennai 600 010."
4,The Clearasil goes on smoothly and rinses off ...,"The Clearasil goes on smoothly and rinses off with a minimum hassle. The fragrance is OK. The results after five days have been fairly quick, positive results -- drying up my skin without it feeling like it's dried-up. I would recommend it to friends and family, as a better option than some of the other products that are similar. It costs a little bit more, but in this case, you get what you pay for."
1,Awful sucky and a waste of time,This product did not work for me at all. It was chunky and somewhat thick. I used it for at least a month and my acne only got worse. DON'T waste your time using Clearasil Daily Face Wash. Try Clean & Clean Deep Action Cleanser.
3,"Flame of Udun? Nah, just a tealight","As a big fan of the Balrog, I own items such asLord of the Rings Balrog Wall Mount,Balrog - Flame Of Udun Sideshow Polystone Statue, andLord of the Rings Balrog Legendary Scale Bust Sideshow Collectibles. The only reason I wanted this one - which obviously on the surface looks like just another Balrog head, is that it has a spot for a tealight candle in the back, which creates a nice glow.The only downside to this is that it's extremely fragile and can easily break, like the stem off a wine glass.As a collector, I wouldn't spend too much on this item, and instead save it for a more durable item, such as the ones I listed above. But again, this is cool in the sense that it glows with the tealight, so if you can get it for a relatively cheap price, it'll make a nice addition to your Balrog shrine."
5,A classic,"This cd is wonderful. It is without a doubt a classic, even though all of ushers cd's since my way are classics. I really love this cd. You can just put this cd on repeat and listen to it the whole way through. I've heard it a million times. The only problem I have with it is it only has 10 songs, when it first came out, every song was soo good I was craving for more songs. But quality, not quantity. I can respect it!!!"
3,The Best of Usher's Albums!!,"Usher is not only SEXY but he's a gr8 singer and performer. His got gr8 songs throughout all his albums but i must say dat mY WaY waz smashin'. The only prob would b that darez only 10 songs but i think dis album is a must have 4 all Usher and rnb fanz.My Fav songz on tha album would b: -Nice and slow, Slow jam, U make me wanna, I will and Bedtime."
5,Awsome Cd,"I think this cd is my most favorite, because it turns me and my girl unto each other, its great to dance to and great for making love to my woman. Looking forward for the next cd. AWSOME WORK"
5,I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Usher is my boo! I love him and got most of his magazines. I plan to get his book about him growing up. I admire what he said on a magazine, when he said a girl can win a way to his heart if they take after his momma.I know I can win a place in your heart and I will always love you. I also liked when you said that you and Kidada were just friends.You look just like your moma,I bet you was a good momma's boy too. That was a tight car you bought your momma.You are a great actor and admire you for every thing you do."
2,an okay album,usher is catchy but overall his voice and music don't have much substance.he is a dime a dozen.he is about the same as genuwine.both inspired by bobby brown in dance and style but no vocal ability at all and no persona.you make me wanna was good and catchy and now it's all but forgotten.
3,Yep,Not as good as I remembered it being when I was younger. Probably still the best out of all of his music.
4,The album that elevated Usher to superstar status,"This album really put Usher as a core artist for both mainstream and urban radio with huge hits like U Make Me Wanna, My Way and Nice & Slow. However, as is the case with many radio artists, does the rest of their album live up to the singles? In this case, almost. First of all, there are only nine different songs on here. I'm not counting the extended mix of U Make Me Wanna. Second, very few of the songs besides the singles are noteworthy. The collaborations are pretty good here: Monica, Lil' Kim and Jermaine Dupri. Surprisingly, it's Lil' Kim's and Jermaine Dupri's raps that give the album the explicit sticker and not anything that Usher says. The major downpoint of the album is the annoying I Will. Overall, this is a pretty good album, but don't rush out to get it thinking it's great based solely on the singles. I'd borrow a copy first."
5,This CD is BOMB!,"I thought that this record was one of the best ever made. You can understand what he is saying and he gives everything a wonderful melody. If you are not sure about buying, do not hesitate any longer. BUY IT!!!!!"
4,Good Product with one minor flaw,"I recently purchased this product. It protects the phone well and looks sharp, but the top is very tight when installing/uninstalling. I thought I would break the phone in half. It also tore when I took the top off. Otherwise a good all around product."
4,"Great recording, but not Klemp's best","This is the recording that introduced me to Mahler's 2nd, and I'm glad that I chose Klemperer (whose name was, at the time, not as familiar to me as certain other conductors) over the competition. OK is a great conductor in Mahler, and the 2nd was his specialty -- his 9th is pretty good, too -- which is a good a combination. I have since obtained his live recording from 1965 with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, and I was blown away. It is magnificent, and the mezzo soloist is Dame Janet Baker, whose rendition of the fourth movement almost brings tears to my eyes. It doesn't seem to be available on Amazon.com...but you can probably get it in any decent store for about the same price as this recording. It is on EMI as well, in the ""Klemperer Legacy"" series. The sound is not quite up to modern standards, but it is in stereo and is perfectly acceptable, and you will not regret purchasing it."
4,"Good, but not great!","As heralded as this recording is, the CD simply does not reflect a good transfer from analog to digital. Compared to other performances of this work, the sound seems dead at times and the recording level extremely inconsistent at others. The finale is as advertised--together and generally inspirational. But it doesn't make up for the flaws noted above. The tempi are a bit unusual as well, ranging from plodding to agitatingly quick. Klemperer may have been one of the greats, but based on this recording alone, I have some doubts. Good, but not great."
3,Electronic version,"I have a bit of an interest in the actual scientific study of voice production, which is somewhat ironic considering I talk very little (usually) and I'm not much of a singer. This book looked interesting, and the electronic Kindle edition was free, so I thought I would go ahead and get it. So far it seems interesting enough, but I do have one issue. The book has over 60 illustrations...rather, it should have over 60 illustrations; however, the electronic version does not show these illustrations. It lables the illustrations (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc.), and it gives the captions, and the book seems to refer to the illustrations, but the illustrations themselves simply do not exist in the kindle edition."
5,Decorating with imagination!,"This is a great book for anyone who enjoys decorating. It's very descriptive and detailed. There are three chapters full of ideas, all with beautiful pictures, easy-to-do instructions with project patterns and cut-outs. Another chapter is devoted to personalizing your projects with unique details. There is also a chapter with instructions on decorative detailing; Antiquing, Gold Leafing, Crackling, Marbleizing and more. There's even a Metric Equivalency Chart for those of you who like to use exact measuring."
4,Still the Cars,"Beatitude is a Cars album all over again. It is Ric Ocasics first solo album after leaving the band. It is a very good disc, but lacks a little in fresh music. But, if you are a Cars fan, it is worth the time and money."
2,What Happened? Better than nothing I guess.,"I agree with the other statements about this DVD collection. It is better than nothing but why such a shabby treatment to a great band. I was a huge fan of the band and had seen them many times. Look for the good looking guy holding the bangles1 License plate in the ""Be With You Video? I have the VHS copy and was excited to see it was coming out on DVD. It looks ok then really grainy and then ok again. They added nothing on the DVD that would make you want to buy the DVD instead of the Video. With the release of ""Doll Revolution"" I thought we might actually get a quality DVD. The fans got slapped in the face. We can hope that they will redo the DVD the way it should be made. If you can find the VHS copy get it instead."
3,a let down but worth the experience,It's worth the read for the names and events that one encounters but I expected more of a work that's been awarded a Pulitzer; it is blantantly bias and I consider myself a liberal! I do believe instead of writing history Mr. Schlesinger was trying to woo the public.
5,perfect,"This was a great product at a good price. We used them to make ""Gospel Fuzzy"" gloves for our children. They have held up well over time."
4,How in the World Can the 1969 World Series MVP Omitted From this DVD????,"AS an avid Mets fan who worships the team through the highs and many lows, it baffles me how the organization can omit not one but TWO of their World Series MVPs (Donn Clendenon, 1969 and Ray Knight, 1986) from the Mets Museum. The team has only two world championships, both of which would not have been won if not for the accomplishments of their Most Valuable Players. But again, it's the METS we're talking about, who seem to do everything ass-backwards. The DVD is great, giving kudos to almost every player who wore the uniform. Ray Knight is given credit, but Donn Clendenon has been left out. I'll never understand how a team lauds their two world series victories but yet doesn't give credit to the man who played a HUGE part in their winning their first ring, first baseman Donn Clendenon. Like Gary Carter in 1986, Clendenon was indeed the missing piece of their championship puzzle."
5,Wartime sermons from a Christian pastor,"This is a book of ""enhanced sermons"" preached by the pastor of City Temple Methodist Church in London during the bombardment of England by Nazi Germany. He writes in the preface: ""As I write these words in the autumn of the year of our Lord 1940, my house in London trembles with the vibration caused by the firing of guns, the explosion of bombs, and the falling of houses. last night my elder son and I went on duty for the local air-raid warden in order that he might get what chance there is of a night's sleep..."" Weatherhead's ministry during this period has been described as nothing less that heroic. These are the sermons he preached to his people during this time. Amazingly pastoral, theological, biblical, and timely, yet still able to ""show us Christ"" in this day and age. Highly recommended. There are inexpensive copies here! Get one before the word gets out!"
4,weatherhead books,I have added this to my collection of generally hard to find books by Leslie Weatherhead. Thanks.
1,Don't Blame Dr. Tucker,"Ruth Tucker was indeed paid by Jews for Jesus to write the book. In fact, Jews for Jesus retained the right for the final edit of the book. We will never know what Dr. Tucker actually included in her book because Moishe Rosen made sure that the book was gone over with a fine tooth comb prior to being published. In effect, Jews for Jesus purchased a reputable name in an effort to lend credence to their activities and to rewrite history to their tastes."
4,An exploration of a struggling transgender teen,"This is a worthwhile read about a transgender teenager screaming to come out in the open and the struggle involved. It is told through the eyes of the sister and how her transgender brother's battle affects her life as she just wants to be normal and fit in with her peers. She's torn betweeen supporting and standing by her brother and yet wanting to avoid it all and live her own life. It was a bit depressing in parts, but overall I think it was enlightening and inspirational. It's message is to be who you and true to yourself at whatever the cost."
2,No clear effect on images,there is no clear effect on pics more than protect the lens. It is not a good deal
5,Great natural product,"We used to buy this product from Whole Food Store. Amazon offers a better price on this certain flvored vitamin C (blueberry flavor). The other flavor the peach one is not sold for reduced price. Other than that, they both taste great. My kids are looking forward to their Yummi Bear's gummy multivitamin and Natural Factor's vitamin C every day. It becomes their routine.Sometimes when they start craving for a piece of candy, we offer them a vitamin C tab, they are healthy and taste great. We adults love to take them too. Vitamin C is always a good health booster. I am pleased with the product. It is natural, no artificial colors or flavors as other similar products."
5,The Only One/Dark Descent,I absolutely loved this anthology. The only thing I could have asked for was more. I hope we get to see more of Joie and Traian. I think the story foreshadows more adventures to come and this one is another brillant addition to the dark series. Christine Feehan builds the characters and their story with a passion for everything that touches your heart and soul. I even found myself in tears at times when you feel the love between the two growing. I've read everyone of her books and this is a wonderful addition to my collection. Can't wait for next book to be published.
2,The Only One/Dark Descent,"I was really dissapointed in the ""Dark Descent"" anthology. This should be a complete Book. It leaves you hanging & wondering what happened to all the characters. What a great read it would be if Ms Feehan would only complete this story. Otherwise I wish I hadn't read it. To become involved in a story & there is no ending is depressing enough but there also is no beginning & a real lack of character development. Everyone I know who has read ""Dark Descent"" would like to see this story finished & hope Ms Feehan will consider this."
2,I was really disappointed!,"Christine Feehan is one of my favorite authors. I have had this book on preorder for months. I read it last night and was very disappointed. Part of the problem in the Feehan story seemed to be the editing. There was one part where Gary was able to communicate telepathically with Traian, but the story never indicated when the two had exchanged blood. The end was also very strange. I turned the page and thought to myself ""Are you kidding? That's the end of the story??! Nothing has been resolved!"" I really hope this is just a little bridge to the next full length novel because I was very disappointed when I finished the story.I bought this book for the Feehan story alone, so if you are in the same boat, you will want to read the story just in case it is setting us up for the next book, but be prepared to be left hanging!!!"
3,Will be a good product w/ modification,Seem to work fine so far. However I think I will change the strap and buckles supplied to a shoe string type fastener. I can double knot to make sure they stay tight and do not fall off. The buckles used on this product could easily open if it is bumped the right way. I do not want to lose a fin in the middle of the lake. No teather supplied to hold it if the buckles come loose.
5,Another great!,"This is another fabulous Lesley Pearce book, she takes you into your own world and you never want it to end"
4,Quite a bargain,"On the overall, this is a delicious set of interpretations of these symphonies. The one defining word would be ""energy."" In particular, the finale of No. 48 is taken at the fastest pace I've ever heard (close to a presto or maybe prestissimo), but every note is still clear and audible. There are no notes that are just played; every note is placed strongly. Accents are audible. Surprisingly, however, there is a beautiful amount of passion in the slow movements; the adagio of no. 44 practically aches. At times, as with the finale of no. 44, the orchestra's small size makes it sound slightly tinny and confined; at other times, as with the first mvt. of no. 46, there's a choppy staccato where there should be easy mellowness. When all is said and done, however, each symphony performance is generally spectacular, and getting six performances for the price of three is well worth the money."
4,very pleased,"product is great I love it, its made to last, very heavy and steady. Very easy to set up. Looks great in my home."
3,Stunning talent that should be appreciated by more,Shirley temple was an amazing actress as a children that has had at best several who come close. But she was and is unique. My kids just don't care for ST movies made when their grandma was 16 and I don't know why.
1,Don't waste your money:( !!,"...or your time into reading this book. It took all the grid I had to finish this one (I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't). The plot was so promising, but the heroine was dumb as a boot and extremely self-centered, and never grew up. By the end of the story I was hoping our wonderful viking hero would wake up and leave her on the mercy of her enemies. Melisande keeps repeating herself in all the conversations, so it felt like I was reading the same page over and over again."
5,"Beautiful illustrations, plot a bit mystifying","My 3 1/2 year old nephew loves this book. Little ""x"" is missing, and his alphabet friends fly off on a pencil to find him. X feels neglected in the real world, and he has found a home playing the xylophone for the ""M"" master. X's alphabet friends convince him to come home where he becomes the ""X"" kisses on mother's birthday cake. I'm pretty sure that most of this went right over my nephew's head, but he loves the bright colors, knew ""X"" was the missing letter, and enjoyed counting the kisses at the end. And and we both loved the illustrations!"
1,major disappointment,"What a disappointment. I always really enjoyed Robert Ludlum's books. And some of the books that appeared after his death, 'co-authored', weren't that bad. This however is absolutely awful. It is so bad and so unbelievable and so badly written, I had to give up. And I rarely do.Don't buy this, buy an original."
4,Who am I?,"Who am I? Where am I? And why are they constantly drugging me? That's pretty much the starting point of this book about Hal Ambler. A spy novel from Robert Ludlum extremely well written with a relatively simple plot and an ending that you're not going to expect.Once our main character clears from the drugged haze and remembers bits and pieces of his former life as a spy--and he remembers his name, he finds that the entire world has no record of him existing and no one knows him. His old College yearbook doesn't have a Hal Ambler. His old college roommate never heard of him... Flawed memory in our hero or world class conspiracy?? Read the book to see!I just listened to the UnAbridged version of the book--all 14 CDs worth of contents. OK, it took me about 3 weeks to get thru it, but, it was worth it!"
1,warning,the book realy should carry a warning.don't waste your time even reading the back cover.booooring
4,Exciting,Twists and turns from the beginning and a surprise ending make this a book worth reading. I couldn't put it down.
5,I wanted to be Ambler...,I thought this book was pretty cool. I wanted to be the main character or at least have his abilities. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to a friend. I might even keep it and read it again someday.
4,Kept my interest all the way through,"This is the first Ludlum novel I've read. Having been a fan of other authors such as Tom Clancy, Vince FLynn, and others, this novel was a real page turner. I thought it was very well written and kept a high level of suspense until the very end (even while he was describing the architecture and history of seemingly every building that the characters were in or near). I'm looking forward to reading more of Lulum's novels based on my experience with this book."
2,Disappointing--not up to the standard of Ludlum,"This book was a big disappointment. The pace was slow and repetitive and the plot was mired in extraneous details. I easily predicted the ending. If you like suspense thrillers, look for someone new. Posthumously published Ludlums aren't the way to go."
2,Wasn't worth what I paid for it,"I picked this book up at a $4 table for a read at the beach. What a disappointment, I grossly overpaid for it. A decent plot but poorly written and executed. At multiple points in the story there are long and in-depth sidetrips into Ambler's mindset -- boring boring boring -- that slow down down the pace to a crawl. Thankfully I could close my eyes and doze for a bit to recover enough energy to plod forward. I finished the story to see how it ended; the last 50 pages were more skimmed than read."
2,Not that impressed,"This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters. After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go. This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.Two - The reasonable female. The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here. No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it."
1,Doesn't live up to what it claims,"This mask claims to be a miracle mask. It left red blotches on my chin, and no noticeable difference after many applications. The tube is difficult to work as there are 2 separate creams which are supposed to be rubbed together to create your mask, but at the beginning I could only get one of them out of the tube. What a waste of money. You are better off buying a $4 mud mask from a discount store."
1,Not that great....,"As a fan of Bendis' 'Powers' line, I wanted to like this graphic novel, but I had to stop halfway because the story wasn't going anywhere. Sure, the characters are interested in a stash of money that some dead junkies spoke about, but there is nothing of high stakes really pushing this story.As another reviewer mentioned, the 'story' consists of individuals talking...and talking. Unfortunately, Bendis is trying to mimic real-world conversations, which doesn't always work well here. (Of note, there is a black character who happens to be a bounty hunter like the title character Jinx; unfortunately, Bendis decides to have this character speak stereotypically 'gangsta' which is particularly grating). Moreover, there is no one I can really root for in the story. Everyone seems to be self-pitying, or back-stabbing.Where he did a good job with 'Torso' and the aforementioned 'Powers,' I think Brian Michael Bendis misses the mark with this book."
3,"The Good,The Bad and The Jinx","Yes,our Bounty Hunter heroine,Jinx,assumes the Lee Van Cleef role in a plot taken directly from Eastwood/Leones ""Good,Bad & The Ugly"". Well,the ending turns out a little different(and maybe that's the surprise for those who remember the Eastwood movie),but the dialogue here is great. Bendis is a lot stronger as a writer than an artist,and it shows in this volume. I really liked the 4 page spoof of Jinx as ""The Incredible Jinx"",mocking the Hulk's short lived female counterpart. Bendis even has a page spoofing the Hostess ads found in mid-late 70s Marvel comics! Bendis reminds me of Frank Miller a bit; Both writers/artists who are better with stories than as competition for Frank Frazetta,and both with a noir fascination. Jinx is worth a look....."
3,"For ""modern"" vintage","When I ordered the book I was expecting a good share of the content to cover 1940s fashions (my favorite period). However, it mostly deals with what I call ""modern"" vintage (stuff I wore the first time around). It's a good book if that's your interest, but if its 1940s or earlier, move on."
2,very disappointing,"This book is really aimed at vintage fashion neophytes. For any one with more than a passing knowledge of vintage fashion save your money. As an aesthitic experience the book is great, lots of pretty pictures. However, there is nothing really of interest in the book. As a test if you know who courreges is do not buy this book, there is nothing here you don't already know."
5,Favorite gift for your little Diva!,My 4-year-old granddaughter could not stop smiling when she saw this vanity set. She loves it and plays with it every single day. The two little shelves are perfect for nail polish. The center drawer holds all the lip gloss and brushes any little princess could want. It is solid and big enough to also entertain 7-8-year-olds. I highly recommend this for all the little Diva's out there!
5,Not Captain Kirk,I cannot believe that Roger Corman lost money on this film. It is absolutely first rate in all categories. The black and white photography add to the semi-documentary approach to give us an almost newsreal-like film. This picture is years ahead of it's time in its approach to its subject matter - school desegregation and every character in the film rings true. The film looks and feels marvellous and packs a wallop. And William Shatner has never been better. Don't miss this one.
5,Hello Kitty Wall Decor,"My daughter loves Hello Kitty, and she loves having this hanging on her wall! Great quality item for the price!"
4,Perfect for nursery,"The pieces go great in my daughter's nursery. I was skeptical at first because of the price, but it's a perfect addition to the room. My 5 month old loves to look at Hello Kitty and smile and ""talk"" to her. It was easy to put up with the included hardware. Hello Kitty's antennae were bent out of shape when it first arrived, but I easily reshaped it back."
1,Not a happy customer,The first order came and it was broken. Sent it back and received a replacement and it was broken. Sent that one back also. At the time you applied a credit and cancelled the order. However I have yet to see that credit on my credit card. Wrote a letter ad complained. REceived a rely at which you gave me a credit with Amazon. But tried to buy something yesterday and was unable to find that credit. So all around not a happy customer. Would like someone to find out where my credit on my card is for starters.
3,A Little Old Fashioned,"This book is helpful if you are planning a old fashioned wedding. The projects use a lot of silk flowers, and have a antique look. The sort of things your Grandmother would make. Not very helpful for a modern wedding."
2,A lot old-fashioned!,I can honestly say I don't plan to use any of these projects in my own wedding/reception. Some wedding books from the 90s still have relevant things to carry into the present but this book does not. Many lacy/silk flowery/embroidery/cross stitch kind of projects. I only checked it out from the library because I saw that it had a tiara in the table of contents and even that looks super old-fashioned. If you have tons of sewing time to kill or like the look of many many decades past this book is for you. If you enjoy modern/timeless fashions pass this over.
4,heavy and emotional,"This album is fantastic. When I first heard it, I thought, ""Wow, what [fluff]]"", because it's quite simple and I couldn't stand death growls or screams at the time. But this is one of those great records that has you headbanging 'til the end, and mentally crying the whole way through. All of the soaring melodies and crushing riffs work together to create something that is both beautiful and terrifying, leaving a long lasting effect despite being quite repetitive and short. My favorite track is ""My Mirror No Longer Reflects""; it puts me under a waterfall of emotion. Overall, don't expect a Pink Floyd out of this band, but keep an open mind and you may get to love them."
5,Love 'em,"I'm new to float tubing so this is first pair used. However, I have done a lot of scuba diving and do have experience with fins. These go on easy, adjust to size easy, are comfortable and provide good thrust through the water. I did an entire loop around a small lake/pond and was very happy with the performance of these fins. Can't wait to get them back on. Good value too."
5,It is really true!,"I enjoyed this book because after visiting Madagascar and returning 5 times it is the most accurate book about what it is really like to be a guest in this beautiful country. I appreaciated the authors respect for the Malagasy people that I have come to love and admire. This is a great treatise in cross-cultural adaptation, wandering through a culture in which you have no clue what the rules and values are about."
5,Day Dream In Blue,I think the video to the song some how does the imposible ov making it sound better as once you seen it the whole song makes a bit more sence and i think what they have done is a fantastic brake from the norm but it's just a shame you don't hear anything from them
5,I really enjoyed it,I finally got around to seeing Roll Bounce and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you grew up in the late 70's and early 80's and frequented the skating rinks you are going to have a blast to the past and a good time. Enjoy.
2,The fundamental variety of culinary methods are lacking,I don't really know how to give this book a fair comment. I have found it a little bit simple in the variety of culinary methods being taught in this book. But it's fair to say that the recipes does works.
4,WOW! IT IS TINY!,"When I read the reviews, I thought ""How small could it be?"" I found out when it arrived. It does make a cute cake, but very, very small. Before ordering, make sure you get a tape measure, and realize the middle of the pan is thinner because of the shape. It is smaller than a nine inch round pan. It arrived in five days."
4,"Quirky, familiar territory for the Sandlin reader","I'm giving this one four stars, which is hard to do for a Sandlin book. But I think it's less to do with the writing than the fact that I've met these characters already in the second and third parts of the GroVont trilogy and like them better. Still, Western Swing is an excellent gateway drug to the rest of Tim Sandlin's collection. Sandling continues his theme of whispy men who need saving via strong women with commitment problems. If I had editorial power over this work, my only suggestion would be to kill the epilogue or at least revise it. After the dramatic mood swing from funny to depressing to ludicrous, it just didn't fit, that is unless you are the type who likes those ""where are they now"" moments at the end of Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High."
3,Not what I thought it was,This sock aid is not the soft sock aid that it looks like. It is actually very rigid and more difficult to use. I would not order this item again.
2,NOT flexible - Hard - Won't Bend to get sock on,"If have strong hands, socks with large easy opening and want this to be hard without bending - that is what this is.But if any hand troubles or just want easy flexible inserting for sock - this is NOT it. I bought this thinking it was the same as what I had, but definitely not.(I have size 8 feet)I guess hardness helps keep the opening very large but makes it impossible to get sock on due to hand difficulty. And I don't need an opening anywhere that large.Recommend instead:Carex Sock AidGood flexibility and still large enough opening for my 8 size feet."
2,Not designed for my needs.,I tried to use with compression stockings. This device was made for regular stockings. My mistake ordering this product. However I don't recall any indication as to the type of stockings that could be used.
5,Duro-Med Delux flexible sock and stocking aid,"This stocking aid is like a miracle worker!When my left hip became arthritic, I could no longer put my socks on or touch my toes. I struggled daily with so much pain.The Duro-Med flexible sock aid is actually fun to use, and I cannot believe how easy it works. I even use it to put on my other sock, even though I have no problem with my right foot.I advise everyone who has problems such as I had to invest in this very inexpensive sock aid. You will love it!"
3,sock aid,"This product works about as good as can be expected. It takes some practice and several attempts with some tight socks. Overall, I would say it does its job as advertised."
3,"EXQUISITE, BUT VERY INCOMPLETE....","THE ESSENTIAL FRED ASTAIRE IS A GOOD OVERVIEW OF HIS MANY FILM AND THEATRE SONGS. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS ISSUINGS OF ASTAIRE HAVE INCLUDED MANY, MORE SONGS FROM HIS FILMS AND SHOWS. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS TO OFFER A THREE-DISC SET THAT WOULD DOCUMENT ASTAIRE'S EXTRAORDINARY RECORDINGS SHOW BY SHOW AND FILM BY FILM. WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SONGS, THEIR COMPOSERS AND FRED ASTAIRE'S ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THESE RECORDINGS BE ISSUED IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND WITH AN ESSAY DETAILING THIS NEVER EQUALED, PHENOMENAL MUSIC.....PLEASE SONY DO THE RIGHT THING AND ISSUE THE COMPLETE FRED ASTAIRE ON CD..........GARY JASINKONIS........EAST NORTHPORT, NEW YORK........"
3,Doesn't quite follow the book.,"I was a little surprised when I was reading along with the audio book that it skipped some portions of the book. Although, some of these portions are just more detail description of certain events. I feel like it takes away some incites to the book though. I believe the reader should have read every single word without taking away from Dalai Lama's truth meanings."
5,The old spy in the box trick!,What a great show......I mean really the box set is very very well designed and mostly everything about it is top notch and at the time the price was too good to pass up. Highly recommend to any fan!
5,Get-GetSmart,"I bought it because I used to watch it as a kid and I'm sure I never saw all the episodes.A great addition to your collection. The disc's are single sided not the flip disc's , huge plus.Basic design label, nice package to keep them together. My daughter , who never saw it before was intrigued by the telephone booth in the box. A pamphlet inside with episode listing and brief history.The pilot is in black and white. Full frame. I just started watching them and it will take a while to get through all of the discs. A good value at this discounted price."
4,And loving it! ...mostly,"This is a fantastic set for people who are long-time fans of the show or for those who have just been introduced to it. I loved watching every minute of every episode, and the bonus features are fun, too. The only reason this set loses a star is because of the packaging. Don't get me wrong, I love that it comes in a phone booth, but it is sometimes difficult to get the individual seasons in and out and it it can be hard to get the plastic sleeves back on them, too. Overall, though, it's a great set and totally worth it, if you don't mind wrestling with the packaging a little bit."
1,More Madacy trash...,"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out Charlie Chaplin DVD's). This is a shame because younger folks who've never seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression."
1,Subtract one star. Appalling DVD ruins some classic comedy,"W. C. Fields's short comedies of 1932-33, produced by Mack Sennett, offer some of this great comedian's best work. However, this particular DVD edition treats Mr. Fields (and the purchaser) quite shabbily. The sound is not always synchronized with the picture, the image is often gray, and in at least one instance the film seems to be copied from a VHS tape recorded at the slowest speed. Just plain bad; don't throw your money away (we did, and we also threw the discs away)."
1,Terrible sound and picture,"I made the mistake of buying this DVD. The picture quality is awful and the audio is practically unintelligible. That's too bad, there's some funny stuff in there."
5,Some secrets.....,"Some secrets just shouldn't be kept. The secret bonus track at the end of the disc is a collaboration with Darius Rucker that should be a #1 hit. That song, ""Yesterday,"" is worth the price of the disc by itself. Imagine Rucker with the acoustic guitar style that compliments most of his catalog and a hot brass section. The Bradshaw Trombone solo is like sweet icing on a cake."
5,Bone Deep is Amazing!!!!,"Hey All:I have just heard this record ""Bone Deep"" by Jeff Bradshaw and its simply incredible. I saw him when he was on the road with Jill Scott and this record delivers all the way. Jill Scott, Glenn Lewis, Floetry, Bilal, Gerald Veasley all guest on this record. My favorite songs are ""On my Way"", ""I'll Always Think of You"", ""Beyond the Stars"", and ""Smooth Soul"" but all of it is something that needs to be heard. Trust me ""Bone Deep"" is one of the best records of the year!!! Run and get this masterpiece!!!"
3,Somewhat helpful,"Lots of info in this book but it is somewhat dated - since the book was written environmental laws have changed much of wood finish chemistry and the author's treatment of varnishes is obsolete.There are now many proprietary gunstock finishes on the market that appeared since tis book was written.Nonetheless there is some useful info, especially if you've not done much wood finishing before.There are curious omissions - how to work with alkanet, used by the great London gunmakers, for example, is not in this book!Do not expect a ""do-it-yourself"" manual."
1,More Madacy Entertainment trash...,"Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio.

1,Self Serving junkie garcia record. Not a Mercedes Sosa album.,"junkie charly garcia somehow conned Mercedes Sosa, one of the top singers Argentina and the world has ever had, to record his songs - supposedly for her to attract a younger audience, and for him to receive some royalties so that he could continue on is drug spree and destruction of hotel rooms (already corny and passe acts - it's already been done by more talented bands int he 70's). Imagine if you will, Bette Midler singing the ""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" album, or selected pieces from the GG Allin catalogue. The singer's persona, talent, presence and voice are tearfully wasted in this record. My personal Mercedes Sosa album is ""Mujeres Argentinas"" - a timeless piece, and a jewel in her long career, and one I would recommend instead of this piece of junk. What a colossal and sinful waste!"
2,Boy by Roald Dahl,"Boy, by Roald Dahl, takes place in Norway, England, and Wales. His family lives in Wales and vacations in, his parents' former home, Norway. When Dahl was a kid, he was schooled in England. An important person is his beloved mother who raised him, and his sibling, single-handedly. Dahl's siblings were also important to him. Important childhood events are: when he dropped a dead mouse into a sweet shop jar owned by an evil woman; getting bullied by Boazers, which are like school prefect if you didn't know what a Boazer is; getting his adenoids removed; getting a job in Africa as a young man; and almost having his nose cut off in a car accident.Our opoinion is Boy by Roald Dahl is boring, if you're like us, who like fiction books; it's an autobiography. It was also very boring because, he gave small details, and not all of our questions were answered. But, if you like non-fiction books, you'll probably like Boy."
4,A Review for Boy,"Boy was a very interesting book by Roland Dahl. Through his descriptive writing, Dahl, explains the story of his childhood, in great detail. This book has an interesting plot, explaining Dahl's time as a student. Through out this book Dahl, criticizes English schools of the time, for their brutality.In my opinion this was a good book, for many reasons. This book had some humor, as well as many other good things, but I don't recommend this book for younger readers, although this book is a fairly easy read, some parts of the book get very descriptive in violence, and is probably not something you want a child to read about."
2,Not like the BFG,I think that this is R.D worst book. It is less interesting than the other ones. I think boys would like it more though. I guess it was pretty good.
3,This book is about the happy and sad life of Roald Dahl,"In the beginning, this book is really boring. Then Dahl takes you into his life as if you were in his shoes. Some chapters are hard to understand, but most are great!"
5,A great book!,"Boy is a great children's book! When you read it, you feel like Roald Dahl's right there with you telling the story! This book is about Roald Dahl's childhood, and explains it with great detail! If you like this book, you'll also like the sequel to this book called Going Solo, a book about Roald Dahl's army life, and starts where this story left off. Boy is a great book, Roald Dahl is a great author, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
5,WEDDING CANDY BAR,My daughter got married and wanted to have a candy bar. Her colors were European Grey and accents of Watermelon. We did the whole candy bar in those colors and also used white. It was beautiful and candy was fresh.
3,"Dell Q1700 17"" LCD Tv",This seems to be a good product. Refurbished. There was no owners manual so i am having trouble at times figuring out how to get things from popping up on the screen. I use this is a TV only.
3,"best tv/monitor ever, BUT....","This, by far has been my favorite TV/Monitor EVER. The picture quality was great, the sound was great, the monitor was GREAT. I thought we hit pay dirt with this one...until the picture died. Flat out died. I loved this monitor so much that I bought four other big name tv/monitors (Sharp/Samsung/Panasonic, etc) before I ultimately went back to the Dell W1700. None had good sound, none had a monitor that felt suitable. Mostly, the sound and picture were horrible. It was a blessing in disguise when I found another Dell W1700. Well, this one only lasted a year. They just don't last. It seems to be a flaw with this model and probably the reason why Dell has discontinued it. I'm telling you, I absolutely LOVED this tv/monitor especially the Picture in Picture feature. I loved being online while the TV was viewable in a smaller box on the same screen. BUT, I'm done replacing it every year or two."
2,small and scratchable,"We have had the table for 3 weeks. When I walked in to see it assembled, it looked like a miniature version of what I thought it would be. Last night I cleaned it, and now half of the paint is gone."
1,This book could not hold my attention,"I tried to like this book. The first few pages were promising. I liked Kate, at first.But I did not like the hero, and after awhile, the story just got boring, tedious and not worth my time. I finished the book, but I wish I hadn't."
3,I prefer Mama's Gun waay more,"I bought this album without ever hearing it. I had high hopes for it but for some reason I did not like it. I really did like the beats in the music, but I did not like Baduh's singing. Although everyone who has this album bought it for Baduh, I would buy it just for some of the cool beats. But Mama's Gun is a different story. I would recommend anyone Mama's Gun. It's a whole lot better than Baduizm for me."
1,Yawn,"I guess I will never understand the soul of soul music. Especially not when it is this modern soul stuff which has elements of disco and sleepy drum-machine rhythms.Erykah Badu is a great singer, all right, but this album lacks fantasy and creativity. Even as a jazz admirer, I don't see the greatness of Baduizm... the jazz inspiration is so tiny and so hidden that it takes good ears and patience to discover it.Yawn."
5,Awesome!,"Evocative of torch singers from the 40's and 50's,with a husky,smoky,lived-in voice,sometimes playful,completely soul-filled,well worth owning,I'm on my 3 cd,highly recommended,enjoy!"
2,Not that great for sensitive skin,"I have eczema on my hands and I was hoping that ""for sensitive skin"" meant it wouldn't irritate my hands. It stung just like any other bar of soap. It didn't seem spectacular in any way. Just regular soap."
3,"Pretty good,but they were better Session cats","Toto had some cuts that I dug like ""Hold the Line"",99,Georgy Porgy,I'll suppply the love&I won't hold you back. but alot of the time they wore whatever Project there working on to enter upon there Band Material.RIP to Steve Porcaro. Porcaro is One of the Tightest Drummers Ever. the rest of the cuts have that california studio Shine which after a while is a bit too slick for it's own good. but the cuts that stand out are cool."
4,Great compilation for Toto fans,"This is a great compilation album for Toto fans it includes all the hits including Hold the line,Rosanna,Africa,I'll be over you. The only that i could find is that the compilation does lean fairly heavily on their grammy winning Toto IV album ( it includes all three hit songs from that album and one or two selection from other albums). Over all though it is a good compilation and does give a very good overview of the peak period of Toto's career through all their many bandmember changes including the return of original lead singer Bobby Kimball after a 15 year absence. The album also includes Pamela from The Seventh One, The Turning Point from Tambu, The title cut from the new Mindfields album and a rare live recording of On the Run from their appearance at the 1991 Montreux jazz festival excerpted from Toto XX."
2,Another bad remaster !,"TOTO are amazing , all of these songs are amazing , pretty great compilation for any casual toto fan or a general hits collection for a big fan .... Too bad the Remaster is average at best , they took all the life out of these amazing sounding recordings , they are pretty pinned in the master & your ears get quite tired if you want to listen to this at any volume , if your an ipod or computer listener you'll probably enjoy this , if you are into audiofile this cd does not deliver , what a bummer .."
1,"Um, where is ""Stranger In Town""?","Not only is it one of my favourite Toto tunes, but it was also a Top-40 hit! Why do they keep leaving it off of their compilations? Oh well, looks like I'll have to make my own greatest hits with my cd burner..."
5,Glad to Purchase,I love hearing the old songs of Toto. The sound is very clear and loud because of the remaster of the songs. It is great I'm glad I purchased it on Amazon. Great Job Amazon!!!!:)
5,Chistophorus Robinus,"""The only New York Times Bestseller in LATIN ever!""That's what it is folks. If you are a Latin student and want to improve your Latin in an entertaining way, Winnie Ille Pu read along side the English version of Winnie The Pooh is the way.The Latin version even has the clever illustrations and map of the woods (mapped in Latin, of course).There are notes at the back of the book for each chapter for the tricky word or phrase.You will feel like a Latin scholar when even without the English version alongside you can begin to make out:""Chistophorus Robinus summa in silva habitabat. Pluebat, pluebat et pluebat sed aqua ad domum eius pervenire non valebat."""
4,"Great Product, Poorly Shipped","On the basis of an America's Test Kitchen recommendation, I purchased this heavy-gauge baking pan and, just as ATK said, it doesn't warp in the oven. No baking sheet, however sturdy, can survive being shipped across country in an unpadded plastic bag without some damage. Mine arrived scratched and a little dented. I wrote to complain to the seller, but have not received a response. This is a great baking pan, but exercise caution if purchasing it from Next Day Gourmet."
5,perfect,perfect heavy duty panhasnt warped in almost a year of usei will never buy another: this one looks like it will last forever
1,keep checking the bottom,"I also got the wrong pan, a Wearever pan without the reinforcing in the edge and only partially rolled edges. AND the packaging was terrible, just thrown in a box with a few crumpled pieces of paper. Amazon should stop using this vendor."
1,This pan warps!,"I can't understand how Cooks Illustrated could have rated this pan as it did. It warped the first time I used it! It has a nice heavy feel and it cleans easily, but the warping issue isn't acceptable to me.I guess it's not such a great bargain after all."
3,Was looking for a heavy duty pan half sheets,"I needed several heavy duty pans to roast vegetables and other foods in. I wanted pans that did not buckle wen taken out of the oven.The first time I used them they immediately buckled. I was disappointed. Obviously they still function OK, but look horrible and store poorly."
5,So far so good,I purchased this sheet pan based on the reviews on America's test kitchen and so far it is working great. It is easy to clean and did not warp. We are a family of six and cook at home almost every night so the pan has been used often with a variety of foods from cookies to frozen breaded tilapia. We are very happy with our new purchase and are buying a second.
2,Didn't perform as expected,"I bought this pan with the understanding that it would withstand high heat, up to 500 degrees without warping. First time I used it in a 450 degree oven, I heard the ping of warping coming from within. Very disappointing....."
5,Best sheet pan ever!,"I love, love, love this 13 guage sheet pan! I too ordered it because of the Cook's Illustrated review. Every other sheet pan I have had has warped terribly in the oven, causing foods to slide together during cooking. But not this one! My only complaint is that it's not dishwasher safe (I found out the hard way! However, it only affected the finish...and since I always use parchment underneath the food, putting it in the dishwasher once only changed the pan's appearance.)"
2,Beware sharp edges,"Like everyone else, I read the Cooks Illustrated review of this pan, Vollrath Wear-Ever model 5214. It is indeed very heavy and sturdy, but the edges are sharp and very rough/uneven. I had to use sandpaper to smooth the edges before I was able to use it. I was expecting a much higher quality finish for this price."
1,I would have rated this pan and Next Day Gourmet lower with no stars if that had been an option,"I do not typically write reviews; however, these sheet pans are horrible. After reading the different reviews, I ordered this pan with some hesitation. I ordered two pans because I am in the process of updating my cookware and bakeware. When I received the pans, they were STUCK TOGETHER and could not be seperated. The sheet pans were very cheaply constructed. The etching on the bottom sheet pan indicated that I received the sheet pans that I had ordered. However, I have never seen sheet pans of such poor quality. I am returning the sheet pans without delay. Obviously, here is a real problem with the quality of the products and how the products are distributed from Next Day Gourmet. I do not recommend this product or the distributor. I did call customer support, and was told that if I return the sheet pans, that my money will be refunded. I am returning the sheet pans today. I will update this review."
4,Solid but slow,"It is certainly a solid piece of literature, and I personally find Kazantzakis' angle of approaching the story of Christ very fascinating. So, in that regard I don't have much to add to the praise of the prior reviews, it certainly is a good book.However, for my taste it was definitely too slow and, in places, too obvious. You can guess something that's going to happen many, many pages before it will, and it's not only because the basic story is known to everyone - Kazantzakis takes his time and moves very slow; although very emotional, his writing style is not at all intense. But this may have more to do with my personal tastes :)."
3,one of the most boring books ever written,"I found this book to be compelling yet at the same time, extremely slow moving and tedious. It is too kong winded for its own good. Instead of saying ""Jesus crossed the street"", we have to learn what Jesus wore at the time, how fast he walked, whether he was hot, cold, tired etc. The compelling ideas are lost in the teduious and sometimes unnecessary dialog that pervades every part of this book."
1,Typical,"This book is quite typical of the extremely skewed view of Jesus the Christ and his relationship with his wife, Mary Magdelene. This book does NOT even come close to touching, even remotely, the REAL truth!!!"
4,Great old Movies,Great buy for the folks who like those old black and white movies. I always liked the Bulldog Drummond movies. Thats why I always go to Amazon when I'm looking for bargains.
5,"Nice lesson, cute story","A humorous story that is an example of perserverance. A little pig called Poppy wants to be a tightrope walker but finds it is not an easy task. But with the helpful encouragement of her mother, Poppy continues to try and finally succeeds at the circus act. Good read aloud for young children, it would be a wonderful book for teachers to illustrate the lesson in a classroom discussion. Nice looking book, colorful illustrations. It would also be a nice, appropriate gift for a child. Highly recommended."
3,"good quality, rotten instructions","I consider myself reasonably handy. Over the years, I have put together a lot of toys and sports gear, made lots or household repairs and figured out a lot mechanical problems. But the Lifetime instruction booklet was my Waterloo. I must say that the quality of the product is good; no problem there. But the instructions are confusing and incomplete.Each step consists of an exploded drawing of parts with a self-evident sentence, such as ""Place the plastic rim guard on the back of the rim"" and ""Make sure the U-bolt is in the notches."" At one point, I realized the wrong springs had been packaged for the rim spring-back feature; a call to the company fixed this, but it was three days of waiting for the proper springs. The company needs to put some work into these instructions, including more descriptive writing about parts assembly. Assembly is nightmarish using the existing instruction manual."
1,Buyer Beware,"The content within this CD fall far short of the visualization skills promised on the cover. I became concerned when I was about 30 minutes into this one hour long CD and they were still going on with testimonials and claims. Only in the final 15 minutes did they get into any practical visualization technique. And I use the word 'technique' loosely, it consisted of a simple relaxation exercise followed by an exercise to ask my inner guide for help. Really?? I bought this on Saturday and returned it on Sunday!If you have a preoccupation with useless drivel, or if you like paying roughly $15 for $2 worth of useless information then by all means buy this CD.What a joke."
4,scare your friends,"I know this raver girl who I irritate with my music whenI can. This is the only band that she will absolutely notlisten to at all, and she'll even deal with the Mentors fromtime to time. In my opinion there are a couple songs onhere that you have to skip, but the percentage of them ispretty...low for a metal band. BESIDES justscaring your friends, you can use it to get inspired to bea better person by being more Satanic, which is better."
2,I floss my teeth every night using tape-type ...,"I floss my teeth every night using tape-type floss. I had tried the regular Glide and really hated it. This is better because it was thicker, but I still didn't like it nearly as much as my regular brand. The two primary things I disliked about it were: it's made of a plastic-feeling material and cut into my fingers when I used it, and because it feels slippery, it doesn't seem to remove plaque nearly as well as my usual brand. I don't expect to use it again, nor would I recommend it to friends or family."
1,BROKE WITH IN 30 SECONDS!!!!,"BROKE WITH IN 30 SECONDS!!! My 6 year old was super excited to get this ... and just as sad when it broke so quickly! At this price, we expected a little more!"
1,Disappointing. Please heed reviews on this one folks.,"Very disappointing toy. Probably would be fun if it works. The one I ordered for my grandson did not work. It would not even turn on once, and we tried several different sets of fresh batteries. The reviews for this toy are not stellar but I thought I'd take a chance. Seriously, if you're thinking of buying this toy, think again--it is junk."
2,You have to be a SUPER skipper!,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 4 year old son and 2 1/2 year old daughters. Seemed like it would be fun for all of them. Was excited that it had 3 speeds as I was sure we would be using the slowest one! Well, our plan is now to work up to the slowest speed! This thing whips around so fast that even I have a hard time keeping up! There is no chance that any small child still working on coordination would ever be able to play with this! My kids have repurposed the jumping arms as swords and this seems to still make them happy. So not a total waste, but still disappointed."
4,Life of Jesus the Revolutionary,"This is a well made film that is not only accurate to the Biblical account, but entertaining and inspiring."
4,Jesus Christ DID exist,"The assertion that Jesus Christ never existed by a reviewer below is beyond ridiculous. Whether you accept Him as your savior or not, his existence is thoroughly documented in many sources, including from those who were hostile to him and would have preferred he didn't exist - the Romans and the Jews. We have many reliable ancient Roman and Jewish texts from the time period of Jesus that corroborate his life and the message of the Gospels.Only the most rabid, fanatical atheists deny the existence of Jesus. For factual information corroborating the existence of Jesus, I recommend ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel."
1,THINK BEFORE YOU BUY THIS,"They call this My All/Stay Awhile becuase at first you'll Stay but after Awhile you'll get bored. The ""Stay Awhile"" excerpts totally take the beauty out of the song, making it sound like trash, and Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz add to the trash with their stupid rap."
3,Saved by The Roof remix,"The reason they call this the So So Def remix is because thats what'll happen to your eyes if you keep listening to it. The Roof remix is tight, it's 8:28!"
4,absolutely delightful,"Patty Ho is multi-racial, with a white father whom she's never met and a domineering Taiwanese mother. Feeling like a loathed outcast in her town, Patty also feels restricted at home. A fortune-teller predicts that she's going to end up with a white man, which freaks out her mother. Patty is sent to math camp at Stanford University. Now in a city far more liberal and open-minded than her hometown, her mind veers off math to a realm of new friends and beautiful boys. This book was absolutely delightful with serious issues of identity and racism, and light-hearted facets of romance and friendship."
2,can this be put into DVD. Most look at dvd's,"Ths would be good being on DVD. Most people look at DVD's. This movie is on DVD, but it's not a movie. It's all about showing and no real talking like a movie."
1,"Ad is incorrect, does NOT fit 1 1/4 "" hitch","Beautiful hitch cover, but does NOT fit 1 1/4 "" hitch, as advertised. I searched all over for 1 1/4"" and thought I had found one. Received it early, just in time to travel to two consecutive away games, but can't use. Waiting to see what happens with the $13.99 shipping I paid!"
5,Perfection,"In my opinion, Sills is a remarkable vocal artist. I find her voice quite beautiful, yet with a reedy edge to it that gives her vocal instrument an incredible ability to express many colors of emotion (much like Callas). She also has brought a quality of intelligence, warmth and vulnerability to the character of Violetta that I haven't heard or seen in others, and I own 5 different recordings of La Traviata, and have seen 3 productions of it. So if you are looking for advice on what recording of this incredible opera to get from someone who has listened to many different recorded and live productions of it, my advice is to BUY THIS ONE! It's the best in my opinion regardless of its great bargin price."
2,"no, Callas is the best Violetta","Sills is a great Lucia and Cleopatra. But Violetta belongs to La Divina, Maria Callas."
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this at Walmart. They had three, and I bought the one that had not been returned. When I got it home one of the fittings was unglued. Now I know why the other two were returned."
5,Definately worth it.,"Like the other reviews state, its even better once you actually have it in your hands. It will look awesome on just about any other vehicle. I have on my truck I use to hunt down wild hogs every week with and the game wardens just love it to!"
5,Beautiful Opaque coverage,"I love this paint! It is very opaque, covers on the first coat and is wonderful as a base for acrylic paints. I am an artist and use it as a base for resin dolls."
1,Quality of book NOT TRUE!,I chose a used book that was marketed as used-acceptable. Every page is full of highlighting and underlining. There are personal notes in the margins and even a grocery list written on the publishers page. This book would never be allowed to even be traded at a book exchange. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
3,Good counterweight but author out of his expertise,"Watch out when an economist begins talking about law (or, like Posner, a lawyer talking about economics).Another good book in this general line is Fenton Bailey's ""Junk Bond Revolution"". Very well written, probably by a ghostwriter.A useful counterweight to conventional received wisdom, but, keep in mind, that experts are hired mouthpieces, and Alan Greenspan once testified on behalf of Charles Keating."
2,"Pick, Pick, Pick.",This product was formerly produced in the US. It now comes from China and it has a rather nasty aftertaste and collapses easily.
1,"Underwritten, Predictable, Boring and Way Too Long","i love bridget jones's diary. that pretty much tells everything about me. so, like many other bridgetlites, after finishing bjd 1 and 2 (plus her guide to life and the movie, of course) i decided to try other books in the field. i read anna maxted, louise rennison, and finally stumbled across ""the trials of tiffany trott"". the cover looked interesting and the flip wasn't too bad so i bought it. maybe i'd love it, i thought. and now, 404 pages later, i hate it. this book is so predictable and underwritten that a 7-year old could have done a better job. this book could have been a pamplet with it's horrible storyline that a quarter-way through i was already yawning and waiting for the end, when finally the foolish ""heroine"" would shag SS and the whole sorry affair would end. if you haven't already bought the book or read it, i urge you to pass it unless you like being bored to tears."
2,Not That Good!,"The Trials of Tiffany Trott really left something to be desired. The characters were one dimensional and boring. Half way through the story I could have cared less if I even continued. The premise of the story is that Tiffany Trott is a single girl, who mind you gets dumped on her birthday and is trying to find love. She places an ad in the paper and gets a number of responses. One is from Seriously Successful, whom she falls for. But, the catch is he is married. She works hard to meet someone else ... and as you can tell ends up happily ever after (or there about). I really wish that the story could have been more interesting. Create some characters who a 30 something woman can feel for. Instead I read this wondering how she could write so many pages of dribble."
1,A more annoying character I've NEVER met...,"I have to say, that after reading all of the reviews of this book, I was really looking forward to this one. And I was highly disappointed. Tiffany Trott has to be one of the most annoying female characters I have ever read. Bridget Jones, she is not. I took this book with me on vacation and was expecting to finish it in a day or so. It took me 5 days to dredge through all the horrific dates in this book. I kept on through it all, hoping that the ending would redeem the rest of the novel. No such luck. (Upon finishing this book, I threw it against the wall of my hotel room in disgust)! Tiffany Trott as a book and a character has little, if any, redeeming qualities. My advice: stick to Bridget and leave this wannabe alone!"
1,Beyond Silly,"This novel is just childish and silly. If you enjoy books such as Bridget Jones Diary and 4 Blondes, you will enjoy this silly book also."
2,This book is at best mediocre,"I am in my upper 20's and truly enjoyed the book ""Getting Over It"". I looked for recomendations based on that book and ""The Trials of Tiffany Trott"" was suggested to me. I did not enjoy the book. If you are looking for a story about a sad woman who cannot ever find a man, then you might enjoy this. The whole book is date after unsucsessful date. And the ending was very disappointing to me. If you enjoyed ""Getting Over It"" like I did, I would steer clear of this book, it is not the same humor."
3,"Cute and fun, but nothing special","This was an enjoyable book, but not ""unputdownable"" and definitely not memorable. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more in the summer on the beach. But it's fun, light reading, and I even laughed out loud a few times. It actually reads more like a series of short anecdotes, which makes sense since it is based on the character of the author's newspaper column. I think I would have enjoyed it more as a weekly column, rather than an entire book. Even the way the book ends makes it seem like you'll be waiting to read about the character's next adventure in next week's column."
2,No Bridget Jones,"I bought this book thinking it would be full of fun, witty British humor about a single gal. Well, I got the part about single gal right. The book dragged in several places. If you are expecting something on the level of Bridget Jones, Four Weddings and a Funeral, or Sliding Doors, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, the book was only mildly entertaining."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I found the trials of Tiffany to be not so funny . It was a bit long and I found myself skipping paragraphs. Overall, it was cute but not something I would put on a my A list."
2,"Disappointing ending, sometimes annoying","I picked up this book because of the apparent similarities to Bridget Jones' Diary. It was an okay book in that I wanted to finish it and find out what happened. However, it just so happened that the copy of the book I had was missing the last pages (the pages 344-377 just kept repeating to the end), so I had to go through the trouble of going back to the bookstore to get a new copy to find out if Tiffany finally found the man she was so desparately looking for."
2,What's Going On!,I hate that this book is like reading all the other Christina books. Sterling always has some kind of problem whether it is wanting to run like in a race or doesn't listen or is scared of the water jump. It's getting old and you'd think she would learn by now. Plus jumping is getting on my nerves. Where did all the racing go! Also this book said Sammy wrote a letter from Ireland but it never says what it says or why Sammy moved to Ireland. Where did everybody go! <(Including characters and Joanna Campbell)
3,This Book Was So Boring!,I use to love this series because it was about horse racing.Now all it talks about is jumping.I'm sorry but I don't care about jumping all that much.I use to be able to read these books as soon as I got them and finish them within a couple of hours because they made me want to find out what happened.But now all the books are about the same thing.Some problem Sterling's having.All in all I just don't like these books anymore now that my favorite people are out of the picture.And besides these books don't even tell you what happened to Cindy or Max or Tor or really even Samantha.All it says is that she moved to Ireland but it doesn't say why. I hoping that they will come out with some super editions or something telling the readers what happened.And I really hope Joanna Campbell comes back really soon.Even though I don't really like this series anymore I'll probably still collect these books since I already have every one. Please come back soon Joanna Campbell.
2,What has happend to the books,I agree with what all these people have said about this book. I mean what has happened to the racing and the thrill of who wins and makes it and stuff like that. It was always fun following Prides racing career and stuff like that because it was fun and umpredictable. I personally like show jumping but I agree it does not make for as exciting of books as racing does.P. S. Anyone who reads this and knows what happend to the Joanna Campbell I would appreciate knowing. I was reading all the comments that said where did the author go or when is she coming back and I did not know she was gone. The books says they are created by her. So email me if you know.
3,Needs improvement...,"""Dylan's Choice"" was definently not a book for people who like everything to be perfect, I should know, I am one. Things go wrong for Dylan and Christina right from the start. Christina can't tell why Dylan has been acting so strange lately, but he obviously gets a lot of rap from ""the guys"" for spending so much time at the barn. Who could blame him for being a little uncomfortable?"
1,I can tell this one is going to be a sleeper.,"This plot is old. And it's all going to stupid. Did Joanna Campbell write this one? I hope that the next book, A Home for Melanie, which I don't know what it is about, has at least SOME racing in it. I still am a loyal reader, beleave it or not."
2,overall unhelpful,"I bought this book used and found that it did a really poor job of pointing out the implications of the rules of evidence. Other than perhaps the difference between the common law and FRE, I found it to be too brief. I feel like there is little debate in evidence as to what the rules is, but rather, it is when it applies, which this book barely addresses. Try Emanuel's which gives detailed hypotheticals and examples."
1,So noisy I can't use it,"I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can't hit the road because of work (or weather) complications. If you are like me that means weekdays late at night, or very early in the morning.I'm terribly frustrated because I can't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes. My neighbors can't stand it. Hey, I can't stand it! The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner. To give you an idea, I don't even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing.Don't buy it! Go for the magnetic resistance models."
2,Unusable for watching TV,"While this trainer is a cheap alternative to the fluid 2, it is so incredibly loud that it isn't possible to watch TV while using this. I am very disappointed. Looks like I'm going to end up paying a ton to send this item back."
2,What?? I can't hear you,"Sure, this trainer was super easy to set up but HOLY GODS is it LOUD!! Had I known that it was going to be as loud as it was I would have sprung for the Magneto. I've already decided to return it and I fully believe that if you want a good trainer that you can actually use when other people are home, Do Not Get This One!"
5,Cool,"I live in NSB, fl and this book is perfect. Gives you all the ideas you need, you just have to bring your creativity and patience. It's something you learn to do in time."
5,Can't beat it for the money.,"This cooler is about the best I've had for general use. It keeps ice for multiple days, has a good amount of space inside with a good flat usable area. The plug is ok, but I normally insert another plug on the inside just in case. The drain plug is in a good spot and functions well. Carry handles are fairly solid and should last for at least as long as the plastic hinges. The tow handle and wheels are in a great position. It makes rolling the cooler much easier. You can go through doors with ease, pulls behind you easily is fairly durable for plastic.The only issues are that the cooler has plastic handles, hinges, and plug. This will be where it breaks first. The cooler seems to last about two to three years before any plastic begins to break (possibly, shorter with heavy use). Hinges seem to be the first to break, so watch out for that. For the money, you can just buy another.I would recommend this one to anyone."
4,ice chest on wheels,ice chest worked well. took it to the beach and it held ice and beverages well. only draw back is if fully filled it is very heavy.
3,Good insight into a young Thomas Hardy,"This novel provides insights into the young Thomas Hardy, and portends the great things to come. The plot is flawed and probably influenced by his early need to ""go commercial"", with a quick unveiling of scandal at the end.The characters are not as well defined, and the writing not as pithy as in his later prose and poetry, and his literary allusions fall somewhat out of context.Yet it is a good effort for a young architect in his early thirties who has many great novels to come!"
1,Q Tips Have Changed! Far Less Cotton,"Sometime in the past year (or so) Q-Tips dramatically changed the amount of cotton on its swabs.They have probably 1/3 to 1/2 the amount they did previously. I used to be able to 'twirl' a tip counterclockwise against a terry towel to ""puff it up"" and get more absorbancy. Not any more.These have definitely changed into a second-rate swab, and everyone in my family noticed it in our most recent 500-pack.Shame on Unilever!"
2,Q-Tips not what they were,"Alas I concur with many other reviewers. I got some cheap generic swabs from the drugstore that were just awful. Barely enough cotton on the ends to look like a swab, let alone clean anything. So I sprung for a package of 'real' Q-Tips.Turns out the name-brand is only SLIGHTLY better than the generics. Does anybody know of a company that makes quality Q-Tips any more? These are not worth buying, I'm sad to say."
5,like it,"nothing to complain about, the price, the quality and the quantity. just buy it, if you need a lot of cotton swabs"
5,Love this face serum!!!!,"My friend introduced me to this serum years ago. It's amazing! And it doesn't smell, like some of their other products. The price is a bit steep but it keeps my face wrinkle-free. So to me, it's worth the price!"
4,Excelent Customer Service By GlobalPets,Item was sold by GlobalPets. Tank arrived fractured due to shipping. Item could have been packed better to avoid damage. Contacted GlobalPets and replacement tank was received within a week at no extra cost. Good product. Good communications. Great service.
4,A catalog of products liability,Very clever and most enjoyable for anyone who loves Looney Tunes...but where are the Earthquake pills?
4,It's Great Smelling Stuff!!!,"It smells great & long lasting.I have a hard time believing it has that pheromones in it. I say ""Marketing Tool!!"" I boughtit because of the good smell. It's long lasting too."
2,It's ok,"Pretty colour and pic but actual blankie not that soft or nice to touch, feels more like fleece! Costs too much on here for what it is."
5,Excellent resource and helpful CD,"This was a required text for a counseling residency program. Unfortunately, we were notified rather late as to this text being required reading. What a help it would have been to have this compassionate, wise and humane guide prior to seeing clients! I have used Morrison's ""The First Interview"" as a standard; Lukas successfully takes the clinical content and weaves a cogent, structured and narrative means of addressing the first interview without the clinical edge inherent in Morrison. Lukas also includes sections on children and couples. This is a wonderful resource for those entering the counseling profession."
4,book,Interesting book. It should be helpful with lots of tips and ideas. It seems to be written for the lay person which is great! It is in good condition.
5,This book is telling the truth!,"I was trying to help a little girl who was struggling to learn to read a couple weeks ago, when I discovered that she most likely had dyslexia, though she wasn't officially tested. I started searching to try and understand dyslexia, when I found out that I had it myself, and never knew it!When I read The Gift of Dyslexia, I was so amazed at just how accurately the author described what I went through. I've read other people's ideas on what dyslexia is and what causes it. I usually agree with them about 50% or so. I agree with The Gift of Dyslexia nearly 100%!This book has helped me to understand myself so much better than I did before I read it. I used to think that I was nuts about certain things. (Example: I can read and write well, but at the same time, I have difficulty reading and writing, and that didn't make any sense to me.)Anyway, I really recommend this book to anyone searching for answers about dyslexia. It is very enlightening!"
1,Worried!,"As a special education teacher who has worked with children with reading problems for 20 years, I am very concerned with the misinformation presented in the book ""The Gift of Dyslexia"". Mr Davis does not present any research to support his techniques and the ideas he presents further promulgate myths about dyslexia. I was referred to this book by a parent of a student with whom I worked and it very much concerns me that this book does more harm than good. Mr. Davis' techniques are ridiculous to a real reading teacher. Please do not buy this book."
3,"4-star shorts, but we've all seen them.","Don't get me wrong, all four of these shorts are great, but haven't they been released enough? DISORDER IN THE COURT, MALICE IN THE PALACE, SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS, and BRIDELESS GROOM have been released on about fifty different videos, and now on DVD. BRIDELESS GROOM, SING A SONG, and DISORDER have been released in better quality by Columbia once or twice, but Shemp's most famous short MALICE IN THE PALACE is not on any Columbia Tristar collection yet. I like these shorts, but DVD's should be better that videos and need different shorts. After all, Columbia still hasn't released 55 of the Stooges films."
4,Stuck in the garage!,"...and loving it. This is a raw two drummers, two bass and a fuzz guitar attack. Sloppy, head bopping, fuzzed out. Yeah, rock 'n roll garage like it should be: ugly, fun, rocking and full of attitude. Funny and oftimes insightful lyrics. Every guy listening to this is going to relate to the song ""Stupid"" cause we've all been that way about a girl before.It only gets 4 stars cause these guys are SO much better live. The CD doesn't come close to capturing the feal and power of the mighty D'bombs on stage. I saw them with the Sights at the Black Cat in DC. What an excellent show. So if you like Detroit rock like the Stooges, MC5, and hard rocking '60s garage and soul you're going to love this. Interesting and suprising choice in the covers of Brian Enos' ""Kings Lead Hat"" and Robin Hitchcocks ""Executioner of Love"" too. This is some fun stuff and check them out live."
5,"One of the best albums I own to this day, seriously.","If you like the Dirtbombs or music in any way, you'll love this album. If you don't already love the D-bombs, this could be the album to make you fall in love. The music and lyrics and all-around sound have never been better. It's a great album to run to. No matter what your musical preferences I can almost guarantee that just giving this album a listen will make you want to ""start the party"". If I reviewed the tracks off of the album individually, I'd give them each five stars. There aren't good songs and not-as-good songs, it's all great."
2,Great Album Cover,"Once you get past the beautiful album cover and disc, you put on the album and go why did this get released? Mike's leads are aweful. Bruce and Carl sounds good. Al is barely audible. Sadly, you have to believe Carl believed in this project in 1991 and 1992. I suggest looking for the European release of this album rather than getting this U.S release. The Beach Boys actually redid several songs on the U.K. release with better results. Also look for the Summer In Paradise- Live version(recorded at Wembley Arena)found on another compilation. They should have released a ""Live"" Album instead of this one in 1992. Definately a disappointment from the Beach Boys"
3,"Acceptable album, but sadly the last BB studio effort.","Since the late 70s it hasn't been hard to spot a Mike Love-led studio album. Here's one now. Like the underrated MIU ALBUM, this CD has good moments & weak moments. Here, the good moments are the surprisingly decent John Stamos rendition of Dennis' ""Forever"", the happy summer lyrics and harmonies overall; the weak moments include the recycled ""Surfin'"", the lack of presence of Brian (again), the fake drums (remember parts of the BB '85 album?),and the minimal leads by Bruce and Carl. Altho' better than most bands' best, this CD isn't up to snuff compared to the band's history -- nor is it as bad as LOVE YOU, or even as disparate from the ""sound"" as CARL & PASSIONS. Sadly, it's the last gasp from the greatest American pop band ever. Guest producer/composer Terry Melcher pinch hits, to acceptable results."
2,Not what I expected,"Having read several books on this subject matter, I expected THE FLIGHT to provide an in-depth insider's point of view of the events in question. I really didn't learn anything new here. And I agree with the other reviewer who said that this translation is terrible. There are several awkward translations of key terms, such as ""final stop"" for ""punto final"", the law prohibiting further legal action taken against the military leaders after a certain date. Try Feitlowitz's ""A Lexicon of Terror"" instead."
2,I'm very dissapointed with this pack,"I though I have made a good election but this 2 dvd pack has two lenght episodes but the sound is quite bad is very hard to hear some sentences and the most important the famous theme has been changed by a ridiculous country theme.Gladdly I didn't pick the 5 dvd pack made by the same studio.Don't buy this please,try something else."
5,Fantastic,"Family traditions translate to great foods! Do yourself a favour,read about the families,then the RECIPES. You can feel the culture as you prepare the totally honest recipes.This is a labor of love any cook can appreciate.You will also become a much better cook!"
5,Best Rock Band In Puerto Rico,"I think that sol d' menta is the best band in Puerto Rico because they,do a lot of diferent stuff on their albums(efects,music patterns,latin beats).They deserve more recognition for their work and talents(label manegement,comunication media:television,press,radio...ect)they studied what they wanted to be... musicians.And some times i get mad because people like Fiel a la vega get more expousure whitout having any music talent at all..and even if they sound great IT'S CALLED RECORDING STUDIO WORK PEOPLE.Sol d' Menta its there for the music not the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
3,Interesting.,The story wasn't bad but I never felt connected to the main character. The story moves along at its own pace and you are not pulled into it in depth. After figuring out what Hanna was hiding it then just rambled to the end (and not a good one either). I would check it out at the library instead of buying it.
3,Minimalist but interesting,As with a lot of the novels I've read by Eastern European writers this book does not spend much time on useless adjectives or flowery language. Instead the story is brisk and well formed. Could have used a bit more character development to enhance the psychological drama of the situation (which seemed to be the crux of the story). Overall a good (short) read that hung with me for a few days.
1,Why recommend this book? It's not worthy!,Why Oprah recommended this book is beyond me! This is not a book I liked reading. The main character is an over-sexed teen and later judgement is passed on the ex-Nazi woman he regularly bed down with. She reads in prison... so what! This doesn't make for an Oprah book...one that we should find exciting and well written....that's what I expect from the book club. You bombed here! I want a refund!
2,Definitely not a friendship,"The first few pages of the booked grabbed my attention, but the rest seemed too distant from the beginning part of the book. This is not a story about friendship at all. A friendship is when two people benefit from the relationship. The fact that the child is 15 and she is much older, has nothing to do with my rating. Though I morally have a problem with it, the fact that the ""love"" he felt for her seems to have driven the path of his life bothers me even more. The story isn't very believable. We all remember our first loves, but we do manage to move one. Hanna's character is more believable than Michael's, but it's almost like the book should have been about her past, with which she is obsessed, not about Michael's obsession. I was rather dissappointed in Oprah's pick. Robin, Worcester"
2,and the connection is?,"First of all, I never found any connection between the part of the book where Hanna and Michael are having a deeply sexual relationship and the part where she is on trial. I know that Michael ties it together with illiteracy, but to me that seems weak. I also didn't understand Michael's having an obsession with Hanna, which was not always sexual, for all those years. At the end something did seem to be showing a deeper message but I don't understand it still. The language kind of confused me, but it's really not that difficult. I don't know, see if you can understand this book or just enjoy it."
2,Way too Simplistic,The story never went beyond the surface. It is a quick read but nothing more. There are no moral lessons to learn from this book.
1,Snooze.....yawn...zzz....,"What a BIG disappointment. Boring, redundant, kept waiting for the plot to thicken...I forced myself to finish it, and was relieved when I turned the last page. No clue as to what all the hype was about...snooze city!"
1,A dissapointment,"I was able to get into the first couple chapters but after that I thought the book was very boring. One night I read ten pages and had no idea what I had just read. I have no idea how this book made the Oprah list, because every book I have read from the book club has been great."
1,"Another ""best seller"" that isn't any good. Alas...","Reviews summarizing The Reader made it sound like a good book, but I had to stop less than half way through because it was so uninteresting. Nothing in the development of the characters made me want to find out anything more about them. The ""story"" has great potential but needs a writer who can make it happen. Another ""best seller"" that isn't any good."
1,ABSOLUTELY BORING!!,GAWD WHAT A SLEEPER!! I found myself scanning through in the middle of the book just to get to the end! And why the heck didn't he say anything about her being illiterate!!?? Uh...i don't get it...
1,Distractingly simple,"I began reading this book in a kindof ""captive audience"" situation in which I had nothing else to do for a stretch of time. After an hour, I had already finished a 1/3 of the book. Now, I can't seem to force myself to pick it up again. The writing (perhaps due to the translation) is overly simple. And I don't mean ""simple"" in a poetic way. I mean ""simple"" in a childish way.The premise itself sounds very promising, but I can't get past the writing style. Thinking it might be me, I gave the book to a friend, who also passed it back to me -- not caring if he finished it -- after getting only 1/3 of the way through."
2,A Strange Disappointment,"I have enjoyed reading a selection of books from Oprah's Book Club including Jewel, Where The Heart Is and Black and Blue. However, this book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. I must admit Part Three was the best section of the book. I could never find any ""attachment"" to the characters; could not sympathize with Hannah or feel any emotion toward her or the narrator. All in all, this book was extremely different from all the others."
1,over rated bore,"i read this book because of oprah, i had to force myself to finish it, it was beyond boring!!you knew the big secret from the beginning!!!"
2,"Disappointing and the ""big secret"" is so silly!","I can't decide if I am disappointed that it went by so fast because he could have put in a lot more interesting historical information. Or, I'm glad it was fast because it is so stupid! I expected Hanna's big secret to be something worse than being an SS officer, but it's not. The book is hastily written and there isn't much there."
1,Predictable and boring ....,"After all the hype about this book I expected much, much more. Usually I avoid all ""Oprah's Book Club"" books but I was so interested in a book that would cover the ""digesting"" of the Nazi past in Germany that I picked it up nevertheless. But it lived up to all my negative expectations of an ""Oprah"" book....First I thought it was the translation ... However it is the content that is not developed well or written well. Michael's realtionship with the woman is not believlable which is the center of the story. The reaction to the Nazi years and the Holocaus is superficial, simplistic, ""unimaginative"" and predictable, i.e. he is not writing it any differently than 100s before him. The word ""transition"" has not made it into his vocabulary. Character develelopment is limited. Very quick, boring read."
4,Never a dull moment,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, It was contemplative and very discerning. For those reviewers who think the book was flat and boring and yearn for something more upbeat, try Dr. Suess. The book was not meant to make you smile it was meant to make you think"
3,A roller coaster read...,"Although I found this book to be entertaining, the plot development was rather inconsistently done. At times I felt like the author was rushing through the story and trying to paint the pictures with as few words as possible, and at other times I felt as if the narrative got so detailed that it bogged down the storyline. Overall I felt that it was a good read, but most certainly not the outstanding piece of literature others had claimed that it was."
2,like an English assignment,I found this book to be like an English assignment. It didn't flow from section to section and the characters felt undeveloped. I was disappointed when part one simply ended with Hannah going away. The trial section was equally as blunt. I never felt anything for the main characters.I would not recommend this book to a friend because it didn't seem like a finished product.
4,"Insightful, very well done!","This novel is a sort of combination of ""The Triumph and the Glory"", ""Sophie's Choice"", with a dash of ""Schindler's List"" thrown in for seasoning. Not a real original plot premise, but ""The Reader"" has enough going for it to satisfy most readers. Four stars."
4,What a great short summer read!!!!,"This book is definatly worth reading. It starts out very intersting with the hot love affair, which keeps you turning the pages. The middle did get somewhat boring, but things picked up again towards the end. The ending was vey unexpected!!!"
2,A well written book with no point,In ordinary society there is no such thing as the realtionship that occured between the characters. This book completely lost it from the get go. With a lack of interest I forced myself to finish this composition. The whole plot of the book was way to overwhelming with too much action for the short period it took to read. A mistake on the authors part lead to a boring read.
2,"Boring, horrible ending","Normally while reading a book you are drawn into the characters and sympathize with at least one of them. These character were badly written, you felt that even at the end of the book you knew nothing about them. And the trial, which I suppose was supposed to be the pivotal point in the novel, came from so far out in left field and with no explanation or logic. I felt let down after reading this, especially after all the praise Oprah had given it."
1,Not worth it,"I thought the ""surprise"" toward the end was quite obvious from the very beginning and really not that intriguing. I also have a hard time empathizing with either character."
4,"4 1/2 Stars! A compelling, eloquent, & worthwhile read.","You'll read it in a day & wish it was longer. It has so many different layers (love, tragedy, WWII, the fight of the generation that followed, soul searching, how one's choices shapes one's life-for better or worse, how life is something that happens while you're making other plans) the end result is rich and impacting. Hard to believe it's a novel & not an autobiography. Schlink says things we all feel better than most can express them: ""This is what must happen to old married couples, I thought: the young man is preserved in the old one for her, the beauty and grace of the young woman stay fresh in the old one for him. Why had I not seen this...?"" For me, it just doesn't get much better than this!"
4,A powerful metaphor of the rise of Naziism,"The Reader is a powerful metaphor of the seduction of German youth by the Nazis. In this book, Hanna symbolizes the temptation of the Nazis, offering ""the answer"" to society's problems, in this case Michael's teenage angst. When Michael matures and realizes what Hanna (Naziism) is all about, he is fascinated and tortured by what he had succumbed to in his naive youth."
3,This is an easy book to read with several interesting topics,The characters and scenary will draw you in and the story and deep subject matters will keep you reading. I don't think the relationship between the two major characters is the most important topic here. You will be asking yourself many serious questions while you read this book.
2,Misplaced morality,"I did not like this book, not because of the writer's style, but because of its contents. The protagonist has a moral dilemma because he once loved a woman who became an SS guard during Nazi Germany. This woman was on trial for the atrocities she committed. Since she was illiterate, the argument went, she could not properly defend herself. That sums up the protagonist's moral quandry. I'm reading the book wondering why someone would want to use ANY defense for the monsters of the Third Reich! There isn't a punishment on this earth harsh enough for them. The protagonist once loved this woman, now is trying to say that what she did wasn't as bad as it sounded in court. In my opinion, he is monstrous as well for loving such a cruel person in the first place. He further demonstrates what a selfish coward he is later in the book by how he conducted his marriage. I was generally disgusted by the whole thing."
2,Misdirected Emotion,"""The Reader"" is not an easy read. No tbecause of length or difficulty, but because of disturbing subject matter and because, quite frankly, it is not very well written. Certainly the sunbject of guilt relating to the Holocaust is not new. How should those who stood by and did nothing atone for their silence; even worse, what about those willingly particpated in the atrocities of this dark period. Readers are faced with these issues, but given little to think about. It seems as though we are supposed to feel sorry for Hanna, but I just cannot. She is a reprehensible person; nothing can excuse her actions. Even her affair with Michael is nothing but a confused, ugly woman using a young man. Michael, too, is conflicted many years later when he discovers the truth about Hannah. He is sickened by what he knows, but his character seems to lose strength--in the end, he seems shallow. While the novel hopes to pose serious questions and raise thought-provoking issues, it does not succeed."
1,Could it be ANY slower?,"I have very little free time to read books of pleasure and I am very disappointed that I chose this one to dive into. It was extremely difficult to finish due to the uneventful plot and extremely low character base. Who needs kleenex, try caffeine!!"
2,Well Written,"Highly unlikely. One could tell from the very beginning that this women could not read. I find it suspect that she kept her job. I know this can happen, but a conductor? Also, how strong she was througout the trial, how strong she was in learning to read and be a responsible leader in prison. And then, having gained a semblance of self-assurance, she killed herself...."
4,Interesting book with elegant prose and disturbing plot.,This is an interesting book with elegant but concise prose. The plot could be disturbing to some readers yet I found the both the narrator and his subject fascinating. This book is highly believable and well worth the read.
1,WHAT'S THE BIG FUSS ABOUT HIS BOOK?,"THE STORY IS SIMPLE YET COMPLEX AT THE SAME TIME, BUT IT REALLY AMAZES ME TO SEE HOW A FOREIGN BOOK REMAINS A FOREIGN BOOK EVEN AFTER ITS TRANSLATION. THE REAL MEANING OF THE STORY MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL."
4,"Easy quick read, but not amazing","This is a very quick read book. The story is so-so, but since it is such an easy read you don't care so much. Would I recomend it? Sure, but I am not tempted to see the movie."
4,"A beautiful, haunting story of love and loss...","This novel is a beautiful, haunting story of love and loss that readers won't forget. Part 1 is sensual and honest...poignant and tender. The remaining two parts echo the beginning. The reader goes on a psychological journey through the mind of the narrator as he chronicles his adulthood and the haunting of that life he can't seem to lead. This novel deals with coming of age and the Holocaust in a very different way, and readers will struggle with moral and ethical issues. I could not put this book down...and I read it in one sitting! I highly recommend this book. It's one I will never forget."
5,Wow! A book to read more than once...,"To be honest, I checked out this book from the local library because the initial premise of a 15 year old male seduced by the 30-something old woman was so trashy and unappealling. The book goes way beyond that. It was necessary than the two central characters would actually represent different generations. There is so much here. How can people in a group setting get pulled along to do something they wouldn't ordinarily? At her trial,she was rigorous about truth. So much more. A book worth studying. I ""repent"", and I look forward to purchasing this book for my permanent library"
1,Just potatoes ---- no meat. Disappointing.,"I expected more from an Oprah pick of the month book. There was a beginning and an end, but no middle. I found it boring, but then, I found Bridges of Madison County boring. So if you liked that book, then buy this one."
1,"Tawdry story, poor literature","My son had to read this for an English course, and I read it as well.My verdict: I told the English department to drop it from the syllabus (and they said they would). It's a tawdry story from post-Christian Germany of underage sex of a teenage boy and middle-aged woman (with the kid's parents totally in the dark about their son's life, and how he was being polluted).And what does one get for enduring the depressing tale? There's nothing spectacular from a literary view in the telling of the story, and the conclusion is nothing more than a one-liner punchline.Two thumbs down. I don't recommend it for anyone."
2,What a predictable read,"As one reviewer stated, this is really 4 books. I would give the first 3 1* and the last 3*. Who couldn't figure out early that Hanna couldn't read? Isn't it widely known that when an adolescent has sex with a mature adult, that adolescent will eventually have severe psychological problems? And, I found Hanna's desire to hide her problem at all costs to be unbelievable. And, for someone like Michael who let his life revolve around his affair with Hanna, and then to not ""rescue"" her or contact her in prison, well, it just didn't jell. I just didn't care about the book and I certainly didn't have any feeling for Michael."
2,Good points and bad points.,"The ""Reader"" was the first book i read out of the Oprah Book CLub, and i must say it impressed me enough to read more. However, once i read another from the famed club, i realized this book was only mediocore. It was a very simple read. The kind of book you could put down for a months time (which i did), then come back to it. Now i will say that i couldn't just stop reading the novel, i had to finish it. The first part of the novel was very well written in aspects of storyline. In characterization, it was not all that good. I didn't have any feelings or emotions for the characters, none at all. It was just a simple story to keep me busy when i had nothing to do. Now if you want a REALLY good book for the club, try ""House Of Sand and Fog"", by ANdre DubusIII, that book was an amazing read, however the ending left you hanging and you will want to know so much more about the characters. It was still an extrodinary book!!"
3,Expected more,"I liked the book, it was well written and touching. It's just that I kept reading every chapter expecting a resoultion or something to happen differently, but it didn't ever come. It kind of just leaves us hanging and doesn't tie it all up for us in the end. I just wish things would have ended without the despair and doubt. Does it make it a book that shouldn't be read? Of course not, it is worthy of anyone's time who likes to read. However, if there is something out there you've had your eye on and want to read then get it and read this when you just need to kill some time."
4,tremendous and disturbing,I could't put this book down. The imagery Michael presents of his memories with Hanna--juxtaposed with the realities of who she really was--allows us to consider our own frailties and our own ideas of both who and what we are. What is real? How do we cope? Michael's discussion with a man who justifies his involvement in WWII continues the underlying dichotomy--what is the manner in which we would have behaved under the same circumstances? What would you have done? The moral dilemmas stay with me. The characters and theme are reminiscent of Camus' The Stranger. I was thankful for the sparse yet powerful language. It allowed me to ruminate on what occurred without telling me how. A disturbing and intriguing read.
4,A touching story written in a most poetic form......,"This book spoke to me in a way that few do. The way the author used the language and described certain situations were absolutely relatable. ""The Reader"" should be missed by no one. It's a fast easy read and should be picked up for a beach day book.....it won't disappoint.......kris/nj"
2,Schlink's novel perdictable and rarely 'tackles' the isssues,I started reading 'the reader' with great enthusiam. I found that the writing style was clunky and overly simple. I had trubles reading and continuing to read the book because of this. I thought that Schlink asks many interesting and moraly devastating questions to the character's and to the readers but it never eally answers them. The book is very predictable and overly simple. Skip this one it's a waste of time.
4,The Reader,"The Reader is a captivating story about growing up, falling in love, and finding yourself. Bernard Schlink skillfully crafts this book from the perspective of a 15 year old sickly book that develops a relationship with a much older woman, who has a secretative past. In time this relationship ends, but several years later their pathes cross again and they are in a much different situation where her past plays a factor. Skillfully written book and a must read."
3,A Culmination of Sin,"Bernhard Schlink provides his readers with an interesting story of an ill boy and a sick woman. He uses sex, love, and war to keep his audience attached and reading. He questions humanity with the stories of the Holocaust and love between a 36 year old woman and a 15 year old boy. By attaching the audience to Michael, Schlink shows how it is human nature to forgive the people close to you. I recommend this book if you are looking for a perspective on how post WWII Germans could forgive their families for such attrocities."
1,Did not receive,"Book was sold out. I did not receive the book. However, I was told right away that the book was sold out. There was no problem."
3,The Reader,"Who are the people you meet on the journey through life and how much do you know about them? Here we see a snapshot, a true and lovely snapshot from The Reader's point of view. Then in a shock, the Reader looks into that he never saw. The writing is heavy in the first section and quick and shocking as the Reader takes off the rose colored glasses. We are all human and some of us more human than others."
5,The best Disc !,This cd is wonderfull ! is the best ! i love the laura pausini's music and i can conform that this is her best cd !..
2,Not a good P-51 Mustang combat history book,"I thought it is a combat history book, but disappoint me"
2,Painful,"I love SMAP and everything, but this album is very painful to listen to. It sucks! Very disappointed. Though, I love SMAP and will continue being their fan, but they could have skipped making this album."
5,An Essential Read for Community Developers,"This book is destined to be a classic in the field of virtual community development. Others may expand on the work of Hagel and Armstrong, but most important things community managers need to know are contained in Net Gain."
2,Way too hypothetical,There are a few good concepts here upon which the authors have built a whole hypothetical model. But they do not seem to have enough data to build the model on. It's like a whole big six-ton sand castle built up to the sky resting on two toothpicks and a wad of chewed-up bubble gum.
2,Repetitive and Stale,Book could be effectively summarized in 10 pages with examples. I expect more content and better editing from HBS.
5,Best type of bike trainer.,"The Fluid bike stand provides much more functionality than the magnetic ones. I highly recommend these types, and I've not had any issues with the model. It's easy to assemble and use."
4,Spinning my wheel,"Just a suggestion to watch the instruction video for assembly (on the Cycle Ops website) rather than try to figure out the paper instructions, which are inscrutable. Following the video, it was easy for me (mechanically challenged) to assemble. I am not not a super-serious cyclist, but I did a lot of research because I wanted to keep spinning throughout the winter. It is quiet and gives me a good workout, just difficult to stick with for more than 35-40 minutes even with the TV or Netflix on. Very satisfied."
5,Well made in the USA,I looked at several brands of bike trainers. I narrowed it down to two brands. One brand was made in China andthe CycleOps is made in the USA. I chose the CycleOps because it had good reviews and is USA made. It was easy to assemble and is well made. I get a very good workout in just 30-45 minutes.
3,Great while it lasted,"So my fluid trainer is a couple of years old now. For the first couple of ""off-seasons"", I really enjoyed it. But it slowly grew noisier. Finally, just a couple of days ago, I burned out the chrome cylinder that the rear wheel rides on. Come to find out, that I know of one other person that had this identical problem! Like I said, mine is a couple of years old (so was my friend's) so maybe the problem has been identified. Another friend has one that is less than a year old but he's gonna sell it to me cause he never uses it...hopefully it lasts longer than mine did! For the time that it worked, my trainer was really great...just expect more that a couple years from a trainer that cost me $300.Good luck!"
4,NO MORE EXCUSES :),The best exercise equipment I have invested in so far. I finally had a chance to use the trainer and was very happy with the results. The only problem I have with trainer is that it is very noisy when you start pedaling so I turned up the TV to drown out the noise. I hope my neighbors do not start knocking on the ceiling from all of the noise. I recommend to not ride very early in the morning or late at night. The set up was easy with the help of the on-line set up video from the company web site. I finally may get back into the clothes I put in the back of my closet if I use the trainer daily. No more excuse to those who can not make it to the gym for a good cardio routine :)
4,a good item,a good item. But it has a short using date. It will be expired soon. So you must use it up as soon as possible.
4,Great facial cream.,"For several years now I've been fighting acne, the products that have helped me proactive, but the unfortunate part of using these products ""dry skin"" starts to appear and I also noticed my skin wasn't looking healthy, so I decide to change it up and start using Olay complete moisture cream and I tell you within a week my skin has been looking healthy and acne has been under-control. And skeptic just give this cream a try it can improve your skin for the better. I will be trying out the night cream soon."
3,Much like the rest in series with sci-fi,My children like it. It has a little too much sci-fi for me with a scary monster that Eugene created.
1,Didn't like it,"I bought this for my 3 year old.Its a cool concept, but good luck building anything over 1 story.The magnets buckle like a house of cards and fall."
3,Slow at first....,"This novel seems to be two books. The first half was a bit slow. I kept thinking that this needs to pick up some pace. Not much by way of character or plot development. I toyed with putting it down.But then I hit a part in the book where things began moving quite nicely. To be honest, I went back a few pages and re-read, fearing that I'd missed some transition - the difference was that apparent.By the end of the book I was enjoying the characters and twists the author threw in. There were a few gaps in the action (things where you think to yourself...'I'm not really sure it would happen that way'), but all in all this was a decent book. If the first half had been better I would definitely recommend. As it stands now, I'd say read Perry's novel ""Pursuit"" - it's much better."
5,The Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bar has ...,The Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin Bar has helped my skin tremendously. The soap lathers nicely and has no perfumes. I would recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a light soap for sensitive skin.
3,tarzan,reliving my youth as it's been years since i read any of the tarzan books. With the large selection I can find new ones now.
4,"""Journey ..."" holds up quite well!","Over the decades, I have read ""Journey ..."" a few times. Despite the years since it was written, it holds up quite well as a fantasy / Adventure! It is an enjoyable book and I think today's teenagers would like it."
4,Journy to the Centre of the Earth,"Is it possible to get to the centre of the earth without burning to a crisp? Hans, Professor Lidenbrock, and Axel attempted it. They used science, strength, and logic to navigate through the the subterranean maze of tunnels, caverns, seas, and volcanos. I recommend this book to people who want to learn about geology, paleontology, and physics while reading a exiting fantasy and adventure book."
4,Old but still good,"The science is old and outdated. The book is still Verne's greatest (although I have yet to read many). This book is the ancestor to modern SF, and it is not encouraging to see many disregard it and consider it junk. It is old and hard to follow, but it is still one of the best."
5,"If you own Rick Wakeman's Piece, You gotta have this.","Go get the music CD ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"" by Rick Wakeman right after you read this great little book by Jules Verne. You won't be sorry."
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"I enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth a surprising amount. Before finally reading this unabridged version, I had become very familiar with the basic plot by reading an abridged version several times in childhood. That (10 made me aware of the novel's obvious flaws, such as the wimpy narrator, the preposterous science, and the sudden ending, and (20 seemed to assure that I could not be surprised by much in the story.But I was. The premise and story were just as ridiculous as I expected and the characters were sort of cartoons, and I loved it all anyway. there's an undeniable charm, and even humor, to Verne's narratives and to his narrative voice, and the sillier the novel was this time, the more I enjoyed it. The ending is still a little too easy for my tasted, but I was also just sad, at that point, that the quick-paced ride was ending. I doubt that I will understestimate a Verne novel again."
2,Slow,"My parents recommended this book for me to read, but the story is painfully slow and I just couldn't feel a connection with the characters."
4,Interesting but lacking,"After reading Around the World in 80 days, I was expecting another good work from Verne. This story had several good points to it, but also had points where the plot seems to drag on with unnecessary dialogue or other information. My only complaint is it is too lengthy. The adventure is interesting but lacks the excitement Around the World on 80 Days had."
3,Sci Fi Standard,"It was ok...a little disappointing, really. Seemed to end very abruptly and I can't find it in me to like or even sympathize with Axel..."
4,Where is the balance?,"This is a great book---very inspiring, uplifting and affirming. The authors get it right.My only question is: where is the balance? We need feminine and masculine energies to balance us, especially since we contain both qualities. God does not only have a feminine face and the authors know this, however I would have enjoyed reading about the balance between the two. We need to bring out both in ourselves.Nice work, authors! Now, write a book about the balance."
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this product. My husband works in labor and this was definately not the rain suit for him. This is for light use only. Had no problems with the company though. Fast shipment
4,Stephanie Hoppen's Decorating with Style,"I am a big fan of both Kelly(daughter, In Touch/East meets West) and Stephanie Hoppen. I think this book was very informative and I will definitely be using some of the tips from the book very soon!"
1,"Badly formatted DVD. Half the movie on one side of disk, half on the other!!",Half way through the movie it stopped. You have to turn the disc over AND miss content in order to watch the rest of the movie. VERY disappointed with this. Ruined an otherwise great movie. Would not recommend it to anyone. Does not meet expectations.
5,Very Well Done.,I don't get how the initial review of this movie refers to it as a homophobic revenge. What is homophobic about being raped as a child? They didn't revenge on these guards because they were homophobic. It had nothing to do with the story. These people were getting revenge on people that took their innocence away as the movie clearly portrays. This homophobic garbarge needs to stop.Sorry that just pissed me off.Whether or not the story is true or false is left up for questioning.The movie was superbly acted and should be watched whether or not the story is true and shouldn't effect the reasoning to see or not to see the movie because if it didn't happen there is no reason to think it couldn't have in some form.
3,"Entertainment, but oscar-less for a reason","Truth be told, I did like this film, as big-budgeted and as calculating (towards Academy voters) as it might have been. The performances all around are fantastic, with the exception of Brad Pitt, who's decent, but doesn't have much to sink his teeth into.The biggest problem with this film is that a much lower-budget Canadian film called 'The Boys of St. Vincent' was released the previous year or so, and it's vastly superior, not to mention truly controversial. Because there's some question as to how much of 'Sleepers' is based on truth, the film suffers; the actors seem as though they'd be more convincing if THEY themselves were convinced of the veracity of the script.But it's quite enjoyable to watch, and more than worth a rainy-day rental. Kevin Bacon especially should have at least received a supporting cast oscar, as a truly slimy prison guard."
4,A feel good movie.,"This movie is depressing, dark and a real eye-opener. Good cast, and good court-room drama. A strong cast and solid performances make this movie a must watch."
1,movie went black half way through Sleepers DVD,shipping time was good movie was great but went black half way through and that was it !!! u wrote the seller no responce??? Sleepers DVD
5,You simply have to see it!,"This is one powerhouse of a film! It has some of the most excellent performances ever captured on film, and it is a wonder to watch! Although disturbing, this is a film that everyone needs to see. It has a strong message and will haunt you long after it has ended. Buy it. You do not want to miss it!*Parental discretion is advised. Contains mature subject matter.*"
3,"The movie is awesome, the disc is not.","Bought this a while ago. Arrived on time and in good condition. The deal breaker was that I had requested a DVD that came in a regular DVD case. This particular movie arrived in one of those cardboard ""snap"" cases. I HATE the snap cases. Also, the DVD needs to be flipped over mid-movie in order the watch the entire movie. That was the first time I've ever encountered that with a DVD. So while the movie is excellent, the snap case and the fact the DVD needs to be flipped is a deal breaker. That's why I've given it 3 stars instead of 5."
3,It wasn't the greatest!,My name is Lisa and I'm 17. I have read almost all of R.L. Stine's books and this one was a real let down. I think he should of put more scary things in it then just cats following around some kid. I liked the idea of the cat getting revenge after Marty killed him though. Even still it needed something alot more scarier to happen.
3,A welcome return and a courageous effort by Reeve...,"I think Reeve chose the best vehicle possible for his return to acting and his performance, as well as that of his co-stars, is to be commended."
2,It wasn't very good,"hitchcock's version was alot better. The new one is just too hi-tech. If your gonna see one, see hitchcock's version"
2,"ok, as far as movies go","I do not know how any one could remake the classic Hitchcock movie! I saw one with Elizabeth McGovern and Steve Guttenburge years ago and this one falls into that catagory! Where is the original? will it ever be re-released? why own this when you rent the original from Blockbust and really enjoy it, but I want the original for my movie collection! Does anyone know where we can by it? you know the great one? Christopher Reeve plays the part great but Darrel Hannah in the part of Grace Kelly? I think not!"
1,Who really likes this movie?,Who can really like this version better than the Hitchcock one? how on earth is that possible! Please people if your going to watch Rear Window watch the 1954 version. That one rocks ten times more than this one. It was a good try but....Daral Hannah...trying to top Grace Kelly? not possible and not worth the try.
1,Why Even Try to Re-make Hitchcock's Version!,I was flipping channels in my appartment when I came across this if you can even call worthy of a movie. My question is why do movie studio's even try to remake classic film's. This wasn't even worthy in my book to be called the re-make of 1954's award winner Rear Window.
4,Give this movie a chance!,"I have been a fan of Christopher Reeve since the ""Superman"" days, and I think he is a wonderful actor. ""Remakes"" are usually dissapointing, but If people would STOP thinking of this as a ""remake"" of a Hitchcock's classic, then maybe they could open their eyes and really enjoy this movie. It shows the tremendous courage and spirit and of this fine actor. He is an amazing man, who doesn't give up, and has overcome many obstacles to act again. This movie shows you some of the difficulties and emotions he must have dealt with as a quadriplegic. Watch it with ""new"" eyes and you will enjoy this movie. I have read his book and his story is truly amazing, he deserves much better credit for what he has achieved!"
1,a disGRACE,There is only one Rear Window and that is Hitchcock's 1954 version with Grace Kelly and the irreplacable Jimmy Stewart. Why remake a flawless classic? Reeve and Hannah aren't even in the same league as Kelly & Stewart.Senseless in my opinion.
3,"Loved the orginal more, BUT......","I am a huge fan of Rear window, I loved the classic and have watched my own copy until it died. So I was not sure if I wanted to really see this remake; but my love of Chrisopher Reeve convinced me it would be a shame to miss it. I am so glad I didn't, while I still think the orginal is better, it was so wonderful to see Mr. Reeve in front of the camera again. I still held my breath when the bad guy went after him, and sighed with relief when he, and his lady love, lived to tell the tale. Your really can NOT ask more than that. If Rear Window HAD to be remade you couldn't have asked for a better actor to take over the Jimmy Stewart role.I will miss Mr. Reeve, but his work does go over well here."
4,Solid Prog Album,"A band's debut album is very telling. They've been working on this material throughout their existance and probably half of these is what was pitched to the record label that signed them. Good news is that liked it enough to sign them. ""Prog"" is a popular genre right now in hard rock and metal so didn't know what to expect. I got a mature sounding album with heavy Rush influences, but definitely not a clone or a cheap imitation. This album has it all, heavy in spots and slow and mid tempo in others with great transitions. I've listened to it three or four times now, each time I'm finding new things to like about each of the songs. If you like hard rock, progressive rock or good musicianship, I think you'll like this album. For under $8.00, I believe it's a steal."
3,Okay,"This cd was okay. It was amusing to hear the boys when they were younger but I think it lacked. It's a great addition if you're just buying everything Hanson, but don't expect much."
5,Cool!,I loved this cd right from the start. It's so cool to hear Hanson talking on your headphones. Hanson fans: This cd is a must have! No Hanson fan should be without it
5,Love it,"I ordered this for our laundry room for those items I don't want to dry. usually they are t-shirts & cami's. I absolutly LOVE it. While i wouldn't hang 5 large rugs on it(although I have hung one or two smaller ones with no problems).....it certainly fits my needs. My husband mounted it on the wall & I stretch the cord out & it holds everything I have ever hung on it...10 t-shirts, cami's, bras's & even a couple sweaters. It is securely ancored at both ends & I retract it when I am finished. no problems so far...."
2,Imitation Nabokov,"I found this perhaps Updike's worst novel, because here, rather than writing as John Updike, he makes an ill-advised attempt to become Vladimir Nabokov. This novel reads like what a college English major might produce just after they had read LOLITA for the first time. Updike's Marshfield is a pallid Humbert. The effort, to reach for what Nabokov did with LOLITA, is transparent. Updike's attempt to be arch, witty, and erotic, like the earlier book, is clumsy. This novel is embarassingly derivative. If you want real Updike, try THE CENTAUR, or the Rabbit series."
3,Lacks definition,"I ordered this madonna for a Christmas gift. Beautiful but it lacks definition. The size of the medal is good and the bail isbig and permits to wear it on a bigger chain or a silk cord, with is beautiful. Medal arrived before due date and in good condition."
1,uses small volume ink cartridge,"I had almost decided to buy this printer (or the 3745 model that includes the black ink cartridge too) until I started comparing ink cartridge volumes. I'm replacing my HP660C that lasted a little over 10 years...a wonderful little printer. Its cartridge (black) holds 40ml of ink and costs just under $30. This printer's cartridge holds just 10ml and costs just under $20. I'm going to keep searching for an HP printer that uses ink cartridges 26 or 29, both of which hold 40ml."
4,Mostly great for the initial cost,"I think it was $39.96 at Walmart. We have used for over a year. Quality is good, speed ok, all-in-all, mechanically speaking, a good buy. HP apparently engineered it to accept only low-capacity, fairly high priced cartridges. A machine at my work is designed to accept the #27 (3740's specified black cart.) AS WELL AS THE #56, just a few dollars more with MUCH MORE INK. You can't win----buy a pretty good copier for little money and give the savings back if you buy the manufacturer's brand of ink. We have always been afraid of the refill/store brand stuff so I can't comment on that method of beating the system."
2,paper jam,"Paper jam, every time. It's pretty amazing, this printer can suck in 10 pages at a time, not 1 page at a time, as a printer is suppose to. It jams half way, all the way, one page, two pages, 10 pages. So many variations- just to screw your day.Don't get it."
5,Have always loved this item!,"My partner and I already have this utility knife, however, the fact of the matter is that you can never have too many of them. My sweetheart does most of the cooking and I do most of the prepping. We are constantly cutting and cleaning this knife throughout the cooking process and so I am getting her a brand new one for Christmas (so she no longer has to share)! I recommend this knife to anyone serious about cooking. It sharpens perfectly and its comfortable handle makes mincing and chopping a sinch!"
3,Funny,"Ray of Light is a great song, but Madonna simply does not have the vocal range to pull it off. Its funny and endearing when she tries her best to hit the high notes and hits her vocal limit instead."
2,Black & White Comic Book Characters,"If I wrote anything like this with the ""colors"" reversed, I'd be a racist! All the bad people are ""white"" and the ""black"" people are beautiful and good. No shades of gray here.And such moralizing! My gosh, I sure am glad that cops are not such prudes in the real world. 50% of people have smoked MJ, and that's 50% of cops too. But certainly NOT our heros here!Any woman worth her salt should obviously be a spitfire - the heroine smashes Duck in the face with her fist as hard as she can when she finds him?Is there anyone who read this who didn't forsee that Duck was on the trail of bad reefer? Other than the heroine, that is. Why doesn't law school and 7 years as a cop doesn't translate into at least some ability to ""detect""?I'm really sorry to all you fans. Obviously you loved having such perfect idols (or something). But not one of these characters reminded me of any real people I've known in the real world. Real people - whatever their color - have good AND bad."
1,"zero, Zero, ZEro, ZERo, ZERO Stars! OMG!","Wish I could have given it zero stars. This program froze up both of my computers (the laptop and the desktop). I configured and reconfigured again and again, but to no avail. As far as scanning goes, it scanned the laptop (before freezing) but it would not complete a scan on the desktop (then it froze). I did a hard shut down on both computers and then booted them up again, only to freeze after the first ten minutes. This was a waist of my money (and time). Oh, and when I tried to contact ZoneAlarm (they have this funky 'live chat that isn't live chat' thing and then it told me to email them). So, I emailed them and wait, no response. I emailed them a second time and waited 3 maybe 4 days. They gave me a list of things to do and undo and do again. FORGET ABOUT IT!!! Done, done, and done. Just give me my money back and I'll forget I ever met them.**but I forgot, I can't get my money back, what a trip**.Good Luck to anyone who is BRAVE."
1,Don't waste your time,"I installed this on three computers, my desktop, my laptop, and my wife's desktop. It slowed my desktop to the point that I couldn't use it. Slowed the others quite a bit. Emailed customer service, they suggested that I clear all start up programs to determine if one had a conflict with Zone Alarm. Hey I already knew what the conflict was it was zone alarm, so I un-installed it and everything worked fine. I have used their firewall for years and loved it. Apparently they have overloaded this suite with to much stuff. Don't take the chance to waste your $s on this"
1,ZoneAlarm HIJACKED My PC!!!,"My search continues for an antivirus program that doesn't behave like a malicious virus itself. I have time to write this review because Outlook is auto-archiving the folders that were damaged while ZoneAlarm was at work. This program slows my computer down to a crawl, often having me wait for 10 or 15 minutes while the PC is frozen. Is there ANY antivirus program out there that doesn't behave like a virus?! ZoneAlarm ISN'T it!!!Help!!!"
1,Stay away from ZA Internet Security Suite 2007,"The 2007 ZA ISS (3 seat license) is causing my computers (XP, Pentium 4, 2 gig RAM) to start much slower, perhaps by another minute or two. What's worse is that my computers now take over 10 minutes to shut down (and sometimes doesn't shut down at all)!!!!! It used to take about 20-30 sec before with the 2006 version. I now regret buying this POS."
4,MS Press does it again,"If you have been through one of these books before, this one is much the same: Mostly straight-talk of skills and knowledge needed to pass the exam.The e-Book (PDF format) is a treat as I don't have to lug the bulky, heavy book around; just my laptop.The only thing that gets me about these books is they are really un-interesting. Yes there are plenty of activities and such, but I guess my expectation is more straight-to-the-matter and perhaps more real-world examples.If you are looking to prepare for the 70-294 exam (and you are not looking for the Server 2008-series exams) consider this book as a PORTION of your training tool set. I HIGHLY recommend configuring a mid- to high-level laptop with virtual PC or VMware Workstation to set up your environment."
4,Decent,"Well, I waited and waited for this book to come out. When I first bought it, I was quite disappointed in the material presented within. Where were all the cool spells that aren't in FR or D&D 3.5? What about the other races, better statistics on the gods?So I took my time to read and re-read the book. Well, I've gotten used to it and have found a lot of useful info for running a campaign. Kind of like that cd you buy where it takes listening to it a few times to like it.I would still recommend going to the unoffical Dragonlance website because it has a lot more useful info than this book. But I still give this one my recommendation.Oh yeah, the biggest disappointment: No Fold-Out Map! It has been put on the WOTC website for download, but it doesn't make up for this book lacking one. They should have released a map with the Dragon magazine to make up for this."
1,Not Really Worth it...,"I love Dragonlance...let me say that first and formost. However, I think they forgot a few things in this book. Some of the dwarven and elven histories are changed and you aren't really given enough info on alot of other races and classes of Krynn. Minotaurs are included under the ogre heading and thier history is very limited. I think Margaret could have done a much better job if she had broke the book down in order to actually give the players more information. If you already have D & D Monsters Manual and the Players Handbook, this book isn't even needed to play in Dragonlance.I caried my book back for a refund.."
5,Great setting for a great game,"Compared to many source books and campaign settings this one stands out. If you're a fan of the series, or just looking for something different to spice up your game without turning to overused settings like Forgotten Realms and Eberron, then this is the setting for you.And who wouldn't like this book? Well, anyone who dislikes fighting dragons while on dragonback, anyone who thinks that mages all draw thier power from the same source (these people would want to play in the Post-Chaos era), and well basicly anyone who doesn't like Dungeons and Dragons.It's co-written by Margrt Weis, one of the original authors and the creators of Krynn (the Dragonlance world) so you know all the information is correct. This book is best used with edition 3.5, but can be adapted (if you know what you're doing) to work with 4th edition.Again, this is a great source and setting worth anyone's time. And by Reorx's hammer don't let the kender near it!"
2,Dissapointed :(,"I was desperate for relief when my milk came in and I was dealing with engorgement. The concept behind these is great and I really really wanted to like them, but no cigar. They don't hold heat or cold for very long, but worst of all they are absorbent. They are full of all natural good stuff I am sure, but as soon as your huge swollen melons leak all over them they turn into bags of mushy oatmeal, and when that dries they are very... crunchy. You obviously can't wash them so they are ruined.Not very practical but oh well. I still haven't found anything that helps with engorgement significantly besides a good sleeping nursing bra, It's just something you have to get through. It does end though, I promise!"
1,Not for me,I found the material to be itchy and uncomfortable. The design did not work for me. I bought the similar product from bamboobies and like those much better.
3,They Have Several Uses...,"I have only ended up using these for my breasts a few times. They are a bit awkwardly shaped for practical use. I couldn't really get them to stay on, but they do feel good when you are really in pain. What I use them for now is to warm up the bassinet before I put the baby in it. I microwave them and put them in her bassinet to warm the sheets where she lies. Then I remove them before I put her in. The difference in temperature doesn't wake her when she goes from my body while I nurse her off to sleep, then into her bassinet."
2,Not great,"Not only do these not get very cold, but they don't even stay cold for 5 mins when you use them. I would not recommend these for cool relief. I haven't tried them for heat yet which is why I didn't give them 1 star"
5,A Fabulous Collection of Celeb Photos,"Photographer Stephen Mosher may have started out his sweater photographs as a lark that turned into a project to raise money for AIDS, but the ultimate product is a beautiful collection of photographs that everyone should have on their coffee table. Mosher has a great eye for setting a photograph and he also captures the essence of each celebrity, whether madcap, dramatic, or touching. And it is certainly not your typical Celebrity photo! Mosher's anecdotes and commentary that are inserted throughout the book are also charming and eloquently written. I was swept away by the photographs in this book and everyone I have shown my copy to has wanted to buy it - what better recommendation can you ask! A great gift book, especially for Christmas."
5,Recommended,"I love these products, i have just started purchasing some of Le Creuset casseroles and am very close to having all I need. I love the color, they clean easy, are very versatile (all stove tops, oven, fridge). I am looking forward to having my complete set for a long time."
4,I love durex...so does she!,So far the size and feel are a pefect match...I'm about to purchase my third set. I don't why everyone doesn't buy condoms this way. Purchasing at walmart is for beginners.
4,Using Disney's Movie vs/with the Book,"Being a great classic it does come with some lines that may be a bit too accurate for some kids' taste. Like ""They had sharp pins...to stick in the bull"" ""long spears to stick in the bull"" ""a sword...to stick the bull last of all."" One alternative (or to go with the book) is the Disney short film. It almost follows the book word for word except for the lines mentioned above. it's very good and funny. You can find the film on the Disney DVD titled THE RELUCTANT DRAGON. This DVD also has the story of Goliath II and Johnny Appleseed."
4,Ferdinand is funny,I purchased Ferdinand the Bull because I remembered it from my childhood. I wanted to read it to my grandsons because things are not always what they seem.
5,Ferdinand the bull,"the book and the cd were in good shape and the story wassimilar to the one i knew when i was a child but not thesame. i was looking for a copy of the one i knew in theearly 50's, it was fun to listen to and it was funny.there is another story of the flying mouse at the sametime, that i am looking for."
5,Dance Club Classic,"This practically unheard mix of Jody Watley's ""If I'm not in Love"" by Dano & BK is a true dance classic. It's a crime the initial CD release was limited only to Japan. The Lenny B mix (edit) is equally worthy."
5,Hard to find!,"I can't find these tasty green apple frogs very often, but now I can just order them from Amazon. I love these - no fat and real taste!"
2,Disappointed,I read the book and was disappointed in the content. Didn't say anything I didn't already know and wouldn't have bought it if I'd had a chance to check it out in a book store.
5,More than we expected,"Despues de años esperando un 3 cd de Fiona Apple por fin lo tenemos! Me sorprendio lo positivo que suenan las canciones. Acostumbrados a escuchar esas quejosas Never is a promise,Criminal y Limp, Extraordinary Machine suena un poco más como Paper Bag.... conservando esa ironía entre el ritmo y las letras.Me encantan las rimas, las palabras que usa y la forma en que se encadenan a la música, y creo que eso es lo que caracteriza a Fiona Apple... así que este nuevo cd mantiene todo eso que ya habíamos escuchado pero con un toque más de ingenio en las letras , sonidos más complejos, y la voz de Fiona apple mucho más pulida.EXCELENTE se los recomiendo a todos aquellos que estén buscando un cd diferente."
3,Overall the product was satisfactory. I would not ...,"Overall the product was satisfactory. I would not agree that it offers 24-hour protection. Even in the cooler fall/winter months, the product started to lose its effectiveness after 10-12 hours. The scent was above average. I personally feel that gel products go on better and offer better protection. They should produce the product with a tamper-proof seal (under the top). I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's simply """"average""""."
2,Grow Up - Bill !,"Apparently , the author has not written a book on TQM - rather - has carried out an exercise in narcissism . His blatant disrespect for the thoughts of others first made me angry - but now I pity him ! He hasn't understood the works of any of the other Quality practitioners AT ALL !"
2,Not that Great,I enjoy all things about the Royal Family however this book tends to delve more into what happened with Charles and Diana and not about William there are some wonderful pictures but i lost interest after the third chapter and gave it to my local library.William : HRH Prince William of Wales
3,Its a'ight for you wanna be thugs,"The CD has potential ,but it's to much thuggin going around in hip-hop. The kidd got madd ryhme skills, but all of his songs talk about what a thug he is. I'm not hating on you thugs (laughing to myself) out there, but get real.... please! I bought it and I'm putting it with my collection of Thugged-Out-Mc's.oNe"
4,This cd is amazing!,"Beanie Sigel is an excellent rapper. He flows well and every song on this cd shows that. Unfortunately, the best song on the cd is the first one. The Truth, produced by KanYe West is an incredible song with an amazing beat and Beans flowing so well that you wouldn't even think it was him. Every song after that one is pretty good as well. Who Want What, Raw & Uncut feat. Jay Z is another good one, and Mac Man is also very good. If you like the Roc, you should buy this, and also if you like gangsta rap you should get this."
5,BEANIE IS THE TRUTH,I have waited a long time for his album to drop now it has have to say it is mad tight.. This cat can flow .. Beats and Rhymes are on point.. The only down side is Jay-Z annoying track Anything.. A strong message cut but the hook is very annoying.. another Broadway hook ladden song..HOT TRACKSThe TruthRaw & UncutRemember Them Days ( Feat Eve)Mac and Brad( Feat Scarface)PICK IT UP HIP HOP HEADZ
3,outstanding,"I remember hearing Playa with Jay and Amil on this a long time ago, but just got to hear the whole album recently. its hot"
2,"anything, anything","The only great song on Sigel's debut album is performed solo by his mentor. ""Anything"" is notable not because Jay-Z swiped another hook from a musical waif -- Annie, meet Oliver -- but because it captures Shawn Carter in a rare moment of magnanimity. His thug vernacular and street cadences play against type to sweeten his pledges of love to his friend, mother and nephew; with his personal marketing energy focused on three other people, the song transcends literally as well as figuratively. Charming as anything. All of which is beyond Sigel. Not that his street scenes aren't ""true"" or his delivery isn't hairy enough, but he can't even transcend his material enough to impose narrative on it; I get the feeling his audience isn't thugs so much as the comfortable consumers who get turned on by the mere mention of thuglife. How hard you're hit by ""Die"" (as in 99 ways to) depends on how long it's been since you've seen a shooting on the news."
4,Kwan is improving:),"This new album from Kwan is really good, although it lacks the explosive energy of their previous one. But still, 13 excellent songs out of 14 tracks is a good score. And this in an album worth listening to. This Finnish band is not very known abroad, but by all rights they should be, and I hope they will be as well.Although the songs get a bit repetitive, they're perfect for the rar+rock+pop feeling you sometimes get. Original, different and entertaining. Well worth your money."
3,The Boring and Damned,"This book really wasn't that great. It was slow and hard to get into. Many incidences were repetitive and the book was a whole lot of nothing. The ending was a let down, and I grew to have a strong feeling of contempt for many of the characters. If you like Fitzgerald, stick with the Great Gatsby or Tender is the Night. Otherwise you'll find reading this book is boring and you'll be damned to want to finish it."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"Their is no action, the characters are boring, self absorbed snobs. By the end of the book I wanted the two main characters to kill one another. I would have settled for murder suicide. Fitzgerald did not even deliver that. I hope I don't download any more Fitzgerald books. This was simply awful."
2,Just okay,"This book was just okay. It was pretty boring until about three quarters of the way through. I will probably never read this book again. It is a little depressing, but you can tell that from the title and I didn't love the style of writing. I do like other works by Fitzgerald but this one I did not care for as much."
4,Give it a read,"Great story, easy to fall right in and lose yourself.Maybe everyone knows a few people like this- that think they are entitled and above and if so their fall is a bit enjoyable."
3,A 3.5,"This book is good because it divides the body up into systems -- the digestive system, the respiratory system, etc. But it's frustrating because the illustrations are a little bit too cartoonish. I can see also that it tries to illustrate that it's depicting separate systems in the body, but you never see how they all fit together. I guess I'm not sorry that I bought it to help my four-year-old understand the basics of how the body works, but it was only really useful in conjunction with other books of the same subject."
2,I didn't particularly like this deodorant. It didn't ...,I didn't particularly like this deodorant. It didn't seem to last all day and I had a hard time telling if I had enough on because it goes on clear. It does stay clear all day so you can wear tank tops without having your armpits all white. That's the only advantage I saw though. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends and family.
3,"Easy to use, goes on smooth, feels dry ...","Easy to use, goes on smooth, feels dry and has a nice fragrance."
4,Love this Item HOWEVER....,I'm on my THIRD one of these because of parts breaking and last night the blasted cooler top broke again ! I honestly LOVE this product despite it's cheap manufacturing and have recommended to many other friends but will also recommend to buy the $3 warranty plan through Babies R Us as well because you may go through a few of them as I have.I also use the Dr. Brown's bottles and concur with many others that all you need to do is unscrew top 1/4 turn and all is well.
5,No Questions...you must have this!!!,"This is one of the greatest inventions ever!!!!!!! It saves time and sanity!! I just drop the bottle in, and usually by the time I'm done changing my daughter's diaper, I have a warm bottle!I am also a Dr. Brown's bottle user. So you have to leave the top off. There is no need to take out the tube as long as the top is off. You just need a place for the air to escape.It is definitely worth the 2 seconds it takes to screw on the top!!"
3,heating times???,"I definately liked the convenience. During the early stages of breastfeeding and we needed to suplement, it was nice to have the bottle there and not have to go downstairs in the middle of the night. However, I've had the hardest time figuring out how much water to use to warm the bottles. They have a chart, but it is not geared towards the platex bottles with the drop ins. It either gets too hot or I have to do it several times until it's hot enough because my guess of how much water to use is always off. HELP!!! I've also got the one without the cooler in my kitchen."
1,Watch out for defect!,"My bottle warmer doesn't always heat all the water, so sometimes there is some that remains in the cup. When more water is added later for another bottle, and the machine is functioning properly, the extra water makes the bottle and milk VERY HOT. After complaining to the company, the customer service department said since my 1 year warranty has expired, there's nothing they will do. Buyer beware."
4,It's a nice heavy duty mat that protects my basement carpet.,I have a CycleOps bicycle trainer. This mat is heavy duty and it's long enough for the entire bike to set on it. It protects the carpet. I even oiled the chain the other day & the few drips from that wiped right up. A bit pricey but is actually a good value versus staining your carpeting.
5,Awesome,It answered alot of questions pertainig to Inuyasha's parents and Sesshomarou's feelings towards him as well. Visually beautiful and a great story line.
3,Okay..,"So I bought this thinking I was going to love. I only like it. Unlike the picture, instead of saying ""evolution"" for the top fish it says ""darwin."" This isn't so bad but its not what I paid for. The second problem is it won't stick to my car. So now I have to find another way to stick it. Once I find a way to finally get it on my car I'm sure I'll like it much more. And from the other reviews, maybe my car fish was just a random mistake."
3,Not up to his standards,"I agree with those that liked the characters of John Walker and Max Stillman as well as the premise of this novel. As the characters worked their way through the puzzle of how somebody was defrauding McLaren Life and Casualty out of millions of dollars the intrigue gets more complex, interesting and very dangerous. However, the answer to the puzzle struck me as so implausable that after following what had become a real head scratching story, I could not help but wonder why the author had chosen to go there. I have enjoyed all of the Jane Whitefield books and am still looking for a copy of The Butcher's Boy, but this book is simply not up to what I have come to expect from this author. It deserves a better ending."
2,Big Disappointment,"The novel begins promisingly enough, but what a preposterous conclusion! As a fan of Thomas Perry's other novels, I can only say that this was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. This is 2/3 of a good book."
2,Undistinguished and uninvolving film,"Sword fighters from around the world, square off every year in the Battle Arena Toshinden, the winner being proclaimed the greatest fighter in the world. Or something of that nature. Unfortunately, the interesting story arch of the tournament has nothing to do with the real story of a super soldier hunting down several martial artists. Impressive battle scenes, with real martial arts choreography are almost forgotten amidst a sea of pathetically dubbed characters (with no personality) as well as a stale script."
3,Weak character development,"Overall, this isn't too shabby of a movie. The action scenes for the most part were well made. However, character development didn't get much past the main character. It is as if they were trying to cram everyone from the game into an hour and a half just to say they were there"
3,5uu's - 'Point Of Views' (Cuneiform) 3 1/2 stars,"Twenty track compilation of 5uu's early recordings. Basically, a good / decent 'progressive / experimental' CD to pop into your home entertainment center whenever you're in a 'certain frame of mind'. Tunes I liked best were the awesome ""Ancient Internationalism"", ""Sporting"", ""Misery Loves Company"" and the rather odd sounding ""Ignominies"". I'm just now finding about the numerous discs that 5uu's has out there and available. Definitely not fo the mainstream at heart."
4,great source,"If you want a source for every angler tecnique around the world, then you have to get this book. Lots of information."
2,No much new,"Well, this is not a BAD book about survival. But the information is very little, could do with a lot more background info.The price is way to hight, probably because it is full of full-color photographs, unfortunally not contibuting at all to the understanding of what is being said in the text.For example the section about medical plants contains only a handfull plants, of which you just have to hope to find them, no information where to find them, and only two photographs, not very clear, which pretty much throws away your chance to realy use them when you need it.For a good survival manual, buy Wiseman's ""SAS survival manual"", which contail all the information in this one, and A LOT MORE, including USEFULL drawings. Even if learning to survive from a book is impossible, it may give you an edge. But don't waste your money on this one."
3,Stick to simple string flossing...,I thought this was going to make flossing easier and faster but that's not the case. The flossing isn't as useful with the lack of power from the device. The picks are not that great either and you will end up spending a lot of money buying refills. At least it comes with a AAA battery.All I can say is just stick to the simple flossing because you will end up spending a lot of money in the long run while not getting that much better of a clean.
2,Dentist says no,"After using this I found out from the dentist it was making my gums red and sore. He told me to stop using it, and get a water pik instead. If you are sore after using this stop using it, the pressure is too strong."
1,"Cute, but...","It's attractive, it has a great name and it's backed by an extraordinary brand. Once you get beyond that, it's just hype. My mother loves hummingbirds and I hate flossing, so I thought this would be a fun gadget to use. Unfortunately, the vibrations don't do as much as proper manual flossing action to clean the spaces between teeth. And if you need/prefer tape-style floss, you're out of luck with this product, which just uses string. It sat on my shelf for months and was used only 3 or 4 times before I gave up. Now I use OralB silk tape or Tom's of Maine tape. Easy, fast, inexpensive and far more effective. Sorry guys; you usually do a good job, but not this time."
2,Hurts my hand,"While the flossing part is good, the machine itself vibrates a great deal. It hurts my hand."
5,Hummingbird Flosser,My husband can't live without them. Hard to find in the stores now - yet they were everywhere a couple of years ago
3,Twain's Youthful Prejudices Showing,"Kinda surprised and disappointed by some of Twain's biased and snarky comments about the various nationalities, cultural practices and religions of some of the countries he visited. Was particularly surprised by some of his dismissive comments about Rome, Florence and Venice. Maybe this is what passed for humor back then, but not my cup of tea. Not my favorite Twain book, by a longshot."
1,My experience with this is product is less than optimal.,"My face is a mass of weeping blisters and the itching is intense. My jaw and neck are noticeably swollen. I wish that I would have read the review of this product on [...] website prior to my purchasing and using the product. How is this product - Just For Men Brush In Gel still manufactured is a mystery. Where's the FDA when you need them? Where are the litigants, because surely someone has sued these folks?"
4,A Good Quick Reference,"This volume provides a good quick reference on the varying aspects and traditions of shamanism. Whilst it doesn't boast the detail of Eliade's Shamanism for example or contain any how to information, it is an excellent introduction for those approaching the subject for the first time. It is beautifully illustrated and does provide enough pointers to guide you in the right direction. It is supplemented by a good bibliography and a list of contacts (although how current the latter are I don't know). Taken for what it is, an introductory text, the book achieves its goal admirably. In my opinion it is also a useful supplement to Eliade by countering the dryness of Eliades text. In summary a readable introduction to the topic."
2,Should be Titled Possessions Part 2,"Not knowing this was a continuation of Possessions, certainly clouds my perceptions of this book. Most authors who write series books refer to characters or events in previous books and if they are any good - they can pull off a stand-alone book, where it doesn't really matter if you've read those coming before (I speak of John Sanford's 'Prey' series as an example). Moore, obviously cannot do this. Very disjointed and dependent on Possessions. You may get more out of this book if you read that one first - but that may be a stretch in my opinion."
2,somewhat dissapointed,"I am a non native speaker of English and when I came to the United States I got a lot of help from a Franklin Speaking Dictionary so I bought the Chinese-English version hoping it will do the same. First I liked the price. Similar gadgets go for a higher price and sometimes do not even have an English manual. The interface was also great then you can switch between Chinese and English. The disappointment came when I tried to use the ""say"" function. It didn't work. Hopefully my case is an isolated one. I think that if it had worked I would have liked this product."
1,Not enough how to.,Thin advice from an expert who wants to stay that way and not share. I could have written a better guide.
3,A well acted movie,"I first saw this movie on video tape 2-6 months after its release in movie theaters when I lived overseas in the 1970's. The movie has its ups and downs and I think hits its peak too soon in the movie (approx 25~45 minutes in). The nudity is a bit too little and the beginning of the rape scene could have been better written and the rape scene itself could have been better shot without all the close ups and the missing part between what happens during the trip from the bathroom to the bed but the story is quite good and dispite it peaking a little too soon (for my tastes) the movie does have some good acting in it. The courtroom scenes is extremely intense, well scripted and acted."
3,"Not bad, but the movie was better","I was impressed with the ""Hollywoodland"" score, but it left me feeling a bit empty. I was hoping that the song playing over the end credits of the film would be included in the score, but it wasn't. After track number 7, all the tracks started sounding alike. I enjoy the CD while driving home from work, as the music is very relaxing. Zarvos is a truly gifted composer, but I was expecting more out of the score."
4,I like it,"I enjoy this CD. Granted, it's not as good as his other compilations, but this is still a good CD. Maybe the bad reviews were just dissapointment from high expectations, and we should have high expectations from DeVito, as he does an excellent job. I do question the first track, the ""In Your Eyes"", as this appeared on an earlier compilation. Also, Ryan Cabrera and Kelly Osbourne seem strangely out of place on the CD.I do have to call out an inaccuracy from one review below: you can download this CD to your computer and your iPod. I don't know what made anyone think you couldn't."
1,Supremely dissapointed,This is a terrible waste of time and money. Don't give these opportunistic people one dime for this shameful piece of work.
3,Good General Advice,"This is definitely a ""starter"" book. It has lots of good overall advice and was full of things to keep in mind when starting a business. I really wanted a book that was a little more detailed and had more information (and examples) about sample business plans or marketing strategies. Although I found the information on copyrights and calculated overhead very useful, I didn't find the rest of the book as informative as I hoped."
5,Outstanding advice,"I loved this book!!!! My daughter's pediatrician recommended the book when I described some of the behaviours she was exhibiting that were a problem. Up until that point I had been following some poor advice from a very popular book called ""Raising your spirited Child"". Once I found Dr. Millar's book our lives changed. We followed the advice and saw a complete 180 degree change in our little girl. Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Millar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Sounds better than it is,"I was hoping to read something I had not read before. Nisker seems to copy every other idea about transformation that is readily available in today's ""journey"" literature. If I had read this in 1990 when it was originally published, I might have been more interested."
3,Deli prices are typically $10 per pound,"It's hard to get as thin a slice at home but it's also quite a luxury to have this on hand. The ham I got resembles the picture's wide end up to the bottom red area beneath the white letters in the photo and is missing the upper protuberance. I got a bit more than 4 lbs and less than 5 lbs.With the $8.75 shipping, this ham is per pound more expensive than delis which slice this for you.Made in USA"
3,Not the same,"I have been a big fan of Bond's for years. However, when good authors take on ""co writers"" I get the idea the co writer does the books. I have seen this with several other Authors. This doesn't even seem like a Larry Bond book. It is worth reading but I wish I had gotten at library rather than buying. I hope Mr Bond goes back to writing books himslelf even in this series. Thanks"
4,Great Trainer.....Great Price,"I have only had one issue with the trainer, my tire slips/spins faster than the trainer at times as I increase my pedaling effort. I need to make a few more attempts at adjusting the pressure as this might be my fault. Otherwise it's been great. Came assembled, very easy to setup and adjust. The adjustable resistance is great. Combined with the 14 speed you get a huge range of resistance from very easy to quite difficult. This is my first trainer so I don't have any baseline to compare it to, but I would recomend this to anyone, especially novice/intermediate bikers who have long, snowy winters to deal with like we do here in Michigan. Great Product!"
2,Item was return,I bought this trainer from Performance bike through Amazon.com but the item was return due to defect and they did not have replacement. That's is too bad.
5,Great Bach Renditions!,"For whatever reason, time has kind of forgotten Narciso Yepes' contribution to the guitar.. He was playing the 10 string guitar before anybody else was using modified classical guitars to play repertoire.... He makes use of the extended range to play these pieces... Great arrangements and interpretations of these Bach guitar works..."
2,Chi Walking not so effective,"I gave this two stars because some of the information is good, however when he tells you to curl your pubic bone up into a C shape when your walking that is not the cue most of us need, infact the tail tucking culture in the West is a major contributor to low back strain. I Think ""8 steps to a pain-free back : natural posture solutions for pain in the back, neck, shoulder, hip, knee, and foot"" is a better choice. It shows pictures of backs of other cultures who have beautiful lumbar curves which are needed to reduce stress as you walk, also you may want to check out Katy Bowmans website ""Aligned and Well"" a great resource for posture. Hope this helps"
5,Chi Walking,Excellent instruction in natural walking techniques that are easy to learn. I felt the increased efficiency and and lower impact on my knee joints almost immediately.
2,Nothing like Beyonce,LONG STORY SHORT: This doll looks NOTHING like Beyonce Knowles! Doll is blonde with blue eyes! What was Matell thinking when they created this?
1,Please do not buy this DVD,"I bought ""Potty Power"" and it keeps a 22 month old interested but I wasn't totally happy with everything about that DVD. As such, I bought ""I Can Go Potty!..."". It does not keep this child interested at all. A child does the talking/explaining which is great. It shows a boy playing with the potty chair with a plush toy and just playing with it in a non-potty way. This may be what happens in real life but no child needs to be shown to do that.Much of the story is of the boy sitting on the chair while day dreaming about going to outter space, under the sea and in the jungle. Do children who are potty training age know about these places even? The alligator is scary, that is so helpful. I sent this back, and I hate to do things like that."
2,"Expensive, short, mildly bizzare","Although friends had reccommended ""Potty Power,"" I bought ""I Can Go Potty"" on a whim when I was running another errand at Borders (sorry Amazon), and could not find Potty Power. I was not impressed by this DVD, and would not recommend it. I would have given it one star, except my daughter kind of liked it.The main part of the DVD is really short. It contains a couple of wierd musical video montages, and the ""potty safari"" mentioned by the previous reviewer. so the actual meat of the DVD is probably 5 minutes long. One of the ""extra's"" called ""Parent's Guide"" was actually video previews. $15 for 15 minutes, two low budget musical montages, a strange off-topic safari fantasy, and video previews? I'm still kicking myself for not just ordering online and waiting a few days for Potty Power."
1,Don't bother with this one.,"I purchased this DVD after I started potty training and that was a big mistake. It may be ok for the very first introduction, but after that it is no good. For one thing, the child in the video is given the potty chair to play with and has it on his head and is using it like a toy which may be well and good when the child has not attempted to use it yet. I stopped showing the video immediately because I don't want my children to immitate the video. I don't allow my boys (twins) to play with the potty chair or toilet, they are for doing your business and that is it. I liked all of the other videos we used (Elmo's Potty Time, Potty Power, I Gotta Go) which were silly and had catchy songs the kids liked."
5,Kurt Nilsen is the artist to watch out for!!!,"I enjoyed this CD very much. Along with that , I discovered that he can able to write his songs and play acoustic guitar very well. A very talented musician.This singer is full of surprises!The cover versions are sung better than the original singers and his penned songs--All that You Offer, Weddings Off and Smell of Roses--are brilliant.His voice can easily sail from low notes to high notes and the words are crystal clear.This CD is worth buying for."
5,Awesome workout tool!,"Product works great on my door! Easy assembly and also comes with a workout chart. Only thing to note ,which is kind of common sense, is be sure the sides of your door have enough clearance as well as your ceiling to do pull-ups."
1,Doesn't Fit the Molding Around the Door,"The pull up bar doesn't fit around the molding/trimming of the door opening, which is about 5"". This is a major design flaw. I'm very unsatisfied and think that amazon should not sell this item anymore."
2,PRISM,This is not what we had expected.PRISM in the title led us astray ~ we thought that it wasconnected to the PRISM books by another author.
5,Wonderful Find,"This book was a wonderful find! As a new hobby, I have taken up wine making. So many books give instructions on how to make various types but none take the time to go into detail as to why certain ingredients are used and needed. I'm only half-way through this book but have a much better understanding and very much look forward to making my first batch."
5,Relaxed as a blog!,"Most reviewers have already described the book, and I agree that's an interesting and well written book. Now I can say that I am able do make mead. The only thing I did not like is that sometimes the author's comments on ingredients or techniques seem to be solely based on his own experience, rather than a cientific evidence. Sometimes I felt I was reading a blog post! Overall I loved the book, it reached my expectations as a begginer."
5,Worth Every Penny.,"The yeast and honey tables in this book make it worth the price. It gives a good history and theory of mead, as well as a good few great recipes. Definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in making or drinking mead."
4,Good Book for Beginners,"The book covers a wide range of topics pertaining to mead making, starting from history, ingredients, best practices, trouble shooting, and tips. Recommended for beginners like me."
1,obviously not durable enough,"Never got a chance to use this bake & serve set. The first time I ordered it was received smashed into many pieces. The packaging was barely there for a glass product. Amazon was nice enough to send me another replacement immediately. Although the shipping packaging was better, part of it arrived broken again. If this product can't handle even being shipped, how long will it last in the kitchen? I have sinced asked for my money back. Too heavy to keep returning damaged goods to the post office."
2,Super Heavy,"Nice looking, but super heavy. Hard to get out of oven and over range microwave because of weight. Even the lids are heavy."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I ordered this on June 9th, and I still have not received the product. I have called 3 times. The first and second times I was told the item was shipped that day. Today, I was told it has not been shipped. The Customer Service staff is rude. They need to be trained. I will never order from them again and I would highly recommend anyone planning on doing so, find another vender."
4,good value for money,"i bought this to use until i find my good feeler gauge. in fact it's good enough for a primary gauge. that said i never need to measure gaps less than .001"" - and usually not less that .01"", so if you're making industrial tools or aerospace parts, take my recommendation with a grain."
4,OEM 25025,Not a bad set for the price.My feeler gauge set had seen it's day after 25 yrs. of use.I would buy this product again.
4,I like it,This has been my trusty feeler gauge and it goes where my tool kit goes. It has lasted me for a while. The printings are still there and might fade in a few years.I would have preferred if it was etched but you get what you pay for.
5,10 year old and loving it!!:),"Personally I love Peter Pan things and that ""I'll Try...""song made me cry when I saw it in the movie theater,And really all these songs are great...They make me feel like I never wanna grow up also...:)Those songs have that way that move you,Like make you sad....And man...I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!:)PETER PAN ALL THE WAY!Wahooo!:)"
5,When The Holy Spirit Is Ready To Move On You In The Things Contained In This Book...,"then you are ready to read this book. The Holy Spirit revealed to me via this book that the He must come out of you. This is the only way you will affect His Church, yourself, your environment, and the world. Otherwise, everything we do is dung! Meaning its dead and need to be thrown out. This book is invaluable to His Church because unless we are broken then the Church suffers from too little Christ and too much fallen souls. May the Holy Spirit prepare you for the contents of this book and may you follow it. Oh btw, you might want to purchase this book from [...] that way you KNOW you are getting the ""Christian Fellowship Publishers"" version instead of whatever is available (because the sellers think all the different publishers of this book have the same content)."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased this cassette recorder because I wanted a small one with a full size tape. When I listened to the first recording that I made of a meeting, there was a constant hum or noise during the playback that clearly came from the recording mechanism. The recording feature is of such poor quality that I am surprised that this product is still on the market.My advice to anyone considering this recorder is to look at another brand. I returned the one I bought for a refund because in my opinion, it was worthless."
4,Much Better Than The HP iPaq 2215,"I've had the hx2755 for about 3 months now its been great so far. I used to have the HP iPaq 2215, and the hx2755 is a big upgrade. The biometric fingerprint reader is a nice addition and the wraparound rubber grip is an added touch. I like the size of it and the VGA screen.There are some things I am troubled with, though. It has no Nevo! I loved Nevo on my 2215. HP should really have added that. Another thing, the unit turns on by itself. I tried a few things to help, they didn't help, but then I turned off the encryption, and now it stays off until needed.The HP iPAQ hx2755 is great for business oriented people or people needing a good, reliable PDA for notes and/or schedules."
1,"Amazon, you can do better.","Don't mix cd's in with a DVD. Bad form. you are usually better than that. This is written by his wife who orders under his name....easier, but it's starting to really irritate me."
3,I love norah jones but...,I got this dvd as a gift back in 2003 and watched it once. I tried to watch it again last night and remembered why I only watched it once. It's not that she sounds bad but the camera angles (on top of the music) wasn't where it could have been. It may have been better to not keep the camera on her so much... she seemed nervous. I appreciate the occasional audience clip but that wasn't there. The direction could have been much better.
4,Great Read Timely Delivery,This book was very helpful for my problems with two teen boys. It is never too late to turn around a bad behavior.
5,Miraculous!,"Here Callas achieved something that neither Sills nor Sutherland could do: She sang Lucia's madscene and Lady Macbeth's aria in ONE live recital to PERFECTION! The voice sounds GORGEOUS, it's at ease and brilliant. The colours, the miraculous acuti, the flawless trills, coloratura and runs... She is the QUEEN OF OPERA!"
3,Hollywood is illiterate or ( JK Rowling lets evil win),"Was this movie actually based on the book? I realize there are time restrictions for movies, but when I couldn't even explain what some of the scenes or plot was about to a casual fan friend of mine, that left me sad. How about at least giving us fans an ""under edited"" version for the DVD! Come on, the burrow never burned down and Dumbledore died, where's the funeral scene! These last two theatrical installments are miserable! I'm just completing collections at this point. I just hope they don't flub the final two movies. At this current rate of deviation, they might as well make Harry Potter a vampire in a homosexual love triangle in the deathly hallows movies! My advice would be to read the books for a plot, see the movies for mental imagery then, reread the book to figure out what you just saw. p.s.(the audio books are awesome!)"
4,Collecting Harry Potter Movies,We enjoy watching Harry Potter and have all the previous movies so added this one to the collection. Can't wait for the last ones to come out!
3,Could there be magic yet?,"I've seen every Harry Potter film so far released and have been underwhelmed by all of them. I've never really been interested by the somewhat flimsy plots nor engaged by the characters. There's something parochial about them, partly because so much of each movie is set in or around Hogwarts. In fairness, however, none of these limitations are likely to bother the target audience. Half Blood Prince is yet again set mostly in the school for the magically gifted but this time the story manages, to some extent, to surpass what has gone before. The plot is fuller than in the previous episodes, and the familiar characters are growing up, thus giving scope for them be fleshed out -- suddenly they're much more interesting to us older viewers. The acting has also improved over the years -- even Daniel Radcliffe has lost most of his woodenness. All in all this is the best of the Potter films so far, despite suffering from some of the failings of the others."
3,Amazon HD rental,"The movie was ok. I would say it's probably the worst of the first 6 slightly.I rented it via the Amazon internet rentals. Even though I got the ""HD"" selection for $3.99 it was not very high definition. I would have rented it locally if I had known how blocky some scenes would be, like the action-packed underwater part.The convenience of that was nice, but the price was steep as well. I would give the movie a 3 star but the Amazon rental a 2 star."
2,Lousy sound,"I'm not that big of Harry Potter fan and bought this Blu-ray for the kids. I'll leave a discussion of the plot to others. However, I will mention that the sound quality on the Blu-ray received was particularly poor, at least through the first 30 minutes or so. The TV volume had to be cranked up to almost full just to barely be able to hear any dialog. After a while, the movie volume improved and the TV volume could be lowered a bit. There were several dark scenes that were too dark, making the viewing quite difficult. For the most part, I don't see much point in buying the Blu-ray version of this movie, primarly due to the crummy sound reproduction and a dark video making Blu-ray moot. This version that came from Amazon was missing the digital copy of the movie, but Amazon has recognized the problem and will apparently be sending out a free copy of the widescreen DVD. Hopefully, the sound quality will be better on the DVD."
3,So so,"The movie was so so but jeez, its not that fun anymore. Watching the movie is like doing a chore. Only reason your watching it is hoping to see if they stick to the book.Who knows how they'll butcher the last entry of the book.I just wish they didnt make harry potter movies instead opted for tv shows. 7 season corresponding to 7 books. therefore everything is explained!!But whatever..."
1,WORST video quality ever,"I'll leave it to others to discuss the sorry translation from novel to film. My WARNING is about the horrendous quality of the video. I saw the original in a theater, and this Blu-ray version is a sad mess of a transfer. Dark (yes, I know the movie is ""dark""), soft, erratic quality. Most scenes dim and muddy with the rare, occasional cut to something bright and contrasty. I even attempted to adjust the viewing quality twice during playback and nothing made it better. This appears to be simply a bad job of mastering or duplication and this disc should be recalled without hesitation. I've haven't seen video quality this poor since the early days of VHS."
2,"I love the movie, but it was supposed to be new and it skipped","I was excited to get the Harry Potter movie at such a great price, and it was supposed to be new, and was packaged as such. The problem was that the dvd was defective, and skipped."
2,Lenticular case = an unweildy gimmick that costs more,"I bought this from Target (supposedly, it's a Target exclusive). Honestly, I just wanted the 2-disc set. I could care less about this holographic packaging. It's two heavy pieces of acrylic with a holographic sheet sandwiched in between. If you can even fit it into a DVD rack, you'll have to keep the outer plastic wrapper that holds this useless hard case packaging and the relevant DVD info (on a loose paper sheet) together. I actually feel a bit ashamed of owning this marketing travesty but it was my only option. If you have a choice, save some money and get the conventional 2-disc set."
5,Great movie!,Blu ray is a quality format for movies! I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters and had to watch it again as a review before I went and saw part 1 of deathly hallows!
3,ultimate edition,"I have always purchased all the ultimate editions. It was advertised as having the most deleted scenes added. But with every addition, it includes less. Which is very disappointing. But I keep buying because of the cards, the background footage that is included on the disks. Even though throughout the series they repeat some of the same footage. It's a good product if you want more detailed information. But I have a feeling they will be coming out with the ultimate ultimate edition that will include all they advertised with this series."
2,What a disappointment!,"The entire series of HP movies has been inconsistent at best. The first three were excellent in every way - from the scripting to the acting, special effects, character development, etc. No. 4 (Goblet of Fire) was okay - but gratituous and vivid violence - not a kid's movie. No. 5 redeemed itself somewhat, but felt sketchy and showed little or no character development. Alas - my high hopes for #6 were dashed. Very slow start left me waiting for something - ANYTHING to happen - very disjointed. As I continued watching, I saw a few small redeeming story lines emerge, but the character development was missing. Again, the script was disjointed - and the violence still more mature than a 10-year-old should see. All this movie did was to confirm two of my suspicions about two prominent characters. No - I won't be a spoiler and tell you what happens. We're lucky that the script revealed anything at all! Please, Harry - graduate from Hogwarts!"
3,What happened to the magical stuff?,"Is it just me or did anyone else miss the missing magic? No moving staircases, no talking portraits, no movement in the newspaper pictures! Those things really added to the magic of the stories. Sadly, changing directors with every movie has totally messed up all the stories since The Prisoner of Azkaban! I'm shocked that Ms. Rowling would let them trash the story lines so badly. Shame on you Ms. Rowling."
3,Kind of disappointed,I was looking forward to this latest in this series. Was disappointed in the ending of the movie. Hope they can bring it back into the story.
3,Choppy!,I thought that it was quite choppy for most of the movie until the end. I was confused by alot of it. It didn't dwell very much on the important things like the Weasley housing burning down or Dumbledorfs death. There was too much jumping from one scene to the next. Once you get past that you get to some of the plot of the movie. I wish it were like the rest. I will buy the movie of course and the ending was sad but I had more questions than I recieved answers with this one.
2,"Don't be suprised, if you've seen the other movies.","At this point everyone who has read the books and watched the movies should know what to expect. Added lovey scenes, and deleted important seens. So buy this movie for the visuals and the acting. Don't buy this if you're expecting to see the book take place on your TV.p.s.What's with the diner scene?"
3,Sorry i didn't have a blu-ray,"I bought it I got it but unfortunately had ordered the wrong one, not realizing it until I had open the plastic wrap...Amazon was very good about helping replace the movie...thank you."
5,What can you say bad about Harry Potter?,All the Potter DVDs are excellent so there's nothing bad I can say about this DVD. They're all good. Great series.
3,Biggest disappoinment...,"Of the MANY MANY important things left out of this movie, the thing I found myself missing the most was the scene where Dumbledore tells the Durley's off finally. We Harry lovers have been waiting through 5 other books and films for that moment, and it was a scene I most looked forward to seeing in the movie.. only to see it replaced with some hideously lame scene about Harry flirting with a girl in a diner. REALLY??????? Guh. I felt robbed by this movie for many reasons, but that was the biggest crime of all.I'm very worried how underwhelming the next two films will be :("
2,harry potter and the half blood prince,"I have all of the Harry Potter movies, and I thought the last one was the darkest, I was wrong. This movie was boring and didnt hold my families attention at all. I was really dissapointed."
3,Harry is Back !!!!,"Harry Potter and the half blood prince exceeds expectations. Comming off of the 5th Harry Potter film I was not sure how much life was in the Harry Potter Franchise,however, Harry Potter and the half blood prince definitly brings some more life and inticipation for the big two part ending!!Any Harry Potter fan or fantasy film fan will enjoy this movie."
2,What Happened to the ending,"One of the things that annoys me most about the movie versions of the Harry Potter series are the things they leave out or water down. The book in this case is EXCELLENT, however the big reveal at the end and the battle scenes in the move was a COMPLETE and TOTAL let down. I can't believe that they decided to dummy down the ending. Where there was a explosive battle scene just after the Snape completed his agreement with Dumbledore the remaining scenes with Fenrir Greyback and the confrontation of Snape and Harry was very disappointing."
2,Not bad.,"This was by no means my favorite Potter movie. But to complete the collection, you obviously have to have it."
4,Steven Of Jonesboro Movie Review,"Well this last show wasnt what i expected, not as good as the other shows of the series,but its all adding up to the conclusion. Would recommend it if you are a follower of the sequent. Go Harry"
1,NO DIGITAL COPY,"Bought this movie for the DVD/BR/Digital Copy . . .1) When you insert the disc, no iTunes support2) It tells you to go to [...]3) Welcome to Warner Bros. Digital Copy Redemption: The Digital Copy offer for this title has expiredWarner Brothers . . . thanks for nothing; I'd understand if they didn't sell this ISBN/UPC, but it says ""Expired May 7"" inside."
5,Arrived fast,"I had a quick delivery with this order and got the package a day before expecting it. I purchased this as a gift and have not taken it out of its wrapper, so when/if I hear back from the recipient about the quality of the dvd, then I will add to my review."
4,More Please!,"Harry Potter has always been a favorite of mine. I grew up with the HP books and the movies throughout the years. This movie was great but is not the extended edition, if that is what you are looking for. I like the cover art and the darker side of the movie series highlighted in the cover.The cinematic atmosphere through the movie is dark and erie, like you would imagine in the book. This movie is not a direct copy of the book (which movie actually does that?!?) and has its own spin on things. This movies has a large amount of adventure and action, but also has a flare of drama."
4,Recommend,I would recommend this to girls and boys and adults as well. The show was great even though it really veered from the book.
3,somewhat dissappointing ending,I found the first 2/3 of the movie very entertaining with interestingdialogue and action . The end seemed rather contrived and not fluid .Throughout the series Snape has gone from bad guy to good guy to bad guy again andsomehow it didn't seem plausible anymore to me that he should be the bad guy .Just doesn't feel right . Maybe it would have been OK if it was presentedbetter but seemed all artificially pasted together .Was also seeing toomany parallels to Star Wars - Obi Wan - Darth Vader .I haven't read the books so I can't compare .
4,Decent,"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was good, as it (most of the time) stayed true to the novels, with some little sit-com like additions (which I personally am not so fond of). A word of warning: If you have very small children (5,6) they may be frightened by some of the more intense scenes. This IS the darkest Harry Potter movie yet, and you have to keep in mind that the movies get progressively darker, so the next two (as the seventh book is being split into to different releases) will only be darker.A note on the soundtrack: I found myself turning it the volume up and down at different points in the movie, as win they whisper it trails off into nothi.... and when the yell it GETS REALLY LOUD!!!! It's inevitable that this happens, I've spoken with others who complain of the same problem.Personally this is the only format I would by movies on, as the visuals are just so wonderfully stunning."
1,No English subtitles. Said it did on the Amazon description.,"The Amazon free shipping delivery time was very good and the product arrived in good condition. But, I was disappointed to find that this dvd of Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince did not have English subtitles. My wife and I are elderly and have trouble understanding (we hear just fine) the modern movie recording techniques. It would have been a good bargain but, as it is, I have had to return the dvd and look for a proper dvd to add to our Harry Potter collection."
4,White Boy Rap,"This is this best white boy hip-hop/rap I've ever heard. I'm surprised I actually like this album because I'm not at all a fan of rap. This rap is different than most, its humorous, has its own pace, and is just plain cool. Out of all the Beastie Boys' albums this is there first and best I've ever heard. If you've heard and like the Beasties buy this one."
5,Gotta love it!,"Anyone who likes the Beastie Boys should definitely purchase this album, even if you've heard it all already. If you haven't, strap in and prepare for great rhymes, clean beats and some thick bass. I strongly caution anyone who leans toward cheaper headphones as the basslines in some of these songs will wreak havoc on lower quality drivers.Complete Track Listing:1. Rhymin' and Stealin'2. The New Style3. She's Crafty4. Posse in Effect5. Slow Ride6. Girls7. Fight For Your Right (to Party)8. No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn9. Paul Revere10. Hold it Now, Hit It11. Brass Monkey12. Time to Get iLLMost of these tracks have pretty good bass, so I'd say make sure you have something that thumps pretty well. Enjoy."
3,A hint at the potential of the group,"I think that the Beastie Boys are great because they bring such a broad stylistic scope into rap. Rap with the Boys becomes rock, but that isn't so evident on this CD. I believe that the real place to begin is with Paul's Boutique, where the Dust Brothers could properly render their vision. Here all we have a bunch of wimpy drum machines and a couple a samples, including the unforgettable Led Zeppelin base to ""Rhymin and Stealin"". The other high point, I believe, is the anthem ""Fight For Your Right"", complete with a Fender guitar solo."
2,For the hard-core fans,"Not one of their best albums, for completists. I would stick to the many other better releases coming up later."
3,Surrealism in prose,"Long, massive, exhaustive narrative of the life of Oscar Matzerath, an eccentric boy who at the age of 3 decides he will no longer grow and ""drums"" his feelings and passions by means of a drum. He is not a normal character, but rather a means through with G.Grass, using extensive obscure symbolism, repulsive fantasies, surrealism and metaphors, expresses the horrors of German/Polish society during the reign of nasism. O.Matzerath in fact is bizare, absurd, grotesque, and disturbing. G.Grass is a master of skilful prose revealing the poet writer as well, in a baroque/rococo style which intoxicates the reader. The book is not pleasant reading, with schoking passages. Deceptive in terms of expectations for a Nobel Prize winner. If you are willing to endure the challenge of reading ""The Tin Drum,"" take your chance!"
2,Keep off the Grass.,"Overall, The Tin Drum seemed to be a drawn-out laborious journey for me. I've always heard so much about the merits of The Drum, perhaps I was expecting too much from it? The first three or four chapters had me thoroughly absorbed in Oskar's ancestry, and for the rest of the book I kept waiting for someone as interesting and human as his grandmother Anna to show up, but I was to be disappointed. Granted, Oskar's mother Agnes is another consistent and great character, but besides these two... oyvay! Oskar was such an unreal personage that I found him impossible to trust as a narrator... with every beat of his drum he startled the already frightened theme of this book into a corner. I never found that corner. If you enjoy authors who tend to dive in and out of the ""fantastic"" and the ""real"" I would recommend you go to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Hermann Hesse, or Charles Williams, but for goodness sakes... ""keep off the Grass."""
3,Mein Revu of ze buk,Ziz iz no Buddenbrooks!!!! Ze Thomas Mann iz ze better writer!!! Hmphhh!!!Mein reading of ze buk iz zat its no zo good az Buddenbrooks!!!! Hmphhh!!!
4,Great Movie,"This was a great movie all the way thru. It was a little long but worth watching. I loved the cast, many of the great actors are in this movie. Even though this film was not based on any one persons life, you will find a bit of history and a bit of a reminder of how close our black families can be."
1,Jason Vorhee's,This movie was not that great considering that it is not Jason it is Mrs.Vorhee's.If I were you I would save my money on John Crpenter's Ghost's of Mars.
3,Not what I expected,"Like I said, It wasn't what I expected but this certainly built suspense in the veiweres brain, good blood and a perfect ending where the killer is reaveald gives this one 3 stars!"
3,A one of a kind camp slasher flick. Influential,"When I first saw this film I fell in love with it and started renting all of the sequels. Lots of films try to imitate it but they're nowhere near as well done as this one. Cast features Kevin Bacon and stage and screen actress Betsy Palmer. A great look at the great outdoors before all the slashings and gore begins. A total masterpiece! Followed by eight sequels which are nowhere as well done as this one, but still enjoyable. Check them out, cause this is the one that started the whole cult series. A definite cult classic!"
5,I am sick of people putting this down,If somebody makes a movie and it is still rented and bought pretty reguarly then they should at least consider it a decent movie. There is no way that a true horror fan can't like this. If you are a true fan and don't like it your a liar.
3,weirdness on the extras? anyone else have this problem?,"on my blu-ray, the ""fresh cuts"" and ""secrets behind the gore"" extras are not full screen. they are actually 1/4 screen. the upper left hand corner to be exact. am i an imbecile or is this a problem on the disc? help!"
4,I got bored,Well let me start off with saying most of these were excaltly the same. This one was really Mrs. Voorhees and Jason wasn't really even in it. I wished she was in the next few to help Jason out. The whole story about Jason is that one day he went swimming but since the counselers were making out and he couldn't swim he drowned and Mrs. Voorhees really never got over that. She took it out by killing future counselors at Camp Crystal Lake. What I didn't like about this one was you didn't really see her until the end. People obvisously got bored of this and decided to give Jason his hockey mask. There's a lot more nudity in these movies than in any other horror movie i've seen. This movie was ok and that's why I gave it four stars instead of two.
4,Rent it before you buy,"The only reason I would think that someone would look at the reviews for a Friday the 13th movie is that they haven't seen it. If you are one of those individuals that haven't viewed this movie, then please go to blockbuster, hollywood video, videotime, or what ever other video rental store you go to and rent this movie and the rest of the series. Why? Because the Friday the 13th series is not for everyone. The DVD doesn't have many extras, mostly just trailers and commentary, so if you buy DVDs for the extras, and not the exellecent audio and picture, buy the VHS version."
3,The worst!,"I'm not sure to give it 2 or 3 stars, but decieded to go with 3. It's actually rather boring. A few kids go to Crystal Lake Camp for the summer, and there they get killed one by one. I'm sure you all know who the killer is, but I will keep the secret for you who has not seen the movie. (It's NOT f**kin' Jason) The movie is really low-budget, and the colors are really dark, but the gore is good (Tom Savini) so...an extra star for that. Nice too have seen it though"
2,"this movie was ""okay""","this movie was boring throughout the first hour.but then it got scary when jason's mama comes in which was about 15 minutes to the end.i dont really reccomend this movie,though"
2,An obvious slasher film with serious ambitions,"A couple of idiotic hornballs become fillet at a summer camp. Unappealing characters, lack of plot(only a little bit), gratuitous gore, and utter predictability sink this one. It's only it's influence and Manfredini's notorious score that make it worth a peek. Followed by way too many sequels."
2,Ghost train of a movie,"Fair enough this movie is now 26 years old, but I have no idea how it could of spawned so many sequels to be perfectly honest. I watched this for the very first time last week and I was painfully disapointed because I love a good old horror flick. You dont really get to see alot of gore in this movie, everyone just mysteriously vanishes and then turns up dead in a ""ghost train"" type manner, the type of ghost train that's in the lamest amusement park one could imagine. By ghost train I mean, dead bodies just pop out from nowhere in the most random of fashions. *Spoiler to follow* One problem I had is that the Mother was incapable of taking down a small fumbling blonde girl towards the end but had no problem killing the larger males of the group. The arrow thru the eye was a cool touch, but it would of been good to actually see it!To help pave the way for future horror flicks this is a decent start, but the storyline is really bad lol"
4,"One of the first ""holiday"" horror movies, and still the best","What scared me the most about this movie was the stalking music. You remember sh,sh,sh,...ha,ha,ha. The film may be low-budget but it definately delivers it share of screams, gore, and horror. If you're in a video store one Saturday night and can't find anything...take home Friday the 13th Pt.1-2, Everyone needs a little JASON in their lives"
4,A good slasher classic,"- The first movie in a serie is always the best. F13 part 1 is a awesome slasher classic, alltough not my personal favourite in the serie. A good buy if you enjoy horror/slashers."
4,A great COPYCAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"great movie and would have 5 stars if it wasn't an obvious Halloween wanna-be!Its great and is the best of the series but we all know that it wouldn't exist if John Carpenter's classic Halloween didn't exist.But this is the best of all 10 of them.2 is also pretty good but you wanna turn it off when the main character dies within the fist 10 minutes.I love the main character Alice,and how well Adrianne King plays her.buy this movie along with Halloween,and A Nightmare On Elm Street!!!!"
5,True Horror,"This isn't the one that started the slasher formula, the ones that ripped it off did. The first one was original, but then was turned into a joke by the mindless sequels. The only GOOD ones in the series are parts 1,2,and3. Skip the rest. I really enjoyed this film, but in order to get scared in it, you do have to take it seriously. Watch this one alone in the dark for the best atmosphere. Horror classic! NOT A HALLOWEEN RIP-OFF!!!"
5,Friday the 13th is the greatest Horrer Movie Series!,"I love this movie, The one that started the Friday the 13 franchise! All Horror Movie fans should have this in their collection!"
4,"Still a classic, but couldn't tell what was ""uncut""","Being a classic slasher genre fan, I expected a bit more here for an ""uncut"" version. The movie as always is a cult classic must-see, but if you're expecting lots of unseen gory footage, you'll be disappointed."
1,A ok movie but really not that good,I saw it and I thought it was just ok. I had never sene it before so I honestly dint know what to think. But I dont think it was as good as it could of been.
4,Great Movie,"The Original and Best of the Jason Series. It doesn't get any better than this. With the execption of the 2nd movie, this is the best one to get. If you get any Jason movies, get this one and Part 2."
3,the best of the series...,"""Friday the 13th"". This is ""the original slasher flick"". It all starts off in the late '50's where two teen ""make love"" and are brutally murdered. It then picks up in the early eighties where teen consuelors are murdered one by one by a revenge driven women (the mother of the boy who drowned there in the late 50's Jason of course). MPAA Rating: R for strong violence and gore, sex, brief nudity, and some profanity."
4,Good Cd,"I bought this for my husband, who remembers listening to this when he was a teenager. We tried to find it at our local music store at the mall but they couldn't even order it. Amazon truly has everything from A to Z."
2,The pursuit of my deepest desires is not obedience,"The pursuit of my deepest desires is not obedience. I agreed with a lot of what Dr Crab has to say, but point 2 of chapter 7 I cannot agree with. Jesus obeyed the Father and it was definitely not His greatest desire. He would have been happy to skip the cross if it could have been God's will. I believe that in some cases divorce is God's will."
4,I was thrilled to Test Drive Lady Speed ...,"I was thrilled to Test Drive Lady Speed Stick Invisible Dry Antiperspirant & Deodorant, and it was a great product. Like its name, it actually was invisible AND dry. There was no residue left behind and the deodorant didn't spoil my clothes like gel deodorants do. The smell was great too....it smelled EXACTLY like baby powder and I felt really fresh. The only drawback was the smell didn't last long. Overall, it was a great product!"
2,"Thermoskin Arthritic Gloves, Black, Sold by the Pair - Medium",Doesn't seem to work as advertised. I have arthritis on two fingers and wearing this thermoskin overnight doesn't help to relieve the pain. Return it to the merchant.
1,"Thermoskin material wonderful, gloves are so-so!","The thermoskin material is wonderful for compression needed, but the gloves do not fit across the hand very well to give compression all over, were it's needed. I cut all the fingers off, and use them that way. The fingers also work on the toes. I would not buy them again, due to the fact they are to expensive!!! Customer service is horrible! I would NOT recommend buying these"
3,Watch the Size You Order,"Be very careful with the size you order. Using the size chart, I measured my hand and the chart put me at the high end of the Small size. I have never worn anything small in my life. The instructions suggest ordering the next larger size in this situation. I ordered the Medium.When the product arrived they were too tight to wear so I ordered the Large size. I should have just ordered the Large size in the first place since that is what I normally wear."
3,it works sorta,I ordered small then found the size chart differs from most size chrats and should have gotten an extra small but they are okay snugwize.They seem to work.I wear them over night. My con is I don't like the material. It's scratchy rather than smooth. Also I did not recieve any reciept or return info with the package.
5,"This CD is kickin down in Houston ""Wanna Be A Baller"" is it","I think that this cd is kickin. I hear that ""Wanna Be A Baller"" song coming out everybody's ride. The rest of the cd is good to."
4,Not bad at all. Great EXTENDED reading.,"I didn't get into Fly Girl that much. I did pick up on Omar Tyree's writing style. He is a bit wordy and very discriptive. Sometimes it seems like a waste of paper...but this novel was pretty good. It was a thick and wordy book, but once you get to the end, you will appreciate it. Omar is very descriptive when it come to sights, sounds, and feelings, and it is very easy to get into the book and put yourself right in scenario. Booby Dallas is a funny man who does make the wrong choices even though they point him to the right choices. A very good book, but if I were Omar's editor, there were a couple chapter that weren't necessary and would've made the book a pleasent, intermediate reading book. How long did it take me to read? 4 weeks. Way to long...but the ending kind of made up for that. OMAR, YOU SHOULD REALLY WRITE A FOLLOW UP OR SOMETHING TO THIS BOOK. BOBBY DALLAS' LIFE IS ONLY BEGINNING."
3,Well!!,"This was my first time reading Omar Tyree's work. Although I feel Bobby's character was well developed. I did tire of his whiny attitude. It got somewhat boring!!! It's like this, Bobby, did not miss his water until the well ran dry. In other words, he realized after turning away from Faye for Pearl that he had made the wrong choice. Hey, we all do sometime. However, I am happy he realized who his soul mate was and got it together!! O.K.!!"
4,Good look at a male perspective,"'Do Right Man', Bobby D was typical, a little naive and confused. I never really got the feeling that HE knew what he wanted in a relationship. I didn't think he a was wimp, his character displayed a warm and sensitive man, just unsure about the best direction for his personal life. Some people take longer to mature than others, it was as if he was waiting for something to happen. The story was a little slow in spots, I was surprised since he determined that Faye was his 'soulmate', that he never even tried to locate her. Don't know if I like Faye's getting pregnant but, realisticly things do happen. The book showed a lot of strong Black men, that was a plus. I really did enjoy reading this book."
2,what the ....!?,I am usually a fast reader (a book a day)when not working. But this book took me forever to get through. The main character was just too tempermental and just didn't appeal to me at all. I thought it would NEVER end. Not a good effort at all.
1,Disappointment,"I thought the author wasted his readers time w/a character like Bobby Dallas. If the author thought Bobby was a 'Do Right Man' he needs to go back and talk to some 'real men'. I felt his character was a chump and didn't deserve Faye. When she turned from a smart, intelligent woman to an idiot by getting pregnant, he compromised her character. Since his main character was such a dismal failure the two of them deserved each other. Next time I'll wait on the paperback if or when it gets to the library."
2,Slow...Typical....Predictable,"This is my 2nd book by Omar and I was not impressed at all. I read ""Leslie"" sometime last year and didn't like it but I thought that I would try another one of his book. This story was very slow moving, to many details regarding ""Radio"". Did not like."
4,Overall Good Book,"I got this book on audio and i must say it was a great listen. I didn't feel like having to read through the whole thing i figure that would take about a week, but i finished the audio tapes in 1 day. It was like you could see everything that was happening unfold right in front of your eyes by listening to it. THis is a great portrayal of the dating scene at times i found some of the situations he went through were some of the same as the ones i went through."
1,Didnt even finish!! IT DRAGGED ON TOOO MUCH!!!,"I read Fly Girl and Single Mom, but A Do Right Man seemed to drag on too much. I didnt even get to finish and I got bored after a while, Omar could have done better to try and catch even a teenagers attention. Maybe the next one will be a little bit better, I HOPE!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The best and realistic Desert Storm game EVER!,This game takes you into bagdad to find Hussien and complety destroy his army...the controls at first are kinda wierd but you get use to them really fast..
5,A mount for my Garmin Edge 500,I can mount the Edge 500 on my wrist while cycling and twist my arm to avoid reflections from the sun. I wish I could mount it so that the unit goes across my wrist.
4,A Flawed Gem,"This version of Watcher of the Skies and Firth of Fifth are worth the price of this CD alone. The few new tracks are also great. However, I know what I like and Your own special way are classic examples of why as brilliant as Steve Hackett is, he really needs a heavy-handed producer to pull him away from directions like these. The ending to Watcher of the Skies still brings chills up my spine - UNREAL. Buy it."
5,late july organic classic rich crackers,"Excellent crackers! Would highly recommend to anyone who buys the ""Ritz"" cracker.Enjoy!"
3,Luftwaffe,"With so much info on the luftwaffe this one could have been better. earlier versions of the Me110 could have been covered more instead of so many of the ""C"" version..."
2,Sad commentary,I found it sad and cruel that this woman could not appreciate the horror her family lived through. It was very self serving of her to use their experience in such a way as to satisfy her own identity search/emotional work and publish during their lifetimes.
3,rational over emotional,it takes the author a long time to allow herself to write freely about her subject. it seems to me that she is largely the victim of her own need to control her narrative. this takes away from the impact of her story and often turns her report into a lukewarm listing of events. only when she describes her mother's narrative and steps aside to let her mother speak and when she gains a deeper understanding of her own identity does this narrative take wing and become lyrical at times and moving most of the time. the book will appeal to students of the Shoah (Holocaust) and those interested in Jewish identity.

2,"the foxfire book,",Was not what I expected. The information was hard to read because it was kept in the wording of the people interviewed.
4,Great game,"Chinese Checkers is a classic and in my opinion, this gameset is a really good buy for the price. The wooden board is very sturdy (and heavy I might add) and I love the actual indentations for the marble pieces. My set did come with a bag for the marbles (some reviewers had said they were missing theirs).My only gripe was that the marbles seem to be coated with cheap paint - and some of them are flaking off a little bit. I wish the set had come with clear glass marble pieces. Overall - fun game and this is a good set to get!"
3,durable classic version of the game,was pleased to find a durable version of this classic. Only wish it were a little larger for small fingers to move about. My 4 year old grandson was enthusiastic! A few spare marbles would be a good idea. I have many more grandkids.
1,Worst One Yet,"I have bought Print Shop in the past and they were great, but this one is horrible! There are so many glitches in the program. I would definatly NOT recommend this to others."
2,Illegal?,Bought for my class to watch after we finished the book. Good movie but every 30 minutes a line of text about copyright infringement pops up... kind of annoying/distracting and also makes me think the tape might have been illegally made?
2,Far better....,"...in my memory than in actuality. Honestly, for some reason, I think the title track absolutely rocks -- in that crotch-grabbing way in which most good ""sleaze/glam rock"" always tends to. Otherwise, this collection of tunes blows overall (yeah, Toast of the Town is cool, but I still prefer Motley's version over the one found here), and I quickly re-discovered why PBF never elevated to the heights of success reached by similar lipstick and hairspray bands: because the songwriting was fairly weak, and simply sucked balls in comparison. PBF does look the part; so put on your leather pants, tease your hair to the sky, and do yourself (and everybody else) a favor and go slap on Vain's 'No Respect' instead..."
2,"Sounds OK, but 4 major issues. PLEASE READ.","1) Will not see all songs on a CD. I have a country music MP3 CD of 180 songs, and it will only be able to access 167 of them. It won't see the last 13. I also have a bluegrass music CD of 200 songs, and it only reads the first 179 of them. All files on both CD's are in the root directory.2) Reads ID3 tags (somewhat), but the embedded software crashes if you try to scroll through the tracks to find the song you want -- you need to turn the radio off and back on again. Overall, VERY POOR embedded software design!3) Audio skips occasionally when reading an MP3.4) Radio tuner will not receive all the stations that my other boombox does.The only good thing I can say about it is that has a good, loud, clear sound unlike many other boomboxes."
4,Very good,"This is a really good atlas for a person who see cells at work.I like it, is small, easy to use and the pictures are very good."
4,from the back of the book...,"from the back cover...""During the past quarter of a century, the study of patronage-theatre relations in early modern England has developed considerably. This however, is the first extensive, wide-ranging, and representative study of patronage as it relates to Shakespeare and the theatrical culture of his time. Twelve distinguished theatre historians address such questions as: What important functions did patronage have for the theatre during this period? How, in turn, did the theatre impact upon and represent patronage? Where do paying spectators and purchasers of printed drama fit into the discussion of patronage? The authors also show how patronage practices changed and developed from the early Tudor period to the years in which Shakespeare was the English theatre's leading artist. This important book will appeal to scholars of Renaissance social history a s well as those who focus on Shakespeare and his playwriting contemporaries."""
5,Better than Lady Speed Stick,"I recently visited the tropics and my Lady Speed Stick did not hold up. I tried my husband's Speed Stick. It is completely scent free and it worked wonders. I never feared the sweaty armpits with this antiperspirant. If I weren't such a sucker for marketing (I like the womanly scents and pretty packaging), I'd buy men's Speed Stick. It's definitely a winner."
3,Michelle Williams doll is *ok*,"Destiny's Child is really a great group. I expected the dolls to be better, i didn't like them at first, but i think they're *ok* now. Michelle's doll is definetly the pretiest. I love the dress, the doll's red/brown hair is nice, too! Overall an okay doll. NOT what i expected."
3,A little rough,"The product is okay -- quite painful at first, with minor irritation, but not bad compared with other methods e.g. shaving, nairing, etc.Recommended usage could have been better articulated -- ensure your hair is as short as possible prior to using the product in order to mitigate discomfort."
4,great product,"I used it for underarms, and it was totally bearable when I was epilating, but I felt burns in my underarms after several hours. The second morning, I found redness and small scar-looking spots there but all the pains were gone. I'll continue trying it and I hope I'll get used to it after the second time."
5,Fascinating history of a great mountain,"Karen Lorentz has written a wild history of a wild mountain from its beginnings to the end of an era (pre-American Skiing Company). If you've ever skied Killington, or want to ski it--you'll love the ""virtual"" experience. The historic pictures tell as much of the story as the tale of the mountain, and the men and women who created it. This is the story of a mountain, when it was a great mountain of characters, and character."
5,~EXQUISITE~,"Richard Robbins provides one of the most important ingredients to any Merchant/Ivory production: luscious, haunting, melancholy music. Robbins' extraordinary ability to compose music which so compliments the drama is a rare gift. I was thrilled when I came across this CD set while browsing and it does not disappoint. Whether you are a fan of the novels of EM Forster or the film adaptations by Merchant/Ivory - or just someone who loves beautiful music - this is a wonderful gift for yourself."
5,Good Stuff,"Leaves my hair silky and I can blow dry it straight without much effort. Doesn't have too much more than a slight pleasant smell (I hate it when hair products smell strongly) and I think my hair looks a lot healthier since I've been using it. My hairdresser even noticed. I use in conjunction with either the matching shampoo or the ""clear"" shampoo in this same line."
1,I think they put a cheapo conditioner in the jar and sent it.,"The prduct inside the conditioner is not real. It is so thin, less conditioing than a $6 pantene conditioner. I believe the seller ""haircare24inc"" has packaged a cheaper product in the loreal jar and sent it. It is heavy so not worthwhile to send it back and pay all the postage ( about $15 both ways ) so I just kept it but would hate for anyone else to be duped."
2,Fondue gone Wrong,I was looking for good classical fondue receipes but found this book full of off the wall asian receipies and other things one wouldn't normally associate with fondue. I'm sure they are all very nice but for a basic fondue book it would not be my choice and it is expensive for what it is.
2,Surprisingly Dull Playing from a Top Orchestra,"There is little to no life in this version of ""Fancy Free,"" in spite of the fact that it starts off with an interesting ""juke box"" version of one of the songs. The jazzy, hyperactive parts of the ballet are plodding and too carefully measured. The whole performance comes off more like a stately march rather than the exhuberant bravado that Bernstein wrote.I wasn't satisfied with the Overture to ""Candide"" or the Three Dance Episodes from ""On the Town,"" either. Where is the puffed-out chest? Where is the bright humor? Where is the $#*%@! JAZZ, for Pete's sake?! Bernstein was a showman, and Slatkin is normally up to the task. Somehow, he misses the mark here."
3,slow start,"a bit of a slow start, but then it warmed up and moved pretty well. all in all I'd say it was not bad, but not great. it was mostly interesting to see what the winnie the pooh author would write that isn't for kids."
4,Entertaining mystery,"In the vein of Sherlock Holmes, I enjoyed this book. It was a treat to find that AA Milne wrote for adults. Not modern action with electronics, the book is well written and makes the reader think. I recommend it. It was also my first book on my new Kindle Fire. What a fun way to read!"
3,Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised to see that A. A. Milne had written books for grown-ups. This was a well written, nicely paced mystery."
3,If you want more of the old style Dj Shadow look for Fat Jon,"But if you're interested in continuing the themes established on Endtroducing, you're in the right place...My nephews had been very critical of the ""You can't go home again"" preview release. One of them said ""I thought it was a joke...Shadow pulling our chain before he dropped the bomb with the new album..."" so I had low expectations and wasn't sure how it would sound. Frankly, I like the album quite a bit and think that many of the tunes sound like they were developed right around the same time as Endtroducing.But if you're looking for some kind of funky, downtempo, jazz and funk sample-based hip-hop/trip hop, pick up some Fat Jon the Ample Soul Provider. He's excellent and back in that vein. Shadow, however, has continued to move on from the flavor of ""What does your soul look like"". My prediction is that this will be another hugely influential album and inspire a new level of creativity (both good and bad) among the dj community."
5,Incredible,"DJ Shadow dominates once again. Back from Entroducing, he pounds hard techno beats into your head and makes you go back for more. He has the most influential music out of any hip hop DJ known to man. Un Autre Introduction is one of the most insane tracks i have ever heard. You wonder how could anyone with a sane mind pull this off. DJ Shadow deserves massive credit for his music. He is highly underrated. Believe me when i say this, go out and buy this cd. There is no way you could ever be disappointed by this music."
4,Knocking on the door of greatness ... but not quite there,"Ah yes the Private Press. Has it already been 6 years? Well it has and the album continues to impress. I honestly believe the album is appreciated more today than it was upon its' release back in 2002. DJ Shadow quality music with a bit more flair. This album could've been a masterpiece had it not been for some tracks. Ahem ...Monosylabik and Right Thing / GDMFSOB. To this day I have no idea why he did not include the other version of GDMFSOB with Roots Manuva (see the Private Repress). I simply couldn't give this album 5 star because of the above mentioned tracks.However, the remaining tracks are excellent. The Motorway songs are great with their continuity and soul. Giving up the Ghost shows off Shadows beat skills and Six Days has to be heard to be believed.If I could, I would give The Private Press 4 and a half stars."
2,Weakest of the Group.,"Now, I'm not a hardcore DJ Shadow fan but I know what I like and I like DJ Shadow. However when comparing Private Press to his other Cd's (Endtroducing, Preemptive Strike) it's the weakest. There were very few songs on this disk that I actually wanted to listen to all the way threw. I'm a big fan of his songs ""What does your soul look like"" (Mainly part 1) ""Highnoon"" and ""Stem/Long Stem"" just to name a few. IMO he tries really hard to be creative but these songs at times appear to come off sloppy and incoherant. Now to be fair there are some spots that sport very vibrant and dark beats that have to be heard. Unfortuatly you would be better off listening to the preview samples that online stores supply rather that actually buying the CD. This is just my opinion I could be way wrong!!!"
5,I love it!,"I purchased this from a local retailer not long ago and it is the best strapless bra I have ever had! One reviewer mentioned it rolling down- I am a very full C cup and have not had that problem at all. Another reviewer mentioned the inserts coming out when you wash it- well, you're supposed to take them out anyways to wash, so that's really not a fair comment to make.It is comfortable, supports well, and in my 31 years, is the only strapless bra I have found that I actually don't mind wearing!It's great!"
2,Not a good knife for hard use,I owned 2 of these knives and both broke at the tip and developed damage to the edge. Knives are not pry bars but they should not break when trying to dig a object out of wood or building materials. I have also ran across a lot of Benchmade's knives in the trash all with broken tips from normal military use. If you want a knife that is for everyday carry as a civilian it is fine but if you are law enforcement or military and you may have to depend on it look at something else.
5,An O.G like me,"I truley enjoyed the poetry this author had to offer. The author was able to let the readers re-live his experiences of a black male from his childhood to manhood. More poetry like this should be available for our young society to validate some of their emotions and to educate others on a culture different from their own. For example the poem ""Where I began where I am"", and ""My pop"" was insighful and inspiring. And of course my favorite ""BEAUTIFUL""! This poem will make any woman, of any color, of any size, feel desirable."
1,No illustrations !!!!!!!!!,"I stumbled across this old book online, and it looked interesting. I did not want to read it online, or print out the many pages in the book.I bought this copy from amazon.....and I was terribly disappointed when I received it because there are no illustrations in the book!! The book is worthless without the illustrations that go with it.Do not buy this book!"
2,Not a hit,"My 2.5 yr old will watch just about anything, but this just has never grabbed her attention. I don't know if it's an Ernie issue and just not enough other characters or what, but she's just not having it. She usually loves Seasame Street stuff, but this is a big miss with her. I'm glad I bought used."
4,Sesame Street Does It Again,"You have to love Sesame Street-they consistently produce material that is child-friendly and educational. The songs are catchy and it is a great tool for teaching numbers. I did not give the video five stars because I think Benny is annoying, but that is just my opinion."
2,does not model polite behavior,"I loved Sesame street growing up, but Sesame street as a whole seems to be going downhill to me. This video, while it does have a couple of great vintage clips, models HORRIBLY rude and disobedient behavior. The bunny is extremly rude to Ernie and the Honker, and Ernie and the Honker repeatedly bother and annoy Benny, even after Benny asks them to stop (and of course, asks in a rude way). The educational value is minimal. I really don't think this helped my child to count to 15 or to recognize his numbers. If you want some good vintage Sesame STreet clips, check out the 25th anniversary. Good clips, educational value is about the same, but no rude behavior, and no disobedient behavior."
3,Ugh,"Really Sesame Street? Worst Sesame street DVD we've ever watched. Bummed that I bought this. ""Count on Sports"" is a much better counting DVD. Basically, every other SS DVD we own is beyond WAY better than this one."
1,Bad Influence,"There is so much to love about the SS approach to teaching children, but this video is a grave disappointment. Throughout the video this bunny with a rotten attitude screams at everyone for little to no reason. With small children imitating everything they see, this is harmful exposure for behaviour development.I also agree with the review about Elmo. I have a growing annoyance with listening to Elmo speak in the third person. Come on! Are you educational or not?"
1,Don't like it,"I like Sesame Street in general and my daughter loves Elmo. But this video has a very annoying character, the gruff sounding bunny. I think the bunny ruins it, he's not cute and he's just an annoying little character. Also, there is more talking in this video than the other ones we own. I like the ones with more singing. Our favorites of Sesame Street so far are Kids Favorite Songs and Elmo's Guessing Game."
5,warning: addictive! (mostly for the baby),"My 15-mo.-old daughter *loves* this video. It's actually a little scary how asking her if she wants to watch Ernie makes her face light up! She is starting to know her numbers, definitely from this video -- in fact I just ordered the ABC one so she is not *only* learning her numbers. It's a great video with nice bits and great songs. Three thumbs up (kid, mom and dad)."
4,No benny any more,"It is fun to watch and also educational to some extent. After watching this video several times, my 22 month old son learned how to count. It was surprisingly quick. But my son keeps following what benny does. He throws stuff to the floor, and yells loudly. I think benny is a nasty character."
1,I'm not satisfied with this purchase,I'm not satisfied with the product's shipping. I bought two similar items and I was specting just one package with both of them but they sent them separtely and the paying bill was higher than the complete cost of my order.
5,Use Your Imagination,"It's the good quality and looks you expect from CorningWare; so what's new?Is an au gratin dish only for au gratin? Who said so? Look at this dish and imagine what you might serve in it. Think hard, and you'll find lots of ideas flowing in.Moi? I thought it looked perfect for making two packages of Jell-O pudding mix look like something special. And it does! Just the right size for when you don't want to bother with separate little bowls.I'm not saying anything against au gratin or potatoes in general; only that this can be a handy dish in your kitchen and dining room."
5,Unbelievable restore options,"Well let me just say they are true to their word when they talk about their restore module.The hard drive on my notebook fried on me. With one single restart, I was able to access all my presentations, local data, a govt bid I had been working on for 2 months now. It was as if I had my hard drive back again. I sent it for product warranty and got it back after about 3 weeks. I restored the image I had been working out off for all this while and its like nothing ever happened. I got it all back with a simple restart.I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone, who has any sort of valuable data."
1,Quality Control Could Be Better,"I agree that the chair is very comfortable for people smaller than average people, and does give the feeling of being weightless. However, the chair I owned had defective welds, which caused the frame to break within a month of purchase. I was fortunate enough to purchase my chair at a place where I could inspect the remaining stock, and several of the chairs they were selling also had defective welds. I would not purchase this chair unless it was from a place that allowed me to carefully inspect the item before buying. One other caveat: the vinyl cover slips on like a fitted sheet. Inspect it carefuly to make sure that the seams are correctly sewn and that the cover will fit well. For the price, it's a decent chair, but for me, there are just too many quality issues to recommend it to anyone."
3,Missing tools,"I got this item shipped to my home fast, then I found out the tools used to assemble it were missing. The customer service was quick on handling to ship me the required tools. However, after a couple of weeks of waiting, the tools arrived to me and I found out that was not the exact tools for this model (I did give her the model of the massage chair)... I can barely assemble this massage chair together with missing bolts etc... I actually tried to sit on it and discovered that the massage roller couldn't reach my lower back even when select to use ""Lower Back"" setting... And my lower back pain is the part bothers me more..."
2,Fitted sheet is NOT deep pocket,"I have a 12"" mattress and a 4"" memory foam topper, so I wanted sheets with 16"" pocket. These are NOT it, about 3-4"" of my mattress shows below the fitted sheet. Also they looked tan here on Amazon but were more of a gold once I got them."
1,Pilled after first wash,"As my title states, these sheets pilled instantly and were irritating to both myself and my husband's skin (cold wash, our usual Planet laundry detergent). I'm hesitant to even cycle these into guest sheets! Definitely expected more from a 600 thread count set."
3,Renaissance Sheets,"My wife ordered these sheets so I'm asking her to review:I really like the weight and feel of the sheets, especially this time of year when the nights are cold. However, I do not care for the pillow cases. They do not iron well and wrinkle easily."
4,Quality Sheets -- Would buy again!,"These sheets are very nice. They put cheaper department store 200 - 300 thread count sheets to shame.We ordered the Cafe' color, which is beautiful. The sheets are heavy and washed great. Very pretty, elegant stitching around pillowcase hem and top sheet adds a nice touch. I had expected the sheets to feel more ""sateen"". Instead, they are moderately heavy and very comfortable.A great buy at a price that cannot be beat!"
2,A little disappointed ...,I thought these were going to be A LOT softer - I have some 600 thread sheets now (much softer) however they were twice the cost. They are very thick and I like the chocolate brown color...
5,Beautiful Sheets,I have had these sheets for a year. I wash them almost every week and they are still in perfect condition. The white is still crisp and they are still soft. Great product.
2,"""cafe"" color is not brown but ugly gold color","Really disappointed in the color of these sheets. ""Cafe"" would bring to mind the color of coffee/latte not a horrible gold color. Sheets bunch up and don't stay tight on the mattress."
4,okay for the price,"i just purchased this set because my mom was visiting me. the sheet set was okay for the price. i've only washed it once since i just received it and it doesn't feel as soft as my old 600tc sheet. i'm hoping that after several more washes it will be softer. as for now, it's good for the price i purchased it for. i would have given it a 5 stars if it was softer. the color was okay..i got ivory and it's a little darker than i expected but still acceptable."
3,600 thread count,"The sheets are nice and were a good deal for the price. I thought that with a 600 thread count they would have been a lot softer. They felt like the normal sheets we have purchased from the stores. When the come out of the dryer they are very wrinkled but when put on the bed the wrinkles work out. Were they worth the money? Yes, they are a nice sheet."
3,it's ok,"The Renaissance 600 Thread-count solid queen sheet set was ok. I was expecting much richer, softer sheets than they are. They'll be very sturdy though, if that's what you want. Maybe after a few more launderings?"
3,Sheet set,"The sheets are very nice, but could be a little smoother, or as my wife puts it, silkier. The price is right for the quality."
3,600tc sheets to lay on...,"These are nice sheets for the price. you must wash them a couple times to really appreciate the quality, But, they are only 600 treadcount, and the colors were limited. I have chocolate and I must say they look better, more stylish than I expected. And the feel is very durrable. Buy them if they are on sale!"
2,Way to stiff,I got these sheets hoping to give me an extra set of super soft sheets. Unfortunately I think it is going to take a hundred washes for the stiffness to wear out. I also cannot stand the way they wrinkle in the dryer. They are really heavy too. I probably should have done more research on 600-thread-count but I know now if you prefer lighter softer sheets these aren't the ones for you.
5,These sheets are awesome,"These sheets feel awesome and I love getting in my bed even more to feel these sheets, I need a set in every color.Saved and sleeping well."
5,high quality for the price,"we normally use between 400 and 500 thread count, one set we do have is 1000 thread count, and these feel just as soft and durable as the more expensive set. the color is a little more bold than pictured (chocolate) but still goes well with our decor. all in all, a great product for the price, we would buy again."
3,love the color but item shrink after the first and more after the next,the color was great but after three washing the sheets won't even fit the bed
2,Did not last as long as I expected,"I bought these sheets from amazon along with a set of 400 thread count from Bed Bath and Beyond for my new bed. They cost about the same amount. I have rotated each set for the last 4 months and am very surprised that the 400 count set feels like new while this 600 thread count set is pilled and rough, they will be going in the rag bag soon and I Will not buy again. Pay the extra money for the 600 thread count from bed bath and beyond."
4,Nice sheets,"The pros:We've been using the Renaissance 600 Thread Count 100% Cotton Sateen King Sheet Set for about a week and we hacv to say that it feels very soft to touch. These are great sheets to sleep on, they are thick but yet they feel soft. A really good thing about these sheets is that they make us feel cooler at night (we live in Cali, Colombia, where the usual tenperature is about 28o C at night, so this has been definitely an advantage for us).The cons:The color is evidently different to the one on the laptop screen. I would say it has more green than blue.They wrinkle more than other sheet sets, but I don't find this as a real problem since anyway everybody sleeps with their eyes closed."
1,Very Poor Quality,"Very poor quality - nothing like sateen at all . Very hard , impossible to iron , wrinkled all the time , nothing like the color that u expect / want , harsh on the skin .I don t recommend this product . At all ."
3,Different runs seem to be hit or miss,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the softness factor with these sheets seems to be hit or miss. Perhaps the threads are from different places or made at different times. I was hoping I would be lucky and get some of the ""soft"" ones people reviewed, but unfortunately, I did not. The sheets do feel thicker as if they are a better quality, but they are not softer than even cheaper or lower thread counts I have purchased. I do like the color of the sheet, I got the chocolate ones, and I will still use them because I think they are fine, just don't expect extra softness, even after multiple washings. All in all, these sheets are fine and do feel durable, and for the price I am really not that disappointed."
3,Two years later....,"Ordered King, Cafe two years ago, and multiple washes ago, and here is my review: Very durable, even after many washings, these sheets will last for years to come. Not really soft or silky, no matter what detergent/softeners I use, so if that's what you're looking for, they may be a bit stiff for you. For people who say they are soft and silky right out of the box, that is true....but once you wash them, they kinda stiffen up. The Cafe is gold, not a coffee color, as I had expected....but it's not unattractive. I just don't know why they call it Cafe....it's very different than the color you see on the website. If I had to pick one word to describe, I'd say: DURABLE."
5,sheet set,"I previously purchased two sets of deep pocket queen size sheets for a waterbed with a soft top mattress. Neither of the queen sized sheet sets fit the waterbed (bottom sheet). I can't get them on it. It is frustrating and I have to rely on my husband to do it and this is not easy for him, either. So I went to king sized fitted sheets and they actually fit the bottom. They are a little big, the top sheet is uber-big. BUT they fit. They are also smooth and satiny and wonderfully cool at night. I love them."
3,Just ok... kinda scratchy,"I got these sheets in sage green color for a thick, california king bed. They are just ok.THE GOOD: The color was fine; sorta mint-colored. They have a nice sateen sheen (even after several washings).THE BAD: They were a bit scratchy (even after several washings). I had expected soft and luxurious, the kind of sheets that feel nice to lay down on. These are not like that.Furthermore, the fitted sheet barely fits over my deep pillow-top mattress (I have to wrestle it on every time, and they still don't come all the way over the corners).The tailoring isn't very high quality: for instance, the piping at the top edge of the flat sheet has gaps in the green thread where the white piping shows through. I've heard others talk of a satin trim on the queen size. I didn't get a satin trim on the king.I'm not going to return these because I paid less than forty bucks for the cal. king size. For that price, they are ok sheets. I wouldn't pay more though."
3,Not worth the price,"These sheets are stiff after washing 10 -12 times. The fitted sheet is short and narrow, I can't pull the corners over the mattress corners by 3 or more inches at each corner. Most of my sheets have a fitted sheets and have ample room in the corners so it is not my mattress. I think they sold it as a queen but it was a standard fitted. Not a good seller to me."
5,Great Value!,"These sheets are very comfortable. After one washing they were very soft. They seem to be very good quality. You can't beat these for the price. My mattress is 15"" with a 3"" memory foam pad, and the sheets barely fit. I would highly recommend!"
2,Renaissance Sheets,They are not quite what I expected. They wrinkle very easily. Would not order them again.
5,Meets expectations,"The sheets are an even color and with a pleasant texture. They've been laundered repeatedly and have kept their ""new"" look."
3,CALIFORNIA KING,"These sheets are just ok, nice and stiff which hopefully make them last longer, the pillow cases are ""not"" king size but they seem to fit standard / queen pillows, for the price you should get the true king size pillow cases"
2,Better off going to Goodwill,"I saw the multitude of positive reviews and popularity of these sheets and thought I was safe to purchase them online. A month into using my king sheet set and I already know that I was wrong. The main flaw with this product that I have found is that the fitted sheet has already started to pill up, creating an unpleasant texture to snuggle into at the end of the day. The pillow cases and top sheet are holding up fine thus far--but one would expect any product to hold up after a month of normal use. I am hoping to return these sheets and may just go down to a local Goodwill and see if there are any sheets there that I can give a good washing to and use. At least then I'll know that they have been used without balling up. Quite disappointing. I'd highly recommend looking for a different product."
1,"After Three Washes, Starts Pilling","Despite this being a 600 thread count set, it only took three washes to start pilling. This should not happen with a set like this."
1,Soft but low quality,I thought these were the same as some other sheet that I ordered but they're not. They're much softer than my other ones of the same brand but after just a few weeks they started getting little fabric balls on them and became rough in certain sections. Wouldnt reccomend them at all.
3,ed johnson,Good quality sheets but I was not aware that they were sateen so this is another word for not as good as a regular 600 thread count sheet however still good qauality.
3,High thread count sheets,"Not a bad buy, comfortable to sleep on. A good fitting sheet. Cafe color is not what we expected, has a bit of an orangish hue. Other than that the only other complaint is that they come out of the dryer very wrinkled."
4,Smooth Sheets,"These sheets are great, I love the way the feel on my skin. I sleep much better when these are on my bed and they don't make me itch like lower count ones."
4,Thick and durable,"Not quite what I expected from sateen, but I like them. The more I wash them the more I like them, and the chocolate brown matches my dog's fur, which is quite handy between washings, lol. This is a thicker sheet than what I'm used to, and not particularly soft but an excellent value."
2,Stitching fell apart,"This fabric is soft and comfy, but the corner stitching on the fitted sheet (one corner, about 8 inches long) fell apart the first time I washed it. Also, the ""cafe"" color is much more of a dark mustard."
2,It's not worth the $,"Sorry but I bought these sheets on Amazon a few months ago and hesitated writing a review initially because I wanted to give them a ""break-in"" period and be fair.I have had smoother more Sateen feeling sheets from Sam's club than these. Save your money and buy something else, these are rough, and don't feel Sateen at all, (they would make decent curtains though)."
2,DOES NOT FIT DEEP POCKET MATTRESS AS STATED,"THESE SHEETS APPEAR TO BE VERY GOOD QUALITY AND FEEL VERY NICE, BUT THEY DO NOT FIT DEEP POCKET MATTRESSES AS INDICATED. I HAVE A SLEEP NUMBER BED, AND HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH SHEETS FITTING UNTIL THESE."
4,Excellent sheets for the $39.99 Price,"I bought these sheets for $39, during a DOTD sale, and I've very pleased with them. They are slightly rougher, as a previous reviewer mentioned, but with some washings, they should be fine. And yes, they do get wrinkly, but I am not a wrinkle freak, and not expecting Martha Stuart to drop by to do a random sheet inspection, so doesn't bother me :) Overall, very good deal on some great sheets! If you're not expecting super soft, wrinkle-free sheets, go for it."
3,Not good for Pillow Tops at all,"I have a brand new queen size pillow top mattress, and wanted comfy sheets for it. These sheets are quite comfortable, very soft and thick. However, the fitted sheet doesn't fit on the mattress and the regular sheet can't be tucked into the sides at all. It's very hard to find sheet sets to fit these newer thick pillow tops."
1,Not reliable at all,"I ordered these on December 5 and now Xmas has come and gone, and still no sheets. Thanks for nothing, literally. Don't buy these sheets--they will put a damper on your Xmas if you do. God, this sucks."
2,Disappointing,"When I 1st received these sheets they felt exactly as they should, soft, satin like. Unfortunately, upon washing, the wrinkled up (that I can handle), but became so scratchy, I couldn't sleep on them. I got up in the middle of the night and changed sheets!I guess I expected something more from 600 thread count and sateen."
4,Great for Summer,These sheets were light and not heavy so it's perfect for summer. Not to much to say but I would definitly order them again. They feel good and makes my bed look nice.
3,after 6 months started pilling,"bought these sheets because of high thread count and relatively low price. alas, you get what you pay for. the sheets have been pilling, so the once smooth, sateen feel is gone in large spots."
5,better than i could have guessed,"I had been looking at sheets in the stores that were over 300 thread count and i just could not spend the money. then i found these on amazon for a less then a third of the price of what i was finding at L&T. I was afraid of two things too slick, and when they arrived too thick...they are soft, not slick, and the most comfortable thing i have on my bed."
2,600 thread count? Maybe but...,"It seems strong, durable and possibly soft after a few washes, but it hasn't gotten soft! I purchased these 7 months ago and have been using them almost entirely! They are scratchy, wrinkles like crazy (normally I don't care, but this is ridiculous) and on my husband's side it pilled so badly I want to take a sweater shaver to it. Don't waste your money! Very disappointed!"
2,Dull and very pilled after 2nd washing,"I loved these sheets when I first received them and would have written a glowing review then. However, now that I have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled. They look terrible but I haven't slept on them yet since they pilled so I don't know how that will feel. Hopefully it won't be noticeable. No one sees these sheets other than me and my husband, but I am very disappointed with these considering I've had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that haven't reacted this way. By the way, I ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want. Maybe it's possible that certain colors pill and some don't? I have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also."
5,"WONDERFUL, SOFT , BRINGING SWEET DREAMS",I've bought 3 sets of these and I must admit me and my husband are greatly happy. The colors are vibrant - they look like million dollars on bed and the sheets are so soft with satin coolness that they are my favorite sheets ever.
4,Buy the updated version of these sheets,"I purchased a queen set in chocolate and a cafe colored set in the newer version of this sheet set-they have the stripe. The newer version is much nicer, softer, etc. and has a stripe in the weave. Both sets fit loosely even for an oversized queen mattress with a memory foam topping. I'm sure they'll shrink when washed. This set is less satiny so if that is important to you....I'm now purchasing 2 more queen sets of the newer version but this is still a very good value sheet set for 600 thread count. You just can't purchase a similar set anywhere for less and these are tax/shipping free. I recommend; 4 stars only because the other set is so much nicer...."
3,"not bad, mine arrived with a hole in it","They're not super soft sheets. They're all right, they're decent sheets. I needed to replace my own sheets badly so I ordered these off Amazon. Unfortunately there was a hole in one of the pillowcases so I can't use that pillowcase. Seeing as how I only have one pillow its not that big of a deal, the other pillowcase was in good condition. Anyway, would I buy these again? No. If you have money, get softer sheets. These are not soft, they're somewhat rough. Anyway since I was so desperate for a replacement they will do their job until I can get better sheets."
1,Queen Fitted Sheet Too Tight,"Bottom (fitted) sheet is very difficult to put on. Sheet is barely large enough to fit on mattress, and elastic far too tight to stretch over four corners. I have been using them for several months, thinking the elastic would stretch - it has NOT.Unfortunately I purchased two sets and both have the same issue."
1,Horrible sheets,Ridiculously stiff sheets and definitely feels NOTHING like sateen sheets. Even after washing with fabric softener still did not help.
2,Not soft,These sheets are not soft. They are grainy feeling. I have washed them with lots of softener and that did not help. They are also thin. It is my fault for not paying attention. These are NOT Egyptian cotton.
4,Great Sheets,"Very satisfied with these sheets for the price. They are very soft and comfortable, not hard or slippery. I have noticed some piling after a couple washes, nothing major. I would buy again."
2,They are really small,"I love the look and feel of these sheets, they are of great quality. They are not, however, large enough to fit on a queen size mattress. I would have returned them, but I am a single guy, and I thought maybe after a wash or two they would stop bending my mattress so I threw the packaging away. It's probably my fault for not returning them immediately, but I would buy them again if they actually fit because I love the way they feel. If you buy them hang on to the packaging and do not hesitate to send them back if they don't fit immediately!"
3,"Good and sturdy, but stiff","These sheets are good, but they are quite stiff after the first washing. They make a funny paper-like sound when we move around on them. I'm hoping that they'll soften up with use and washings, but we haven't been using them long enough to be sure they will. Either way, though, they are comfortable, and I'd buy them again."
4,pretty good sheets,"No complaints, and they seem to get more comfortable with additional washings. Definitely not wrinkle-free, but I wasn't expecting them to be."
5,I Love it!,"I recently read about BOOM in Billboard magazine --they gave ""one Hour Talisman"" best progressive album of the year--so I checked it out though it was very complex the guitar playing in particular was really great. I have their first cd ..SQUINT which I like even better cause on that disc the guitrist anthony curtis really unleashes his power and chops. But hey it is great anyway i advise them to return to the earlier type of stuff though.Thomas Raines Atlanta"
5,Favorite book!,This is my son's all-time favorite book. He loved it from a few months of age through about 3 years old. Would recommend to anyone with little kids! A really fun read!
3,Be Careful Which Version You Buy!,"Dr. Seuss' original book is a wonderful, rhythmic book. That book is suggested for children four to eight years old. It is NOT the same as the Bright and Early Board Book which will pull the same reviews here on Amazon.com as the original book!The board book is an abridged version of the Dr. Seuss favorite. It is not a bad book (my son has fun with the board book which he received as a gift and likes to hear grandma make the sounds Mr. Brown makes). However, it is in no way as detailed as the original (no gum-chewing hippo for example) and the rhythm doesn't quite ""work"" in some places (""...He can sound like a bee. Mr Brown can buzz. How about you? Can you buzz? ..."").If I could separate my reviews I would give the Bright and Early Board book Two Stars and the Dr. Seuss original Four Stars. Perhaps if I didn't know that the board book was abridged I'd give it a higher score, but if you wish to make the better purchase, I'd suggest you go with the original."
1,Buy the original; not the board book,The board book version is a watered down mishmash of the original. All the fun of Dr. Suess's original rhymes and rhythms is lost making this nothing more than an expensive chew toy for your infant. Buy the original and keep some scotch tape handy!
3,Colours the water,Washes off fine but colours your bathtub water - I used clean water to wash my children and had to wash away a 'ring' from the colour as well
3,Best and Worst of them all,"I have in the past tried and reviewed Alex Bath CrayonsRub a Dub Draw In The Tuband Edushape bath crayonsEdushape Bath Crayons. Both products, while fun for the kids, have their share of problems. I was counting on a trusted brand like Crayola to put out a quality product, but alas.The Crayola product is the best in class when it comes to usability. The crayon is well constructed and easy to use. It writes cleanly and there is not much crayon dust or crumbling into pieces. But all this comes at a price. The Crayola crayons are by far the hardest to clean up. If you forget to clean it soon after its used, good luck in getting it off. It is a painful process and takes a while getting it off the tub.So based on your patience and willingness to let the kid write with the best bath tub crayon and the subsequent cleaning process, this could be the best or worst experience."
5,They are a hit!!,"My 20mth old loves these things!! She had forgotton all of her other bath toys for the Yo Gabba Gabba bath foams..now those are all but forgotten with these crayons. I've even found her in the shower during ""non-shower"" times drawing on the wall...If the walls are already really wet, they don't work well. For us, the crayon comes off very easily and clean. I've even been able to wash the drawings off the next day with out any problem. Even my toddler can wipe the walls clean herself with a washrag. They will ""melt"" if left in the water. Our tiles are a dark tan so the very light crayon colors don't show up. Wish they had refills available.."
2,Disintegrates,"Cool idea. Horrible execution.The crayons are super soft, hence the plastic tube used to support them. But they fall out of the tube and disintegrate into useless mess.Don't waste your time."
1,Hope you like scrubbing!,"Our 3 and 5 year olds had a great time with these in the tub. When I went to remove them from the walls around the tub, the crayons came off the tile okay but only came off the grout with a serious combination of elbow grease, bleach-based cleaner, and time. Grout is definitely stained and not sure whether more scrubbing will take the stains off. I would definitely prefer crayons that were made of soap."
2,the buster keaton part. . . .,"Buster Keaton was NOT abused as a child. He himself had stated this many times in his life. He was literally strip-searched in front of both the mayor and governer of New York of his time to show the brusies and injuries on his person which were NOT THERE. Also to think about, Buster's father, Joe Keaton, was mostly angered by the fact that the social group going after their stage act, didn't protect or help the homeless and penniless children of 1910s New York and instead went after Buster who had both parents, friends, a steady job, and thought the roughhousing was a lot of fun. Remember this while reading."
2,N ot impressed,"Disappointing. Only a small portion of the book is devoted to plays that children can perform themselves. The handful of plays in this section provide a good example of the multiculturism fad in kids' books these days. The plays are identified as coming from several different countries. But this supposedly diverse group of plays is uniformly unentertaining, with little or no educational content."
3,Great Film Marred by Lack of Letterbox,"Probably Duval's career-defining performance. I purchased this DVD with the great joyful anticipation of someone who wants to share something wonderful (my wife had never seen the film), yet was very disappointed that the DVD was not in letterbox format. Without letterbox I might as well buy VHS tapes. Anyway, this does not detract from the greatness of Duval, Blythe Danner and Michael O'Keefe."
2,Superb film spoiled by DVD full-screen formatting,"'The Great Santini' is a compelling drama superbly produced, written, filmed, directed and acted (in it I think Duvall gives his finest performance, and he's ably supported by everyone in the cast). Unfortunately, the DVD release in ""full-screen"" format cheats viewers of the fine cinemaphotography and thus of the impact of the whole effort: thus I rate the disc two stars and recommend against buying or renting it.About a month ago on late night television - on one of those high-numbered UHF stations - I saw the widescreen version of this film and this version begs to be transferred lovingly to widescreen DVD."
1,Don't waste your money,"I expected much more from a professional photographer. I expected to be in awe, but that wasn't the case at all. I think you can go to [...] and see Blythe pics that will truly inspire you for free. I'm returning this one!Definite waste of money!"
5,The best book for parents wishing to raise happy kids.,"My friend gifted it to me without exactly knowing its real value. I had previously read Dr Dyer's books (Your Erroneous Zones, Ths Sky is the Limit, etc.). Anticipating the same wisdom and guidance, I read the book. It was wonderful. I had always thought on the same line and wished that I personally could have been raised by my parents in the manner described by Dr Dyer. This book is my parenting guide for lifetime. Thank you Dr Dyer."
1,An Annoying Way to Wake Up,"I've had this clock for about a year, and wonder why I haven't thrown it into a wall yet - or better yet, into the trash. Initially it worked as it was supposed to. Then, after a few months, it decided it would only play a certain few of my CDs. I thought I could live with that. Wrong. Now it plays the first track on the CD as it's supposed to, but after that, only whirrs and grinds futilely as it tries in vain to find a next random track to play. But it is NOT set on Random Play. It should simply play the next track on the CD, not seek a random track. If you want to be awakened by constant annoying, electronic buzzing and grinding, then this is the clock for you. Too bad the Amazon review system requires that I give this at least one star. I'd rather give it none. I think I'll go toss mine in the trash right now."
3,Seems like they all stink,"I was looking to replace this cd/clock radio, for the same reasons listed in many of these reviews...the cd player slowly became disfunctional. Mine has lasted about a year. Looking over the other choices, I cant say the reviews are much better. so in the end I say...it has quite good features, easy to read display & dual alarm, however dont expect the cd player to last. This year im going to try Phillips....RCA - get your act in gear - you have a nice design - add another buck to the cost and make it quality!"
1,Horrible!!!,"I got this camera as a gift after my fuji discovery was stolen last year. I was expecting my second child and not in the mood to take pictures until she was born 6months later. Needless to say I should have taken pictures with this camera sooner, because it was too late to return it! The pictures are horrible! The camera does not focus fast enough to capture those split second funny faces a newborn makes... I am very dissappointed in this camera. All of my pictures are blurry and of nothing significant. If I could I would return this camera in a heartbeat. I am now buying a new camera and giving this one to my three year old to ""play with""."
2,Forget close ups!,"I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a camera store owner because of some special lens it supposedly has. It doesn't take any better pictures than other cameras I have owned and it is sooo difficult to get it to focus on anything! I had a baby recently and most of my early pictures of her are completely blurred because of this camera's inability to focus, especially close up. I'm going to return it and trade it for a Pentax which always takes close ups well. I agree with the shutter release delay everyone else is having a problem with also."
2,"""lite touch"" makes it difficult","I had read some great reviews of this camera (on amazon)before I bought it, but now I see why the rating has changed from a 5star to a 3star. The lite touch seemed like an attractive feature, but its a pain. Its fine if you dont need to use the flash, but most of the time you have to keep clicking and watching an internal light go from green to red green to red. If you press for too long, you cant take the photo - if you dont press long enough, the photo opp. is gone (this has happened to me MANY times. Save the... dollars and go with a pentax."
4,Check this CD out,"I'm very impressed with this CD. I usually download my music but I had to buy this CD. I've always been a big fan of Keith Sweat. Some people did't like him because they say he whines in his music. My stand on that is if you are a true Keith Sweat fan, none of that mattered. Whining has always been his style I mean come on, isn't that what made the women hot all over? His new ""Just Me"" CD is straight on with alot less whining for all the haters. The first time I put it in my car I was like wow! Keith is back in full affect with this new hit just like the oldschool jams he would woo the ladies with and put the fellas in the mood. Keith is back ladies and gentlemen! Big ups!"
5,Just Me,"I have every Keith Sweat CD that has come out and if i had to pick my top 3 this one is on my list.You dont hear music today like this,so smooth and perfect to sing to your special someone."
4,Good intentions but who is the writer trying to impress?,"I had to use this book at college for communications courses and at the time, it was difficult to follow and remember salient points. It's a classic example of an author writing for his colleagues and not for actual people. The language is too high-falutin' for the average college student. Sad, but true. But I come back to it every couple of years, and it becomes easier to understand. I suggest that it be issued as part of a graduate course instead of an undergraduate course."
2,Get a different book instead,"This book is highly repetitive and focuses way too much on a single example project throughout the book. Instead of starting off with an overview about the technology and iteratively getting more detailed, information is organized almost like an API spec. The first few chapters were written in an interesting and exciting manner, but it was disappointing beyond that."
2,A disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book when I found it. Like most others, I gave up after 3 chapters. I found too many defiencies in the code in the book so I downloaded the source from the publisher. That helped, then I found the classpath explained in the book had left out several items. Finally figured out the classpath issues, and got the code to compile fully, but was unable to deploy due to other defiencies so I gave up.Some good points... It does explain EJBs well, just not how to deploy them properly. The exploration of UCs should benefit anyone. And it does show how to use deploytool, for whatever that is worth"
4,You know somethings wrong only your cat loves you.......,I loved this book. It is not like most of the other romances I've read and it definantly wasn't really mushy. I would have to say some of the situations in this book are common in real life. Janice Kay Johnson's descriptions about certain things make you feel like you're there and you're one of the main characters. I would naturally read this book again and again over a period of time of course. But I really liked it because I used a lot of description and it doesn't leave you hanging at the end which is really nice. I also really like this book because I love to read and if I can't get stuck in the book it bugs me. And I had a problem putting the book down after I got into it.This is by far one of the best romances I have ever read.
1,"Rapture - romantic, powerful -wonderful.",The response to his music is visceral. Wonderfully romantic. Has great texture and depth. A pallette full of color and richness.
1,trash,This is NOT a book for most 13 year olds. My 16 year old saw my 13 yo reading it and took it away from her. She told me how disgusting it was and I have to agree. What a disappointment from this author whose previous tween works were so enjoyed.
1,Innapropriate for young teens,"As someone else said if I could rate it zero stars I would. The premise of this book is cute, however the unnecessary sexual details are not. Do not recommend for young teens ..."
1,Terrible book,"The opitomy of sexualizing our youth, what at joke. Good luck justifying this garbage."
3,a gr8 book,"Maddie, Zoey, and Angela are BFFs. As they start 10th grade, they share their tears and fears via IM. Angela, the beauty, is thrilled to have a new boyfriend. When she starts having problems with him, her friends try to convince her of what a jerk he is, but she can't let go. Zoe, the good girl, starts to get involved with a youth group. The problem is that her teacher is hitting on her, and she's the only one who can't see it. Maddie, the cynic, gets involved with a popular girl, ignoring her friends warning. When all 3 girls get in trouble, will they find solace in each other, or will their friendship collapse?"
1,Would have given it one star if that was allowed.,"After a few pages, my 11 yo daughter put the book down with such force that I had to acknowledge it. When I asked what was wrong, she said something is really wrong with this book. I picked it up to read her last passage and I am so insulted, I can't believe this author. I can't keep authors from writing this, but I can warn parents about this book. My daughter was insulted and she didn't even know how deeply she should have been insulted.My 16 yo daughter looked at it briefly and she too was amazed that this author could publish something like this for girls. I had to return the book to the school library because neither one of them wanted to get dirty by touching it."
1,The literary equivalent of the all-twinkie diet,"A perfect book for morons destined to drop out of school at 15 stoned and pregnant. If that's your aspiration for your kids, by all means buy this book for them. This book has no redeeming value what-so-ever; I tossed our copy (I'm ashamed that I didn't look more closely when my daughter bought it) in the recycling bin after my daughter came to me suggesting that, perhaps, it wasn't appropriate for her. She was right. It's not appropriate for anyone. It is trash."
1,I wanted more,"I bought the book a few months ago and just now got around to reading it... I loved the idea of the format, i do alot of instant messaging myself and thought the idea of a book written in instant messages sounded fun... It isnt a good idea tho, the book lacked details that it needed and the story line just wasnt there.. Maybe I am to old for these books now... but seriously, there wasnt any strontg plot lines to keep you intrested... i would have liked to seen alot more withg the Zoe/Mr. H story line... that could have been intresting... in all, the book wasnt very good... I was disappointed with it... it was just plan BORNING!"
2,"Easy read, very 'typical'. Lame.","This book was okay, but unremarkable in every way. It is THE epitome of a 'teen girl' fiction. You could see what was coming a mile ahead, like a train bearing down on you. Each girl has their own little 'crisis' that is set up from the very beginning.I didn't relate to the characters at ALL. Keep in mind, I'm a 16-year-old girl. If not me, who are they looking for? I found all the characters one-dimensional, foolish, and they each had one neat character cliche to fit into.The whole thing was fake, obvious, and contained all the cliches that could possibly be stuffed in.It was on easy read-if you're used to the chatspeak-and mildly entertaining, when I wasn't busy being annoyed by how ridiculous it all was."
2,Eh,"I have not actually read the entire book but from reading some of it out of boredom from my sister's copy I can conclude that it is a sub-par book. Although the page setup is creative, the wording used is hard to follow even though I am a regular user of aim and by formatting the whole book into conversations you don't understand the main characters enough. Also many of the pages are just them ranting about absolutely nothing. I say this as a firm believer of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" but when my sister bought this book I grimaced at the cover and the summary on the back and when I read the first page it was like rubbing salt into my wound."
1,Editor/Publisher,"I am so very disappointed in this book. It is full of grammatical errors, missing words, commas, incorrect tense, two words used where it looks like one should have been selected - almost like the editor was supposed to look and choose one. Makes is difficult to read and does not give it as much credibility as would a well edited text. Horribly written/edited."
5,WOW! WHAT A GAME!,Midnight Club 2 is one of the best games I ever played! And I thought Midnight Club was good. This is amazing. I don't have the game yet but i played it at a friends house.Who ever thought of this game is the best.IT IS HOT!
5,midnightclub ll,amine menadlii have played this game many times i did not even get board of it a rate this game ten out of ten the graphics has some amazing features you can see like the neww susuzi moterbike.thank you for listining to my view
3,Midnight club 2,The game is very exciting when you are racing against Online and against the computer. On the game you can customize your car to whatever you want it to look like and the decals are sickerning.
2,NOT WHAT I HAD HOPED FOR,"I had hoped these would be like the ones you buy from the Jelly Belly group but these arae more of a jelly (not gummi - at all) - I've had the cola and cherries by Haribo, but these are NOT like that. I'm very DISAPPOINTED!!"
5,A Slice of Home,"I am German and was thrilled to find these on Amazon. My husband, who is actually American, loves the Haribo berries! And they are absoulutely fresh and the best value anywhere!!"
2,cheap youll get use to it,bought a lot of in a sale 10 cents the bag and at the beginning when first tasting it was like like eating plastic cheap plastic but since im to cheap to throw away 5 dollars i keep eating them by the end i wanted more so i guess youll get use to anything
3,Certain Types,"This movie has a certain type of gay man. And it is one that I'm glad I'm not. Interesting to see a subset of people in a certain culture but after it was done, I was glad I wasn't any of them. I don't deny that I try my best to look good (whatever that is, at least to feel confident). But I'm glad that I try not to judge others the way most of these men seem to do. I don't resent any of them, and I wish happiness for all of them but at the end of the day, it just seems like SO much unnecessary effort to maintain an image based on how others perceive you, based on looks rather than the content of your character."
1,Two pages of content packed into just 188 pages!,"There must be some value to this thesis, but I haven't found it. A two page summary of TRIPS would have sufficed."
1,cheap bearings - useless,"I seldom write reviews unless something is really great or really lousy. This fan was bought as a replacement for a unit that had been getting noisier and noisier - you know the sound I'm talking about - you can tell a fan is on its last legs when it begins to sound like it has pebbles for bearings.So after a couple of years of procrastination, I ordered this fan, installed it, turned on the switch and was very pleased with myself for having followed through. It was quiet for about five minutes, then began to rumble so loudly I could hear it like a freight train through the timbers of the house two floors away. Now I just don't use the bathroom fan at all.So much for my efforts. I would've been better leaving the old fan alone. And so would YOU if you're thinking about buying this product.Stay away. Noisy and cheap. VERY VERY noisy."
1,Start to skip after one year,It worked fine before being one year old.CD player keeps skipping. Now I'm looking for another boombox.
2,I was not impressed,I bought this item to use while exercising. My main complaint is the lack of volume. The volume is just too low even on the maximum setting. This might be a good feature for you parents but it does not work for me.
1,Wrong listing,Eric Roberts isn't in this movie. Neither is Elise Donovan. Amazon won't change this. I purchased this movie for Eric Roberts. What a waste of money! Eric and Elise were in Wolves of Wall Street.Wolves of Wall Street
5,Incredible...,"Classic era Genesis. As always, the musicianship is top notch.Phil Collins plays the drums like they owe him money!If you like Genesis LIVE, you'll love this. Worth the price!"
