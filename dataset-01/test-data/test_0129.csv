1,Make it stop...,"Did Clancy actually write this book? I know that nowadays some writers lend their names to books that they conceptualized, but didn't write, and this seems like one of them. Nothing like the Clancy of old. Achingly boring, dull, pedantic, any word you can throw out there that means ""bad"" or ""not worth your time"" is applicable to this monstrosity."
1,the more things change...,"Looks like a manuscript that was rejected in his early days, and pulled out of the bottom drawer to cash in on his current popularity.It would have been interesting to see how a Bulgarian Aparatnik recruits a Turkish hit-man, but we never do. A little therapy might clear up that fear of flying."
2,Sleeping won't be a problem,"Dull and uneventful have never described Clancy's books until now. If not for his writing style and my love for Jack Ryan's world, I would have tossed this book after the first 100 pages. In fact, the book could have been about 300 pages shorter and would have the same impact for the reader.Not intriguing. Not interesting. Not thrilling. A few fun tidbits. But way too much Ryan talking about his financial savvy, kids glued to VCRs, and topics discussed repeatedily when once would have had a better effect.Of course, Clancy sets up his next book when it appears Jack Ryan will be an instrumental part in Reagan's plan to out spend Russia and crush their economy. So unless you're an econ major, that will be a snoozer."
3,Would have been better without Ryan,"I have always been a big fan of Clancy's books, both fiction and non-fiction, but this one really does drag. I think an earlier reviewer had it right when suggesting that the overall story would be improved if Jack Ryan were simply removed from the story. I know some Ryan fans will disagree, but his contribution to the story is primarily to go back and forth to work in London, talk to his co-workers over beers, talk to his wife and eventually tag along on a mission. I found myself skipping the Ryan sections of the book to get on to the plot involving the Foley's and the ""Rabbit"", which was much more interesting."
2,stopped at page 84,"I've noticed Clancy's novels gradually losing their pizazz, and this one is no different. After 80 pages of boredom I came to this web site to see if it was worth pursuing the next 600 pages and obviously from the customer reviewers the answer is a resounding NO. Read Daniel Silva instead."
2,Mediocre,"This book is quite interesting and has its moments, though very few and far between, but it is quite possibly his worst novel.I actually enjoyed this one over The Bear and the Dragon but its about 300 pages too long. Its repetitive, long winded, and lacks suspense as everything is easy to figure out.When the defection finally happens, after about 500 pages of talking about it, it lacks that special something. The escape and Pope scene, which are the two main points of the book, both turn out bland and not that exciting when they happen.I hope Teeth of the Tiger, Clancy's last Ryanverse novel, turns out well because The Bear and now the Rabbit have been real stinkers."
1,Red Rabbit,"A BIG disappointment! Sure there is Clancy's trademark attention to detail and manly repartee, BUT... This failure of the imagination offers none of the panoramic excitement and suspense to be found in RED STORM RISING, et al.One would think that a big event like the attempted murder of the Pontifex Maximus would provide the framework for a robust tale, not the anemic one found in RED RABBIT."
2,A 100-page story squeezed into 618 pages......,"Very disappointing.Writing a book about a popular character in a setting 20-years ago, a writer can make them look omniscient. Examples in this book: Having invested in Starbucks, the Japanese ecomonmy is riding for a fall, the Soviet economy is very shaky (and even the internal reports gloss over the problems) - all these in the very early part of the book. In this book, even Jack's inward thoughts are almost completely error free. This happened in other Jack Ryan books, but not in this concentration.And then, as it becomes clear how little is actually going to happen in this entire 618-page tome, the shock sets in: That's all there is?Few plot threads, mostly uninteresting characters. I hope the next one is better....."
1,"It's coming... it's coming... it's coming... Nope, never did","Clancy must have written this one from left-over notes and in a few spare moments here and there. Lot's of opportunities for the suspensful plot twists and turns of his early novels, but it never happens here. We do get a lot of detail about what the characters have for breakfast and how difficult the transition is for Ryan's ""eye-cutter"" wife to operate in Britain vs. the USA. A big disappointment for Clancy fans."
2,A Poor Effort for a Great Author,This book took almost half of it's length getting started. It was good when it finally got started but way too much of the book was quite dry. Unusual for Clancy. It's like Clancy was just trying to fill most of the pages.Glad I read it but it was not the book you'd expect from Clancy and I don't recommend it.
2,Not as bad as all that,"Yes, it seemed like capitalist propaganda. Yes, we all know how it's going to come out if we're middle aged and if we've read the newspapers since we've been adults. Yes, Clancy has done way better in all the books he actually wrote except for ""Rainbow Six"". Yes, he's pretty heavy handed about advertising his previous book, ""Patriot Games"". But some Clancy fans will want to read ""Red Rabbit"" anyway. Most of life is not an extreme thriller, and so, I suppose, is Jack Ryan's life. ""Red Rabbit"" is not as bad as the ""Net Force"" books that he phones in."
1,save your money,You could start this book at page 400. The first 399 pages are filled with drivel. This is Clancy's worst.
4,Not quite....,"This may not be one of Clancy's best, and it definately is a slow starter. It does have a predictable ending, however. In the middle, though, one is just not sure what will happen next. If you have read all of Clancy's books with Jack Ryan as the main character, then some of the information on places, dates, etc don't wuite make sense. It seems this book was written to describe Ryan's actions after Patriot Games and befre Executive Orders, but exactly where, one is not sure. The book is an interesting read though and if you are a Jack Ryan afficianado then of course you have to have this for your collection."
2,Clancy's Red Rabbit and homage to Ron,"This book was largely a disappointment. It lacked pace and focus, and was basically an uninteresting story. I kept waiting for it to get going but it never really did. This is especailly disappointing after Executive Orders - which was a wonderful book. Also, Tom Clancy contiues in his ridiculous assertion that Ronald Reagan was directly responsible for the end of communism in the Soviet Union and actually writes it into part of the plot. This is just wrong for so many reasons that I'd get carpal tunnel trying to type it all out. Suffice to say that the idea that Ronald Reagan ended the cold war is idiotic and not true. Tom needs to get back to writing books with interesting plots, moral complexities, and even handed political views."
1,Just putting ink on paper,"After reading his last three books, I am convinced that Clancy and his publishers are all about just getting ink on paper and money from the masses. Clancy doesn't even proof read his work. He descibes the hills of Pest and the plains of Buda. The last time I was in Hungary Buda had the hill and Pest was farm land. Come on Tom at least visit the city you write about!As for the story, its too historical and predictable.For a major publisher and a centerpiece release there were way too many typos in the copy I received. I felt taken after reading it"
2,Highly Disappointing,"Until publication of this book, I would have chosen Tom Clancy as my favorite author without hesitation. All of the reviews that cite the lack of excitement, constant repetition and endless rhetoric are dead on target. And for those who attribute this failure to the difficulties of writing a prequel, I refer you to Without Remorse, which was an excellent piece. Bottom line: I have always finished each of Clancy's prior works within 48 hours; this one took me a week, and I had to force myself to complete it. I hope this is a fluke and not the end of the Jack Ryan books, but I would prefer that Clancy never write another Jack Ryan novel rather than publish another work of this caliber."
2,Disappointed - 2 year wait for this?!?,"Before I discuss this book, I want to say that I have read every novel Tom Clancy has written and loved them all. I look forward (for years sometimes) for his next book.This book was a real disappointment. The plot was shallow, the ending was too easy, and everything was just too simple. Going from earlier novels of multiple plots that weave together to a grand combination... this book falls flat.I recently read an interview with Tom Clancy where he discusses this book. He mentions that this is the first book he wrote without smoking a cigarette. Perhaps, like the character Jack Ryan himself, he should sneak a few to help him with his thought process.The next novel Tom Clancy writes I will also purchase as soon as Amazon.com can ship it BUT, if its like this one, it will be the last time I buy a Clancy novel until I see everyone is raving about it!"
1,Biggest disappointment of the year,"And I was so looking forward to this.Bear and the Dragon was slower then previous books but I did not realise it was the start of the Clancy sleepwalking years. Clancy has chosen a scenario where the tension is lost because we already know the outcome. Where pace and tension might have been added to the plot, Clancy slows things down into turgid detail and needless repetition. On a purely intellectual basis, insights into the Russion mind set and international espionage might be interesting, but not there does not seem much else. I'm British and his views on Merry Olde England in the early 80's were quite accurate, but who cares unless they are put into context of the overall story!Astonishingly this is a thriller by perhaps the biggest name in the business and he fails to deliver one single thrill in the entire book. A terrible effort."
2,Surely Overblown,"The man who wrote the gripping 'The Search for Red October' has fallen a long way in producing this 900 pages of pure boredom. This book could be improved by taking out about 600 of those pages. His insights are nil - what he says about the English is almost entirely cliche. The repetitiveness is unbelievable. How many times do we need to be told that Ryan doesn't like flying - or tea? And do we really believe that CIA and MI6 could be so clever and KGB so stupid as to allow the defection in the terms described. The whole stratagem is unconvincing and it is noticeable that when detail is required in order to convince the reader Clancy can never provide it. Incidentally, does Ryan, even though having been a marine, have to be so foul-mouthed? I dislike buying books and not finishing them but to finish this one was a real effort. No more Clancy for me."
4,Clancy's back with a vengeance!,"Red Rabbit rocks. I'd give it 5 stars but it did start on sort of slow so I gave it 4. Clancy gets into the mind of someone who would betray their country because his country is about to kill an innocent man for political gain and portrays it convincingly and interestingly and quite believable. The theme of resentment caused by the evils of communism or whatever idealogy is back which made earlier books more interesting. The way the CIA gets the Red Rabbit out is ingenious and cool. Not a lot of action but he get into the minds of the various characters, both good and bad."
1,Just Going Through the Paces,"Tom Clancy has apparently spent too much time reading his prior reviews and not enough time developing any new novel over the past several years. This book is anytghing but a page turner. Slow, plodding with minimal excitment.Very little in the way of plot development. No excitment, no surprises. After first hundred pages entire oucome predictable.I actually blame his editors and publishers for allowing such a piece of junk to be published."
2,Too much of a rant,"Red Rabbit differs considerably from Tom Clancy's other books in that it is moreso a political rant on how wonderful the blessed-by-god USA is and how crap and godless every other nation is.Key negatives are:- continuous ranting on how bad the UK health system is when Cathy Ryan starts working- commentary that evil is a direct result of not believing in god- everything the USSR manufactured was well below US standards (let's ignore Sputnik shall we!)I've been a big fan of Tom's previous books, so to see him lose the plot on what was a nice little underlying story was disappointing."
1,"Have you filled your contract quota yet, Clancy?","The title says it all, Clancy is definitely writing books to fullfill a contract quota because he has definitely lost all passion for writing evident by the garbage he has been churning out for about the last three novels; Red Rabbit is the absolute worst yet!!I have read all of his novels and 'was' a passionate fan. I almost cried when I finished Clear and Present Danger because I didn't want it to end. Now I cry every time I open a Clancy novel because each page is worse than the last and the end never comes soon enough.I'll read the next Clancy novel because, like a good addict, I'll keep looking for that rush I found in novels like The Cardinal but I fear I will never again find it (and like most others here, I'll only buy it from the bargain bin)."
2,Sadly disappointed in this effort...,"I've read all the Clancy books like the majority of his fans. I'm sad to reveal that this was my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent novel; but based on the great work he did in Executive Orders, Debt of Honor, Rainbox Six and the like, this was a let down."
2,The Worst Clancy Book,"I think I have now read all Mr C's Ryan/Clark series......and this is the worst, very dissapointing. I read somewhere that T.C. does his own editing, if this is correct it shows in Red Rabbit, way too long for the story.Mr Clancy has gone overboard with the detail in this story and seems to be using the book as a vehicle to impress his readers with his intimate detailed knowledge of his subject matter. The detail supplied in works such as Red October, Executive Orders and Debt of Honour was relevant and added to the experience making those books very good indeed, and EO & DOH were HUGE stories. The Red Rabbit story could have been told in 2/3 of the size, I only just managed to make it to the end. Also his knowledge of England could use a little work, It may pass muster to an Americam audience but is exposed to a british one.2 stars - must try harder"
2,Another disappointment from Clancy,"Tom Clancy seems to be one of several popular novelists whose recent books have disappointed readers due to the absence of a good story. (Robert Jordan, Diana Gabaldon, and Jean Auel come to mind). Why is this happening? Are publishers pushing authors to publish a big book every year? Is it greed on the part of the writers?Although we know the outcome of the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul, this could have been an exciting story, filling in some of the gaps in the life of Clancy's popular hero, Jack Ryan, and other recurring characters.But, as many reviewers have pointed out, there is no story, no action, no suspense, and far too much repetition. This is not the sort of writing that made Clancy famous.If you must read ""Red Rabbit,"" borrow it from the library."
2,The Worst Ending,"After trying hard to get the many characters names straight, Clancy mixes last names with first names and you don't know who is who. Halfway through the book you begin to understand a little better. The last paragraph of the book....where did that come from...The last page...no words to describe. Very disappointing!"
4,Our Hearts were Young and Gay,The stories I read were excellently written about events little known today but show that people are people through the ages. Delightful and insightful.
1,Get the Buckley cd,"OK, OK to the Americans the fact that Glenn Close took the lead in Sunset maybe makes this CD worthwhile, but better to get yourself the CD with 5 Betty Buckley tracks. No-one, but no-one can sing Norma Desmond like Buckley. Of course, Glenn Close can't sing anyway, so if it's the complete musical you're after, get the London album."
1,Forget the musical - Rent the movie,"Of all the hit movies turned into stage musicals, this is one of the worst. You never get to care about Norma or Joe or understand the dynamics of their relationship and I agree with many of the other reviewers on how BORING the music is. BORING and BLAND! The movie is a masterpiece. Why did Lloyd-Webber have to go and wreck it. Thank God the show closed quickly in both New York and London. A deserved flop!"
5,Back on their game!,"Madness is back on the top of their game! This is a great song. It is classic Madness! They sound more like they did in the early 80's than they ever have. So Wonderful wasn't so wonderful, but these new singles following up Dangermen are showing that these masters of their craft are getting better with age."
4,exceptional mozart specimen,I was pretty well enchanted by this whole recording. The phrasing of the flute is quite lovely and Mozart would have approved I'm sure. I feel that she was set up with some fellow chamber musicians who could nicely accompany her in all the variations. ---NORDIC LIGHT---
3,Angel Child,It was a very complex story that moved rather quickly. It shows how people can contine to be victimized even when the childhood is over.
5,a masterpiece,"I will admit to loving the work of Jules Shear. He writes the most skillful pop songs filled with intelligent and sometimes heart breaking lyrics. His lyrics have always reminded me of Truman Capote's prose... succient, crip, pointful, then wham! and barrage of emotional observances that cut you to the quick.Healing Bones is a masterpiece, it contains jewels that shine...some shine sadly. It is a testament to an artist at the top of his craft. It is a work of melody and words working in unison in the pop genre. Buy this cd...today."
4,Spyware Upgrade,"Many people have previously owned Spysubtract from Intermute. Although it was one of the best anti-spyware softwares ever made, many of those owners are set to have a complete overlook to a new version of the spyware software. For those who did own Spysubtract before, you'd have to upgrade to Trend Micro Anti-Spyware 3.0. This software runs exactly like what Spysubtract did, and it delivers much better at detecting spyware, adware and a much more detailed glimpse at the cookies that target and sneak into your life and computer. This is one anti-spyware software I really recommend, it is worth the price.Price: B+Convience: BPerformance: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
4,Georgette Heyer,I found this book a good read about one of my favorite authors. It told about Miss Heyer's research and writing habits in a clear and concise manner along with her private life and how it fit together. I would recommend this book to any one who wants to know about Georgette Heyer.
3,Not for core classical souls,"I bought this for Asha Bhosle. Her thumri renditions were disappointing in Shyam Benegal's Sardari Begum, I was hoping for a positive change. While I still cherish this compilation, in terms of its classical value it does not go much far."
1,Don't buy this!!!,"Ok, I am on my 3rd exchange. I have had 2 failed units. They both failed on the video side of the unit, but the audio continued to work. The latest exchange has audio problems, and a dead pixel, and I've only had it one day. Don't buy this, or if you do, don't say I didn't warn you. I wouldn't buy any audiovox product. They don't care that the unit is sub standard. I e-mailed them about the units, and their reply was as follows: ""Sorry you're having problems with this model"" unquote. End of story, no help or offer to help. I would never recommend this to anyone. Buyer Beware!"
2,Disappointing Unit,"First I'll say that I have no one to blame but myself for having bought this unit - I purchased it sight unseen on eBay. I can't say that it does not do what it is supposed to - and it has survived several long car trips without problems. The DVD player has worked fine throughout. However, it does have one major fault: the display is simply not bright enough. It's OK in the house (provided you dim the lights). However, in the car the display is almost unusable. Even in the back seat of a minivan with dark-tinted windows I had to block off the sides with cardboard to make the display watchable.So the bottom line is that the unit doesn't quite fulfill it's promise. I would not recommend it to anyone. I would recommend that anyone looking for such a unit buy from a local store where they can return the device if not satisfied. My only compensation is that I paid considerably less than the average price for the unit I have."
5,Fuel pump,I was a little nervous about buying it online because you cant just return it. But it was the perfect replacement part. The price was great and it was a exact match to the original part.
5,Awesome little machine,"I bought this to clean our new, very dark, hardwoods. It works great (although can't let it near the rug because it couldn't power on to it and got caught on the corner. It will save me tons of time each week keeping up with the dust."
5,Receiver of Roomba 4230 estatic,The Roomba 4230 was a gift form us and the receiver was thrilled with the technical capability as well as performance. It worked and was a joy to watch.
4,Roomba Scheduler,"I like this product. It works good, as advertised, but needs a little keeping after, like most vacuums. You need to keep the bin and brushes clean, and look for it once in a while because it'll get lost, but it cleans really well."
4,When to go against the crowd,"Shania's future husband produced this album.Since he was a rock 'n roll producer mainly this angered the country establishment some but it was a good move on Shania's part. Her popularity in country music largely stems from this CD.Fans, like myself, who loved this CD went back and bought the first CD.Ultimately, the fans loved this CD and Shania and didn't care what the country music bigwigs in Nashville, thought of Shania."
5,THE MUSIC ON SHANIA'S CD REALLY TOCHED ME.,"THE WOMAN IN ME IS AN EXCELLENT RECORD. THE WORDS TO MOST OF HER SONGS ON THAT ALBUM I CAN REALLY RELATE TO. ESPECIALLY THE SONG ""THE WOMAN IN ME."" SHANIA IS AN EXCELLENT SONGWRITER AND SINGER, AND SHE SHOULD KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
5,Enjoyable from start to finish,"Very few CD's come around that are jammed packed with hits. ""The Woman In Me"" is one of them. Every song on here is listenable, even the ones that never made radio are just as good as the hits. I can listen to this CD straight through. The ballads are great, the dance tracks are great. I don't know what she does but it works and it works well. I don't have ""Come On Over"" but I believe other reviewers when they say that this one is better because it would take a lot to match this album. I truly recommend this CD to everyone. This is not your typical country CD, it's very mainstream and accessible musically. I love it!"
5,A real keeper!!!,"What can I say. I'm long gone and lost.... kind of in love. Shania convinced me being a countryaddict. I love this CD with its great sound and musical quality. Hurray for great harmonyvocals, great songs, and wonderful choruses. This CD made a difference to me. I'm still hypnotized....Wow...I say no more. Go and get it!! But you should forget about buyin'""Come on Over"" That one will only disapoint you after you have listened to ""The Woman In Me"" as it is ""a once in a lifetime CD""!"
4,Pretty good overall (4.5),"While this CD has a lot of highlights, and is fun to listen to, there is nothing lasting here. The best song on here is the sassy I'm Outta Here, which will probably be stuck in your head for awhile. Shania definately did a lot on this album, as she co-wrote 11 tracks on this album. It definately brought country pop into mainstream, and probably influenced artists like Dixie Chicks and Faith Hill to make more pop friendly albums. I really like her voice. It isn't amazing, but it sounds good on every track on here. So in conclusion, this is a pretty good album. Her third CD, Come On Over, is better though, but this definately reached milestones for her."
5,Country music with an attitude!!!,"Shania Twain has done something with country music that very few have managed to accomplish. She has turned non and some-timey country listeners into full fledged country die hards. Her music has a sound that won't give up and keeps you listening for more. The beat gets you moving and the lyrics get you singing no matter what wood you're in, this music will get you jumpin and begging for more!!!"
1,disappointing and dull,I was looking forward to reading this author for the first time but this book couldn't catch my interest at all. I gave up after the fifth chapter. The premise of the story is unbelievable and the characters are unreal as well. Don't waste your time on this one.
5,Good CD,The selection of music really takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Then the final selection brings you back to reality softly.
2,Like trying to listen through...,"...However the one I have is on BigTime, printed in West Germany. Made in Holland, and has 20 tracks on it. I must've bought it over 10 years ago because it was the first Troggs CD I had ever seen. It says AAD, and I suspect the analog is because they recorded all of them, or nearly all, from old vinyl and scratchy 45's. I like all the songs but the sound quality is so bad that (although it is the Troggs garage/primitive sound) it is so bad that I hardly ever listen to it because it gives me a headache. Buy the newer box-set instead."
4,"Sing It, Sing It, Sing it!","Little known in 1972, ABBA released five singles before reaching International stardom. It all culminated in 1982 with more records sales then the Beatles. This 4-CD, 66 song Box Set is only for the true ABBA collector. Benny and Bjorn seem superhuman with their innate ability to write songs and perform a variety of instruments beautifully. Agnetha and Frida pull their own with vocal mixes and solos that defy most singers abilities. Al the songs are here and then some. Only the last disc seems a tad frivilous with a variety of mixes and little know versions of previously released songs. But who can blame them? It all seems like yesterday."
2,photoshop elements 4,this book is not at all conversent for Mac In talking with the editors they are not going to have an edition that is Feel that more explanation should be given as why to make changes in the color correction areas would not recommend for the novice Mac user 2 stars for the Mac user
3,Photographs by Annie Leibovitz Book,"Book is a long-desired gift that I was happy to have finally found for a very reasonable price. Areas in back of book are worn, but pages & cover in excellent condition."
5,Carol's Picks,I absolutely loved this book. The many famous photo's are a joy to look over and share with quest.
1,Strictly Middlebrow Material,"The NPR plug belied this trite piece of feminist fluff. The premise is cute, but the book writes itself. The authors' tales are commonplace, and the insipidity of their stories is passed off as poignancy. This book is destined for the 5 cent pile in many a garage sale."
5,Amazon rules!,Same as the original and works like a charm. Could not find this anywhere else (because it is so old). I am an Amazon fan!
1,not quite waht I expected,"I got what seems to be a Braun Oral B handle, but it does not have the timer feature or the charging indicator (see your own illustration - the little dot near the base is the indicator led in question). It works and charges (sort of), but seems to lack a little power. It did not come in a closed or sealed box, just a clam shell plastic cover that was held together with a single staple. I am not going to buy an entirely new setup when all I need is a motorized handle. If this one craps out I will consider another brand or go back to a series of manual brushes again. In fact I may do that anyway when my supply of brush heads runs out. I am not a particularly happy camper. In fact I just checked the unit to see if it is actually the item advertised, and it does not have a model number and is only marked with Ni-Mh. The original, at $19.95, with heads and charger stand, had a Lithium battery. The replacement for the kit I originally purchased, is $79. NOT!!!"
5,Great item,"Great replacement for my 6 year old toothbrush. Works great and price was great. It came in promptly, great feature of Amazon"
2,Picture format and video quality,"While I agree with the other reviewers as far as the performance is concerned, I must say that this dvd has some serious video issues.Picture in itself is non exactly reference quality, but it would be acceptable IF... if only the advertised ""widescreen"" format was a *real* widescreen.Instead, what we get is a widescreen film placed in a 4:3 frame, so that the black bars on the top and bottom are encoded into the picture. You'll probably feel the need to zoom, if you want he image to fit your 21st century 16:9 screen, except that by doing that you'll experience some serious resolution loss (and, as i said, resolution - and generally the picture - was far from exceptional in the first place...).I will NEVER understand why, in the year 2005, somebody would feel the need to produce something so ugly."
2,Jeeez Louise! Get to the point already!,"I don't usually skim through books, but by chapter two I'd had it with all the extraenous historical information that Dufty seems to think is needed. All I wanted to know was: why sugar is bad for you, what it does to your body physically and mentally, and what you can do to eliminate this drug from your diet, i.e. food substitutions. There is a little info on all the above, but you have to search through all the other verbage to find it. If you are the kind of person that likes to go to flea markets and sort through piles of junk in hopes of finding some little treasure, then you'll probably like this book. Me personally, I don't want to spend the time. Lets get right to the point. I came away wondering whether the publisher paid this guy by the word to write this book. Too verbose!!!I've since ordered another book by Gittleman? called 501 ways to eliminate sugar from your diet, which from the reviews I've read, sounds like its more to the point."
4,A diamond in the rough:Poorly written-Vital information,"This book shows that numerous ills of refined sugar(sucrose). It is an extremely important book because it represents the first step in a realization that sucrose is much worse for you than the billion-dollar sugar industry wants you to believe. There are very important statistics and valid points hidden among a text which is not very cohesive. It is rather like stream of consciousness in its style and almost paranoid in its feel, but it remains an important read for beginning to unravel the sugar myth."
5,great book,"The thing I found most fascinating about reading this book was the historical background it gave me on the subject of sugar in general. Reading more like a crime drama than a health manual, I was surprised to recognize over and over again the parallel's between sugar's sordid history and other ""big lie"" cultural scourges.And yes, today I'm 59 days clean."
2,Fullscreen only!,"Unfortunately, this DVD release will be full-screen only. What kind of DVD gets released in full-screen these days (and a sci-fi film at that!)?Otherwise, it is a great film, full of suspense and a great precursor to the Terminator series of films."
3,Typical Cold War Paranoia,"I was a bit disappointed by the lack of imagination shown by this movie. Even given that it was witten and produced long before the rise of famous talking computers (2001 A Space Odysey, War Games, etc) Issac Asimov showed much more inspiration in his books of the same period.As is usual for this type of movie, it is more a chess match between the good guys and the bad guys (or in this case the Bad Bot) than a football scrimmage. Fast paced action it is not. But the story line is just too limp to hold up even as a straight drama."
2,"five stars for the movie, 0 starts for the full screen",Studios who issue only full screen dvds of originally wide screen releases ought to have all their dvds suffer from rot. Let the very few idiots who want a full screen release watch the movie when it is butchered for tv or issue two versions of the DVD. DVD's that people purchase should be released in the original aspect ratio or not at all.
4,"Excellent, once it gets going","A supercomputer that takes over the world, eh? Sounds like a rather unbelievable plot, except that in this movie they make it believable. That is, if you can believe they'd make the computer in the first place that controls all the nuclear bombs in the U.S., which I had a very hard time believing as most people who make war machines would install some kind of manual safety.This movie starts out optimistic which makes it a bit dull at the start, but about halfway through it becomes very intense. The ending is very chilling, and makes me wish there was another couple hours.I give it 4 stars because it is a bit slow and predictable at the start, but it builds and builds until the end scares the pants right of you."
1,colossaly TINY!!!!,"By QUANMECH; I totally agree with all those who are really ticked-off that this DVD (and,for that matter, VHS) is presented in so-called full-frame (I say ""so-called"" because there's nothing FULL about it). WHAT A WASTE! Maybe if enough of us vote with our feet, i.e., NO SALE, maybe someone in charge will WISE-UP and get this COLOSSAL movie re-issued in the format it not only deserves but DEMANDS! Wide-Screen or nothing!"
4,Infinite times his own Intellect,"Extremely interesting, and entertaining. A radical look at how a man made machine took on a life of it's own.MarkAnthony"
4,A Good Second Chance,Usually when it comes to Danielle Steel. She hits and misses. One good novel one bad novel. This novel is all hits. While people argue that the plot was unrealistic when it comes the daughter's attitude. I would have to disagree no child no matter how old. Wants to see their parent replace with another woman or man. Especially if the parents dies. But aside for that the novel displays what happens two people who are crazy about each other tries to combine a life together without a little give and take. I love this book.
2,Unrealistic,"Danielle spins the usual McRomance. Fairly decent for her, but sometimes there are situations in her books that are simply 50 years out of date. Example is the lady in a former book whose husband REFUSED to let her attend law school. Hello? 2004 calling? I remember a story about a character giving birth who was forced to give birth with her legs strapped down. This written in like 1985 and they stopped doing that in like 1965. Well, the throwback in this book is the two selfish girls who were ""cruel"" to the stepmother. Hello? 2004 calling? Like 60% of their contemporaries don't have mixed families? Like mom DIED two years ago? Like y'all are adults? The twist that irritates so much that it throws you out of the web of belief needed to enjoy a romance novel."
1,"Repetitive and ""dumbed down""","Danielle Steel's made for tv movies have always enthralled me - I thought her books would do the same. Nope - this is the second one I've read that left me wondering what age group she was targeting. She repeats herself like crazy, and the book is filled with short, choppy sentences. In addition, the characters made me bristle! Fiona seems the opposite of the fashion magnate in The Devil Wears Prada - she is kind, generous, and seems to have a heart. She swears off marriage, then lo and behold - after 40+ years of loving singlehood she meets and marries a man in an 8 month time span. This guy swears to never leave her, and knows who he is marrying, yet two months later he throws in the towel - after letting his adult kids and the housekeeper walk all over him. This book is just all around bad -"
3,An average Tintin,"A solid Tintin story. Not as good as some and not the worst either. My kids enjoyed the ""slapstick"" comedy of the picaros."
3,Serves the purpose,"Um, the shirt comes with sleeves, which i cut off, because John Lennon's shirt doesn't... so unless some one just wants a ""New York City"" shirt, they're gonna have to cut the sleeves off.Enjoy."
1,Great Time Books,Ordered Shrink Rap by Robert Parker Jr. from Greattime Books in early December. They confirmed they received the order and sent me an e-mail that it shipped 28 December. Have not received the book. Have sent them two e-mails requesting status and they haven't answered either. They did bill my credit card. Would recommend not buying anything from this vendor.
3,Okay if you don't demand a lot of believable detail,"If you like Parker, you'll like this book because it is another example of what he does best. Short chapters, stereotyped characters and familiar angst in familiar surroundings. If you are not a Parker fan, it may be difficult to swallow that the heroine can just put on a wig and successfully present herself repeatedly in close quarters to a psychiatrist (whom she has already met several times) as a comletely different person. If you are willing to overlook that particular plot lynchpin, then you're likely to enjoy the book."
1,"PASS THE NO-DOZE, PLEASE",TEDIOUS--REPETITIVE--TEDIOUS--REPETITIVE---TEDIOUS--REPETITIVE--TEDIOUS--REPETITIVE---YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS??PARKERS ONE OF MY FAVORITES--THIS IS NOT ONE OF HIS BEST.
4,Very Nicely Done,"I chose this CD for my advanced beginner class and am overall satisfied..The music selections are upbeat, classic and nicely performed. The only drawback is that the barre selections are only run once through so you have to repeat the music for the left side."
4,Good Overall,"While this particular CD doesn't contain any of my actual favorites by Cinderella, I beleive that it very well may be the single best Cinderella release overall. For a slower, Ballad type song, I think hard to find the words is my personal favorite."
1,Nothing here,"The more I search, the less I find in this lousy album by this glam-metal band. Only the same old cliches."
1,Hated it,"Such an inaccurate portrait. I got it to show to my Romantic Lit class, but decided not to show it after I watched it. Very disappointing"
1,Way too small,"I bought this for a castle we already own thinking it would be 10"" or so in height. It was 2-3"" tops! Likely my fault for not reading but I wanted to warn others as to how small this is. The knights from our castle are bigger than the dragon."
5,Every Castle Needs a Dragon,"Bought this dragon to go with the Melissa and Doug Castle. He is a little big for it, but he still gets played with a lot. I wish he would fit in the dungeon, but he is just a bit too big. He just gets to terrorize all the princesses until the princes scare him away."
3,"Good movie for its time, and filmed on location","This movie started a little slow, but I was impressed with the quality. This movie was different from other Ripper movies that he seemed to strangle the victims and there was only a vague hint that he did anything else, but it is from 1959 so things are alot more restrained then, but the voice of the ripper was enough to make your skin crawl. There are plenty of red herrings and suspects in this movie to keep you guessing who it is, and the town thugs that want to take the law into their own hands keep appearing and make life nasty, but in the end what happens to the bad guy is even nastier than I expected.I am glad I bought the movie I am a big Jack the Ripper fan, and I am a sucker for the old black and white movies so I would say rent it, buy it give it a go.Jack The Ripper"
5,COME BACK LADAE!!,"I can remember the first time I heard LADAE. It was on the Video Jukebox channel. I couldn't stop requesting the video ""Deep Down"". They tried to make a comeback with Al B. Sure!, but so much for that. I hear them as a cross between New Edition and Boys II Men. Whatever they are ... were ... I wish they would come back. Buy this CD. You will not be disappointed."
1,Misleading product title/discription,"Look closely at your order if you buy this. The title and description clearly said it was a 6-pack when I added it to my cart. When I went to check out, the item in my cart said it was only one pair. I tried deleting the item and adding it again from the product page, which still said 6-pack, and again the item added to my cart, at the same price, was only one pair."
3,Super Blue Stuff,"The super Blue stuff We received is a good product.It is not as good as the Super Blue Stuff with Emu Oil we buy at Walmart.The Emu oil works better to releive arthritis pain.If you sell the Super Blue Stuff wit0 Emu oil, Please let me know.PF"
2,Very weak sound,I bought this as a gift for my wife because I have come to expect decent quality from Sony. I ended up being very disappointed by its performance. The maximum volume on this is weak even by clock radio standards. Don't waste your money on this item.
4,A good Grounding,"As a catholic, I found this book a refresher on religion and many of the questions we ask of our faith. Even a non-catholic would find this enlightening...if you have the strength to ask the questions."
5,This is not the ESV text Catechism.,"We were looking for the ESB text Catechism and when we looked at the ""Look Inside"" we saw that the ESV was used for other parts. The ISBN on the look inside was different from the NIV text version. Even a banner on the top of the page advertizes ""Luther's Small Catechism with Explanation (ESV)"" Kindle edition.When we got the book, it said NIV version on the outside. Not the image on the Amazon page, but on the book we received.The ISBN listed under product details is for the NIV version. My bad. Next time I pay more attention to the product details.It is like the other version we have have on sight so we will still be able to use it and if we cannot find an ESV text version, we will use these instead."
2,Too squishy,"I bought this at a medical supply place for $30 and cannot return it. It isn't very supportive at all and compresses to barely 2""."
2,Goes flat,"The idea is great...the design is almost there. The thing with this is, it goes flat really fast. After it is flat, then it's just a thin pad between you and the chair. Nice idea, but nothing an old towel can't do for you."
2,Expectation not met,My expectation for the Mckenzie Lumbar Roll was that its firmness would last for longer.. Not 2 months old yet and it is beginning to feel soft.
2,"Very ""squishy"" and quick to lose firmness","I've had this about two weeks and am disappointed in it. The strap doesn't fasten well around a standard office chair and easily loosens. The roll says it's a ""standard firmness."" That's a meaningless description and makes it hard to make a sensible purchase. I'd say that this roll is not even as firm as what you would have by rolling up a normal terrycloth towel into a roll form. Worse, after only a few days, the roll became deformed just by virtue of having used it. I'm going to now spend the $ for the ""firmer"" roll but am not terribly optimistic given the quality of this product."
3,lumbar support for your carseat.,"This product took some getting used to. I use it in my car. I find that it works but it seems to lose it's firmness so, I have to reach behind my back while I'm driving and rotate it. It's an okay product. I feel better after using it on a long drive."
4,Cool look but,"The case for this thumb drive is very cool BUT super flimsy, and the UT logo and colors are the only reason I chose this model. I'm afraid I'll break it every time I use it. BUT it works just fine and delivery was fast."
1,Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy,"This is a disappointing, boring, incoherent mess. About five minutes into the movie, it is impossible to keep track of what is going on or why. In the last 10 minutes of the movie, it becomes understandable again but by that time who cares? The characters are uninvolving and the special effects pointless. With a plot that starts out with the destruction of the earth, and the sole two survivors traveling the galaxy with peculier aliens, this movie should be riveting. Unfortunately, there is no attempt to make the characters more than one dimentional, and the dialogue could have been written on a cocktail napkin. There's not much of it, and what there is contributes nothing to either plot or characters. Don't waste your time unless you want background noise while you're cleaning the house or something."
4,Improbability Generator For Sale,"I was first exposed to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy through the famous computer text adventure game, so I had high expectactions for the movie.The Hitchhiker's Guide was written so far ahead of it's time, that technology just now exists to bring the characters in the book to life. I think the movie was so clever that it will be enjoyable even if you have never read the book or played the game.If you are a hardcore fan, then you will spend many hours singing the theme song with all of your friends! The DVD has an extra Sing Along feature that has all of the words, along with the beautiful opening scenes of the movie.So Long! (And thanks for all the fish!!!)"
3,Not a bad adaptation...,"I read The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy when I was about 10 or 11 years old and loved it. Some kids wouldn't have ""gotten it"" , but I liked Monty Python and so I could appreciate that style of humor.Now, I wouldn't recommend that someone see this movie without having read the book first, but that's because without at least a generalized foreknowledge of the characters and um...storyline.It's a good movie to watch with your kids. I'd give it a 3.5, but that option is not available."
3,Deserves a round of dolphin applause,"3.5 stars. I saw this movie without having read the books they are based on, so I had no expectations to be dashed or fulfilled. It begins with British everyman Arthur Dent finding out his best friend, Ford Prefect, is not a struggling actor, but an alien working for an galactic travel guide. Ford saves Arthur as the Earth is about to be blown up to make way for an Intergalactic expressway. From here the movie jumps from one alien world to another with the Guide explaining things along the way.There is a lot going on in the movie because of the different aliens and their worlds but its not difficult to follow. Some people have complained about the effects. While it's not Star Wars or some other effects behemoth, they are still very well done. I thought the movie was pretty funny. It's dry and very British, so know that going into it. I also think the movie challenges your imagination."
2,90s Flashback - (2.5 stars),"Do you remember the movies that the major networks use to show on Saturdays and Sundays before we all had satellites and cable? The bizarre, incoherrent non-hits that were used to fill a dead time slot? This is what this movie reminds me of! It is nonsensical and only loosely held together with an insubstantial plot, and yet, I watched it, and nearly liked it. I say nearly because I can't really tell you any one part that really grabbed my attention, nor remember any characters names. The movie, as a whole, sparked my interest to read the book with hopes that it is a little better. As far as the movie goes, I rented it free from the library so I don't feel juped for wasting money on this. I wouldn't recomend buying this, I can hardly see watching this over and over again. Kids might find this movie entertaining . . . for a while."
3,Life... Dont talk to me about life,"Ok, so I watched the old BBC addition and rather liked it. When I heard there was to be a remake I instantly had the bad feeling that it would, as Marvin so rightly put it, ""End in tears"" of the wasited time watching, If it weren't for Alan Rickman as Marivn in the movie I would have gladly forgone watching it."
1,The original TV series is MUCH better than the movie.,"I read all the novels and I have the original TV version of the Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy, so I went to the movie with an open mind and at first, I enjoyed it. However, I realized that the movie is a pale imitation of both the books and the TV series. The special effects, especially the Vogon fleet, look like the SFX people were lazy and they didn't care how the effects came out, the Vogons were unconvincing (and they would have been done better with live actors), Deep Throat and Magrathea seemed to be tacked on to the plot as an afterthought and we didn't have to see the Vogon homeworld. Give us missiles turned into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias instead of John Malkovich anyday. The only good thing was the voice of Marvin. Alan Rickman did it so well that I have no doubt that he could make anyone depressed in five minutes or less. I'd rather watch the TV series than the movie any day."
3,It was nice to look at,It was nice to look at but I really have no idea what this movie is about. It seems to have a lot of different ideas all thrown together and the characters have no idea which direction to go. But the visuals were great. I loved seeing the rebuilding of earth and the comedy was at times very funny. I loved the depressed robot guy. He should star in his own movie.
3,Disappointing Average Film,"I really had high hopes for this film, but it kind of let me down in the end. The best part of the film was the Davis/Rickman robot Marvin that is always depressed. It's what kept me watching the entire time because the character is funny. But at somepoints of the film, I was just bored. The only thing that kept it from being completely bad was the funny jokes through in right before I got bored with the film. Yeah, it has some funny parts every now and then, but nothing special. The film really drags and is too long for such a so-so film. A rental, probably not worth buying unless you are a huge fanatic of the book"
1,PAINFUL TO WATCH,"I sat through this horible movie and I am still not sure how I did it. The acting was terrible, and the story was even worse. I mean, WHAT STORY? There wasn't any but a bunch of fweird fluff to fill up 120 minutes. The characters were unsympathtic and I couldn't care less about any of them. The President was plain annoying and the so called love relationship didn't work at ALL!! Don't waste your money, but better, don't waste your time either. Too many other good movies and classics to watch before this nonsense."
5,"Loved the book, loved it in theatre, love having it on my PSP.","If you're a fan of the Hitchhiker books, you have to see the movie. I saw it in the theatre and enjoyed it enough to want to own a copy. It's humorous, entertaining, AND it gives you stuff to think about without a stomachache. I love the portability of having it on PSP so that I can just pop it in any time, whether on the road or at home and ease my world-weary troubled mind with a little sci-fi."
1,Waste of time,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Really. I can't even say it's the 2nd worst because I can't think of any movie that was worse. I was already familiar with the book (which I did not enjoy), so I went into the movie expecting it to be dumb. I guess my expectations weren't low enough. It wasn't just dumb, it was horrible. The plot was weak. The acting was poor. The graphics were bad. I saw it at the dollar theater and that was too much to have to pay. In fact, I ended up walking out of the movie--the first time I have ever done that."
1,Burn the master!,"This production is the worst thing to happen to film since ""Pluto Nash"" and ""The Making of the Dukes of Hazard""... ok, it's third worst... ok, it's not that bad. Look, put it this way - see the original BBC miniseries production and your head will explode if you watch this remake. I love HHGTTG so much that I hate this one even more b/c it is such a disappointment. 1* (since -5* is not possible)"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I bought this movie because I saw the previews on another movie I bought. Well, the previews were funnier than the entire movie! This movie stinks! So to all you out there (including SCI-FI Fans), save your money and buy something else, anything else but this movie!"
1,Not worth the 1 star I gave it,"I was horrified at how the movie completely ignored both the story followed in the books and the characters in the books. The only similarity between the characters in the book and on the screen are the names. However... not everyone read the books.If you haven't read the books (you really should do so) then this movie probably won't seem too apealing anyway. Should you get the idea in your head to watch it, I implore you not to do so. This movie is tremendously boring and only dables following a plot without much real commitment. None of the ideas that the movie tries to express are fully fleshed out, and the plot that the film tries to follow isn't very good anyway."
5,Awesome movie,"Cool movie. Based on the radio show and books by Douglas Adams in the 1970s. [...] Glad it's on Blu-Ray, well worth it. :)"
4,enjoyably goofy,"I like the book, I liked the movie, I liked listening to Stephen Fry, I like the song the dolphins sing in the movie ""So long and thanks for all the fish"".So Long & Thanks For All The FishThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
1,disappointed,I purposely did not reread the book so that I didn't enter the theatre with too high expectations. Regardless of any efforts I made - the movie was awful. They took a great concept littered with ideas and didn't do a darn thing with it. It was outrageously boring and highlighted very few of the the little tidbits that made people love the books. Such a shame.
1,You won't believe how bad this movie is,"Ok, this movie is bad, really bad. You just won't believe how mind-bogglingly bad it is.Take the original book. Put it through the blender. Take a few flakes and add in some unnecessary Disney-esque characters and a love triangle. Tie together things into a neat, stupid, cliche plot that doesn't relate to the original.How did this movie get made? Argggggh! All of the gravitas, the drama, the humour, the fun was drained out. The timing is horrible. The dialogue is butchered. This ""production"" doesn't live up to the word ""movie"": a movie needs characters, plot, setting, DRAMA, ENTERTAINMENT! All are missing.I'm surprised but the original, low-budget BBC TV series blows away this Hollywood crap. Go with the books and laugh. Enjoy the BBC radio series. Enjoy the TV series. Avoid this movie, this Hollywood black hole absence of entertainment."
3,Why did they make it a love story?!?!!,"I'm a bit of a DNA fanatic, and as such, I expected the movie to be different, since the books are different from the radio scripts which are different from the TV show which was different from the video game, etc. I was fine with the added/changed scenes (which DNA thought up himself).What really annoys me about the movie version is that they added the overriding ""falling in love"" story between Arthur and Trillian. While there was some very understated tension between the two in the books, that wasn't the story.I think they sacrificed quite a bit of cleverness to promote the love story plot."
1,Worst movie ever!,I cannot put into words the extent of how bad this movie was! It has been a long time since I saw it but I feel dumber for having wasted my time on this piece of flotsam and regret that I will never get this time back in my life. Avoid this movie and do something more fun like hit your thumb with a hammer. At least by doing that you will have had a more memorable experience.
1,Pathetic at every level,"I have never been more disappointed in a film I expected to enjoy. This boring, beyond childish, piece of wasted energy should be flushed immediately before infection occurs."
3,cute,"This was a cute version, and a very, very loose version of Adam's famed books. And I liked watching it. But...I am very biased, as I am a big fan not only of the books, but also of the BBC series that came out all those years ago.But this version, while containing many of the elements of the books, and several hidden references (who spotted the original Marvin robot in the line?), still failed to be true to the books message. The romance between Dent and Trillian seemed forced, and the added story about the political conflict was useless.Still, it was a joy to see Adam's work in such a mainstream media, and I certainly won't be giving up my copy."
1,Prose - not paper - should be clear,"I disliked this book for two reasons.First, it is difficult to read. The pages are semitransparent so that the ink from one side of the paper is visible from the obverse side. It looks like a palimpsest or a book soaked in the rain; reading it gives me a headache.Second, the book is too political. Its selections from modern literary analysis are subsumed by polemic focused on various flavors of identity politics and Marxism. A typical sentence: ""In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design."" (p. 2,281). Even if it seems unobjectionable for one sentence, and even if one agrees with the politics, the long, political analyses, over hundreds of pages, are out-of-place in a book on literary theory."
4,The Reader,"An intriguing tale of passion, witchcraft and historical events written in a compelling fashion. Obviously well researched."
5,miras from Portugal,"Interesting, relaxing, witty, enjoyed by all the family and friends. Taking us back to the full glory of the British Empire. Certainly would make a good present to anybody."
3,did the job,This book was outdated. I can't believe this is the text they wanted me to use for my class. The seller discription was accurate and the book was in good shape. No complaints
3,Is Donna Summer finally over disco?,"Donna Summer takes a few steps further away from disco - in the aftermath of disco's burial; Donna seems here to be making progress with her protracted farewell to disco - something she had done starting with 1980's ""The Wanderer"", followed by 1981's ""I'm A Rainbow"".""Love Is In Control"" is the most memorable disco hit of this album. It was even released at the time in a 7+ minutes single version. ""Mystery Of Love"" is also very enjoyable to disco fans, not to mention pop/r&b freaks as well. ""(If It) Hurts Just A Little"" is equally enjoyable. ""Protection"" isn't so good.""Livin' In America"" falls a lot behind this same song's version on the ""Rocky iv"" soundtrack."
2,It hurts just a little ...,"After the rejected ""I'm A Rainbow"" album, Donna Summer was paired with Quincy Jones to produce her next album. Very misguidingly it is entitled ""Donna Summer"" - it would be more appropiate to assume this was a Quincy Jones album, accidentally featuring Donna Summer. ""Love Is In Control"" was a good hit single but the rest of the tracks are an overproduced mess, and particularly the sickly ""Livin' In America"" is unlistenable with the happily chanting children choir embellishing how wonderful everything is in the states. Anyone could have sung these tracks, now it just happened to be Donna. Sad, really."
4,"good product, but first shipment is defective one","This product is made in Philippin, not made in Japan. The first shipment I have is defective one. After I sent the defect Filter back, I got the replaced Filter without any issue."
2,Not the correct lens for my camera,"I ordered this lens when I ordered my camera. The lens came up in the search for a cannon s5 and when I got it, turned out to be way too big for the lens."
3,"A great mistery, which hints at a supernatural murderer.","This book is set in a small town, and features a very unorthodox detective. The fact that there is a curse on the family, and the dark story of the place where the murders are comitted, make a perfect atmosphere for this mystery/horror book. Carr's best book is ""The Three Coffins"""
2,Kitchen towel set,Love the look of these towels but they aren't very absorbement. One of the towels is a different texture and we find they we reach for that one first. It was a great bargain though.
3,its okay,"At first this book is boring but then towards the end it gets pretty good. I liked it a lot. It tells the story of Inge and her life during the holocaust time. And how difficult it is to keep her friendship with her best friend Lisselote. Whose father is a Nazi. Close ones are leaving and going through hard times. THis is a wonderful and exciting story! It may seem boring at the beginning but believe me it gets better! I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books about the holocaust, WW 2 or anything similar to that."
4,A must read,"I am an avid fan of anything on World War II, so when I found this book it was like hitting the jackpot. This is the book that the movie ""Friendship in Vienna"" was based on. The movie is wonderful, the book even more so. It is about two girls, one Jewish, one Christian, in Vienna just as it is being taken over by Hitler. The Christian girl's father is a big part of the SS. Their friendship struggles to survive in the midst of a world that is being torn apart."
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this camisole to replace the thread bare ones that I've been clinging to for longer than I'd care to admit. When I received it, it looked exactly like my thread bare camis because it was so thin it was see through. To top it off, there's an elastic band around the bottom that causes it to ride up all day long. It's a waste of money. I'm better off wearing my old grungy shirts."
3,Good...For It's Purpose,"Although it did have a lot of useful information, it was nothing you couldn't find on the internet. It was written in ""textbook"" style, and didn't have much besides the facts."
5,Best Friend through school,This book literally saved me countless times in school through its quick easy to find information. I now always flip through it to make sure everything is correct. It even reminds me of things I haven't yet gotten to and therefore keeps me on track. Can't say enough about it.
2,Writing style detracts from what could be a good read,"I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and usually like the realisitic angle on women's lives as well as the more romanticized. And I usually finish any book I pick up. However, Holland's terse writing style (I think she is trying to put you into Maria's relatively practical, immediate mindset) really detracts from the flow of the book. Nearly every sentence is short and declarative, and it grated on me enough that I abandoned the book halfway through."
3,ok,I usually love Jaci Burton but this one just didn't do it for me. Yes it was very steamy but I never connected with the characters or the story.
3,Free Steamy Read,I received this book free so I can't complain too much. This book was filled with smokin' sex scenes and beautiful characters; Michael and Serena. So put two strangers at a resort and they have to share a room and you get Paradise Awakening. Although the storyline was unrealistic it was still steamy. A good escape book to read while in between novels. Wish this book was a longer to further develop the characters and story line.
1,would have made a nice article,"The idea behind this book is great, but its information could easily fit into a 3-page article in Woman's Day or a similar popular magazine. I expected to learn much more than I did from this very repetitive book. (It almost made me feel like I was aging on the spot: ""Hey, didn't I just read that a few pages ago? Am I forgetting or imagining things?"")"
3,"Stronger than expected, but...","Stronger than expected, but also a bit smaller than expected. There are sections that protrude into usable area of container. Also, why do these get to me so filthy? I had to hose them down before putting them inside."
5,Bangin Old School Hip-Hop,"This right here is true HIP-HOP. For all the real hip-hop fans this is a must have.Incredible beats from the beginning to the end, and also good party lyrics from M.C. Tee reminding everyone that hip-hop is supposed to be fun. Your collection will not be complete until this is in it. You will dance your a** off to this cd. Get it and listen to pioneering hip-hop at it's best."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a pre-service teacher and have been looking for books to guide me as I go through my teacher training. I found this book based on a quote by Schlatter I discovered on the internet. I was a little disappointed. While the stories are inspiring, I had hoped that they would be more teacher-oriented. In fact, they're not. Most of the stories are of day-to-day life. If you are looking for a ""chicken soup""-like book, get this one. If you want information on what it's like to be a teacher, buy something else."
1,PEEE----YOUUUUU,It smells awful in the bottle and even worse when you spray it on yourself. It is good though to keep around in case you are on a date with someone you want to get rid of. Just spray some on and they go away. It's like bug spray for people.
4,The modern hit-writing authority...,"...Davis catalogues the fundamentals of the craft, from lyric structure to rhyme and meter to avoiding common pitfalls. She makes all of this easy to understand. Every one who wants to write lyrics should buy this book.Singer-songwriters be warned: this book is written by a non-performing, professional lyricist. Those not trying to write a Top-40 hit should take Davis' comments about appropriate subject matter with a grain of salt. Davis' prose is what you'd expect from someone who writes catchy songs for a living: hokey and salesmanlike.None of this detracts from the basic truth of the book, that clarity and specificity are virtues in writing, while obtuseness and vagueness can never successfully pass for depth. For her examples Davis sticks to truly well-written songs; for the most part she does not hold certain genres superior to others. In sum, the woman knows of what she speaks. Read this book."
5,Simply excellent.,Having tried to cook from some of the more traditional French cookery books over the years this book is really refreshing. Some lovely recipes which are not hard to do and a logical progression of the recipes with an engaging chatty style.
3,At last I can finally read this book,I bought this book about 5 years ago and I am starting to read it now.I'm an architect and fascinated with 3d and renderings but totallyclueless about programming. At first I got the impression that I neededLinux to view VRML worlds I dont know if that was true. Scared ofloosing my information put aside the book. After a couple of yearsI remembered the book and never found the Tenochtitlan Site!Completely bizarre. Again I left it to dust for a couple of years.Now I have the time to read it and finally found the Tenochtitlan Site(not the original one by the way thank God someone else published it).[...]I am starting to understand the book although I think it's becauseI took a crash course on Basic Flash and I'm finally getting it.I can't say if VRML is obsolete but I think it can't hurt to learnthe tech where all began.Good luck on your buying decision.
4,Very Nice :),"I love these dishes, but honestly I bought them from Pfaltzgraff online for less. They are very nice looking - even better than the picture. The only problem is the mugs are not all that nice, I would call them ""seconds"" because the ones I received the clay lines didn't meet on the opposite side of the mug and they are all over the place on the rest of them. Meaning the front of the mug looks great but the other side that your guest would see is ugly. I called Pfaltzgraff and told her this is not what I had expected from Pfaltzgraff and she was nice to send new ones, but could not tell me if the ones coming would be like that or not as she couldn't connect to the warehouse. No I didn't laugh out loud I held it in. So we shall see what I get in the mail. These maybe better, but I would call whoever you buy these from first and ask about the quality of the mug. Other than that I love them :)"
4,Creative writing,This book is an organized aid for writers new and old... I am hopingto use this book as a text book for my writing.
1,Is a Pain!,"Just look for another product. But if you like to waste time,like make it run. This make it extremly bad."
4,Excellent Software once you get it to work!,"I'm 36 and never learned how to type. I figured I'd try and since the Mavis Beacon series seem to be the most popular, I got this one, despite some reviews describing installation problems.Sure enough, when I installed it, it wouldn't run. You basically need to set it up to run in Win98 or Win2000 compatibility mode, at 640x480 resolution. Reboot, and Voila!So it's been 3 days, and even though my speed dropped quite a bit with learning the proper fingers, I'm typing properly. And the speed is coming back fast.The classes are very well designed, it's actually pretty amazing how efficient it is, and fun on top of it.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the compatibility issues. How hard can it be for their engineers to update their engine?!"
1,Do not buy this program,"Mavis Beacon is terrible. This review will be short because I still don't know how to type. This is a very crude program with lots if glitches. It ""forgets to teach you entire lessons. You can't find these lessons and access them on your own. You can't go back in its History function and repeat areas you have trouble with. It quizes on keys it hasn't taught you. It is just as bad on Windows as Mac. There must be something better out there."
1,Buggy and annoying,"It's not so much that it crashes periodically, as that the user interface is ancient, and they haven't bothered to update it at all. This might have been a reasonably decent program once. It isn't now."
5,I am at a complete loss....,"....to reasonably describe this album. ""Underrated"", ""hidden gem"", ""must have"", are all accurate but woefully inadequate. This music will bring you to a complete stop and beguile you until you play it over and over. Do not miss out on this album!"
5,solid playing,this one should have been called super natural cuz it has so many quality sounding tracks.carlos has tone for days.it's a real gem.he blends so many styles well and crafty.
5,"I simply loved it, it kept me turning the pages.","This book is one of Marion's best, I was tempted to read it all in one night. This book has an ever-twisting plot that keeps you turning the pages. Margaret Alton is suddenly informed on a past she never new, and seemingly foolish ways of the Darkovans. Mikhail Hastur, her lover, is a lovely figure to read about. He is sent off to test young children for the Elhaylin throne, and finds something terribly wrong. In all I love this book, and would read it again anytime."
3,really really bugged,"You know what really really bugged me? Alan Parsons ventures into the world of electronics and guess what; NO CD-TEXT!!!Anyway, about the musical style, it was to be expected that opinions would differ. This kind of music exists for a long time already, but not in the mainstream market. Personally I found the post Woolfson cd's getting more and more predictable/ boring, so after listening to A Valid Path I have to admit it was 'refreshing'. Not completely my kind of music though but it does make nice background music when playing C&C; Generals.What I did enjoy to the fullest was the sound quality! Nice to know that in that area he is still improving. I can also dig those nice little effects with the voices :-)) Uhm, some lyrics were embarrasingly bad/ cliche...I hope it won't take that many years for a follow-up and that I'll be more pleasantly surprised."
4,Well worth the trip.,"""Return to Tunguska"" is worth the price of admission all by itself if you're a fan of AP instrumentals. While the overall compilation admittedly isn't quite as good as the cohesive ""Time Machine"", it's quite a bit better than the tedious ""On Air"" or the scattered ""Try Anything Once."" I personally like having a couple of redone classics, although I'd have preferred to have them as ""bonus"" tracks rather than taking 2 of a precious 9."
2,Dissapointed,"I expected better from Parsons after 5 years. A few are pretty good, but overall, not as good as any of his others. The best one is his own remake of ""The Raven""."
1,Forget The Project,"I have always been a big fan of Alan Parsons' music and when it was brought to my attention that a new record was coming out I was thrilled! Well, I purchased ""A Vaild Path"" and needless to say I am quite dissappointed. Alans' previous effort ""THe Time Machine"" is such an enjoyable record that the release of his new project would lead fans to believe that ""A Valid Path"" would pickup where ""The Time Macine"" left off. WRONG. Gone are mainstays Ian Bairnson and Stuart Elloitt. They are sorely missed throughout the record. All I would like to include is if you've been a fan of the work of Alan Parsons' throughout the ""Project"" days and his solo work, this CD is not for you."
1,THE WORST PROJECT,"I'm a APP fan, I love The Turn of.., Eye in the Sky, On Air, Vulture, Gaudi, etc, but this work is horrendous. After the departure of Woolfson and Bairnson, Alan stayed alone and produced the worst project of all times. There's none that catched me. It seems a techno project, with two old songs.Sorry, but it must be the end of the project. Go to Porcupine Tree and Marillion."
2,Not for traditional Parsons fans,"I was surprised to see so much positive feedback for this. And, while I wish Alan the best and appreciate all of the past magic, this was definately a non-valid path for me.I should have listened to clips before buying. But, the cover was cool and cryptic as ever; and, heck it was Alan Parsons.I've loved every Alan Parsons piece. My favorites being ""Tales of Imagination,"" ""Gaudi,"" ""Eve,"" and the next most recent ones ""On Air"" and ""Time Machine."" If you are expecting music on ""Valid Path"" to be in the vein of those....don't.It has great fidelity (as always), but the music/songs are lost at sea to me.With humble apologies to Alan."
4,U-boat basics,"If you are looking for a good overview of WWII and the impact of the u-boat, this is the video for you. not too in-depth, but with some different footage, this is an informative video."
1,"Watched once, threw it in the trash.","I've never done a review on Amazon before but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to. I bought this DVD for my son, as he is into Iron Man in a crazy way. First of all, this movie is deadly dull. Incredibly boring. It is also full of ""funny"" racist jokes, such as a Chinese man working with Rhody being unable to say his name correctly. Tony is portrayed as a pathetic, petulant whiner. There is literally nothing in this movie that you would want to expose to a kid- or yourself. I am both a cheapskate and a nerd but I still threw this thing in the garbage bin. If you need some Iron Man in your life, skip this junk and buy the live action movies or Armored Adventures instead."
2,Major disappointment,"I feel I am among the minority of people being happy with ""Ultimate Avengers"" movies from Marvel and Lionsgate, especially by the first one. Unfortunately, this outing has nothing to do with them. Neither the character of Tony Stark is the same, nor music, nor the visuals, neither the quality of the story, so I have second thoughts about getting ""Dr. Strange"" from the same studios."
1,Worst Ever--Story and Animantion,"The movie is horrible, does no justice to the character. The best animation you get is on the front cover and that's the only place you will see the Mandarin, he never shows in the movie. The story is awful and makes no sense; it's so bad that I barely made it to the end. No sure what Marvel was thinking when they real3eased it. Stay away from it at all costs."
2,Watched this to evade boredom. Failed,"I watched this on my portable DVD player while waiting for my car to be repaired at the dealership. It was a pretty boring film, but I continued to watch it as I had nothing better to do. ""Blues Clues"" was on the waiting room television, and was mildly more interesting than this bad version of Iron Man.By the way. Why does every film about a superhero have to recap the origin of the superhero? Why can't we just say; ""He's a millionaire, he wears an iron suit, he blows stuff up."" You could probably do that during the opening credits. We don't recap James Bond's origin every time..."
3,Acceptable,"Artwork Good at times, but inconsistent. Pacing was slow. Story and liberties with the character's history were acceptable for me. I think Ultimate Avengers was better, but both failed to meet the expectations that Marvel sold to its fans."
3,ok iron man movie...,"the animation is pretty good in this one, but the story isn't as good as ultimate avengers 1. a not bad, not great iron man origin movie."
3,What a drag...,"I was excited to see this film, but it sucked the happy right out of me. A achingly-slow story coupled with weak cliched characters, plus jumps in logic too hackneyed even for animation, render this crud a quick trip to nap-ville. (At least I enjoyed an unplanned sleepy time about 3/4 into ""Iron Man"".) The CGI reminded me of the old anime ""Lensman"": used mostly without flair, and totally lifeless compared to the regular animation.If you must have this dud, wait until it shows up eventually in the $5.50 bin, alongside those other mishaps, the Ultimate Avengers films. Tony Stark's pencil mustache should be cause enough to stay away."
3,acceptable,I am not much of an Iron Man fan and but since he is a Marvel charactor I thought check it out and see what they did with it. I was surprise It has a pretty good story line. I like it more than I thought I would have. I would as say it is an acceptable version it doesn't wow you but it is good family entertainment. Can't wait to see the Doctor Strange one that I think will be a good one.
4,"INVINCIBLE OR NOT...THIS ""IRON MAN"" IS NOT BAD","It appears that the big wigs at MARVEL want to get as much wattage out of their product and produce merchandise that continues to ""re-vamp"" their cannon of characters. This foray into the ""Invincible Iron Man"" is more in the vien of what we've seen with the recent ""Ultimate Avengers"" line and is really very dramatically portrayed. It's not great...the animation stands to be tweaked still...but the combination of computer-wizardry to bring to life Iron Man is quite engaging.If you're a fan and anxiously awaiting the upcoming big screen venture, this is for you, but the real nugget here is the sneak-peek into the next MARVEL animation release: DOCTOR STRANGE! Now that's one property they can evolve into a fantastic series!"
3,Weird Clash of Eras,"I collected comics as a kid (and now that they've been releasing the collections on DVD, I've bought those as well), so I really enjoyed the two Avengers DVDs. I was looking forward to this Ironman DVD. All in all, I enjoyed it, but the whole retro vibe didn't work for me. The cars look like they're from 1950, and the China setting--everybody looked like they came out of some Fu Manchu movie from 1930. I would have rather seen them do a complete modern update. I really liked the use of CGI though. I thought it looked really cool and worked well."
2,Not great for kids,"I bought this movie with the anticiaption of getting my kid into Iron Man with the new movie out on the big screen. I was disappointed with the cartoon due to 90% of the movie is build up and only the last 10% is Iron Man fighting and action that a young kid could follow. This movie appears to appeal to an older generation or maybe even some older kids into comic books, not good for little kids."
1,dissapointed iron fan....,"I was really excited about this movie with the new fangled( who says new fangled anymore) cgi animation mixed with trditional, andf it was decent, not the best I'd ever seen. Kinda reminded me of the old G.I.Joe's where they all walked stiff and talked with little expression. I applaud them using tony stark as the playboy he was, but the story was horrible and the mandarin could have been used so much better. That was really weak. Anyway, I think this will disapoint any die hard iron man fan. I hope doctor strange redeems this movie."
4,Bare Bones,"Any afficionado of King Lear will appreciate the nuances developed in any performance of the play. While this version is the bare bones of the play's plot, with much left out, this production comes closest to what Shakespeare could have done writing for the screen rather than the stage. The feeling of place, the condition of the kingdom's impacted peasantry unrepresented in the Dramatis Personae, is the finest of all filmed performances of this play, and I've seen them all. The cinematography is a work of art in its own right, sometimes as stunning and disturbing as the play's most compelling dialogue. For one unfamiliar with the play, this film would be an adequate introduction, but for a student with a deepening and abiding interest, it is a Must Have."
3,Simple stand,"The packaging was very poor. It looked as if the box had been sitting on a shelf for years. The box was flimsy and it was ripped in a few spots. The product was fine, nothing appears to be wrong with it but it very easily could have been damaged. I put the stand together and it went together well but doesn't appear very sturdy. I guess we'll see once we put the guitars on it. I haven't put any on it yet because the stand is a gift along with the guitar."
5,Made a little boy very happy!,Most Godzilla figures I've came across are not made to play with.This one however can be handled and played with! I gave it to my grandson for Christmas he loved it and it can stand up to lots PLAY !!!!! The seller was great . The toy came when it was suppose to and I would most definitely order from this seller again~!
3,Lighthearted and humorous,"In this book Markoe's character (whose name is never revealed) decides that in order to take control of her life and try to make it better she will keep a ""diary"" of sorts that she only makes entries in, on her birthday. Each year she will chronicle the events of past year, and hope to learn something. Every woman can relate to the character's experiences with dating, and the at times futile attempts to please her parents!Overall the book is funny, dialoge between the main character and her parents is hilarious. Her experiences dating are funny as well. I did think content explored in each chapter became repititious at times and thought at times the main character became a little too insightful and serious, which was very different than the rest of the tone in the book.Overall it was a funny, quick read. A nice break from some of the more ""serious"" books out there!"
2,Trash.,"What a horrible book. I don't think I've ever read a book where someone complained through the entire thing. The book is about a woman who decides to journal her birthdays to see if she has made improvements in her life. If you don't like something in your life, change it.. stop complaining. For someone who is 36 years old she acts like a whiny teenager. I just wanted to grab her by the shoulders, shake her and say ""stand up for yourself.. for once!"". She's pushed around by everyone in her life. She doesn't stand up to anyone. What a disappointment."
2,Didn't get off the ground,"I love the viking trilogy, but this one(3rd)never seemed to get off the ground. Selig wasn't convincing as being sooo upset with Erika. Erika was in turn too weak for my taste. And I loved Hearts Aflame, but Kirsten from that book took up way too much space in this one and was nasty. i was wondering if it was the same Kirsten or a new one. I didn't understand how Selig's mother could even tolerate her son doing the things he did to Erika, being how strong she was in Fires of Winter. She of all people should understand how Erika felt, but she didn't. Even Garrick, you'd think he would've said something. this was a boring Lindsey read. If you're not an avid Lindsey reader, pass this one up. She seemed rushed to make a 3rd book for this trilogy, and it shows."
1,DO NOT BUY!!! Item not as described!,"Do not buy this cable. It is a 3 ft. cable, not a 6 ft. cable as stated. I was terribly disappointed, and wished I looked at the reviews as another person had the exact same problem. Other than the length, the cable itself works perfectly fine, and I just use it to charge my controller when I'm not playing.If you want to buy the real 6 ft. cable buy it from this listing:http://www.amazon.com/Controller-Charge-Cable-Black-Playstation-3/dp/B003A0T6YS/ref=pd_sim_vg_1It is the same price, and you get the real deal. Hope this helps~!"
1,this cable is worthless,"i bought this cable a long time ago, and it did not charge any of my controllers. so then the seller contacts me saying that they will send me another one if i take my first bad review off. well guess what they have not sent me anything. so here is your bad review again. THIS CABLE IS GARBAGE!! PLEASE DONT BE ENTICED BY THE LOW PRICE!! I bought the cable and everytime i tried to operate my controller with the cable, my ps3 would give me a message saying the controller was not connected."
3,Gibbons Decline and fall of Rome,"This is the definitive History of the Empire from the first emperor (Agustus or Octavian, if you wish). However given the time and hence style of English, it was written in it is not for the faint hearted. Stick with it though and it is a very rewarding reference book which you will have for life.One thing I fail to understand is what Amazon sells Vols 1-3 and 4-6 as seperate items. By the lot in one go otherwise it's a bit like owning the old testement bible and not having set eyes on the New Testement.!!"
1,"Great Idea, Poor Performance...","I wanted to swap to a plastic brush that was one piece to avoid mildew issues that can arise with wooden and/or two-piece brushes. This brush seemed ideal. However, they both broke within 4 days of arrival. One drop in the shower was all it took and the whole handle below the rubber grip breaks. I'm going back to wood for sure, and if you're planning on purchasing this I wouldn't use it in any other location save the bathtub. Higher up and you're asking for the inevitable."
4,Land Trusts,Great book for intro to land trusts. Can get deep and should be used alongside of a personal study course. Simple concepts and includes CD of forms that are needed...
4,Review,"The product was fully functional and the DVD was in good condition. I only wish the original box had come with it, but the fault is mine for not reading the description of the product more carefully and throughly."
5,New Tricks III,"All good, love these guys, the stories and the humor. A great watch. Grabbing all the episodes for my collection."
5,A Quirky Pleasure,"This is a British variation on the cold case theme. For the most part, the cases are cold but not ancient. The cast is tight, funny and believable without all of the usual solved-in-court nonsense. Each episode features a believable plot pursued by a tight ensemble."
4,"A good start, but get the Fonovisa version if you can find it","This is currently the only Cristian Castro CD I have, because I haven't much liked anything else he's done since. Some don't really like the CD because the songs aren't as polished as they should have been, but I think they were a lot better than anything he's done since. Besides, I'm sure even Luis Miguel wasn't so polished when he released his first album, and he was younger than Cristian was.One other thing: If you can find it, try to get the original Fonovisa release of ""Agua Nueva."" Universal Latino's remastering not only changed the track order, but I went through three separate copies of it, all of which had various digital ""pops."" I finally managed to find a Fonovisa copy off of ebay."
5,Gentlemen's Blood,"""Gentlemen's Blood"" is undoubtedly the most entertaining and informative book about dueling that I have yet read. Baldick's ""The Duel"" is a close runner-up, but that author doesn't match Barabara Holland's wry writing style. She is well-versed on her facts and her dueling lore, and displays an amazing breadth of knowlege of the subject. Her exposition of the whole concept of ""honor"", and the associated concept of ""gentleman"", are as lucid and thoughtful as any reader could hope for, but never tedious. Once begun, this is a hard book to put down."
5,Dancing in the light,"I brought extra books to give as gifts, wonderful reading books about the life and lives of shirley Maclaine. Recommend."
4,just in time.,I started culinary school and I needed this before we started knife technics and its perfect. It has really helped in some of the positions needed. Thanks a bunch.
2,"Some useful information, lots of errors","While this book covers the basics of terminology and is a decent quick review of anatomy, etc., the number of errors in it make it rather difficult to use. The answer keys in the appendix for end of chapter reviews and quizzes have major errors in them, as do several of the figures.(For example, in chapters 8 and 9, the answer keys to multiple choice questions list letters that are not even options.) There must be a better publication out there to learn med terminology. Why wasn't this reprint edited???!! The CD that comes with the book is helpful."
1,Diva Diamonds is VERY Deceptive,"This product is only a gold shell. They list the total metal weight and imply that is the gold weight, but it is a very thin gold shell and the rest is cheap metal. I did not realize this at first because the other metal parts are painted gold, but after 6 months when the paint wore off and I could tell it was not really gold they refused to take the cheap piece of junk back. I am very upset as this was a keepsake gift for my daughter's 16th birthday.14K Yellow Gold Oval Shaped Locket"
4,Keeping Fit @ 50+,Realizing that exercise is especially important as I age; I am glad I purchased this CD. It is clear and concise and easy to follow. As my body adjusts to the core exercises I can add the more advanced movements provided to my routine. Very good if you are interested in a light/moderate workout.
3,Very Interesting,"Green River's COME ON DOWN is one of those albums that you own to satisfy curiosity more than to listen to. There are at least two grunge classics on this album (""Come On Down"" and ""Swallow My Pride""), and some filler stuff too. Mostly you wouldn't imagine these guys going on to form Pearl Jam, but it is very believable that Mark Arm and Steve Turner stepped up to Mudhoney from here. If you like Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, just be warned that this sounds NOTHING like what they've gone on to do since. If you like Mudhoney, this is sort of like the Young Mudhoneys."
5,Little Miss Marvelous,"This is a great, fun movie. Walter Matheau is always a treat to watch. I believe this is the 3rd remake of ""little Miss Marker"", the first with Adolf Menjou and Shirley Temple and the 2nd made in the early 60's with Tony Curtis (taking the little girl to Disneyland. This version from the early 80's is set in the depression era, with Tony Curtis as the villain. I recommend this movie for the whole family"
1,Better title: A Tiny Slice of the Rig Veda,".Not knowing anything about the work, I foolishly assumed the 108 selected hymns represented a major part of the work. In fact, this book contains about 10% of the Rig Veda.Admittedly, it took her 341 pages to do 108 hymns so a full rendition might run 3,410 pages. But I wish the book description had been honest enough to say what a small selection the editor made, alerting the neophyte to the immensity of the actual work."
2,Disappointed,"Redneck Riviera normally refers to Panhandle of Florida, but book more geared to land swindles in Central and South Florida. Felt title misrepresented content of book."
4,"come on...it's nick, for god's sake. what else can be said?","All right, let's get right down to it...""Tupelo."" I mean, even though ""Tender Prey"" is easily Cave's masterwork, ""Tupelo"" is by far his greatest song to date. Simultaneously referring to the births of Jesus Christ, Elvis Presley, and Cave himself, the lyrical imagery here is stunning...even, I will admit, better than ""The Mercy Seat."" Cave's obsession with death and religion working at full force here. (trivia: nick had a twin brother who died at birth...and he was also born with a tail, which was surgically removed immediately after his birth) truth? fiction? who can even draw the line here? Brilliant."
2,False Title,"I have only read about 5% of the book and am already annoyed because the book is titled, ""Favorite GREEK Myths,"" and yet the Roman gods names are being used. Yes the myths of Greeks and Romans are almost exactly the same, but still when writting about GREEK gods, the GREEK names should be honored!"
2,None,I am amazed that this book was allowed to be published under the title Greek Myths when the Roman names for the gods throughout.
2,The battery system needs rethinking.,"My battery pack would not charge, strait out of the new box. The phone number led only to confution."
5,"Very Cute, but the battery no good.","looks very cute, but the battery 's life too short, need charge all the time, and can not doing charge and play MP3 at same time."
3,like kissing someone& getting slapped back.,"i bought this a few years ago, and i was a bit young, and expected so much from this, seeming how it had been heralded her ""greatest"" album.i didn't understand why anyone liked her when i first listened to it. her vocals sounded strangled, like she COULD sing, but wouldn't, and the guitar/organs had a bleak, anorexic feeling to it. pj harvey looking psychotic and sick in the cd booklet topped it off.but, since then, i've grown accustomed to getting spit on by this record by it's chill and noise.this isn't a record you can snuggle up to, it would be kind of masochistic to love on it.i LIKE this record. i think it's pj harvey's worst, mainly because it's so hard to get into.... not good for a pj harvey beginner.if you like sweeter harvey, get ""stories from the city"" or ""is this desire""if you like something a little more unpolished... ""dry"""
3,Worth listening,"I am not really a fan of this genre of music, but this project has been interesting."
5,Solid,"I was just reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews and I'm floored. This has got to be one of PJ Harvey's best, and most accessible, albums but people are lamenting how it's unlistenable and how they would rather use the CD as a coaster. I heared once that the average album is listened to 1.5 times, which is probably true, but very sad. Do people really want instant gratification when it comes to music? If that's what you want, then listen to the radio where you'll get the same old drivel offending your ear drums on tight rotation all day long.To Bring You My Love is a fantastic album. And even today in 2012, 17 years after its release, it still sounds fresh and vibrant. May PJ Harvey bring us her love for many years to come.Recommend. Buy it. Listen to it. Quit complaining."
1,Southern Rock? Hardly....,"I hate to say it, but agree with other reviewers about this album. This is not Southern ""Rock"" even in the slightest sense.I would classify it more as ""lite"" country rock with slight ""gospel"" overtones. To call it ""sappy"" would be cruel, but not to far off the mark.There is not one ""foot stompin'"" or ""toe tappin'"" tune to be found on the entire disc; it's flat out ""boogie-less"". Plus the constant one syllable word, child like rhyming lyrics were too much for me to take.White, might, right....red, bed, dead....Sam, am, ham.....ad nauseum. While listening to this, I kept saying to myself ""someone in this band is a Dr. Seuss fan"". I grabbed this out on the cd player half way through and popped in ""Molly Hatchet's Greatest Hits"" (a must have cd by the way). And on this point I am serious, the ""best"" song on this album would be the worst song on the worst album by Hatchet, Skynyrd, Allmans, Marshall Tucker, Gov't Mule etc...."
4,Appears to be stong Anchor line,"Nice and soft to handle. Made in China (like everything else). If you normally use 3/8, you might want to go to 1/2 as the double braid makes it appear smaller. All in all I think it's a good product for the price."
4,extra yummy -- featuring food and Shampoo,"Two episodes from the TV Hard battle Series(1) Dim Sum Darling: Shampoo attempts to combine magic with her cooking skills to force Ranma to fall in love with her. Things become complicated when the spell inadvertently involves Akane.(2)Rub-A-Dub-Dub! There's A Pervert In The Tub!: This episode features Happosai's perversion, otaku delight.This volume is another one to round out a collection. The first episode is wonderful with all the food references and silly situations while the 2nd episode provides ample opportunities for fan service which are not wasted. Probably one of the better TV series volumes."
4,Where'd They Get These Voices?,"This video is really a cut above the average. The production values are super and my just-turned four-year-old daughter likes it a lot. I was dismayed, however, to find the mice of Brambly Hedge speaking with American accents, badly tinged here and there with something not quite British. It sounds like the producers ransacked the high school drama club for some cheap talent. The U.S. licensee apparently decided that our American kids couldn't follow an English accent. Wrong. Result: the video looks lots better than it sounds. I was disappointed."
3,I totally overpaid.,"Firstly, the book does not look like the picture. I'm guessing I got an older edition. This should have been mentioned. I'm ok with the older edition, but for some books this matters.Secondly, the book has writing in it. A seller should mention in his description if there is writing, regardless of the quality level - good, very good, acceptable, etc. If I had known there was writing in this book, I would not have bought it!A bad purchase on my part."
2,Pages Missing,"I've used this book before, but I was terribly disappointed when I discovered that it had pages missing. I should really send it back, but I'm a busy teacher who doesn't have time to mess with this. I don't think I'll purchase anything used again."
2,Spenser led me to expect better,"What a sad-sack this recovering-alcoholic character is. I understand this author's need to branch out, to perhaps prove he can write something beyond ""Spenser""; but Jesse Stone has none of the cleverness, likability or humor of a Spenser. In the first of these I read, the character mentions in passing his acquaintance with Spenser, up in Boston; and my bored-to-tears heart actually started racing with hope, as though a rock star might appear. (Which he didn't.) I have a friend who reads these when there's nothing else, and finds them palatable enough. Sadly, I do not."
5,Trouble in Paradise,Another fantastic installment. This is one of the best series that I have ever read. I can't read these books fast enough.
4,nice series,After watching the shows on TV I decided to read the books. Talk about different. I really like the books a lot better.
3,Be a man - dump the ex,"Yeah, he's tough. Sure. Why doesn't he get some self-respect and dump his slut ex-wife? This guy gets more action than Bill Clinton, yet he keeps setting himself up for a fall with Jenn.Otherwise both the Jesse Stone books were fun reads-largely due to Parker's skill as a writer."
5,throwed,"the video was throwed it showed the real, how everything started poppin in H-Town people was hating and some still are but they cant hate on the way them boys put it down that video show some real downsouth game"
4,Terribly Sad Little Book,"Like many others, this book was one of our mandatory reads for school. However it is a tiny little book barely over 100 pages. Yet it is terribly sad and opens the reader to the many injustices of the world. It follows an Egyptian woman named Fridaul growing up in a peasent/farming enviroment to becoming a prostitute in Cairo. In this journey she encounters multitudes of deceptive and generally horrible people. Fridaus grows up naive and unaware she is taken advantage up and eventually becomes hardened by all the hardships she faces. This is a terrific book, a quick read, and one that will really leave a mark."
5,Excellent Look at the Life of Muslim Women,"This is a wonderful book. Yes, it is sad and difficult to read through emotionally, but the book gives us excellent insight to how many Muslim women feel --trapped. I'm thankful Nawal El Saadawi took the time to give us this gift."
3,Good overview. Balanced,"Malpas' discussion of the phenomenon of Postmodernism is quite well-balanced and clear. He incorporates the ideas of many of the major thinkers of the era and makes logical sense of a sometimes illogical set of ideas. Strong on Lyotard and Habermas. Much clearer than Christopher Butlers ""A Very Short Introduction to Postmodernism"" (OUP)"
1,self promoting auther,"Self serving attempt to make a quick buck off of terriosm. Author lacks clear facts, uses to many ""undisclosed sources""."
5,Tells it like it is in the Bush Administration...,"Please don't be turned off on this book from some of the other reviewers with an obvious agenda (i.e. an extreme right-wing agenda) who bash this book. The authors present facts about how the current administration has and continues to mislead the American public in many different areas. This book should not be lumped into the same category as Iven's and Franken's recent offerings, it is much more technical and goes into excruciating detail when making it's points. Read this and judge for yourself. Btw, take what ""Doctor"" James S. Moore says with a grain of salt... for a sec there I thought he was a real doctor, but I wasn't suprised to discover he is really a psychologist. Look at his other reviews if you don't believe me, the guy's a crackpot."
4,Strawberry Wine,Strawberry Wine is one of the greatest songs ever written. What sucks is it was written by a band that is completely unknown. (Try even Googling this band) Every bit as good and trippy as anything Pink Floyd or Radiohead have ever done.
2,not quite what it says it is,"I bought it on rec from a friend. I had been looking for old patterns for socks, just translated into todays lingo (i.e. what yarns are now available and what some of the assumptions of the time were).I was totally disappointed. Rather than keep to the original ""VINTAGE"" pattern, the original is thrown out altogether and the author merely makes a ""similar"" sock with totally different weights and materials for yarn and needles far to large to be in a ""VINTAGE"" pattern. For all the reader knows, she merely made up the patterns, stuck a piece of clipart in and called them vintage.What was needed (and expected by the title) was the original pattern, equivalent yarns and needles and THEN, a modern twist on same. Then at least you could see a connection and progression.Currently, nice enough patterns, but not vintage, just ""nice""wouldn't recommend it if you really want to knit a sock that measures up to a true ""VINTAGE"" sock."
5,Live your life for Half the Price: Without sacrificing the Life You Love,"Wonderful Reading and Great Tips on getting what you want for a Half the Price ! Everyone needs to start thinking of the future and saving ! She really helps you see the big picture on saving, bills, Credit Cards, and Loans. A Must have book."
5,Great deal. Makes ball look even better.,It will keep the ball safe and it keep it looking great. I might have to get another one for my other autographed ball.
3,Item received was different that what was posted,"From the photo, I was under the impression that I was buying GIANT now and laters. What I received were the regular sized now and laters. I went out of my way to order these from Amazon only to be disappointed that I received something different. I will be returning them."
1,No Way!1,"If you're looking for talant this is not for youTalent use to mean somethingNot no more. Everyone wants a recording contract, the truth is, only a very, very few are good enough.This is a bunch of hype."
5,Amazing film on every level,"I cannot say enough positive things about this movie it is one of my all time favorites. It has everything going for it. It has everything we as men have endured in our lives...causing mischief, wilderness adventures, friendships, and tragedy. Any man or boy will surely relate to this movie in one way or another and that's exactly how it succeeds so brilliantly. The late Brad Renfro does a terrific performance as does Mazzello. Also featuring an outstanding performance by Annabella Sciorra. One of the rare films that can still bring a tear to my eye no matter how many times I see it. A must see for all."
5,GREAT FILM,This excellent movie explores the human --rather than the scientific-- dimensions of what it means to be healthy. Its success in this really outweighs its minor failings. Tremendous movie!
5,this is my favorite movie!!!,"This is a great movie! It is the only movie that ever made me cry. As soon as it was over the first time I watched it, I just rewound it and watched it all over again immiaditly twice in a row. It's that good! It's very touching, and at times it's hilarious! You'll LOVE this movie!"
2,lsn review,"i was unsatisfied with the item because it began like the mighty, which is a movie i have grown to love but then i quickly became lost as i tried to follow the plot line. i did not totally understand the entire movie and where it was going. i was unsatisfied with how it showed the dead body in the casket at the end. it seemed like the movie ended abruptly."
4,Go to their website,"I really don't know how to label these guys... it's hard to find a comparison. They are kind of all over the place, while still remaining distinct. The sample previews give you a pretty good idea of what you're getting into. So, I say that if those intrigue you go for it!Most of the tracks on this album used to be free for download off their website. In fact, there are a couple newer ones there now from their new Fight Club EP (Velella.net yo!). BTW, the EP is much better, and you can tell that the group is progressing, and refining their sound into something truly awesome. It's more grooving, funky, and makes people wanna dance. In fact, my friend went to one of their shows and said it was like a dance party. YOU CAN ORDER BOTH THIS AND THE EP FROM THE WEBSITE FOR $15. Sweet deal, that's a lot of music for $15.Ya I know this review isn't so helpful, but it's the only one."
4,Another good release from Sonata Arctica,"After listening to Silence for 3 weeks straight, I decided to buy Winterheart's Guild. I first listened with high expectations and was somewhat dissatisfied. After a couple more listens, I really enjoyed tracks like The Cage and Victoria's Secret. Although this is not Sonata Arctica's strongest release, it is definetely worth 15 dollars. I really liked Silence because as a song ended, I anticipated the beginning of the next track. I hope that in time, Winterheart's Guild will have the same effect on me."
4,A good solid album,"I loved The Cranberries debut album, and wasn't disappointed in this one at all. I bought it on the strength of ""Zombie"" which I thought was a real good song. Although I think it's not quite up to their debut album (which is why I gave it 4 stars), I still think it's a very good album. The 18 page booklet is nice...all the lyrics, plus lots of colour photos of the group."
4,Emotional,"This is definatly the CD that made me like the cranberries.... unfortunatly they have not done anything like it again :-(.This album is wonderful, full of emotion, good rock mixed with amazing vocals and very very touching... I think that Zombie is a good song but NOT the best song this album can offer (my fav is Ridicules Thoughts). The reason this album doesn't get 5 stars (some of the trackes definalty worth it) is that although most of the songs are spell-bonding few are not and they 'spoil the line'.All in all this is a real classic."
5,Craberries are awesome,"I bought the CD a while ago for the song ""Zombie"" and because a friend said it was good. The first time I listened to the CD I was a little disappointed becuase I was expecting more songs like Zombie, but I don't regret getting the CD. I LOVE IT! I listen to it all the time now."
2,I HATE THIS DVD,This is the worst dvd that I own from SS. It is old & they are sellin it like it is brand new. It says 2004 but the quality is the worst like it may have been made in the 1990's.My son did not pay it much attention either. Get the All-Star Alphabet that one is fantastic... We both love that one...
5,Great Sesame Street Movie!,"This Sesame Street video is great! Its old school. I looked it up and it is actually from the 80s not 2010. I'm guessing they turned it to DVD in 2010. Anyways. It is GREAT if you love old sesame street. But if you are expecting Elmo and Abby the fairy. You will be disappointed. It starts with Snuffy wanting to know his letters and Big Bird says he will teach them to him. With Telly's help. Telly and Big Bird have the biggest parts in the movie. Personally I love it because I'm a huge Cookie Monster fan, and this has his signature ""C is for Cookie, It's good enough for me, C is for Cookie, Good enough for me!"" Song. Oh i love it! My son and i have watched this movie soooo many times!"
4,bring back the old sesame street...PLEASE,THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO FOR CHILDREN. IT IS THE OLD SESAME STREET AT IT'S BEST. THE NEW SESAME STREET IS OK BUT THE OLD SESAME STREET IS MUCH BETTER FOR CHILDREN.
3,A wonderful book.,"An outstanding book, especially for those who like Garfield. The story is about a man who is going through a tough time. When he looses his girlfriend he finds this dog. As to only make things worse, the dog soon begins to talk to him, but the dog will only speak to him. This author has caught the mind of a dog so very well. This book does include some British humor that I did not understand but caught on quickly. A wonderful book for the whole family, and those who have dogs.During the middle of the book it tends to get slow, but then gets faster. This book follows a man during his hard times, but his dog is always there to help and cheer him up. You will never look at your dog the same."
4,Lucky Dog,This is a quirky book for readers who enjoy British humor and can suspend reality to believe a talking dog. The protagonist's gambling addiction collides with his strong sense of morality in never lying (bluffing in poker doesn't count) or cheating his real estate clients. This title has been very popular with library patrons and makes a good discussion book.
3,Not as good as everyone thinks,"Most people praise this movie as being a triumph for Jackie (he views it as his best directorial work), but there is a reason that Hollywood doesn't make these melodramas anymore. Yes there is a story, but who really cares if Jackie and friends pull of the deceipt? The 1950s type story doesn't work and seems very corny. That being said, the few fight scenes are very good, and the film is beautifully shot. But you are now warned."
4,miracles,"its a pretty good movie. very touching but the quality isnt perfect and the acting and stuff isnt that awesome either. other than that, the action's great. jackie chan does a good job."
5,A Great Album,"I bought this album on tape a few years ago when I was working in Dallas, TX. One of the local radio stations used to play old country music by request and they often played Blue Eyes Crying In the Rain and Faded Love. I finally had to go buy me a Willie Nelson tape so I could play it in my rental car. If you are going to be stranded on a desert island, and you can only take one Willie Nelson album, this is the one."
4,Good Value,"This set was an inexpensive alternative to most store brand pieces. Its basic and requires a little technique to get the tap or die started, but it did its job and was only a fraction of the cost of much lesser sets."
2,Not Quite What I Expected,"On my old vacuum I used my crevice tool every time I cleaned - under the stove, under the fridge, sofa, etc. So when I saw that the dyson came only with what I would consider to be a mini crevice tool, I ordered this flexible one. It sounded great in the description and I thought it would be very useful. Well, I'm much less impressed than I thought I'd be. I used it once and my opinion is that it really isn't flexible. The ""flexi"" part is made of rubber - similar to one of those black rubber tie-downs with the hoods on each end. When you flex it, it bends completely shutting off air-flow. Since it pinches off, I don't consider this flexible. I expect flexible attachments to bend without interferring with the performance of the product. This tool sits in my cleaning closet now very rarely used. A side note - its in my cleaning closet because there is no way to attach it to the vacuum itself. :( Not what I expected from a Dyson."
3,not a direct replacement for a firex 5000,"The smoke detector, as delivered, is actually a 5000A. This is a different model, and not directly interchangeable with the 5000.If you are replacing a Firex 5000, you will have to replace the mounting bracket, turn off the power, and install a new wiring harness. Not that hard, but if you were looking for a direct replacement, this is not it.Don't get me wrong, it's not that hard to do, but make sure you're comfortable re-wiring and installing standing on that high ladder! The difference should be noted in the product description. The box clearly says 5000A, the product description on this site says 5000. Not what I was expecting."
2,You can Do,Leslie Sansone - You Can Do AbsI was a little disappointed in this workout dvd. I was looking to enhance my exercise ball workout and thought that this would give it to me. But is was really a started workout with the exercise ball. If you've never used an exercise ball this would be for you. But if you have been doing a routine with the exercise ball this is not for you. I expected (since I've used Leslie Sansone walking dvd and got great workouts with them) a better and longer workout and this was not the case.
5,The prince of creativity.,"It`s not about time, not about trends and certainly not about money.This is music.Nothing more to say.Essential."
1,embarrassing,"love making teeny-condom music. dont buy this. buy massive attack and cannibal corpse, tricky used to be in cannibal corpse before he got kicked out for being stupid. now his music is on condom commercials."
4,GREAT DEBUT; THIS IS THE TRICKY YOU WILL WANT.,"I HAVE MANY MAXIVE ATTACK AND PORTISHEAD CDS, I BOUGHT TWO TRICKY CDS; MAXINIQUE AND PRE-MILLINEUM. MAXINIQUE IS THE ONE TO HAVE. IT CONTINUES THE MELLOW THEME OF HIS PREVIOUS COLLABORATIONS. I'D STAY AWAY FROM PRE-MILLINEUM, IT'S DOES SOMETHING TO TRICKY'S VOICE THAT CAN START A HEADACHE...SOME OVER OR UNDER SYNTHESIZED NOISE."
4,Absolutely Magnificent,"This album is simply stellar. Tricky easily demonstrates why he is considered THE recognized force in Trip-Hop. Simply put, Tricky demonstrates his grasp of all the mystery and malevolence of the genre, while exceeding and defining it. For lovers of raw texture and sonic intricacy in their music, this is a must. But don't tell all your friends, because you'll want this all for yourself!"
1,A fatally flawed design,"Looks great, blades may be great, knife won't fit the blades in a safe and reliable way. Do not get unless you keep the package so as to return it if the design has not been improved. Absolutely useless, and I had a talented carpenter look at it to see if I was missing something; he said, No way it can work, even with its own blades. As a tool collector, I have 3 or 4 other utility knives of original design and all of them work fine; this one just did not go through a beta testing phase--or, like Microsoft Office 3, it did and they ignored the findings!"
4,Disfuntional Final Fantasy!,"Slayers is one of those anime that could be turned into a video game, and not lose any of it's storyline. Those people who enjoy video games such as RPG's (Role Playing Games) are bound to love this show. The main character is Lina Inverse, a young girl who's temper is rivaled only by the spells she casts. Throughout the show companions join up with her, such as a dumber-then-dirt swordsman and an insane over-rightous girl.The animation in this show is alright; I've seen better in such animes as Fushigi Yugi or Cowboy Bebop. My main complaint, though, is that in the earlier stages of the show it seems to be just one battle after another, and they all seem begin and end the same way with a buch of beasts surrounding he heros, and the heros beating them again and again and again.Overall, the show is enjoyable and funny anime that all ages will find amusing."
3,A Change of Pace,"At first, my children showed little interest in this video because they are used to watching the more modern, computerized visual effects now used on Sesame Street. But, after watching it a few times, they are showing much more interest in it. There are many sesame street classics in this video that are enjoyable and my son has learned to count better, but the reason why my children tend to lose interest is because too much time and emphasis is put on Big Bird's role as a talk show host."
2,Nice book but at a cost....,Everything as far as the quality of the book is true...however I cannot resell it to anyone anymore so here I am stuck with it and cannot recuperate my costs when I try to sell it again....oh well...
1,a french Zombie movie... I got what I expected,"I know I'm just another low-brow guy... But holy Christ! The cover of this movie uses the phrase ""Zombie Movie"" on both front and back. So I thought hey, Lets see how the french do Zombies. So I watched it last night, I wish I could turn back time and have the ""Magic"" of not knowing how the french do Zombies again, Because my imagination was WAY BETTER than the way french realy do Zombies.I fell asleep twice during the movie.There are no Zombies, Just a bunch of emotional artsy drama that was way over my head... I would say there was no blood in the entire movie, But I think someone bumps their head and so there might a little. Oh and someone Shouts too.Tom Savini you need to throw another REAL ZOMBIE MOVIE at us again, it's been 16 years man!"
3,I love I Spy games.,The game played nicely. I wanted to play it again but can't find it. May have loaned it to someone.
1,Descent into Hell,"Just the first page is an example of some of the worst writing I have ever read. The prose is convoluted and unreadable. He uses the word ""stairs"" when he means ""stares"". How basicly illiterate can you get?If this man can get published, there is real hope for all those neophyte writers out there. Keep throwing your manuscripts over the transoms --somebody's going to give you a chance."
2,Not what I wanted...,"With the title of ""Walking Cradle"" I was expecting a comfortable walking sandal. I bought these for my trip to Disney. I couldn't wear them more than a short time without them being uncomfortable. No way I could use them for the hours of walking in Disney World as I had hoped. They also squeeked! Sorry, these are pretty, but definitely not the comfortable walking sandal I was expecting when I purchased."
2,Math bomb,"This CD should be priced at $5.00. The graphics will not keep your child's attention and it's pretty lame. It was a wasted purchase, I have to bribe my child to use it, because it so boring."
2,OK but some serious problems,This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible. My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse. And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game. And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels. And...did they actually test this thing on humans? What a waste of potential. It is a good concept.
1,A HUGE Disappointment !!,"My son had an earlier version of Math Blaster, it was wonderful. I saw this new version and expected more of the same. WRONG!! After 10 minutes of loud sounds, and pulsing video, he was complaining. It was impossible to focus on what he should do with all the distracting background stuff. Never could get to a point where learning might take place. Wish I could get my money back.After this disaster, we purchased Mia's Math Adventure. This was more in tune with the first Math Blaster."
1,Not enough Math - - too much game,I bought this thinking it was an updated version of a Mathblaster computer game my older kids had years ago. It was a good review tool and they liked it. But this new Mathblaster is nothing like the old one. It is trying so hard to appeal to modern kids who play video games that there is too much gaming with very little math thrown in. I'm not happy with it at all since it's not really reviewing much math. My 9yo son sort of likes it because it's basically just another video game. But he doesn't really play it that much.
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This!!!!,"I purchased this program hoping to help my daughter improve her math skills. It says right on the box ""Master the Basics."" This is FALSE ADVERTISING!! My child is learning NO math doing this game. Because that's all it is really -- just a game. And the game is totally LAME!! If you want a lame video game, buy this. If you want math help for your child, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!"
1,sizing chart incorrect,I ordered the 3.5 big kid shoe based on the sizing chart in inches. The size states that it is 8 5/8 inches and the shoe is actually 8 inches long.
1,terrible,"so old-fashioned! one of the worst pregnancy books I`ve ever read! I kept waiting to read""just kidding!"" this book is awful. thank goodness it was free"
2,Why did I buy This?,"What's worse than a bad cd? ""The Burdens of Being Upright."" I don't even know where to start. I bought it because I really liked the first song ""Mother Mother"" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album. The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money. Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks. Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them. And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't."
1,"Screetchy and annoying--""ironic"" in an Alanis Morisette way","I was expecting something closer to a good voice, or at least someone attempting the lyric genius of Ani DiFranco. Both Tracy Bonham's screetchy and frequently flat delivery and her inarticulate message were off-putting. For some great women rockers who manage to preserve musical beauty along with their political and personal messages, check out any of the following: Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco (even in her most angry politically-charged work she maintains lyrical beauty and ocassionally musical loveliness), The Indigo Girls, Sarah McLaughlan, Bonnie Raitt (especially her early Blues-revival period), Paula Cole."
4,Grows on you,"I have to admit that at first I only liked the first song on this CD, but after listening to it a few times I found an appreciation for most of the songs. I find myself getting more and more into chick rock and Tracy Bonham is no exception. There is a wide range on this CD, everything from driving rock to a couple more soothing melodies. Tracy has written some moderately profound lirics, developed melodies that compliment well, and has a raspy voice that is a great alternative to all the overproduced music popular right now. All in all a worthy addition to my collection."
4,tracy rocks,of course radio overplayed MOTHER MOTHER and then moments later TRACY was a memory but i find many a song on this album to bring a smile on this face. from the soundgarden-esque TELL IT TO THE SKY to the nirvana influenced NAVY BEAN this album delivers something words fail to describe. THE ONE is such an awesome rockout song and i was singing BULLDOG for a week it is so catchy!!! i recommend this album.milkboydanny@hotmail.com
5,Beautiful and Useful Combined!,"Adkins' treatment of these beautiful fountains and how to create them is just what is needed by those of us who want to listen to their soothing sound and see their sparkling light at home. What is best, is the steps are so easy to follow!"
4,Calm and Compelling-Great Gift Idea,"Anyone who adores the calming sound of falling water, but can't afford an enormous water display should consult the ideas contained in this book. Ms. Adkins shows us, step by step, how each of us can embrace the fountain's relaxing flow, whether it be a small, tabletop display, a basin surrounded by lush green ferns or a full fledged waterfall plunging over the edge in magnificent wonder. Key among the many illustrations are the schematic drawings illustrating how the pump and tubing fit into the fountain itself, how to calculate and maximize the flow of water in your own fountain, tips and suggested tools and elements that compose each artistic water concept. Great gift idea."
2,retractable USB Cord,"I ordered this cord thinking that it would be a great space saver. Well after a few uses, the cord jamed and when I was trying to get it to retract it simply broke apart.... I still use the cord and I do like it, it just doesn't retract anymore...."
4,"Not quite Strange Highways, but good nonetheless","This is a pretty darn good effort by Dio. It's sort of a mix between angry machines and Magica. If you wanted something better than ""killing the dragon,"" here it is. If you're a Dio fan, it's definitely worth picking up. If you're a casual Dio fan, you might want to sample it first."
1,Finished,"The quality of this man's voice is gone, just like many other of his contemporaries, Dio's work and voice are a pitiful relic of an era full of racial prejudice, obtuse lyrics and satanic perversions.Since it appears he soon will be joining the priest shown in the holy diver cover, maybe he should spare the world from his ""art"".Don't waste your money like I did buying this mans CD'S and get something else."
2,Stay Away from DVD 22,"I had the exact same problem as Goldberg. It would power on but none of the functions would work and I would have to unplug it 4 or 5 times before it worked. Recently just shy of two years it completely crapped out. I had to break it apart to get my netflix disc out of it. I really liked the unit, it had great picture and audio quality, just didn't last that long. I have a HK receiver and it is fine. To replace my dvd 22, I got a Denon, but I have been looking at the new HKs. I think I like them better just a little apprehensive after my last dvd experience with them.."
5,Best reference for MSFP I have come across,"I've used FP since 1997. Each year I have purchased at least one reference book to help me optimize the product features. Most of the time, these books end up on my shelf because the instructions are more like stereo instructions. This book is one that I refer to regularly AND plan to purchase subsequent editions of. Directions are easy to follow and it is organized and indexed so that items are easy to find. The page layout is clear and clean. I would recommend this product to any level user of MSFP."
3,FrontPage 2000: The Almost Complete Reference,"FrontPage 2000: The Complete Reference is one of the better FrontPage book I have come across, the reason for an average rating is that the book has holes with in it. It presumes that everything is configured correctly, Personal Web Server, Server Extensions, etc If the book covered possible solutions to common problems it would be better. The only other gripe I had way the use of the words ""relatively simple process"" when it was not."
5,One of the BEST albums I've ever purchased (in any category),"If you like reggae at all, buy this album! The combination of strong beats and Buju's powerful reggae voice, made me a big fan right away. Songs like ""'Til I'm Laid to Rest"" and ""Champion"" seem to jump right out of the speakers. ""Wanna Be Loved"" has it all; great melody, impressive vocals, heartfelt lyrics, and a pulsating beat make it one of my favorite reggae songs of all time. The other tracks on the album are also great songs. This album is a necessity for any reggae fan."
2,what?,This book is a sad act of what happens when you lose sight of your goal. The book is covered nearly entirely from one point of view and only gives in depth detail about the people on one side of the conflict.In order for this book to be considered a true scholarly work it needs to do the following:1) add chapters on the loyalist commanders and those that followed the.2) add chapters for the Indians that chose not to allign themselves with the rebels.3) keep the current chapters and use them as a guide to compare and contrast with the new ones.I much prefr Gavin Watts book on the war in the Valley much more.
4,cookers,pretty good movie to watch. In depth meth addiction. You can almost feel the terror these people indure. very good purchase.
2,"Great music, stay away from the DualDisc","The songs are great. Shakira's lyrics are better than ever. HOWEVER, I unknowingly bought the dualdisc version as opposed to the cd. It locked up the player in my car before the first song was over. Now my cd player is inoperable, in fact, my car is sitting at the dealership as I write this. No warnings anywhere on the packaging. Stay away from the dualdisc."
3,Not This So good one As Waited!,"really waited something very good, but the truth is not it, the worst thing of everything is that although she doesn't accept it she put reggeaton rhythms because it is it that this hitting now, they bother me the artists that change of I generate to please, But LA TORTURA is very sticky, one that another good song but very mediocre for this album so prospective and so worked that it was."
5,Best Album of 2005!,"This is an amazing and beautiful album. This is by far, Shakira's most mature work. The album has very diverse type of songs. There is La Tortura with reggaeton influences, the bossonova tune Obtener Un Si, the electronic La Pared with a beautiful acoustic version included as well, and the alt-rock song La Imprescindible. This album shows off Shakira's love of mixing styles to come up with unique songs all her own. As always, Shakira's beautiful and unusual lyrics can be found throughout the CD. I would highly reccomend this album for fans of Shakira's other works and for music fans in general."
2,Shakira - produccion latina - musicos latinos,"Yo estaba esperando otra cosa. Despues que anuncio que planeaba dos discos, uno en espan~ol, y el otro en ingles, yo esperaba que el disco en espan~ol hubiese traido unas gran influencias latinas. Estuve muy equivocado.Con excepcion de ""La Tortura"", en ritmo de reggaeton, suena mas como la musica de artistas como Coldplay, pero cantado por Shakira. Y hablando de Coldplay, se copiaron de su tocar de piano. Si el nombre del productor, Rick Rubin, y los musicos que no me acuerdo sus nombre ahora, no suenan latinos, menos latino sono su estilo de tocar la musica.Obviamente le gusto a mucha gente le gusto y estoy en la minoria. Pero si crees que escucharas un poco de instrumentacion latina como la trompeta Mejicana de ""Ciego Sordomuda"" o los instrumentos de viento andinos en ""Suerte"" te equivocaras."
4,Good - With a Warning,"Overall, I think this CD is really good. The fact that she doesn't try to sound the same on every CD, like most popular stars, is one of the things that sets her apart. It shows her range as an actual artist, and not just the usual untalented recording industry fad.One warning, though. This dualdisc version carries a warning about how the audio side does not comform with CD specifications and may not play on all CD players...which at least in my case includes my computer CD player. It just won't work, and I can only listen on my stereo."
1,Spectra Premium Ind Inc SP6086M Fuel Pump,"I purchased this pump on Feb 19 2010 and installed the pump in my 2001 Silverado. Easy to install into the truck! On Aug 2 2011 the pump started failing. The fuel level sensor is starting to go, the fuel indicator on the dash started going to empty and then back to the level on fuel in the tank. I called the manufactor and they stated that they can do nothing for me and to buy another unit. Amazon also only has a 30 day warranty on the sale. So if you buy this unit from Amazon make sure you under stand it only has a 30 day warranty. The manufactor will not warranty the 1 year on the pump to the end user. So the warranty is useless. I would not buy this item again or anything from Amazon where Amazon does not warranty the manufactors warranty. I'm going to a auto parts store where the warranty is up held.Greg A."
5,"Review-Nobody Does It Like Me/Love, Life and Feelings",Excellent album. Contains most ballads and has everything on it that I was looking for.
4,"""Somebody"" just got me hooked","I saw her video for ""Somebody"" the other day and I fell in love with the song right away. Bonnie McKee has a beautiful and distinctive voice and she has a beautiful face to match. Her voice is very soulful and she weaves in a little gospel sound into her music. I already pre-purchase her new album. I can't wait to get it! Believe me she's going to household name soon."
4,Can't wait for her next book,"I enjoyed Hitchcock's first novel ""Trick of the Eye"" because it was different from your average mystery novel. Her second novel did not disappoint. It was interesting and kind-of quirky. The novel did reach a point where it became somewhat over-the-top but none the less it was fun and it kept me entertained.The story focuses on Beatrice O'Connell who has recently moved back in with her father who collects rare books. He receives a grimoire from a patient. A grimoire is a rare black magic book - usually from the 1300-1600's (or so). Intent on discovering the secret behind the book (after her father is murdered and the book disappears) Beatrice is lured into a bizarre world filled with interesting people, people who would do anything to harness the power held within the mysterious grimoire."
5,Written Verification of Memories,"I will miss hearing about the lives of the women who wrote the Christmas letters in this book. I felt I had come to know them. The letters were sent to various recipients, which differed from year to year, so the content of each letter was chosen accordingly by its writer. Some items in the letters seemed to be included to remind the writer of experiences she did not want to forget.My only complaint about this Kindle version is that the cover of the book as it appears in my carousel has NO WORDS at all. It has only an off-white linen appearance. Could I re-order this book at no charge and have it delivered to my Kindle with a cover that looks like the one pictured on this web site?"
1,Another one???,"Okay, I am not a Mary Hunt fan. Every year, (more or less), Mary publishes a new book on how to save money or invest wisely, yada, yada, yada...Basically all her books are a rehashing of the same thing. Of course the irony is, that while Mary is supposedly helping you to save money, she is growing richer for every book she sells to the poor saps who buy them. The lesson is, stop spending your hard earned cash on Mary Hunt books. If she really wanted to help you save money, she would give you the information for free, plain and simple. Truth be told, the information isn't all that useful anyway, or else why would she have to publish a new book every year?Mary has yet another book due out in January 2012 and as usual, this one is going to be the one to solve all of your financial woes. Please???? Do yourself a favor folks, jump off the Mary-Go-Round and borrow some books from the library that will be more helpful than Mary ever has, or ever will write."
3,Debt-Proof,"I was already out of debt when I read Mary Hunt's book. I found it to be a good book and things that had already been covered in other books. Some of the same material was covered in Debt-Free Living by Burkett. It was an easy to read book.Taffy Wagner, author of Debt Dilemma"
3,Soil Moisture Tester...,"AAll in all, it functions well... The needle at the ""0"" position on mine, does not go all the way down...Becaeful not to be misled when taking your readings."
2,Not Useful for My Needs,"This Moisture Meter is supposed to give an approximate measurement of how much moisture is retained in the soil. Problem is there has to be a certain amount and depth of soil in the planter for it to read the moisture. It is less than useless for small pots, or delicate plants.I still have it in case I can find a use for it, but....."
3,Flimsy,"The moisture meter seems to report accurate readings as gauged by my fingers. However, the two sensor rods are somewhat flimsy and feel as if they will fall out or break off. I have to straighten them often. I have not yet tried to get a pH reading. Also the rods are shorter than I would like. My previous ancient meter would probe about 3 inches deeper. At least its cheap. I suspect I'll want to downgrade my rating after a few months."
5,A must have DVD for African drumming,This is The One The One! So far the best DVD of African rhythms for djembe and duns produced (until these guys make their next one). See and hear ensemble and individual parts of more common and distinctive pieces to have in your repertoire performed by 3 very accomplished percussionists. Please notice that they smile and have fun playing!
1,Let's Trash Alexander The Great!,"Wow, I get it - you don't like Alexander the Great! According to the author, Alexander was physically ugly, had a repulsive personality, and owed all his battlefield successes to his half-wit sibling. Not quite the same picture of Alexander that history has painted for us. Part of me wonders why anyone would write a book like this (you even had to attack his looks, for goodness sake??!!); another part wonders how these books get published. Reader beware - if you're looking for a good piece of historical fiction featuring Alexander the Great, look elsewhere."
5,Excellent!,"This is the first book of Nicastro's I've read, but it certainly won't be the last. His style is deft, clear and sharply edged, and yet without a hint of dryness .... a wonderful story-teller with that rare ability to bring the historical past alive with a newness and satisfying intimacy one doesn't often find these days. If you think you've heard all there is to hear about Alexander the Great and his world, read this book and be prepared for a fresh and exciting new perspective with more than a few fascinating surprizes. I read it through in practically a single sitting; it was that compelling."
5,Long awaited gem!!!!!!!!,"If you are familiar with Richard Shindell's Somewhere Near Patterson, then you'll love this as it's texturally similiar given the exception of Puente Celeste's efforts. I saw Richard perform a few of these songs live and wondered if perhaps the project would be slightly overproduced like Blue Divide, but no way!!! This is exceptional song craft. I've been following Richard since I was 17, and a decade later, I still find him to be one of the most beloved talents on the contemporary acoustic scene. A couple of these tunes pulled tears out of my eyes just an hour into owning it...It was released this morning...Chuh-ching!Rating items on Amazon should ranged from 1-10 so people can get a clearer idea of the quality. This one I'd surely give a 10."
4,File under...Passengers,"When I worked at my college radio station in the early 80s, someone had taken a magic marker to the Talking Heads' ""Remain in Light"" and had written ""File Under Eno.""Passengers should not be filed under Eno, nor should it be filed under U2. This one-off should be considered a new creation.Yes, it is related to other Eno solo work - ""On Some Faraway Beach,"" Before and After Science, Apollo, etc., etc., etc. - but Bono's vocals on this album add a new element to the Eno mix. Bono isn't singing anthem rock, or even the softer material that he's performed on other U2 albums. His voice works well with the soundscape-like material that predominates on this album.P.S. That Pavarotti guy is a good singer too..."
2,Don't buy from Accessory Export,"I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture. I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic. There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil."
5,Excellent,This is a great teaching tool for novice duplicate bridge students. The authors' sense of humor makes learning the rules so much easier and so much fun to read and learn.
3,Full of good Facts,"This book truely open's our eye's to what has been happening in China The Author does an excellent job of breaking down what goes on inside the Bamboo curtan, it's desire for World Power. The chapters are as follow'sMove over America the Jaw's of the Dragon are openAntiChrist and the Red DragonArmies for ArmaggeddonThe Dragon's Worst NightMare, the soon return of ChristThe Dragon's War on Human rightsThe Dragon and the Myth of the Underground ChurchThe Dragon's war on the ChurchThe Dragon's war on the Chinese BibleThe Chinese Dragon and YouThe Author bieng raised in China is really what I wanted. A person who know's first hand what is Happening.A book a Truth and the Facts"
4,First disc is much better,"This is going to sound like a mildly negative review, but it would truly be hard to slag the first disc on this set. Some of these tunes are high water marks in reggae. I'm a fan of early 70's reggae and late 60's ska. I don't care for watered-down, drum machine (1980's) reggae music. The problem with this collection is that the first disc makes the second one sound weak. Too many songs on the second disc slide into UB40 territory w/out the hooks. And I can only take so much Marcus Garvey talk... it's harder to take the music seriously when you kind of just want to roll your eyes over the worship of this guy (or ANY man).I would suggest looking into his early albums before purchasing this set for full price."
3,"One Fine Disc, Lots of Bad Poetry","Like another reviewer, I greatly prefer Disc One. I prefer ""old school"" reggae, in particular the 70's sound. Earlier stuff is too ska or too derivative of American soul; later stuff is too techno. Just so you can know my perspective, I like Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Toots & the Maytals, Bob Marley. Disc one lives up to that high standard. Disc Two, to my ear, is self-indulgent poetry recitals over dub music. Not offensive, but nothing that makes me want to hear it twice. Disc One would be 4.5 stars, Disc Two is one or two stars. A very important collection, nonetheless."
5,A Superb Thriller,"A very fast-paced action-filled novel with many surprise twists and turns, and with a plot which is all too believable. The writing is crisp and sharp, with a sprinkling of sly good humor throughout. Valentina is in a class of her own, but even marginal characters like Dortmund are individual and alive. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the next Lysander Dalton book to come out."
2,"Old Style, Few Pictures","This is a rather poor book. It resembles an enciclopedia from the 80s. Anyone who has used googleearth will find the pictures pretty boring. The design of the ilustrations is boring, nothing like the good maps natgeo is sending in its recent issues. Actually I wonder if it is just a reprint of old material, refurrnished and actualized with a photo of the hubble space telescope.Dont buy it. I am returning it."
3,Some interesting tidbits.,"This was a fun book to read if you like trading books in general. There are some good points on system selection (almost too much), tax tips and an interesting section on Psychology. The interviews with traders are very general and do not contain any information on strategy of the traders. Had the interviews contained more strategy and less chit chat, this would be an excellent selection. As is however, just so so.."
4,1st Time Reader Makes Discovery: Popcorn!,"Popcorn may not be nourishing but it makes for good munching. Never having read Stuart Woods before I started reading Blood Orchid without much in the way of expectations. I was delighted by what I found: popcorn for my brain. The story is fun and moves the reader right along from first page to last. Right on cue, I cheered for the characters I was supposed to like and hissed the characters I was supposed to dislike. There are implausibilities throughout the story. Some chapters read like outlines of chapters. Many characters are less developed than your average roll of film. So what? This book never pretends to be more than the popcorn it is. If you want a more complex snack try Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder, Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee or Ian Rankin's Inspector John Rebus. After all, one does not live by popcorn alone. Heaven help me, however, if popcorn were to disappear from my diet."
3,Entertaining but not a stellar read,"Holly Barker, police chief of a small Florida town, is there when a new real estate developer in town is shot at by a sniper. Next a really cute FBI guy comes to town and she has a good time with him while shooters to the left and shooters to the right come after them. With the help of her trusty dog, Daisy, Holly goes after the bad guys. The plot is a little loose with a few holes here and there and pretty predictable after no more than half way in. The characters are not particularly well developed, but the ones who should be likable are, and the bad guys are painted with shades of gray instead of in black and white. Overall, it is an entertaining read that is not overly taxing."
4,A Classical Text for the Gandhi Geek,"The prose is concise, the story congenial, the discourse memorable. Gandhi's autobiography will bore the masses, but for truly interested in the mind of the man who defeated an Empire, this book is a must read."
5,Gandhi,Bought as a gift for a friend who is a strong admirer of the autobiography works of interesting personalities who have been a part of human history that depicted strength and courage through the struggles in life to attain the successes of their dreams which has shaped and forever left an impact on humanity. Recommended as a gift for any budding reading enthusiast.
5,One of those books that can profoundly affect you,"I have had misgivings about Gandhi, his thoughts, and his actions. I believe, after I have read this book, that unfortunately, I had a very superficial knowledge about this great person. I still do not agree with many of his policies, do not see him as absolutely infallible, and certainly do not wish to deify him. However, these views have been instilled in me by Gandhi himself as he points out in this marvellous book, that he does not think that he is always correct. He mentions, time and again, that what he says and does, is only his opinion. But he sincerely practices what he preaches, and shares his ideas with all of us in the hope of making the world better. His humility, straight-forwardness, and love of truth touches us all. A truly great man and a very inspiring book."
3,Gandhi review,I thought this book was a little to boring...I thought I liked it....I would recommend this book to Anyone who loves history
5,No Better Seller,"Had no problems. Received before when it was said. Will buy from again. Great for my Mantle, Koufax, DiMaggio and Williams balls. Makes them look Top notch."
5,Classic Heart!,"While this album was not met with critical acclaim, it still ranks as one of my all time favorite Heart albums. I was glad to once again add it to my collection. I think I still have the vinyl!"
5,Raised on Heart,"Bebe Le Strange is one of the albums that made me a more serious musician. Listening to Nancy Wilson on the song ""Raised on you"" raised a few questions in my mind. Who is really the masterminds behind the heart sound? Ann and Nancy truly deliver what I want to hear on a record. ""Silver Wheels"" captivated me the minute I heard it and now that's one of my favorites to play on the guitar. Probably my favorite song off of this record is ""Strange Night"" which is great to listen to on a road trip. ""Sweet Darlin"" is Ann Wilson's voice to the max it's really gorgeous. Please if you are into good music..get this CD."
5,Excellent explanation of the process of how to be a success.,"Only an experienced professional could have done such a great job describing the process it takes to become a flight attendant. I have had this book for 8 years and studied it to the limit. Now that I am 20 yrs old, I now have a chance to fulfill my childhood dreams. One thing though: she forgot to explain how to go about submitting that first letter to get you started. Great Book! If you have any little tips or pull with american airlines, please let me know."
4,Great Product,Great headphones - bought the extra pair so my wife and I both can have quality sound when watching movies.
4,works good,"A number of reviews I read before buying indicated backround noise . I bought them anyway. We only had noise when the volume setting on the TV was low. When the volume level on the TV was normal or high, we detected no noise. Just because the TV speakers are ""off"" does not mean the volume level isn't part of the equation.We would buy them again."
4,As Compared to Her Other Works,"Pauline Gedge is perhaps my favorite author because of her ability to write so well about a time in history veiled in mystery. I have read 4 of her books about Egypt, and I have to say that this is the least well written. As always, she does an exceptional job of describing the scenery and very atmosphere of ancient Egypt, but her fault lies with her characters. Every relationship held by Hatshepset seems shallow, especially that with her true love, Senmut. I felt that the book shouldn't have ended because of the lack of development. A must read, anyway."
3,Mediocre story; don't buy the kindle version,"I'm plodding through this mediocre book, which has become quite tedious. The author tries to give life to the characters, but the story ends up dragging.If you still want to read it, buy the paper copy. The kindle version has the most abysmal editing possible. Periods in the middle of sentences are rampant and distracting, but so are the misspellings, such as Cod instead of God and many, MANY more. It's obvious the text was scanned in and not checked for accuracy. I'm irritated that I paid $10 for such shoddy work. I'm fed up with trying to sift through the punctuation and spelling."
4,good enough,"Not bad for BJJ. not very comfortable, but does not hinder escapes from chokes like others I have tried.. If it had a wider chin strap it would be more comfortable. In the end I usually don't wear anything unless the wife is watching...."
1,Very Disappointed,I never imagined it was going to be 25 lbs for the PAIR... I thought I was getting 2 - 25 lbs dumbbells! This is very deceiving and I am very disappointed.
1,Watch your toes,"I purchased this item for my son a few years ago for Christmas. After a few months, one set broke and if you rotated your wrist too far left or right, the individual weights would fall off onto the ground. They are useless. It's worth it to just purchase regular hand weights if you are so inclined. I would not recommend this product or this brand at all. I knew I was not purchasing top of the line equipment but for $50, I expected a better product."
2,Old Beats,"Armani Exchange (stores) present DJ Frankie Knuckles in this 2003 release which previously and originally was released in England during 2002 by Freetown Records of London. So, these are 2001 - 2002 beats and unfortunately far from contemporary ""house"" sound, which Frankie pioneered during the 1970s. None of the eleven tracks are noteworthy unless you are a superfan of Kerri Chandler. But, the basic problem is that Frankie never arcs the BPMs and so this album monotonously moves from track one to eleven without taking you higher. I guess Frankie Knuckles fans will want this historic memento but house fans should save their money for better albums."
2,What happened?,"Coming off the high and the worlwide acceptance of Yes I Am, I was a bit taked back with this album. It seemed a little fluffy and very overproduced. I just did not feel a connection with her on this one. I did however like a couple of the songs that were hits on the radio, but other than that, I was dissapointed. But even though Melissa may have missed on a couple albums altogether(Breakdown and Your Little Secret, you could never walk away from a Melissa concert without being inspired."
2,Melissa WHO? Get REAL!,"I love Melissa, don't get me wrong, but this album was sour grapes! I could barely get through the first 3 songs. ""I Wanna Come Over"" seems to be the only really good song on this CD. I just happened to like her others better. I'll still listen to this but not as much as her self-titled album or ""Yes I Am."""
4,Excellent,"Are you kidding?! Melissa Etheridge is a phenomenally talented singer and songwriter. This album, like most between her first two and ""Awakening"", is less blues-rock, more soul-rock -- but it's pure emotion and awesome sound!"
4,Very Good Album,"This is a wonderful album from Melissa. I also really enjoyed ""Yes I Am"" and her self-titled effort. All three of these albums are terrific. She really captures the emotions that all the youth (like myself) deal with. She has such passion in her lyrics and vocals. She's just terrific and so many of her songs I can really relate to, such as those dealing with unrequitted love. Lord knows I've had my share of tragedies in my personal life and her songs are a real comfort and, like I said, I can really relate to the lyrics. I could get very emotional about that but I wanted to emphasize it. By the way, she's 100 times better than the overrated, sniveling Alanis Morrissette, who we need less of, not Morr of!"
5,It has paid for itself already!,"It should come with the detector as without it, you will get busted!Use super Velcro and not the double sticky tape if you have more than one helmet."
2,The Chocolate Soldier,"As a fan of the old musicals I was looking forward to this one, but it was hugely disappointing. A tubby Eddie Albert was an unlikely hero, Rise Stevens looked far too old for the romantic female role and the plot is extremely weak, not uncommon in musicals, but the songs and the singers can usually overcome this. Not this time."
5,Excellent slap-stick science-fiction,"I first read this book in the 60's - it struck me as a futuristic ""The Great Escape"". The author may have intended to draw parallels with the numerous WW2 escape stories published in the 50's - such as Cardigan's ""I Walked Alone"". Very funny. I never forgot it - although until locating it now, I'd associated it with Theodore Sturgeon for some reason. I would love to read it again."
2,Quit working after just 12 months!,"This model stinks!! Wish I could give it NO STARS!!!!!My husband and I each have a old Mickey Mouse watch very similar in style and color to this one. It was made by Lorus, and we purchased them back in the late 1980s. They still work great. The only thing is that the bands have discolored and the crystals are somewhat scratched.Fast forward to 2005. I saw these new ones on Amazon (mens and womens), and I was excited. I purchased two - one for each of us. The women's watch is still working OK, but the men's model quit ticking just a few days after one year (warranty = 1 yr), and then to add insult to injury, the second hand fell off! It just fell off!I don't know who makes these watches for Disney, but they are just not worth it! Find another one somewhere else. Or find an old Lorus one that is in good shape."
1,disney watch,I ordered this mens's watch and instead received a womens watch. I was not satified at all. When I contacted the seller I was told that the men's watch was out of stock so instead they sent me a women's watch my grown son would not have appreciated a women's watch I will never order from this vender again
3,WELL,"I thought this was the best reading meter for 10.00 I have seen!! I flushed some plants with 6.0 water.I was shocked and took a reading and it was about right on.I thought this is to good to be true!! Most expensive ones here are not rated any higher then 3 stars,they cost upwards of 100.00 and you need solution to calibrate them.Well the second reading it read well,BUT it bent the probe up like a coat hanger.If they had made the probe stronger they might of had something going here!!"
4,Waiting For The Bio Pic...,"Some biographies would make better films than books. I believe this is one of them. I like her story, she told it well. I just think it would be better told on the screen rather than on the page. Overall I highly recommend it. It comes across just like one of her songs--strong, heartfelt, and vulnerable."
5,Craving more,I loved this book. Enthralling reading and only took two nights to read it. Gave some insight into the meaning of her songs. She was very open about her family life and her marriage to Julie. I only wish she would do a follow-up soon and pick up where this book left off. Including her brave battle with cancer.
3,Melissa is human,Melissa Etheridge revealed her humility and vulnerability in this book. I was disapointed that the book focused so much on her relationships and not more about her music career. This book seems like it was written to please people curious about her personal life. The information about her early years was interesting but I soon grew tired of hearing about one failed romance after the other.
2,"Melissa Fan or Not, an interesting read. FIVE STARS!!!","Being a HUGE Melissa fan myself, it was a given that I would get this the minute it came out. But even aside from that, I loved the book. It gave a very intimate view into Melissa's art and the world of music, and the way she has dealt with the various trials in her life. I admire her greatly, not only for her music, but for her candor and committment. I highly recommend this book! Love you Melissa!"
3,*yawn*,"Not bad,not great. A good read when you need something to kill time (like being out at sea). You can have my copy."
3,an ok book,"She's only human, like the rest of us, but I guess I'm a little disappointed in Melissa. You'd think that someone with her determination and drive would know better than to let people walk all over her like that."
5,"The older I get, the more I like it.","I don't know if I would have liked this album when I was in my 20ies. Now that I am in my 30ies I think this is one of the best albums I own. There is not a lot of music played on the radio that I like anymore, however that is OK. Between Jude Cole and Del Amitri there is still some good music being made. I wish Jude Cole could team up with Mutt Lang. I can only image how good that album would be."
4,JUDE IS THE BEST!,"I MUST ADMIT I AM A ROOTS ROCK 40 SOMETHING GUY...THAT SAID, I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM RECOMMENDINGJUDE TO ANYBODY. HIS SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE SOMEOF HIS BEST. ""SHEILA DON'T REMEMBER"" IS THE BESTSELF-DEPRICATING SONG IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.HIS GUITAR PLAYING IS SOLID AS IS HIS SINGING ANDWRITING. EVERYONE I'VE EVER PLAYED THIS FOR WANTEDA COPY OR MORE OF HIS STUFF. I WISH HE WOULD PLAYCLUBS (HINT) HERE IN THE MIDWEST OR TEAM UP WITH MYFRIEND BILL LLOYD IN NASHVILLE. HEY JUDE! GET OUTOF THE HOUSE AND ROCK! MIKE"
2,Poor Collection but Perhaps I Shouldn't Comment,"I purchased ""I Don't Know Why I Act This Way"" about 3 1/2 years ago, shortly after it was first released. Heard the single ""Believe in You"" on the radio and fell in love with it... (a FANTASTIC song). But the rest of the disc failed to live up to the first cut... I only kept it for a short time (returned it to the music store afterward). I recall eccentric instrumentation/compositions, and sour, mildly offensive lyrics disguised as social critiques (""Hi, my name is Joe. I go to church on Sunday, come home and beat my wife."") Still, those objections came from an ultra-sensitive 18-year-old with undeveloped musical taste. So I could be wrong. Perhaps I'll give Mr. Cole's album another try."
1,Severe Disappointment,"I've been a Jude Cole fan for nearly ten years now. His first album was excellent. Start the Car continued along the same line and satisfied the same musical taste. This album was a MAJOR disappointment. It seems Jude is trying to keep pace with the ""Seattle Grunge"" scene. Jude, ole bud...yeah...I don't know why you act this way either."
3,Love time travel,Good book. I prefertime travel books that go from present to past repeatedly. Other than that I like Deb Stover
1,Terrible,"Ridiculous, pooly written fairy tale. I want reality not some childish dream that bored me to tears. Stay away from this book."
1,Don't bother,"Wow, this was bad. Really, really bad. I couldn't make it past 10%. Cliche, cheezy, ridiculous. Thank goodness I got it for free."
2,"Good Pilates, BORING cardio","I was pretty excited about the promised combination, but the cardio portion could not be duller. The movements are repetitive and dead simple (dull) and not even synchronized to the inappropriate music. I wish someone would get this right."
1,This album is terrible...,"I bought this album based on a recommendation from a friend. It is unlistenable.I dont understand the 5 stars given for the album. What have these people heard? All I heard are monotonous background noises you hear from some TV commercial (i.e. the Dodge truck commercial where each truck is picking up sands from an hourglass - check it out). In some tracks you'll hear voices, not singing but conversing.It seems that there must be some sort of hidden subliminal message. Maybe a few beers might help me hear any. I could have given it ZERO star but Amazon requires a minimum of 1.If you are buying this album looking for a beat go look elsewhere like Juno Reactor or TCM. This one will definitely be traded as a used CD in a local music store nearby."
4,Plateau (track 2) is a masterpiece,"Plateau (track 2) is modern music at its most subtle and evocative, where a gentle bubbling rhythm is overlaid with busy activity. This track is a serene but chaotic scene from the rainforest, and must be one of the best Orb tracks. Really grows on you, ideal for a warm evening on a Mediterranean rooftop."
3,Nice performance....but!!,"Have had these for a couple of years now. Work as well as described by others. Problem is whenever I have to go behind the TV, the slightest contact with the front speakers (on stands) causes them to topple over. This had happend several times and now the base of the speakers themselves have separated from the rest of the box. Otherwise ****"
4,What else do you want?,I 've done a lot of web research before ordering this one. This is priced very good and plays well. It has crystal clear music and can handle upto 10 db without making any kind of distortion. The bass is good but i guess its little too much for music i hear. I am satisfied and cant ask more.
1,Misleading description,"Not a stainless steel watch. It's plastic. It's also available from La Crosse on Amazon for 42% less. Don't buy it. No back light, no specs on water resistance."
5,This CD is the Shxt!,This CD is the best any juggalo should get it 'cause it's the shxt! Even if you dont like ICP get this CD Shaggy 2 Dope is the best!
5,The perfect Box Extender,"I have tile on my kitchen walls, and all of the recepticals were loose, so I hired a handy man to fix them, he could not. I hired an electrician, but he did not fix them either. I googled for a solution and I purchased box extenders from another company, and they were useless, so I was a sceptic. The box extenders I purchased from Ace Hardeware were actually functional, and worked perfectly. Finally the job is complete!"
5,One of a kind Mr Men book,"I don't know why but this book is different than the rest. It's not that is bad or such but the way Mr. Hargreaves approaches the story of Mr. Small.Mr. Small is the smallest person you've ever seen, or perhaps the smallest person you've never seen! Mr. Small goes to Mr. Robinson so he can find a job. After help from the mailman who rings the door for Mr. Small, he goes on a series of job failures until.... We find Mr. Small's job is actually being the subject of Roger Hargreaves story, MR. SMALL!"
2,Not what is pictured,"The photo shows all stainless. Two aluminum frying pans with non-stick coating were in the box instead of the heavy stainless pan. This in not what I wanted to order, as I already have a worn out set with peeling non-stick coating. I wanted all stainless with laminated bottoms, and not the cheap non-stick coating."
5,exactly what you need in your kitchen,"I needed new pots after getting my first ceramic top electric range (the pans need to sit flat if you want to cook on this kind of range). I am so pleased with my wearever pans. My set is the same as this but my utensils are not metal and I also got a small colander. I've been impressed with how easy they are to cook with, clean, pour from. I've never had such nice pans. I purchased several other brands - would get the big box home, unpack it, and ask myself why I was paying so much for cookware - and return them. I anticipate these pans will last me a long, long time and I'm happy with them. I did not buy them on Amazon - only because they were not available in stock with super save shipping."
3,Love and hate at the same time!,"I order this set because I wanted stainless steel cooking surface including the frying pan. I also like the fact that the lid can be used to drain contents in the pot. When I got the set it was not the one advertised, the frying pans had non-stick surfaces. They had obviously realized this after I received them, because of the new posting they had place on this items page. I just didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them. so I kept them. Just to let you know the lids do not fit the frying pan. They work fine and look nice and are quality made for the price."
4,TRUE GRIT,True Grit re-visited. The major difference between the two movies is that Glen Campbell's (sounding more like Teddy Roosevelt and only in the film for greater box office receipts) was greatly improved by Matt Damon and Barry Peppers brought more dimension to the character than Robert Duvall (Who is one of the greatest actors of his generation)but his presence wasn't as gritty as Peppers and as believable for the period.
1,"Not a BAD movie, but not good:","I've seen so many westerns for so long now and the original ""True Grit"" is one of my favourites.I saw this re-make at a supermax, giant screen theatre and went into it with no preconceived notions.I did like the young girl's part taken on by Halie. She was very good for an actress that young.But Matt was typical Matt and seemed to be miscast.As for Bridges part of Rooster, well, too bad he was so different from the original character. Could not understand most of his slurred dialog. His performance seemed flat and uninspired.Just not as great a movie as it was advertised to be. Sorry but i gave it one star and would not recommend it."
1,IT WASN'T THAT......,"Well yes it was that BAD. All i have to say is that Jeff Bridges who plays as the marshal, is that i couldn't understand a damn word he was saying. I can not stand a movie where the main actor mumbles soo much it makes the movie unbearble to watch. This movie would make JOHN WAYNE roll over in his grave. Plus the DVD version of this movie has a bad glicth in it."
3,Just OK.,"The actors did a good job at their roles. The scenery was good. But the story??? I picked up a few areas that I guess should have caused me to laugh, but they missed the mark. I was busy trying to make out if this was a comedy or a drama. Some scenes did not make sense, but I guess if they were cut out this would have been a VERY short movie. Maybe that would have been better. Judge for yourself... rent it or borrow it before you decide if it is worthy of your collection. I will not be adding this one to my collection."
5,Better than the original,"Jeff Bridges makes for a much more believable Rooster Cogburn character than John Wayne. He really played the part well, and I enjoyed this version so much more, it's more believable, and not everyone looks like they just took a shower before the scene like in the Wayne movies . . . they were out on the trail for days and sleeping on the ground. I expect a lot of historical accuracy in movies now, and this was a very well done film."
1,"Truely boring, not a real western!!!","I love western movies, but this truly had to be the most cheezy, boring,and dull remake of a classic I've ever seen. Here are many more problems with this movie below:1. The little girl is way too anoying that throughout the first 10 minutes you wished she would leave the screen. Instead she's the main character, so your stuck with a whinning little brat the whole wasted time watching.2. Hardly any gunfights and the small few are poorly played out as if your watching Little House On The Prairy.3. Extremely boring, with no suspence,the main bad guy seems to be too nice and fake, real crappy acting.4. This movie should've been rated G and can easily be understood by 3 year olds."
1,Excrutiating,"This film did not live up to the hype at all. It doesn't deserve the acclaim it's received, for some of the same reasons that someone else has already laid out.1. Boring as hell. Talk, talk, talk, dragged out scenes, this is just DULL.2. The lead, Hailee Steinfeld, got on my nerves in the first five to ten minutes. Her ridiculously proper speech and bratty demeanor are so grating that anytime she was in a wee spot of danger, I was actually hoping something so un-Hollywood would happen and she would bite the dust. No such luck.3. The Coens just dragged it out too long. I'm a big fan of their work, but not this turkey. Their storytelling on this one is so scattered. I couldn't wait for it to end.An annoying lead, an incomprehensible, overbearing Jeff Bridges, and a long, boring story, what could be worse?"
1,Boring,"I don't see the hype in this movie at all.... I thought it was a yawner, very slow moving, boring... I had to turn it off... several times. Bridges talks like he has dirty socks in his mouth so you hardly understand what he is saying, the acting throughout was dull, scenery was nice, taht's about it. Waste of money."
3,Fake Grit,"I still prefer the original and if they would have at least stuck with the original script I could have been happy with the remake of an American classic.They did keep some of the high points from the original film, but put in their own twists and ideas. This movie could have stood on its own without having to use a great film as its supporting advertisement. I guess I'm saying that even with the great cast they didn't make it a better story and in my opinion they took away its greatness by changing it so much.I do recommend watching it but don't be fooled by the title; this is not the True Grit we all remember."
2,Boring,This movie was boring and difficult to sit through. Not alot of content and difficult to understand parts of the movie. Skip this one!
4,good movie,"Not as good as the original. But I do like a few things that they changed, esp. the ending. It tied up loose ends to the storyline."
3,Average,"The acting was all very good, but I found the action lacking. I guess maybe the previews I saw of this movie raised my expectations too high. Oh yeah, some of the story just took too long to develop."
2,Did not like it!!!,"This movie BLOWS, I think Bridges was on Crack the whole intire movie!!! Did anyone unstand what he said?? See, i never watched the old one with John Wayn, and if I did, this one would have REALLY sucked, would of gave it only 1 star!!! A few of his movies i like, Starman was one of them .. his newer movies stink, he is burnt out,, i have to say i liked Tron the 1st one, the second one, he came into it with a bit of a Laboskie attitude, and he was Burnt out!!! Bridges is Too Burnt out in my Book to even think about trying another fast paced Movie, he should stick to his burnt out Drama type figure, He acually slowed it dowwwwwnnnnnn!!!!!"
4,Definitely Worth Watching,"I have not seen the original movie, so I can't compare it. However, Coen brothers version is well made, including the cast, the script, and the cinematography. The only problem is that it is hard to understand actors' speech, but we turned the subtitles on, and that fixed the problem.It is an interesting story, entertaining movie. Thumbs up!"
3,"A very odd, Coenish western","If the Coen Brothers created ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" to put a soundtrack to film, it appears they created this movie as a venue to teach proper diction, clarity of speech and, to some degree, manners. I'm still not sure whether this was a drama, a dark comedy or a parody on the western genre and school grammar lessons. (And now I find myself researching diction: which is proper or preferred usage, ""parody of"" or ""parody on""? I find both. What would Mattie say?) I know I found myself chuckling through a good part of it, if only because I didn't know how else to respond. All in all, it was something of a well acted playful romp."
3,Not terrible,"First, I never saw the original so I am not comparing it to anything. Standing alone, the movie is just o.k. The story is slow and the dialogue is rather strained. I like Jeff Bridges, though, so it wasn't a total bust.Not bad but not recommended."
4,True Grit,This western movie was a nice piece of cinema that portrayed the tenacity of a young girl to get justice for her father's untimely death by the hands of an outlaw and get back what rightfully belong to her family.
3,Ok remake,"overall pretty decent acting but the original was more entertaining than this re-make, the twist at the end was new but I didn't think added anything."
1,Can't Say I'm Impressed.,"After going to one of their concerts at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA, I gotta say I'm not impressed with this group. What they lack in talent, they do not make up in novelty. All their songs lack melodies and tunes. I found myself unable to tell the difference between song #1 , song #2 or song # 15. They all sounded remarkably similar and monotonous to me. I fear you must have to have very unique preferences to have an affinity for this group, because I highly doubt the average listener will find themselves dancing or singing along to any of their so-called music. There's a difference between diverging from mainstream music, and just producing noise."
1,"Cool Concept, Useless Design","Don't waste you money. There is NO WAY a two-year old can get this toy to work. The book pages are so thick (great durability though!) that you can't press the bee ""pen"" hard enough to touch the buttons on the main part of the pad to get the desired outcome. I can't even get it to work as a thirty-year-old adult. It is beyond frustrating for parent and child, disappointing product from a usually great company."
5,A Must Buy for Anyone Complaining of Being Stiff,The DVD is great and I recommend it highly. I have fibromyalgia and this is perfect for getting those muscles stretched and warmed up without causing further pain. Definitely worth 5 stars.
5,Dinosaur Babies (Step-into-reading: A Step 2 Book),The book appears to be excellent for the beginning reader. The subject matter should hold interest well and the illustrations are excellent!
2,"10 For Content, 2 for Despicable Pricing","I own the 1974 five-volume set, and I am quite sure that this new six-volume set is priceless in terms of content and organization. A week does not go by but that I refer to both this set, and the Syntopicon volume of the Great Books.The pricing, however, is despicable. It costs one penny a page to produce a book. This set should be on sale in hard-copy to libraries for $250 and in soft-copy to individuals for $190.This kind of unjustified pricing is killing education and reflection, one reason why I am starting to offer all of my books free online, and encouraging Amazon to bypass publishers entirely. This book could and should be available as a digital file that can be sent to the FedExKinko's nearest the buyer, and produced locally.Publishers are going to get killed by Google, or by Amazon, in part because this kind of pricing is their death song."
3,Marianne Goes Mellow,"A little too mellow I must say. I liked 'She' a lot, and I loved the story plot behind the song. I liked 'Flaming September' as well, but the best song had to be 'Bored By Dreams'. This is an easy going album by rock's fairy tale princess, Marianne Faithfull. It's not bad at all, just very mellow."
5,Love it!,My family got hooked on the Doodlebops first with my son back in 2005. Now my daughter is in love with them. The DVD's are so fun and entertaining to watch. WARNING: All of the songs will get stuck in your head :)
2,For beginners to working out in general,This DVD was simply an overview to Pilates it would have been better if there was an extended workout included or different people doing intermediate and difficult. The pausing in between moves to explain the positions was helpful but it just broke up the workout so you finish feeling you have had the easiest workout ever...i guess it is better then sitting on the sofa! i would reccommend Denise Austin's Power Yoga
1,"Great title, but lousy content.",This is what this book is about: This guy wants all moms to stay home with their kids full time. Please don't buy this book if you're trying to find quality child care for your preschool age children. He has no solutions for mothers who have to work outside the home in order to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.
4,works well,"I only used it once before winter came, but it did the job just as I wanted it to. However, I gave up trying to fold it up and just stored it open."
3,Great Idea But....,"Not too much to say about the product. It was a little difficult to assemble. Could have used a third hand. I have used it quite a lot. It torn immediately in several places. I duct taped all places that ripped and it is still going strong. It will carry a heavy load and is good to use when a full size wheelbarrow is too cumbersome. I am a small person and am able to haul heavy loads up outdoor stairs. I would recommend it, just be aware it has some quality flaws."
2,Too small to be useful,The cargo bay is too small to actually be useful. Might be good for hauling firewood. But for leaves the small capacity would make leaf raking take forever!
2,Dissapointment,I am Alan Jackson's biggest fan and I never thought that I would ever buy an AJ CD that I didn't like. Like Red On A Rose is a huge dissapointment for me from beginning to end. If I had listened to the songs first I would not have bought this CD.
5,Amazing country,"I have to say this is different than some of his older material, but this in no way lessens it. My two favorite tracks are ""Good imitation of the blues"" which is definitely NOT a twangy country song, but honest and I felt it deeply. The other one is the Firefly's Song, which blew me away. I really recommend this cd to anyone - even people who generally don't go wild about country music. You won't regret it."
1,Wish I could return it,Rushed right out and bought it the first day because I love Alan's stuff. I wish I could return it!!!!!! Nothing country on here. It's all mellow enough pop you could use it to help you go to sleep. I like Trace Adkins new album Dangerous man a LOT more than this new one from Alan. Sorry Alan - we've all gone country - you should come back!
1,Bad,"I am one of Alan's biggest fans, but this new CD disappoints me. AJ, please go back to making traditional country music. Take a lesson from George Srait. Keep it real."
3,Mature Music,"I have been a long time fan of Alan Jackson and whilst this was not what I expected, I found it be a mature grown up album.So if youre looking for country look elsewhere, if yuo are looking for adult music like Vince Gill's wonderful These days, this might be for you."
1,What is all the hype about?,"I LOVE Muse, Supergrass, Rialto, Radiohead, Doves, Mansun, Elbow, Beatles, etc. In fact these are my favorite bands. So when I found Pulp I expected it to be something I would like to, it having such a shared fan-base.This was not at all the case! As far as I'm concerned, every single song on this albumb is FILLER. There are no catchy tunes, the singer's voice is wierd, and the vocals are overplayed."
4,Brilliant satiric britpop,"If you can get hold of the box set of Different Class, do it! The other CD in the box Second Class is even better than the main CD.And this IS good stuff. The happy way in which Pulp sings about tragic comic situations of everyday life makes you join in singing, but it also makes you think. After all, life's worth living.For a long time, I used a part of the track Ansaphone on my ansaphone."
5,An Album You Must Have.....,"I like this band a lot. I bought this album 3 years ago and I keep listening over and over. Especially Disco 2000 and Something Changed. Although the rest of the songs are great too. The point is, this is the best album I've ever had."
1,Worthless,Plugged the unit in at an outlet above the kitchen counter because the thought of mice where I prepared meals completely grossed me out. A few days later I saw a mouse on top of the stove not four feet away. Save your money.
1,This Item Does not Work,"I puchased two of these hoping for a humane solution to a recent mouse problem. I would say that the mice laughed and continued eating. If you want results, spend your money on traps. If you want to watch mice laugh, this is the product for you."
4,"Do the job, good price","These are cheaper than some other brands and still do their job. They seem to be a bit louder than more expensive filters, but I can deal with slightly more noise if it means only having to spend a third as much money."
1,QQ,"They ship to Israel, but not to Hawaii?!Also, this is listed at a 6-pack; it's actually a 4-pack.Try Filtersfast.com"
1,Dumb movie,One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. The jokes were lame and the plot nonsensical. What a waste of time. It's pretty sad since I know the Wayan's are capable of so much more. Save yourself a couple hours and skip this one.
3,MOVIE,FUNNY STUPID MOVIE THAT I HAD ON VHS. SINCE VHS IS NO LONGER THEN I HAD LOST A GOOD MOVIE UNTIL I LOCATED IT ON AMAZON.
2,If this film was a beer it would be Wayans Lite,"Wayans usually means funny, and there were some funny scenes in this film, but overall it was a weak film."
4,HOOD naked truth,"A simply lovely satire on Afro-American wellbeing, saturated with underage sex performed by well-grown adult actors.Also some moments of a scriptwriter-of-Jewish-American-background-Afro-American humour were too much to bear, it's, probably,supposed disclosing a naked reality ""hood"" life goes on.It is a good work both to relax and laugh at."
2,Annoying,"Rachel Farris has one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard. She says in her ""bio"" that originally held out on a record deal because she felt producers were making her ""bubblegum"" and ""fake."" She wants to be considered in the ""ROCK"" category.Rachel Farris should've held out longer because the only thing she accomplished was exactly what she was trying to avoid -""bubblegum"" AND ""fake.""She does not compare to a Michelle Branch because Michelle can actually play guitar and has a better voice (not annoying). I don't think Michelle Branch has a big rock feel to her, but she comes far closer than Rachel Farris. Rachel is just a dark haired Britney Spears who often sounds ""flat"" on her demo which was annoyingly placed on my movie theatre cup."
3,Fun Pop Album,"""Soak"" is a mixture of slow, thoughtful ballads and quick, upbeat pop/rock songs. There are a few tracks on the CD that I've found myself consistently skipping, but overall it's a good first album. Rachel has a beautiful childlike voice (although sometimes too childlike). If you're in the mood for something fun and pop, pick it up."
2,Certainly NOT a complete guide,"I have learned a few things (very few) from this book, but on the whole wish I had found a different book. Like many of these how-to-do it books that purport to be a compendium of everything there are chapters included with little valuable information. It's as though the editor said, ""You've got to have a chapter on plums."", so the author includes one that has some general facts but no specific information that would make the reader either run out and buy plums enthusiastically or avoid them entirely. Obviously the author has no knowledge of figs, which are not included. Nut trees are also absent. So the subtitle misrepresents the book."
4,"Good book, no citrus tree information though","Lots of good information, but I was disappointed that there is not any information about citrus trees."
3,Orchard Book,It could have had a lot more and better illustrations Kinda disappointed with it. But it was not guanteed. OH
4,Buy it only for Freddie,"Who cares who invented vocalese? Hendricks is the master. The rendition of Freddie Freeloader (lifted off Miles Davis' classic) is worth the price of the album alone. No one (I repeat no one) can pull off the pyrotechnics required to vocalese on a Coltrane-Cannonball collaboration!!! Astonishing!!!Four stars because Boppin at the Blue Note is soooooo much better with bouncing, inventive buddies in a live setting (rather than a studio setting here). I find most of Jon Hendricks & Friends is OK (which means of course miles ahead what anybody else can do :-)"
5,THE BEST...LELE SACCHI'S DISK 2 IS BAD A$$...,"i am an avid bargrooves fan...they are all good. its always the hottest lounge/dance/electronica period. ben stowan is the man and he always lays down the hot wax...what got me on this set terrazza was the second cd...i dont know how people are not diggin on this cat lele sacchi, he is nice...the second disk is a whole other feel then the first more dance/electronic versus ben's laid back disc one...bargrooves is a sure thing never disapoints"
4,Supernaturally natural,"Wayne has came back after a lack of creativity. This CD definately is better than the previously released and monotone ""The Way Home"" and ranks with the on fire ""Field of Souls"" and the honest ""The Fine Line"" as one of his greatest CD's."
3,would be better on video tape,"I'm sure these exercises have been proven over the test of time in the New York City Ballet, but I did the exercises once and returned to the gym for a more intense workout. It's too distracting to try to figure out the pictures and flip back and forth from the workout listings. I wouldn't recommend this book if you workout to blow off stress."
4,"A lot of filler, but a good workout nonetheless","The first 66 pages are pictures of dancers and information about the New York City Ballet. The pages that include the actual workout have a lot of empty space and photos that don't pertain to the specific workout. If you are interested in ballet and dance photography, this is a nice bonus to a good workout.The workout itself is simple, but challenging. It is helpful to have had a ballet background, so you now how to do the moves without just flopping your limbs around. If you don't know how to use resistance and move your body in slow, controlled movements, this workout will be too easy and not effective."
5,Another awesome PJ Funnybunny book,"I love reading PJ FunnyBunny books to my niece. Her and I literally can not get enough of them. This is her favorite books of the series. It was a pretty cute, playful story. A must have!"
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would","All of the other negative reviews do a good job of describing what is wrong with this book. The vaguely cute illustrations are not sufficient to outweigh its negative messages about teasing and how to respond to it. This does not live up to the Dr. Seuss imprint. It is true that one COULD use this book as a way to broach the subject of teasing, but it seems like there are better ways to do it. I warn any potential buyers to preview the book before giving it as a gift. We are throwing away our copy."
3,inadequate size guide...,"size guide should be made more obvious for those who don't buy tights every day. i'm a pants size 0-2, but i think had i bought B/C instead of A/B it would've been a better fit for me"
5,Vietnam In HD,This is by far one of the best documentaries I have viewed in regards to the Vietnam War. My War History students loved it!
4,From the Soldier's Point of View,"This was a great film. Each battle for each now long forgotten little hill was described in brutal detail. The combination of color film and surround sound made the viewing experience fantastic. Many of the stories were heart wrenching, and one can understand what the individual soldiers went through at that time. The now out of print documentary VHS ""Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War"" was my first exposure to the war in the form of a documentary (released in 1980). that documentary went into great detail by interviewing CIA agents, generals, and politicians involved in the war. It looked at the country of Vietnam from post WWII to its bitter end in 1975. In this documentary, the story of the foot soldier is told--in high definition color."
4,Witness,"The personal accounts of the Vietnam Vets are second to none. As one who fought in A Shau in '68 I marveled then modeled the fighting attitude of protecting their brothers from courageous battles to clearing a LZ. The insane policy of taking a hill then leaving hurt morale let alone the deaths and casualties. My criticism of this documentary was the way it handled the impetus to the actual invasion: Bay of Tonkin. It was rigged from the get go. My lasting impression was how drafted young men would sacrifice, fight, and die half a world away will live with me for the rest of my life. Hopefully Americans will too."
1,Derivative and Poorly Written,"This book was a disappointing read. At 185 pages The Everyday Witch is at least not very long, but I barely finished the dreary thing. The plot and world Forrester has created are familiar and feel rehashed--every turn of the page I kept thinking I would see the words ""Harry Potter"" or ""Ron Weasley"" instead of ""Beatrice"" or ""Cyrus."" The characters are perhaps the worst element of the story; I have rarely encountered such two-dimensional or unrealistic people in a novel. The prose certainly gives them a run for their money, though...clunky and immature, it rings of inexperience. The author has clearly not established a voice yet, which lends the book a timid, weak quality. The Everyday Witch is a perfect example of low-caliber fantasy, the type I loathe and hope to ease others away from."
4,"""Real Me"" is a great spiritual journey guide","An excellent guide to opening communications, starting with yourself and working outward. The result - spiritual satisfaction. Very readable!"
3,no SACD and has issues with some DVD-audio discs,I have been a loyal HK customer for years now. but i am a little let down in this device. i have the new NIN Downward Spiral DVD-audio disc and it has trouble playing. i took the disc to a friends and put it in his pioneer and it worked perfectly. i cant seem to get an answer out of hk as to weather this is just my unit or all of them.
2,Audio syncing problems,"I was disappointed to find two major flaws in this DVD player -- the first, its failure to provide a digital DVD-Audio signal, is unfortunate but not unforgivable. The analog outs, which require pausing the music and switching to a different input on the remote whenever you want to listen to anything, sound fine.The bigger problem is the unit's inability to maintain proper syncing of audio with video. When you spend this much on a quality H/K player, you expect WAY more. It's a simple, essential function. But I'd say about 33% of the time, I pause the player at any point in the disc, resume play, and the audio either lags or jumps ahead of the video. I'm forced to pause and unpause until the sound syncs.Due to these problems, I'm not even going to go into picture and sound quality...I can't get past the two issues mentioned above."
2,Give me a break,"This guy gets a bigger kick out of seeing himself that he does about really reporting news and events accurately. He is nothing more than the Rush Limbaugh of the left ... just more obnoxious.I you dislike Republicans or white males, you will love this book."
1,This guy is confused,"Why does he write from emotion rather than fact. The fact is, he doesn't know anything."
3,Moore Should Stick to Filmmaking,"As a writer, Moore makes a very good filmmaker. While there are certainly some good points and humorous moments in this book, I found it largely to fall flat. I acknowledge that this is his first book attempt, but I would suggest reading The Winner Take All Society, Race to the Bottom or something by Krugman, if you're really interested in looking at socioeconomic problems in this country."
4,Read this and your not want to work hard again!!!,"Very few words as this is a book that everyone should read no matter where you live in the world. Take note! Its happening everywhere and you could be next!!!!Michael, please do a book about the us Brits please!!!!"
1,"Sparks and Heat, but little Illumination","I don't disagree with a lot of Moore's politics, but I find his smug and sometimes not entirely honest methods of satire to be a bit unpleasant. It's easy to preach to the choir, especially if your sermon is mostly hot air and cheap moralizing. You can read the bumper stickers at any expensive private college and skip reading this silly book. (A would-be parlor radical friend of mine gave me a copy, which I tossed into the trash after a quick reading.) My advice: Hie thee to the library and read C. Vann Woodward and learn some appreciation for the complexity of American society and politics."
5,Good Bowl,"I've tried a lot of the various mealtime bowls and plates for my toddler. I really like this bowl as it doesn't move around much and is very sturdy and it is also big enough to use for soup or cereal w/milk. My only complaint, which goes true for most of the brands, is that you are not supposed to put it in the microwave. Other than that, it is so far the best bowl I've tried for the baby."
5,Compulsory for LFN fans,"It is the music from LFN. It is the mood, the feel, the flavour. it will take you into the darkened corridors of Section 1. It will take you on missions into labs. It will take you into the bath with Michael and Nikita. Sit back and immerse yourself."
4,Pros and Cons,"This hood comes with the 100-400, so don't buy it separately.Pros:- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element.- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.Cons:- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile."
4,Sappy Love Story with a Predictable Ending,"In the opening chapter of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, the reader meets Katie. A woman whose boyfriend has just broken up with her and she has no idea why. She finds a package on her doorstep. The package is the diary of her boyfriend's former wife to their son, Nicholas. Do I have to say anymore? From this point in the book I knew the ending to a tee.Although predictable, I did enjoy the story. The diary was a little sappy because everything was just perfect. Perfect life, perfect family, perfect love.If you are a hopeless, sappy romantic I think you will absolutely love this story."
2,Ho Hum,"This story was a totally predictable tear-jerker written with very little subtlety and even less character development. I was really looking forward to reading this book and felt truly let down after going through page after page of a very average storyline draped in a mother's sentamental gushings over her new-born child.Most of the characters were never really defined through anyone else's eyes save those of the diary's author, and the character of the diary's recipient was not developed at all.I really felt like this story was a barely disguished melding of Segal's ""Love Story"" and Sparks' ""Message in a Bottle."""
5,Excellent,"After reading some of James Patterson's books I was hooked on his writing. But this book took a very different approach to his writing. Each time I picked it up to read it, I did not want to put it down. It was excellent from the first page to the last page. It was a story that was happy and sad. I really enjoyed the book and I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes Mr. Patterson's books."
1,Sappy,This is one of the worst books I've ever read. Patterson should stick w/ the horror genre. His attempt at romantic drama is sappy and insipid.
1,Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas- YUCK,"I have never written a review for a book,but I felt compelled to for this book. I love James Patterson's thrillers,but this attempt at another venue failed miserably. This was so sugar coated that my teeth hurt. The characters are so shallow and blissfully stupid. I was very glad it was a quick read. Please stick to thrillers next time."
2,Dreadful,"I really, really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it just didn't ever click into place. I think the main problem was that I didn't like any of the characters: not pathetic, melodramatic, ""why me?"" Katie, not super-great-guy Matt, and definitely not self-absorbed Suzanne. I didn't even like the completely unrealistic baby Nicholas.Aside from that, the book moved along at a good pace. I read it in one sitting and the writing was engaging, smooth, and clear, if a bit over-the-top in places. The ending was utterly predictable and the denouement abrupt, leaving me with a vague feeling that the entire preceding drama had no point.If you're looking for a quick summer read, or a cheap tear-jerker, this is the place to look -- although the two-dimensional characters might not tug your heartstrings hard enough to draw tears."
1,Say Cheese,"I'm a fan of James Patterson's work, for the most part, but I must ask - what was he thinking?First off, the book is so light in material and wordcount that it took me just over an hour to read it. 2-3 page chapters may work well in the mystery/suspense genre, but not in a book like this. It's apparently supposed to be romance, but the dialogue was so cheesy and the chapters so short that it lost my interest almost immediately.Stick to writing good suspense novels and murder mysteries, and leave the tacky romance novels to Judith Krantz."
1,Don't bother -- read the real Patterson in his earlier books,"James Patterson should stick to what he knows best. The glaring problems with timelines and logic in this story are too many to list. One example -- Suzanne met a boyfriend at the 1996 wedding of John Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette, is with him for four years but has a new husband (not the boyfriend) and a year-old baby when the defining event of the book happens in 1999 -- three years into her 4-year relationship with the earlier boyfriend. In another instance, we meet Kate as she finishes the diary and is pondering whether she can forgive her boyfriend but when we come back to that at the end of the book, there appears to be none of this questioning about returning to him. Even without these annoying and distracting oversights, the plot is unbelieveable, trite and simplistic."
2,Pass the Insulin!,"Diabetics everywhere, beware! You will need to adjust your insulin dose to deal with all the sweetness in this book! Call me cynical, but I think Patterson and his fans would be far better served if he stuck to the thriller genre. I am a mother who adores her sons; I have also been in love with a marvelous man. But this too, too idyllic and too, too tragic tale with its thoroughly predictable ending is just too, too much. It is sort of like trying to make a meal off cotton candy--pleasant on the tongue, but absolutely no substance to satisfy. Cloying at best; a minor waste of reading time at worst."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one!,"My book club picked this book. What a waste of time! We all hated it! Why on earth would you have a book with the main character dating 2 men named Matt? Unbelievable, predictable and boring. What was the purpose of the name dropping throughout the book? For example, Katie went to JFK Jr's wedding, or listing the book titles that a character owns. Was Patterson trying to make us believe that this was a true story? Any reader who is older than 12 will know from page 1 that this book is a weak example of fiction."
1,Would not recommend for anyone who is a serious reader,"Every part of this book is contrived, I did not feel any sympathy for any of the characters at all.Not even a good romance here. Would not have read past the first page if not reading for a book group. We may get 2-3 minutes worth of discussion our of this book, if that!"
1,Cheeseball Trash,"This book must have been the worst novel I have ever read. The writing is repetitive without reason and trite to begin with. How much does the author get paid for every ""Isn't it lucky"" that appears? And who even says that? Eww.The characters were entirely unrealistic and ironically plain at the same time. The plot (if you even count it as a plot) has absolutely no point to it... This was a bomb of a venture for James Patterson. The prose is banal, cheesy, and without any depth. This book was a complete waste of my money, time, and energy. You couldn't pay me to read it again."
2,A Willing Suspension of Disbelief?,I was excited about reading the book - saw it was a NY Times Bestseller. But I was disappointed. Very formulaic. And I had to suspend my disbelief in the most extreme way to enjoy reading the book. It reads very quickly anyway! I guess Mr. Patterson should stick to what he does best - mystery suspense.
1,"A quick read, but you'll never get that time back","If you hated The Bridges of Madison County, you'll hate Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. This book is a quick read and a page-turner, but it gives you nothing of substance. The characters are wholly unbelievable -- about six months after a tragedy involving one ""love of his life"" a man does NOT move on to another ""love of his life."" This book is written by an advertising professional for a specific, targeted market. Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas has references to a variety of music, products and brand names that might make you identify with the book's characters. It refers positively to The Bridges of Madison County, so if you thought that book had something worthwhile to say, you might feel the same way about this book. If, however, you'd rather nourish your mind when you read, then skip this one."
1,TOO CONTRIVED!!,I had high hopes for the book as the jacket said it was a best seller. Boy was I wrong! I felt the story was too contrived and that the author was forcing me to feel the pain Katie was going through. The character's lines were so bad I felt like it was torture for me. I normally get weepy over beautiful love stories but this time it was like Patterson was forcing me to cry. I found myself skipping a few pages since I was bored out of my mind. I read this in the plane and was done in less than 2 hours. I'm sure Patterson's other works are good but this one was really bad. It's so bad that I am embarassed to have the book lying in my room. Read it and see if you'll agree with me!
5,Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas,"Katie Wilkinson is left by her boyfriend, Matt. Katie cannot figure out why he left. She thought they were happy together. However, Matt gives Katie a diary that was written by his first wife, belonging to his son, Nicholas.As Katie turns the pages of this diary, she soon becomes involved with Suzanne's emotions and becomes seemingly more aware of Matt's personality. This book will have you laughing and crying, and as you learn the meaning behind this book, it will be one that you will not ever forget. This book has love and passion, and will make any mother cry. It is a true romance."
2,Way to perfect,"I got very sick of the perfect family of Suzanne and Nicholas, no one loves their life that much. It was a cute love story but everything worked out a little to well. There wasn't enough twist and turns for my taste. Also it is hard enough to find one soul mate let alone two soul mates in a life time ."
5,Loved it,"All Mothers...and fathers should read this book. I couldn't put it down. I finished it in one day. It was so moving, as a new parent it really hit me hard. This is a loving book. It's a big jump from the usual James Patterson thrillers. I couldn't believe it was the same author, but it was written so beautiful.I bought this for friends, my mother n law, and other relatives. They all loved it as well."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"Sappy, totally predictable, unrealistic, totally lacking the the true emotion of the story. The best part of the book was that it took less than two hours to read. There are very few male writers that can write from a woman's perspective. Wally Lamb is one, James Patterson isn't."
3,A good way to pass the time,"While I wouldn't stow this book next to my copies of Oscar Wilde or Hemingway, James Patterson lives up to his capability of producing one page-turner after another. Like a previous reader, I bought the book at the airport in San Diego and had it finished halfway to Denver. An engaging story that reminds us that memories should be cherished while life should continue to be relished, I'd recommend it to a friend."
1,I want my money back......,"I wish I had read the reviews before I picked up this stinker. I would like the author's address so I can return it to him. One book-like new-only thrown once. This was so contrived. I didn't like the way the author took such shortcuts to set a mood or describe a scene. He mentions a certain song or singer and you, the reader, are to do the work of imagining an image. The author name drops too much to save him the work of writing what he's trying to get me to see. He has no idea of how women really are. I'm usually a pretty good speed reader, but I was able to go through this at lightening rate, dispite my gagging at all the saccharine. I threw it against the wall at the end.Was this the result of the author losing a bet with someone?"
3,Chick book,"This is not a bad story, just not his normal type of writing. It's an engaging read, just not very realistic."
4,Very touching,"This was the first time I've read James Patterson and I picked Suzanne's Diary simply because it was short and I wanted a quick read. It is a beautiful and touching love story and the diary format works well. The deep emotions, a mother's love, and the lesson of the five balls are all something that I will remember from this book. One minor disappointment that I found with this story was that I didn't feel like I got to know Katie as well as Suzanne, but that was probably intentional on the author's part."
1,"Sappy, Lame, Predictable Let Down by Patterson","If you are an avid reader of the 1st to Die series and are entertaining a little light reading; I recommend looking elsewhere. The story was supposed to be endearing but came off as cheap, shallow sappy drivel that was disconnected. The writing seemed to shoot for vivid and picturesque but only achieved remedial. I finished it only to formulate a complete opinion. That's HOURS of my life I will never get back. These books are like a champagne hangover, every few years we do it and then say 'Never Again.' I hope I can remember this in a few years.I recommend Laurel K. Hamilton; the Anita Blake series for the 1st to Die fans...get thru book 3 before you toss in the towel."
4,This Book Made Me Cry,"I liked this book: the story, the love, the way it was written. The ending made me cry because I know love like that rarely occurs. But it was also because I know love like that rarely exists that I'm didn't like it when I read that Matt moved on only after 2 years. That was a disappointment."
4,Unexpectedly Loved it,"Katie Wilkinson's boyfriend, Matt, suddenly leaves her, ending their almost year long relationship with no explanation. When she comes home from work, she finds a package at her door, in his handwriting and in it, is a diary his first wife had written for their son Nicholas.The story flashes back and forth as Katie reads Suzanne's diary. She finds herself liking Suzzanne and gets to know more about Matt. Its a story of love and loss and loving again. You might predict the end of the book, but you will still be shocked.This wasn't one of the most emotional books I've read, but it was very enjoyable. The writing style was a breath of fresh air after reading several books with pretentious writing styles. It was simple and interesting. I started it and couldn't put it down until I had finished it, which is something I haven't done in quite some time."
1,suzanne's diary for nicholas,"This book was a total waste of my time. I could not believe how unrealistic and sappy it was. I found myself scanning down pages to avoid some of the author's overdone rantings of love. I kept hoping something would occur in the story to save the plot.Unfortunately, it was totally predictable."
1,Huge disappointment!..,"James Patterson has established a reputation for writing fast paced, plot-driven thrillers. Unfortunately, he has not been able to successfully transfer this ability to the subtle, character-driven style necessary for his latest endeavor. The book is a disaster! The characters are cloying and two-dimensional. The minimal plot is practically non-existant and thoroughly predictable. Don't waste your time...."
1,"so trite, so disappointing","This book was exactly what I imagined it to be from the title and description. No surprises. I predicted everything. It had no more depth than the four-hundreth Daniel Steel-recipe. That Alex came back to her in the end and was merely waiting in the wings for her to ""understand"" was beyond hokey. The only opportunity for some originality was by utilizing the ""first Alex"" for something significant; but that was never developed. What a waste of time!"
4,Keeps liquids cooler longer but is too compact!,It definitely keeps milk cooler longer than any other bag but it really cannot hold more that 2 bottles. I had to go buy the Dr. Browns slimmer bottles (was using the wide neck ones before) so that I could store them in the cooler. There really isn't room for much else after the 2 bottles but it works for me needs.No need to insert gel packs. Just stick the sucker in the freezer and pull it out when you need it.
5,Lint Wizard,"Bought this for myself as I have owned one before. With two dogs, this helps with the furniture. When everyone in my office saw it I had to order one for each of them. Everyone is as impressed as I am. Easy to handle and much quicker than electric vacuums or lint rollers."
4,Really like this brush,"I bought one of these brushes at least 2 years ago and have been looking for another one for a long time. Came across an ad accidentally. I found it works very well on cat hair, on the sofa and on all my clothing. I loved it! I did break one hinge but I used packaging tape to fix it and it still works.well. Best of all it empties and saves me from buying dozens of disposable sheets. Worth every cent."
1,Don't buy...,"All it is is a red lint brush that is self cleaning. If the red lint brushes work for you then so will this....otherwise keep your money. BTW, a red lint brush at the dollar store + your vaccuum cleaner would be even cheaper."
5,One of the more unique and individualistic releases from 1996,"Though it did give us a few fresh talents like Kenny Lattimore and Maxwell, 1996 was mostly a very blah year for black music. One major exception is this brilliant album of pure, organic, alternative-type soul. Ambersunshower (which IS her real first name, believe it or not) is a first rate musician who makes the most out of spare, haunting beats, and is a skilled experimentalist who incorporates horns and guitars into her sound, making for a fresh, natural style that was largely absent from most soul music of the period. I would dare to say that if this had been released a few years later, it could be mistaken for a Jill Scott album."
4,Good book to catch the interest of reluctant students,"I use projects from this book to teach electrical and electronic packaging design (circuit boards) at a technical school. The projects are fun and simple enough to complete in a 12 week quarter. The range from a biorythm feedback project to a UFO detector. The schematic drawings are not to any known standard, but part of the fun for my students is ""correcting"" information from an expert source."
4,This is great so far,"Took it travelling, works great, good sharp picture and sound (with earphones). No drawbacks that I can find aside from needing the earphones (hence only 4 stars). Easy for children to use. Glad I got it."
1,"Piece of Junk, Spend a few bucks more, you'll be happy...","This player locked up several times. The screen would freeze and we would restart, then it would lock up again. I've probably written only one other review in 5+ years I've shopped Amazon. This product was so bad that I wanted to warn others. When we hooked it up to our TV, the picture was also bad. When I returned it, the store clerk told me that she gets these back all the time, and that she rarely gets back the Panasonics. If you are lucky enough to get one of these that works, then it's a great deal. But if it's ultimately doomed to fail, is it really a bargain. Better to spend an extra hundred bucks..."
5,Good Buy,"I was skeptical to buy this but it's worth it if you can get the extended warranty to insure your purchase for 2 years (the manufacturer only gives you 3 months labor and 1 year parts). The one I got works fine and I am impressed with the quality considering it is a generic brand. Apparently some other people got bad units but I guess Initial finally got their act together. Picture is good, sound is ok. You can't expect tiny speakers to sound like a home theater. It comes with everything you need except for the headphones (no big deal). It comes with a battery and charger, DC adapter, AC adapter, and a remote control. In the manual it said that the battery only will last about two hours but when I used it I got nearly four. This unit has been great for me. All in all, only get it with the extended warranty which is only like $30. Great buy for $200."
1,BAD picture problem out of the box,"We purchased ours on 3/6/04, out of the box there was a little green dot on the screen that did not go away no matter what we did. We changed and played several discs, but the little green dot in the very same placed remained. We exchanged the unit the same day for the same brand and model, out of the box there was another little green dot in a different space on the screen. We also noticed that when you turned the screen, there was much distortion (important if you have in the car and more than one person is viewing). We returned that unit and replaced it with an RCA (almost double the price). We have only had the RCA one day, but we like it, no picture distortion and defintely not a little green dot to be found>"
1,What a dud.,"I bought it and after only one week,the Lcd stopped working,for the life of me we couldn't figure out what was wrong.We tried it the following morning and we can hear the volume but still not see anything,I tried reaching the seller as I bought it from amazon,but the seller never contacted me,so I'm still trying to figure how I'll get my money back.Now I'm going to try the coby,hopefully that will work."
4,Great little dvd player,"I've had this player for nearly six (6) months now and have had no problems whatsoever. I have not experienced the problem that others below have mentioned with this sticking halfway through a disc. We've used it on vacations, at home, hooked up to t.v.s and have been pleased with this product's performance. The only drawback I have found is a slight distortion of the picture when I hook it up to a television, and play using the television screen, on certain movies that are widescreen format.Overall I would not hesitate to purchase this product. However, it might be wise to purchase an extended service plan."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I got this dvd player several months ago to take w/me when I fly. After several very frustrating trips where the thing would either not work at all or would stop working in the middle of a movie (which is even worse!), I returned it. The company was good about sending me a replacement. But I am having the exact same problems with the replacement!! This product not worth buying at 1/10th the price"
2,Does not have video input!,"This product says that it has video input, however it does not! I even called initial and they said it does not. If you dont need it for video input, then it's a good product."
2,Much room for improvement,"I'll start with the good points:1)Seems like an attractive price2)Nice picture quality and respectable viewable angle3)Decent sound4)Battery tends to last 3 hours or moreBUT, on the downside:1)Quality control is poor - I had to return the first one which quit working after 3 or 4 movies2)Flimsy hinge broke on second unit after a few months of infrequent use and very gentle handling by one user - me, so it no longer works and is probably cheaper to replace than fix3)Easy to lose tiny remote and that means you lose many features and functions4)Price is a bit high, considering.I intend to buy a new player, but not another Initial IMD-1731. Hopefully the old battery will work as a spare with the new unit. (It's nice to watch really scary movies while camping in the woods.)"
2,What Happened?,"I love the Cranberries, I think they are the best band with a female singer, but come on, what happened in this album? The first two were sooo good, and then this one came out... I hope that they get out of their rut with their next album, because they are truely and EXCELLENT WONDERFUL MARVELOUS band. I hope Delores likes her new Baby!!! :)( a side note: I wish I looked like Delores, she's so beautiful!)"
1,extremely disturbing,"Like only a couple of other reviewers, I found this book to go beyond the alpha male/submissive female role. In my opinion, the men bordered on bullying, abusive behaviors. Why would any man force the woman he loved to engage in sex with his brothers? Especially to ""prove"" that he loved those brothers? I simply do not understand that plot/conflict since I am not the dark of a person. While I have read several of Ms. Leigh's other books, and have enjoyed several, this series left me feeling...less than happy and thankful that I am not that dysfunctional nor spinless."
1,At least it was free,"I like Lora Leigh's books, her breed books etc. But this one....holy crap, can you say whiny, spoiled chick and 3 guys who need serious counciling and to stay the heck away from women until they've had it? Sorry to say if you were looking for a good Lora Leigh book, this aint it."
3,"Overall, an OK read","This was an OK read. The plot was enough to keep me hooked, and the sex was definitely hot. But the characters themselves made me just a bit uncomfortable, since this was about as close to incest as you can get without actually going over the line. Cade is an extremely dark hero, and you never really get the story behind why he & his brothers are the way they are, and Marly is just a bit to much like a spoiled brat for my liking. But, I'm one of those who, once I start a series, good, bad, or ugly, I try really hard to finish it. So, I'm off to Sarah's Seduction, Heather's Gift, and August Heat, hoping feverishly that they improve."
4,Comes in Second--behind the book,"I'm a relatively new fan to Twilight. Almost by accident I found and read the first Twilight book. After I did, I was hooked and immediately purchased and read the other books. Of course, reading the books heightens the desire to see the movie, so I purchased it. Though I enjoyed the movie very much, it paled in comparison to the book--an expected outcome I suppose. As for the quality of the product, it was great. I enjoyed the format. The DVD came to me in pristine condition, and I was pleased with my purchase."
3,Not A Bad Movie But...,"Not a bad movie but, I love thing's that are more serious. I don't really mind the romance but, it had way too much of it. I geuss in a way I like it a little but, my main complaint is that it has way too much romance in it.I mainly love underworld,Hellsing the english anime and more."
1,Too bad it is low budget and poor casting,"When I look back at watching the movie at the theater I am not as bummed out about it if I remind myself it is a B movie. I just loved the book and was disappointed that some of the character were poorly casted and the scenes cheesy. I am 31 so maybe I am not the target audience but I am sad that this wasnt done right, just didnt do the book justice. Edward wasnt casted right, yeah he's cute, but he and Bella had no chemistry on camera and that is the whole point of the story. Hopefully the next movie will be better."
4,Twighlight Movie Makes My Night,"I have to admit I thought the book was better, but the movie has its moments too.I bought this for my daughters birthday (after I got her hooked on the Twighlight Series). She has since watched the movie 10+ times! I have only watched twice!!! It is a good movie and I am glad I bought it. Can't wait for the rest of the movies to be out."
1,Horrible I tell you!,"The acting and storyline of vegetarian vamps is cheesy. This movie can't compare to Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) or Underworld movies. It's obvious why tweens like this movie, but I can't understand why some adults enjoy the Twilight series."
5,Great Twilight Extras,"I'm a big Twilight Saga fan and after reading reviews of this 3 disc version of the movie Twilight I decided to purchase it and I wasn't disappointed. I thought that the extras on the 2nd & 3rd discs were great! I'm still undecided as to if I will spend the extra money to purchase the 3 disc version of New Moon or not, but I think that for any true Twilight Saga fan the 3 disc version of the movie Twilight is a good pick. Love it!!"
5,Over 40 Loves Twilight,"I've heard about Twilight for a long time now. People have raved about it to me a lot, but I didn't see what was so great about a teen vampire book and movie. I just happened to be stuck at home one day and caught part of the movie on showtime. I have to say that it really draws you in. It made me want to read the book so that I could know what was not being said in the movie. When I finished with the first book, I had to read the next and recently finished the last. I am a fan now. I still can't believe it. It is really spellbinding. You really get caught in the story and the characters. That is why I'm giving it 5 stars, because it drew me in and I was entranced ...which hasn't happened in a very long time."
2,Still waiting but not alone!,"I bought this for my daughter and we are still waiting for this movie to arrive. We were under the impression that purchasing it so early would insure it's arrival by the 21st. What a mistake! We have been offered all the amenities to make up for the the delay; watching the movie on-line, discount in price. We could have had made it easy on ourselves and purchased from that store which has been mentioned by a previous reviewer who is also waiting.We are not alone, we have a neighbor's daughter who is also waiting!Misery does not always like company."
5,"The series are outstanding, magnetic in charm and story but movie..",is just okay. I still do watch it over and over. Casting wasn't great but Rob Pattinson is so yummy and he fits the part. The makeup on him is excellent! Meyer's is a genius and her stories transcend through all ages and eyes.Thank you
2,Maybe a rental movie...,"Half of the movie is spent up in a tree for some reason. I expected Edward to be ... more good looking. Not a great movie, not even a good movie, but if you have nothing at all to do one night, then maybe you can rent this for kicks."
1,I dont know if the book was this bad or its just the movie.,"There is nothing special about this movie. What was the fuss? A bunch of young teen girls thinking this movie was good. The acting is terrible. The scene where she gets bitten and crosses her eyes trying to look infected i lol. The scene where Edward carried the girl through the trees was hilarious. The movie was supposed to be serious i guess you wouldnt know it by watching it. I couldnt even watch this movie again, hard enough getting through it once."
2,Awfull giftset,"Got this as a birthday gift and was shocked at the low quality of the ""jewelery box"" it was allmost paper thin. My friend's daughter who the gift was for loved the movie however.My advice is save your money and buy just the dvd alone, I would not rate this set as good value for money and amazon should be ashamed at the money they charge for this item."
5,addict,"yeah... loyal anne rice fan and didnt want to betray her but out of curiosity i rented it online... this sucked me in and now i have the score, soundtrack, movie, and all the books in audio book so i can listen to it in the car... i cant believe myself... sigh..."
3,best of the bunch,This film is the best of the three to come out so far. I also bought the second film but I will NOT be buying any more. I wish they would have brought Catherine Hardwicke back to the directors chair.
2,cheesy at best.,"This was from 11 year olds, and parents. Not much better than typical horromedies where you are yelling at the screen for them not to go into the house. Girls had read the books and enjoyed them, but the movies were cheesy."
4,Twilight movie,"The movie was excellent especially if you did not read the book, but if you did read the book you'll find that many situations were changed and or added. I realize that Stephanie Meyers approved the movie and changes, so who am I to complain. Outside of that it was a very good movie."
3,Nice!!! but confusing,"It is nice that we are given a free rental so that we can watch Twilight now. My wife loves it very much. But I had a hard time putting in the promotional code, a warning keeps on coming up saying that there was a error. The trick was to ignore the warning and go to the next step."
1,Bare Bones,"After reading the series this movie was a complete let down! Watching the movie was like reading only the first sentence of each chapter. Too much was left out which caused the entire movie to be ""Missing"" something...Kinda like having Pizza without the sauce and toppings.Had I watched the movie before reading the books I would never have given the books half a chance and the books are excellent! Fantastic story to read..once you start you don't want to stop.Do your self a favor..read the books first..then RENT the movie if you just have to but don't waste your money on buying the movie..not worth $15.00!"
5,A Vampire Love Story for All Ages,Great movie I previewed and was able to share with my [...] year old who actually loved it. Wonderful extras...highly recommend it.
4,Twlight fans will want it,"I bought this for my daughters who are huge Twilght book fans and saw the movie multiple times in the theatre. It is an entertaining couple of hours, but those who are uber-fans of the book who haven't seen it (what, do you live under a rock?) may not be happy with a few details left out due to time or bugetary constraints. That being said, the girls still wanted it for our movie collection (yeah, ok, me, too.)."
5,Twilight is an incredible movie!,"I wasn't sure if I'd like the movie after reading the book, but it was fabulous! I even got my husband to watch it, then start reading the books! I am looking forward to owning the second movie in the series ""New Moon"", and it will be quite a few months before that happens!"
3,Without reading the book this makes no sense,I actually bought the books so I could understand the movie. The movie was just ok. I wish they could've found a better actress to play Bella.
3,NO BLOOPERS?!?!?!,"The DVD has a Kristen/Rob/Catherine commentary, deleted/extended scenes, and some documentary/making-of features which are all great, but I was looking forward to even more!! In interviews I remember hearing about Rob falling off the bed in a take of the kissing scene, pulling a muscle trying to pick Kristen up in the fight scene, and ad lib-ing piano music---NONE OF WHICH ARE ON THIS DVD :o( Summit could make so much more money off of this (and I hope they try...). I'm sure many people would pay for a whole other DVD of even MORE EXTRAS. And NO Bloopers?!?!?!?! COME ON! But as far as the movie itself goes (and not DVD feature let-down)--- 5 stars!"
5,TWIHard FAN!!!,I have all the other movies (even pre-ordered breaking dawn part 1) and I REALLY love them all!I needed to add this one to my collection and while shopping around saw that this site had the lowest price I purchased it. I recieved the packaged within a few days of order and it was tightly sealed with *NO* damage. I am very happy to place this and any order I make with Amazon. I have ordered other products and only had maybe a couple minor issues but they have always been happy to fix the problem or refund my money. This product is a mus have for any fan because yo wont find better prices for the same sevice! ~~~Happy buying~~~
3,Believe it or not it was better than the book,"I held back on watching this mainly because I didn't care for the book. I thought it came off amatuerish at best. But hey art is subjective. As campy and cheesy as this production is, I sorta liked it and would have probably loved it if I was 20 years younger. There is nothing wrong with the concept I simply believe the screenwriter improved upon what was lacking in the novel. The actors...well that's another story. Stewart, I believe performed well, but Pattinson simply brought his good looks. In much of the scenes he looks more like an actor struggling with a career choice than a vampire in turmoil. Still the kissing scene touched my old romantic side and I was willing to over look some awkwardness in his growling and flitting running scenes. With the money this production has made I suspect New Moon will have better CGI. Here's hoping."
4,"A great movie, but the books are even better...","When I first saw this movie, I was completely drawn into the story and it made me want to know more about the characters and what would happen next. I could feel the tension and the chemistry between Bella and Edward and I thought it was an extremely well made film. Having already fallen in love with the film, I thought I should go ahead and finally read the books. Now as I am reading the books for the second time through, I can honestly say that the original Twilight book was much better than the film. The director did capture the essence of the story and the characters, but as with all movies adapted from books, there will always be changes and omissions that an avid fan of the book will find disappointing. I will never forget the first time I saw this DVD and I am grateful that it introduced me to such an amazing series. I own the DVD and I've watched it several times, but overall I feel the version in print is superior."
3,Not much bang for your buck,"With all the Blu-Ray editions out there offering a DVD copy and a digital copy and Twilight offering none of these, the price on this is a bit much. I just took it for granted that it would come with one or the other if not both, but I was wrong. The quality is great but honestly I don't feel for this particular film that the jump from DVD to Blu-ray was worth it, I do believe it will be well worth it on the second installment of this series, New Moon. You will be happier with the film if you haven't read the book or if you read the book and aren't a serious fan. The movie left a lot of important details out that would have made the film much more noteworthy. I loved the books but wasn't all that happy with the film."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!,I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss was about. BIG waste of my time. I wish I could have those two hours of my life back.
1,"Great Movie but this item is not available yet, so how do I review",...I don't see how this Special edition DVD has over reviews when it doesn't come out for another month?????? The movie is good but this special edition might be lame and not worth the price.....so I will publish a VALID and CREDIBLE review when the item comes out AMAZON.
4,Pre-ordering the DVD,"I preordered a copy of the movie on walmart's website. Its only about 50 cents cheaper, but the shipping is a lot less (its between 2 and 3 dollars) and their arrival date is Saturday the 21st. Amazons shipping is more expensive and they gave me an arrival date of the 25th."
5,I TOO HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE 4 TIMES!!!!! LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!!!!,"Well, what can I say. I did not read the books coz it was not my genre but ever since I saw the movie 4 times and was disappointed by not watching it again, I bought all the books and now starting to read all of them. I cannot wait to own this in DVD and start my own collection of it. I thought that the actors that were chosen to play the characters, let me just say that the roles are really for them and I think that's what made it such a good movie, the camaraderie of each and everyone of them really shines. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have that kind of chemistry that they don't even have to say anything to each other or deliver a line, they can still make everything click together. Anyway, I am so excited in getting this DVD. Pre-order now coz nobody knows if when it comes out if it will be sold out in a matter of seconds."
2,I can't Believe,"I was really surprised that they changed the movie from what was seen in the theater. Edward told Bella to Google something? and When did he become som human, that he could not articulate about the colors of his eyes? OMG!! I was so upset. I really hope that there is a second version on the DVD or I will definately send it back."
3,Average +,"Average or mediocre movie. Does not do justice to the book. Bella's character is made even less likable than in the book (morose, boring, never smiling individual, etc)."
4,good movie,I liked this movie. It came on time and was not messed up at all. It was good movie to watch and very visually stimulating.
2,Please read the books!!!,"This movie leaves out a lot of critical and heart-pounding scenes from the book. This movie is very choppy, also. Please, I beg you, if you watch the movie first before reading the books...you may not want to read the bokks, however, they are 120times better. This comes from a person who always would rather watch a movie than read a book. Don't get me wrong, I have seen the movie 3x already just because of certain characters are hot, and some scenes are rewind-worthy."
4,Twilight The Movie....,"While i'm appreciative of Amazon allowing the free rental of the product, the connection wasn't so great and the movie skipped. I still loved it but wished it didn't pause and freeze so much...."
1,bland,The director managed to suck all of the passion and tension out of the book. Maybe she's the real vampire. I want a re-do.
4,The promo code mishap,"My promo code was deemed incorrect also, but when I hit the button to buy 24 hour rental, the promo was redeemed and I was charged nothing. I guess it was working, Amazon just didn't know it yet. First time I've seen the movie. I loved it. Looking forward to the extras on the DVD. Great quality!"
5,Excellent,Love this! An instant classic! Can't wait to watch it over and over again! And the disc was in very good shape.
2,An empty Harlequin romance with vampires,"I got this at a Redbox in Boulder City while at a garage sale. What a waste. I almost fell asleep in the first 20 minutes. Wooden acting, straight from the Winona Ryder School of Thespian-ism: a couple of facial expressions, one of which includes a gaping mouth, and a lot of staring (see Winona Ryder's performance in Alien Ressurection). In addition, no one has a sense of humor, there is no sense of drama, it gets a little interesting toward the end (sort of). I often found myself finishing the actors' sentences (yes it was that predictable). Wasted a buck and about 90 minutes of time I could have spent doing something more constructive."
2,Twilight (Single-Disc Edition),I did not get thee exact cover it was suppose to come with they ripped me! Never ordering from that person again
1,ITEM NOT RECEIVED,I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ON 5/14 - IT'S NOW 6/21 AND I STILL DON'T HAVE THE PRODUCT. I EMAILED THE VENDOR AND DID NOT EVEN GET A REPLY.
1,Deceptive Seller,The way the deceptive ad read I thought that I was buying a special addition two disk set. What I received was one disk (the movie) which was in the DVD movie jacket for one DVD (the movie) from Blockbusters. It was mailed in an envelope with no padding and the DVD was loose inside the cover. When I complained to the seller I was told that they would give me free shipping on my next purchase. There would never be another purchase!
5,"loved it, saw it too many times to remember","So when I heard they were making a movie i freaked I read this book when it was first release in 06. I went nuts i was a little worried about the budget being so small, but heck all the big studios didnt want it. I hope they all feel stupid right now. The movie was awesome the way the emotions were played out and the angst that made you squirm in your chair was awesome. Every emotion came into play with this movie. You almost cried when she left charlie, laughed at the baseball scene, worried during the ballet scene. It has everything a TWI-hard could want.CAn't wait for the next one!!!"
2,romantic gentle movie,"To me, Twilight is a romantic gentle movie. It's full of visual and graphic ideas, and the alchemy with the music is perfect (""Supermassive black hole"" on the baseball sequence). I think one of the reasons of its success is that in the Twilight world, as in Disney's, no one really has a sex life, in opposition to most vampire movies. It doesn't bother anyone, it's not subversive (at all!) so it's for all ages! The bonus disc is not so interesting, not original, full of self-approbation as many. Anyway, the soundtrack by Carter Burwell is amazing, magic and melancholic. It gives the movie the magic touch necessary to be something else than a pop corn commercial film."
4,"C'mon, it was fun for what it is...","There are a lot of haters out there, and I do appreciate that it's not fine cinema. It's not meant to be. It's fun to watch, you get into it, but I understand the complaints. The vampire purists will hate it. The glittery skin is lame, the car is lame, the soundtrack is lame, and sometimes the CGI is lame. It's marketing itself as a tweener film, and it is, but it's still fun. If you can't get over it, get over yourself and go review something else."
5,If you love vampires . . . you'll love this,"I saw the movie without any expectations at all. I found it very enjoyable. I liked it so much i bought the first book and read it. i loved that so much that i bought all three of the other ones. Excellent books, excellent movie."
4,The book is always better,"I am a reader...and any reader is going to tell you that the book is always better then the movie. A book is always more detailed and the explanations are always there for every question you might have. Not only a better understanding of the characters but of the relationships the characters have with one another. The book gives you a clearer picture of Edward and Bella's love for one another and the movie pretty much ignores the details of the friendship formed by Bella and Alice. The fight scene at the end and the baseball scene was much more detailed and nicely portrayed in the movie. But overall, good movie but book still wins my vote."
4,Twilight,Catherine Hardwicke did a wonderful job of trying to keep to the book. I only wish she included a few scenes that were in the book: the blood typing in class and the scene at the house where she is introduced to the Cullen Family.
2,Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific.,"The acting was TV Soap Opera meets Harlequin Romance. Kristen Stewart did the same eye fluttering speech stuttering through the entire film. The entire film. That and her shampoo commercial wind in the hair scenes. There were some bright spots... the dad and Kristen, the concept underneath of this established vampire family in a community - the neighboring tribe keeping an eye on them. But scenes of Stewart's sudden desperate desire to for life eternal undo the positive. There is just not enough to keep this movie glued together."
2,"Very disappointing, not at all exciting","Ok, I read the entire Twilight book series and they were great! I had high hopes and very excited when I first got the DVD to watch the movie. How disappointing! The story line was horrible, nothing like the books, Bella was more boring than a toilet bowl brush, and unless you had already read the books, you probably would not have a clue about what was going on. The graphic effects and make-up were class B or worse. Acting could definitely be better. I never watched it again. I would not waste my time or money on it. If you are still interested, please read the books first before you watch the movie."
1,Unhappy,I ordered the video and paid for the one day shipping rates and received it 3 days later. This was a last minute birthday gift which cause me to purchase another gift. I wrote Amazon concerning this incident with no response in return.
2,Book is definately better!,"The movie is alright, poor choices for lead characters but overall just read the book again, don't waste your time on the movie"
5,I had to see this twice to fully appreciate it,Many people read the book before seeing the movie. I did not. Perhaps that is why seeing it a second time was a better experience for me. The second time really hooked me on these characters.
2,If you're in the mood for tofu,"I really wanted to like this movie. I've read the series several times and perhaps that is part of the problem. I know movies must condense and modify, but the movie's atmosphere is not even a shadow of the book. The book speeds through their romance fast enough as it is, but the movie takes such leaps there is no romance, only tension. My list of dislikes is long but my two biggest disappointments: 1) They change the sequence of some elements which really effects the romance storyline; and 2) WHERE IS EDWARD'S SENSE OF HUMOR? At some points he's just a rude jerk. The movie gives no balance to his character. I watched it a second time trying to be more objective and it wasn't quite as painful to watch. But it's still Twilight tofu for me."
5,Great,"Item arrived on time and is just as advertised. Was still in original packaging. Everything works great, would use this vendor again."
3,I HOPE IT WORKS,"Unable to leave packaging feedback for some unknown reason. Blu-ray disc just came today. The shrink wrap job is horrible and loose. There are no sealed stickers underneath the poor shrink wrap, u know the ones that say security device enclosed. This item was suppose to come brand new. I wonder whether it is used, or was returned by someone. There is also a big puncture on the back of the shrink wrapped case as well. It's a Christmas gift for my girlfriend so I hope it works!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I've read all four books in the Twilight series so needless to say I was excited when a movie came out. But, like most book to movie adaptations this movie was lacking in many areas. The Direction was poor, the acting was poor, there was no chemistry or emotion between the main characters as they would have you believe. The best acting was done by secondary characters which sadly were given very very little screen time. I am however looking forward to New Moon to see how Taylor Lautner acts in place of the Stone-cold , jerkish Edward"
3,If I Was Your Glampire!!!,"For the past two years, I have avoided this movie like the plague. It just looked ridiculous, and melodramatic because of sparkly vampires. There was a double feature last week, and I finally decided to cave in and watch. It wasn't as horrible as I wanted it to be, but I'll still make fun of it. In case you don't know the story, I'll give you a quick version; Bella Swan is forced to move to Forks, Washington where it's always cloudy and raining. She soon meets Edward Cullen, who just happens to be a vampire...that sparkles. When Edward saves her from almost being hit by a van, she slowly begins to fall suicidally in love with him. If you love melodramatic love stories about vampires, you'll love TWILIGHT!!!"
4,unsatfied book reader,"My friend had recomended these books to me so i got the first one and read it i was hooked! so i read the rest of the books and i was stoked when Breaking Dawn came out when my friends and i herd about the movie we were so excited! on the day it came out we saw it i was very disapointed with it i liked all the casting excpt for edward the guy who they casted was HIDIOUS!!! that is not how i imagined edward. also ond day when i was watching one of the star gosip shows i saw that they had a deleted scean from the movie and edward gave bella a ""love bite"" he drew blood!! she would be a vampire!! for gods sake and he woudent be able to stop! i was outraged when i saw it. they totally screwed up the movie!! bitches!"
2,interesting but could have been better,"some of the transitions between scenes were odd. The film also didn't really work in terms of getting me to empathize with the female lead except towards the end. Edward was interesting though I honestly debated about whether he was a stalker until the issue with James was made clearer. Overall, as someone who watched the movie but hasn't read the books, (I like watching movies without any book bias, makes enjoying them easier) I can say it might be something I could watch at a party with some good friends but nothing special and certainly not something I would recommend to my vampire-obsessed friends."
5,Haunting!,"The books are wonderful, this movie is better after you've seen it a second time. Also after you've read Edwards side of the story, (""Stephenie Meyers' site"" version), you have the ""aha"" thing going on, on why he's so tormented. Stephenie please please complete ""Midnight Sun"" your imagination is again...phenomenal."
2,poor quality,The quality of this movie is very poor. The mouth movement and the voices don't even match up!! It's like watching an old kung-fu movie.
5,Loved it!!!,"I love the Twilight Saga and the disc was used but like new. No signs of use at all. Looked brand new, even case was in perfect condition!!!!!"
4,Good Movie - Blu-ray early release at B*st B*y and T*rg*t,T*rg*t and b*st B*y managed to get a exclusive release date on Blu-ray for this movie. It will be released on Blu-ray everywhere on the 1 May but you can get it on 21 March at those to locations.
4,Gosh!!! you all going to hate me,I really didnt like this movie ... i down right kind of hated it ... i loved the books! I was a fan before anyone even knew about them I would say... but i thought the movie was missing a lot .. yes its fine for a one shot kind of movie but thats it .. they forgot a lot of great parts that where in the books and not in the movie then what the point .. also for the new moon how can they make little jack black look so big ... they are going to use the same actor well his only like 5'8 something ... in new moon he becomes 6 foot something ... i really dont see how that is going to work but yet again thats me ...
2,dont buy,if you are looking for a good quality product dont buy this..I did and the watch broke and the pics are awful i dont even touch the box because in to afarid it will fall apart.If you are older and just want something to look at the go ahead but remember you are not getting what you pay for.Buyer Beware......
2,A review of the collector's edition set and not the movie,"While I love the books and the movie. This review is about the actual item, the collector's edition set. First of all $79.99 is way too much. The set is cool but it is not $79.99 cool. If it was cheaper I would have nothing bad to say about it, but paying this much I expected a little more. Granted I figured the watch was cheap plastic, but I expected this so called jewelry box to at least be plastic or anything but cardboard. It's carboard and doesn't even snap close because it's not aligned right. The charm bracelet is also plastic, I expected at least a higher end plastic then what it is. The photo cards are cool and the bookmark is cool. All the hype about a New Moon teaser is in fact just a tease. Apparently even though the dvd has BD Live, Summit has not released anything for it so the only thing on the BD Live is the trailers that play as soon as you put the dvd in your player. Overall, I'm a little disappointed."
4,Christmas gift that was loved by my girls!!,"I always liked vampire movies - but not to the degree that the 2 young girls living in my household do! They have fallen in love with the Twilight movies/books. They are only 9 and 10 yrs old!! All the older one wanted for Christmas was the Twilight movie, the calendars with pictuers from the movies, and the set of books. She got her wish - and about 1 hour after opening gifts this holiday, the dvd of Twilight was out into the player and was being watched! They love this movie - most teenage girls/boys do. There is something about the way this story is told - and it works! Two thumbs up from us!!"
5,Great movie,This is really a great movie. It's a new take on an old story line. I loved all the Ann Rice books but this puts the vampire into a more modern setting. Seems to work for all age groups.
3,NOT ENOUGH TIM BUR TON,"THey could've gotten anyone to play Barnie Fark the evil vampire--Mr. Cullen is not being historically accurate in the making of this film. Not believeable, either--unrealistic--way too many cutscenes with cats. Why? There also, does not exist any English or Braile Subtitles. They broke the rules when playing baseball--last time I CHECKED BASEBALL IS NOT PLAYED AT NIGHT! Books by Stephenie Maydoff were way more mature and convincing. Movie goes too fast, cannot read along in book--which lacks brail. ASL interpreter costs extra, I should not have to pay this after all the other trouble I've gone through. I'd prefer to watch Heller Kellen play Mario Kart than watch this krap again. Will exchange once finished. Do not waste your $$$ or '"
3,so bad it's good!,"this movie so bad that it's good. everything about this movie is cheeseball, but you can't help but watch it. it's really is addictive. i've seen every single Twilight series movie to date and I can't make myself stop! i can't get enough of the cheesy dialogue, funny action sequences, and shirtless werewolves LOL!"
3,Not Worth the Hype,"It took me a lot longer than the average female to watch the famous Twilight series... but being in Afghanistan, and I have nothing better to do, I decided to read the books and finally order the movies. The book series was actually decent, and even made me excited for the movie.I had to watch Twilight twice before I made my final decision. I remember getting half way through it and thinking:1. Kristen Stewart is a horrible actress.2. For how popular the Twilight series was and how much money it would surely rake in, the production was decent at best.It's true what they say, the book is always better than the movie. Twilight is no exception.. (Sorry die-hard Robert Patterson and Taylor Lautner fans.)"
4,Twilight Rocks ~ Great Vampire Flick,"I know what you are going to say, ""What is so special about Twilight?"" Well, for those vampire and gothic fans it is a Huge deal. There has not been a great vampire flick since Queen of the Damned. So for those Twilight fans I applaud you for seeing the movie, and supporting the creative juices of writers. I hope to see more vampire books and movies in the future. Namaste."
4,Twilight - Not just for tweens,"I saw this movie and did not know what to expect, but it exceeded my expectations by far (already had the wonderful soundtrack), and was pleasantly surprised. Well casted, well directed, a quality and innovative film, with a killer soundtrack - hope the next director lives up to this one's product - see it, you won't be dissapointed!"
4,Sucker for romance,"I felt silly after finding out that this novel was made for teenagers, and being 30 I felt even a little embarassed thinking, ""Am I the only one who liked this movie?"" but seeing the reports out there I feel SO in sync with everyone...at 1st I didn't think it was so good...didn't even think that the actor was cute..but after talking about it I thought, ""AWWWWW.."" and ""man he's a cutie!! look at that smile!"" and now I want the DVD......guess there is that person in all of us who still want to be swept off our feet an taken care of...THE ROMANCE!!When I fall hard for a movie it's over..the last movie I fell over was ""Phantom of the Opera"" with Gerard Butler...which explains my pen name :)"
4,"Four books, one movie","My husband bought 2-disc DVD yesterday & we galloped home to watch it that night. I LOVED movie, have read all 4 books, while my husband's read none of them. My biggest problem is the director who didn't capture the essence of the characters and the spirit of the thing. I hope they continue making sequels to cover the next 3 books & that they choose a different director! BTW, for a minute there I was upset thinking ""they'd left out a whole bunch"" but then, duh, realized that this was Twilight & I was thinking in terms of all 4 books!!! Sigh, but do hope for more. Alice's character was great! Think Bella could have been a bit more lighthearted in her portrayal, Edward was excellent, & the rest okay, but again think director didn't put movie together very well & failed to get the performances that could have been there."
1,One more unhappy customer,"I see I'm one of many who was issued an invalid promotional code for a viewing of Twilight, compliments of Amazon. How irritating to try over and over again to get the promo code to work, only to be prompted each time by Amazon that ""there's something wrong with the claim code you entered."" As if it's my fault that they issued me a bogus code! This is unacceptable. I'd appreciate it if Amazon applied the value of my unusable $3.99 online rental to my next purchase."
5,Wonderful Movie,"Twilight is not just another vampire movie. It's a love story with excellent actors and fantastic sound effects. It gives vampires a whole new image. Honestly, you wouldn't mind being bitten by Edward. I love this movie. Looking forward to watching New Moon."
3,Forgettable hokum,"The Bottom Line:I went into this movie expecting to hate it due to the book's deplorably 1950s brand of gender relations and oh-so-tired sexy vampire motif but was pleasantly surprised to find that the film is more mediocre than out-and-out bad; boasting some cool shots (Bella and Edward in the treetops, the baseball game in the storm) and some terrible ones (Edward sucking the venom out of Bella at the end, Edward convulsing when she walks into class) the film version of Twilight is less awful than it could be, and that's the best compliment I can think of for it.2.5/4"
1,Disappointing if you're a fan of the books,"I just don't understand why they couldn't stay a little truer to the books that I am a huge fan of. The most touching parts have been changed or are not there at all especially the meadow scene, where Edward and Bella really bond - in the movie there is a lot of Bella running after Edward which did NOT happen. The main actors were excellent but the supporting cast was rubbish apart from Bella's father. All the scenes are disconnected and don't flow well at all. I do hope they do a better job in the next one."
2,Sub-par acting,"Perhaps its their ages - they are young adults and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here, they may not have accrued much acting experience.Don't get me wrong, I mean, I enjoyed the books. The CGI is well done, the locations are beautiful filmed."
4,My review,From what I heard about the Twilight it's one of the theaters best sell out. My daughter is a very big fan
4,Great!,I purchased the 1st 2 CD's for the Twilight Saga & had seen the 1st movie a couple of times. So I knew what to expect with the purchase of the 1st movie Twilight. But the 2nd one was better than I expected. I cannot wait for the rest. And I believe in the good quality I recieved from purchasing these through Amazon. Thank you.
5,Twilight,My movie arrived soon after i ordered it and it played great. the price online for this movie was the best aswell.
2,badly made movie...,"This is bad...the movie does not live up to the popularity of the book. The studio should have not using this director... bad acting too.,,please create better movie for the new moon sequel.."
4,comparison,"As a movie by itself it was well done, but in a comparison with the novel, I was highly impressed with the closeness. The movie and novel similarities are rare considering many films often deviate from the novel. The downside is the lack of background given. Alice's character is left very under developed in the film whereas the novel gives a lot to her character. As well as conversations between Carlisle, Bella, and Edward."
5,The most worthy alcohol coinsure based book,This book has single handedly enhanced my pallet. The distinction that it makes between cut-rate and high-quality named liquors is such an important addition that is lacking in other cocktail books I have read.There is a simple elegance throughout the entire book. It is playful but easy to understand. The drink recipes are superiorly organized. I love everything about this book.
4,Better than most pop-punk bands,"Alkaline Trio happen to be the best pop-punk band since Green day. Sorry Blink,and all that other weak highschool girlfriend songs bands . These guys just seem to put more effort into their music than most other bands in the same arena. This album is no different. It's a lot darker and it seemed like thats the way this band was going anyways, more gothic imagery and gorey detailed lyrics. The songs seem a lot faster and harder too compared to from here to infirmary which was more on the pop side of things. Mostly cause the new drummer comes in with more of a ferocius drumming style.The first 6 songs are probably the best and catchiest but the last 3 are my personal favorite. tHE DONNER PARTY IS haunting and If we never go inside its amazing. Dan andriano really stands out in this album. Matt skiba great as usual but Danny steals the show."
1,Is this the same band?,"When I first heard this CD I wondered if i had accidently bought the wrong one. After owning Goddammnit!, Maybe I'll Catch Fire, and From Here to Infirmary I was appalled to here the poppy cacophony pouring from my speakers. I was dismally disappointed by Good Mourning. I had anticipated a great cd and truly depressed to hear the direction these guys are going in. Let's hope they won't be the next MTV ....And what's up with the way the dude sings? I couldnt even tell if it was the same guy. I just hope they can dig up the talent they had in Goddammnit and Maybe I'll Catch Fire. I love the band but this cd [stinks]. Buy Goddammnit and Maybe I'll Catch Fire if you want to experience Alk3's true talent."
2,Far From Good,This cd just does not cut it for me. Id say im an Alkaline Trio fan and this cd was just horrible. All the songs except like 2 are very boring and a train wreck to listen to. The singer voice isen't that good as its been before. It just seems like they did not try very hard on this album. I hope from a better relase next time.
3,is that matt singing?,"wow, i saw them on warped tour right before they were recording this album. matt sang, well, like he always did. what happened to his voice. i know he blew it out, but this is just ridiculous. however there are some memorable moments on this album, mostly by dan though. thats not a bad thing though, dan's songs have always stuck out in a good way. stuff like message from kathleen and maybe i'll catch fire. now he's got 100 stories and if we never go inside. it seems like dan is really starting to steal the show for alkaline trio. if that happens maybe they could rename the band, maybe something along the lines of Tuesday. (thats a joke, get it? or did you just here we've had enough and don't know anything about the band or pnk in general)"
3,Ryo Ohki OVA 3,Just adding this review as a disclaimer that this is the third OVA from a couple years back. If you were looking for the original series from 1992 - this isn't it.
2,Misleading,"The information on this leads you to think its the entire Tenchi series, its the last 7 episodes of the OVAs ( the worst ones )the descriptions need to be re written to reflect that this is NOT the complete series."
5,Haven't I seen this before....?,"The Mihoshi special was really good but it was way too similar to Journy Through Time and Space(Tenchi Universe.) Ayeka was again supposed to marry Tenchi and that's the last thing most of us would want to see. I wasn't too happy about seeing Washu as a bad guy. The episode was not bad...don't get me wrong, I just expected a new plot.I reccomend this video for TENCHI fans and non-TENCHI fans. It is good.I love Ryoko in this episode especially because she's adorable! Enjoy the video^_-!"
2,wend bad after 8 months,"I have purchased this LCD screen and it worked great - But after 8 months of use it started to have problems (2 big black lines in the middle of the screen). I have sent it to Viewsonic for repair - and didn't get it back after more than 1 month, although the customer representative told me that I will get it back after 21 days.Buyers beware !"
1,Too big,"I ordered the size I always wear in Easy Spirit shoes and found them too long,too loose in the heel and a bit tight across the widest part of my foot. Not up to Easy Spirit's usual standards."
3,The Heel was too Deep!,"I purchased this shoe looking for comfortable walking shoes and the one problem I had was the heel of the shoe too deep which caused it to rub the back of my foot and gave me really bad blisters. I had to buy heel pads to lift my heels in the shoe. I wear a size 10, other than that it's comfortable"
1,Rust bucket,Cleaned and dried immediately upon receipt. Used once and then cleaned a second time. Product immediately rusted and had to be thrown out.
5,squeak the mouuuuse,"Just wanted to get my words in edge wise about this book! I bought my copy back in 1987. The first words out of my mouth were 'This is where Groening (The Simpsons creator & so called creator of itchy & scratchy) stole this from!' It is great fun to read, & once you read it's as if the images stay imprinted in your brain! It is truly a work of art! ... Just like the guy in the first review here at amazon I wanted more as soon as I read it the first time!"""
2,worth a laugh,remembered this movie from when I was a kid. Obviously it did not stand up over the years. I'll probably save it for the grandkids who might get a kick out of it when they get a little older.
4,A very good 1955 Si-Fi movie,This film was made in 1955 and for it's time a very well made movie. The acting was very good by all. I do have a few comments that I felt film could have been done better. The climbing sequences was way to long and should have been filmed out side and not on a sound stage. But again this was a 1955 production and the green-tinted I felt took away from the movie. But this was a 1955 film and it was a interesting approach to add some drama as they enter Lost Continent. I give this film a four star rating for the time when it was made.
3,"""I've gone color blind! And me with 20/20 vision!""","This film takes forever to get anywhere and once it finally gets to the famous green sequence, it’s too little far too late. Amusingly, it takes them days to reach their destination (climbing to the top of a plateau) but only minutes to get down again. This film is awkwardly divided into pat segments. The filmmakers have the characters lingering slowly no matter where they are: command central, a date, the flight to hell, the crash, the climb, wandering for days on a plateau. Only the finale is rushed. I’d say it was almost worth it for the dinosaurs but unfortunately, the dinosaurs are overly cute looking and not a little silly. At least the actors gave it everything they’ve got. Cesar Romero could read from a phone book and make it entertaining. But. Never has 84 minutes felt more like hours..................wasted."
5,A SURE RESULT OF THE GOLDEN AGE OF HOLLYWOOD,I FELL FOR THIS MOVIE FROM THE DAY IT CAME OUT..JUST AN ALL AROUND GREAT FILM.
3,Good quality but order 2 sizes larger than normal,"I am 5'10, 190 lbs and have a 40 inch waist. First ordered a couple of size 2XL, thinking that size should be sufficient. The unstretched waist size of a 2XL is now 27 inches. Totally unwearable. Ordered some 3 XL's. Unstretched waist is 28 inches. VERY tight. Moved to 4 XL's. Waist on these is now 30 inches (I wash everything in the washer and line dry)! I can wear them, but they are uncomfortable. I have to wear a jock because of injuries I received in the Navy. Nuff said. I just ordered some 5 XL's. I have bought from a dozen different manufactures, and these are by far the best quality, but order AT LEAST two sizes larger than you normally wear.White Athletic Supporter"
1,Too old to be sold,"This book was written in 1996. It claims it was updated in 1999. However it quotes a price in French Francs. The Euro replaced the French Franc in 1998. In my opinion, travel books which are this old should not be sold. Don't buy this book!"
5,Couldn't use but...,"It's a helluva heavy duty locking gas cap...just didn't fit my application, as I needed it for a mini chopper gas tank, and this cap is 1/4 inch too small in diameter..."
1,Defective,"I really like this DVD, the workout was great for the morning... BUT I never saw the end of it. TWO copies were defective, they played to about the middle of the workout, and then skipped forever, froze the computer and crashed the system. I tried 5 different DVD player programs and never got it to work. FYI I was trying to run it on a Dell 3800. Eventually, I gave up and returned both copies"
3,Painfully slow - I could only do it a few times,"I never once broke a sweat doing this workout. How can you lose weight if you never raise your heartrate? I've been doing yoga for three years and this was so elementary, I had to turn off the audio and just watch the poses. This would be good for people who just want to relax and stretch but if you are serious about yoga I wouldn't bother."
4,Great for beginners and people who need modifications,"I had bought this years ago on VHS. Sadly don't have a player or tv anymore, so I finally decided to buy it on dvd to play on my computer. It moves at a pace that is doable for most and offers modifications for most postures. highly recommend it."
4,A good choice for beginners,I would recommend this for beginners. I have to keep buying this DVD since my friends and family keep taking them from me after trying it once. It gives level options that you can select and slowing work your way up.
5,Great DVD,I have only been doing yoga since Jan.2007. This is perfect for beginners. I highly recommend it.
1,Ugh!! Terrible,"I'd been doing yoga for about half a year when I bought this DVD. I wanted something that was still simple, but with some different poses. I liked the idea of the personal trainer to explain some of the poses in greater depth, never did get around to using it.Suzanne is a terrible instructor. She doesn't give clear direction on how to transition from one element of a pose to another. These are her directions to go from standing Forward bend to Victorious pose: ""Sweep you arms forward and breathe, breath"". She is terrible, frustrating and a waste of money in my opinoion. I will never buy anything with her again."
3,Not a good video,I don't like this yoga dvd. I bought it and was excited to use it in addition to my yoga class twice weekly. I don't like the way it is narrated with different levels. It is not easy to follow and I don't feel relaxed afterward. Something about Suzannes Deason's voice....YUCK!
5,Wonderful,"I absolutely love this work out.It's simple and effective.Anyone can do this.There are several levels of participation on this dvd.It takes very little time out of my day.I find doing this yoga routine 3 days a week works for me.At 58 years old I needed something to help me tone up and to help me with flexability.I feel better, I have lost weight and I have lost many inches in only one month.I highly recomend this for all ages.It WORKS!!!"
2,WARNING-Only for beginners,"This DVD is only for beginners. I thought this DVD would at least have an advanced workout since it states that there are 4 levels. I would hardly call it weight loss, even for beginners. It is probably a good stretching routine, but not a workout, especially for people who have taken yoga before."
1,Slow and boring,I've been doing yoga for a few weeks with Inhale on the Oxygen channel. I was looking for some similar DVDs. This is not it. Very slow moving and boring - definitely not fat burning.
2,Misleading,"Maybe I just misinterpreted what this DVD was about, but I thought the title and information was very misleading. I'm only 16 and I'm not a hardcore yogi, but I found this DVD way too easy to be anything related to weight loss.Pros:-Mentally, it prepares you for lossing weight (I guess).-The strecthes felt good after doing the Crunch The Perfect Yoga Workout DVD.Cons:-Physically, it's no where near helping you actually loss weight.-Too Spiritual.-I actually prefer the gym or in a room setting because I can relate better to that than someone who gets to be out in the wild, while I'm stuck in a room.-Too easy-The streches that actually felt really good weren't held long enough for me.It's really about personal preference and how physically fit you are. If you aren't very flexible and are just starting yoga, get this dvd. For a step up try Crunch The Perfect Yoga DVD instead."
4,I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!,"I love this video!!! I had NEVER done YOGA when I got the tape but was pleasantly surprised!!! I found it very calming and relaxing. I was nervous when I started because I had injured my neck/back in a car accident a year prior to starting, but believe it or not it helped so much!!! I feel so incredibly great when I am finished! SO completely calmed and relaxed yet energized at the same time. I only wish the video was about 30-35 mins rather that 55 (at times I thinking about everything else I had to do that day and felt I was running low on time) other than that I highly recommend this video. IT MAKES YOU FEEL GREAT!!! :)"
3,A great beginning video- weight loss??- feel better eat less,"This is a good video for beginning yoga students. The continuous showing of multiple variations is very helpful for beginners and those who may have the anatomical incumberances of a few extra bulges. I suspect that the weight loss title is a gimmick to sell the video. For those like me who already know some yoga, but have embraced the ""food is God concept"" a little too well perhaps it is time to move on to Ashtanga. There now seems to be a formula to sell yoga videos. 1.) Get instructors 2) Go to pristine natural setting, blue sky with few clouds highly recommended 3) play relaxing music in background. This one fits that formula as do most recent videos. The Arizona canyon lands is a pleasing background."
3,Inappropriate title - good beginner's vinyasa,This is a solid and nicely-produced yoga routine for beginners. I would rate it more highly if the title had not led me to expect a more vigorous workout.
4,My Life in Ruins ~ an excellent choice!,"Well, Nia Vardalos does it again...such charm...so believable. Richard Dreyfuss adds a great perspective, and let's face it...the bus driver is nothing to sneeze at. A great message...love is usually where you least expect it. It's a keeper!"
3,Boring in Athens,Not near as good as My big fat greek wedding. No wonder this dog didn't make it to the big screen.
2,"Beautiful scenery, crassy storyline.","This movie features some breathtaking and beautiful scenery of Greece. Both of the ancient ruins and the current times. The premise of the film, a down on her luck nerdy history buff who suffers while taking more shallow tourists on tours could be funny, except that the movie starts to get crassy. The love stories are shallow and the comedy is almost funny. But not quite. There are worse movies out there, but also better ones."
4,Light hearted and fun,"I enjoyed this movie. The plot line isn't anything that will be remembered for millions of years but it is funny and gives you that happy feeling. Georgia is in Greece working as a tour guide after being laid off from the University she had taught at. She isn't the best tour guide and tends to bore her tourists with too many facts and not enough beaches. Her boss Maria decides that if Nikos, another tour guide gets Georgia to quit, he can have a raise. Nikos tries to sabotage Georgia and her group along the way. You meet a handful of supporting characters like Popi Cacas, Irv, Dorcas the clepto, etc that add to the charm of the story. You also get to see some amazing things in Greece, which was the original reason I watched this movie. Nia Vardalos is charming and pleasant as always."
5,My Life In Ruins Funny!,"I found this movie to be very enjoyable, as well as the comedy..It had a great story, good emotions and acting...Richard Dreyfuss was in usual form..older..but great...I liked the way the group of tourist became sort of a family and the tour guide learned a lot from them..Anyway..I would recommend it highly."
1,MISLEADING,"I should have read the other reviews.These designs are simply scanned from a printed version. They are not vector.The result is very poor quality - rough lines, occasionally broken lines, fuzzy, whatever the scan picked up or missed.What irritates me is that the cover is uses many of these designs and they are far sharper than any I can get, and I thought that was what I was getting.OK for playing around, but useless for professional work."
5,Simplicity and grace,"Although I have liked all of Tsukiyama's books, this is myfavorite. Her writing is sensory and subtle. It amazed me that shecould capture so well the differences between two Asian cultures insuch a small book. At the same time, she makes clear that those whotranscend differences and recognize their shared humanity are thetruly blessed."
5,One of my fave reads of 2000,"After reading most of the other reviews, I couldn't help but think that most were being too picky. A book can be a great read without having to be epic in nature. I thought this was one of the nicest ""stories"" I have read all year - mostly due to the characters. There was enough culture and history to set the stage but to go into anymore detail would have been beside the point...the point being the character's interaction. I have given this as gifts to 2 friends so far and plan to give to more when the opportunity arises. Enjoy the story - if you expect too much from books they may disappoint - accept this as a good read and enjoy the things you do learn and take with you from the book."
1,the samurai's garden,"I picked up the book because I was quite impressed with the rating. Now, I cannot help but assume they were scored by Ms. Tsukiyama's relatives or friends because this storyline was so shallow, it was painful to read. Believe me I tried but I gave up when the characters' conversations (with limited language skills) became unbelievable. Ms. Tsukiyama should have consulted expert linguists or translators prior to submitting her work. Throwing basic Japanese words didn't improve but worsened. By the time I read two mispelled words in the beginning of the book(genken for genkan, and dannasama instead of danasama) I knew this was heading in a bad direction."
5,Tranquility within turbulence.,"Even at the start of the book, it was simple to slip into the tale. There are no great action scenes, no dramatic entrances, just the calm events of lives mingling and friendships being built. Even so, there are events that will surprise you, and scenes that will touch you. I was taken to a time of Japan and China at war. At the same time, these events were only a backdrop for the story set to develop. The characters were all quite likeable, and had no trouble expanding as the story progressed. I also gained a deeper understanding of Japanese honor. An excellent lesson from a cultural standpoint, the book kept me interested and wishing for more. At the end, I was reminded of a similar experience I had when I was on exchange for two weeks in Japan. I wish there were a sequal to this story!"
3,Another alternate world based on rats?,"Luckily, I didn't pay for this one - I got it as a freebie at a convention. The storyline is convoluted and difficult to follow, and reads a bit like the main character was originally a favorite RPG hero and these are his escapades courtesty of a roleplaying weekend featuring a lot of delivered pizza and beer. I haven't read any other Keith Laumer, but I'm glad that other reviewers of this book say he has better works!"
3,Nashville City Blues,"Little to excite here,unfortunately.These songs are mostly lightweight in the Talley cannon.Not until cut#4,""Rough Edge"" can any serious toe-tapping be undertaken,and whilst ""Baby Needs Some Good Times"" and ""I've Seen The Bear""are pleasant enough,only""When I Need Some Love"",understated and elegant,and ""If It Wasn't For The Blues"" provide any vintage Talley.Diehards will have to have this,his recordings being so cherished,but newcomers would be better off going to the Woody Guthtrie tribute,Bear Family's 2on1 re-issue of his stunning first 2 LPs,and latter-day ""Touchstones"" & ""Journey"" for Talley's finest moments."
4,"LOVE ON A TWO WAY STREET, BY THE MOMENTS","If you are into the soul music of old, you will enjoy this cd. I happen to love the old soul. The songs are just as we remembered."
3,Lot of case studies,"Tons of case studies that explain the topics. However, don't cover basic concepts too well. Need some other reference points or things like instructor notes to fully understand the material in this book.If you are reading this book for school, better make sure your instructor provides good notes."
2,Nowhere near his best work,"Stanley Road was a superb album- no argument here. Having heard it I bought Heavy Soul as soon as it came out! One or two good songs, notably Peacock Suit and the title track itself are pretty hot. This fact annoyed me more because it shows how good Weller can be. Back to the drawing board methinks!!"
4,"Flows well, then grows on you","Really strong piece of work, different from Wildwood and Stanley Road with more electric guitar and bass/drums. A definate 4 / 4.5 disc, only a couple of ""weaker"" (i.e. repetitive) songs, but Brushed, Inspire You, and Peacock Suite are some of his strongest works. I also like Lean Into the Light quite a bit. If you're a fan of this highly-skilled musician, you really need this for your collection. This guy is way, way talented."
5,The extra bonus DVD to the Beatles Anthology DVD set,"Great care was put into creating this DVD and it is not a low budget hack some might fear. This is a top quality documentary made by some who made the Anthology DVDs with the help of people who were actually there. With this DVD you get a better understanding of the early years all presented in the entertaining style of the Beatles Anthology. A perfect bonus DVD to be put right next to the Anthology box set.Many 'only read about before' people, great stories, interesting facts, some never seen footage and pictures. Top release! Get it and have a wonderful 2+ hours. NOW the story is told. Thanks Pete, Roag etc..."
5,Passed my precal final because of this,I purchased one week prior to my precal final because I was having difficulty understanding some areas. The videos and text were extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend it to any student taking precal.
1,SHARK IS DEAD,"THIS TOY ONLY LIVED FOR 5 MINUTES AND MY ROTTWEILER PUP SAM ATE IT. SO I DON""T RECOMMEND THIS TOY FOR ANY DOG THAT CHEWS AND OR IS ROUGH WITH THEIR TOYS. THE STUFFING COMES RIGHT OUT."
4,Cute,My dog also heard this little toy and hi went for it..I package it and he went for it under the tree it tried to tear it like he does every Christmas and i said NO then he stayed away :)
2,"part brilliant , part boring","Have to agree w/ the last reviewer; glad I didn't spend 30 dollars either for this. Unless you weren't alive during most of the 80's, the music on disc 1 sounds like some lounge act rehashing songs that have faded from memory, which wasn't such a bad thing to begin with. Disc 2 is a much more entertaining,its experimental dance music w/ some winning results though I could have done w/o the tiki sounding ending. Buy this one only if you can get a discount,you may be finding yourself using disc 1 for a drink coaster like i did."
1,"M. Rakoskie, VA","There was not less than a star for rating or I would have given this book less. I have been trying to ""get into"" this book for two days. The characters' vocabulary is too difficult to imagine people using. It is a difficult read and I am quitting at page 70."
5,Willie Nelson- Spirit,"Willie Nelson's albums are great to follow a theme, I love albums that don't jump around with a hodgepodge of different kinds of music. This album tells a story of love lost without any curve balls thrown. I'd definitely call this one a ""keeper""."
5,Great product,"I bought this product 6 months ago. It is great. Easy to clean, sturdy and looks great!!!"
4,Great Gift; no LEDs,"This flashlight/pocketknife combo set is a handsome gift. I bought six to give to the men in my family for Christmas, and everyone seemed pleased. Both items are small, but very well made--good value for less than $10, especially since the set comes with batteries. The only caveat that I see: the conventional flashlight, rather than the newfangled LED bulbs that are now available. Set would deserve 5 stars if the LED flashlight was available, but it would also be more expensive. Overall, I am pleased and would buy it again."
1,sorry - rita - but this movie is a piece of s.....,"the most terrible movie i have ever seen with absolutely nothinginteresting to see except poor rita hayworth ending her career in such a soft-porn totaly crazy end of sixties movie...the movie looks like they made it with a hand-camera...why did they put this movie on dvd ? we are still waiting for classics like blood and sand, salome, trinidad and tonight and every night instead !!!!"
1,Did nothing for me...,"Having listened to Prog-rock for a long time, I was duped by this disc. The other reviewers praised this disc/band to no end. I strongly disagree with all of them. Either a band grabs my attention or they don't, after two complete listenings I still wasn't impressed. Perhaps I would like one of their other discs, maybe not. Proof that everyone doesn't see eye to eye concerning which bands are prog-rock. Oh well, it won't be the first or the last time that I blew my money."
4,Highly enjoyable and entertaining!,"Reads more like a compilation of short stories. Tying the stories together is the title character, Yolanda Garcia. We get to know Yo thru the people in her life...the mother, the cousin, the teacher-mentor, the best friend, etc. As the reader you get a sense of who she is and who she will become. If only we could see ourselves as others see us. Good book!"
5,Wonderfully entertaining and highly readable in other words,I couldn't put this book down. Yo is a person I know I would get along with. She is fun and she is intelligent - this is a must in my book. She is also extremely sensitive and gentle. Julia Alvarez makes me want to live her life. She is an author that I will recommend highly in my library. High school students should all read this and know the life that immigrant children have. Wonderful. Julia - keep writing. As your father said it is your gift to us. Thank you.
5,ineeka organic tea,"I love good tea, and I thought this rated up there with some of the best. I like the Himalayan black tea. I bought it at Whole Foods and I was looking to find it for less. It looks as though Whole Foods has the best price out there."
5,Ineeka Himalayan Black,"This is a remarkable tea, especially when steeped with very pure water and taken neat. The scent alone is a great pleasure. It is, however, also insanely expensive. It is great for a very special yet inexpensive gift--since the price of a single unit is just under $10--but making a habit of drinking it would being one up a bit short . . . of funds. Remember, it is almost $160 per pound."
3,Competition ID numbers,Numbers were acturately described and were received in a very timely fashion. Very good supplier. Only mistake that I made was going with the paper stock numbers. The numbers were used for IDing players at a baseball tryout. They were to be used several times for several evaluations. The paper stock numbers did not hold up well for this type of evaluation process. Next time I will purchase the more robust tyvek numbers.
5,good stuff,"Monsters Are Waiting may be one of the biggest bands to come out of Los Angeles this year. They have been touring heavily on the west coast. They have become regulars at Spaceland, the Troubadour, and Popscene in San Francisco. I recently saw them at Popscene and they totally wowed the audience. This record is an expanded version of a self-released EP from last year. There are three extra songs. This is a great album from a band that I expect to be really big very soon. Monsters Are Waiting are a combination of glamour, new wave, and intelligent pop music. They only have to do more tours of the East Coast and the UK, and let more people find out about them. If this band went to the UK, things would explode. Monsters Are Waiting are a band to get into."
5,"Good, I see where Maddox is coming from.","I did enjoy reading this for many reasons. This is a very realistic and entertaining novel. The ideas put forth do have deep impact, I am impressed. For some this is a suspense detective who did it novel, for others its a powerful message. I say yes to Mad Light, it will surprise you, get a copy and enjoy it."
1,Buyer Beware,I ordered these through the Coca Cola store. On there they were advertised as 16 oz but were 12 oz glasses. So beware they may be smaller than they actually are.
1,"Never received item after reported shipment. Seller, in my opinion should consider other form of shipment of items sold.","I never received my order from the seller. My first message to seller regarding my order not arriving went unanswered. The second message I sent to the seller was quickly answered after the seller was informed by me that I was considering filing a dispute. My money was refunded. Seller should in my opinion, consider another means of shipping items and pay better attention to messages sent to them and establish a follow-up policy for shipments sent out to buyers. The seller stated that they never saw my first message."
2,lacking,I was very dissapointed in this book. I am from New England and I thought this book would contain ideas for new locations to photograph foliage. There is almost no text of interest and the photographs are lacking. A few of them were nice but none of them blew me away.
5,Newman and Woodward - what else can you ask for?,"TERRIFIC movie - Newman and Woodward sizzled. My husband and I watch this and we both think it's one of the best romantic yet gritty movies ever made. Each character/actor is a gem and the story is timeless. The only one I might like more is Cat on a Hot Tin Roof with Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor. Same genre - great performances, great scripts, family realities."
4,Love 'em! just have had some issues tho...,"Buying my fourth pair in ten yrs. I'm in the sun a lot, fishing, etc. The polaroid lens are amazing, can see thru clear or murky water. The fit is great, and have gotten tons of compliments. The only problem I've encountered is that i leave them on my dash when not wearing them. Lense popped out of first well worn pair. 2nd pair, rubber nose pieces turned soft and left black marks on nose. 3rd pair, somehow hinge got rust on it and broke. Dont know if that was just a fluke, hoping so since i'm buying my fourth pair. I recommend these to anyone who spends time outdoors. Just keep them out of the sun when not wearing."
1,Sorry I bought it,"I agree with the other reviewer who said, ""This book takes one chapter and stretched it into a whole book. It's drawn out. Boring to read and seems to reitirate stuff over and over again..."" Illustrations of the points being made are necessary."
2,So So,This book takes one chapter and stretched it into a whole book.It's drawn out. Boring to read and seems to reitirate stuff over and over again...
4,Good Value,"I've bought two other Benson compilations but I think this is the best collection on the market. With 2 discs, this is good value for the money and it covers a lot of ground; from his early CTI recordings (nothing from the Verve period, however) to his better known hits (""Breezin'"" and ""This Masquerade"") from the late 70s Warner era. If you haven't heard his version of ""White Rabbit"", don't wait any longer; mighty fine guitar playing and a very interesting composition."
4,Neat speakers,"When you look at their size, they are the size of a CD jewel case, you would think they can't be that good. But these speakers are great. The sound is awesome. Of course, you wouldn't expect a great sound in a large room, but for a small office or bedroom they are fantastic. The only problem is the unit which connects the 2 speakers. This contains the on switch and batteries. If you forget to shut the switch off you drain your batteries rather quickly and it is easy to do this at first. Otherwise the speakers are great and quite portable."
4,Mediocre sound but excellent portability,"(NOTE: the USB cable for the SI-5 is sold separately. Sonic Impact Technologies Gen2 is basically the same speaker but it comes with a USB cable.) The sound from these speakers is mediocre at best: lots of midrange, very little bass. They sound like cheap car speakers. However, I teach classes and like to start the day with some music, and these speakers are perfect for quiet background music from my PC. If your music software has an EQ, increase the volume on your PC to the max, keep the speaker volume at 5, boost the bass EQ a little, cut the mid EQ a lot, and boost the treble EQ a lot. They'll sound ok at low volume, and they're so small and light won't even notice you have them in your luggage."
4,A great cinematic debut for Schnabel,"BASQUIAT is a wonderful film about one artist made by another.Even if both of them are overstated and hyped up, they must be heard. This film gives us a chance to experience their artistic vision.The film is visually beautiful. Wright's performance is subtle yet precise. After seeing some documentary footage, I could hardly tell the difference between the real Basquiat and the actor. So, bravo!!! The rest of the cast is at their usual best.Although this film focuses on New York art scene and on Basquiat as an artist, it also raises serious issues without being preachy. For instance, when asked during his first exhibition whether he considers himself a black artist, Basquiat (who was of a mixed racial heritage) replies to the man: ""Do you consider yourself a writer or a white writer?"" I think that sums up Basquiat's views about race and about art: he was an artist first and everything else second.I hope Schnabel keeps on directing."
1,Hype becomes Art,Jean-Michel Basquiat laughed himself all the way to the bank ... er -- his heroin connexion.
4,"An actor's movie, maybe","Jeffery Wright is, of coure, excellent as Basquiat, but the revelation is in seeing David Bowie as Andy Warhol. OK maybe not a revelation, but a funny, stony experience. Not really written, so much as just there, this movie has all the plot of one of Basqiat's paintings. It's more about essence than story. Which doesn't bother me one bit. And the movie is dripping with essence."
3,Needs More Salt,"Being a fan of Depeche Mode, I gave this a try...and well....it's ok. It has some good songs like Bottle Living and Dirty Sticky Floors, Stay and I Need You are close seconds. The lyrics can be Martin Gore inspired sometimes and Vince Clarke other times. It's a good first album, but I'll be expecting something special next time.I'd prefer to listen to any DM albums or Martin Gore albums over this and usually do, but there are times when I do want to listen to it, but not very many."
1,Like trash? Come to the right place.,"Besides Kim Cattrall's t*ts, no reason to watch. Unless you like to see women sit around and whine, and whine about men. Oh, did I mention they sit and whine a lot? ""Oh jeez, Ted won't return my phone calls."",""Yesterday I broke a nail, I need consolement."" Things of that nature. I know that sounds like tons of excitement but... it's not."
5,Great season 4,"I finally got this set for a great price on Amazon. That way I can watch the whole season 4 from the beginning to end, since I saw them out of order originally. The DVD got here quick and in great shape."
2,Weak adaptation,"This is a very weak adaptation of a novel by the splendid writer Donald Westlake. It's largely an action film for teens, falling very short on dialogue with a plot that hinges on a hypnotism bit that is wholly unbelievable. The actors are competent and the music, by Quincy Jones and a half dozen of Hollywood's finest musicians, is often interesting and distinctive. While billed as a ""hilarious comedy,"" I was unable to muster even a smile let alone a laugh. Mostly this long, long film is a bore."
4,Interesting,This book is a nice look back at where we came from . . . and where we are headed. It was very enjoyable and shipped promptly.
2,Disappointing and depressing...,"When I saw the cover for this movie, even as a romance, when I think of techno music, I think of a good time...a fun spirited movie. And I'm also an Abbie Cornish fan. I was so disappointed after the first 20 minutes, I was about to shut it off. But since I bought it, I fast forwarded through the rest of it, stopping at times to get even more depressed. Despite the music, which I recommend only buying the soundtrack, it is one of the most misrepresented movie covers I have read. What appears to be a fun, love filled movie is exactly the opposite. It should be renamed as 'Our Horrible Lives'. There was absolutely no perfect days in this movie."
3,Funny Book by a Terribly Funny Woman,"I found myself laughing throughout this wonderfully funny book, however it would have been considerably funnier preformed. Clinton is among my favorite Comediennes, and proves again to have an inteligent wit. The book drags in places, however, when tone and motion are simply necissary additions. So I recomend having someone read this to you while adding tone to their voice and motion to their bodies! Or simply watch her live or listen to one of her CDs."
3,Not As Funny As I Had Hoped,"I first saw Kate Clinton on ""Out Loud and Laughing"" and found her extremely hilarious. I found her topics in her comedy to be something I could really relate to, as well as her dry, sarcastic wit that was applied to every single comment, almost as sinful as buttered popcorn. I had been looking forward to this book for a long, long time.Imagine my surprise when I read the book and hardly laughed, but more importantly, had to FORCE my way to get to the end. It was a difficult read not because of the language or the topics, but because I didn't care about what she had to say. It seemed too wordy, as if there wasn't any real point she was trying to make, but that she had to fulfill her 60,000 word contract deal.I had better hopes for Ms. Clinton's book and hope that if she releases another one, she has a goal in mind; namely, a point."
4,One of Jimmy's best,"Jimmy Stewart turns in an amazing performance and makes what would otherwise be a forgetable movie an unforgetable movie. Stewart is my all-time favorite actor, but part-way into this movie I was wondering why the other characters don't just leave him in the desert (of course, they can't, that's the story). When he triumphs, I was thinking: yeah, Jimmy probably really could have done that."
3,True Grit,"One of James Stewarts finest performances. My family loved James Stewart and my dad loved airplanes so there was no doubt we would see this when it was released. The whole family enjoyed it. Some scenes were a little rough for my sister so I don't recommend for small children. A movie about survival long before reality TV. Several men are stranded in the desert after their transport plane crashes from engine trouble. They must devise a way to survive the local killer tribesmen, the heat, and escape. Great performances from a veteran cast. If you like films without a great deal of scenery that take a hard look at personalities, like ""Twelve Angry Men"" you will enjoy this movie."
4,"Great film--was surprised I liked the remake better, though!","It's a little Man against Nature and Man against Man when a flight of men are stranded in the desert after their plane experiences engine trouble in a sand storm. Will they make it out alive? They try to send two men to find help. They try to negotiate for help with the locals. Finally, they realize their only hope is to cobble their broken airplane back together with the aid of poorly socialized genius. Will they get it off the ground? Will they even survive long enough to try? This is a wonderful story with a lot of heart. Jimmy Stewart as their aging pilot, Captain Townes, is wonderful. Highly recommended, but watch the new one as well. I think they did the original justice!"
4,High adventure in the desert,"Jimmy Stewart gives a great performance in this film, which revolves around an oil company's air transport and the desperate plan the survivors come up with to escape the unforgiving Sahara desert. Stewart plays the pilot of the plane who must work with an egomaniacal model airplane designer to create a new, working plane from the wreckage of the old twin-boomed Flying Boxcar.This film has a lot to say for it: an international cast, a good plot, inner turmoil, interPERSONAL turmoil, etc. The only thing I would have done differently is I would have given the monkey more screen time."
3,good movie,I enjoyed the movie. It is interesting to watch the differing styles of leadership at work. I am not a big fan of old movies but I found this one to be rather enjoyable.
2,Engine Misfire,"Here is a film project that should have been a lot better than it is. The plot about a small group of plane crash victims trying to cobble together their aircraft again is compelling enough, but director Robert Aldrich, like novelist Ellston Trevor in his original work, clutters it up with a lot of pointless and contrived subplots. There is an especially compelling performance by Ian Bannen that is worthy of note. If everybody had followed his lead and lightened up on the melodrama the result would have been more memorable."
1,very poor quality,"unfortunately is a shoddy article, I put on my honda accord on a new radiator, and in less than 15 days began to let out the water pressure, after some tests,this cap could not resisted more than 8 psi of pressure. so it must return the old cap and the problem was solved."
4,Absorbent.,"This towel has a different texture than a standard Terrycloth towel.They are very absorbent,compared with other towels i have tried that were considered to be kitchen towels.Nice size also...some kitchen towels are a bit small."
5,Great product!,I checked local stores for kitchen towels as well and found none that were this high of quality and this price. Great quality and thickness and a great price !
1,If you want to push water around,These towels are not very absorbent at all. Not a good feature for a kitchen towel.
3,"Quality towels, colors not as shown","The towels were good quality, and a nice value, but the colors were not as shown. We got 2 white towels and 1 red check. In the photo, it shows 3 different designs. We'll keep them though since it was a good deal."
2,Not Impressed!,"After reading the other reviews I happily ordered these towels. What I received was not what I expected. The towels are lightweight and have numerous ""pulls"" in the terry cloth. I haven't used them yet because I need to wash them first. Little known fact: any textile (including clothing) that comes into the US from another country is sprayed with pesticides before it clears customs. Always check the label and wash first!"
1,Once is enough,"I didn't realize that these towels were from China, but should have. I wish Amazon would post country of origin on the catalog page. My problem with these towels is that they fade and shrink. The directions state to wash in WARM water. How can one wash kitchen towels in warm water and expect them to be clean? Ever heard of grease in a kitchen? Tumble dry on low? I don't think so. It's no big deal, but I do expect kitchen stuff to be tough, not needing extra special care.Update. Three months has gone by and the towels have faded to yucky colors even with special care. I changed my rating to one star."
3,Coby MP3 Player,A little hard to use. Has been impossable to find accesories for. Ear buds get tangled
1,Not Vista compatible - Beware!,"3 months after returning this card and the manufacturer advising they would have Amazon update the site, I still don't see a warning that this is a card not compatible with Vista. Perhaps they have published new drivers to handle Vista - but CHECK THEIR WEB SITE BEFORE YOU BUY."
1,Lousy service,Item failed to perform. No help from Belkin. Contacted Amazon about return and was informed I had to deal with Computer Brain who informed me I had to pay return freight plus 15% restocking fee for an item that was faulty. Never buy from Amazon again
3,Shallow but enjoyable book on Zen and Asian Martial Arts,"Joe Hyams is not a great martial arts master, or a Zen Roshi. His book is rather glib regarding Zen practice or the martial arts. Yet this doesn't mean it's worthless.""Zen in the Martial Arts"" is a little collection of vignettes from Hyams' own training under various martial arts masters in the 50's and 60's, including Bruce Lee, among others. He discusses lessons in concentration, visualization, and various Zen techniques that he recieved from the masters he studied with, and observations he made in their lessons. Hyams is easy to read and inspiring, like a typical new-age motivational writer.If you're looking for something enjoyable and provocative to read on an airplane flight, this will do nicely. If you're looking for a serious book on Zen or the Martial Arts, however, look elsewhere."
5,Must read!,"I couldn't put it down, once I started reading it. It is an excellent introduction for anyone beginning their martial journey."
3,Entertaining,This is a light and easy read. The philosophy portrayed in this book is interesting particularly as it pertains to Bruce Lee.
4,Great!,"I really liked this book, i gave it to everyone of my friends to read. i have one friend that hates reading and he read it the whole way through. Its because its such an interesting subject. I say whoever wants more out of martial arts, and whoever doesnt want to just be perfroming dance moves, empty your cup and give this book a try."
4,Top Love-Drama Soap Opera,"To bad this movie is not available in Germany. I'm not a Paul Newman fan but I was curious about after I bought many months ago the fantastic soundtrack von Elmer Bernstein on CD (by FSM).Well, its really a top drama about love, marriage, affairs, with top actors like JoAnne Woodward und Paul Newman.They was already married together in the real live (from 29 January 1958 - 26 September 2008 ""his death"")In glorius decors, beautiful costumes, fantastic photographed in Cinemascope!Trivia: in a small role you can see Barbara Eden and in a uncredited part as ""Messenger"" David Macklin who played in the Episode ""The Blood line"" of ""Bonanza"" Todd Grayson.The Picture quality looks great, sharp, clear. Soundtrack in 4-Channel-Stereo. English subtitle available. DVD Code: 1"
3,You've come a long way baby,"It stuck out like a sore thumb to me, a woman, but did anyone else take note of the scene where Paul Newman makes the big speech in the conference room to all the law partners? I mean it was so obviously indicative of the culture at the time. EVERY SINGLE PERSON sitting at that table was a white male (elderly variety mostly). In fact I think even all their suits were pretty much identical. Not a single woman or person of color in the entire room. That pretty much sums up what has changed in the past 52 years."
3,Silly but enjoyable,"It's not ""The Long, Hot Summer"" (which is a towering achievement in cinematic trash, and one of my favorite movies), but ""From the Terrace"" is fun. As with every other 50's organization man novel adapted to the screen, it bears only a tenuous relationship to the original book, but in that case this is a good thing. First, O'Hara's writing is turgid, self-important pulp, and second, the story is about a total loser. No one goes to a Paul Newman movie to see the story of a pathetic dweeb, and they won't see one here, either. He's flawed but heroic, and he and Woodward look like a million bucks. The movie ends a little less than halfway through the book, but you can't tell."
4,impressive,It's unbelievable to see a story like this based on true events! The movie keeps you with your eyes wide open all the time. There are some strong images that keeps your skin as a chicken!
2,BORED OUT OF MY MIND,"I followed this one for about 15 minutes but the acting was below par. Not horrible, just below par and why should I put up with that because people are promising it will be some engaging horror later? If the acting sucks try to make it campy at least but this was trying to be serious and it just wasn't working. WHEN WATCHED: end of April 2011; MY GRADE: C minus."
2,Strange Movie,This was a strange movie. Like The Exorcism meets Fire in the Sky if you have some time to kill and nothing else to do give it a try.
2,Authenticity is irrelevant - it stinks,"I don't care about the veracity of the film - as a piece of movie making, it smells like Alfred Hitchcock's socks.I do not know the director's credentials but, regardless of whether he's responsible for Gone With The Wind or Jaws XXI, he did a poor job on this one. Whirling the camera around a stationary actor isn't wizardry. In fact, it's annoying. So is the technique of having characters whisper. This may be groovy when you see a film in a quiet theater, but when you're at home and coping with planes flying overhead, the dishwasher, a dog snoring and other distractions, WHISPERING SUCKS.With too many plot inconsistencies to enumerate, poor acting by most, and no gratuitous nudity (it's Milla Jovovich, ya know!), this experience could only be made better by downing enough vodka to forget you've seen it.PS - I suggest The Fifth Kind; that's when aliens rob you of 1 hour 45 minutes, and the cost of one movie rental. The horror!"
2,ANOTHER OVER RATED JUNK!!!!,"This junk is soooooo over rated like that other flick was ""paranormal activities"" for me was boring, both sucked & over rated!!With that spilt screen like u watching one of the TV fox show ""24"" seriesIs same o paste over and over with unbelievable B.S roll up together don't make any sense ,it was stupid! C"
2,Cool Concept,"The background for the movie seems amazing. However i think there was a lot lacking from the actors, and I think they tried to make it more ""real"" by doing a sort of Blair witch rendition and then reenactment over top, which in my opinion made it seem kinda ridiculous. The insertion of clips messed with the flow of the movies unfolding events."
5,Great movie to the open minded,"It is sad to see that most bad reviews were written by people who thought this movie was real at the beginning but then after doing research found out it was not.Wake up people is like me saying Twilight Saga is horrible because Vampires and werewolves are not real. The Twilight Saga is bad... just because it does.This movie is great. You have to be open minded.Acting is great. The whole plot was excellent. But perhaps too complicated to those who are simple minded.My advice is people should read more, educate themselves. The world has a lot to offer, open your eyes. Walmart is not the only place to do shopping shop."
1,you want a review? i cannot give you a review because i am still waiting for the movie,"i cannot give you a review of something that has not arrive jet, its taking to long, where is my movie?when you are going to sent it? what's taking so long?"
5,One Of My Favorites!,Absolutely Loved It!I have trouble finding books myself in the library. That's why I only read recommended books. It came time when my teacher told us to choose a book ourselves. I thought I'd flunk the report because I knew I'd hate the book. But the moment I picked up the book I loved it!
5,"Really, really, real.","This is the anti-sitcom book--rather than earth-shaking problems being resolved in half an hour, minus ads, this books shows the conflicts between Ant and the adults around her clearly and realistically, and begins the resolution process imperfectly and honestly. Ant feels she has to lie to get any notice in her family. Ant's Mom and Dad are fed up with lieing and refuse, then, to listen or give Ant any attention, positive or negative, unless she had said something so outrageous it cannot be let go. Circular conflicts that feed on each other are realistically and thouroughly portrayed in this phenominal first novel by Gennifer Choldenko. A great book for discussion groups, too!"
3,Interesting Movie,"In my opinion UnDiscovered was a good movie. I will say that there was not much to the plot of the movie and it lacked any real twists or suspenseful suprises. However the creators did an excellent job of capturing the fast paced lifestyle and struggles of many musicians. I would highly reccomend this movie to two demographics of the population... young teenage girls that enjoy drama and people who are involved in show business or people who have experienced that ""fast-paced"" lifestyle.(it will give you laughs and smiles as you see resemblences to people you know and parties you've lived.)"
1,idk,"I have never seen this movie before, but i don't like to let other peoples reveiws to get in my way of seeing a movie i would like to see. Reveiws are nothing, but normal peoples thoughts. Why not go and see the movie for yourself and find out. I guess it's hard to tell it i will like it or not because people say it stinks and it stunk more than Ashlee Simpson on SNL!!! Thats surprising!! Idk what to do hear."
1,"'UNDISCOVERED', we should be so lucky!!!","WHERE IS THE 0 RATING? ANYWAY, I'M BEING NIE BY GIVING THIS MOVIE 1 STAR, HERE IS IN THE NICEST WAY POSSIBLE, HERE IS MY REVIEW:REEKS!STUPID!BRAINLESS GARBAGE!LET ME SAY THIS ASHLEE SIMPSON WAS BETTER ON SNL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! GO TO THE DENTIST INSTEAD AND HAVE SOME TEETH PULLED W/O NOVAICANE. THEN, SQUIRT LEMON JUICE IN YOUR EYES, AND EVEN THAT IS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TORTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bring your Nycule!!,"You use this time of your life to get a snooze, then agian...don't just wait for about 15 mins.(if even that) and wait for this movie to put you to sleep."
1,Stinks,"Go slam your head in a car door. You'll enjoy yourself alot more, than sitting through this junk."
2,Undiscovered is a Bit Unimpressive.,"Pell James and Steven Strait: Two pretty people with no chemistry.Ashlee Simpson: Actually surprisingly likeable considering it's her.Kip Pardue: The most interesting and likeable thing about this entire flick.Soundtrack: Not too bad, but it isn't my cup of tea despite some strong INXS resemblance.The Plot: Slow, predictable, and at times really silly. Pell James is pretty, but she looks like any other girl her age, and Steven Strait is trying too hard to be a universally liked Johnny Depp.My rating: Imagine the sound of the buzzer after three wrong guesses on Family Feud. Sorry, you guys, but this movie just wasn't worth the five bucks I spent when I bought it off the previously viewed rack."
2,Take your brain out before watching this movie.,"In a few words, ""stupid but fun"". That's exactly how this movie is. The beginning alone was worth it, just because of all the cameos. I was surprised to see someone like James Caan in a movie like this."
3,Very Bad Santa,"If you thought Billy Bob-Thorton was Bad Santa.. you thought wrong!! My guess is that this is a horror/comedy but I would say its more comedy than horror.. there are more tears of laughter than drops of blood. Frankly there is very little blood and no gore. So if you are in it for blood and guts dont bother. I honestly didnt know what to expect and, if you ask me the violence alone wasnt enough to make an R rating.. its the shocking laugauge (which I thought was funny) and the female nudity. Personally I think its funny to listen to senior citizens use the f-word. The whole storyline is ludicrous but, what do you expect with this kinda idea? I think its meant to be exactly what it is ..absurd fun!!"
2,SANTA'S SLAY DVD REVIEW,"Looking at the DVD display box, I thought that this movie was going to be a really bad horror film but it really turned out to be a comedy with minimum laughs. Casting Goldberg for Santa Claus was pretty funny too. Watching the beginning of this movie I was shocked to see James Caan, Chris Kattan, Rebecca G. and Fran Dresher. The beginning for me was the funniest especially when Santa(Goldberg) kicks the dog in the fan.Overall, I say it's worth watching once."
3,Webcam,This product didnt work well with the Laptop so I gave to other people that was said it was okay
4,Worked for my use,"I bought this to cut up and use in a robot vision project. The camera itself works well, and that's what I wanted."
2,Yet another repackaging of the Blue Note material,"The material on this collection is good, but it is just another repackaging of Blue Note's rather limited Miles Davis catalog. I recommend any of the albums this material is culled from before this themeless collection. Pick up ""Birth of the Cool"", ""Miles Davis Volume One"", ""Miles Davis Volume Two"", or Cannonball Adderley's ""Something Else"" instead. All four are available as a boxed set, too."
4,A video history of Jethro Tull,Enjoying this very much. Only disappointment is that there wasn't more of it. Some of their best albums are hardly even mentioned.A very nice addition to your Tull collection and for anyone interested in progressive rock.
2,Cone Boobs!,"While I must admit that this bra was very supportive, it made my boobs look like cones. I ordered it because I was excited about all the great reviews but when it arrived and I tried it on I could only giggle at myself. I showed my husband and he laughed too. I sent it back. I'm a 42H so maybe that's why they seemed so silly looking. I bit the bullet and paid for more Le Mystere bras which seem to be the only ones that give me the support AND shape that I like."
4,This bra is very comfortable,I found this bra to be very comfortable. I liked the wide staps. The only problem i have is the cup seems to be a little to big. I still love this bra.
4,ol faithful,I have been purchasing this model of Goddess bra for years. I love the coverage and support it gives. I'm a 38H and was so excited to see it here on amazon for half the price I pay for it in a speciality bra store which is great on my wallet.
5,Mine Work Well,"I have two; buying a third. Cheap, effective solution. One is on a lamp that was inexpensive and I was afraid I would wear out the switch, so I use this product instead. Second is on an older-generation external hard-drive. I am purchasing another one for my HP laser printer that doesn't have an off switch! Well, it will now. Control!"
5,TlcprnIA,"This book has been a standard for Sunday morning breakfasts cooked by my Father. The Sourdough Pancakes have always been my personal favorite. However, he has covered the cookbook by good use as well as splatter. The spine is broken in several places and it is held together by a rubber band. I just can't imagine buying him a new one, because the book has been marked in batter, butter and love for the last 25+ years."
4,querry about my satisfaction with radiator,this part was ; ldifferent than the one i took out but i managed to make it work there was an extra hole in the tank once i figured out the plug situation everything was fine
2,Perhaps if you are Catholic...,"Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her."
3,It is not closed-captioned,"I'm disappointed that Amazon.com listed this item as closed-captioned under format field which is incorrect. I already sent correction to Amazon.com. I also am disappointed with A&E; not including caption or subtitle for this biography.The biography on this DVD runs like VHS, no menus, anything like that except it will go back to the beginning every time you stop playing. Not convenient. Good luck on fast forwarding or rewinding to exact location you are looking for."
4,Very Good Condition,The book was received in a very good condition. It was packaged well and arrived earlier than expected. I was very happy with the condition of the book and the service provided. I will shop again through Amazon.com when I need any product available through this service.
2,Songs listed for this cd are not the same as are on the actual cd,"The songs listed for this CD were not acurate. My grandaughter wanted it for the song ""Need to Feel Loved"" (which was listed)When we received the CD the pkg. looked the same so she opened it, then discovered that song + others listed were not thesame. The list was only partially correct. Since it appeared the same and was opened it cannot be returned. I am highlydissipointed."
1,Horrible Product. Well...at least it stuck to my fridge!!!,"The magnets suck. They aren't strong enough. I tested it on my fridge, and stuck pretty well. But when I went to put it on my vehicle it wouldn't stick anywhere underneath the car only on the top which defeats the purpose of hiding it if I can only keep it on the exterior parts of my car. So I rated this as a bad product. I only spent five-dollars for the thing, and to me, it's not worth going through the trouble to return it. But I suggest going elsewhere, and find a better product. I really wish I would have known the strength of the magnets and how many there were because there are only two small magnets. And even if they we're strong, I'd hate risk losing my spare keys while driving. So all in all, this product isn't the best please go elsewhere!!!!"
4,"Great Music, Great Performance, Poor Mastering","This disc contains some incredible choral works, performed by one of the nation's best collegiate choirs. The music is brilliantly written and well performed, and based on those qualities alone I would easily give this CD a five-star rating.Unfortunately, the sound quality is not up to the standards I expect from a commercial disc. The music, like most choral compositions, contains a very wide dynamic range, and there is discernable audio clipping during the loud passages on nearly every track.Don't get me wrong, this is a truly enjoyable disc, and a must-have for any Whitacre fan, especially since there is no other recording of the complete a cappella works available. However, the poor mastering reduces my enjoyment of this recording from a five to a four."
1,How to put together a kit,This book tells you how to put a kit together. It has nothing to do with building a street rod from an actual Ford Car. The title misrepresents the contents.
1,"Key word left off title - Ford ""Fiberglass"" Street Rod","Nice photos etc. However, the detail is no more than what you would find if you've read any of the major magazines like Street Rodder, Rod & Custom and others. If you are brand new to the hobby or are building a fiberglass rod (and I have nothing against a glass car) it is a fine book. If you are looking for something that explains the problem areas of a steel car, how to avoid or overcome issues with a body or frame that is over 70 years old, this book is a total waste of money and time. I did find an acceptable use for the book instead of returning it, the 14 year old kid down the street was very interested in my newly acquired 40 Ford Coupe, he thought the book was a wonderful gift so it worked well as promotion of the hot rodding culture."
4,"INFO ON ""300 SPARTANS"" DVD?","I write a DVD column for the Desert Post Weekly (Palm Springs). A number of readers asked about the insert in current DVDs from Fox Home Video that announced 300 SPARTANS as a ""New on DVD"" release. Here's what Shari Rosenblum at Fox had to say:""The 300 Spartans is being released by Fox Home Entertainment in the future, but we have not made an official announcement regarding a street date. It will likely come out as part of a Father's Day promotion this year, but again, we have no official release date to confirm at this time.""Update: the DVD has been released and it is a fine looking transfer of a solid, heroic story done on a limited budget."
1,300 Spartans . . . and hardly one will be missed,"Given the quality of the main cast, the number of extras engaged, and the storyline, it's hard to see how this film could fail in its purpose. But like the real 300, it does. At first glance it has the look of an expensive epic. Yet, despite the presence of Richard Egan and Sir Ralph Richardson and an assortment of usually proficient actors, it's a lacklustre enterprise, ranging from the wooden to the excessively theatrical, an unintentional parody of history. In a film this bad, being bumped off early on must have been a relief. The theme music redeems the effort in part, for one star."
1,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dull, slow, and seemingly interminable, The 300 Spartans is a leaden war film with awful battle scenes (watch the extras try to catch the spears to their chests to make it appear they were hit by them), campy acting and turgid direction; while the more recent 300 was no classic, it's certainly more entertaining than this stinker of a film."
4,very nice,"I was looking for a DVD rack that was small that could hold what DVDs I had. so I saw this product and I seemed to fit. It was small, its was a good price compared to other DVD racks that were bigger or smaller. The part that I loved the most was that you push the DVD and it pops out at you."
4,celtic woman the greastest journey,the first dvd would stop but the second one is okthe was great like it said
3,Idea-Generator,"I'd have to agree with the one-star rating as far as the actual specs for the various materials, suitability and etc. In that way, definitely a disappointment. From the idea-generating angle, though, I think it is good for keeping possibilities in view, rather than focusing solely on what is the ""must-have"" of the year. The Safety and Environment listing is helpful as well. Still, it might be more productive to go on that field trip to Home Depot, provided you're not looking for unusual solutions. It is a pricey thing, though, so buy it used or get one on loan."
4,Decadence is beautiful,"This is a beautiful black and white movie with beautiful people. Its undisputed star, Italian actress Lucia Bose, plays exactly the same character like in Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Cronada di un amore"" - a dissatisfied egotistical trophy wife of a captain of industry and trade. The noirish plot (cover up of an accident by the Bose character and her lover) gets a political slant as the distracted lover, a mathematician shoved into a position at university by influential relatives, does not pay attention to a woman student and let her fail at an exam. This leads to (comparatively tame) student riots in which the (stunningly well groomed) students ask for the lover's head. The dissatisfaction with social conditions in Spain of the 1950 permeates this movie. The settings in wintry Madrid (and surroundings) will haunt the viewer for a long time. The final scenes are pretty campy but the overall impression is a good one."
5,How do they keep getting better?,"This is their best album yet, and that (to me) is saying something. This is a much ""freer"" album. I mean that it's just all over the map - they go from growl, to Tool-sounding, to acoustic, to super-heavy, to really melodic.. and that's just within one song. This is just a much more creative album. It's also more technical than previous albums too. Somehow this band has managed to take my ""#1 band"" spot away from Dream Theater - and I haven't looked back. Well, I still check in to see when they have a new album coming out. But still - this is an excellent, excellent album."
1,I SEE NO TALENT,"First of all im not a kid just too lazy to make a profile .I dont care if its old school death metal,black metal <metalcore,or mallcore crap i just take music for what it is .this cd is by the way extremely boring they have no good wide range of vocals .by the in flames and as i lay dying suck!!!"
3,Disappointment from a long time fan.,"Unfortunately, other than the opener, most of the songs on Ghost Reveries sound old and tired to this reviewer who had thoroughly digested all of Opeth's previous work.Many of the riffs, (especially the most notable main riff of The Grand Conjuration, which comes from BWP's title track) sound re-hashed. There is very little in the way of truly original stuff, apart from your usual progressive fare which sounds much less fresh than it did on previous works.Most grating is that many tracks are laced with meaningless progressive segments, ruining the flow of the song and making it essentially more of a prog album than a metal album.In fact, given that 3 of the tracks here are totally acoustic with clean vocals, and that the other typical Opeth tracks feature more than their usual amount of clean interludes, I must balk at even calling this metal. This is really prog rock with some harsh vocals and cliched sounding death metal riffs."
1,MY BROKEN DRIVER,FOR CHRISTMAS I RECIEVED A JOHN DALY 500CC DRIVER. I COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY IT OUT. SO FINALLY ONE 50 DEGREE DAY IN MARCH I TOOK IT TO THE DRIVING RANGE. AFTER A DOZEN GOLF BALLS THE CLUB'S FACE BENT INTO THE DRIVER. I HAVE A CHEAP 15 DOLLAR K-MART DRIVER THAT I USED FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND IS STILL IN MINT SHAPE. JOHN DALY DOES NOT USE HIS CLUB ON THE TOUR BECAUSE HE WILL LOOK LIKE A FOOL AFTER HIS CLUB BREAKS IN FRONT OF MILLIONS OF FANS.
1,does not fit well on walker. tips over. wish I had not ordered it,sorry I purchased this cheaply made walker basket. velcro stips do not hold well and it tips over. RATE ZERO.
1,Very disappointed,"I love make my tea with Cinnamon Sticks, I thought I was getting a big deal with this order, but it turn out be a big disappointment. The cinnamon sticks don't have any smell, I Bring 30 sticks into boil water, and they only have a little bit fragrance.don't buy from them, I throw mine away!!!"
3,So So,"Save your money and rent it.. Was a bit contrived, been there done that.. not so original.. could have been but not so.."
1,Sucks!,"I only gave it 1 star because it wouldn't allow me to give it none. Bad movie, bad script, bad activing. not entertaining!"
5,"Very entertaining,really good movie.",I really like this movie and regardless of the negative comments I will suggest you guys watch this movie and I bet you will notbe disappointed.
5,Why did this move not do better in the box office.?,"This movie was great. Really a hidden gem, some of the best movies in history did not do well at the box office. This is one of them. Gave me a similar feeling to the first time I saw boiler room. Watch this movie and then recommend it to your friends."
5,Best movie ever made,"I envy those of you who will experience the magic and power of Shawshank for the first time.Simply put, this is the greatest movie of all time."
5,Top Three Movie,"This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite movies. ""Get busy living or get busy dying...."" I already own this on DVD, but really like the thought of having it available whenever I want it..."
5,10 Toes Up!,"Probably one of the top 30 greatest films of all time. Stephen King made one little error though. Andy (Tim Robbins), a smart banker, would not have spoken to the warden (who couldn't do anything legally) about his newly discovered witness to prove that he is innocent. Andy would have gone straight to his lawyer who could have re-opened the case."
4,"Good movie, but DVD light on the extras","I bought the DVD and enjoyed the movie. The color and sound were well done. The dvd could have contained more special features, but its still worth your money for under $15."
5,Great movie!,Can't believe I waited so long to see it. Amazing movie. Can't wait to see it again. Love the ending.
5,Really like the movie - Hate the Language...,"I really enjoy the story, but the uncut language is hard for me to sit through. I occasionally see this movie on TV (without the language) and enjoy it very much."
5,Freedom,"What a movie! I love Tim's way of seeming as though he was the teacher's pet most of time, when he never ever was! And what a surprise they all got when he was gone. Just goes to show you that a honest man sentenced for a crime that he didn't commit when put in a certain circumstance can become what he must to survive. And right the wrong and save himself! And that evil is sometimes hiding behind a false face, someone who is pretending to be a good man."
5,Where is the HD DVD !?,Everyone knows that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films of all time.So my question is this: Where is the HD DVD that we were promised in the summer of 2006!?
4,The Fuse Has Yet To Be Lit For This Blockbuster,"Shawshank Redemption is a great movie - probably one of the best of all time. It is, however, neither Tim Robbins nor Morgan Freeman's best work. It is the set-up, the content, the aura, and the mood that makes it so great. DVD has once again presented these aspects in a movie-theater-quality format, both picture quality and sound. The extra features on the DVD are abysmal, though - a major downside. (One theatrical trailer and a few production stills) Buy Shawshank for its content and nothing more. Buy it because you'll love it."
2,Boring,"Definitely the type of oscar-winning movie that will put you to sleep inside an hour. This movie was lame, dry, amd very slow-moving. Why people liked this thing so much? I do not know. I did not feel suspense and/or was I riveted to my seat at all in this movie. Extremely 2-dimensional and the plot of someone trying to get out of jail, I thought was lacking substance. There are way better movies out there."
2,Awful,"Another boring oscar-winning movie. I thought that this was one of the dullest films I have ever seen. The story was so boring and slow-moving. I was wondering when (if ever) something would happen. I found nothing special in this film, just another boring sentimental flick."
5,One of the greatest movies of all time,"I don't watch movies over and over, unless it's the shawshank redemption. Fabulous character development, great story."
5,Only 5 things to say about this movie!,"1)Outstanding!2)Superb!3)Excellent!4)A True Classic!5)Buy it, you'll love it! - One of the finest films ever made.... period!"
5,My all-time favorite,"I love a lot of movies, but this one's still my favorite. The story is fascinating from the first scene to the wonderful ending, which never fails to bring tears to my eyes and a smile to my face. If only Stephen King's books were all this good..."
5,Excellent,"Love this movie - always have. Beautifully written, fabulous story, wonderful actors, great set and filming. Can't say enough about how much this movie touches me. It has become my second favorite movie of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great story with deep characters."
4,"This is a very touching, spiritual movie!","When I first saw this film, I thought "" Whoa"". How could anyone survive such awful treatment, and worse than that, having no one believe you. The actors ( Tim Robins, Morgan Freeman) do a superb job. They bring to life this neo-classic story. I was deeply moved by this motion picture, and the DVD brings the story to your own home. The bonus materials could be better, but the main part of the DVD is the actual movie. Great, great, great film... OK DVD...wonderful cast of actors... Good Buy!"
5,Awesome movie,What a great movie. Didn't realize how much better it would be watching via blu ray on the larger Hd tv :)
4,Modern 'Count of Monte Cristo',I agree with most of the other reviewers. This is a great movie in all respects. But I must point out its similarity to the classic 'Count of Monte Cristo'. An innocent man wrongly convicted and incarcerated in a hellish prison who finds wealth and then has revenge on his accusers. The director presents a subtle hint at this in the scene where the inmates are stocking the library. One of the books being shelved was 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. Nothing more to add except it deserves it's place as one of the all time greats.
1,No redeeming qualities and an unbelievable ending,"I watched this movie after reading several reviews that rated it very highly. Not the usual prison film with violence, riots, etc., they said. Not true! Here is a movie that depicts and accepts severe bullying, both by the prisoners and the guards. The protagonist suffers biweekly beating and sodomy for the first two years; this is trivialized by the narrator as just ""his routine"". Perhaps we are to think that this is a movie about the protagonist rising above such humiliation, but the biweekly ""routine"" is stopped only by the guards bullying the bully, and the protagonist rises only by becoming a crook. The ending is such a surprise that we have to be shown some scenes cut from earlier in the story, while the narrator explains what we missed. But most unbelievable of all is the escape. The protagonist's cell is in the middle of a row, yet he somehow manages to tunnel through the wall not into the next cell but out to freedom! Give me a break!"
5,Love this movie!,Definitely one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. The title doesn't do it justice.
5,Hope is a good thing. Sometimes the best of things.,"The greatest movie ever made. I can watch this over and over again and NEVER get bored. I have watched this at least a dozen times and will keep watching it for the rest of my life.""I hope Andy is down there. I hope to meet my friend and shake his hand. I hope the pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope""Highlight: The ending scene. Its just superb."
5,A Perfect Film,"I love this movie. It's perfect in every way, shape and form. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both give outstanding performances. Frank Darabont writes a wonderful script and directs a terrific film. Quite possibly better than the book, and that is a difficult thing to accomplish. Unlike so many movies today, this is more than one movie. It's many stories, many characters and many films all condensed into the best 140 minutes I have ever experienced. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Now, all we need is a special edition DVD..."
5,One of the best movies ever made!,"How do describe it?Smart story, a lot of suspense, an incredibly good Tim Robbins...I could see this movie over and over again!"
4,"Great Movie, not-so-great DVD","Many great things have been said about this movie, and the movie deserves it. This Stephen King prison tale is excellent (as is his other prison tale The Green Mile). Unfortunately, this DVD is lacking. The only extras on the disk are a trailer and a few photo stills. Originally, the disk was to include a commentary by Morgan Freeman, but he apparently backed out. With all the hype and acclaim around this movie, surely some more extras could have been included. Bottom line - Buy this DVD for the movie, not to learn more about it through extras."
5,"All time Classic Movie, Drastic picture quality improvement","I need not even mention how wonderful this film is, as it's a classic in my book. But I must say, there is a drastically fabulous improvement in the picture quality in the bluray. I was expecting it to look worse considering the age of the film, but I was pleasantly surprised. = ] Certainly recommend for a fantastic HD experience of an older film!"
3,Wrapping,My item came quickly but I paid to have it wrapped and was really disappointed that I will have to redo it. Really poor wrapping.
4,So much easier to get through the airport with this seat,"We got this seat for air travel with our two-year-old. Carrying a car seat, a stroller and carry-on luggage was just too much on our travels to Europe with tight connections. We are happy with the performance of the seat. The only problem we have is that flight attendants constantly question the allowability of the seat. We have been told that the seat does not satisfy regulations on several Lufthansa and Scandinavian flights - despite the ""FAA approved"" sticker on the seat, but were able to use it anyway after some arguing. This and the fact that you have to strap the seat belt over the seat is the only reason I do not give this product five stars."
5,Great for travel!,This seat is really a safety must! After traveling with our infant son we found that riding in cabs or between airports on the shuttle without him in a restraint was just too great of a risk. Now that the seat has the latch system it is easier to use and we have had no problems. It is definitely not for everyday (in your regular car) use but is a must for safe travel. We highly recommend it- easy to understand and use!
3,$19.99 and 4 for 3 promo,"I bought the two I needed because of the sale price. The best thing is the brass hardware which is less popular these days. This is more light brown walnut stained than oak as it appears in the photo but it is better value for me to get brass fittings, wood and an excellent price than to match my cabinetry. I'm very happy. Thank you, Amazon.The plastic nuts for the metal screws are extremely fragile for a heavy seat. If the hardware on your older seat are more durable, use them instead of the plastic nuts.Made in China. ""Sunco""Distributed by Ginsey Industries, Inc. 800-257-7844"
2,Café... aguado,"Una vez más, los ""atrevimientos"" y estereotipos sobre la realidad cubana que eran de esperar. La repetición de la repetidera. Un globo que, como el de Matías Pérez, más tarde o más temprano se desinflará."
5,FAntastic Book!!! Great to give to parents of campers!,"Great, fast service from the vender. Excellent book. FANTASTIC pieces on how to avoid homesickness."
3,Not what I expected,"Not what I expectedThe finish is lousy, has many details of preparation, I think is very costly for the product is. The size, weight and hardness is correct."
3,Poor Quality Control,"I'm not sure how well the tool works... it arrived without a power cord. There are no signs that the package was opened, so I'm assuming that it was incomplete from the factory. Unfortunately, I didn't open it until I needed it, which was outside of the 30 day return period. Okay, ""stuff happens"", and I'm willing to accept that, but when I called Milwaukee, the only assistance they'd give was to direct me to call Amazon. Even if I'd been within the return period, surely Milwaukee could've resolved the issue immediately rather than expect a customer to wait a couple of weeks while they shipped the tool back for resplacement. I bought the Milwaukee name partly because I thought they'd stand behind their tools -- I'm sincerely disappointed."
3,I was disappointed.,"i found this book choppy at best. it is true some of the writing was lyrical, but there was not enough accessible story to sustain my interest. i found it greatly lacking in character development -- who WERE all these people? i didn't buy the instant relief brought by michaela to jakob; it seemed like no more than a writer's invention. the second portion, which concentrated on ben was even harder to like; i had no sympathy for his affair with petra and his denial of his wife; even worse, i didn't believe any of it because i saw them all as cardboard people. i kept wanting to scream, ""get over it! get therapy!"" -- not a usual or expected reaction to a holocaust story. this book just seemed to go nowhere; way too much philosophical rumination. i did appreciate reading about greece during the war, and some of the holocaust images were haunting, but for an infinitely more moving book about the nature of time, space, and memory, read Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman."
5,One of the most eloquent beautifully written books I've read,"One might think from the bookjacket that Fugitive Pieces would be depressing. Rather, it manages to show a survivor's appreciation of life, saved from the cliches of being ""uplifting"" and ""inspiring"" by the acknowledgement of the memories that haunt Jakob. Admittedly, the portion of the book that deals with the earlier portions of Jakob's life is more engaging. The language and style of the book, however, are such that the story itself is secondary. There are passages of such surpassing beauty and perfection that I wanted to call people from London just to say, ""listen to this, isn't this gorgeous?"" Definitely one of the most stunning pieces of writing I've encountered lately."
2,Overcoming Boredom for Tragedy,"I was assigned to read this book for an English class at my school and I probably wouldn't have read it on my own, and if i didn't read it I don't think I would have missed much. This book contained many good life themes about love and tragedy, but throughout the book they were lost in the endless sea of words that caused the reader to fall asleep. Only in certain portions of the book did I feel that I was half interested in what was going on. The only bright spot of this book to me was the heroic story of a scared young Jewish boy who grows up to realize his dreams and conquer his own fears. I would only recommend this book to very diligent readers who do not get bored with meaningless details. If you are not one of those readers do not read this book, for the meaning will become lost when you fall asleep. There are many other books out there that deal with the same issues, the difference is they convey it in a much better way."
1,It's good to know that other people disliked this book...!,"At first I thought that the reason why I was finding this book astonishingly boring was that I am not mother tongue.. But then, When I read the opinion of the reader from London! Well, Now I feel better. This is indeed a boring, obscure, vague, and at times even pretentious novel. The plot is ludicrous. The message unclear. The only context where the book is worth reading is before going to bed. I will miss it, for this purpose only... If anyone does not share my opinion, please do write me and explain me while I missed the point..."
1,What fresh hell is this?!,"This book is too bad to review but too lauded to ignore.Another reviewer calls it holocaust-lite; it is also poetry-lite. What it is heavy on is mawkishness, pretension and self-pity; I would guess that the author was as surprised by its reception as anyone. Did it infiltrate itself as a bookgroup virus, perhaps - a sort of literary AIDS?You don't neutralize pain by turning it into schmalz (too reminiscent of what the Nazis did, already...) Or if it's just a fancy Cabaret-style backdrop to the author's Hallmark card self-indulgence, well - that would, in Oscar Wilde's words, 'lend a new horror to death'.This book - surely now notorious? - and its reception would make an excellent subject for a book, however."
2,Pale compared to The White Hotel,"Like others who've offered their reviews, this book was recommended highly to me by a friend. Perhaps if I had not already read The White Hotel, another novel by a poet with the holocaust as a theme, my opinion of this book would have been higher, but where the White Hotel successfully bridges the poetic and the narative, Fugitive Pieces fails.I was unconvinced by the endless parade of quasi-poetic aphorisms: ""Every moment is two moments."" ""Complicity is not sudden, though it occurs in an instant."" ""There's no absence if there remains even the memory of absence.""The author does not let the reader judge the meaning of the scattered recollections that make up this book, but insists on stating the meaning explicitly. I found this alienating, and I never felt at all immersed in this book.I do strongly recommend D.M. Thomas's The White Hotel, however."
4,Suspense? Terror? Science Fiction? All in one,"This is the perfect book to be retaken by a Hollywood script writer and give it a more modern approach. At least one in which the ""hero"" is not such an imbecile. Additionally, the reason why the crucial release of information is being delayed by the ""good guys"" does not make sense and such secret sustains the plot, so the reader always feels that some tension is missing and that on a suspense novel is a terrible flaw. Nevertheless is fun to read and is quite likely to keep you engaged."
4,A Classic that holds up well,"For a book over 70 years old, I was very impressed with the story. There was action and adventure from start to finish which was not hampered by how old the book was. However, this was originally a pulp novel, and it shows. Don't expect be made to ponder the complexities of life or the nature of good vs. evil. This book was written for enjoyment only and science fiction fans should be able to appreciate it for what it is."
4,What a grand tale,"It's sad that this has been unavailablefor a while. This fantasy tale from oneof the SF giants is very plainly from itstime period, but nevertheless has agedwell, and continues to entertain. Williamsonmanages to maintain a balance in the strugglebetween good and evil that doesn't grateyet keeps one on edge."
5,Fantastic Collection,Ornette Coleman is a Genius of the first Order.His Music Here is timeless&Stunning.The Music is Amazing.The Vibe is Unbelievable.
5,"A superb intro to Nietzsche's main ideas, without the burden if his ponderous writings.","I agree with the two earlier reviewers: this is an EXCELLENT short work (88 pages) that covers Nietzsche's main ideas: the Mind, religion, knowledge, the Will to Power, the Herd and the Individual, and Eternal Recurrence. With Nietzsche, it's easy to get bogged down in his ponderous ""stream of consciousness"" writing style (just try reading ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" and understand what he's going on about!). However, the author, Eric Steinhart, does a superb job of conveying the gist of Nietzsche's ideas, both as they stand and in the context of the history of philosophy that they address. John V. Karavitis. Five stars! John Karavitis"
5,Highly valuable at multiple levels,"This book can be read at many different levels and, as the introduction suggests, you can stop reading after any chapter, depending on your immediate needs and readiness to learn more. I can attest that it works both for novice learners and for novice teachers. The author clearly speaks from authority and experience. When he says that this condition is more important to verify and that one is less so, depending on your situation and goals, he is conveying information is quite valuable and hard to find elsewhere."
3,Will NOT read Apple 800k floppies,"I was unaware when purchasing this item, specifically for copying some old font data purchased many years ago on 800k Apple floppies to my iMac that this item DOES NOT READ THEM. If you are in the market for a multi-card reader that DOES NOT INCLUDE xD cards but reads the later 1.4mb PC and Mac floppies you are ok.So beware of any ambiguous item descriptions.Brian W.Tucson."
3,car charger,Works like a charm. I had trouble finding a cord to connect the power source to the transmitter. Finally got Radio Shack to construct one for 15.00.
1,Locks up 3G ipod,"as mentioned in previous reviews, this item does not really work well with my 3rd generation iPod. It freezes the unit which then must be reset."
3,Locks up generation 3 ipod,"From the first time I used this I am having problems with the ipod locking up. Everytime the hard disk starts spinning to read a song it locks up. This charger is fine for when the ipod is off, but its a hassle when it has to charge and play songs at the same time."
3,It was good,"I thought it was a good read and certainly a classic. but personally i liked the movie better. i didnt find myself caring about the characters as much as i did for the film but it was still very well written, illustrated, and delivered"
1,V for Vendetta,I do not like the comic book format. I am an adult and prefer text to pictures except where a picture is needed.
3,"Great story, but not the quality product I expected","This is another brilliant Alan Moore story and I'm glad I read it before seeing the upcoming film. My only issue with the product is the newsprint-like paper it's printed on. For the price, I thought I was getting a better quality paper that won't yellow inside of a couple of years."
4,I guess I need to put a title here,"A great story, different from the movie for sure. I LOVE the movie, and the themes in it are great. The comic doesn't carry the same themes, but ends with the same weight as the movie and with a vast story that makes you think."
5,The first comic that ever hit me as classic literature,"I had read a number of comics before I could get hold of a copy of V4vendetta. I read it all in one go, cried through it, was astonished by the twists of the tale and it really got me thinking for a long time. To me, it is as good as ""1984"" by George Orwell. A lot of die hard critics and writers who look down on comics and say they are kids' stuff ought to read this and see if they can write remotely as well."
4,"Remember, Remember...","I consider the Wachowsik Brothers movie adaptation to be one of my favorite films, so I figured it was only fair to buy the graphic novel. This was one of Alan Moore's earlier works, and the inexperience shows a little, but it's still a great story. I didn't realize how much the Wachowski Brothers had changed the story for the movie. I think they made improvements, as the story feels a bit weak. The book is also fairly short, containing a lot of dark artwork. The art is good, for the most part, but some images are confusing. Despite these gripes, it's still an amazing story. Fans of the movie will be surprised, but I still recommend it."
4,"Good, mid-period John Wayne western","John Wayne's tough-guy character gets some choice zingers in this amiable, two-fisted, entertaining (and occasionally ricketty) western about a Texas Ranger who's out to bust up a gun-running gang that's selling arms to the Comanche renegades. It's one of those films where the Indians drop like flies every time the cowboys open fire, but it zips along at a pleasant pace, with a tad more plot than normal. Lee Marvin has a short but choice role as Mr. Crow, a sinister gunslinger who goes on a roaring bender with Wayne, paving the way for their interplay in the '62 sizzler, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence."" This was the last film directed by Michael Curtiz, who is probably best known for his work on ""Casablanca,"" and while this film is nowhere near the same league at that classic, it still has its moments."
5,Fast shipping and good quality,The product was sent as agreed and received in the promised condition. I am a happy costumer :)- Joakim
3,Little things mean a lot.,"This is a book with a thousand details from every source, and the writer is very good--clever, well-spoken, and educated. But sometimes he goes too far, and I found he bent over too far backward in his writings of the two disobedient Custer-haters, Reno and Benteen. They survived because they disobeyed direct orders from their commander, whom they envied and even hated, writing anonymous notes to his wife accusing him of adultery, and then writing anonymous notes to him, accusing her of adultery with Captain Weir. There are many small details in which the author fails to note the true comments about Custer's abilities while trying to seem somewhat unprejudicied, when it is very obvious he dislikes Custer and all he stands for--bravery, patriotism, honor, obedience to orders, and a hundred other words which survive his silliness, his over-eagerness, and other flaws. Altogether while it is a good book, I have read some dozen books, and find he is very biassed against Custer."
2,"SAME OLD, SAME OLD (AGAIN)","Once again, Universal has released another Buddy Holly CD, and once again, they've dropped the ball. There is nothing here that wasn't released on last year's GOLD. And that was a rehash of THE BUDDY HOLLY COLLECTION. This time we get even less, since almost half the tracks are missing.In 2009, Buddy Holly's recordings will enter the public domain. Maybe then Bear Family or someone who cares will release the box set containing Holly's complete works."
5,Brilliant Post-Modernist Manifesto,"Paul Petroskey, the master of post-modern landscapes, has struck pure gold once again with his simply amazing new album. The title, a study of the horrors inherrent in the polarity of our failed and flawed technologies and the chaos which these weaknesses wreck in our lives, is just one of the thousands brilliant metaphors liberally laced throughout this work.Channelling the energies of Marshall McLuhan's ""The Medium is the Massage"" into audio format, then twisting them subtly with Nietzche's concept of the ""Ubermensch"", Petroskey strikes a sharp chord, one so fierce in it's intensity, that the government has banned this album from radio play in hopes to stave off the inevitable revolution that would undoubtably unfold if only more knew of the power of this disk.Dreaded Glaucoma Test, indeed. Bravo, Weird Paul."
5,Great workout,Cycle Reebok: Foundations and Interval Training with Robert ShermanGreat 2 options available. Very challenging. Lots of endurance training.
2,to bored,"The routines are good, but for me is very bored, flat in music, looks like be in a classroom with a bored teacher even the content is interesting."
3,poor music,"The photography in this DVD is very good. What spoils it is the music. For some reason I find it very harsh sounding in the first half of the DVD. The second half it sounds much more relaxing. I wouldn't expect a person to be able to relax to the first half of this DVD. Many new scenes suddenly pop up as well as bold, loud blasts of music. I play it with the sound off."
5,Great Overview Book,"This is a very well written, easy to read book. There are great illustrations and maps as well. If you don't know anything about the Franco-Prussian war this is THE BOOK you need to get."
1,The worst I have ever listened to.,"This CD was just awful. There was nothing funny on it at all. Sounded like a grown drunk man making prank calls that were not at all funny. I wouldn't have given it the one star if I could have left a rating without any stars.Don't waste your $15.00 on this. This wasn't worth a nickel. The only thing listening to this CD did for me was to make me mad that Amazon, or anyone would be selling this stuff under the title ""Great""."
1,to whomever included this in the gift guide for grads...,"um, it's well into 2007... late enough that college graduations have begun... perhaps you should update this listing..."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Ugh! I'm on page 140 of this book, and came to Amazon to remember why I thought I wanted to read it in the first place. I have to agreee with the other folks who gave this book 1 & 2 stars, this book just doesn't live up to its potential (or its reviews/awards). It's just plain boring and, as much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, it's not worth wasting any more of my time. Besides, I really don't care how it ends. Who are all of the people that gave this book great reviews?.....wait a minute, maybe they are the same folks who think Harlequins are literature."
1,corrupted cd,Corrupted cd. Will not play on computer without installing some form of malicious software.
4,great collection of old stuff from genius songwriter,"A collection of tunes from genius singer/songwriter/guitarist Paul K's many self-released cassettes, The Blue Sun's sound quality is all over the place but the quality of the songs themselves never falters. From raging rockers like ""Amphetamines and Coffee"" to acoustic troubadourisms like ""Root Canal Blues,"" Paul and his crew deliver. My faves are the two righteous instrumentals ""Satellite"" and ""Interstate"" and the epic ten-minute title track, which was the easy highlight of his SXSW '98 performance - just beautiful. The really scary thing is that after this album, which chronicles his musicmaking up through 1992, he got even better."
5,Terrific read,"A look at the bizarre history of Poland, as you read this it is so crazy that you cant make stuff like this up.James Michener has produced a fascinating series of historical snapshots on Polish History since the twelth century. The last three chapters dealing with that portion of Poland under Austrian-Hungarian rule, the end of World War l and Poland under the Nazis are especially well written. I am sure that there are some historical inaccuracies, but the idea of tracing Polish history through the vicissitudes of two important families is very clever."
1,So MUCH Fluff!!,"I enjoyed James Michener's novel Hawaii. I liked the way it was laid out and the fact that it showed how the flows of immigration from different groups of people led to the unique lifestyle and openness of Hawaii. He managed to do this by focusing on people - after all this IS an historical novel. In Poland, however, Michener goes on and on about what was on the menu for this feast or that feast. He talks on and on about who wears what and who is groomed in this way or that way. (Let's leave the worthless focus on such things to People!) He talks about the viciousness of the Swedes in the 15th century or the Turks in the 17th century, but he ignores the viciousness of the Russians in the 20th century. I guess he approved of their menus and their appearance."
1,Hated it,"Michener uses outdated historiography in a overtly nationalistic interpretation of Polish history. In both his chapters on Sweden and the Ottomans there are gross inaccuracies which serve to perpetuate historical misinterpretations. Must be regarded as fiction and not seen as a true ""history of Poland.:"""
4,Very helpful with insight on the histories of the Kingdoms,"David and Leigh did an excellent job in relaying details of the histories of the Kingdoms of the West and the Angaraks. Also present are the Mallorean Gospels, the Holy Books, the Battle of Vo Mimbre, details on each culture of people, and an excerpt from King Anheg's diary."
2,A Disappointing end to a Great Series,"The Belgariad was my first introduction to epic fantasy,it enthralled me like no story had before.I have re-read it and the Mallorean a number of times and despite the rather annoyingly cute(and repetetive) banter between the characters always found myself saddened at the thought that there would be no more tales from this wonderful world. This point was made loud and clear in the Rivan Codex but beyond that there was nothing really new . If you have read the series as much as I have you will find that this pretty much old hat. The insights into the creative process were interesting in themselves but not enough to justify an entire new book. In conclusion if you are a huge Eddings fan you will find this book worth reading. I'm just not sure that it is worth buying."
2,A disappointing effort from David and Leigh Eddings.,"The Rivan Codex is a disappointing effort from the Eddings. Rather than advance the story of Pol, Garion, Old Wolf and company, this book seems to have been published just for the sake of publishing. It contains material that the authors wrote as references when they began writing their trilogies. Some of the 'holy books' are truely mind numbing while others are just gibberish.In the foreword David Edding states that they published because of pressure from fans of his trilogies. After reading the Rivan Codex I think fans would have been better served re-reading the original books."
3,An Opportunity For A Telemann Rarity,"The impression left by this performance is one of being at times a little lacklustre. The soloists and choir are capable but not top drawer, while the period orchestra is pretty good though slightly lacking in clarity thanks to the reverberant accoustic.Telemann still manages to shine through which makes one wish the piece had received a more compelling rendering. That said, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to know this rarity. Considering he created over 40 passion settings it is remarkable that there is no sense of the routine in this music."
4,Wonderful and unique,"I ordered this based off the description and atomizer. It is truly a great, unique, rich secent of amber. The scent blends well and is velvety. The only complaint I have is packaging - only the large bottle comes with the atomizer but that is ok, since after a couple weeks the seals on it start to leak! Even sitting undisturbed, it vaporized and oozed out all over the top of the bottle. Don't bother with the atomizer - just enjoy the great scent."
2,Not in love with Prada,I don't like the scent. It is very strong. I have tried to wear it twice and even tried to mix with a softer scent. I wasted money. Contact me for purchase.
2,Sexy scent - worthless packaging,"I love this scent and recieved it as a Mother's Day gift in May. I wear it maybe once a week because it is a bit heavy for Houston summers. I checked the bottle last week and it was almost gone! As another reviewer mentioned, the atomizer had leaked and my beautiful perfume had evaporated!I returned it to the store and they gave me a brand new, full bottle with a new atomizer. Now I'm worried to even use it. Their impractical advice. ""Use the atomizer only when you want to wear the perfume. Otherwise, leave the other top on the bottle."" Where am I supposed to store the atomizer in the meantime? GRRRRR because I love the scent. I may just return this bottle for the spray."
5,addictive!,"I normally do not like anything with a ""sandalwood"" scent..but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull! They are not lying when they refer to it as an ""addictive"" scent in the description..I got a small sample bottle and fell in love...it is perfect for the winter/fall seasons, not so much for the summer. It's fun when people ask what I'm wearing and I get to casually say ""Prada."" Considering I live in Tennessee most people have no idea what that means..but I still feel special!"
5,exquisite,"I love this perfume. The fragrance is deep and sensual, but not overpowering. For anyone who perfers more woodsy and musky scents, this is perfect."
4,Great.,I like this product because there are times when I need a mgnifier but did not have an extra hand to hold it.
4,Mindy Mylrea,Great dvd for beginner and moderate spin cyclists. She instructs those who are new to spinning with detailed information that is important for any cyclist. Good workout throughout the dvd. It's challenging and fun.
4,great for beginners - okay for more experienced spinners,"I think this would be a great dvd for beginners - as it goes into detail about bike set-up ( none of the other 6-7 dvd's I have mention this). This is invaluable info for someone who has never done spinning. He also describes good technique etc. But as a more experienced rider, it was a little redundant info for me. Also his delivery is a little hokey, and very canned. Im sure he is reading off a tele-prompter the whole time. It is good that he gives workout options to choose from to vary your workout from day to day. Overall, a keeper."
1,Cycle Challenge DVD,I was really disappointed with this DVD. I felt it didn't offer much of a workout and I'm a beginner. I used only once and now it is just collecting dust. I bought Spin and Slim instead and love that one so much more.
2,"Good technique, not motivating","Ms. Mylrea's DVD appears solid from a technical standpoint. She seems well trained and certified and takes a gradual approach that includes setting up your bike and cycling through various stages accordingly to your fitness level.However, this DVD did not motivate or inspire me to cycle. Part of the problem are her put-downs to her male riding partner. His bike is off to the side of the screen and for some reason, he isn't allowed to speak. We know that she's front and center and these one-liners are unnecessary.I returned this piece to amazon a week after receipt."
5,MMMMM...now thais some good Black Metal,"Yes even a Christian like myself loves this ""evil"" and ""satanic"" black metal stuff. I really like Naglfar's meliodic black metal sound. This is possibly one the best black metal bands i've ever heard in my entire life! No kidding either. From ""I Am Vengeance"" to ""The Infernal Ceremony"" I was listening with my jaw on the floor. I was shocked. I was really digging this album. If you like black metal in the vien of Mayhem, then this band is for you."
3,Not wrong...just different,"Okay, I'm the one who wrote the last review and when I wrote it I thought that the stitches were wrong but it turns out that they are called different things in the UK. Who knew? Not me obviously. So I'm sorry for the confusion. The book uses UK terms rather than US ones. If you are used to the US terms it will make following the patterns more difficult as you will have to translate from the UK terms but otherwise it's an okay book."
3,An important Introduction to the Ethiopic Writing System,"This english-language work asks more questions than it answers but a selective reading hints at the powerful and often surprising qualities of the Ge'ez language. It is left up to the reader to to pursue and solve the Ge'ez riddle. Good Luck, cheerful Egyptians, Meroists, Rastafarians and all our good wise men!"
3,Okay,If this was an industry standard in the US it might make more sense to purchase.In the corporate world or in the printing world Adobe products rule. This is a god product but you might have to convert more than you want.
2,crash city,"I upgraded from v10 hoping to see a lot of new features. CorelDraw in itself is a very valuable program - I have used it for years.However v12 does crash and it does crash often, and for this reason alone it is extremely dissapointing. I don't think it was worth the upgrade, there just aren't enough new useful features to offset the frequent crashing / memory leak problems.Basically what you get is some spiffy modernized graphics and icons, no significant improvement to the UI. The word on the street has it that there are some new features however I haven't explored enough to find them. I suppose the masking is a bit better. They still haven't added a curve smoothing option to the path tool in photopaint, this was a feature I was hoping I would see in v12."
1,For general information only.,"The Backyard Vinter presented only general information about wine making, not specific enought for an individual wanting to learn how to make wine."
5,"Great Features, Fantastic Value","I ordered this Motorola phone set to replace a failing V-tech unit after reading favorable reviews here on Amazon. Once I got the set and put it to use I found it convenient, feature-rich (the intercom feature is great) with excellent sound quality. I ordered from Tigerdirect and received the phones within 3 days of order thanks to the best shipping company in the business (Go Big Brown!). You can't miss with this phone."
5,Excellent set,"This set is excellent! It has the indicator light for those of us who have the answering service from the phone company, it also has an intercome so you can contact someone in another room with out yelling out to them. They're small and sleek and only needs one phone jack to work, the other bases uses outlets. Very convenient."
4,Easy read with interesting history from a bygone era,"Nicely done memoir of a young man and his family in the early 20th century,although in reality, they endured conditions more likely encountered during the early 1800's."
4,great tale of the prairie,"for my friend who grew up in that territory, it was her Christmas present. Now she is moving to the desert in Kingman, appropriate gift in that sense"
4,Last for about a year with everyday use,"I buy these cheap in price boots because they last just as long as the higher priced boots. Ok, well almost but for the price you can't beat them."
4,Had to exchange,We bought these boots as a gift for my step-daughter for Christmas. The sizing chart for this item was incorrect. They did run a bit too large so we had to exchange for a smaller size. But when the re-order arrived 2 days later the smaller size fit nicely.
2,poorly made,"after only a couple months the sole of the boots split open on both of them in the middle. it started with a crack, than split. i dont know what these soles are made with but they don't last worth anything..."
2,Works fine for 2 years,"This works for about the duration of the manufacturer's warranty. Today, mine just conked out without warning. If you decide to get one of these, just make sure you back up your files after every use."
5,Unlawful Entry,"Another tight album from Brown Man that includes Frost, Litefoot, a new song by Mr. Kee ""Bloody Murder"" that sets Kee as the ruler of all Latin rap in the Bay. Los Marijuanos have a little something on Gang Banga and a new Colombian rapper from Europe drops a tight song called ""We B Up In This"" produced by Norway's finest Big Ice. ""Hemped Up"" features Chuck Nutt another balla from tha 707 and B-Legit discussing what the green could be if it was legal. And finally Wicked Minds from Los Angeles got the Scarface involved. Its all about the Brown and Black babee just wait til 2010...."
3,"""The Annals of Imperial Rome""",This is a book that has a lot of information in it to allow the reader get an understanding of Rome in the early centries.
4,Good but not great CD,"Like what the above reviewer said: Not a trance CD. Much more house. Kernkraft 400 is one of the best trance songs ever. Even people who aren't into dance music find that song catchy. Honestly, I outplayed this CD, and am now kinda sick of it. One huge problem is that the songs are not mixed together which I prefer always because it helps the CD to flow much better. The songs don't blend that well. The Launch is another good song on the CD. All in all a pretty good CD with 1 incredible song, 3 very good songs, a few below average songs. By the way I find myself always prefering the Ministry of Sound series."
1,"Bought it in August 2001, loved it.... Then stuff happens.","I bought the Predator August of last year (2001). I loved the product. I had nothing but praises.. until now (May 2002). The device stopped working on me instantly out of nowhere. It wouldn't read the recommended CD brands. It wouldn't work on my friend's laptop. And it would spin at a low speed at its own desire. Iomega tech support people were very nice, yet very clueless also. I don't know what to do with this extra piece of plastic laying around the house now. ... It's really a no-wonder why the price of this device shot down dramatically. I'd think twice about buying the product if I were you. (Hint: ... buy an MP3 player instead)"
1,"Looks, but nothing else","I just recently bought and returned my iomega predator cd rw. I was excitedly attempting to use it with my G4 mac, but soon discovered that it would become the root of all evil in my computer. True, installation and hook up were incredibly easy, but the lack of mac software was disappointing. I encountered numerous problems, only managing to burn 4 disks in total, wasting over a dozen disks in the process because the iomega support was extremely poor. I used primiarly the online chat support and found their employees to be very unknowledgable and unsympathetic. Suggestions to burn disks at 1x and 2x had to be a joke -- why spend this kind of money on something that takes forever to burn?!This was a shock for me to discover since up until now I have thought highly of Iomega products.I would not recommend this product for actual use -- if you want something to sit on your computer desk and look pretty, this is it. Spend your money elsewhere."
5,love the purchasing option,"I discovered the first book as a Kindle Daily Deal and quickly became enthralled. I knew there was supposed to be a series coming, checked and found it here. I watched all 4 of the first ones over the weekend and found them enjoyable. (I appreciated the opportunity to sign up for all as they become available, paying along the way. This way I don't have to keep checking to see if there are new ones to watch.) I'll continue to work my way through the books, though, and treasure every minute reading his exceptional writing. If you have to choose, pick the books. They last longer and are exceptional compared to enjoyable."
4,The Next Great Western,"Cowboys and Indians, 21st Century Wyoming style. The characters are complicated and interesting, the scenery is incredible and the plots have unexpected twists. Can't wait for Season 2!"
5,A Meaty Episode,"In this episode, Longmire needs to ferret out why a man was attacked and how to protect the public from a bearthat might be out of control.He discerns the man's past isn't too savory, as there were more people who wanted to maul him than just the bear.Longmire has another problem, too. The former sheriff has to be jailed and is causing all kinds of ruckus in his office, trying to solve his crimes for him and telling him how to do his job. The curmudgeonly codger adds quite a bit of humor and mayhem to the show.Speaking of humor, you may not want to barbeque for awhile after watching this episode.This is a meaty episode, one which Longmire fans are sure to enjoy. If you can bear a little gruesomeness, this is an engaging episode. The scenery is especially majestic."
3,"Okay, but......the books are better (shocker!)","This guy isn't Walt Longmire....where is the humour? The Bear? Sorry, but he's not even close. That character commands attention, respect....is practically mythical in these great books by Johnson. The stories are too simplistic, not at all about the crazy lengths Sheriff Longmire goes to to ""get his man"". EH is all I can say."
4,Anyone can play Tottenham Trivia,"I bought the game as a birthday gift for a Tottenham Hotspur super fan only to find that he expected me to play it with him! Well, surprise! You don't need to know anything to play this game and still have fun! I only answered three questions correctly (all on basic rules of soccer) and was still in the game. It's probably more of a collectors item than useful game but it was still fun to play."
4,Outlook for Dummies,"Sent quickly and in the exact condition that was stated. Great service, good book!"
2,Just Fair,"This is a fair overview of Outlook if you're not familiar with the program. Unfortunately, I was also looking for something on .pst files and backups, which is totally missing from this volume. Even the index has nothing about .pst files, and the ""backup"" entry has a smart aleck paragraph about how poor a job Outlook does of providing backup. Not at all helpful."
5,Great step workout,I love this step workout. Lots of fun. You can do it with the weights or without.
3,Great for a beginner,"I was feeling sorta nostalgic when I ordered this because my very first home exercise video, close to 20 years ago, was by Keli Roberts. I've graduated to more vigorous routines since then and found this one much too easy for my current fitness level. Even so, this would be a great workout for the beginning exerciser. The choreography is basic and easy to follow, though it should be noted that those with knee problems might have difficulty with the number of jumps and turns over and around the step."
2,Dancer I am not..,"I was hopeful that based on other reviews I could enjoy this workout, however not so much. There is no queing of the next steps and it moves very fast even for myself who has been stepping for a while. I was disappointed."
5,"FAST, HEAVY & BRUTAL....THE WAY IT SHOULD BE..","I HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY WITH THESE GUY`S THIS YEAR.. THEY`RE AWESOME, {SEE THEM LIVE IF YOU CAN} BRUTAL DEATH METAL.AT ITS FINEST.. THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE ,A MUST TO BE IN ONES DEATH METAL COLLECTION.. HOW CAN SOMETHING THIS hEAVY COME OUT OF kansas??? unbelieveable musicianship...."
3,Practices from the yoga journal website,"This DVD contain 5 decent practices to help you advance your poses, these are all practices that are (or were) on their website. These are not full practices and you are advised to do sun salutations and standing poses before by your own and in some practices to finish with finishing poses and relaxation by your own. I would appreciate more accurate and detailed info about this product like what advanced poses are on this DVD, if you think there is a practice of dropping back to wheel pose from standing like in the cover then you are wrong (again). Rodney Yee & Jason Crandell are among the teachers who designed the practices. The advanced poses are : Visvamitasana , Wheel pose, headstand with twist, king pigeon variation (with full splits) and archer pose. To get to some of these poses you should practice for a long time (and preferably with a teacher) though the tips on this DVD are helpful."
3,"expect advanced moves, not and advanced DVD","I was disappointed in this video, as there are only 5 ""Advanced Postures"", and some of the suggested moves to get into them are not as safe and effective as I beleive they could potentially be. Only two of the 5 poses eluded to on this video were poses I was previously interested in evolving in my own Yoga practice. I guess I was hoping for more, or expecting something different. As a bonus, this video will not be dated any time soon. The set, filming techniques, and clothing are classic."
5,Big Value in a Small Package!,"I have used my Photosmart 375 for over a year with great results. It is very easy to use and the pictures are consistantly excellent. I am really impressed with my new Photosmart 475, it produces the same beautiful output, only in 5x7 as well as 4x6. Just like the 375 it allows you to view, crop and frame your pictures right on the printer, before you print them. One of the many new features on the 475 also allows you to save images in the printers hard drive, so with the battery option so you can take it just about anywhere and store your images on the go!Great Job HP!"
5,Didymus will show you.,"When I picked this book up, I wasn't aware of how good it would be. It totally blew me away. This is a book that could easily be read in one sitting but I chose to take my time to really imagine the creative setting and futuristic choices that the author made. The begining was great, just the right sort of emotional rollercoaster you would need in order to stay focused on the principle of this book. The two fellow scientist's traveling back in time to find jesus is a very original plot and, to tell you the truth, just the kind of thing I've been waiting to read for a long time. Any fan of christian literature or just science fiction in general would love this book. This book is worthy of an H.G. Wells award and should be made into a movie one day.This is definetely a book that I will re-read like crazy becuase it's just that enjoying from begining, middle, to end. This guy is now one of my favorite authors."
4,An interesting mix of the bible and time travel,"This is my first ever review so bear with me. I have finished this book in one day it was so gripping. It has an interesting mix of biblical references and last years of Jesus with time travel of scientists from our time. I have never read the bible so it was hard to follow some of the events and quotes. I liked the concept of time travel and our ability to influence the future by what we do in the past, it is not novel in sci fi, but interesting. Overall the book is an easy read and it will make you think and wonder the what if question, however I think the author could have expanded some of the parts of the book and made it longer. Hope this review was helpful."
5,Rarities is a beautiful CD worth buying,"Ron Sexsmith's latest CD is amazing. It consists of songs which did not make it to his 6 other CDs, and a few old favourites rerecorded. The 16 songs on this work of beauty demonstrate once again that Ron is an amazing lyrical poet and makes beautiful melodies. I've heard a few of these songs at Ron's concerts, and was wondering when they would appear on a CD...here they are.""We don't know why we're here...though the stars look down as if to saywe're too latein this world where time is everythingwe're too late, my darling""Ron is an original songsmith!"
4,Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Big fan of the show and look forward to receiving my set of season 1. Every season was awesome. Can't recall what season,but always loved the epidode with Tom Hanks. He played Uncle Ned,his alcoholic uncle.Hanks in one of his many great moments."
5,a GREAT freddie gem,"I think that this is a great freddie album and is definately a must have in any jazz fan's collection. Listen especially to hubbard's fine work on Lament For Booker (written for another great trumpeter,Booker Little) and For Spee's Sake and you will find that this is one of the best Blue Note albums of all time!!!"
3,Eh...,"This was an ""okay"" Trek novel in the franchise. The story was a little beyond what you would see in a normal episode. The story dealt with a double-double agent that worked for neither the Romulans or the Federation, but in fact was trusted by both. The way the story tied together at the end was a little sketchy, as it seemed the author tried to tie up all the loose ends at the last moment.I knew who the ""villain"" was before I even got half way through, and while the ending was not what I expected, it gave me the same resolution I was hoping NOT to see."
3,This is just Dreams of the Raven with Spock,"This book is good, because, Spock is going insane and can barely remember anything after fall off a cliff. He takes a new experimental drug, given by a so called 'doctor' working for the Romulans. So he loses it and gets sent home to Vulcan. He later recovers and helps to destroy the Romulan base. This book is good if you like the predictable, or just Spock."
4,Why Vash IS the Stampede,"WOW! I really have enjoyed Trigun as a fun, and silly anime. This disc really gives me a whole new respect for Vash. He's been goofy, girl-crazy, and has a soft spot for kids. Here, he gets angry. REALLY ANGRY. This is not a man to be trifled with, and one of the final scenes, where you see what he looks like out of his red longcoat, is sobering. Vash has his horrific secrets, and here you get a glimmer of what is under his happy facade. I gave it four stars because one episode is almost entirely a rehash of the previous shows. Trigun is worth the watch."
4,Very fun game,"For those that have grown up with Harry Potter, this game is certainly good addition to the franchise. I love the concept of the spell challenges, which have continued since the Sorcerer's Stone. This game's graphics are clean but not overdone, which is a nice change. On a negative side, I wish the game was longer, and that there were some stealth/keep-away-from-Filch sections like in previous games.Excellent game."
5,Really great product!,"True to color, pattern and size. Fabric is soft and easily comes clean in the washer. It's amazing how liquids just bead up and wipe off. Get it, you won't regret it!!!"
1,Error on the cover,"The hand is improperly set in the picture on the cover.Should be a pair of aces up front, with 2 pair back (queens and aces). The hand set in that manner is unbeatable, but not guaranteed a winner."
2,Not up to Dale's previous work,"I just have to stop buying Mr. Brown's books. It's not that the book was bad, it wasn't. Unfortunately, the writing, plot and characters simply aren't up Mr. Brown's earlier efforts.When I read Tin Man (a terrible book) I vowed to buy no more of Mr. Brown's books but I borrowed Warrior Class from the library. Mr. Brown's earlier books were superb but, like so many other decent authors, he seems to have grown stale. The characters and their relationships seem shallower and much more neurotic. The plot -- a russian criminal bringing the Europe to the verge of war through the use of one stealth bomber for the sole purpose of getting an oil line built --- is far too thin.I was disappointed."
2,Crosses the line,"I usually enjoy stories of this type. However, Mr. Brown's latest effort is disturbing in its underlying message - that it is okay, no, it is patriotic, for private citizens to become vigilanties if they believe the cause is right. In the novel, ex-President Martindale,ex-Air Force officers McLanahan and Briggs, and powerful private citizens Masters and Tork establish their own ""private"" military to fight wars when the elected government of the United States chooses take a more isolationist stance. Mr. Brown's story-telling abilities are, as usual, quite riveting. But I can't agree with the message."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Stealth planes and Evil Oil Baron.Your average megavillain rich megalomaniac wants to control an oil pipeline. This, being a military technothriller, means that the US types of course have to now go and blow the you know what out of him. This is trickier than usual because he has a bomber that is very difficult to detect.Of course, McLanahan and his crew of Dreamworks gadgeteers and support pilots have some tech tricks of their own, so shooting and blowing up does get to happen."
1,Very Poor Stand,I got the same experience as another user. This stand is not strong enough. It seems that the monitor stand cannot support the weight of the screen and slumps/tilts forward over time (a few months). Now I can't even tilt it up to facing straight forward.
2,Great Until it Crapped Out,"One year and two months after purchasing this monitor, the screen failed. Samsumg is sending a ""refurbished"" replacement - I am terrified about what that might mean. What a shame - I like the monitor. Good thing I had an old CRT kicking around as back up - seems you can't kill those, but the flat screens are a different story."
1,Supernatural rip off,"""The Screaming Skull"" is a good ghost story, but you can buy F. Marion Crawford's complete set of supernatural short stories under the title ""The Complete Wandering Ghosts"" for almost the same price. If you'd like more variety, read ""Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural,"" edited by Herbert A. Wise and Phyllis Fraser. The latter book is one of the finest supernatural anthologies ever published and it also contains ""The Screaming Skull.""There are probably other good anthologies that contain this story, so don't make the same mistake I did and acquire this Kessinger Publishing version. It is just one story, not the collected work of F. Marion Crawford, and if you buy it you too will be screaming, ""Rip off!"""
4,Tyler Perry's best movie,"This movie is by far the best movie Tyler Perry has ever done. It's also the most original and unpredictable. The friendship between Woodard and Bates was genuine. You could see that they had mutual respect for each other.I also enjoyed the relationship between the sisters and their spouses.A wonderful story about family, turmoil, and life."
2,"""Family that preys""","Love the movie but wasn't able to watch the movie,I downloaded thought it was complete but it will not play.."
4,The Family that Preys,"Tyler Perry does it again! This was such a good film, so dramatic, sad yet joyful all at the same time. It has a great cast with Alfre Woodard, Kathy Bates, Sanaa Lathan and Taraji Henson. All characters were unique and joy to watch. There is a twist in the story that you don't see until near the end of course.A must buy!"
1,RIP OFF,"Don't buy it unless you either already have ""POWER POINT"" software on you system or are willing to pay [PRICE]to purchase this software. Without ""Power Point"" you will not be able to use a computer to organize, create, or manage your shows. The editing features that run on the TV are poor ar best. When you copy from a Compact flash card to the zip drive it deletes the originals therefore you must copy these files to your computer before you copy to the zip drive All in All I sorry I got the thing!"
5,An excellent book on pattern drafting.,"I have had this book since 1985 and love it. There was a time when I drafted all my patterns from a sloper and pattern blocks and this is the book I used for my instruction. I was taught how by Mary J. Wadlington through the use of this book. Her style is casual and chatty, not formal and off-putting, and she often has notes on construction after the pattern alterations and drafting is done. To this day, when I want to design my own styles, I use what I learned in this book. I highly recommend The Custom Touch."
5,"Irrascible, Iritable, Controversial = Leo The Lip","Durocher never shied away from controversy while he was manageing, nor did he back down when he wrote this book. Read his candid (and less than flattering) opinions of Ernie Banks, Milt Pappas, Joe Pepitone and many others. It would be nice to have Leo still around to deal with the players union today. Bet there wouldn't be the labour problems that the sport has been plagued with !!!"
5,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!,"This is basiclly my favorite game! The game changes roles change when Peach sets off to rescue Mario, when he is held captive by Bowser, along with Luigi, and some mushrooms. He uses the Vibe Specter to do so. Peach heads off with a magic umbrella named Perry. This game has simple controls and is pretty chalenging, but not enough to make you really frustrated and fling your DS across the room. The bosses are entertaining and you have to think before you attack them. Girls (like me) can finally use Peach to save Mario. But for girls or even boys I think you should get it."
4,It's probably a good game but not for my daughter,"My 7-year old daughter has got tired of the game quickly (after 1 hour of playing). She complained, it's hard for her to understand all that jumping, princess mood changes, and tunnel escapes. Since I bought her the game for X-mas, she didn't pick it up again. I've checked the game myself and thought it should been fun, although I agreed with my daughter that all that jumping was a bit boring. I gues, my daughter is a bit too youg for the game, and I am too impatient."
5,At Long Last! Thank You Amazon.com!,"I've had this on my alert list for ages, and when I found the notice in my email... I can't even begin to describe the overwhelming joy. My heart literally skipped several beats. Miracles do happen, and this is a prime example. The Powers That Be have finally heard the pleas of the B&B fandom, and I know I'm not alone in pre-ordering this. After a decade and a half of waiting, what's a few more months? I was a mere child in love with the series when it aired, and was heartbroken when it was taken off. Now, for it come back to us in full DVD glory, it brings tears to my eyes. Domo arigato! Dua Netjer en ek(etj)! Danke! Go raibh maith agaibh! Gracias! Moran taing! Gratias! Multumesc! Merci! Nais! Grazie! Wa'-do! Xie xie! Thank you!"
5,Finally! Thank you Republic Pictures!,Easily one of the best shows ever on TV. I've already pre-ordered and can't wait to see this fabulous show in DVD quality. Could season 2 be far behind? I hope not!
5,At Last,"I have been waiting for years for this series to come out on DVD, and I have not been disappointed. Ron Perlman was made for this role, and he captures my heart now just as when the series was first aired."
5,AAAH!! It's about TIME!!!,"Twenty years have passed since I first saw this wonderful show on TV. I was actually watching it for a friend so I could tell her what happened (I had no spare tapes at the time to record it)...and I was beside myself by the end of the episode. Every Friday night at 8:00, my sister and I planted ourselves in front of the TV. We have all the episodes on tape; we didn't miss a one. And of course, twenty years of playing those tapes over and over have put me in a quandary because they were wearing out. How thrilled I was to see that Republic Pictures FINALLY gave the go-ahead to put this show on DVD. Please don't wait so long for Seasons 2 and 3. My Polaroid tapes won't last much longer!"
2,The straps are horrible,"My dad purchased this car seat for my son while on vacation this fall. He originally had a Cosco Touriva car seat and hated that one because the seat was not padded enough. The padding in the Evenflo car seat is decent for the price, but the straps are horrible. I can never get the right side to tighten. The adjustment bar is on the left side and will never tigthen the strap on them right. Other than the annoying straps the car seat is a decent seat for the price. All in all I would not recommend this seat because of the strap issue."
2,seems good but flawed,"I was going to buy this seat. I thought the padding was good. It seemed pretty comfortable, and it fit my daughter well. While trying it my only issue was that the tabs that you buckle fall through the hole to underneath the seat. So if they end up falling through the holes you would have to unbuckle the whole seat and start over, where some of the other have plastic inserts (graco&cosco do this)to prevent this problem. I was very disappointed because the price point was good and it seemed like a good car seat."
5,A bargain!,"This discontinued edition seems to be very similar to the current editionAgendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies, Update Edition, with an Epilogue on Health Care (2nd Edition) (Longman Classics in Political Science)(except for the epilogue on health care) but is much much cheaper. If you're looking to save, get this edition as it probably contains all you need for your class.All that being said, I fairly enjoyed reading this book. The author chooses a lot of examples to illustrate his point about the workings of policy and how different actors throughout the process have a different influence on policy formulation. The examples may seem a bit dated at this point but I feel that they still add value to how things work today."
4,An Honest Look at an Alcoholic Family,"I think this is about the best movie I have seen about how addiction impacts a family. Though it is a made-for-T.V. movie from the late 1980's, it feels very contemporary in terms of the story that it tells. It is especially poignant that the lead character is played by Martin Sheen. One has to wonder how he landed this role, and whether addiction runs in his family as well as in his character's.I think that a particular strength of this movie is how it depicts the impact that alcoholism has on the non drinking family members. Most movies about addiction and recovery (i.e., Clean and Sober, 28 Days, etc.) focus primarily on the addict. This is a mistake, as addiction almost always takes a toll on the whole family. This movie is well worthwhile. I highly recommend it."
1,Not very accurate,"Immersed in 175 degree water, this gauge read 215. Wire was supplied for illumination, but you have to supply 18 gauge wire to connect the sensor to the indicator, as well as 12 vdc and ground to the indicator. You also need to supply small nuts to connect the three wires. I returned the unit due to the lack of accuracy."
5,AMAZING CD!!!,"This CD is amazing! There are not many CD's where each song is great, but this is one where each song is worth it. Delta Goodrem has an amazing voice with great lyrics. Buy this CD, you will enjoy. Come on..GO BUY IT NOW!"
2,Not Exactly the Blue Fairy Book,"If you're only familiar with Andrew Lang from the [color] fairy books and are hoping for a book of tales, this isn't that.What it is is a scholarly position paper in a then-current debate over the nature and origin of mythology. Andrew Lang is attempting to refute the theories of Max Muller, who argued that mythology was ""a disease of language."" This book is Andrew Lang's refutation of that theory and endorsement of the countervailing theory that mythology is a survival from the misperceptions and reflexive animism of primitive peoples.I can only imagine this text being of interest to those who are truly *dedicated* to the study of comparative mythology."
5,"Wonderful DVD, helpful for AP biology","This is a fun way to learn some topics in biology. The visual technique is excellent for helping me to memorize important topics into my brain. It's a good reference for AP Biology. However, I would not only use this as the primary source. I also used Biology by Raven's and for great test-like questions, I usedThe Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with ExplanationsVolume 1 isbn; 1933023007Volume 2 isbn: 1933023015Volume 3 isbn: 1933023023These three study guides had similar questions to the AP exam. Raven' Biology is also needed because this helped me to build my foundation of knowledge in biology for the AP Biology Exam."
4,Action from the get go,"Strong, fast, realistic fights. Deep plot, and a strong cast. Some creative styles, and a group of villians that would make any movie good. solid film. a must for any wu tang collector."
4,much better than I expected,I was really suprised that this cd was not like Planet X in its excessively executed solos. It is a very solid album from the beginning to the end. I was also amazed by the fact that Simon Phillips actually let his parts breathe for a change. I only wish though that the keys would be a bit louder in the mix and not be lost to everything else that goes around it.
5,Stylin',"The thing I love most about this disc is the variation in style and feel on the tracks. Rather than sounding like a self-indulgent tech-fling, it moves at different speeds, displaying gorgeous textures and some serious moodiness. Unlike some other reviewers, I appreciated Derek's self-restraint in showing off his guest-stars chops and, to my ear, concentrating on developing beautiful arrangments.I was going to give this 4 stars, but since I went to school with Derek, I'm going to display my prejudice by giving it 5 :-)"
3,I spoke to Derek,"Derek may be a jackass in real life (or maybe just online), but these tracks are pretty good. If you're a big fan of his, don't IM him, because he barely shows any interest in his fans. If he was a nice guy, I'd buy this album in a heart beat, or I'd buy it just because Malmsteen and Sheehan play in it."
5,A living book on an arid subject,"The story of the privatzation of Manila Water and Sewage System doesn't look like an exiting subject, more the kind of book you read when you are in the water business, because it will be full of data, and you ""have to"". The entire contrary, the book is read as a novel, with dramas, questions and uncertainties up to the end of the process. That would make every book interesting, but there is much more: by clearly explaining how the Philippine Government has step by step overcome the problems encountered during the privatization process, this book is, for any administration willing to privatize water services, a catalogue of what to do (or not). Eventually, the book is also very useful for managers of private companies involved in the business of water privatization, as it gives an unique insight of the thoughts of the Civil Servants who had driven the privatization of MWSS."
1,More of a fantasy anthology than a horror anthology,This was disappointing -- it's much more of a fantasy anthology than a horror anthology.
5,outstanding quality!,Really lovely china. Good price. Nice quality. The subtle yellow and hints of green are nice.
4,I love suki,"I never saw benefits from any 'toner' i used over the years. i love suki, but i'm going to have to say that i'm not sure what this product has or hasn't done for my skin yet. i've been using it for about 2 months every day hoping to reduce red spots around my nose and eyes... and i follow the directions exactly. the smell isn't to die for but i can deal because it dissipates very quickly. i'm going to stick it out with this stuff because suki has never failed me in the past.. maybe i'm just expecting more of a noticeable result because all of the other suki products i try have astounding results almost instantly. i still love suki and will never try another product line again (please dont ever discontinue this stuff.. i dont know what in the world i would do)"
1,Erotic fiction narrated in the first person...,"... with all the seedy bits of a romance novel save the romance.Graphic depictions of child sexual abuse rendered this book revolting.Just to be clear, the ""real"" Mata Hari did not author this diary."
2,too chaotic!,"it might just me, but i found ""Chaos.."" to be a disappointing fairy tale about creatures in love with fractals. ""Chaos..""'s only message is that fractals are weird and kinda look nice as pictures. no effort was made to give us a consistent view of Pickover's fictional world, no character relationships, and no guiding theme (except strangeness).All i ended up with is a bunck of drawings and riddles, and eventhough i am a major in computer graphics and AI, this is absolutely unsufficient."
1,This book borke my record.,"I have always been patient. Once I picked a book, I will make myself finish it as a way to tell myself that my choice is correct and worthy. But sorry, could not do it with this one.The 1st 50 some pages were fine, but then it went downhill. A point made was repeatedly said, scenes were dragging, unnecessary script and telling like the Russian helicopter and the ride side tracked the story, the writer showed off too much with the poems/peotry...all made the reading bulky and dull. I did make an effort to convince the story would pick up later. However, if by finishing 1/3 of the book and it still could not intrigue me, reading which should be a pleasant activity turned to be a chore."
3,coming home,"not what I thought it would be.Iwould give it a rating of 75. too much language. Jon Voight was great, but I didnt like jane fonda."
4,Sound and Image,"It's no accident that several of the reviewers plead for information about where to find the soundtrack for this movie, which consists not of original music, but songs from the era. As far as I know, it's never been available, but this shows just how well the songs were selected and used in this movie. In particular, the use of Tim Buckley's ""Once I Was"" in one scene is so overpowering that I wondered for many years what the song was, and where I could find it, searching through used record bins for the (nonexistent) soundtrack album. There are several important themes in the film, all of which are discussed in other reviews, but the Buckley song expresses the feelings of Bruce Dern's character in a way that could not have been achieved any other way."
5,A treasure of information,Well written and researched. Very old and VERY informative. She tackles how the church took the pagan myths and holidays for their use and practice as a way to convert pagans. Very good read. Highly recommended.
4,"Good template guides, good price","I like these guides, I use them all the time. It kills me that anyplace charges more for these, as they are simple accessories. They fit well on my dewalt routers, no slippage, no machining irregularities. My only gripe is that they aren't very polished or laquered, so they scratch very easily. If they scratch badly, they could mar your work, but you could buf out any scratches with a little sandpaper. I recommend these highly though."
3,unbound,We have never received a book that was not bound. It seems like an unusual way to have a book and I doubt I would have purchased knowing this. It was not listed as such on line.
5,Won't put you to sleep!,"I was assigned this text for a college General Psychology course, and upon reading it cover to cover, I found that it was quiet interesting! The book uses simple terms so it is easy to understand what really matters, rather than trying to memorize countless definitions, and it has a story at the beginning of each chapter to help put each concept in perspective. In comparison to other dry, and complicated psychology books which I have had in the past, I highly suggest this book to anyone wishing, or forced to, study psychology."
5,Carol Burnett is the Best,"The skits, actors, songs, etc. in this Collectors Edition were priceless. I bought one for myself and one for a friend. They bring back a lot of memories and genuine laughter!!!! Would recommend this for anyone who watched The Carol Burnett Show years ago......."
5,My Mother in Law was THRILLED,"Got this for her and she is not a tv watcher, but she LOVED it. It's great to make someone smile from miles away. The dvd was clear, and the shows awesome."
2,Not as I remembered,"If you are looking for funny moments from the Carol Burnett show don't waste your money on this collection. While the collection has some funny moments, you have to sit through numerous skits which have not fared well with time. You would be better off looking for the ""Carol Burnett Show Stoppers"" which shows only clips then having to sit through this. Sorry, but it wasn't as funny as I remembered and these were suppose to be Carol's favorites."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a montage of different ""funniest"" clips; instead it was entire episodes. Guess I need to be more careful when reading descriptions."
2,Carol Burnett Dvd,The biggest disappointment was that there was no way of tracking what episodes were on the dvd's--there were nos for the episodes but did not follow any system I could find--unable to find desired episodes--would have liked each dvd to list exactly what was on it--
3,Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites (Collector's Edition),Carol Burnett Show: Carol's Favorites (Collector's Edition)I was quite dissappointed. I didn't care for all of the commentary and the musical skits that were not even sort of comical. I haven't made it through the whole first disc and am not looking forward to the rest of them.
4,I love it but I am biased...,"I grew up watching Carol Burnett and most people I talk to just love her. I bought this as a birthday gift for my roommate. I know what he's watching when I hear the laughter coming out of his room. This is the same collection offered on TV for $99.00. It was a lot cheaper on Amazon, however, the day after I ordered it, I found it at a membership type retailor for nearly $10 less."
2,Could've been funnier,"Seeing the previews, I thought this would be a riot so I bought it for my parents for Christmas. We started watching it together and the 1st skit was funny but after that we didn't even remotely laugh. We haven't made it through all of the CD's yet because we were bored with what we saw so far. I wish they would've put all of her hysterical skits on the CD's and skipped all of the other ""not so funny"" stuff. Wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
3,Carol Burnett,I was a little disappointed at the content..... I remember more funny episodes then what was on the DVD'S. It wasn't quite what I expected. The price was right though.
3,"Carol Burnett, my favorite tv Comic",I have only seen 2 of the 6 discs but they are okay. Not my favorites but I think they might be in the last 2 discs when Tim Conway became a regular.
3,Not so sure about this,"The first disc of this collection will not play. We probably should have returned it, but have been playing the others. Not sure what the problem is."
1,Boring,"Most Nancy Drews are VERY good. but this one was so boring that I couldn't pick it up. (oppaset of couldn't put it down.) It took me the longest time to finnish it, a week or more, and that's saying somthing because I nomally finish them in 1 or 2 days. The most exsiting thing was when Hannah was tyed to a chair. don't get this one, a diff. one."
4,Lego Fire Truck,Purchased as birthday gift for 6 y.o. grandson.. he and 13 y.o. brother had great fun putting it together! Good in combination with Lego fire house.
3,not much fun for a five-year old,"I had to put the pieces together and my five-year old played a little while and some pieces fall apart, he struggled a while to put them together and failed. Now he no longer touches these. He loves cars and loves play legoes, but this one may be too much for him. It took me quite bit time to put them together in the first place."
1,Not satisfied,"The pic looked nothing like the actual shoe. The plastic part on top of the shoe came so low toward the toes that it dug in and was uncomfortable. Also, I had read other reviews before purchasing, and many folks said to get a size smaller than you normally would wear. This was not a good idea. They were way too tight. They sit in my closet."
1,Very Odd Shape & Fit,"While I've been warned by other bikini competitors that these types of shoes will be tight at first until they stretch, these are not only way tight and uncomfortable...the toe is shaped extremely odd and extends way out in a pointy fashion. The strap across the toes is even more odd and seems like the shoes are rejects??? Not pleased at all. And of course, I'm expected to pay the return shipping."
5,A time to be missed,"As often I am call ""old school"" it was new and refreshing for me to read of the old Atlantic City. I thought Jon Van Meter brought back to life a time that has been dead far too long. I would strongly recomend it to anyone who loves the golden area in American history."
2,For Hardcore YES Fans Only...!,"I just picked up the DVD featuring Yes' appearances on musikladen, entitled ""Special Editions EP.""I would recommend buying this only if you're a hard-core YES fan and you can get it cheap. There's less than 20 minutes of YES stuff on there.Inexplicably, only half of the song ""All Good People"" appears on the DVD. The video quality is okay - not bad, but not great either. The psychedelic visual effects get annoying after a while as well.Also, while it is remastered in DTS sound, it's not the best DTS I've heard. Fortunately, it was only $10 at Best Buy. It does, however, have video previews of other DVDs in this series and bonus videos by Rick Wakeman (excerpt from Center of the Earth) and ELP, among others."
1,Infomercial Flair Disappointing,"Much of this ""special edition"" DVD seemed more like a commercial to sell me more stuff. While the three YES tracks were awesome, there isn't enough footage of the band members acutally playing. The rest of it wasn't really worth watching. Additionally, the design is awkward because you have to start every little thing separately ... no flow."
2,Serious let-down,"I have to be honest: I love Tales of Phantasia, but the Game Boy Advance iteration of the game was a major disappointment. The music was roughly the same, as good as it could be for the console, but the gameplay took a serious hit when ported to the GBA. If you are going to play this game, find the downloadable Super Famicom version or get the PSX version. Both of those are much better!"
3,Great design but...,"Loved these earrings online, but in person they were too small. I knew they had to be smaller than shown to fit in my ear, but these were significantly smaller and not proportional to my face. I ended up giving them to a pixie faced young friend who loves them."
2,very thin,I bought these for my wife. The earrings were nice but very thin and did not really shine....much smaller than I thought...may get attention but someone may need to be very up close to see them! Looks better in the picture than in real.
1,"A Fan of Both Irons and Ruben Blades, But ""CB"" Was the PITS!","I watched about the first excruciating half hour and then gave up. I am glad I did not get to the scenes of animal cruelty that some reviewers here made reference to -- then it would not have been just a bad movie, but a very, very upsetting one.What a waste of two fine actors, and a waste of an interesting idea. Screenwriters and directors just don't seem, many a time, up to snuff nowadays.Want a good Chinese-themed movie? Try ""The Last Emperor."" Based on a true story, and very well done.P.S. The movie really deserves NO STARS, but as we all know, that is not an option here."
4,Educational,I use this DVD for my 6th grade Star Spangled Banner unit. It helps the students realize some details about the flag and the Star Spangled Banner.
4,Works great,I bought this to use with one of the kits I got from drugstores and so far I think it works much better than the strips that come with the kit.
4,Cheap but is it worth it?,"We got this card at a very low price brand new. Holds very many pics and lots of video, but it does take a while to store a pic after taking one with our camera (olympus 740). We just wish it was a bit faster."
5,"Great card, great price!","I've had xD cards for a few years. I just got a new camera (FE-190) and needed more space to accomodate the larger mp's. This little card holds over 700 photos for a 6mp camera. Great card, great price!"
1,nhb,I never did recieve my replacement memory card from 17th st photo. i gave a negative review and they called me the next day asking me to retract my comments. so i gave them another review. this one never did appear on their web reviews. amazon promptly refunded the difference between the price of the 1gb card and the replacement 512mb but i never did recieve the product or a total refund.
1,Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers!,"Note Type M and H xd cards are incompatible with some card readers!I have a Fuji camera and bought an xd card type M. But it turns out that type M and type H cards are not compatible with all card readers (even ones that work with regular xd cards) so I have to use my cable and camera batteries to upload photos from my new card, or purchase a new card reader. Ugh!Buyer beware!"
2,Not so great.... 2 Stars are generous...,"After about ten uses in my compatible Fuji FinePix A500 the card won't format in the camera or computer. The last time is was used the batteries in the camera died while shooting, so I'm thinking that might have something to do with it.... Not worth the hassle... SD and CF cards have my future business..."
3,Caution,Be cautious ... this edited version is a research and study guide ... it is not the full text of the book!
3,From Back Cover:,"The hospital in Bayard need a doctor and pretty Libby Gilles was perfect for the job. She had just the right experience and more than the usual amount of enthusism... the trouble was, she also had eyes for every man on the staff."
5,to the gut,"i'm a long time E# fan...this is not as cerebral as it is a nice hearty punch to the gut - it's soulful, bluesy in the primal way...like an animal in heat...Queen E stands with Tina, Etta, Rosetta...it's a grand match, a great find."
1,Overpriced junk,"This pen case is greatly overpriced and of inferior quality. The fabric liner is very thin and feels and looks cheap. I will be surprised if the zipper lasts more than a few months. The label says it all - ""MADE IN CHINA"". I will never again buy anything from this vendor."
4,"just amazing. about as good, if not better than citizen toxie!","while terror firmer is nowhere near the excellence of the classic tromeo and juliet, it is very entertaining and gripping. also cheesy and hilarious. i recommened you dont show this film to sensitive viewers until you have built them up to this level of troma. to get someone into a troma junkie, i must say start with the first toxie and cannibal! the musical. then you can move up to tromeo and juliet and finally this monster! i really dig this new age troma crew with the likes of will keenan, ron jeremy,lemmy and the guy who plays jerry(i forget his name) and such. this is one of the three essential troma films of the new troma era. the other two being citizen toxie and tromeo and juliet.""dont give up the fight for truly independent cinema!"""
1,ioncetookatexantoawedding,"this movie is bad even for troma. its not gross or shocking or funny. it's very long, i think about 9 hours. i wasn't offended or entertained, just bored and i got diarhea. troma fans are overwight. i bought this movie and i can't get rid of it. i can't sell it to stoners, give it away to homeless people, or trade it for a banana at lunch. it didn't even come with the free poster promised on the case. also it breaks your dvd players"
1,The kind of music that killed jazz,"This is the kind of music that has contributed to the slow death of jazz as a mainstream American artform. It is grating, disheveled, irritating music (and I use the term ""music"" with great reservation) that will send the sensitive listener running to turn down the volume on his / her stereo.The disturbing nature of this recording is tailor made for the elitist pseudo-snobs out there who insist that there is actually something redeeming to be enjoyed in this type of jazz. Absolutely awful."
4,Tudo Ok,O CD já chegou e está em bom estado. O acrílico estava bem usado mais já troquei por um novo e o CD ficou bonito. Obrigado!
5,Great all natural toner,"Everyone in my family uses this. It is anti-acne, anti rosacea, and anti-redness. I use it twice a day under my moisurizer. Yet it is so gentle, it doesn't burn your eyes when you spray your face."
4,Cups,"I was expecting the cups with the word ""Gatorade"" on them, not just the ""G"". Other than that, the order was perfect, thanks."
2,poor quality,"I realize i didn't purchase a piece of fine jewelry but based on the reviews i was hoping to like it enough to wear when i don't want to wear my actual wedding rings. However quality is awful, it looks like it went through a blender. Its so cheaply made that i am embarassed to wear it. I will be returning this.The picture looks 10 times better than the ring did in person."
4,A quick look,"The Viking Portable D.H. Lawrence is a good collection of this authors poems,short stories, novellas, and other writings. I recommend it for anyone who already likes D.H. Lawrence, for anyone who likes British Modernism, and any one who likes to read finely crafted work replete with natural imagery."
5,Beautiful,My sister gave this figurine to me about a week before my wedding. I used it instead of the cake topper I had originally chosen and now it sits on my mantle. It's absolutely lovely and a wonderful keepsake.
4,mommy,It was Valentine's day gift for my husband. He liked it a lot. Only thing that I wish they could have a variety of hair colors to choose from.
1,very upset,"i was very upset about this order. i bought this item for my wife for valentines day and when she received it the girl had blonde hair, my wife has brown hair. it is something little but its the little things that matter. my wife did not like it and was very upset at me. im in the army and deployed in iraq right and have had to order every gift for my famly online. i think the seller should at least inform what the product looks like if it dont match the picture."
5,Great Gift for Expecting Wife,"My wife is expected and she is a collector of Willow Tree. As soon as I knew she was pregnant, I ordered this as a simply stated Mother's Day gift. She was genuinely touched by it and as with most Willow Tree gifts, the quality was excellent. This makes a great gift for an expecting family or a new family."
5,This made a beautiful gift,I think all of the Willow Tree figures are great. They really appeal to my sentimental side as a Father in a way that Snow Babies or other figures don't. This made a great gift for my wife.
5,sweet gift idea,"very nice gift idea. It's about the length of my middle finger, and looks well on the mantlepiece. If you're familiar with Willow Tree products, then you know there are a plentiful amount of figures to chose from. This went well with my collection."
4,Sisters,This is soo nice. I received it really fast too. I bought this for my sisters birthday and she loved it
5,Beautiful,"Great Product, Very elegant and beautiful. Simply put for a new family for a great baby gift. Packaged well and exceeded expectation."
5,Best Thermal Epoxy,"Whenever I build a new system (like the dual Opteron server I just finished), I always reach for the arctic silver to help with heat CPU heat dissipation. I have read enough studies and reviews to know that artic silver is the best thermal epoxy available.As a result, I've never had a processor shutdown because of thermal overload, even in less than optimal environments.Although it barely nudges out the second best thermal epoxy, artic silver is still the best."
5,Easy to use,This product exceeded my expectations. The online instuctions were easy to follow and accurate. The product acts like an epoxy but looks just like a silver solder. Great for jewelry applications when heating is not optimal. Highly recommended!
5,Works well!,This product bonds well and seems to transfer heat fine. It was easy to mix and apply to an aluminum heat sink. -Sol
5,Good book,"Bought this one for my husband who is from there....he truly enjoyed reading it, although, I don;t think he has quite read it all yet but the information is accurate and interesting."
4,Classic Water Bottle,This is a good classic water bottle.It leaks but it is cheap and does the job.I would buy again.
1,coverall mattress bag,These are useless!!! They split as soon as we put the mattress in them. I would never purchase them again
3,Fragile.,Buy one at Dollar Tree instead- this one didn't even make it onto the mattress without tearing. I didn't expect it to be fantastic- it just needed to keep dirt off of my mattress while we moved. FAIL.
1,oversized plastic garbage bag,"the bags ripped as we put the mattress and boxspring into them... by the time everything was into the car, the bags were shredded."
1,overpriced piece of plastic,"I thought this would at least have a zipper or something to seal it closed but it does not. It is a cheap piece of thin plastic that tore when I used it, you'd be better off using black garbage bags and duct tape, don't spend money on this."
1,Doesn't seal,"Don't waste your money on this bag. There's a reason it's so cheap... The bag doesn't seal! We had to use tape to close it! I don't see how they can claim to protect against bugs (etc.) in this case...Updated review:I originally gave this product two stars, but I'm reducing that review to one star. Not only does it not seal, but the plastic has torn in several places! This thing is really just too cheap. Don't waste your money! We are going to Home Depot to try to find a better one tomorrow... Doesn't seem to be a good selection available on Amazon..."
2,Disappointed..,I was disappointed it states that it seals tight yet it is completely open on the end.. NO WAY to close it...NO zippers or ties...Just a big GARBAGE BAG....
2,Disappointed,"I bought two queen sized bags for my queen size mattress and box springs. The queen size bag barely covers the entire box spring and falls short on the mattress. It looks as if the bag would fit if the corner seams were done differently, but the seams prevent the bags from sliding on completely. Had the bags fit properly they would have been perfect. They seem very durable. My recommendation would be to buy the next size larger."
5,Truly All Natural Recipes!!,"One of the problems I have with other books like this is that they only talk about vinegar and baking soda and lemon juice - or they suggest ingredients that are not natural at all! The great thing about this book is that it calls for using essential oils. GREAT cleaning power! And ALL of the ingredients suggested are totally natural. Nice presentation too, very informative. Thumbs up!"
3,Technical,"The text is very technical and difficult to follow if you have no background in MMPI. I'm using the text for a graduate course, and even the instructor acknowledged it's difficulty. If you use it as a beginner, try to find other sources to help. Overall, it has a lot of good information."
3,Doesn't the racism bother anyone?,"I found the book well written and the characters believable - but not likable. They were the rich family in the town and never seemed to grasp that their racist and elitist views were wrong. Only the yankee, Love, seemed to have any sense about how to treat those that were less fortunate, probably because she felt like garbage herself. I kept hoping the book would climax with the entire family learning that their position in their community didn't make it OK to look down and treat others so poorly. The idea that the mill workers were disgusting and that Black people just loved being the servants made the book hard for me to like. Although you had a sense that the author didn't agree with these views, the characters never seemed to get it."
2,Boring,"Cold Sassy Tree isn't a bad book, but unless you enjoy soap operas and gossip, you might prefer to keep looking."
2,Not my favorite,"Not my favorite book. I just didn't like the hokey speech pattern. I have read other books from the deep south, but this book didn't appeal to me. There were too many incidents that were supposed to be funny that didn't seem funny to me. It seemed too contrived. I rarely skip through a book but I ended up doing that very thing half way through. It didn't seem to matter where I opened the book, I could follow along. Sorry, I just didn't enjoy this book."
2,Hard to read,"This is a hard book for a teenage child. I have a college reading level and still found it difficult to understand. I had to read it for school and it took me about 4 and a half months to figure out the meaning.Once you learn the meaning, its a farily simple book, but learning the meaning can be tough. It takes time and i have asked many people what the meaning was, and have recived many driffent answers. So the meaning can be competly driffrent for you than it was for me, but over all, a VERY hard book to under stand.It does have some good meanings, and morals though I must crete the author with that"
3,Cold Sassy Tree,"My opinion on this book was it was an OK book. It was very hard to get into. It does not start getting good until the very middle of the book. The first was very boring. All it did was tell about the scenery and the different people in the book that were not even important to the story of the book. After all that, the book gets very interesting and heart filling. It means a lot to the different people who grew up like they did. It is a book that you have to get interested in, you can not just read it for the heck of it. It has to have meaning to you."
1,Poor choice for summer reading,"Required reading for my child entering high school, ""Cold Sassy Tree"" lacks coherent structure, elegant style, meaningful content, and deep characterization. The text plods and plods...yet it is as if the author skimmed a lexicon of Southern cliches, regional names, rejected soap opera story lines, and flea market items...and trusted every idea that came to her rather than culling weaker ones. Most characters are named once never to be seen or heard from again; others seem downright ""ornery"" or contradictory. The narrator's point of view (supposedly age 22 and looking back to his teen years) is unconvincing and uninteresting. Names like: ""Miss Love Simpson"" and ""Dr. Slaughter"" seem silly. The writer, a journalist who deserves credit for writing while ill, underestimated the leap to fiction. If you must read it for school, keep another book (by Harper Lee, Mark Twain, or William Golding--for example) nearby so that you don't internalize too many bad habits."
4,Good Book,This was my first book to download on my Kindle and I'm really enjoying it. It was recommended to me by my sister-in-law who said that if I liked The Help that I would like this book and I do.
4,excellent slice of southern,"I'm a big fan of the eccentric characters, petty ""wars"", and very real feelings under the humor and heartache in this book. Also, a fascinating peek into the mind of a turn of the century 14 year old boy."
1,Not a good read...,"Read it just to check out what our 11th grader was reading in high school English. I wouldn't recommend it as a book to purchase and read. In fact, if someone gives you a copy, save yourself the trouble and give it back...it was a really depressing read. Full of death, strife, and poor judgment. However, if that kind of thing appeals to you, along with derogatory slurs against black people, you might like it.In other words, a high school English teacher would probably love it."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This book is terrible. If you thought this book was good, then this must have been the only book you've read."
3,Good Price,"I ordered the redish brown pair with kind of a... burlap texture? And I used prime and got the shoes really fast, but i didnt get the pair i ordered, i got a solid red pair made out of plether, i do i like them a lot. But i would like to have got what i ordered."
5,Very Nice Metal Album,"I until recently had not heard of Motograter until I saw them at Ozzfest 2003. This band was one of the best bands on the second stage. They were everywhere and very entertaining to watch. I had no other choice to go and buy the album the day after Ozzfest. I was quite afraid that the album might not be half as good as them live, but this album really rocked......HARD. I recommend this album to all metal-heads."
3,An important beginning....,"...especially since even now the leading cause of women going to emergency rooms in the U.S. is domestic violence. Having worked as a counselor in the DV field for some years, I've seen the damage done and know it to be vastly underestimated, statistically and otherwise, even now. Walker led the charge against the kind of denial and victim-blaming that would claim the entire mess--which amounts to nothing less than terrorism in the home--is some kind of mistake, miscommunication, family problem, or lie."
4,Great Every day Cloth,"Great geometric pattern woven into the fabric. I have only straight lines in my house and this pattern went well in the great room. Good color with my other furnishings, and a good match with accent pillows and leather chair in great room. I wish the hem treatment had been a bit nicer, but OK for every day use. Overall, very pleased with the cloth. I may get a larger one for the times when we have the extra leaf in our table."
3,tablecloth,"The item is fine, was worth the price. Would not pay anymore than I did. I am happy with it."
3,"resists spills, but tends to slip off the table","This tablecloth has two very useful features for those with small children: it does a remarkable job of resisting spills, and it holds up beautifully in the wash. However, it also has a feature that is not so good - the table cloth slides off our hardwood table at the slightest pull, sending plates, cups and food flying."
5,Miracle for Feline Herpes,My 7 year old rescue cat has feline herpes with frequent outbreaks unless she is given 250 mg of NOW Foods L-Lysine twice daily. I open the capsule & mix half of it in her food. Easy does it.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"About 6 months ago I purchased 3 of these coils for my Firebird, after only a couple of days 2 of them went bad!! I had them replaced with the help of the amazing Amazon customer service! Then about 3 months ago I started to notice that my car was skipping, I check the coils and now I'm going to have to replace all 3 coils again!!What a waste of money!! Now I know why the local parts store's only give you a 90 day warranty on the Accel parts!! If you buy this part, ha,ha Good Luck!!!!"
2,Works great but fails quickly,"I bought these to replace my stock coils on my Monte Carlo. They worked great at first and then 4 months down the road I had misfires. I did extensive troubleshooting to include my O2 sensors since I doubted a brand new coil could go bad in such a short time. I replaced all sparks and wires, then I eventually tried putting on my old stock coils. At that point I found a nice corrosion mark on the ignition control module right beneat one of the coils. The coil started firing through the bottom rather than through the post. I would suggest only buying these if you are looking for a temporary performance fix, but not if you plan to keep your car running for the long haul."
5,Great CD,This is one of the best CD's I own. I had bought it for my brother a few years ago and loved it so much that I had to buy one for myself. It is Darrell Scott and Tim O'Brien at their best. It is simple and straight forward and not overproduced. It's like you are sitting and listening to them singing live in a personal concert.
3,Standard,"Typical western not many twists and turns. Though predictable pleasant enough way to waste some time. Bad guys die, good live happily into the future."
3,Satisfactory melodic metal album,"If you enjoy melodic European heavy metal, this is a moderately satisfactory album, with no innovations a all in any department,but very professionally performed."
4,Douglas At His Best,"If you love Michael Douglas' work in ""Wonder Boys"" you will love ""Solitary Man"". This is his best performance in years. Douglas plays a flawed man coming to terms with his mortality.A solid supporting cast makes this a memorable film."
