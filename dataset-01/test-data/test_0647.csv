1,Not really usable as intended.,"This is a nice little pouch for the money, except that it is meant to be installed with sheet metal screws. That means with my old pickup, I would have screw points sticking outside the body. Kinda think the description would have mentioned that little fact. I assume some trucks have double wall construction, but don't really know of any. I have an idea to use this pouch with a behind the seat storage box that I want to build. Should work well for that. DOES NOT work as described, though."
3,long & black,"This fit nicely behind the truck seat and a lot of pockets hold a lot of stuff, but after a year it's starting to tear in a few places"
4,I Personally Found it to Be Interesting but Also Boring,"In order to make this book interesting the author had to fill the book with his traveling experiences in his mission to find out who the real Santa Claus was and if he existed. I found it painful to read and wanted to get straight to the historical facts which were sparse but interesting to read about. He didn't use the easiest of language which made the book even more painful to read.I'd recommend this book as a Christmas gift to history buffs and ones who are into poetry or Shakespeare, because the author uses similarly difficult language."
1,One major pain to reload the laminate,"We have this thing at work, and it takes 20 minutes to reload on a good day. Tonight, we are having problems with the 2 rolls of laminate getting stuck together and the laminate rolling around one of the guide rolls instead of pushing through the machine. It has taken hours to problem solve and try to fix."
1,DO NOT BY EyeQ,"If there were a negative star rating I would have given that. Bottom line is I was shipped a faulty product and Infinite Mind refused to stand behind it. The software appears to have been written during Windows 3.x days and is not very compatiable with current versions and the license verification requires to you to put the original CD in to run the program. Too old school, too unreliable and no company support only adds up to one thing in my book. DO NOT BUY EyeQ."
3,GREAT product BUT I wouldn't buy it again,"After paying a LOT of $$$$$$$ for this program, and then replacing my dead XP computer, it no longer works. Now I have to buy an upgrade disk to make it compatible with Windows 7. ouch! At the price they charge, one would think that they would have a fix without charge. But no, I can either upgrade at a price or pay Microsoft $80.00 to upgrade windows to Pro edition so that I can run Virtual XP - which their website says will fix the problem.If they won't stand behind their products, why spend the $$$$$$?I was never disciplined enough to get to level 7 - where I was supposed to start working on comprehension, but my reading speed with pretty decent comprehension increased significantly, but I was a fast reader to begin with."
2,No help from EyeQ,"You are on your own with this product. I ordered the eyeQ vocabulary builder and have had nothing but problems from the start. No instruction, driver problems with installation and no help from customer service have made me regret ever purchasing this product. Unfortunately it's now past 30 days and I am stuck. Hopefully this note will prevent others from making the same mistake."
1,Jon Pertwee is humorless and self-important,"I have never seen any episodes of the sixth Doctor, but of all the Who I've seen, Jon Pertwee is the absolute worst. He takes himself so seriously that the inherent absurdity of ""Doctor Who"" is reduced to a ponderous and tedious trial of the senses. His total lack of humor is so at odds with the goofy plots and ridiculous monster costumes that it is impossible for me to enjoy his episodes. I think he saw himself as a ""Danger Man"" character, and he portrayed the Doctor with all the seriousness that Patrick McGoohan did in his series. ""The Mutants,"" in particular, is so long I couldn't make myself finish it when it got to Part Six. It's not that complex a story, and could have been wrapped up in the conventional four parts--three, if there had been any mercy. Jon Pertwee--worst Doctor ever."
2,KISS The Immortals,"I wish I'd read the reviews before ordering this DVD from another source. Like everyone else I was really disappointed that the story stopped before it had hardly started. I would imagine this would be due to other people doing the voices rather than Paul/Gene/Ace/Peter at this point in the webisodes. What you get is good, but taking into account the cost with NZ's lousy exchange rate, if I'd known the you only get part of the story I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"To me, this one is a knock-off. I used recently eau de cartier and I decided to go for my second bottle but ohh surprise...","To me, this one is a knock-off. I used recently eau de cartier and I decided to go for my second bottle but oh surprise...this one does not smell like my previous one and it lasts very little. Cartier is a brand name! This version of the perfume does not seem to be a Cartier one."
5,Enlightening,"Rich in detail and meticulously researched this is an outstanding representation of an amazing man, his more amazing life and the trials and tribulations of free thinking individuals of the time. It's almost as if you have time travelled back to the eighteenth century ;)"
4,A wonderful insight into the heart of the crisis,"After all those years of looking at photos taken around the time of the Cuban miissile crisis of Kennedy and his advisors, deep in conversation, it's great to finally find out what they were talking about. What comes across is the perception and early understanding of the position they faced and their clear sighted thinking as they sought to come to grips with it. I was interested how the idea of the quarantine developed from almost an aside into the first line of policy. What is impressive throughout is how President Kennedy himself was able to ask probing questions, guide discussion and appear to be the only one to have a thorough understanding of all the influences and pressures. He was particularly strong in resisting hasty pressures to invade, a decision for which we can all be thankful now."
4,Letters For The World,"Too often we focus our hatred and anger on an entire people, when what we really hate is something that was precipitated by their government. We rarely see the people on the ""other side"" who are caught up in the situation and used as weapons. This gives us the opportunity to know the people for what they are; people with feelings and hopes and fears who do not necessarily hate us. It gives us the opportunity to choose to not hate the weapon, but hate the ideas and ideologies behind the person who wields the weapon."
4,Not your typical war movie (HD DVD),"Lets talk about the HD DVD version. Solid sound and video. The HD DVD has no glitches, uses the new menu.The movie per se does not glorify war instead there is always a sense of doom and depression hanging from above. This movie does not glorify war. This movie is not about the brotherhood that forms when people fight a war (ie Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers). Like its brother flag of our fathers it shows how war sometimes uses big pretenses to get their soilders and nation behind them. In the end, war is a sacrifice our soilders make at a high cost. I think the movie very carefully asks the question: Is the sacrfice worth it?"
3,Not Eastwood's master work,"The flip side of ""Flag of Our Fathers,"" this Japanese language film is a little too long for its own good. The tale told from Japan's perspective grows a little tedious, but you do see things from an alternate point of view. The praise is somewhat unwarranted, because, ultimately, there is nothing especially revealing or surprising here, just an expected take on what it must have been like to be a Japanese soldier on Iwo Jima. Worth watching in tandem with the other film, at your leisure."
2,"Nothing special, overrated.","The movie drags from the very beginning. The action does not start until about half way through the movie. The movie is boring. There are many better war movies out there than this one. I would not suggest buying this movie, if you must watch it, you should rent it and save your money. The movie is much worse than the trailer, don't let the trailer and the reviews fool you like it fooled me. Now I gotta find some way to get rid of the movie and at least get some of my money back."
5,Amazing,"Has a greater indictment of war ever been made? Perhaps Gallipoli or Breaker Morant, Das Boot, but, I don't think so. I came out of the theatre stunned into silence. Before this movie I have never felt a glimmer of sympathy for the Japanese in WWII. This is a poignant film that speaks to the horror of all wars and the unity of all mankind."
4,The enemies are human too.,"Might I say a standard ""the enemies are human too"" movie with some dabs of Japanese culture thrown in. I watched as I enjoyed the small amount of exposure to Japanese culture. Obviously, much better production values than were used in the John Wayne days.-- Louis J Sheehan"
5,Marines in Action,"I thourly enjoyed the movie, it really tells the true story of so many Marines dying on such a small peice of real estate, and was this real estate really that important or were these young Marines espendable while the Generals who sat far in the rear got all the hoopla."
5,Great Movie,"I liked this movie a lot, it is extremely historically accurate. I don't have a clue why there is so much buzz about the movie showing the ""humanity"" of the Japanese. In my opinion this truthful account of the battle shows plenty about the deranged brutality of Japanese culture during this period, and it's wonderful that they lost the war and a shame that so many Americans had to die in order to accomplish that objective. Of course the Japanese were humans and had families and certain common emotions, and I suppose viewers can reach whatever conclusions they wish from that obvious fact, even if it means ignoring all the other facts surrounding the battle and the war. But I'm giving a good rating for historical accuracy, not for opinions generated by the movie."
1,Satan's water heater,"If I could give this a negative star I would. You could never let a small child take a shower with this thing even when it worked ok, any flow change and it goes completely cold or hot. What a piece of junk, customer service is non-existant. Three service calls and its still leaking, water so hot you can't stand it, trouble codes in the LCD screen, had the software updated. I had to have it replaced with old fashioned tank type heater and I am getting the states attorney involved, I'm out 2000 bucks over this thing. DO NOT BUY ONE!!!!!"
5,SUMMER SLAM /VENGEANCE,"SUMMERSLAM IN WASHINGTON D.CMATCHES SO FAR. HBK VS HULK HOGANY2J VS JOHN CENAVENGEANCETHIS IS THE BEST PPV OF THE YEAR.BETTER THEN JUDMENT DAY O5BETTER THAN NO WAY OUT 04,05BETTER THAN SMACKDOWN .RAW DOES IT WITH A HELL OF A PPV.EDGE VD KANE HHH VS BATISTA HIAC/HBK VS ANGLE CARLITO VS BEJAMIN\\ Y2J VS CLB VS JOHN CENA\BEST PPV OF THE YEAR SO FAR, NO LET DOWN /ALL MATCHES DELIEVER GREATACTIONget this wwe raw ppv ,from vengeance,,hottest dvd on netflick /wrestling"
2,Good show.Cheap dvd.....,"Seeing i'm rating the dvd an not the PPV itself i give it 2 stars.In this day an age of dvd's having no extras is complete crap.Its bad enough WWE wants to make there PPV's nothing more then 3 hour smackdowns or Raws.An they charge the same for there dvd's an ppvs but are giving the fan less.They have so much footage in there vaults that not using some of the old footage makes me sick.If they don't think adding extras of todays footage is worth the trouble,then how about digging up classic stuff as extras.SuperStar Billy Graham was at summerslam,,lets see some classic Superstar Graham footage on the summerslam dvd.Its better then having nothing making the dvd less worth buying....."
5,Good book to read,This book was informative and filled holes in my personal knowledge of hiking and being outdoors. I was able to utilize the knowledge though my adventures in the wild.
1,"This video is a joke, don't buy it... you'll be disappointed","I bought this video set because I wanted to learn more about import/export. It is a 'home movie' of the author speaking in a classroom of approx. 10 students. Let me review the good points first:1) the video contains alot of good 'basic' information like terminology of the business, & sources to find business contactsNow for the bad points:1) the production value is terrible... some guy shot this with a handheld camcorder2) sound is almost nonexistent because they are in a room next to the San Diego airport & every 2 minutes a plan goes overhead and you can't hear the speaker3) the speaker uses a dry erase board, and his pen is out of ink so you can't read what he's writing4) the speakers presentation is stiff & boring, and he fails by not giving personal stories or anecdotes to illustrate the the 'ins & outs' of the import/export business... you won't be motivated to do anything after seeing this video"
2,Edition For Kindle Fire Bad for Maps,"I would have liked this book on my Kindle Fire, but the maps are unreadable. Zooming in on them does not help as they are too blurry to read. Terrible engineering and too bad as I would have liked to use this for my trip."
3,Porn vs. sex,This tale like other Deaver stories is a mix of unrelated porn and mystery themes. Forget the boring sex Mr. Deaver and get on with a better swtory.
4,"Great suspense, dialogue","I just love Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme books and began reading some of his other books. This one was easy to get into and very heart-jerking when character John Pellam's friend is blown up in a van and accused post-mortem of being involved in drugs. As seems a bit unusual, the death causes Pellam to be fired from his film producing job, but that's OK because it gives him time to solve his friend and co-worker's death. He's certain it's murder, and he's right. He also gets a taste of small town life in the process. Highly recommended!"
5,Amusing origami at its best,"This book is clearly designed to amuse. Most of the subjects are not serious, but rather a humorous or otherwise twisted take on classic origami. A few of the steller models include the pocket knife (folding, complete with multiple utensils) and nail-clippers. Other interesting models include a box with four classic cranes built into the lid, a surfer on a wave (action model) and the invisible duck (to be folded out of invisible paper of course, the wackiness of the book is evident here).Overall grade:8.6 out of 10Recommended to everyone who doesn't require serious models. Plenty of models to challenge all skill levels."
5,it doesn't sound like a bootleg at all,"A word about the allegedly bad sound-quality: As mentioned elsewhere, the ""bootleg"" portion (2nd half of CD 1 & all of CD 2) was taken directly from the mixing board and sounds really great, at least to these ears. In terms of sound-quality, it's about as good as LO '79. Sure, it's a bit rough around the edges but that's precisely what makes it so valuable! The musicians play with added verve and looseness because they probably didn't suspect the tape was rolling. Simply put: If you enjoy the studio versions of these songs, you'll get a real kick out of this ""bootleg""."
1,this is the dumbest book I have ever read,In twenty years experience in martial arts this is the dumbest book I have ever read.
5,Great Gift Idea,"I ordered this on a Friday and received on Monday. It came nicely packaged and was so much fun to open and look thru all of the different candy's from the past. Yes, some are not necessarily from the 80's but they are still candy's from childhood. I thought there was alot of candy and the variety was good.I will purchase this in the future as a gift idea. What a fun gift to open and share with a group!!"
4,"kids love them, parents appreciate goodie book","I purchased the set as a goodie book (one book for each kid) for my son's bithday, to the children in his class and for the children who came to his birthday party. They love it and the parents appreaciate it as well."
5,Magic Tree House books,I ordered this series of books for my grandsons 7th birthday. He loves the books. They arrived very promptly in time for his special day! Thank you. Donna Partyka
5,great stories!!,"My son got this as a xmas gift. Loves the stories. You can't go wrong with this selection. If your child likes adventure books, may I also recommend another exciting fictional bookSmitty's Cave Adventures"
5,Great books to read to/with the beginning reader.,Sever-year old grandson enjoys being read to and reading to adults. This is the perfect series: a slight challenge with new words but sentences that make sense and make him want to get to the next page.
5,Magic Tree House Box Set 1-4,My Grandaughter will be reading the books this year in school so I gave her a head start.
5,A gift for my nephew,"My nine year old nephew mentioned an interest in reading these books, so I gave them to him for Christmas."
1,I wish it were as good as it looked,"Another compilation by the now defunct Moon Records, and now you can understand why. I remember when Moon Comps were interesting, but this is just rubbish. You can tell when a record company is desperate for cash, and this just sounds like a money driven release. They should have paid attention to the music more than the CD cover."
3,I really wanna read more about Pimp,The book was really good to me. The Sex scenes were kinda the same ...But the action was crazy and had me on edgy. But there was one character who have my attention and that was Pimp. That dude was the devil in flesh and needed holy water thrown on him. I really wish Noire could write a book just for Pimp ...I wanna be in his mind and see what mad him so evil. Hopefully one day this will happen
1,Give Me A Break!!!!!,"I cannot believe anyone really enjoyed reading this book. The storyline was very slow. This book was very easy to put down and forget about it. What was the point of Carmeshia going through all that Drama with Thug's cousin when Thug never found out about any of it? There were just so many parts of the story where you would have thought Mr. or Mrs. Noire would have tied up at the end, but never did!!!!!!.....And the way the book ended was just horrible!!!!!! This book was so bad, I'm to the point where I will never buy another one by this author. ...And yes, I have read Candy Licker and G-Spot (Those books were o.k.). I just can't take the risk of being tortured by another Thug-A-Lious story!!!!!"
5,Redemption....,"well i finished the book and if it was a repeat i said i was gonna put Noire on blast...well it wasn't a repeat....but ima put her on blast cause girlfriend did the dayum thang....yeah she has redeemed herself and came thru with flying colors...i was a little concerned in the beginning but ole girl handled her business...i truly truly enjoyed this book. In the beginning i was a little concerned but Noire came thru. This book is unlike GSpot and Candy Licker. Noire has written a novel that will make you angry, shriver and become concerned and in the end... love does prevail... for some....is this book a book of your reap what you sow, well ya gotta read it for yourself, but know that it is a book that will have you turning the pages and longing for even more...Yeah, my girl has come thru this time....good looking Noire..."
2,can't finish,I bought this when it came out. I'm still trying to get through it. Maybe one day I will be able to complete this. Noire didn't get it right this time.
4,Speedy Service,This supplier sent my book in a timely manner and it was in great condition! A+ rating from me!No complaints.
2,"To practical, a lot of nonsens","I purchased it since I would like to understand the background of the topic in-depth. I was rather disappointed about the academic level of the book. Too American, which in my view is, a lot of practical paper-filling cases but lack of real theory.Not really interesting therefore for my knowledge building"
1,No suction at all,"This is cute but total crap. You squeeze the bulb and it just stays squeezed. Doesn't suck at all. I was in Babies R Us looking for one that worked as good as the blue one I got from the hospital, but this is definitely not it."
1,Cute but NOT functional,"This is a great idea and is super adorable, but definitely only for looks. This aspirator is not functional at all. Save your $2!!!"
3,Not THAT good,"I got this as a gift before and am still looking for refills or supplies for it.For something that seems to be based on interchangeable tips, its not that refill friendly.The good:The ink is excellent and the tips flow fine.Switching between tips is easy and fast, they can even be used without the main holder when needed for minimal things.The case is compact and durable.The bad:My problem with it is that after applying a decent amount of pressure when using, one of the finer tips broke and now its practically useless.They also dry up pretty quickly when uncapped.It is WAY WAY overpriced. This shouldn't cost more than 15$ if you can't even replace the ink/fills.I would not really recommend it."
1,Not what was pictured,"I purchased this air freshner because I needed some more for my vehicle. After looking around on Amazon, I saw this deal for this product deeply discounted along with a picture of what appeared to be a 24 pack, so I bought it. After receiving the item, there was only one. I feel as if I was baited and switched. It was sold by NorAm International Partners, Inc. The item was car freshner 10189 Little Tree Air Freshner - New Car."
5,Great for Color Dilution Alopecia,"When our blue, tan and white Chihuahua was two he started losing most of his blue hair. The white and tan sections remained fine. Two local vets were useless, painful tests for mange showed nothing, and many hours of Google searches later we happened upon Color Dilution Alopecia, which affects ""blue""-coated dogs. The blue color is a harmless genetic defect that sometimes results in sudden hair loss. The remaining hair is sparse and coarse.Another website recommended this shampoo and it works really well to keep his skin soft and healthy. It won't bring back his gorgeous blue hair, but Nova Pearls at least keeps him comfortable."
2,My Hero is a zero,"well now this is just plain stupid, the doctor that Janet works for is annoying, her parents are annoying, the drugged out hippie that always calls in on George is annoying. I do not know what to make of this strange show."
1,Shocking Theology!,"Gwen Shaw in her book titled ""The Law of Angels"" presents the reader with shocking theology. First of all, this book has very little to do with angels and the only significant reference to angels is found on page 41. Next, we see Shaw explain that she believes in the pre-existence or trans-migration of souls as found on page 68. Here Shaw writes that we ""always were"" and that we were ""part of God"" since the beginning of time and that we have no ""beginning or ending."" Next, on pages 67, 165 and 166 Shaw writes that Adam was created by God as an androgynous hermaphrodite and that Adam's womb was taken out of him and from this, Eve was created! Finally, Shaw writes this book with the thesis in mind that Christian women have a greater capacity to express the ""love of God"" therefore, because of their superiority to men, women will be used by God to ""usher in His kingdom.""This book contains very serious theological error."
1,Completely useless,"I had to buy this book for a graduate course in statistics. I stopped reading it around chapter 4. It does not teach you about behavioral statistics at all, unless you have extensive previous knowledge about the material. My classmates also found the book completely useless. I paid over $70 for it and now I can't even sell it online b/c it has no resale value. A lot of money went out the window....."
4,Good product,Good product. Fit perfectly and was easy to install. Works great. Just as advertised. Great factory replacement in my 07 VW Passat.
1,I Received A FAKE!!!!,"This is my wife's favorite perfume, when we received it and opened it yesterday for her BDay, the glass was not clear, the labels were off, the color of the liquid was off, and it was for sure not the same smell....It even smelled horrible, this was clearly a fake."
3,Acceptable,"Acceptable Ska, but the album is dominated by loud unmelotic voices that distract from the rhythems rather then compliment them. Many tracks start well and then the singing starts. This CD is on par with Sublime. There are just better Ska bands: Ska-alites, Wicked Wicked Pepper, Brave New Girl, Save Farris, etc."
2,genius Baby mobile,"My baby loved the mobile, but one of the colored triangles fell off after a few days. I would have recommended the item, but the fact that it broke so easily makes it a less desirable item."
4,Kid loves it,"Kid loves it, no problems with assembly. Great mobile for the price. The only negative is the arm feels kinda flimsy, but we haven't had any problems with it."
4,Tartan hit it on the head,"I agree completely with Tartan Mercer's review. I went one step further and shut off the Reading Festival portion when Barney started whooping it up during his hideous rendition of 'Isolation'. Understandably bands get numb to their own songs after playing them live hundreds of times, but I don't consider Ian Curtis' lyrics something to give lip service to. Either sing it with some heart or don't sing it at all.I also wasn't thrilled by the typical rock-star antics on stage. Of course they can do whatever they want up there and a lot of people love them for it. I only wish these two concerts weren't placed side by side on the same dvd as it is like watching two very different bands. I just don't happen to care for the second band all that much.I give this dvd 4 stars because the 1981 segment deserves 7 and the Reading festival 1."
3,Not enough information for new puppy owner,"I tried the paper training taught by this book for my puppy which didn't work as well. The book didn't provide enough solutions for many circumstances. But the personality and FAQ sections are good! I believe you will need another sources for complete puppy guide. You may want to check out ""The perfect Puppy"" by Gwen Bailey. It seems like a good book. I just ordered one from Amazon."
5,An excellent guide for first time puppy owners,"This book is extremly helpful in assisting the reader in choosing, training and living happily with your puppy."
1,PRODUCT IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED,"The bucket and plastic are fine, but the hose attachments leak and are of poor quality. The plug at the bottom of the bucket is also poor quality and leaked from day one. However for the price if you want the bucket only and then get your own hose replacement and plug replacement you can make it work, but by the time you do that you might as well by a better waterer."
4,"Great season, keep 'em coming","If you like adventure games, this is a great game, but if you're a Sam and Max fan, you must own it.The Pros: It's Sam & Max, the stories are fun, voice acting is quite good, graphics are good (for the genre) and the music is superb.The Cons: Some episodes are too short and the puzzles could be more challenging. The overall story arc is good but is tied up too fast."
5,Vital and Invigorating,"Steve Tibbetts and Marc Anderson play on a couple of cuts on this CD, several cuts of which were recorded in Tibbetts's studio in St. Paul. There is also some mandolin work by Peter Ostroushko, whose name will be familiar to Prairie Home Companion fans. Nice to see these musicians working together to help each other shine! Dean Magraw is a guitarist who not only plays well, but who also has a knack for picking music from a wide variety of sources and making them all sound fresh and exciting. Broken Silence includes compositions by Don Cherry, Vince Guaraldi, and Charles Mingus, as well as some rewarding original compositions by Magraw himself. I'm not quite sure whether to call this music jazz or folk, but I am sure that I can call Dean Magraw a wonderful musician who has made a vital and invigorating recording."
1,wrong,I was sent the wrong version plus it had a lot of writing in it. I had to do without this semester.
2,Not Fabulous!,"This book has very simplistic designs! I was disappointed by the styles in here and the majority are not something that I would make or wear. As with all books, I always pick-up some useful ideas or techniques. What I did like was some of her bead choices. She used unusual beads and chains that I will now be on the lookout for!"
5,Nuyoriban Soul THE REMIXES,"This ambum is maximun expression of the NY Soul, contain two greats version of ""I am the black gol of the sun"" and ""Runaway"" This is great becouse allways when I listen my soul is happy and free. Hey guys buy this album is excellent."
4,halloween costume,I bought this costume for Halloween. It is a bit boxy but ...it is supposed to be a house after all.
2,Not for Audi or larger caliper brakes,"I guess you get what you pay for, but 1) No sign that its made in the USA as other reviewers note; 2) Its small and will NOT work on larger caliper brakes; 3) Not of amazing quality like other reviewers note. Seems a bit cheaply made actually. Its going back."
2,The Thrasonical Hobgoblin: Madness is Subjective,"This book is hardly the ideal ""mad scientist in suburbia"" tale. It was read in one sitting...literally. I did not move from underneath the covers of my bed, but my wanton lethargy was not the result of an example of riveting literature. The book didn't need to go atilt on the BSA. Wasn't a rant--WAS a distraction. The tale just wasn't very interesting. Pragmatism must acquiesce to the rapture of dark allegory, and morbid chuckles were my anticipation. Look at the title; how could I reasonably anticipate anything else?? BLAH."
5,Extraordinary,"Wonderful lecture on creation and sacredness. On occasion it is difficult to see how the subthemes tie together, but Bell stays consistently engaging throughout."
3,the only book of its kind,I haven't yet read all the way through but it seems extremely down to earth and conversational--two qualities not usually found in a technical manual for a computer program. Wait for v.7 which is just about coming out now...
3,grandmom,"i like the size and strapon bongo but the actual skin on top seems very flimsy! im afraid when i let my 2 year old hit this he will break it open. also i ordered the sticks from another site because it didn't say one came with it, BUT one actually does come with this bongo."
2,Digital Coin Sorter,This item was a bit of a disappointment. It jams often and counting of the coins is not very accurate. If I had it to do over I could have purdchased a coin counter for half the price and probably would have been happy with it.
4,Digital Coin Sorter,"This particular digital coin sorter is considerably better than the higher priced coin sorter (selling for over $70.). It shows how many coins and how much in cash total are in each of the coin value windows, It also appears to be built to last longer. The only downside is that it takes awhile to realize that you have to pull out the drawer to obtain the coin storage tubes. Once you have accomplished this, it is easy to access the tubes.The other slight downside is that you are not quite positive when you have reached the maximum amount needed to fill a particular coin roll when there is an overflow of coins. However, this is no different from most other coin sorter."
3,Excellent until the end,"Wilson continues his award-winning style and pacing, as well as the intense rendering of Ben Justice's climb from his pit of self-destruction. The mystery plot begins strong, yet it plummets to a disappointing cliché ending. Justice is hired to write a book refuting claims that a dead Hollywood star was a pederast. He finds the star's daughter dead and seeks her killer. Along the way he stumbles into a boy trade reaching into the highest levels of Los Angeles's social structure. The problem I had with the plot was the actual culprits and their reasons for doing bad things. It was just such a let-down from what I was expecting from Wilson's level of excellence. I am happy with the characterization of Justice, most especially his achievements on the road to recovery. I hope the next in the series overcomes this stumble."
5,I now drink really hot coffee,"I've used this coffeemaker for two days and I at last have a HOT cup of coffee. The flavor seems fine, fast brewing, wonderful shape (saves counter space), carafe is easy to hold on to, filter basket swings well out of coffeemaker for easy paper filter insertion. I tried a thermal carafe coffeemaker and the coffee just never got hot. I have a Kitchenaid 4 cup coffeemaker, which is actually two cups. This is clean efficient design-reminds me of something from IKEA. So far, I'm very pleased."
4,It brews excellent coffee,"I bought the Presto Scandinavian Design Coffee Maker after reading the Amazon reviews. I am 100% satisfied with it. I grind coffee beans before each use and think that the coffee is delicious. The coffee maker is easy to set up, operate, and clean. The carafe pours well with no unexpected drips. The little clock isn't easy to read, but it works well. The coffee maker uses #4 cone shape filters and none come with the coffee maker so plan ahead. I am totally happy with this coffee maker."
3,Presto Scandinavian Coffee Maker,It does make nice hot coffee and the machine operates without difficulty-- no leaking or spilling. But we still haven't yet figured out how to make that hot coffee taste good yet. 'Guess we're just spoiled from using a Bodum stovetop vacuum pot. The search for perfect and convienient coffee continues.
1,Great for cold coffee,"Decided to give this a try after many reviews. Coffee is way too cold for me. Already on it's way back. My old cuisinart was not hot enough and this is worse. Guess I will ahve to give the Technivorm a try, I ws really hoping nto to have to spend the bucks. But I like really hot coffee!"
4,Very good for the Price,"I've had this a couple of weeks now and I'm pleased I bought it. It has a small footprint and makes good coffee. My only complaint would be that I was hoping (from the reviews I'd read) that the coffee would be hotter that it is. It's really no hotter than any other coffee maker I've had. And I like my coffee hot! That said, I'd recommend it."
5,The second of a brillant set!,"Once again, I am here to tell you about another extrordinary tape1. A Noun is a Person, Place or Thing2. Verb: That's What's Happening3. Lolly Lolly Lolly Get your Adverbs Here4. Rufus Xaiver Sarsaparilla5. Unpack your Adjectives6. Conjunction Junction7. Interjections!"
4,pretty good stuff,Overall this cleanser does a good job on my combination skin. It leaves it feeling clean and soft at the same time. I also like the fact that it comes in a pump. Very easy to dispense.
1,Not representative of the Cetaphil line...,"Of all the Cetaphil products I've used to date, this is by far the worst.The consistency is too sticky and the smell--this appears to be one of their only products with a fragrance--is, for me, unbearable.Sadly, when I ran out of the ""Gentle Skin Cleanser"" this was all that was available. I was spoiled by the good stuff.After several attempts to use it, I threw away the mostly full bottle.I cannot highly recommend the above-mentioned cleanser but as for this one, please avoid."
2,"Awesome Phone, But Sprint is INTOLERABLE","Treo can do anything. Anything, period. There's nothing that I can't get, as long as I'm willing to pay through the nose to get it.Live TV, (Daily Show, et al.) Sirius Music, email, youtube, whatever you can imagine.BUT SPRINT IS TERRIBLETrue, they offer the Live TV and Sirius which I couldn't live without now that I'm spoiled.But do not call Sprint and expect to be sane afterwards. I can understand busy times and what not, but for the last couple months it seems as though they have cut their workforce in half and doing business with them is intolerable.INTOLERABLE"
3,The wrong size is shown,The picture and description is for the STANDARD size. But what is mailed out is the SMALL size. The picture and description must be synchronized.
5,A pee in your pants read.,"Whether you're a Beavis and Butthead fan or not, you'll agree---these guys know how to make you laugh! Try it (and buy one or more for your friends). You won't be disappointed."
5,this is the bomb that blew the ska world open!,"you have no idea how good this is. If you be down, with a face so long it takes an hour to shave, this will bring you right up. its that good."
1,Third Rate,"This is a copy of the e-mail I sent to the manufacture (pjkids) of the toy box.I am writing this e-mail to congratulate you on building a true third rate toy box. From the ""easy to follow directions"" (three quarters of the way assembled from the first picture), to the panels not being labeled by the letter code to correspond with the ""easy to follow directions"", or the fact that holes needing to be re-drilled so the hinges would fit properly, and also screws showing through the top because the back rest supports would not line up properly. I would also like to mention the great help from your 800 number, oh sorry it is disconnected so they were of no help, or maybe your web site might provide information, struck out again (except 2 e-mail addresses).I am truly dissatisfied with the quality of this product, and feel it is unsafe for my daughter to use, and at seventy dollars I feel ripped off as well."
2,Cures not realistic if you are not the 'mail-order' person,"While this book offers analysis on health problems that are wide-ranging, I have found it to be unhelpful. The book explains health concerns and problems but offers cures that are mostly possible if you live next door to a Chinese drug store, or if you mail-order from its sources stated at the back of the book. Author will give you an answer to your health problems in its explaination with a bolded name of the Chinese herb or product hat you can buy from the source of suppliers in the book. It gives me the feeling that this whole book is a thick advertising poster. In general, I am disappointed. I would give this book away to anyone who wants it."
4,Leather seat mold..,"""I found mold growing on my leather seats in a Vintage Bimmer so I used the old household stuff and the mold came back. So far with the 3m its working and I don't see any mold or stains anywear. Left a flat surface on the black leather so be it. I live in a horribly humid climate so lets see as time passes how this product does. I figured buying a marine base would be stronger."
3,Old card/new card confusion,"I ordered an original ""green"" stackable card (has worked fine for ~3 years) as portrayed in the advertising link (http://www.amazon.com/Q-See-QSPDVR04-Channel-Digital-Recorder/dp/B00069ECUY/ref=sr_1_26?ie=UTF8&qid=1340278030&sr=8-26&keywords=dvr+pci+card)as a simple incremental addition to an existing system. I received the ""blue"" card which is not compatible with the ""green"" card due to different compression technology. The order processing was Amazon.com fine as always. A+ security filled the order promptly. The problem is the emphasis of the ""green"" card in the posting with a minor reference that the ""blue"" card is not compatible. At my cost, I am returning the ""blue"" card to A+ which suggested that I purchase an 8-channel card (requiring additional hardware modifications to the existing PC-based system). Since I did not open the packaging and test the card, I cannot rate it but have to to complete the form, so 3 stars for order processing."
3,Does what's advertised.,"Used as a nanny cam. Instructions sucked, which is unfortunate, because it had a lot of neat features. Play around with it and you'll get the hang of it. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the instructions, and I'm also having problems getting color to work well..."
4,interesting take on pre WWI Germany,"The Chapter on Germany deals mainly with arts and humanities, mainly through a focus on Richard Strauss. But if you really think about the context Tuchman supplies, you can see something interesting.In school, the standard view of history was that the rise of German fanaticism and Nazism owes much to the conditions that flowed from the exceptionally harsh peace terms the WWI victors imposed. Tuchman's portrait leads me to wonder about that. A lot of her material raises an inference that the attitudes and trends that led to the fanaticism were already well in place in the late 19th century and even that had there been no WWI, Germany was headed for extremism anyway, although the details might not have precisely matched what we wound up seeing. An especially interesting chapter in a generally interesting book."
1,kindle edition footnote accessibility,"Just a word specifically about the kindle edition of this book (the single star rating has nothing to do with the quality of Ms. Tuchman's text).As footnote numbers or pagination do not appear here, it is difficult to find the source of a reference. Yes, as in the print edition, notes do appear at the back, but they are very cumbersome to access.For example, I was looking for the source of a Churchill quote cited somewhere in Part VII, at location 7593. True, it does appear in the notes at the back of the e-book, however it was very difficult to find.It would be nice to have footnotes appear in the text, and have them be 'clickable', so that one could view the source easily while reading. Perhaps some e-books have this feature, but not this one does not.I like my kindle a lot, but as I frequently run into these sorts of problems, until they are remedied, I will confine my e-book purchases to fiction where access to notes etc. is not an issue."
1,Poor Tuchman,"In this book, Tuchman gets carried away by her own style, which here is gaudy, prolix, and almost suffocating to content. In short, meretricious. This volume reads less like a book than a sketch book full of charged portraits and superficially treated events.The poster above who detects a ""conservative bias"" in this book is a dogmatist. If anything, the bias tilts leftwards, not radically but discernibly."
4,Love the workouts!,"I love these strength training workouts. I must admit that I have only done the 1st phase. The diet really works, if you work it. I lost 8lbs in 10 days. I then went back to old ways and gained back about 3lbs. Anyway, I'm starting again and hope to get great results. BTW, I can't believe that Amazon is selling it for almost $140.00. I paid $67. plus S&H and tax!"
2,I'm giving the album two stars out of kindness.,"It has exactly one good(ish) song. The Bumble Bee Tuna Song absolutely has its moments, especially at the end. But this album has too much rap, not enough ska. Speaking awkwardly isn't skatological. Have more faith in your instruments, or put them down and pick up a mic, it's open mic night, you mediocre piece of shite.See? Didn't that last line suck? Exactly."
5,Bumble Bee Tuna,"All I have to say is, yum yum bumble bee bumble bee tuna I love bumble bee bumble bee tuna yum yum bumble bee bumble bee tuna love a sandwich made with bumble bee. I love this song great to sing with half drunken friends haha especially 'the girls now' part. Haha great fun get it."
1,waste,"i bought this product expecting a better nights sleep and what i got was nothing. i still have trouble falling asleep and it did nothing for antiety either. id say do not buy this product, it doesnt work, smells bad, hard to swallow, and pretty expensive. save your money people"
1,Inaffective,These suplements do not work i took 1 at first and it didn't work the next a took 3 and it still didn't work
1,"Generic ""no name"" hose","This review has nothing to do with this item's quality. After receiving this soaker hose from Rittenhouse I wanted to return it. There are absolutely no markings or labels with the package that would indicated that this is nothing but a bulk produced, cheap hose. I was expecting the soaker hose shown in this ad's image: ""Lawson Osmile Professional Soaker Hose"". Only time will tell if this hose holds up any better than others I have tried. As it sits right now it's still coiled up and strapped as I have intentions of trying to return it to Rittenhouse."
1,Cinemax version is better,For those wanted to watch this movie because you think it is going to be like the Cinemax version. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I bought this DVD with that thought in mind and when I played it I was strongly disappointed. The scenes were shorter than the Cinemax version. You are better of taping the orginal movie on your own. Once again save your money do not buy this item.
4,Back in 1990,"Coping with sudden change is the subject of the Palestinian-Israeli writer, Anton Shammas, in his beautiful, labyrinthine debut, Arabesques, translated from the Hebrew by Vivian Eden. He begins with Sub-Marquezian tales, sometimes veering close to the exotic, that describe the little Arab village of Fassuta, one that chose not to resist the Zionist annexation of 1948. In describing different generations of his family, he moves between time and place at high speed, interweaving history and autobiography through chains of subordinate clauses, but still achieving clarity. The book becomes progressively more complicated as the focus turns to Paris and America, where the narrative line turns precarious. It is an important novel in that Shammas's pointillist Palestinian history is today intertwined with the present world crisis. Its outcome will partly be measured by how we in the West grasp that the plight of the Palestinians is our plight too."
1,poor delivery service,"I can't rate it, I am still waiting for delivery, your one to two weeks isn't true. I ordered this item 18 days ago, and you still have not shipped."
4,A must read!,"In Oliver's (age 5 from England) words... ""This book is cozy.""His mother asked, ""What do you mean by that, Oliver?""Oliver replies, ""Well because it's cold and snowy for the Gruffaloe's child. I like to tuck into you or Daddy whilst it's read and then I don't feel the cold from the book. It's quite a scary story too because I think the Big Bad Mouse will suddenly appear but really he's only a teeny, tiny mouse that the moon makes big.""It's fun because all the pages rhyme. The best bit goes Aha! Oho! trails in the snow and when you hear this, you know something will get found but it's not always the Big Bad Mouse. I like the Owl best because he's got big eyes peeping out of the tree trunk.""Armchair Interviews says: Oliver, at age five loves to read. We have learned that if Oliver recommends a book, it's a must read. And The Gruffalo's Child is no exception.From Our Armchair to Yours ..."
1,appalling audiobook,we love the stories of the gruffalo. sadly this audiobook adds nothing to the experience. in fact the reader cant even get julia donaldsons name right
2,Dieses Spiel Ist Sschrecklich!,"Wow. I've played a lot of games for the past twenty years and I've come across some stinkers. Usually a game has no imagination, is boring or buggy.Ubersoldier is all those things. I couldn't believe the lack of effort the creators of this piece of scheisse put in. It could've been interesting with a zombie FPS but there is nothing done here which could pass for entertaining or credible. I've seen crappy Sci-Fi channel flicks with better plots.The most atrocious aspect of this game is the voice acting. There have been kindergarten plays with better acting. It's heinous. Truly, truly, truly the worst I've ever heard.I could go on forever explaining how bad the gameply is, poorly designed levels, limited weaponry, sluggish movement, insipid story, etc.ACHTUNG!! DO NOT BUY or PLAY THIS!"
5,Extremely Well Written,"This book is awesome! I finished it in two days because I could not put it down. In my opinion, book 1 is better than book 2, but of course read both of them! The plot is great. It's good to finally see the Romulans playing an active role in the novel. It's also good to see some non-evil Romulans too! Buy the book, it's great!"
4,Definitely worth the money!,This is a great item. My husband and I haven't had sex without it since we received it. I'm not going to get into detail here... But let's just say that I highly recommend it this product! ;-)
4,Pretty Nice,Very powerful! My only complaint is that it is very easy to turn on and off so if it accidentally bumps against something in your drawer it can turn on without your knowledge. Other than that the vibrator is nice. I'm unsure about the ring but it seems to me that it could be possibly painful to the male if it gets caught on pubic hair or something.
5,Book review,This book is very nice. It was part of a gift to my husband when we found out I was pregnant.
4,Great Daddy-themed book with amazing pictures,"I purchased this book for my husband for Father's Day from our 18 month old daughter. The love reading it together every night! It's short & sweet with amazing photographs that my daughter just loves. Great addition to your library, and a really good idea for a Father's Day gift for a new daddy! :)"
4,Pretty much what I expected,"I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase, the only thing I don't like is that it takes a couple of minutes for each Crepe, so last time we made some it was 8 of us and it took quite some time for the last person to get his first crepe."
5,Excellent crepe maker,My original crepe maker that I had for over 25 years finally gave up the ghost. Wanting to make crepes the easiest way possible I found this one and it's just like my original one. I love it!
3,Poker top,My poker table came fast. It came all nice and packed up.Pros-Alot came with the table for the price.It is the right size for a round table.It came looking brand new no problems with it.Cons-It came is green instead of black.I can see how it could get bent if its on a table that it doesn't fit.The table top is a little uneven on one part but not much you can do if it folds up.
3,Peeling chrome...,"Ordered a pair of these. Upon installation, the chrome on one flaked off. Returned, and will try another, hopefully the quality will be better..."
3,Also dissappointed,"I like one of the previous reviewers was a great supporter of Danica and her accomplishments on the track. However, like he, I was also soured by the ego and general attitude and tone of her personality. Not as enthused about her as I was earlier"
4,Couldnt put it down,I was alittle skeptical at first because Im not a big sci-fi book or movie person but after being pushed by a friend to read this I found myself breezing through it and never putting it down. I cant wait for the next book in the series!
2,Horrible Edited.,"For the purpose the book is written, it is very badly edited.There is too much unnecessary text, and the fact that a lot of the book is in the form of online PDF's doesn't help either."
5,THE Modern Physics Text,"Compared to most other Modern Physics text this one has by far the most information, it is also pleasingly self-contained. True it can be tedious reading at times, but getting through it provides substancial enlightenment. It also has numerous examples and mid-chapter thought provoking questions that help you master the microscopic nature of quantum systems. But truely, this text goes beyond the boundary of a normal Modern Physics text, providing superb understanding of the subject; the authors really know what they are talking about, and there is also a web support page for additional information!"
4,Innovative music,"I heard these guys on Austin City Limits and really enjoyed the music. It is melodic yet quirky and unpredictable. I am in my 40s, so I rarely buy music, maybe 3 times a year. After I heard these guys, I decided to buy the CD and I am glad I did."
3,Clinical case scenarios of OB/Gyn,"This book gives you 53 major cases of Obstetrics and Gynecology as one of the Underground Clinical Vignettes series. Obviously, this book alone is not enough to prepare for USMLE Step 2, but the great thing about this book is that it really focus on the disease and keywords that actually appear in the exam (e.g. vaginitis, OCP, amenorrhea, eclampsia etc). You pick up this book, see any of the scenario and if you cannot guess the diagnosis by reading through the history and findings, or any of the highlighted keywords on the scenario is unfamiliar to you, you need to buy this book. If you can, forget about this series, and work on simulated tests."
5,Sticky Stuff,"Very Good Glue.Some sticky stuff, used on ceramic, metal and wood, it created a very tight bond."
5,This is the best wood glue I have ever seen...,"I worked with my father in a cabinet and millworks shop as a boy and then again as a young adult. I used Elmer's wood glue and similar products all my life. When I heard of this new glue, I was skeptical. Once I began to use and had all my sub-contractors begin to use it as well, both myself and all them became believers. I am now using it to repair outdoor wood furniture and anticipate it will work great on all of that as it has for cabinets and wood furniture, including many antiques inside. I am pleased that is remains unset for about 45 minutes, enabling the parts to be moved during that time and after that time sets. It is washable as long as it is wet and unset, once set it is water resistant/proof. I like its bonding capacity as well. I will order more soon!"
3,Simmons scope,"I bought a Simmons 517702, I couldn't get on paper at all.Bought a SiteLite bore laser & found out I had NO windage adjustment, it was stripped on the inside I guess, I am shipping it back (postage all on me) for repair.If you buy one in person, CHECK THIS FIRST !I have another Simmons that's fine."
5,Perfect for air travel,"This has been my carrier of choice for the past three years.The airline has no problem with it because it fits perfectly under the seat.My cat adores it even with his size (he is quite large)True is a tight fit, but he just gets in and gets ready for a lon comfy nap.We even use it to go around town with him. Visits to family members are a joy. (I wish he were a bit lighter in weight though)The padding on the base is perfect. The pockets are just right for papers and food supplies.Going through airports with this is a breeze.I am buying my second one this year because the other one it a bit worn out by now."
3,"No it wasn't, except for a couple.","There were few poems in here that I actually found romantic. With all the good reviews, I even went back and read it again in case I was just in a bad mood when I read it the first time. But, no, my first impressions was the same.Lee Ann Brown's ""After Sappho"" was the best. That was because it echoed my own experience with my wife of now 35 years ago. I also liked Catherine Wagner's ""Lover"" about going back in time and loving various people in literary history. Most of the others just passed me by.I'm listening to the CD with the love songs as I write this. It's better than the book."
4,Cross country skiing,"Great book. Beautiful color photos, great historical stories that give an enjoyable perspective on XC skiing. The technique and equipment are also reviewed."
4,Useful as a Roti presser,"I enquired few of my friends who bought this item from amazon.all of them using this as a roti presser. For pressing roti's this is best option. If you want to make rotis also with this then it is not a good item to have. I press rotis and move it to the pan and heat it. If you use this machine to heat the rotis, it will be tough to eat them , them become dry.Still this is reducing the pressing job. Also you get big rotis 10'. The dough should be very soft when pressing, otherwise becomes hard.Shipment prompt from amazon."
5,You get out of it what you put into it,I hesitated to write a review as reading the other reviews pretty much sums it up. The unit is well made and reasonably priced. I have yet to make a bad tortilla. You simply need to follow the instructions. I am very happy with this purchase and continue to believe that Amazon is the best place to buy.
4,"Be Patient, It works!!!!!","I recieved my tortilla maker and think it's a great product it beats rolling them out by hand. You have to be patient with it. First, if your going to use their tortilla recipe add one more cup of flour but keep everything else the same. Second, this is how I use the machine. I set my doughball in the center of the maker I take the little handles and push down but not hard I quickly lift up and rotate half a turn then I do it again real fast then I press with the little handles again but don't apply to much pressure. Do it again, then just cook with the maker open.Flipping often. I don't even use the large handle. also the recipe is for 12 tortillas I make 8. It worked real well for me.Just don't expect it to be a miracle worker It sure saves time in the long run."
2,Makes 'em round but brittle,"I bought this last Christmas. I followed the instructions to the letter. I ended up with crackers rather than tortillas. I complained to the company. They told me to send it to them. I did and they sent me a new one. The new one isn't much better. If you try to brown the tortillas, they will be crisp. The secret is not to brown them. Cook them very briefly on each side. Then brown on a separate hot griddle. They are on the thick side. My new machine doesn't press as thin as the old one. The griddle doesn't get hot enough to brown them. If the company would set the temperature higher so they will brown and cook quickly, it would be wonderful. They are nice and round."
1,BAD BUY- Not a chapathi maker,If your like me who is looking for a chapathi maker - then please do not buy this - This can make out hard baked - Craker/ Papad like roti/ chapathi. Wouldnt know much about making tortilla on this though.
2,results not good ..,"Couldn't produce wheat chapati (similar to wheat tortilla).It hardens during the process, if only there was a temperature control on this product, that might have helped.2 stars for - good metal coating & dough becomes really flat."
4,great for puffy chappatis,I have used one like this for a long time.I hated making rotis until this came.The trick is making the dough really really soft and pliable. the rotis puff up almost every time.Rub a little butter on the roti if you are going to eat it a little later and store in a closed container wrapped in a paper towel.They taste best if eaten right away.If stored too long the rotis may turn leathery.
4,Does the work. Makes decent chapatis.,"Is a great product for the price. Does the Chapati / roti in a fairly consistent manner. May not be the best Chapatis you will get out of it, but I would not let best get in the way of better!! I can tell you this much, it certainly speeds up the entire process.. I make 15 chapatis in less than 10 minutes now. Would have given it a 5 star, if it could bake it properly all the way through... it bakes like a tortilla.. and for indian chapatis you need a bit more heat to turn it a little brown... so i transfer it to a heated griddle next and let it turn a bit brown (less than 20 secs)."
2,I've seen worse.,"This will never win any awards, but I didn't hate it either. This may be interesting for those who want to see what happens when a man comes undone or reaches his snapping point. Many of the characters were one-dimensional and limited. There was no reason for the female lead to fall in love after seeing the main character in her strip club once. Even the kinky sex comes out of nowhere and is addressed in a shallow fashion. This is the type of movie I might have enjoyed as a teen before I had access to a certain type of movie, if you know what I mean. Luckily, there is some male nudity here amidst all the female toplessness. This film is really for viewers that have some time to kill."
5,Inside the mind of an intelligent woman regarding dating.,"I found this book to be very revealing into what goes through the mind of an intelligent woman in the dating process. The noting of imcompatibilities, the caution, the confusion, the risk and the consequences of mistakes. This is probably a book for intellectuals, romance at the PhD level."
4,Pleasently suprised!,"I picked this book up at the grocery store on a whim... I actually read it word for word, not like I normally skim-thru. The whole energy between these two men and the woman who loves them both, is extremely appealing. I found the tension and integrity refreshing. Some of the other reviewers are right as far as what would have made this story perfection, but the humanity revealed does not make Marsha's writing less rewrding. I was left with a real sense of how love in relationships has many pitfalls. I felt strengthened by the commen sense that, the men esecially, showed in ""seeing"" what was beneth the surface in the other characters. I was shown the many facets of this whole story. The sex was good too and reflected the relationships in all their merkiness. I was right there behind that curtain with Anne and felt all the same gamut of emotions. As this was only my first Marsha Canham book I'm totally excited about diving into the deep-end and getting them all:)"
5,Drymate Whelping Box Liner Green 48 inch x 50 inch,This product was very helpful during the whelping proccess. I used it as a base to towels & sheets. I found my female liked laying on the whelping mat better than towels & sheets.
4,These OEM bags fit & work fine,You can't get too excited about vacuum bags. These work in our S168 stick vac - they are from Miele. What more can we say... Amazon shipping is convenient and saves us time looking for these - Miele bags aren't in every store...
5,Buddhism,"Excellent overview of many Buddhist concepts from the perfect teacher. Recommended for all intelligent people, Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike. Analyze it and adopt if you see the truth in it."
5,KoRn ROCKS!!!!!!,"I think korn is like the best group ever. its true this isnt for 12 or younger, but they still rule. their freak on a leash video rocks and so do they."
2,PARADISE LOST,"The quality is pitiful. I do not suggest you buy this. Fortunately, I got this volume free from a friend.May I suggest that you go online and download the original ""Adventures In Paradise"" theme music and burn it to a disk. Then purchase Gardner McKay's ""Journey Without A Map"". While you read the book let the theme music repeat on your CD player. That's what I did and it was nice. It was fun.I loved this series as much as anyone. Maybe that's why I can't stand watching it in the condition it's in.Journey Without A MapWe can't turn time back, but we can reminisce."
2,blury and not great quality,It was worth it to see this TV series again. I wish someone could video enhance it cause this product is quite poor video quality. Sometimes the sound is fuzzy or choppy. Could be this show was on old kinescope wire or something but don't exptect 1080 p.......(joke)
3,New Age thriller with a few... issues,"I'm a little sorry I read it, but I wouldn't have read it if there hadn't been all these glowing reviews. Time for a different slant.I found this an ""okay"" read but not great. Story flow was choppy at times and the ending seemed forced, like there was a page limit that couldn't be exceeded. The character development was sparse, similar to the style in short stories. The premise wasn't set early so the story built up in an unexpected fashion - not a surprise plot twist, but a shift in story direction that jarred a bit."
3,Awsome if you live near Colorado.,"If you live west of the Mississippi, so to speak, this clock would be an awsome thing to have. But I live in Boca Raton, FL and it syncs itself to an AM station in Colorado. It cannot recieve the signal in the room which I'd like to have it. I had to take it onto the poch for it to be able to sync. Basically, without the automatic sync feature it's just a really expensive digital clock."
1,Poor packaging,"First. It's a puzzle figuring out how to open the package (would you believe you actually need a screwdriver to open the package???) and if you do it wrong, as I did, you destroy the item. I've never seen an item packaged like this, and believe me I buy a lot of electronic gadgets. It might be a good idea for them to put instructions on the packaging as to how to open it. Second, the clock looks tacky, would only be appropriate for a room that is not an eye-catching design."
2,Not worth the nail it's hung on,Sorry folks.. this clock just doesn't set itself! It's as simple as that. You will find no support for this product.
3,It works!,"One strange thing about this item is that I emailed SkyScan, the purported maker with a question, but they claimed model ""86709R"" isn't one of there's. The clock itself has a sticker saying it's made in China.I wasn't able to get the auto-clock set to work....but that could be because I'm in a Manhattan high-rise apartment.Nevertheless, when set manually----the clock appears to work fine!"
4,Seems good...but...,buy it at your local W store for much less! Large selection and priced at about half of what I see here!
3,Hoping for one that has a thermometer that works.,I'm a clock and watch freak! I had no trouble with the clock setting itself. It was fast and I am impressed with that as I live in the mountains near Lake Tahoe CA. I assume it to be accurate but really have no way of knowing how accurate it is. It was interesting to read another review that said there were two clocks 30 seconds off from each other? On mine the thermometer does not work. There is no reference in the insructions to setting the thermometer. I am returning it for replacement and hope the new one works correctly. I tried emailing the company but received no reply so I have to go through the small hassle of returning it.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this clock for my business as a quick reference for date time and temp. The temp feature is the only thing that was a constant. the date and time needed constant resetting and could never remain accurate. I suggest spending the few extra dollars to get a better quality product.
5,THE RAT PATROL: THE COMPLETE SERIES,"THIS USED TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES YEARS AGO WHEN IT CAME ON TV ON PRIME TIME. I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER QUALITY CD DISC. THE PROGRAM IS CLEAR. IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS JUST BEEN RECORDED...THANKS FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE. I'VE ONLY SEEN ONE OF THE DISC UP UNTIL NOW, BUT AM LOOKING FORWARD TO VIEWING THE OTHERS..."
4,Excellent value!!!,"I've wanted to get a good quality Chef's Knife for years -- but, my cooking skills don't warrant a $100.00 premium knife. Then I found the Calphalon knife -- and almost bought it. Happily, I found this 2-Knife set for roughly the same price as the Chef's Knife alone. I'm very pleased with them (...so far). I've been using them almost daily for a couple of months -- and they are holding their edge nicely. They are the perfect soulution for my needs -- quality German steel -- assembled in China (...thus the bargain price)."
1,"Can you say ""predictable""?","...None of the characters is likeable and nothing interesting happens. Also, you can see the big tragedy coming from the first mention of sailing lessons. I also did not find anything particularly remarkable in Cunningham's writing style. After reading all the glowing reviews I expected something much more engaging. This is just one more example of the mediocre tastes most Americans have in literature. If you truly love great books, don't waste your time."
1,Read another book this summer.,"Our book club read ""Flesh and Blood"" and found no discussion material in it at all.The characters were left undeveloped and situations left hanging all over the place. Did Constantine ever harvest anything from his childhood garden after carrying all that dirt in his mouth? Did Cassandra have any final parting wisdom before she died? She just disappears from the book.The truth is, at the end of the book I found myself wondering what the point was. Was the author trying to say homosexuality is hereditary? That theme was the only consistent one in the novel. There was, of course, the brutal physical and subtle sexual abuse themes, the self- and other-destruction theme, the Mom finds herself (sort of) at 50 theme.Read ""Stones from the River"" by Ursula Hegi instead. You will find realistic and well-developed characters, universal themes of love, hate, ignorance, and redemption, and a well-written and highly discussible book"
2,Disappointed on many levels,"While I enjoy a good story of family dysfunction as much as the next person, I was very disappointed in this book, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. The writing was indeed good and the author did not indulge in self-pity or over analyzing. However, I did not find any of the characters the least bit sympathetic and I found the animal abuse throughout the narrative to be a bit hard to take. My experience was further diminished by the fact that I read the Kindle edition which was full of formatting problems and typos. I really can't recommend this book."
4,i want thriller,"Argh! Where is Thriller?? Thriller is absolutely an EXTREMELY important song in this movie. Good grief. Nevertheless, I still recommend this soundtrack if you enjoy 80s music. Besides the ghastly lack of Thriller, it is a good compilation of songs."
5,my fave movie,"this is a really good movie. and the soundtrack is awesome! I was a preschooler in the 80's, so I really don't remember all of the songs on here, but they're great! I really like them. My parents said they remembered them as well."
3,13 going on 30 soundtrack,"This cd didn't have all the songs I thought it would have like Thriller for example. I was disappointed because after watching the movie again I thought it would be a great cd to have, a lot of great old songs, but it left out a few I thought would be sure to be included."
4,Everything but Thriller,"Lots of your '80s favorites! We were disappointed that Thriller was not included. But, we knew that it wasn't before we purchased."
4,13goingon30,Recieved the product in excellent condition.Gave the CD as a gift to my significant other.She really enjoyed it.I listened to it when I return from my business trip.Especially liked: the Go-Gos and Soft Cell.Keep up the good work.JF
5,"""Spoken word"" poetry","This book I found to be beautifully written in simple, short poems that touch on deeply-held emotions I think most women and family-oriented people in general can relate to. My daughter reads it to me during our morning commute; often I find my eyes a little damp. Great book!"
5,I did not find this to be edited or overdubbed.,"I recently purchased this boxed set from Turner Classic Movies' online store, and I have found no over-dubbing of the profanity or editing of any sort. Perhaps another edition of this was issued at a later date than the ones other reviewers were complaining about? I'm very pleased with it, and I can at last discard the blurry old VHS tape I recorded off of PBS during the original broadcasts. I would NOT recommend buying any of these very over-priced DVDs via Amazon however. I got mine from TCM for about $64 after tax & shipping. TCM's site does not indicate any shortage of supply, but if you seriously want this for your collection it probably wouldn't do to wait too long, since it apparently has been discontinued by the manufacturer."
1,So disappointed.,"The quality is truly the worst transfer I've ever seen. I at LEAST expected broadcast quality, but this looks like someone played their VHS copy, pointed a digital camcorder at the TV, and then transferred it to DVD. Awful. Some of the scenes even shake! Also, the dubbed swear words are so insulting to mature viewers. This is DEFINITELY not the original, unedited version. My old VHS copies are better and will continue to be viewed until a truly quality version comes out on DVD. If ever..."
2,Amazing series...DVD transfer - not quite so sure of you,"Yes anyone who's reading this review already knows how incredible this series is. An amazing adaptation of one most entertaining series of books I've had the pleasure of reading (and rereading and rereading). HOWEVER, for those you expecting a remastered Tales of the City, lookout. This DVD edition has only been transferred from its grainy PBS original onto DVD. No remastering, no clean up, nothing. Argh! When compared to the other two DVD sets in the series, the quality is very disappointing - especially given the cost of the set. Is it still worth the cost?, hell yeah, but don't say I didn't warn you. Mr. Maupin, I still adore you..."
5,Simply the Best,"Once or twice in a lifetime a movie comes along that makes you feel like a part of it - a movie that, when you watch it again months later, makes you feel as if you've come home to old friends. The outstanding cast completes this wonderful tale of San Francisco in the 70's. Maupin writes one terrific tale after another and twists them all into a neat little bundle that you'll want to see again and again. Bravo to PBS for making this mini-series and bravo to Showtime for making the sequel. Maupin is pure genius - one of those special writers who knows which strings pull at your heart."
2,still hanging in there,I'm a big fan of the series but #15 & #16 disappointed me. This one (#17) seemed to be making a comeback. The war scenario seemed a lot more believable than #16. I agree with the other reviewers that the editing is shoddy when it comes to grammar and such. But like the last two books the story ended abruptly leaving the reader hanging. The USS Jefferson was lying wounded in the middle of a minefield and the second wave of the enemy attack force was on the way and then the book ended without telling us how the battle ended. Some of the important characters in the series didn't take part in the action and ended up as an afterthought at the end.
4,"Great Memory, package is to big","Works great, easy to install. The only problem was that the package was to big and due to the fact that I used a PO box they charge me too much"
5,Good starting point,"I read this when it came out, and it pointed me toward buying and reading several works I probably wouldn't have otherwise. Of course, this work contains fiction and nonfiction, plus movie reviews, and song lyrics. I'm kind of confused why some earlier reviewers are upset. If there are some mistaken captions, so be it. The direction the book steers readers is ultimately what matters. It is a noble effort indeed to try and waken the consciousness of some readers who would otherwise be ignorant of the important works herein, and/or the Vietnam war era. If O'Nan's book helps the reading public to pick up other books on Vietnam, then he has succeeded admirably. The movie reviews are his own with supplementary comments by others. If readers have a problem with the content, direct that ire toward the individual authors, and not the compilator.Buy the book, it's great!"
4,A wide-ranging collection of classic excerpts.,"Stewart O'Nan has managed to fashion a thematic collection of excerpts from many of the most significant literature to come out of the Vietnam War. These excerpts encourage a new generation to reasssess the war in the context of the nation's identity. O'Nan frames the excerpts within a chronology of when the works were first published. Also, O'Nan includes wonderful essays on the films that created our images of Vietnam. O'Nan's collection seems designed as a core textbook for any teacher who wants students to understand that the Vietnam War lives on in some of the best American writing. One drawback: only a few selections or perspectives from women writers or participants."
4,Great for Great Danes!,"We bought two of these for our Danes since they're so sensitive to the cold...even if we are in texas. It was about the only sweater I could find that looked like it would fit a Great Dane and was decently priced.Both our Danes love the sweater and have no complaints about wearing it. I love the drawstring it has, as they have huge chests and not so huge mid-sections.The only thing I didn't like about them is that they are a little light weight. Looking at the title, it is made out of the thermal material, but I did expect them to be a little thicker.That being said, they serve their purpose and the Danes seem happy. I'll buy them again."
3,"Interesting book, though some factural errors.","Mr. Delmas predicts where the international system is headed based on his analysis of states' behaviors in the past. I'm not sure if he's arguing eroding sovereignty or attempts to maintain sovereignty are a major cause of conflict. Perhaps both? There is one definite factural error. Mr. Delmas says that the U.S. warship Liberty, attacked by the Israelis during the 1967 War, was sank with all hands. This is not true. The ship was attacked with dozens of men killed, but the ship steamed to a safe port. If interested, see Lt. Ennes' books, Assault on the Liberty. That said, Mr. Delmas' is a short book. Worth a read for a French perspective. If you only have time for one book though, consider Daniel Moynihan's Pandemonium. Similar subject, but with I think, a better analysis."
3,Possibly a Good Start,"Unfortunately I found quotes repeated in this book, some of the quotes seemed forced into a category, and many individuals e.g. Peace Pilgrim, were given preferential treatment due to the author's bias. Given the amount of quote resources available on the internet I am not that enthused about the purchase of this book, but I will maintain an average rating because the book did open the door for me to do additional research and find many authors I had not known before."
3,Easy To Use,"This extender section to the Ultimate Pole System is easily installed. Beware though that the taller you make the pole, the more unsteady it becomes. This might be made better by being able to fasten the sections in more securely. I only needed to ad one section to make this tall enough to keep the cats from getting the birds, but that one section compromised the pole and made it lean."
3,Good Knife for a Boy Scout or a Petite Woman,"The quality of the Knife is great. Just like the big ka-bar knife. But for a guy this knife is a joke. I was expecting standard kar-bar fighting knife but with shorter blade. But the knife is an overall miniature version of Full Size Ka-bar. The blade is narrow the handle is tiny and the blade is short 5 1/4 inches (the length was expected). The handle does not fit in my wrist (too short). However it should be fine for someone with small hands ( female, or a kid)Also not good overall camping knife. Not big enough for digging or chopping sticks, horrible for cooking (the blade is too thick for cutting food)The only recommended use is for self defense (if you are a properly trained petite female)quality is 5-stars - usability and handling is 1-star"
3,Home production DVD,"Mine came with a Xerox copy for the cover and a DVD that was burned using a PC! But for people who need beginner info on greenhouses, than this DVD isn't that bad.The program has a narrator talking about greenhouse basics such as how big a greenhouse tom install, were to put different plants,ventalation and heating, and kinds of plants that do well in a cool greenhouse. If you have been already gardening for three years or more, than this DVD is meaningless."
3,Good for it's money but not worth spending it.,"The phone itself works rather well especially with the answering machine built in to the base. 5.8ghz also is the bomb diggity. The phone is inexpensive and does work great, but...It works great, as long as you're within a close proximity to the base. If you're not you can move the handset and hear static. That means your phone signal is still an analogue signal over 5.8ghz. The next part is, if you get close to the fringe of the base, your audio to the base will cut out though you can still hear the other person. Then, the call just stops. It's like somebody hung up but the handset terminates the call.Good for a small place, but for $20 don't get your hopes up. You get what you pay for. My recommendation is to just save up and buy a Panasonic Gigarange phone, never had a problem with my sets of those bad boys."
2,"Of Uniden cordless phones I have bought, this one is the worst by far",Good answering machineGood appearanceBig handsetToo much static just a few feet away from base (I bought two of these)
2,Strange Phone,"Everything went well with this phone for the first day or two, then it started to Answer itself for no good reason! Even with the Answering System turned off. From time to time during the day, it would beep, and I'd hear the message start to play, but before it would finish another beep would happen, and the ""Hello..."" message would start to play all over again. sometimes doing this as may as 10-15 times in a row. I am convinved this phone has a mind of it owns. This Damn thing behaves so badly that it makes you wonder if it's possesed by Deamons or Ghosts.Oh Yeah, it's Loud as HELL.. great if you need to hear it from far away. Nice thing to hear answering itself over and over again at 3 am for no good reason.Think we got the Stephen King Model or something here..."
2,contaminated with new age stuff,"I have to thank ROMC, because thank to her book I learned to speed-read. because I really wanted te get over with Cosmic Journeys. She published the book after Monroe died. My sensation is that she spent time with him a while ago, then she read new age stuff and wrote a book with 1% of her actual experience and 99% opinions and interpretations. If you read Far Journeys, and are looking for a book of equal or better quality of info, DON'T. I would put this book at the same level as Saint Germain stuff, Richard Bach, etc. It reminds me an occasion when I went to a talk that C Castaneda gave in LA, and he said"" when people talk about spirituality, they are saying one thing:MEEEEEEEE""Pre-chewed mambo and jumbo."
2,Griddle slopes to the middle,"The size of this griddle is great to feed my boys quickly before school, I can cook all the pancakes in one shot. The problem is that my griddle slopes to the middle so the batter runs together turning 6 pancakes into 2. I've tried spacing them further apart and that doesn't work. I'm going to return this item for that reason even though, in concept, this is just what I needed, it's very frustrating."
3,"Good cooking area, uneven heat.","Grill leaves lines across the pancakes, and doesn't seem to disperse the heat as evenly as I would hope. It is nice for larger cooking area, and immersible grill."
4,Presto Tilt 'n Drain,Ordered this to replace an aging griddle I had that just wouldnt heat up. The Presto heats up nicely and stays nice and hot. My only complaint is that the temperature is a not entirely even. Loading up the Griddle with 6 pancakes (yes you read that correctly 6!) will leave some of them blonde on top and nice and browned on the other half. Due to the way the heating element is placed on the griddle you do get some cool spots on it while I havent experienced it leaving food raw it does affect color and well we eat with our eyes first. Over all pretty happy with it nothing that a mid cook flip couldnt solve.
2,"Nice size, but....","I bought this for the size and it is perfect for my family. However, it does not cook evenly. The heating coil runs around the edge so the center doesn't cook as well as the edges. I have to rotate my food quite a bit. It would be perfect if the heating coil coverd the whole pan."
4,Good pancakes but difficult to wash,"Admittedly, I have only used this griddle once so far. I was pleased with the cooking process and everyone was happy with the pancakes. (This replaced a griddle I loved but gave to my son.) But it is too large to be able to wash easily. I have a double sink where one side is larger than the other and deeper. But it was still a challenge to wash and rinse this griddle without soaking myself and the rest of the kitchen."
4,BIG Grill,Great grill for cooking for the whole family. You can grill a whole pound of bacon at once. Plus I cooked 12 slices of French toast at on time. It is what I have been waiting for. I wish the cord were a little longer.
1,This just doesn't work,"Despite what all the others are saying, I was hoping to have a nice big griddle that I could use all the time but this just isn't it. I've gone back to my two smaller griddles because this unit just doesn't heat evenly. Yeah, you can cook lots of pancakes, but you have to keep track of them and keep checking on them because the ones on the edges are going to get done faster than those in the middle. And cooking bacon is a joke. Some were burned after a few minutes while others will actually still cold to the touch.I've included a couple images in the customer photos of how the heating element runs underneath. I can't take a photo to show the thickness, or rather how thin the cooking surface is but it feels about 1/2 as thick as my $20 smaller griddles. Basically, it's very thin. All I have to say is 'buyer beware' and 'you get what you pay for'.Cheers."
2,SIZE DOESN'T MATTER,"Yes it was big. But if it doesn't keep it's temperature, i can't cook with it. I've tried pre heating it for 15 min at 400 degrees. Waited for the pilot lite to turn off and dropped an egg on it. one egg. and no it did not drop and sizzle. if i can't cook 1 egg on it efficiently, why would i even need the huge space??on a brighter note, it is very non stick."
4,A must for true Skynyrd fans!,"This DVD is truely a must for real Skynyrd Fans. Although someof the footage and sound isn't of the best quality, overall it'sgreat! It lets the fans relive some of the magic that they made."
3,satisfied,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000UNTN0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis multibin organizer does what its supposed to do. I would have been more pleased had the openings been a little larger as it looked on the web page, but it does hold all the shoes from my family!They are very nice and a good asset to my home."
1,You're OUT of Your Mind !!!!!,"I think you must have a "" brick loose "" if you think someone is stupid enough to pay the price you are asking for this book. What's so special about the "" 1996 Taste of Home Annual Recipes "" ? Are the pages made from pure linen and printed with gold ink ? If you do sell this at the price you are aking, I want to meet the person that buys it. I have some ocean front property in Arizona going really cheap. You are such a jerk :("
2,Review of Book,"I purchased this book as new, and it came clearly used. It even had another person's bookmark in it. The edges were roughed up and the cover was old looking."
5,Awesome,"I don't like fry at home because I am very sensitive in smell. This little thing is a good news. It is not hot outside when frying. I really like this fryer, it does the job and is easy to clean. Also, I like the fact that it's not too heavy. It is very safe than cooking pot. But, it uses a lot of oil."
4,Better than expected,"I bought this fryer before a Saturday College Football bonanza at my house. If you're doing wings, you may as well do them right after all. The price on this was so good, I decided to give it a go. The only (and I mean ONLY) downside is that it may be a bit small on the amount to fry at once when you want to cook wings for a crowd, but for the price I'll deal with it. There was no spillage, the basket holds itself up out of the oil for draining or to reload, it fries evenly, has a lid that you can view through, and gets to temp really quickly. It was very easy to clean as the oil compartment comes out. The best part of all...I knocked it a bit at one point and was fully expecting it to be hot, especially after the 8th batch of wings. It was not. I was able to touch all around it without feeling hot spots anywhere on the outside. When they say Cool Daddy, they mean it. Great fryer! Helped make some great wings, too!"
1,Cool Daddy leaves me COLD,"Right out of the box, the Presto Cool Daddy failed to heat up the oil sufficiently to properly fry potatoes. I checked the oil temp on the max setting with a candy thermometer and a deep fry probe. Both agreed that instead of the 375 degrees called for, the hottest the oil would heat was 320 degrees F. Additionally, the spring on the lid is taut enough that, even with the weight of an oil load in the tank, if you don't guard the lid from springing open, it will splash (hot enough) oil to cause a real hazard. This unit went straight back to the store. I replaced it with an Oster ( Oster CKSTDFZM70 4-Liter Cool Touch Deep Fryer, Black and Stainless Steel ) that does a crackerjack job. If anyone knows how to rate a product with no stars, let me know."
3,fryer,not as easy as i thought it would be. It's good is ur just fryer a few pieces of fish or a plate of french fries but if ur cooking for company it takes too long. I not any burned my hand by the lid coming off while cooking but I also had to get a friend to do some of the fryer the old fashioned way in a deep pan.
5,Compact Work Station,"My earlier model went with my son. This new one seems to work smoother to me. I don't fry anything but chicken, but for this it is fantastic. I'm affraid my other son has his eyes on this one. I guess I'll be buying another one. As the boys say, ""Amazon Rocks""."
5,PRESTO COOL DADDY DEEP FRYER,"I am thrilled with my Presto Cool Dadddy Deep Fryer. At 82 years of age, I have had other electric deep fryers, but non could compare with my new Presto fryer. It is beautiful in appearance, it keeps the heated oil at the proper temperature at all times, the basket holds a good portion of food being prepared. It also has a innerpot that is filled with the oil while frying. When the fryer is off and the oil has cooled, it is then so easy to lift that pot out of the fryer, strain the oil and place the oil back in it's original bottle. And, it doesn't use much oil. I LOVE IT!"
1,Presto,"This is the worst deep fryer I have ever had!!! It barely heats up and by the time I put the food it just soaks in all the oil before itc cooks. Gross!!!! I bought it because it was a good size and nice looking, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,deep fryer,This fryer works well except the handle is hard to get to latch in the out of oil position. It wants to fall into the oil.This was bought for a present and was well recived.
4,Great replacement,We wanted a deep fryer that would replace our 18 year old Fry Daddy. We found the cool-daddy a great replacement and a great improvement. It does a good job on french fries and that is all we have used it for at this time.
5,COOL FRYER,"PURCHASED THIS PRESTO COOLDADDY FRYER TO REPLACE MY FIVE YEAR OLD ONE THAT STOP WORKING.THE OLD ONE WAS TWICE THE SIZE OF THIS PRESTO UNIT,ALSO USED TWICE THE OIL.I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS UNIT.I HAVE USED IT TO MAKE CHICKEN, SHRIMP, PLANTAINS AND AN ASSORTMENT OF BREADED VEGGIES.WE FRY AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK SO I AM HOPING WE CAN GET A LEAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS OF SERVICE FROM THIS UNIT. [...]"
4,Great!,"My boyfriend and I have used this probably 10 times since we got it a month ago. It makes great food. The size is a bit deceiving and takes almost an entire bottle of oil to fill it, which is something to think about if you're going to be cooking with it often."
1,Buy this fryer if You want 1st Degree Burns or a Heart Attack,"Do not be fooled by the safety features presented in this device:1. The oil has a tendency to OVERFLOW, I filled the oil to just below MAX position, and inserted water-free, room temperature french fries into the fryer (slowly) and 300 Degrees of oil poured out of the closed lid even through the charcoal filter (about half the oil the fryer flew out)2. The window is useless since You cannot see anything due to vapors3. Since the window is useless You have to open the lid to look at the food, guess what I am very careful when opening the top because if You just hit the open button, the lid flies back with enough force to rock the entire frier back and forth (certainly not enough to tip it over but still it can if there are some other external factors)4. The food is covered in oil when it comes out (indicator of poor oil temperature)It is a terrible fryer keep away."
5,Doe's everything I need it to do,"I received the CoolDaddy a few days ago and put it right to the test. Buffalo chicken, french fries, fried zucchini all came out great. I am not a chef, but I consider myself a very good to great home cook. In the negative reviews I read it was pointed out that the fryer doesn't heat the oil enough. It does take about 10 minutes to get to the ideal temp. To me that is not a big deal. Turn it on to the desired temp, then do your prep work and within no time it's ready. Seems like the people complaining about the temp are the same one's that put there food in cold pans then turn on the stove. To me this opens up a whole new menu to cook at home"
5,Great inexpensive fryer.,"Overall this is a great fryer for the price and for frying small to medium amounts of food. If you have a larger family it's probably too small, but perfect for a couple. Works really well and easy to use."
3,Need more oil than conventional pan,"Good quality for the price. However, the amount of oil required for a frying is almost double than compare to a normal frying pan. This is because the GAP between the bottom of the fryer and frying net, which is not adjustable and a bit too much."
4,The ChubbChubbs are here!,I am so excited that The ChubbChubbs are available on DVD.I felt that the ChubbChubbs were way better than Men In Black II. This has to be one of the cleverest animated shorts ever.It certainly deserved the Oscar it won.
1,I don't see the point,I don't think this very short film is worth [$$] when it is already on the MIB movie. I bought this for my daughter thinking there was an actual movie to watch with these characters in it. We were both very disappointed.
4,Good-Not Sachar's Best,"""The Boy Who Lost His Face"" was one good book. There was some profanity but it did go along with the story. I didn't bother me. David Bollinger steals an old lady's cane with his ""friends"". The old lady sets a curse on him. He becomes distant with those friends and then he meets Larry and Mo. They become and help David figure out what he did. He meets a girl and she becomes his girlfriend. I won't tell you more becuase I want you to read the story."
3,"Beware, Louis Sacher has a bit of a potty mouth","My 9-year-old son was roaring with laughter as I read this book aloud to him at bedtime. There's a lot of truly funny moments. But beware, there's quite a few curse words. I blurted out (ryhmes with pass)hole before I could catch myself. I'm not completely opposed to strong language in kids' books, but I'd like to know it's there."
1,Inappropriate,"My ten year old son was assigned this book for book club at school. After reading this book, he was accused of sexual harassment for repeating things he read. I do not believe that children should be reading this book AT ALL. I'm very disappointed with this book and the language. Topics include, ""smoking cigarettes"", ""flipping off"", swear words, ""naked girls and boys"", and ""pictures of the naked girls""."
1,Graphic language - Not for elementary students!,"Totally inappropriate! Not only is the language graphic and repeated often, the scene where the boys are ogling pictures of naked 9-yr. old girls is very offensive. I do not recommend that teachers buy this book for their classrooms. Parents if you buy it preview it first before giving it to your child."
3,Great Plot but needs bad words removed,"This is a great story. ButI gave it 3 stars because of the dirty words in the book. It would have been just as funny with the word ""dog poop"" instead of ""dog s**t"" and ""butt head"" instead of ""A**hole"". I think the author needs to revise it on the next printing. If this was a higher level book then I would understand but this is rated a 4.0 AR grade level at and he is only 9 years old. He didn't even know what ""the finger"" or ""the bird"" was and had to come ask me. I ended up reading the book to him so that I could censor it. Also the girl mentioned ""get a period"" and my son was following along and he says ""What's that?"" Luckily, he accepted my answer of ""Something that girls get. I'll explain it later."" We have read all of this author's books and loved every one. This one, however, was a little shocking to see those kind of words on such a low reading level book."
2,Not appropriate for children,"I was so disappointed with this book! I've read books by Louis Sachar before that I really liked. The age range for this book is 9-12, which makes me wonder why the author uses so much profanity. Also, a big part of the book is about flipping people off. In my opinion young boys need encouragement against profanity and crude gestures, not towards it. My 9 year old boy got this book as a gift for Christmas, and he really liked the story. I picked it up to read to him a little from it and found myself leaving sentences and even whole paragraphs out because I found it inappropriate. So, I gave it 2 stars because the story is fun, but no higher since I found it too crude."
2,Why all the Bad Language,Louis Sachar is a great author. This is a good story too. So why was this book ruined with terrible language. The swearing is unbelivable. I wouldnt reccomend this book too highly and parents and teachers- BEWARE. This book was totally bad for Louis Sachar and I hope that no more of his books are so ... innapropriate.
1,Parents BEWARE,"I was so disappointed that a book for junior high must have all those 4-letter words in it. It is simply not necessary to have this. Lot's of kids do and say lots of things, but putting those words in a book is sending such a bad message. I will NEVER by a Louis Sachar book again and would encourage other parents to not purchase such books with this type of language.Why do we have to keep bombarding our children with filth?"
1,Repent,"Peter Wagner might mean well, but he has been hood wink and is leading people with false teachings. Study to show yourself approve before The Lord and get in the WORD and make a commitment to LIVE the WORD and GOD will enlighten you.TODAY WE NEED TO TAKE UP OUR CROSS AND FOLLOW JESUS."
1,No Good Book!,"No good book about filth and corruption it is offensive to everyone, but the pictures are pretty funny."
3,Okay read,"This book was okay and I enjoyed it for what it was - a romance novel set in the West with sort of a prescribed plot. Still, Lowell is one of my favorites."
5,"Great arrangements, wide range of material","This band has been playing since the early 1970s and never fails to please. Excellent vocal harmonies and intrumentation. Something here for almost everyone: beautifully arranged ballads, celtic traditional, acoustic blues, etc. Nice clean recording. Rite of Spring take note - we'd like to hear some more original material on the next CD!"
4,My favorite book in the Magician series by far.,"I found this book ten times more enjoyable and interesting than the former two in the series, perhaps due to the fact that I was bored to death by the entire concept of the Tsurani. Silverthorn has much more emphasis on Midkemia, and I also found the concept of a small group of people braving dangers to find a rare herb much more appealing than an all out war with another world. I was also highly amused by the Gwali, and the battle with the warrior who cut out his own tongue was great fun. For those that shared my disinterest for the Tsurani, I reccomend spending the effort it takes to read through Magician: Master. It will seem worth the trouble when you read Silverthorn, and its follow-up, A Darkness at Sethanon."
3,Set up for bigger things,"This was a fine read. I enjoyed it. After it was over and I started on the next book in the series I realized that not that much happened in the big scheme of things. Its setting up bigger things to come but really the story focuses on a Arutha and Jimmy side quest that I don't think will be important in later books (thats an assumption, I haven't read the other books). Well, if you are anything like me, and liked the first two books you'll buy this one too, enjoy it, go on to the next book and never re-read this one again."
2,Silverthorne,"I hated this book. There was no point to it cept to waste pages and time reading it. This took me the longest to read and actully like. I never got instrested in the book and there no premise to it that made me wanna read more of it. Its about Arutha the new prince of Korndor having to save his princess. To me thats all you need to know. I would really not say to read this book, but skip to A Darkness at Sethanon."
2,A Splendiferous Source of Ironic Quotes....,"Like most politicians, Bill Bennett seems to like himself a bit too much. And as you might expect, the book reads a little like a closing argument in an anti-trust case. But if you are able to ignore the oppressively partisan slant, it does make for a decent read.As I spend spare time exposing televangelists, my favorite quote was: ""the national conversation on values, public morality, and the proper role of religion in public life was hurt 'when those who protest the loudest fail to live up to morality in their own lives'."" [p. 219] And, by the grace of God, he never mentioned Newt Gingrich.... :)"
2,Highly disappointing read,"Mr. Bennett shows a sad, vindictive streak in this book, which I had not expected from him. He acts as if the whole point of politics is to win debates, using whatever vitriol necessary to score points, with no regard for civility or morality. It is nice to see that for all his liberal-bashing in this text, he found better ground in the future, for in his book on virtues he explicitly makes the point that good, moral people can be liberals or conservatives. If you can ignore the rampant hatred, he makes some decent points. The section on drug policy is a great read, much nicer than his assault on teacher unions when he supposedly is writing about education. I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, though it has some positive features. There are more open-minded and insightful political writers out there, like Michael Lind, Richard John Neuhaus or Jim Wallis. Let's not confine ourselves to the angry complaints of a bureacrat like Bennett."
2,Not my taste,"I bought this book based on the reviews but I have to say I am glad I bought it used. Carefully look at the cover, every single project looks the same with that old flowery look. If you like that you might be inspired by this book. If you can get past that you might find this book helpful."
2,A little disappointed,"I am a huge Victoria Holt fan and was so excited to see this book. The reviews on it were great and said it was like reading Victoria Holt again etc. etc. so I couldn't wait to get it. First of all when I got this book and started reading it I noticed that there are many typo's in this book, almost on every page. This was very distracting and I couldn't believe a publisher would even publish a book this way. Second, it was very slow. It was an easy read, but very slow. Third, the ending was really quite exciting and did have a touch of Victoria Holt in it. Overall, this book is not like Victoria Holt all over again. It's basically just an okay read."
3,Green with evil part 1,This video is about the introduction of the most popular ranger Tommy.After a karate competition in angel grove he ties with Jason the red ranger and immediately after kimberly the pink ranger gets a crush on him.When Tommy is on the way home a group of putties attack him along with Rita capturing him and putting a spell on him.He immediately breaks into the command center disables Zordon and gives a virus to Alpha 5.Then he destroys the rangers zords and makes an immediate impact.Ok video.Is a true classic.
1,The life and times of a preppie.,I've read Tolstoy. I've read Dickens. I've read Hemingway. I remember liking them and hating this. Maybe I missed something but there was nothing of interest in the book.
2,CLIFF NOTES NEEDED(atleast for me),ok so this book was very pointless and dumb but i had to read this for my summer reading assignment for 8th grade and you probably could have guessed the I BOUGHT THE CLIFF NOTES The begining started out really SLLOOOWWWWW but after a while it got a little bit better so i recomend to anyone that has to read this as a summer reading assignment you could read the book or as i would recommend get the cliff notes :)
2,"weak hinge, breaks very easily",The clock itself is good but the hinge is the achille's heel on the design. I broke the hinge just flipping the cover too fast. The drag on the hinge snapped off the thin plastic support. Now the clock can't stand.
4,Miss Jump the Jockey,This is a wonderful children's book about a little girl who wishes to grow up and ride race horses. This short story is humorous and teaches the virtues of patience and devotion to a goal. Nice illustrations. Liked it as a kid-keeping it for my kids!
1,Misleading Brand Name,"The colors of the gloves and the description ""..Thorn-proof"" are completely misleading. You get the impression that the gloves are very strong and that they can withstand thorns and protect your skin from injury. On the contrary, these are simple gloves with little protection against thorns and similar sharp objects.They are nonetheless soft and gentle on your hands. If you are looking for strong gloves look elsewhere.They have done an excellent job to mislead the buyer."
3,good idea,I think it always a good idea to have a covered fryer as there is no real way to avoid grease spatter. Unlike my previous fryer this one has readily available replacement filters which should greatly prolong its usefulness in my kitchen. the only downside is it arrives as a do it yourself project requiring assembly I didn't want to do.
2,Not hot enough,"I bought this (from Target) primarily because I have a 12 year old who likes to cook. I like the fact that you can close the top and then lower the basket into the oil and I like that it has a cool outer casing. Thus, my child is less likely to be injured when frying items.That being said, I noticed that everything we made, from french fries to fish to chicken, was mushy and oily despite the fact that I had the dial set to 375. I used a candy thermometer to measure the temperature and new oil, with nothing in it, only registers at 320 degrees. This is not hot enough to make crispy anything.After a lot of research about home fryers (and even commercial grade countertop fryers) I have found that this is true of most (if not all) fryers. If anyone has information on one that reaches 375 degrees, please let me know!Back to the dutch oven on the stove."
3,"Well designed, but anemic heat","This is a well designed product in that it can be loaded with food, the lid closed, then the basket lowered into the hot oil and raised at the end of cooking all without danger of splatter. The exterior does not get as hot as other, similar products and will not burn the skin but does not stay cool as the name may imply.The one problem I have is that many cooking instruction call for 400 degrees or higher cooking temperature and few units, this one included, will not raise the temperature that high."
4,Fully functional at a low price,"I have had this fryer for a month now. It is quite good. Has all the features you would expect in an entry level fryer. You can control temperature and it has a cool touch surface on the outside. The pan it has is aluminium so you don't worry too much about scratches. (Aluminium is not too healthy either though).One thing though, it takes this fryer 12 minutes to heat up."
3,Exactly what I wanted,"This was exactly what I was looking for when searching for fryers. It's pretty big, however the basket is quite shallow. Still, it can fry a decent amount of food at once. I like that I can close it when I put the food it because thats usually when it would pop oil out. I like that it has a temperature gauge, as well. I can cook the food as instructed instead of guessing. Overall, I would definitely recommend it. Just be careful who you order it from because it took almost 2 weeks to get mine!"
1,Doesn't get hot enough,"I wondered how come it was taking my fries so long to cook. So I got out the old trusty candy thermometer and, sure enough, with a setting of 375 the oil wasn't quite 340. And I've barely used this thing. I got it as a gift - I had asked for a deep fryer - and my mom got me this model. It's about 6 years old and VERY lightly used. It might be useful as some other sort of cooker, or for keeping things warm, melting wax on a lower setting maybe. I don't know, but it's not good for deep-frying. It's going on Freecycle."
3,Just purchased,"I just recently purchased this item for my home. I have used it twice already, once to cook fries and another time to fry chicken drum sticks. So far so good, every thing cooks evenly. I had to puchase a deep fryer because my stove cooks at an exceptionally fast rate, therefore the outside would cook faster than the inside. I was very discouraged with frying chicken to the point that I would bake or broil chicken more than anything.Now with my new deep fryer I can once again enjoy fried chicken at least three times a month."
5,Huidobro is the quintesential Latino contemporary poet.,"This epic poem begins with language that is fascinating and strangely honest. It is written in seven cantos which prove to be a very easy read and striking at the same time. Huidobro invites you into a world that is created and governed by himself, much like the world Tolkien created in ""Middle Earth."" The difference is that in Huidobro's world there are no rules, no grammar, and no universal truths. A reader should leave his or her own biases and assumptions at the cover of the book. By the time the poem is in its last canto, the author arrogantly assumes that the reader speaks the language of the poem and writes accordingly. The poem was written for readers who can understand the last canto of the poem, which to the naked eye appears to be nonsense. Huidobro is one of the finest contemporary poets that I have come across."
1,Not recommended for any level!,I agree with the reviewers that were disappointed in the tape as a whole. Her continuous babble through the whole thing is anything BUT relaxing or even instructional. I have taken yoga classes before and really enjoyed them -this was no where near that experience. I don't have another recommendation since this was my first tape but I can definitely save you from wasting your money on this one!
1,"Poser, not poses","This is, hands down, the worst fitness video (let alone yoga video) I have ever come across. Denise's voice is grating and the workout is terrible. If she reminds me one more time of how I should ""feel the wonderful benefits of this movement"" I will die. The workout as a whole is not at all relaxing and I didn't even feel like I was working throughout the entire process. Austin's grasp of form and her ability to convey proper poses is appalling! Avoid this video at all costs!"
2,Not so great.,"This is really not a good video. I thought I would take a chance on it, but now I regret it. Not only is she very annoying, she doesn't hold any moves longer than about 4 seconds. I don't really think you could see results doing this program. And the first thing on the video is her talking about how good the video is... that is a bit strange. I will not be watching this again. There are much better videos out there, pass on this one."
1,Ugh!,"Denise Austin's endless, mind-boggling chatter is so annoying that I usually use the mute button on this one. I've never heard someone so focused on hearing herself talk before and have found the experience to be quite astounding. Also, she breathes through her nose quite loudly and uses some variation of the following phrase during the yoga section at least 10 times - ""feel the power of yoga."" Anyone with a low threshold for bubbly, blonde bimbos should NOT buy this video."
3,Video good for pilates!,I hadn't ever tried yoga until this tape and hated it! I do not like her approach to yoga. I LOVE her pilates half!!! It is excellent! The pilates is really good for me because I cannot put stress on my joints and it stretches and strengthens muscles without all the aches. I would recommend this for the pilates.
1,Doesn't Work After 6 Months of Light Use,"The drive quit working after about 6 months, and I only used it about 3 or 4 times, if that. Also, when it did work, It copied very slowly. Now when I connect it to a PC I get ""Drive will not start"", and it doesn't show up in my computer. It was a great idea, and the 5 gigs is nice, but if it doesn't work then what good is it? I am sticking with flash memory drives after this experience."
4,cute.. but a little bulky,"I bought this product about a month ago. It took a few extra seconds than other USB drives to get detected, but works flawless.In a laptop like mine, where the usb ports are placed adjacent to each other, the extendable usb cable allows me to use other usb devices at the same time.I expected the drive to be a little smaller though. Nonetheless, it fits into ones pocket. The password protected partition is a very useful feature to store sensitive data. Overall, this is a very good product for people who need large storage in a pocket device."
5,"Excellent device, lightweight...","I have only had the seagate for a short period of time but have used it quite frequently. It is bigger than my other pocket drive at 128 mb, but I just throw it in my backpack (I am a college student, Electrical engineering). It works on every computer I've tried and sends data fast. The cord winds up inside the compartment for tangle-free storage. I would highly recommend this if you need a large amount of storage and aren't highky concerned about it being just a bit larger than normal flash drives."
1,Data constantly lost,I purchased this drive after reading through numerous positive comments. I am sad to say I have lost data 3 times now and am extremely gentle with the drive.
1,One Month,I had this for one month before it went out/became unreadable. I went to the seagate site to do a warrenty claim and it reported it was out of warrenty.....no matter how cheap it may be one month use is not worth it.
2,Terrible for printing CDs and DVDs,"THE INK SMUDGES, even after letting it dry for 2 days!! Totally useless feature of the printer. We bought the printer and a huge stack of printable CDs and DVDs and now it's all garbage.It seems to me that this whole ""Inkket printable CD/DVD"" thing is a big scam. Not only does the ink smudge, but it also chips off really easily."
5,Great workhorse for garden-variety family/student printing,"I've had this printer for about a year and a half now, and it works great. My wife used it quite a bit as she was working on her master's in English. Seems like they grade grad-student papers by the pound.I use it from time to time for photos, and to my untrained eye, they come out just fine when you use quality paper.Epson probably doesn't appreciate this, but we got a continuous ink system for it that cut our ink costs to a small fraction of what we'd pay for regular cartridges.From time to time we do notice gaps in the printing, but the nozzle-cleaning program that comes with it seems to take care of the problem. We run the program 5 or 6 times, then it's back to normal.We've never used the CD printing function.Overall, we love the printer, especially for the price."
1,Epson R200 - Avoid this thing,I bought this for my office for the sole purpose of printing simple CD/DVDs.It was always very awkward to operate. There is this detachable CD/DVD tray which lined up improperly probably 1 out of 5 times. I speak in the past tense because now it does not work at all. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,"Epson R 200, never liked it.","Didn't like it- tray had to be replaced, flukey performance, slow, noisy, quirky. Paired with my macs it never was really dependable. Once one ink ran out I had to replace them all. Would not work on just the black cartridge. I feel like i'm in a alternate universe here, I never really had good luck with this printer- switched to an Epson Artisan 725 all in one for less than the ink for the R200- love it, this is a quiet , well behaved machine. No sliding tray to go in and out , then in again, then print (if you were lucky) like the r 200 did . Nothing but trouble."
1,Complete SCAM!,Warning - This printer comes with ink cartridges that are only about 2% full of ink and the second any one of them runs out the printer WILL NOT PRINT AT ALL. I went and bought a new black and it will not print until you buy ALL of the color cartridges. What a rip-off!
1,Don't ever buy a used printer,"Printers last about 2 years, due to failures with their weakest link, the print heads. Once they clog, you can throw the printer away. If you have spare ink cartridges for the unit, you can throw that away as well, because the replacement unit will require different ink cartridges. If you think you're clever buying the same model printer used, think again. It may be advertised as in ""Very Good"" condition, but when you receive it, it may be just as clogged as the unit you are trying to replace. Then you will be stuck returning it, at your expense. And the person who sold it to you through amazon.com may refuse to refund the cost of shipping to you as well. I wasted over $40.00 in shipping charges (to and from) with nothing to show for it. A real waste of time and money."
3,Dog ate it,This book had more damage than I was informed. The back cover was half-way gone from more than a simple dog bite to the corner.The pages where ok just a littlewater damage still readable. The shipping and handling was on time recieved in a few days. overall it was okay.
4,"Great ladder, great price, easy to store and use","I ready some reviews of this product that said it could hurt your fingers. I have not had any issues. Just take your time taking it down, one section at a time, and it works great. I could not find any ladders of this height that would fold down to 36"" and only weigh 35lbs. I am a roofing estimator and it is small enough to carry around in the trunk of my Jetta. It is very well made and sturdy. Highly suggest buying it!"
5,The most informative resource for lion dancing in print.,Dr. Hu has done a great service to the lion dancing community by compiling this book. He does a great job of documenting many aspects of this ancient Chinese art. It is interesting that it also includes a section on the how the lion dance is practiced in other countries such as Japan and Korea. This book is a definite must-have for anyone interested in the history and practice of lion dancing.
2,A little too fast-paced for pre-schoolers,"I think this video is a little advanced for pre-schoolers. The action is a little too fast and in-your-face. The video contains a few ""safety"" songs, one of which advocates that kids ""stop, look and listen"" before crossing the street...but then the Firefighter video shows Mr. Frumble darting out into the street a few times. In my opinion, the CINAR Richard Scarry videos are not of the same high caliber of the older ones by Random House."
2,misleading product ad,"I bought this because the price was good for two handles (like shown in the picture and stated ""handles"" plural in the title). There is only one. Description does not mention there is only one either. Needless to say, the price is terrible for only one handle. I will not buy from this seller again. Cheaply built product and false ad."
5,"Smart, real & funny!",I love this show because it is about NYC without the rose tinted glasses. I think Sex & the City is way off the mark in making a show about New York. These younger girls are having a more real experience and it is funny to watch!
2,I can't be bothered,"After only one episode of ""Girls"" (the pilot in which Hannah wants to become ay voice of ay generation), I decided that I can't be bothered. I'm completely uninterested in the eventual fates of these boring, pathetic, twenty-something...well, girls. A few really ugly, disgusting boys have been included, too.""Sex and the City"", come back, all is forgiven - I mean, the men in that series were more gorgeous than the womyn. And I'm a straight male, OK?Two stars. There will be worse stuff than this in real life when peak oil hits home. These girls aren't starving...I know, I know. It's a sitcom. Whatever."
1,Who would watch this show?,"I can't believe this is even on the air. Once again Hollywood shows us how to be self-centered, engage in ridiculous sexual situations, and promote permissiveness and unrealistic lifestyles in today's society. Bad stuff. By the way, I have raised 4 daughters and they have never acted like these girls do. Not even close. This show is much like the Emperor's New Clothes story, there is really nothing there but because Hollywood has to embrace anything that is out of the norm, it is getting lots of attention. That really is a bad tendency they seem to have. I think Lena Dunham is very lucky, but this will pass."
5,Really Funny and Smart,"This show is very funny. It doesn't hold back on anything, these girls talk about everything. There are some extremely awkward sex scenes which might bother some people, but it's worth sticking with it. It reminded me of my college/just post college days."
2,Generation Selfish,"Watching the previews for this show and listening to friends talk about it made me think it would be funny. The whole time my husband and I were watching we were irritated about the main character's inability to understand why her parents wouldn't bankroll her anymore. This ideal that 20 somethings have that their parents are supposed to support them until they are making bank is just crazy. Then the scene where she visits with her guy and they have sex on the couch- soooo depressing! Not in a funny way, either. The dialogue for the show is very realistic and almost funny but just not there yet. I know we are always reaching for something different and fresh in our tv viewing but for me this is not it. I'll try watching one more episode but if it doesn't pick up...meh!"
5,Sounds like a great show to watch,The preview of Girls made the show sound very interesting. If I find the time to watch it I'm going to purchase the series.
2,I just don't like it,"I bought this day one as a blind buy. I guess it was an impulse purchase. I just do not like it. I felt the main character was just not likeable. She has sex with the same ugly guy when it is good for him. So he ties her up and does her in the butt. I am not shy to sex on television but I hate this show. Snotty bitches complaining about things they should be grateful for. Get off you crusty lazy ass and quit expecting Mommy and Daddy to support you. Ugh, I wish I had seen before I bought. I felt like I had been butt assaulted after watching this."
2,Girls makes me feel sleezy to be a girl!,"What a rotten example for young women. Are they to feel outcast because they don't have casual sex, sex sex and more sex, butt sex, etc. sex?"
2,"Great game, but you need a patch to fix a performance issue","I played all the previous versions of Sim City back in my bad old Windows days and really enjoy the game. But for some reason this version will paralyze even a fast Mac. I'm running this on an iMac 1.8GHz G5 with 1GB of memory, and after about 10 minutes of play I have to quit and restart the game because the response becomes impossibly slow. Very frustrating. Haven't tried the updater yet, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.UPDATE (Apr 05): Installed the updater and it appears to have fixed the slow response problem."
5,One Great Game,"This game is simply a must have. Yes, at times it does have a slow gameplay, but, for the most part is is smooth running. When you do have bigger cities, in order to keep it running smoothly, you must lower some graphic quality, ex. not have high building variety, low amount of cars, etc. I've played SC4 on my friends' PCs, and yes, it can run slowly too. If you want a fast running Sim City, you are just going to have to live with out the high intensity graphics."
2,Sweet,"I had listened to Ostroushko's Sacred Heart CD, and had read the other positive reviews, so I dared to buy this one, but was completely disappointed. The voice is mediocre, and the texts are much to sweetish. Also the melodies are quite uninspired.In my opinion, Peter Ostroushko should stick to instrumentals, I do like his fiddling and mandolin playing."
1,Poorly written with few redeeming qualities.,"I actually read this book cover to cover, I'm still not sure how. Phillips work reads like one long rambling run-on never getting to a point. The entire book could be summed up by the following: ""Mediation is good, litigation is bad"" and ""Mediators are great."" If you read these statements you can throw the book away. It is a steady repetition of these themes told through less than interesting cases and accounts. This book oversimplifies the subject and has little in the way of concrete, applicable information."
1,VROOM VROOM SOME ONE CALLED THE HIPPE?,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS HE LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING UGLY HIPPE ON WHEELS! THANK YOU AND GOOD DAY
1,The world is far more complex than Harvard.,"The book is largely anecdotal and fails to use evidence beyond the author's own experience or the experiences of friends and acquaintances at Harvard. Dissenting voices are treated as ranting and hyterical; dismissed rather than confronted in a manner that is intellectually honest and sound. Roiphe claims to have universal legitimacy, but there is serious reason to question whether her observations would hold up under close scrutiny even with the narrow confines of Harvard Yard."
4,Works well for what it is intended,HW Prod. UTBB H. W. Ten/Sax Bell brush. Has definitely helped simplify my after practice clean-up routine. Dries-out well too.
2,Save your money,I bought this awhile ago and was very dissapointed. Looked at it maybe once or twice and then sold it at a garage sale.
4,Clearly written but few worked examples,"This text is very well written with clear explanations and succinct abstractions to aid in thinking about the material. The only shortcoming is the lack of worked problems which can be gotten from any other text. If you can't picture the processes of thermo well enough to set up a problem correctly, then give this book a try. I use it along with Baierlein's book and Fermi's Dover version."
3,Good book but no answers => Difficult to use for self-study,"Problem for a reader who is using the book for self study:1. No answers to the exercises! How are you supposed to know if you are on the right track?2. There is an almost complete lack of worked examples in the text. Just theoretical explanations (though very well written).On the positive side:* The author goes to great lengths to give the reader a good intuitive understanding of the concepts presented.* The exercises are very well thought out and if you do them, you will end up with a good understanding of the material.[Edit: I heavily edited this review after reading the book more closely. I am still unhappy that there are few worked examples, and no answers to questions, but otherwise it is a very good book in my opinion.]"
2,Very confusing -- didnt even cover the basics!,"*this review concerns the edition that did not discuss libertarianism.. that would be a welcome addition*I give this two stars because there WERE parts of the book that were factual, interesting, and important. However, I found the entire book as a whole to be sloppy, confusing, and poorly written. For example, throughout the entire book, I was waiting to see a simple definition of socialism, or for a distinct difference between socialism and communism. However, not only does the author never do this, but he confuses the reader more and more by talking for dozens of pages on MARX in the SOCIALIST chapter, when Marx wrote the COMMUNIST manifesto!?! Does he explain the links or relationships between the two? Never. I was surprisingly disappointed in this book, as I would be very interested in a thorough, succinct, clear analysis of these philosophies."
2,Poor Battery,This has excellent voice.The only drawback it that it runs on batteries and they drain in half an hour.Not recommended
5,Good for my chickens!,"We're having a cold spell here in the Northeast US. It hasn't gotten above freezing for a week now and my chickens' water froze. We have a 5 gallon home depot bucket suspended in their coop with chicken nipples at the bottom for them to drink out of. We'd tried an aquarium heater but it wasn't strong enough. This has done the trick so far! Its only been running for the day, but it melted the ice that was on the top. Seems to be doing the trick!"
5,Service first,"Among the many differences between Charlie Trotter and a thousand other gifted chefs, the one that sets his Chicago landmark apart from the crowd is fierce attention to service, as Edmund Lawler points out in this wonderful survey of the Trotter philosophy. Waiters at Charlie Trotter's have no manual, but they strive to follow the Golden Rule - treat customers as you would be treated, not just in general, but in every tiny circumstance. Not only that, but Lawler also points out, Trotter's senior servers enjoy full health care coverage, $2 employee meals and a sense of responsibility. It's so simple, really. Trotter treats his employees as he would be treated. Lawler lays it all out in a readable and succinct fashion, with each chapter backed up by handy ""service points."" Whether you're running a restaurant, an airline, an investment bank or a lemonade stand, you could learn from reading Lessons in Service. Oh, if only more service business managers would!"
5,Fantasitic basic astonomy review!,"Standard Deviants always put out great videos. This one in particular is funny, sometimes a bit cheesy, but always easy to understand. Tape one of the astronomy review looks at the basics of astronomy including Newton's laws, Kepler's law, Wien's law, and a look at the earth and the moon. They also include funny stories about the history and people of astronomy. One particularly fun thing about the tape is that it is aimed at college students, and the humor is more adult then other ""funny"" educational tapes out there."
2,battery life is problematic,"dvd player works well. Battery fails to hold charge after being used 5 times. Toshiba has sent us 2 replacement batteries so far (in less than one year). If I had known about the battery problems in advance, I would not have purchased this product. I would NOT recommend it to others. From reading other on-line reviews, my battery problems seem to be widespread, although Toshiba has been honorable with us so far."
4,Very Good Player,"I just bought my first Portable DVD player and I decided to go with the Toshiba. I'm a big fan of movies I own about 300 of them. I couldn't wait to try out my new toy. I was very impressed with the Quality of sound and love the rubberized case and red is my favorite color. I love the fact that two people can plug into the unit with headphones. It will come in handy when you don't want to disturb anyone. I will be taking mine with me to Las Vegas next week. The unit itself is wonderfully made and so durable that you can do and take it everywhere. I just watched a movie while working out on the treadmill. If your looking for a unit that surpasses all others then I highly reccomend Toshiba. You'll love it!!!! Rebecca from Columbus,Ohio."
1,Nothing but problems. 3rd unit! Just looks nice thats it.,"I'm amazed Toshiba would make such junk. After going through 3 of these I did a search on the net to see what others had to say and I've leared I'm not alone. All 3 units would show ""loading"" when putting in a DVD and thats it. I'm tired of returning mine to the store. While I am impressed with the looks that is all it is, just looks. Third one in a week.Don't take a chance if it does not fail the day you get it home no doubt your turn will come up shortly after."
2,"Okay, not great","I've had this DVD player for about 2 years. We bought specifically to keep my kid occupied on planes. We travel quite a bit so it's seen a lot of the country and I've put it through it's paces. I think the best way to describe this DVD player is adequate. The picture is fine, not specatular. The sound is fine, but again not spectacular. The thing that really irks me is that it's rubber skin gives you the impression that it can hold up to a beating, it can't. Just a little bump and the movie resets. Which makes it impossible to use in a car. I would not reccomend buying one of these unless you enjoy torturing your child by restarting their movies every time your car hits a pothole."
2,Don't Buy Unless You'll be Using Headphones,"Use in any venue with any amount of noise was not possible with the unit I purchased, unless one used headphones. Unit felt cheaper than I would have thought based on visual design. Screen was fine. Returned it....liked my three year old Panasonic with tiny screen better."
3,HISTORY On Blu-Ray,"I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, I admired his work and talent, I still enjoy watching his great music videos, and I hope they will remaster HISTORY, both audio & video, on Blu-Ray !!! I hope it happens."
5,Michael is Awesome,I love everything Michael has done. He is the King Of POP what more can you say.No one will ever walk in those shoes again. Icon and One Of A Kind.
1,WON'T FIT YOUR 2003 MERCEDES E320!!!!,"I ordered this filter a month ago - outside of the return window. Now that I found out where to install it, I can't - It won't fit. If you want it, come and get it. Don't trust the application info Amazon provides. This filter isn't even close to the right size for ANY 2003 mercedes E class car."
5,Long live Paul Simon,great reminder of a wonderful disc of music and what it took to put it together. I give Paul Simon a lot of credit for standing up to the attacks he had to deal with for putting this music out........and to the African artists who worked with him. An excellent statement of collaboration and respect.
5,"WASH, FOLD, AND DIE","I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS SERIES BY DELORES JOHNSON, AND THIS ONE IS ANOTHER GOOD STORY. HER CHARACTERS ALWAYS GET INTO TROUBLE AS DO-GOOD BUSY BODIES, BUT IT FUN TO FIND OUT HOW THEY SURVIVE"
3,boo it stinks,"this book was written by a tenth grader as he goes through the school year the errors in grammar such as no comas, and his lack of period make the book irritating. pretty much the only accurate thing is how much he thinks about women. Overall I found the book okay but nothing special."
2,Inaccurate and Poorly Written,"This book is a poor example of the exaggerations and false generalizations of young America.Being that I just graduated the 10th grade, I admitedly concede that the general population of American teens amounts to not much more than a sex hungry ignorant idiot, the exagerrations put on by the author are far too overbearing.The book takes steps in the wrong direction by assuming the thought process of the author is that of every other person of the age."
1,simply bad,"No reading value what so ever. The author attempted to produce something micmicing ""the catcher in the rye"" but sorry, he painfully failed. What's wrong with this generation? This kind of lousy material got a chance to be published? What a waste of resources."
2,Golly Jeez,"First let me say that this is one of the few (older) trek novels that read like an episode...unfortunately it would have been third season.It isn't so much that it is bad, it isn't. It's the characterization that was the more annoying. At one point Kirk says ""Oh jeez, I need to contact the Enterprise."" Oh jeez? How many times did Kirk say ""oh jeez""?I also had a bit of a problem with the way McCoy is portrayed in command. I won't go into it and potentially ruin it, but suffice it to say I didn't realize his talents (at least according to the novel).So, if you want an ok Trek novel with really annoying characterization and dialogue this one is fine. Again, not bad but I couldn't quite get past what I would classify as the ""Turnabout Intruder"" form of Kirk, and some of the other main characters too."
4,"Alvin ""Bass Binz"" McCoy","This is Magic Mike getting rid of loser MC's like MC Madness and produces what he known for. It shows how good his hand skills are and quad droppin' powers. This shows in ""Feel the Beat"", ""Past and Present Times of a Black Man"". This LP also introduces Magic's lyrical ability instead of just laying down funky cuts. There are fun songs to listen like ""Rhyme after Rhyme"". This a good CD to have if you have good system in your ride."
4,you need to watch a certain movie to GET it,"first watch exorcist 3....i know...not the best movie out there but if you do watch this movie first, you'll realize that a lot of the ""lyrics"" are lines from this movie. Anyone else caught this? Try it....and the music is kinda old techno but still kinda trippy. have had this cd for a very long time already."
5,I miss these boys here,"I remember bumping this staedily back in 91-92 this is the shiznit mike is one of hip hop's most underrated dj's and him and mc madness paved the way for trick daddy, and trina every cut on here has the famous miami booty bass sound."
2,What a disappointment!,"Before buying this book, read the first few pages. If you like the style, then you'll like the book. If not, you'll find that this is a great story that was ruined by an annoying style."
1,Blah.,"This was fairly lousy. My fiance and I have been playing games like this for years, so we have plenty of practice and basis for comparison. The puzzles in Rhem tended to make very little (if any) sense in the context of the game, so they weren't logical. As for the graphics, it looks like someone went bonkers applying the same two or three textures to every possible surface. I think the people who designed this game need to go back and play some good quality games themselves so they can get an idea of what a puzzle game should be like. The end has no interest or closure...just basically, congratulations, you made it through.Blah. Don't waste money on this."
1,Didn't work,"The game told me to use 600 screen resolution, my monitor doesn't even go down that low. I installed the game, and tried playing it. I clicked ""new game"" and I got an error message telling me it could not find ""Intro"" file. Now I know why it was a $9.00 Staples game. Never buy games at Staples on the buget shelf. I'm 0 and 2 there. By the time the games end up there, they're too outdated for any computer built in the last few years. Rhem can't even be played."
5,this cartoon series was the best back in the 90's,This is a must have cause the animation was good for american cartoon's back then the U.S. cartoonist could draw good and make good action cartoons. We need to bring that back. We could be just as good as the japanese anime. The Spider Man series had other marvel characters that made guest appearances on the show even Stan Lee himself made a guest appearance as a cartoon character. Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider then the next day he had super powers he never needed glasses again.
4,"Cool stuff if you like the era, late 80's/early 90's",Good addition to your cd collection as this is not avaialbe as MP3 album at the time I bought it.
4,good as a supplement for JPs.,As a CT JP I'm always looking for ideas to share with wedding couples. I thought this book would help show what options can be inserted into the marriage ceremony.
2,"Alvin ""Bass Binz"" McCoy","This LP only has 6 tracks and only 2 good tracks for those type of people who like it slow and low. It has a remix of ""Ain't No Doubt About It"". and ""Class is in Session"". I am a big fan, however not one of his best works."
3,A resource tool for managing a changing environment,"Over all, ""The Human Side of Change"" is an excellent resource tool in helping managers deal with a changing environment in the workplace. The author does a good job at identifying key issues that will assist you in improving your management/leadership skills. I think that every person in a leadership position, whether it be lower level, middle, or upper management, should take the time to utilize this book. I believe that overall it will improve your job performance, in your own eyes, and in the eyes of your employee's."
1,This series sucks!!!,"This series features the same characters(the HeadMasters) in every episode. Optimus Prime dies early in this series and Rodimus Prime goes away on some space journey leaving a HeadMaster named Cerebros as leader of the Autobots. I got tired of seeing the same Autobots in every freakin' episode. Are there really only five Autobots left to fight the Decepticons? Same thing for the Decepticons too, same ones in every episode. It was ok for a while,but it got old fast. I kept waiting for Rodimus or Optimus to come back but it never happened. Total disappointment."
3,Fun but keep as a model,"was fun for 8 year old to build but it was not sturdy for him to play with after we built and glued together. It fell a part:( would have been great if we left it as a model, or as a puzzle."
5,well deserved tribute to peter green,"This one is almost perfect. From the true to the original ""Oh Well"" to the hauntingly beautiful ""Closing My Eyes"", this one shows what an amazing talent Peter Green was in the early Fleetwood Mac. There is almost nothing not to like on this. The performers range from Kim Simmons, Lonesome Dave, Stu Hamm even Ian Anderson is here. The only down side is that I really love the track by a band called Naked Blue and I can not find any thing else by them, but I keep on looking. Do yourself a favor people and get this cd."
1,Can I give it less than 1 star?,"Bought one of these at the store quickly, as we were looking for a manual one - assuming incorrectly it would last longer than an electric. Worked great for less than one day, though the vacuum mount never worked properly. Can no longer sharpen anything with this, as it won't grab the pencil - regardless of what size I try. Horribly designed, ultra cheap, and not worth it."
2,Won't work with Lenovo 3000 N100,"Even though that laptop's specifications say that it takes the same speed and ""type"" of memory (PC5300 667MHz DDR2 SODIMM) and it fits, it would not recognize this RAM. To their credit, TigerDirect looked it up for me and gave an RA. I wish there was some better way to find out if RAM will work with a computer - if ""PC5300 667MHz DDR2 SODIMM"" isn't close enough, what's the magic ingredient?."
3,Good presentation of other artists' work only,"I was looking for a book that would show other artists' work AND also give me some insight into how they chose the colors they did and a little about how they composed the piece, at least if I want the book to keep in my own library. This is a beautiful book, but doesn't teach me anything about working with pastel colors or about composition. For that, look at ""All About Pastels"" and for hands-on practice, I loved the book ""Pastel Workbook,"" which is coming out in paperback soon. I did enjoy looking at this book from the library, but don't see a need to own it."
2,limits the light of judaism,the agadah of talmud as known is the deepest part of the talmud in its way and putting it in any sort of frame or summary needs lots of study in the deeper sections of torah like the kabalah etc. therefore for someone that truly has a idea in the great light it contains bialik limited it in a drastic way with many misquotes etc.after all deeper you understand in torah will bring you closer and enrich your connection to g_d and we saw the contrary from bialik and co.which brings us to the conclusion that many of his teachings were translated to his comfort and desire.
4,Decent strap - not for tall people though,"If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine. However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need. I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead. Very similar look and feel, but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer. The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist. Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)"
3,Works as designed,"Simple nylon guitar strap with pick pocket and leather tabs at each end. Appropiately priced. Good value. Not fancy, but who needs a fancy strap for a $90 guitar? Arrived before projected delivery date. The leather ends are VERY stiff and VERY difficult to use. Takes a good deal of effort to get them on and off the guitar."
3,"Nice product, wrong recommendation","No issues with quality of strap, however, it is not appropriate for the guitar I purchased for my son yet it was highlighted as item recommended/purchased with it. The strap requires a post to attach to the guitar but the guitar does not have it. Unless you go to a store to verify your accessory needs ahead of time, no one should purchase them when purchasing the main item."
2,Protec Guitar Strap,did not fit on the Cars Mini Guitar as it had indicated it would....it was a recommended purchase along with the guitar
3,ok strap,"this strap looks good and holds really well, but it is really hard to put on and take off. And there is a pocket to hold the picks, but they always fall out."
4,About the guitar strap,Nice guitar strap. very comfortable and for the price is really worth the money I expend...I recommended it...Love it...
1,Horrible!!!,"Ok, the problem with this guitar strap is simple. It does not stay in place. The holes in the strap do not attach themselves tightly to the guitar and therefore the strap comes out loose. If a strap does not work like a strap, what rating do you expect from me?"
2,"Functional, but not good","Nothing about this strap is very good. The band feels hard and coarse, the ends feel like a thick pleather and are very thick, and the holes are very small. I had to cut the slits larger so I could get it on my guitars without too much of a fight. It does what it advertises - holds you guitar up - but nothing more."
3,Guitar strap - not too great,"You get what you pay for.... The user says the strap is difficult to keep on the guitar when playing. Not sure she just did not like the plain black look and wanted a ""cool"" strap."
5,This will last forever.,"Usually leather belts are two layers sewn together that end up stretching and breaking at the buckle. I get about six months out of those before they start falling apart. After two years of almost daily use, this belt still looks like new. It's just one serious slab of leather that will last a really long time, like decades. I don't think I'll be looking for another belt anytime soon."
5,Trish is the hottest female alive!!!,"First off the guy who wrote the ""TRASH STRATUS"" review is a moron or maybe he just prefers ugly chicks. She has been WWE ""Babe of the Year"" 3 years in a row, Diva of the Year 2 years in a row and The DIVA OF THE DECADE! So, where do you get off falsely stating that she only has 1,000 fans? YOUR OUT OF YOUR MIND. Trish is major ""EYE CANDY""! How could you not like her? She is what every woman should like. Just check out that backside on her. It's PERFECT. Women wish they could look half as good as her. Plus she's improved her game over the years in the ring. She has sustained numerous injuries and has had some pretty dangerous moves done to her. She gets the worst end of every match she's in. She's always the one who risks getting injured more than any other WWE DIVA. Yet she still comes back for more. GIVE HER CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE! The dvd is awesome. Every Trish fan should own this. If you don't, then your not a real Trish fan. GET THIS DVD NOW!!!"
2,Trish Can Do Better Than This,"A very boring dvd and I'm a huge Trish fan. Watch it once and then sell it, like I did."
2,The Trash Stratus Show! Trash! More Trash! Then some Trash!,"There are roughly 1,000 Trash Stratus maniacs out there who live and die by Trash, and this is their DVD right here. Nothing but Trash Stratus for hour after endless hour. Sure, there are a few dozen more WWE DVD's that focus on nothing but one superstar, but never before has it been this gut wrenching. Rock, Austin, HHH... all of those guys are entertaining, have done some great things inside the ring and can use a microphone. Trash on the other hand doesn't know how to do any of those things. If you buy this, I promise it will be the most expensive non-sexual porn DVD you'll ever buy, and that's just stupid. You're money is better spent elsewhere, rather than fueling Trash's massive ego and wallet.Redeeming qualities for fans of Trash, but it'll make casual fans' minds melt. Fans of wrestling get the Shawn Michaels or Ric Flair DVD's... fans of fake breasts buy a porno.Hell, Randy Savage's album is a better buy than this."
5,Spiritual Treasure,"This is the second of her books, which I have read over and over and bought at least 20 to share with friends. Her conversations with the angel are amazingly enlightening and moving. It's especially different because she debates contemporary issues and receives new, insightful responses to things like, 'why should I pray for the shooter at the convenience store when the woman he killed left a motherless child?' How come prayer doesn't always help? 'God doesn't seem to understand how much more complex and difficult it is to live today, nor have to deal with the problems we encounter.' I have spent years studying religion and listening to clergy, but her dialogues with the angel are the most insightful and peace-engendering I've ever encountered. I totally believe her experiences are real, and so will every reader. I've asked Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergy to read it, and they all praise it very highly!!!"
4,REAL GOOD (for the price),I love it. I first thought it was one of those cheap irons which you can buy from department stores but I was wrong. It's light and heats up fast.
4,Interesting but . . . .,I found the music interesting but not nearly as much as that of the Brass Monkey or the Carnival band.
1,Decieiving,"Product was totally not what was described. Was very poorly made and when i tried to return it, they only offered me an exchange for another crappy product, gee thanks."
4,Good Alternative,"I love using straws in all my drinks so having these straws saves a lot of plastic straws from going into the trash. They are very easy to clean - I use a small thin cleaning brush to clean it on the inside.The only issue I have is that since the straws are stainless steel, when drinking cold/iced drinks, the straw itself gets very cold. Since I have sensitive teeth, sometimes it the cold metal on my teeth is annoying. But even with this issue, I will continue to use these straws as a good alternative to the plastic ones."
2,Made in China,"Are they beautiful? Yes. Are they heavy-duty? Yes. Are they helping me not buy plastic disposable straws that are also made in China? Well, yes. But...The impetus for even considering buying glass or stainless steel straws was when I looked at the bag of plastic straws we always buy and saw that they were made in China. I really wanted to buy the $30 Glass Dharma straws but this seemed like a more economical bargain. Now I know why.Be warned - these SS straws are made in China. So instead of getting the green, non-toxic, BPA-free drinking straw experience that I was seeking, now I have to worry about toxins, chemicals, poor manufacturing, and every other potential problem with products made in China.Next time, I'll just spring for the Glass Dharma straws. The $20 difference is probably worth it."
4,Stainless Steel Straws,"Works fine, the straw does get cold though so it may remind some of those ""cavity drilling"" days from the dentist when it hits your teeth. I am concerned that there is no real way of telling if the inside is getting clean in the dishwasher. It would be nice if it came with a cleaning brush."
1,Poorly designed ...,"This could be such a great easel but like another reviewer said,the bolts are not long enough. It was a replacement for a Melissa and Doug easel that fell apart and I also don't want to deal with sending it back, so I willl attempt to fix it myself."
5,Great,"There's not too much you can say about straws, but these work great. My kids love them and I just throw them in the dishwasher when they're dirty."
3,Stainless Steel Drinking Straws,I love the fact that these are stainless steel and can be reused and replace the plastic straws. The down size it that they are not long enough. This is a great product but I wish they were longer.
4,good for sipping hot drinks,These were suggested by sparkpeople.com. Good for sipping drinks while traveling. Especially good for sipping hot drinks while moving. They are what I was hoping they would be.
4,Really nice for cold drinks...,"We bought these along with some polycarbonate straws (which we use for smoothies) to see what we liked better. These are narrower and good for clear liquids like water, tea, juices, etc. My 6 yr.old daughter likes these because they are bent and easier for her to reach at the table. The stainless steel feels really nice and cool with icy drinks. The ends are very smooth, very good quality. However they are really much stronger than regular or polycarbonate straws, so I wouldn't recommend for little ones or rambuctious children/adults."
1,THE LAZARUS PHENOMEN,IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND FROM A LANGUAGE PROSPECTIVE. I WOULD NOT ADVISE ORDERING THIS MOVIE. THE NARATOR WAS SPOOKY!!!!
3,Powerful message,"Some incredible stories of after-death experiences. Could be a useful evangelistic tool. On the negative side, the presentation has too much of a ""Halloween mystery made for TV"" feel to it."
3,basically ping pong balls,"These are basically ping pong balls that you hit with a golf club. They work, in that they don't go very far, but I don't feel like they're very helpful because you don't really have any idea where a real ball would go. They may serve a purpose for other golfers, but I don't really like them. I prefer the more foamish balls that have a little bit more weight and go further without going as far as a normal golf ball."
1,"The only reson I gave it 1 star is ,,,,","becasue it didnt have a ""no star"" option...I have watched this show since the very beginning and the only thing this guy is talking about is how bad a show it is...well, considering that the majority of people who watch it are atleast 13 then the violence and ""action"" is what they want to see any way...and the only reason this guy wrote this book is because he feels that...for reasons beyond my understanding...he feels he has the right to say whatever he wants about things he dont even know about...quite frankly...this book is not even worth a dollar and the only thing i would use it for is fuel for a fire."
1,The REAL Truth About Power Rangers,"Power Rangers started off with a low budget compared to today, but has steadily escalated. Power Rangers now uses expensive, well designed sets. Of course it has violence -- how else can a group of heroes save the Earth from evil forces? I have never heard ""acid rock music"" on the show. What is wrong with martial arts in a show? I see no harm in exposing children to a practice that teaches self-respect, morals, and much more. I'd love to see examples of sexual iNNuendos on Power Rangers, other than the ""nice stems"" line. You may read way too deep into things. Occult? Are you talking about a sorcerer sending down monsters to battle spandex-clad superheroes? Power Rangers has more than a quick moral for governmental standards. It provides lessons for people of all ages throughout the show. And if you think THIS show is horrible, check out some tokusatsu shows that Power Rangers is based on."
5,Party ready,"Quite why this album is not more available is a mystery, as it's generally been acclaimed as one of the best soul/funk releases of '98. It's worth forking out the extra for the Japanese import release, though, because it includes a second disc of remixes of the album's two singles, ""Expansions"" and ""Mothership Reconnection"": the 5 versions of ""Expansions"" are mixed by the likes of Joe Clausell and the Ballistic Brothers (Ashley Beedle), while ""Mothership..."" is reworked by Slam and the flavour of the month, Daft Punk. A choice set."
3,A great series of anecdotes about old Shanghai,"Allman went to China as a consular officer. In that capacity he was appointed as American assessor (at that time effectively co-judge) on the Mixed Court on Shanghai. He then resigned from consular service and became a lawyer practicing before the United States Court for China, the Mixed Court and other foreign courts in Shanghai until 1941.He tells numerous stories of his time as a consular officer, judge and lawyer, including the time he was on a Japanese blacklist and his internment in Hong Kong at the beginning of World War 2. A fun and easy to read book."
2,yuck,"I didnt like this game at all. It was way to long and to tell you the truth, boreing. It takes you so long to get food and then to feed you're troops and then you attack and then youre troops need More food and you're little surfs cannot deal with feeding your dudes and doing stuff around town. Your wepons makers are wayyyy too slow.ok so it is not all bad, it is still an ok IDEA for a game. But could be re-done. if you want a game like this but 65 time better, play stronghold."
3,NOT HIS BASSEST HIT,"I would call myself a DJ Magic Mike fan, and if pure bass is what you're looking for, don't buy this. I'd reccommend one of his other CD's,""Foundations of Bass"". But this CD is more lyrical than his other albums and is not very good in my opinion. There are a few tight tracks, but the overall CD is not very good. Track 3 is just plain tight. So, if you want some mediocre rap with good bass, buy this CD. If you just want beats with big bass, buy Foundations of Bass or some other CD."
2,Does Not Fit,The M4 / AR15 Tri-Rail Barrel Mount will not fit a Bushmaster Ar-15 M4A3 to small and improper inserts. Seems like made of junk quaility metal as well. Do not buy it from AirSplat.
1,Chaque un a son gout,"I got this for free, so I most likely shouldn't complain, but lord is it bad. Well, some of it is just mediocre, but the oversll effect is like listening to a cat slide down a chalk board. Derivative, badly acted, badly paced, just unfunny. Most likely I'm missing something because millions of people watch it, but before you buy more than one episode, watch one. Then decide. Caveat emptor. (Yes, I know the French and Latin are pretentious and may even be wrong, but this show really annoyed me - my wife hated it even more.)"
5,Reissue Live Recording,"I bought this cd not knowing what the track listing was, and was disappointed to find out it is just a reissue of ""The Rising Sun Collection"" which has long since been deleted. I give it 5 Stars because i am a Taj fan, and if you are too, you should have this live recording in your collection too :)"
3,Not much different from every other jog bra,"The best thing about it is the straps don't crisscross in the back and aren't so close to your neck you see them when wearing certain styles. As far as bounce, this wasn't stopped drastically, can't say its much different than other bras I have. It is comfortable though."
5,Good Product for the price,I am happy with my purchase of this steering wheel. I installed it on my bass boat and works great.
3,The Norton Anthology of Poetry (shorter version),"It was not clear when I selected this book on line that it was the shorter version of the 5th edition. Since I am using this for assigned readings in a poetry course, none of the assigned pages are relevant and about 20% of the assigned poems are not in the shorter version, both of which shortcomings handicap my use of the book."
2,Index?,"The only index for this book that is viewable online is the index of a previous edition. Maybe the indexs are the same, but I bought the wrong edition because of the index confusion."
2,NO DELTA... NO SHOW!,THERE WAS A SYNERGY AMONG THE ORIGINAL 4 -- WHEN THEY GOT RID OF DELTA BURKE IT WAS NEVER AS GOOD!
2,By Far The Worst Season,I am glad however to see that they are going to end up releasing the whole series and that Designing Women won't see the same fate as one of my other favs The Nanny. I however will not be buying season 6 because it's dreadful but may buy season 7.
3,How about some great sound?,Where is the sound? If you are a Shania fan you will love the crystal clear picture quality of this DVD....but the sound is terrible. The VHS versions of her videos is far superior to this effort.
3,FAIR choice for a laptop cooler,"I ordered two of the Eforcity coolers for my laptops. They cool Ok if I use thm on a table or desk, but they fail miserably when you want to use the laptop in bed on your legs, etc. as the airflow is blocked since it comes from te bottom instead of the side. The Antec laptop cooler is far better as the air flows in from the side and out the top so you can use it anywhere. The one good reason to use the Eforcity cooler is that it can accept 4 USB plugs which is a great option. Be careful which cooler you choose!"
2,Disappointing User Interface,"Go Video removed the capability to play Video CD's (VCD) from this model, compared to their pre-2003 models. Why?Secondly, there is a critical flaw in their 'human factors' when they designed the remote control: While playing DVD's or CD's, to fast-forward, you have to press and hold the fast-forward button. If you just press the button quickly, it resets the movie to the beginning. What a pain in the neck.Third: I still haven't figured-out how to change the display to show the track and time for a CD. The default is a counter that counts the seconds of the song, but you have no idea what song you're on.As a Mechanical Engineer, the poor human-factors design of this remote gives our profession a bad name!"
5,Perfect upgrade for my Tippmann Army Alpha,"I play paintball every month or so and bought an Army Alpha. Great gun but it did not have any rails. This thing fits perfectly and has allowed me to change the whole way I play paintball. Now I can use all sorts of accessories that are mounted on top.Since I bought mine for an Army Alpha, it required that I tap a hole through the carry handle to be able to mount this. Not a problem. Just got out my drill and a slightly larger bit than the mounting screw and that solved my problem.So far I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Slow and expensive Shipping,"This is a very good product, good quality and very well designed. But the shipping cost is very high(more than the 50% of the real price) and shipping is extremly slow."
3,Decent industrial-metal,"I first heard the track, ""Rage"" in a club in 1993. The rest of the cd is pretty good. It is not a concept album, but it does move from song to song with bridges composed of interesting ambience."
3,Ridiculous fun,"Okay, it's really silly. An alien race constructed a Vegas casino because they felt bad for a lost 20th century astronaut. The away team gets trapped inside and loses communication with the Enterprise! Can they escape?Not exactly a nail-biting premise.But it's great fun. Data shoots craps like a king, Worf growls at the room service staff and generally looks bewildered, and Riker gleefully gets into the swing of things. Chalk this one up under gulity-pleasure viewing, and definitely don't take it seriously."
3,Good concept but not clarity,"The concept of this Meridian Chat is very nice. But one can not see the points well. The Chinese meridian chat are always confuse, they do not show the meridians with one collor to each meridian. If you are not familiar with it, you probably wont like it. I hope, in the future, the editor can make it better, using the same concept (one meridian at the time)."
2,Should Be R Rated,"70% boobs and 20% ass, nothing more however very good video quality. This video would be ""hot"" if you are 15 or don't get out much."
5,Dibetic feet,I find this cream to be very helpfull for my Dads feet and shipping & Pkging was exelent would invite to purchace from you again
3,"Helpful tips, excruciating read","This book attempts to help journalists figure out the thought process that goes into organizing stories. To that end, this is a helpful tool for anyone who has struggled to piece together all the facts of a complicated story as well as coaches who are helping writers organize their thoughts into a coherent, flowing series of sentences. The problem is that it also is a difficult read that is full of complicated flowcharts and takes a long time to get to the point. But if you can get through it, you will come away with a better understanding of just how it is you get from the notetaking stage to the printed page -- even if you've never thought about it before."
4,Handy,"I got this because I constantly forget things. I might put a pot on the stove and run to check email then get caught up and forget the fact that I am cooking something. Having this to put around my neck makes it possible for me to do other things and remember to go back to the stove (or finish pre-soaking laundry for 10 minutes, etc.). The buzzer isn't too loud either so it doesn't scare me when it goes off. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that there is a magnet on the back. I'm never sure if that will interfere with my heart or something, it probably doesn't, but if you have a pacemaker think twice before getting this unless you plan on not wearing it and just using it as a kitchen timer on the fridge or something."
4,60 minute timer on a rope,forget pots and pans on the stove and this helps to remind me ... wish the ringer was a bit louder.
5,Collection Worth Having,Everyone should experience this collection for the first time and over and over again. This has been a true gift preserved in time by DVD.
4,Great remote; don't lose the instructions,"I lost the directions (with the remote codes) to this, and I can't seem to find them online anywhere. Oh, well.Other than that, it's a great remote, and it actually WILL pass along receiver volume controls. The trick is, you have to override the volume up, volume down, and mute buttons in the TELEVISION mode with learned frequencies from your receiver's remote. If the remote will control your receiver while in TV mode, it automatically passes along the customized codes to all the other modes, too.Works great."
4,Not a bad remote at all,"I only have a couple of problems with this remote. You have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd, vcr, audio, sat, etc. to change the setting. That sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and I am. (sue me. ha ha) The other is this. I bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working. I can't teach it the functions that I need through the ""learn"" command since the orginal remote quit. Which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote. I have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote wouldn't allow me to set the VCR clock and local channels after a power outage.Other than that, I have no problem with it."
2,Inconsistent quality,"The first PMDVR8 I owned worked extremely well for about 2 years. After it began to fail, I purchased 2 more. One of the two never worked consistently and failed completely in about a month. The other failed in about 4 months of light use. Even inexpensive remotes should last longer."
4,Usable replacement for most multifunction remote controls.,"I needed a a new remote because the one that came with my ReplayTV had stoped functioning, the most used push buttons had, properly. I needed a remote that would control atleast six components and the Magnavox PMDVR8-8 device remote was right for me. It also had three programable macro programs that come in handy. Did I mention a good remote at a great price? Well it is. Only down side was, like any universal replacement remote it will not replicate all the functions of the OEM remotes that it replaces. However I am more than well pleased with my choice of a universal remote and as always it's a pleasure doing business with Amazon."
1,Not for Home Theater or HD systems,The box said this is good for home video but it is NOT suitable for such use. The volume contol only works with the TV directly and cannot be changed to control the home theater amplifer. I was unable to learn commands from my Sony AV remote control. Switching from one device to another requires multiple button pushes to change the TV and amp. Of course there are no commands for HD sets like wide-screen format button or HD/TV mode button required for Phillips HD TV sets.
1,ADVICE PLEASE,"I am trying to get this remote to work with my PHILIPS 900-series reciever. I can get it to do most things, but not switch inputs. I can't beleive that Philips would build a universal remote that would not even control their own products. Has anyone else had similar problems? Am I doing something wrong?"
5,yoshi island super mario advance 3,"this game is brilliant...and it lasts for ages,i have spent a long time at this game but i never once tired of it .it has countless levels where you (yoshi) try to unite the mario bro's,its great fun,great graphics,very puzzling at some points and it lasts a Very long time!!one of the best game boy games i've ever played - 5 stars!!!"
4,GRANDSON AGE 8 LOVES THIS ONE JUST GET THE GUIDE TOO,"MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS ONE .. JUST BUY THE GUIDE, HE FOUND THAT TO BE HELPFUL AND ZOOMS RIGHT THOUGH IT."
1,THEY DO NOT REALLY HAVE THIS DEVICE,"I ordered this item and was instead shipped the BT2000D-CFThat additional ""D"" in the model name is very important - it signals the switch to a different chipset that is NOT supported by anywhere near as many devices."
5,"""When God's People Start Prayin""","I found this book to be inspiring and illuminating. Not only does this book explore the revival sweeping the land of Argentina through the instruments God has choosen to use, but it also gives the reader practical application for partnering with God to bring revival to other parts of the world. As a personal fan of Wagner, I find this book to be one of his greatest. With collaboration from other writers Wagner gives insight on how to keep the ""fire"" burning and how to keep the ""fire"" growing. I challenge all non-believers and strict dogmatic christians to ""taste and see that the Lord is good"" in the Rising Revival!"
5,Changed My Life!,"This book literally changed my life. I've never been healthier since I learned to cook for myself from this book. Although I now use the recipes found in the book from time to time, it set the standard for how I eat."
5,A favorite cookbook from the past,This edition is the best. Bought used and in very good condition. The tomato sauce recipe and pizza crust recipes are worth the price alone. Buy it in hardback. Great for your collection.
1,Did not work for me...,"Not sure if the three vehicles I tried it on were past help. This product is for radiators, not gaskets or block cracks. But the one that has a pinhole radiator leak was not fixed either. I would not buy this product again. Note: I followed the directions, but did not adjust for colder climates, the error may still have been mine."
2,Really wanted to love this product,My first facial brush; Love at first sight! Never had I used anything that cleaned my face more profoundly and then... it died on me less than a month later. :\ No amount of tinkering got it working again. Maybe it was just a dud but it was a big disappointment at the same time.
1,Not impressed,All it does is vibrate. I thought the brushes/sponges rotated in a circular motion or did something fabulous. I don't think it's worth the money.
3,Good but may be overpriced,I have had this for about a year and I like. The brush part works great and the cream that comes with this is very good. The sponge side of this (the smaller one you use for your face) came unglued after about 8 uses! I contacted Derma New and the amazon seller but I didn't get anywhere. So now I am just using the large body sponge on my face. I like how this works on my skin it def makes a difference and I will continue to use it but I think this system is over priced. I would check out a drug store version first before ordering this.
2,DermaNew,returned item because the cream made my face burn and get red better off with the neutrogena kit and a lot less money also
2,Overhyped with little value,I am concurring with the review written by user 'SasyApron'.After using it for a couple of times I can say that is not worth the money. The face pads are cheaply made and they wear away within 2 weeks. The body applicator and brush are something we never use. On top of that to buy the pads again it will cost you another $15 that disintegrate after 3-4 uses. So it is a rip off scam for a cheaply made product.
2,Does it work?,"The ionizer is perfectly silent with just a blue light, the only problem I have is an inability to see if it works. It does not perform miracles, thats for sure. I have found that after people smoke cigarettes in my car, if I leave the device on when I leave my car it does not seem to smell as stale the next time I sit down. This may just be my own imagination hoping the purchase was worth it. The device needs an auto turn off since remembering to turn it off every time can be a hassle. Overall I am not sure how well it works and how it would manage to clean the air of my entire car since it does not blow the air to the back. I would pass on this purchase and just buy an air freshener for smell cover instead of hoping for smell elimination."
4,good but hard,"I have used this dvd 3 or 4 times. I do like the relaxing aspects of it but it is very hard. I can only do the first level called easy street. I tried the 2nd level and gave up after 20 minutes.Still I get some benefit from it although it is a bit hard on my hip muscles. I'm 50. I think it's better for younger, more flexible, and athletic people.I do like the guy who leads the poses. He does a good job."
1,Loved the classes but DVD quality was terrible,"I loved this DVD the few times I used it, but it kept freezing. I returned it, Amazon promptly sent me a new one, which did the same thing. What a shame."
2,It did not do the job.,Perhaps this product does not work alone. Would not buy again.Very thick in dogs ears. Not recommended by myself.
4,It works,Use this product to clean out the hair in my Shihtzu's ears... which are ongoing and numerous. Helps to grab the ones that are difficult and makes it easier for the pup.
3,"great concept, flawed delivery","The book has a great concept. After losing her memory, or maybe having switched bodies with a man, Frankie first has to gain her boyfriend's help in trying to get her back into the right body. The power dynamics of the relationship and how each tortures each other as they doubt each other is wonderful. But often the book gets bogged down with random medical documents in an attempt at grounding it and most of the emotional drive of the realtionship are underplayed or repeated over several chapters. An interesting try at a great concept though."
4,NHL 2003 : Solid but not great,"NHL 2003 continues the long excellence of the NHL series by EA Sports. NHL 2002 was a big step forward by EA Sports in the hockey franchise but this years release 2003 is not that much of a step up.The graphics are a bit choppy and not as clean as last years version, and game play can be choppy at times too.I am enjoying NHL 2003 but i miss 2002. I really wish the gameplay from 2002 would have been kept with some tweaks to rosters and menus. But that is not the case.It appears that while they tried to advance and add to last years version that lost a little in overall graphics and gameplay.NHL 2003 is still a strong title and if you have yet to buy a hockey game for PS2 this is a good choice.If you have NHL 2002 do not spend the 50$ on this years version, it isnt worth it."
1,"Please, take my word and don't buy this version!","I am a die-hard hockey fan, have all of the other EA Sports versions of NHL for the PC and this is the worst one ever. First of all, it crashed my hard drive because of DirectX 9 and the game play is slow and choppy no matter how up to date your computer is or how much you adjust the display and game settings.Save your money for NHL 2004. This one is not worth it!!"
4,NHL 2003 is a Good Game,Hey Guys and Girls Since your reading this review you must be intrested in buying this game. WELL DO IT! This is a great game. For all you Hocky Fans and even if your not if you like sports games this is a great game. The controlls are easily set up for good gameplay. And the Franchise mode is Great fun. you can draft sign free agenst trade and all that. all the teams are pretty accurate. And it has pretty good graphics. The music is cool to. So stop reading reviews and go buy it! i promise its a good buy!
4,I gotta laugh at all these reviews,"What's crazy is that I think this is, by far, the best EA game yet!! I have to laugh at all the negative reviews others have givin this game...are we all talking about the same game?? When you are half way into your third season and still hearing new commentary which by the way is hilarious I think that says something...It is a riot to play...alone or with a friend. I've had countless hours of pure enjoyment and I plan to have many more with a real classic!!One more thing...It's waaaaaaay better then the new 2004 edition!!"
5,Wonderful..,"I absolutely loved this story. Luke was so tortured over being (about to be) executed for something he didn't do. Then to be thrown back in time, still tortured. Sofie was great with her amnesia and remembering a little at a time. And the ending was so fantastic. It all came together and they lived HEA. Sooo, I'm going to see what else Ms. Stover has to offer.Recommend this book to ALL time travel romance readers."
4,Hood,This hood is very warm and covers most of your face. The only drawback was the hood is on the small side.
4,Celebrate Spring,"The book wasn't as big as I expected it to be, I was hoping it would be more like the ""Summer"" & ""Autumn"" cook books."
5,Adam-12 Seasom Seven,"I loved this DVD. It was well organized, the episodes were easy to access. I think this was the best season of all seven. The chemistry between Kent McCord and Martin Milner took front row seating and the stories had a more human tone. We got a glimpse into Reed's home life and Malloy's abilities as a commander. I wasn't really happy with the last three episodes as Malloy and Reed were seperated much of the time. I got the distinct impression the producers were trying to spin-off Kent McCord in an Adam-12 clone. But, all in all, very satisfied."
5,adam-12 season seven,"even though i won't be getting this final season of adam-12 until april 10,2012,i still want to say how badly my family and i are waiting for it to arrive. this show has got be the greatest cop show ever put on television.it is our #1 favorite cop show of all time.every season we buy we try to stretch it out over acouple of months so we don't run out of episodes to soon.but it does'nt work out that way.we like adam-12 so much that we run out of episodes within a week's time.so in closing i and my family have to agree with one other fan of adam-12 go reed and malloy.CAN'T WAIT,CAN'T WAIT,CAN'T WAIT. my mom just said the 7th season can't get here soon enough.""chrisfan"""
3,Shipped wrong item,I ordered Silikroil but got a case of Aerokroil. Not a complete loss since I can use the Aerokroil. The product is excellent.
1,Does not work with Panther,"Be sure to check MacPlay's website for updates BEFORE buying this game. I bought it at the same time as Panther, only to discover that it doesn't work with OS 10.3. MacPlay has not given a timeline for fixing this problem.Update: 10.3.3 did NOT fix the problem. Still no timeline for a fix.Update: it works now with Panther. Not as good as the original, but still pretty fun."
2,"Unplayable on Panther, Indeed!","This game has been out far too long for there to be any excuse for its current state. When you attempt to play this game in 10.3, as soon as a level loads, all the sounds for that level begin playing simultaneously.It's completely disorienting and makes the game impossible to play. Macplay is aware of this issue and is apparently either unwilling or unable to do anything about it.If you're running 10.2, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you have 10.3 or are planning to upgrade, stay away. It doesn't work.Anxiously awaiting a patch but losing faith that there will ever be one."
1,"Boring, painfully vapid","Ok, I'm not a fan. I bought this CD because I like folk music, and the song ""The World Ain't Slowin Down"". The music on this album is fine, but the lyrics are so consistently vapid that I was disgusted that he dares mention Woodie Guthrie as his inspiration. Woodie sung about things going on, events of the past and hopes for the future. Woodie sang with social conscience and relevance. This guy sings like if he's scrawling on a bathroom wall--and has NOTHING to say. Granted 90+% of singers/songs do the same, and nobody seems to notice any lack, so my complaint is from the minority, but there you have it. (As a final insult, the last track moans and whines and destroys a song written by Woodie)I listened to every song. I hated this CD, I'm selling it immediately, and I demand my two hours back!"
1,Why can't you use this on a wooden swingset?,"Nowhere on the advertising for this product did the manufacturer state that this product could not be used on a wooden swing set. Why? I recieved it in the mail and on the box is the ""Not to be used on wooden swingsets"" message but not why.I wish I'd known that I couldn't use it BEFORE i bought it."
3,a few things to think about,"We have had these weights for about a week and they work great. I have no complaints about how they work. However, I wish I had thought a few things through before I bought them. I hope this helps you:-They are not for use when the temperature gets below freezing.-My three year old keeps letting the water out.-They are plastic so you cannot use your grass/weed trimmer around them."
5,Easy to use and work wonderfully!!!!,"After a terrible time trying to get those metal anchors into our yard to secure our swingset, I ran across these on the internet. They are SO EASY to install and did aGREAT job of anchoring the swingset. You can move the swingset around the yard and it is easy to empty the tubes in the winter to prevent freezing. You do need to be careful about using the weedwacker or clippers around them. You will not be unhappy with these!!!"
4,Peaceful and Fun!,I like how this video starts with the explanation of African dance and how it connects with our spirit and environment. This really helps set the tone for the workout. It is a very good and relaxing workout.
3,"freestyle exercise and mental focus, then it gets hard","The thing I really liked about this video was the whole first segment, which is a workout in itself especially for beginners. In that segment, Wyoma encourages you to discover your body and make it into an art. By devoting your spirit to trying to emulate an elephant or different kinds of fire, you are willing to devote more time and energy to working out. There is a spiritual door you can pass through as well and this dance can help you find peace with yourself and your body and your ancestors and the outside world, too.Just when I thought it was all over, I realized that was just the beginning. The peace kind of dissipated in the *actual* dances. I'm not the most coordinated person out there, and I spent a lot of time tripping over my feet and cussing at the screen. With a lot more effort I might learn the steps and learn how to move my body in ways it's never moved before. And I would like to, but it will probably take a long time."
3,AFRICAN DANCE,"This is a fun DVD! You get a different perspective on dance as compared to MED. Some of these moves made my low back pretty tired. That is alright because I have a NUCCA practitioner! Anyway, I do like it and may use it with children or a ladies group!"
3,Not for beginners,For someone who isn't a stranger to African dancing I found the instruction catered more to the intermediate or advanced dancer. At times some of the steps could have been broken down more for the dances. I felt that Wyoma and her dancers were more into giving a show then teaching African dance steps. This wasn't a good investment in my money at all!!!
1,Stainless steel-should read: PLASTIC,"The description is stainless steel, but I just received mine today and am very disappointed. The shell is stainless steel, but the front is PLASTIC! This unit is made to be put under the counter, so all you see is the front plastic frame. From the picture shown, you can't tell, it just looks like the lighting makes is a different color. I just purchased stainless steel applicances and this wine chiller just sticks out like a sore (ugly) thumb!"
4,"stylish, functional",Worked perfect for our Audioengine 5 speakers. Filled the tube with BB's and they're even more stable.
1,Pretty much a limited use kitchen tongs,"I purchased these tongs since they were on sale and I was intrigued on their usefulness (it was that word ""precision""). You open and close the tong pinchers by pushing or pulling the neoprene (rubber) cover on the opposite end of the pinchers. But the tong hinge does not keep the pinchers consistently aligned. Well, so much for precision. In spite of this, I can still pick up items.The bottom line is that my EdlundEdlund Restaurant Tongs - Scalloped: 12 INCH(made in the USA) stainless steel kitchen tongs remain my primary and most useful kitchen tongs (I have them in three sizes for whatever the task). About the only thing I cannot use them for is safely removing my ramekins from a bain-marie.PROS: Can't think of any.CONS: The hinge does not keep the tong pinchers consistently aligned. Some small round items (broccoli and cauliflower flowerets) are not as easy to grab. The pinchers have a small size bowl that limits how much it can grab at one time."
5,Super Good,I am using it right now. It is the fifth day and my teeth are all white. But I will finish the whole things anyway. I love it. Although it hurts my gun a little bit but it is not that bad.
2,It works....with a cost to your teeth and gums,"If the only thing you want to know is whether or not this product whitens your teeth, it does. However, there are some caveats:1) It works only on yellow stains2) May require two units (ie two packages) for heavily stained teeth3) The hydrogen peroxide (the stuff that whitens your teeth) can burn your gums (it did for me). If this happens to you, stop immediately and let your gums heal. Give it a few days and then reapply. If it still burns, discontinue the product. Also, this product is not for people with sensitive teeth and it inflammes the inner nerves of your teeth.ALternative, try the Crest Night Effects. You get to control what teeth gets whitened and it doesn't burn your gums or teeth."
3,They're A Great Starter....,"I am only 14, so my teeth have no stains or age spots. My teeth before - hand were not very white, and after the first 3 days I was very pleased with the results, but between days 3 and 10, i did not see much more improvement, in the end, my teeth became whiter, but not the glowing effect that I hoped for. I ordered a gel formula from Amazon2 - Professional 35% Tooth Whitening Kits with New FCP Enamel Boosters / 20ML Optimized Formula By Watts Power Whitethat i think will give my teeth the glow that I desire after the start from the White Strips, overall, I'm not a huge fan of White Strips due to their not-so-stunning results."
2,crest whitestrips pro,I really don't see any changes using this product. I think that the trays work better.
3,3.5 stars: Day 4,"I'm on day 4 of the kit. So far, I do see a notable difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Nothing spectacular, but they do look better. The part about the pain is true, although it was worse on day 1 and 2, and today I don't really feel any sensitivity any more, maybe I'm getting used to it. The strips are a PAIN to keep on though. You have to keep your mouth as still as possible, and they also make you salivate a lot more than usual which doesn't really help either. I also think they're too expensive but if you're looking for a wuick fix for your teeth then i do recommend it."
4,Gets the job done.,"If you want to whiten your teeth, these get the job done for a pretty good price. I was happy with the results, but I was expecting whiter teeth honestly! But they did take a lot of yellow out and I suppose if I wanted to go back and do the kit again, I'd get closer what I was looking for. Anyway, if you're looking for a great basic whitening kit, I do suggest this. But don't expect professionally whitened teeth!"
1,Don't Like,The strips do not stay on esp the bottom ones. Every time I try to use them I just get frustrated because they do not stay in place. I should have spent the extra money for different ones.
1,Garbage,This book is a waste of money. I gives the appearance of being written in the 1970's. I would recommend the USMC Clost-Quarters Combat Manual instead.
2,Wanted to like this book but...,"It's basically the author making the point that it's stupid to find yourself in a knife fight. Look at that, I made it in one sentence! and I didn't charge you anything to read it! I thought it would describe some techniques or strategies that could improve your odds of surviving a knife fight. These strategies do exist as I have learned some of them in various martial arts classes. Not to say they're perfect or ideal, but I am glad to know them. This book, on the other hand, offered nothing of practical value, except for the point I made in the first sentence. Should have saved my money."
5,Secola Rocks!,"I have had this CD for quite a while. I am a Native American music fan and while cruising the Native American awards list saw him listed. I originally had heard a sample on a clip on music match. I found the CD and loved the music. Of all my Native American CD's this one besides Mirabel and Locke is my absolute favorite. ""Drums in the Car"" is funny and fun to listen to.Worth every penny paid for it. Received the Best Folk/Blues Recording Artist (Native American Music Awards), and now up for Aboriginal Peoples Choice Award for same category. Keith is a wonderful songwriter, producer, artist. He has a wonderful outlook on life and has a great sense of humour."
5,great game,"I rented this game from Blockbuster and I have to say that it was alot more than I expected. As time goes on in your town, you can get more furniture, add a second story, and wait to see if your friend will understand the letter you just sent. People (or animals) will leave the town and new people will come in their place. You might go raid the dump one day, go bug-hunting and fishing the next day, and buy a big-screen TV from Tom Nook's after that. This game has a lot more stuff to it but I'll leave you to figure that out.P.S: This game takes up 59 blocks of memory, so be prepared!"
3,"animal crossing-cute, but definately not addictive","this little game is probably intended for younger audiences. it's cute, but if someone asked, ""should i save up for it"" i'd say, ""no. rent it for 2 days and send it back."" there's no seat-of-the-pants danger, no beautiful princesses to be rescued from a dragon-guarded castle. once again, a weekend rental, folks. you get to lay back and live your life on the gamecube as a strange little animal person. unless you're a lay-back, i'd-rather-live-my-life-on-the-gamecube kind of person, you don't get much out of it, except for restarting the game and making the little mole guy pop out of the ground and tell you off and get really angry, which i find amusing. otherwise...no."
1,A game for two year olds.,The game wasn't what I expected. They were advertising to a teen audience but the game is for little kids. There is nothing to do there except run around in circles and talk to a stump outside you house.It's all too childish for myself. So I gave it a single star. If you are (or have a child) around the ages of 6-10... then this is your game... otherwise I wouldn't bother.
5,Unbeleiveble Fun,"This game is so much fun! You get to make your own house and gradually get a bigger and bigger one. There is so much furniture in the game that it would take a lifetime to collect it all. you get to make your town a better place and the store in your town will get bigger. And every town is different, each with a different fruit. Get this game i have had it for over a year and still not tired of it."
5,This game is so much fun!,"This game is a really fun game because it has a wide variety of animals.each animal has a different personality! Also, you design everything.YOU choose where you want to put things into your house. YOU choose what plants to...well.....plant! and YOU choose when you want to hit people witha net ^_^. There are so many things to say. but i have a limited amout of space to write in.Overall: Buy this game. I mean really. Its worth the money!"
4,How good is Animal Crossing?,"Animal Crossing is a more kid-friendly version of The Sims.You are a person. Your neighbors are animals. You can talk to them, do favors or even sometimes gamble in a way! There are different town events to participate in. You can sometimes get items from participating. You can shop, design clothes or an umbrella, write letters, and go on or set up treasure hunts and much more. However sometimes you loose a lot of Bells [your town's money] by gambling or buying something. You can earn it back by either fishing, catching bugs, or finding fossils. All in all it is avery good game and I would suggest it."
4,One of the most addictive games,"I recently purchased this game, and when I got home I went direcly to my GameCube. When I started playing I learned that instead of using dollars, you use Bells. Not only do you start off with a very small house you don't even have enough Bells for it. The animal who sold you the house tells you that you can have it but you have to pay off all the debt. Once you pay off all your debt you upgrade your house and you're in debt again. You may keep upgrading your house until you can't upgrade anymore. You can also make animal friends, obtain special items, and more. It is also fun because it's like real life,(i.e.) in the Winter it snows. In Autumn the leaves change color. There are also real life, and made up Holidays. Like, Toy Day (made up Holiday) or Christmas. I also suggest getting a strategy guide. It really helps. A game of patience."
2,Is it worth it?,"No, it's not really. It's fun at the beginning when you start off you're life, but after a while it can become quite boring. After you've gotten lots of items and you think that you are doing really well, the boring police take this game and transform it into the most boring game ever. In my file, Joey Jr., I've based my life on collecting all the tunes, because that's the only fun thing in the whole stink'n game! Unless you can find this game for under $15.00, it's not worth it. And, if you decide to buy this game, make sure it comes with it's own memory card, or else you'll have to waste your money on a little square box. But, I don't think you should even buy it at all."
4,flashback,"nice collection of 10 original foreigner tunes.you could always put on the am / fm radio in the late70's and be sure to hear foreigners newest hit.some are left out that could have fit within thecd like double vision, head games, feels like the firsttime but for a used item,1 cent plus shipping you get agreat rocking cd."
5,Works great with all my devices,"My remote went out on my Series one Sony SVR-2000 Tivo box and a replacement remote was $99 new and $78 used. Forget that. This remote works with my TIVO, Sony TV, Phillips Stereo, General Instrument cable box, Sony DVD player, and even my JVC VCR. Setup took 2 minutes for 6 devices!!! Best money I ever spent."
3,Confusing to program,"I had had another ""One For All"" remote, and was very satisfied with it. However, I found this one confusing to program...and the manual was not very helpful. After trials and lots of errors, I managed to get my TV to work with it. At that point, I just gave up...and was just ""grateful"" that it worked with my TV."
3,Doesn't work well on combo vcr/dvd player!,"I tried several different codes to get it to work on my approx. 3 year old combination DVD player/VCR put it has a lot of trouble switching between the two and running the two. I just got a DVR from Verizon Fios and they gave me an all in one that works MUCH better than this one. I have to say I was disappointed with this. It did work pretty well on my television itself, though."
1,didn't work for my dvd player,"This was listed as compatible with daewoo dvd players, but did not work for mine. Customer support said that I would have to ship the remote to them and they would re-program it, which didn't seem worthwhile for such a cheap product."
2,Low value for money,"This book could have been of practical value if the so-called author had written it, instead of it being a collection of his transcribed lectures. Throughout the book, he inveighs against ""abstraction, generalization, summary, analysis and interpretation."" In other words, a dogmatic application of the ""show, don't tell"", which some writing instructors may not agree. He also introduces ""dreamstorming"" instead of ""brainstorming"" when a writer searches for ideas. Unfortunately, there are no practical details of the technique. Chapter eight, ""The Anecdote Exercise,"" is useful as it shows the line of self-questioning a writer can take to evoke sharper images for writing descriptions. Given its maverick format, this book is useless as a desk reference, however."
3,Good ingredients but half-baked,"This book is brimming with insights into Butler's personal creative process, but the choice to transcribe his lectures rather than write a book based on his ideas is, in the end, frustrating. I will say that by literally capturing his extemporaneous lectures, the book does manage to convey Butler's effervescent enthusiasm for the art of writing. Butler clearly thrives on interaction with his students. Unfortunately, that ability to interact is lost in the transition from lecture hall to text.The bottom line here, is that while there are a lot of gems in this book, they are not polished, and sometimes they are hidden halfway in a rambling story. It's the sort of book that you'll want to take notes from (and some of it is enviably quotable), but it's not a desktop reference or a how-to book, so you might be better off borrowing it from a friend or a library."
5,Insights from one of America's best fiction writer/teacher,"Dream, yearn, write. Learn how to put yourself in the creative state of mind. Fiction is cinema...That's what I'm doing via this book and Bob Butler's online presentations, a bootcamp for creative writing. Going from nonfiction to fiction has not been the same since I picked up this book two months ago. Breaking intellectual tendencies and derive from emotions is key, easier read than done.This is THE book I will recommend to aspiring novelists."
2,No as pictured and size larger then normal,The pictures of the vibe blue show a matching blue C and hood liner. What I received was a vibe blue (navy) with a grey C logo and a gray hood liner. Also I ordered a medium but my average length arms are to short to properly fit into the ginormous length of the sleeves.
1,InSinkErator Hot Cold Water Dispenser,"This is one of the most poorly designed pieces of household equipmet I have had the ""dis""pleasure of owning. Since purchasing and installing the unit just over 3 years ago, I have had to replace the stainless steel tank twice (the water started coming out rust colored)and now the hot/cold water dispenser unit has failed (the cold water handle does not dispense wayer). when working, the unit is great, but 3 major malfunctions in 3 years - C'mon. I would strongly suggest that if you are contemplating purchasing this unit - DON'T DO IT. Yare in for nothing but headaches. the cost of the dispenser assembly along is nearly $300 and at least another $100 for the plumber to install it. Can't believe they can still sell these with the poor customer service offered and the lousy product. Would like to rate it a ""-1*"""
3,Good Dispenser - expensive,"This was a replacement for our dispenser that went out right at the 5yr limit of the waranty. Overall we greatly enjoy the luxury of having hot and room temp filtered water ready at any time. This dispenser looks great and functions well. It's super easy to install once you've done it the first time. I had expected an appliance like this to have at least a 10 year life, but the hot water heater only lasted 3 years and the dispenser 5 years. For the price I expected better quality and a longer life for both. Unfortunately they don't have much competition in this area."
4,"Wow, what lousy reviews!",We have been using it for over 5 years without issue. Want another for a new house.I cannot believe the horrible reviews for this simple appliance. I am wondering about alternatives. Maybe something has changed?
1,Horrible reliability,"We purchased and installed one of these along with the under-sink water heater tank 5 years ago. We've already had to replace the heater tank once (cracked inside), and the faucet fixture twice! With the fixture, both times it wouldn't shut off - the hot and cold levers just flap in the open position. As another posting says, the service people can't just replace an internal part... I have to buy a whole new unit each time this happens."
1,poor design (update),I've owned this faucet for nearly 4 years and for the past year is has been spradically broken. The hot water won't shut off. Insinkerator says that you cannot replace any parts within the faucet and you need to replace the faucet. Since Insinkerator wouldn't repair the faucet I took the unit apart and determined that the spring under the valve was weakened from corrosion. I emailed Insinkerator about getting a new spring. They autoreplied that someone would contact me. That was about 5 weeks ago. The faucet works now that I cleaned all of the deposits off the valve and spring. Now the tank only heats when it feels like it and now trips the breaker. Both the faucet and the company suck!
1,Tank leaks and valve sticks,"I don't usually write reviews. I'm one of those guys who reads the reviews but doesn't contribute too much. But I think this is such a !$#%@#$% product that I just have to chime in.All the other reviews are right on the mark: the tank will leak and the valve will stick open. If you're ""lucky"" like I was, the tank will leak under warranty and get replaced the first time. The second time it leaks, it will likely no longer be under warranty - like mine. The cold water valve will eventually stick in the open position and because it's not serviceable, there's nothing you can but spend more money.You couldn't pay me to install another one of these."
2,Valve stuck open,"Follow ""By R. Mac"" instructions and will it loosen the value. I open the other valve to see how it was suppose to function. I sprayed both valves with WD40 morning and night. Mine took approximate four days. GOOD LUCK!!."
4,Great for the curious!,"MESSAGES is a good introductory book for those not familiar with the study of human behavior. It was very easy to read and touched on many different aspects of human behavior. However, the book did not give many specifics and the examples did not go into great detail. Excellent for those wanting to learn a little more about human behavior."
2,Many functions BUT needs couple more!,"Was very easy to program, Learn function worked with my Hyundai LCD TV.A code for this tv could not be found! Now have 5 components programed and works great. Problem: Batt's dead in couple weeks, Dim function to conserve batt's does not work! Turning light off makes it hard to use.The vibration switch turning lights on is much too sensitive, turns on if someone moves in room or loud noise from tv! sensitivity is NOT adjustable. Adjusting time it is lit to go off sooner is a problem when you are using it, light keeps going off when you are looking for a button!SOMEWHAT DISAPOINTED!"
1,Waste of money.,"Yes, it was inexpensive. Yes, it had many features and was easy to program and use. Yes, the display looked very cool. And in less than four weeks of use the remote's backlight quit working. Two weeks later the thing was dead in the water despite fresh batteries.I threw it away and bought a cheap 4-in-1 from Walmart for $8. It's still working fine six months later."
2,Very poor usability,"This remote is very flashy, but I found it actually far worse than using multiple remotes. First of all, I hated the touch of the remote. The surface is completely flat, with hidden membrane buttons arranged under it. The feel was cheap.Second, the programmability wasn't all I wanted. The set of buttons on the remote available for use with, for example, a DVR are pre-configured. Sure, you can re-learn any button that's lit up, but half the buttons aren't in DVR mode and that's just your hard luck. So I had to program TiVo buttons in a number of locations that were both hard to reach and made no sense, even though there were better-labeled buttons in better places. They weren't associated with the DVR button, so I lose.Finally, the motion sensor is totally useless, as noted. One moment, it's turning on with absolutely no detectable reason; the next, I'm shaking it and it's not turning on.Not worth it. I returned it and am glad I did."
1,easy set up,"Nothing could be easier to set up than this remote and very easy to operate.Support is there with a phone call for missing codes, fully programmable and a learning remote as well. My main beef is this thing is a pig on batteries!Hyper sensitive for example while watching a movie the remote well turn on from the vibrations of the sub woofers and the remote is sitting on a pillow. If the remote is on a coffee table any one walks into the room the remote will turn on. While it is only on for 10 secs. it still is on and off constantly. Sent an e-mail to Universal Electronics on a way to reduce the sensitivity but received no responce, which I translate to meaning ""not possible"" Buyer beware and perhaps wait for the next model and perhaps this problem will be corrected."
3,Battery Hog,This remote is very cool and works on everything I have needed it to. It lives up to it's advertisement. But I have to replace the batteries once a month. VERY anoying!
2,Devours batteries!,"I thought this was going to be an awesome remote for a few reasons:*Illuminated remote for dark situations.*Controls multiple devices including my ReplayTV.*Easily updated device codes for future expandibilty.*Cool design, good looks and nice feel.BUT...it has some huge flaws:*Eats batteries - no joke!*Turns on and off constantly - just by entering the room!*No adjustment for keypad sensitivity or remote on/off.I like the idea of this remote, but it does not live up to my expectations."
5,Love this stuff,I just love this Chili Peppers Hot Salt. Its the best on EVERYTHING. I can't get enough of it. I wish I can have barrels of it on hand so I don't run out
4,Overall pretty spiff,I just randomly picked this up yesterday used... and was suprised.. it's pretty nice! nothing on it I didn't like... no weak points.. i didn't hear anything different in the Chem mix from the normal version... but overall a very good cd worth checking out..
4,Just a great compilation.,One of my favorites of the last 2 years. Great remix Numb(U2). Special attention to:Wild Wood (11) and Cry (12). Next step would be all Ministry of Sound compilations.
3,Kung fu buff,"Lots of good fighting but weak plot. A man who is always trying to better him-self and his kung-fu. Seems like he's going to be unbeatable, knows many different styles, but when he faces off with a Shaolin monk, he knows the meaning of defeat. He then wants to join the temple, but not for all the right reasons, but for vengences."
5,For your HBI collection,"First of all, this title rocks! All 5 girls featured here are gorgeous, specially Mary Carey which is my favorite. Picture quality is superb, the girls show it all for a good amount of time (12 min avg) and this title is more explicit than the average HBI, it shows some finger insertion in all 5 featurettes while the girls are playing with themselves. The music is nice and relaxing.As for the extras, are the usual for HBI, 10 previews from other titles, model profile, scene access.Recommended!"
4,Muscular,"I really like this music. I'm usually more about hip-hop but I'm really getting into this girl's words! ""Poets on Parade"" doesn't know it but is a righteous rap. ""The Hero of the World"" made me listen and sway. Producer Ben Rubin puts it all in a lovely world. I'd like to hear ""Blown"" remixed with a bit more drive, it could be even sexier. The girl Marilyn Carino sings like the open ocean - check out ""Pray"" and try not to shiver."
1,Common sense is right,"The title doesn't lie--the sense in this book is so common that it's boring. Read KISS MY TIARA instead. It's smarter and funnier. This book probably wouldn't have had a chance if PROZAC NATION hadn't been so popular. I don't know why Wurtzel is trying to appeal to the masses. She should stick to her usual audience--readers who gobble up her solipsistic, smarmy ramblings."
2,"Ok, i guess",This gun is good for its price but sometimes the balls dont shoot right. you cant shoot something right below you because the balls just fall out of the barrel! it also shoots multiple balls at once which really wastes them.
5,The Bodyguard's Story,This book gave me insight into the lives and hassles of the very famous AND those few people trusted to protect them. I enjoyed it immensely.
1,Just Awful! Save your cash!,"This is one of the MOST poorly written books I've ever read. I bought it at the dollar store and paid too much. Really. The author is pitiful, I've seen third graders turn out better prose. And Trevor? True, he's been through a lot, but does anyone, outside his family, truly care? Save your money."
2,HP SHOULD HAVE LEFT WELL ENOUGH ALONE,"I JUST COMPARED A PHOTO FROM THE PREVIOUS PREMIUM PAPER TO THE CURRENT SELECTION HP OFFERS. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! HOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE NO PREVIOUS PRINTED PHOTOS TO COMPARE YOU WILL BE SATISFIED WITH THE NEW HP QUALITY. HOW UNFORTUNATE THAT QUALITY CAN SLOWLY SLIP AWAY AND STILL BE WELL ACCEPTED."
5,HP Photo Paper,Received on time and in good condition. Great photo paper for our HP Photosmart Printer. Excellent copy and the Resolutions do not fade or smear.
5,Great For Young Boys,"I have a son of my own, and he loved this book. We had a ""deep"" conversation about the book. Those parents out there with boys, I reccommend this book to them and you."
5,building a bridge...,Fassbinder's unique adaptation of the fleisser story is something of a bridge in his career as a film director.. You can see elements of his previous movies in 'Pioneers ingolstadt' but you can also see that it looks forward to his later melodramas.. The unique camera work and lighting (pre michael balhaus) highlight the sexual frustrations and the battles that are being waged in this town.. Fassbinder creates a mood that lasts the whole movie.. The movie once again adresses the impossibility of love... and it shows how you can use the needs of other people as a weapon against them.. It is not Fassbinder's easiest work - but one of his most important..
3,convience,"when i first got this it worked great after awhile it started to have issues, like the mouce came apart on the inside and when i investigated the problem i found the small ball bearings out of place, inspected further and disovered that the plastic that kept the bearings in place were broke. also now the connection between the board and usb pice tend to have issues, like having to resync, and not very accurite with any objects in the line of sight."
2,I'm rather surprised by these reviews,"Pros: PriceCons: too small, drops keystrokes, trackball is jumpy.No idea how this is one of the best reviewed keyboards on Amazon. Frankly, I found it to be ust barely adequate, and can't wait to stop usng it. I'm typing my review on it, in fact, and I won't be fixing any typos. It fits well in your lap, if that's your only criteria, and it does work -- but it starts to drop letters and other keystrokes pretty fast if you start typing too quickly, or begin hitting keys too hard (which is odd, you'd think that banging away on the keys would make it more responsive, not less responsive).In a last act of contrariness, it is performing nearly flawlessly while I type this review.Go figure."
3,cant beat a wired keyboard,"this keyboard seemed to be a just what the doctor ordered, but after a couple of weeks, it just sickens me. granted when it does work it works just as good as any wired keyboard...though there are times that the trackball is unresponsive and the keys don't register. i chose this keyboard because it had the most positive reviews out of all my other choices. i will eventually go back to my wired keyboard just as soon as i get frustrated enough to smash this one.for anyone interested in buying this item: setup was a breeze, worked with vista, multimedia buttons worked better than qwerty keys,"
4,Devi was nuts but wrote some good stuff and lived an interesting life,"Devi was more or less completely insane, especially her wacky ideas about Hitler being an incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu but if your smart enough to weed out the psychosis she did write some good stuff. Her anti-monotheism, ecological and animal rights stuff in particular is very good.So much about her reflects how nutty and contradictry she was. For example she was obsessed with Nazism and Aryan racial purity but she married a man of Indian ancestry. She had a genius level IQ and a phd in a hard science but had her strange ideas about Hitler being a Hindu God. This book is worth reading because, whether you like her or not, she did live an interesting life. For what it was worth at least she was an original thinker."
5,Good cover,"Good cover, fits nice.. Has a zippered pocket to keep extra items might need for generator(oil, tools, etc. )"
2,"wall hanging, not a flag","printed on one side only, cheap stitching on the edges. I guess for the price you can't expect more, but this flag had to have been made north of Mason-Dixon"
2,Not a lot of heat for so much electricity,"It's decorating a garage shelf now. Raised electric bill by $40,00 but didn't raise the room temp at all."
3,Fair,"I found this product fair. The pro side is, a comfortable fit and compact size with fair to good sound quality. The con side is, there's no volume or mute control on the cord itself and the earlobe clip fits a bit loose."
4,Attention Xbox users.,I bought this for my xbox 360. It works great in fact I still use it today. The only problem is that my friends always say its too quiet. I rated this four stars because of the price and because I don't know how well this works with cell phones. Oh and back when i bought it it was only like .99 so i suggest another headset.
5,"Good, inexpensive headset",This headset is lightweight and stays on well even when wearing a hat or sunglasses. The sound is good and doesn't have the echo-y sound of some other headsets I've tried.
1,Poor design.....wont stay in ear,"I bought these based on the reviews on here and am unhappy with them after only one day of use. I bought two sets, one for my boyfriend and one for me. He says he had great difficulty hearing me although I heard him clearer then ever before. Both of our main problems were that it just wouldnt stay in our ear. I believe changeable ear gels would be a help as the foam does nothing over the earpieve. The clip thing also is pretty useless. I replaced a jabra earwave boom with these which I liked but it gave out on me after a few months. I think I will be buying 2 more again."
3,Good but not great,"The ear piece works fine, and I believe, from what people on the other end of the line have told me, it does screen out background noise well - for them - but the volume on my side is not that high so sometimes it's difficult to hear what people are saying. It's pretty good quality overall and the little clip attached makes storing the ear piece handier because you can just wrap up the cord and hold it together with the clip that's supposed to be used to attach the cord to your clothes."
3,Nor satisfied or dissatisfied,"Prons :- Solved by basic necessity.Cons :- Volume can not be adjusted, Sometimes for end person voice is not clearly audible"
2,Doesn't work with my Phone,"I bought this because of the other reviews and the price but it does not work with my phone. I tried to check with the manufacturer of my phone before buying this product, but no specific information was given since it's an older phone (about a year and a half old). When I attach the earpiece my phone says ""Enhancement not Supported."" I have a Nokia 6030. I will hold onto the earpiece in hopes that it will work with a future phone of mine!"
3,Plantronics MX150,The Platronics MX150 Flexible Boom Headset is small and compact. It works fine except it does not have the button to answer your call like another headset I have does. It is somewhat convenient to use and you don't have to speak really loud like the ones that are not booms since the microphone is closer to your mouth.
2,Broken After A Few Months' Light Use,"I'd had one of these in the past which lasted me about five years. This one lasted a couple months of occasional use and died entirely, mid-conversation. I hope the second one I bought and stashed in the car for emergencies comes through should I ever need it.(Additionally, the seller from whom I purchased it here on Amazon failed to include the soft ear-fuzzies. Much less comfortable.)"
2,"Great, but what happened?","Ok, so I ordered one product, a plantronic's headset. I got one that looked like it, but somehow it's not in the packaging pictured, and it says Verizon on it.It still works, so I am happy enough, but I'm wondering if I did get that ""new"" item, or someone's returned product.I emailed the company, no response."
3,Depends on whether it works.,"I have had three of these ear pieces. It fits my ear well, is comfortable for long conversations (up to an hour or two), and stays put on my ear without hassle.The first one I had worked excellently for years before I got rid of it when I got rid of my cell phone. When I got a cell phone again, I knew exactly what I wanted. The second was just as great as the first, but unfortunately was stolen.The third didn't work. Booo. I could hear the person on the other end of the phone, but they could not hear me. I tried it on several different phones with the same result. Didn't work.I returned the ear piece and the seller was prompt and courteous. Too bad I got a defective item. But I guess that's how it goes with consumer electronics. I wouldn't let it stop me from ordering this again, though. Just make sure you get it from a decent seller who will accept a return if it doesn't work."
2,Disappointed,"I use several Plantronics products, this was the first big disappointment. The audio quality is not great. It does not offer loud enough volume in the earpiece. I find myself pushing the earpiece into my ear to attempt to hear the other person on the line. Completely defeating the purpose of hands-free. Will look for a better quality product."
4,Plantonics Head set,"Plantonics MX150 Flexible Boom Head Set with 2.5 mm plug.I like the product alot! Nothing over head, just a ""ear plug"" i call it! Alot more comfortable than over the head headset and extremely clear! I have both but prefer the ""ear plug"" best!"
1,Don't buy this!,I don't believe this is a real Plantronics brand headset. The headset came in a little plastic bag with a sticker that said Plantronics and the sticker was poorly made. On top of that the headset didn't work very well at all.
3,"Easy For People to Hear, but Uncomfortable to Wear","Overall, it's a great headset for the price. Pretty amazing actually. You'll need to get a wired converter to convert the 2.5mm to 3.5mm like this one:Headset Adapter 3.5mm to 2.5mm Audio Adapter and Converter (Black) - Non-Retail Packaging. No biggie.But the curved rubber piece is really stiff and hurts my ear after about 30 minutes or less. Sometimes quite painfully.I have a dull voice and this is by far the best headset I have that helps people hear me clearly (I actually have an older version of the same headset, so I have two). No one complains they can't hear me or do they need to turn up their volume. Noise cancellation is also pretty good. Not as good as my cheap jawbone, but then people usually complain they can't hear me as well on that one. So, stay away from this if you plan to talk on the phone a while or have larger ears. Small ears may work just fine. Mine are probably about average for males. Otherwise, worth the price."
5,"Love this boom style, fits LG Verizon Phone","This little design that hooks into the ear is easy on, easy off. Not annoying or uncomfortable or unstable like the ones that hook over the ear. The only thing that would make this gadget even better would be extra foam pads. They are ridiculously hard to find and overpriced when you do find replacement pads for the ear buds."
1,Crap.,"Man when this got here i was thinking it's gonna be awesome but hen it keeps unplugging itself and the volume is all the way up and i still can't here anyone. It's not even planatronics they gave me some cheap verizon one.It looks like it has PTT, yes i'm trying to get it to work with walkie talkie. This is crap don't get it for walkie talkie!"
2,Difficult to hear,"I own both a Motorola T730 and a LG VX4500 and have used the MX150 with both phones. Used in conjunction with the Motorola it is basically worthless due to low volume. It is slightly better when used with the LG, which seems to have better amplification on the handset when compared to the Motorola, but I still don't feel it is an ideal solution."
1,TERRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL SOUND QUALITY,"You'll think you were going DEAF using this piece of garbage. It falls out of my ear every time I sneeze, and the sound quality is absolutely APPALLINGLY AWFUL. I would recommend buying this if you want to torment yourself. If you're that anxious to throw away your money, I'll be happy to take it, and give you nothing in return. You can thank me later."
5,Perfect,"Hey. This is a perfect little headset. I've had it for a year now. People can't tell I'm on a cell phone. Excellent at blocking outside noise, and I can hear everything crystal clear on the receiving end. Great Buy."
3,Two of two have broken,"PROSGood sound.Good fit for me.Good volume according to those I've spoken to.CONSBoth MX-150s I've owned have had their microphones stop working suddenly, the most recent one after a few weeks of use.I used these two MX-150s daily in my home office.I upgraded to an MX-505 that includes inline mute and volume controls. I hope it lasts for years."
5,Works Really Well,Works really well. Have had a lot of trouble with Bluetooth devices so I picked up a few of these old-school wired devices. People hear me clearly and I hear them clearly as well. And the price is right. I use it on an LG flip phone--not sure the jack size fits smart phones.
1,DOES NOT WORK,don't waste your money and time. just received the product tried with multiple compatible phones and it didn't work with any of them. the product is defective that's why it's so cheap listen to the negative reviews.
3,Does not work with HTC or Motorola,"This looked like a great headset, until I tried it. I first tried it with my Motorola SLVR L7. Of course, I had to get the adapter and it didn't work. I could not figure out whether it was the adapter or the headset, so it just sat in my drawer for months. Just recently, I bought an HTC EVO which also needed an adapter (2.5 to 3.5). I could hear out of it but the microphone didn't work. I then plugged this in to an iPhone and it worked fine. So, I'm not really sure how to rate this, as it may be fine for most phones, but for some reason it does not work with 2 out of 2 of my Sprint phones. I'm really dissappointed as there is a huge lack of wired over-the ear headsets!"
2,Too small for my head,It works fine but be advised this headset might too small for some people. The mic can barely reach my mouth.
3,Should not be sold for use with smart phones,"Plantronics is a good reliable supplier of headsets. I purchased this headset with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm converter assuming that it would work with my LG Optimus V Android mobile. Sadly the microphone does not work with my device. Also the maximum audio volume is only fair, difficult to hear on a very busy sidewalk. A positive is the earlobe rubberized clamp, very comfortable and great for eyeglass wearers. I'm not complaining, the device was <$5.00. If I can find the same Plantronics style with a 3.5mm plug I'll buy it. Lesson learned."
2,"Agree, volume too low","I bought 2 headsets at once, this and the MX505. Cross-testing this against the 505 on both a cell phone and a cordless, I continually get complaints that the MX150 is too quiet. It's a shame because the headset is very comfortable. Considering the $5 difference in price, the MX505 is much nicer (comes with 2 different booms and spare foam). Not to be a total downer, but the range of motion on the MX150 boom is too limited and the entire piece moves out of position too easily."
1,Not as pictured,"The earpiece is stamped ""Verizon"" and is of different finish than pictured. There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed, ""ACCSTOP"" in Oxnard, CA. For $2.47, I guess it doesn't matter but still, not the item pictured. It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new.Cannot try it as the 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase."
2,Poor use of funds...,"That is what I would call it from a business standpoint. It stopped working for me within about 2 months and when I called the company to complain and they informed me that they would not replace it unless I had my receipt and when I told them I didn't keep my receipt the young women told me to give her the ""date-code"" on the headset and when I gave that to her she told me that it didn't compute. So therefore I would have to pay to replace it. I think that any ""decent"" company would have taken care of a customer in order to keep them happy. I would recommend something besides Plantronics. Good luck and God Bless."
1,sucks,"Im quite irritated! I ordered this product about a month ago.......didnt get it, wrote a not so great review. Got a call from these ppl they said if i removed my comment they would send me a new one for free. So i did.....still dont have the product and i still didnt get my money back!!! All i have to say is RIP OFF!!!!!!"
4,Love this,"I just used the therm for the first time today, all I can say is wow, this does exactly what I want. Would have been 5 stars if it had a ON /OFF switch. You have to pull the batter. No that big of a deal no tools required. Rock solid function good UI. Only had to consult the directions when I could nto find the ON Off Switch, and they said it did not have one."
3,"Nice form factor, temperature seems a bit off.","Length:: 0:33 MinsI like this thermometer, but the temperature doesn't seem to be super accurate. The thermometer reads 98C in boiling water, and below range (of 0C) for ice water. It is a very simple setup with current temperature, desired temperature and a timer. However, an error of 1-2C is not acceptable for some of the exact sous vide style cooking I was planning with this."
2,Probe is very easily broken!,"The good aspects of this thermometer are that you can attach it (by magnet) to your stove front and that you can set your target temperature and have it beep to tell you you've reached it. Of course, this is what you want in a digital thermometer.Two problems: one is that you can't ever turn it off (unless you want to take out the battery), and so it's unnecessarily using the battery; the second is that the probe is EXTREMELY sensitive. I'm on my third probe in a few months. Do NOT use with the GRILL except to check the temperature and then take it out. You can not use it with the grill lid closed. I did not see this in the instructions anywhere. My second broke inexplicably. You'll know it's broken when the temperature will read only LOW or HIGH.I have to get replacement probes (for $10) via mail because no local stores carry them.So just know you must treat the probe with kid gloves and you'll be OK."
2,didn't last long,"I still have yet to find one that does. the probe started to show signs of stress where the wire connects almost in the first week. I first noticed it becoming brittle, and then after about a month it completely broke. The digital unit works great, but I can't see myself spending money on another probe which is not that cheap. I just went with a simple stick style and use this as the timer."
2,Didn't Give Me Accurate Results a Few Times,"I always use thermometers for roasting beef or poultry to check for ""doneness"". Before purchasing this product, I had a Martha Stewart digital thermometer that I used over 50 times until the metal probe broke and it worked every single time without issues. I tried this product a few times with a Chicken and a beef roast, and it would give me consistent lower readings, causing me to under cook my meal."
4,"Very nice, but a little too narrow","After many years, my older version of this same device failed. I picked this up to replace it, and it's still a great device. However, this one is a bit narrower, and the buttons a bit smaller, which makes it a little harder to use. Not a big deal, but if you have pudgy little fingers like mine, it can be annoying at times.Overall a very nice timer/thermometer, and the new rubber-like sheath (I assume silicone) around the thermometer cord is nice for keeping everything dry in soups and stews. The clip that comes with it is a little too stiff, but I can fix that over time."
1,Much Worse than Taylor Thermomenter,"I have used digital thermometers in the past and the probe usually fails after a year or two of use (displays LO when plugged in). Since the probe cord is thicker on this unit, my thinking was that it might last longer. Unfortunately, it lasted only 1.5 months. do not waster your money on this product."
5,Handy!,"Easy to use, accurate. I like that the magnetized bottom sticks to the stove top so the display stays in place when you open the oven. Other reviewers noted a lack of an on/off button, but this has been addressed; my recently purchased unit has an on/ off switch on the bottom. I am very pleased with it."
4,Good thermometer/timer,My only complaint is that the off switch is on the bottom so you have to pick it up and flip it over to turn it on or off. Not always easy to do when you hands are covered in food.
3,thermometer,i purchased this based on cooks illustrated review. i have to say its not much better than the lowest rated probe thermometer.
5,Perfect!,It is easy and it does what it claims to do. Preserves those partially open bottles of wine for the next time you need it. Creates a good vacuum in the bottle. You can also purchase additional stoppers. Highly recommend.
4,Whimsical documentary about a Matchmaker,"Off-beat documentary about an aging US rancher who discovers his real professional passion -- playing matchmaker between lovelorn US men and willing Mexican women. Approach this with an open mind and you'll enjoy this genteel story -- approach it with pre-conceived notions of gender equality, border issues, etc., and you'll head into emotional upsets."
4,Required viewing for all true American Patriots!,"Watching this DVD brought back memories of ""Duck and Cover"" drills of my childhood. Some of the films are quaint, some charming, some funny. A few are scary...especially ""Despotism"", made in 1945, at the end of WW2. This 10 minute film systematically compares the characteristics of a free, democratic society, with those of a police state. Watching it now, in the era of the Patriot Act, etc. made me shiver with how chillingly close the USA is coming to this film's description of despotism. It must be seen to be believed!"
5,Gifts,"were gifts to friends and family members..waiting for their conmentsIn the past,have read or heard about life after death..."
4,Enlighting,Enjoyed reading this book very much. I've read a lot of other books about heavenand this one is more informative and enjoyable than others.
3,"I wanted to like it, but...","After reading other users' reviews and WND promotion, I was looking forward to an exciting, uplifting story about the U.S. With a few exceptions (ACLU and PP backgrounders), the presentation was tedious and the storyline disjointed. Example: a short segment on the Crusades; now let's talk about Christopher Columbus. Five minutes later you learn the connection. Now let's talk about something else! The quotations selected from our founding fathers are appropriate, but their vocabularly and writing style---while more advanced than most people's today---get in the way of the points being made.Maybe it gets better towards the end. I started to fall asleep around 1920, so have not finished the DVD. Sorry. I wanted to like it but..."
4,A nice gadget,"It does what it says, it peels garlic and very well. It can also chop small vegetables. The blade is very sharp, but small and weak, be careful when loading the chopper."
1,Expensive mistake - Bob's Red Mill Roasted Oregon Hazelnuts,Bob's Red Mill Roasted Oregon Hazelnuts tasted stale and over cooked. This is not a quality product and not good value for the money. Don't waste your money on this item.
1,Wabbles,This is junk. One would expect a router stand to not move when your gingerly trying to make router cuts. This one does. I had to push it against a wall to steady it even after mounting 3/4 inch plywood on the top and the bottom.Don't waste your money.
5,NASCAR done right!,"I played last years version and was pleased with the progress it was making. This year its 2002 version times 10!Pros: 1. NASCAR is better than ever!2. last years tweaks are fixed3. an improvement in graphics4. outstanding career mode5. so many modes, that it will keep you busy for months!6. the ability to import songs is availableCons: 1. physics take some time to get used to2. first years of career mode are frustrating due to crapiness of car and crewFinal Verdict: A definite buy! as i said earlier, it will keep you busy for months"
1,Avoid this spout,"This spout is awful, I used it exactly twice before it broke apart trying to get it unstuck from my Subaru. I was lucky the tank wasn't full otherwise I wouldn't have been able to stop the flow of gas."
2,Horrible spout - dangerous,"The only reason I am not giving one star is that I assume some machinery will push the spring loaded spout back correctly. However, when putting in my generator, it does not. I am left trying to pour and also pull back on the spout. I am trying to keep it in the mouth while pulling back -- unless you have amazing skill you are going to spill -- fire hazard. AVOID unless you are sure the usage you have will automatically push it back."
3,missing something,"This covers every possible aspect of bridge building that a layperson could think of. Except for one thing. It hardly mentions the laborers who are responsible for the work that made these bridges possible. Yes, a bridge is made from concrete, brick, steel, timber, cable, iron, and whatnot, but what about the blood, sweat, and tears? The book goes into the construction of piers, the methods used to erect various parts of the bridge, and so forth. But it stops short of mentioning how the laborers were organized, who they were, where they came from, and how many of them died building these works of art.So, although the book filled me with knowledge, I finished it feeling a little bit empty, as if I had seen the surface of all the seas and oceans of the world, but never a whale or fish."
4,good notebook,I bought these for use at work and to use as a food journal. The smaller size makes them very portable and easy to use.
1,Very poor remastering!,These cuts sound like re-recordings of 78's. I love Bix. There is no one better. To think that his recordings sounded so good with the limited technology of the time. I have Columbia 33 rpm Bix LP's from the 60's that have more clarity and less noise than these CD's. Even though I've allmost worn them out they still sound much much better than these offerings.I bought these CD's for 20 bucks at Tower records and I will never listen to them again.I give a Trillion-Billion stars to Bix's playing but this reissue's quality deserves none.But ...hey! Bix Lives!!!!!
5,The Roar of Thunder,"I've always been a huge fan of racing,but being able to control thecars is a lot better.Not only can you control the cars,you can makethem!It's got all the drivers like Jeff Gordon,Bobby Labonte,Ward Burton,etc.Don't waste your time renting it,buy it,now!!!It's worth every penny."
1,Out of date,"This books is too old to be relevant anymore. The information is out of date, and nearly all the Web sites referenced are no longer around. There are plenty of other great auction books to read."
1,****DISAPOINTED********,"If you enjoy nascar or real driving games you will not like this game. If you know how to set up a car for racing you be very limited and if you never have set up a car before you will be lost and sent in the wrong direction. EAS has only added a few new tricks here and there. Overall I would be upset if I was Dale Jr.,Mike Helton, Bill France, or anybody associated with EAS for releasing this version of this game. This game is an updated version of pole position right down to when the car catches on fire. If your really want this game wait [till the price goes down]."
1,Utter naivety,The arguments proposed in the book are extremely outlandish. The book appears to be a collection of impulsively driven notions without any attempts to verify their credibility. The vagueness about his reasoning becomes evidently clear. It seems that the author attempts to gain cheap publicity and fame by exploiting the reader's tendency towards sensationalism. One star rating is the minimum that I am allowed in this review.
3,Davis at her freakiest.,"Bug-eyed Bette behaves worse than you can possibly imagine, shocking even us jaded modern viewers, wreaking havoc on her fallen southern family, doing what she does best and completely incorrigible. John Huston adds his dramatic noirish surface-to-air camera angles, and the melodramatic soundtrack music literally never stops. Who knows why the doomed doctor would run away with this psychotic (and in my opinion, unattractive) twisted sister, forsaking Olivia de Havilland? Then again, who cares? We watch gleefully as tragedy mounts upon tragedy and Davis shamelessly skirts her own repulsive behavior with a delightfully hideous lack of humanity. The movie is also interesting for a characterization of a young black man that is refreshingly deep for its time and less patronizing than you might expect. Probably John Huston was behind that. Definitely a satisfying diversion."
3,I really had hoped for more,"While this has some nice drawings in it which are a bit easier to see/understand compared to some of the online resources out there. I really had hoped for more, the entirety of the actual coverage of technique is about 2 paragraphs. The rest is the same technical details everyone else covers in practically the same language.This also suffers from the same problem as the couple of the vintage works I have, the coverage of circular saw blades. I'm sure there are people out there who find this interesting, I find it gets in the way. I would like more indepth coverage of different techniques for different effects than coverage for steel circular saw blades. Different fleam, tooth angles and angle that defines the gullet all affect the wood differently and work well for various woods and situations.You wouldn't know that if you read this.This is a mediocre introduction to saw filing. It, however, is not all that people make it out to be."
2,"kind of works, but not well enough to purchase","The treads on most shoes/boots go from left-to-right across the sole. This product only allows one to swipe the shoe front-to-back, with no side-to-side option. Therefore, the product only gets some of the dirt, etc, off your shoe (maybe half). You still have to find something else to scrape your shoe sideways across. To conclude, this device does not work very well, and I would pick something else if I could do it over again."
3,"Reckless observations of a postmodern girl, indeed!","Aisha's Swerve is a cornucopia of advice for with-it women, women who ascribe to be more liberated and self-empowered. Swerve is also a book chock-full of Ms. Tyler's random thoughts about everything from beer, one-night stands, music videos, The View, marriage, strippers, to so much more.Aisha's got a big mouth and a wicked sense of humor and is unafraid to use either. I liked that. She's sassy (a word she abhors in a chapter dubbed ""The Uppity Bitch Paradox,"" but it fits), intelligent (she has a government degree from Dartmouth, for God's sake) and able to debate about any subject (and she will). Her ranting is all about women taking charge of their lives and not being objectified by society's standards of beauty or sex.Aisha's observations aren't all that reckless - just down-to-earth, honest sentiments from a woman who's not afraid to be herself...which is what she wants every woman to be.So go on! Get your Swerve on!"
5,Wat cha workin wit....,"Well I will tell you that Ms. Whitaker is working with real talent. The first book, Flip Side of the Game was a great read, but this book is a testimony to the coming out of a great author. This book, is the dessert that you will never forget, the added touch. I truly enoyed this book. The sub characters were developed and took on a life of their own. This book is a fantastic follow-up. I laughed so hard and cried as well. I would suggest that you read both books together, for the full effect. It seems like the characters just came alive. I enjoyed reading and this book just reaffirmed why I love books. Go ahead and get your read on with Vera, Taj, Aunt Cookie,Uncle Boy, Rowanda and the girlfriends. This book is destined to be a movie. Spike Lee and Queen Latifa, needs to jump on the rights to this story, RIGHT NOW!"
5,Praise for all Diva's,Game Over is a wonderful book that kept me on the edge of my sit.The action started on the very first page and continued to the end. I am waiting for Tu-Shonda to release another book soonThis book has the makings of a made for television movie.God bless.Madame CJ Walker
2,Empty eerie,"It is a shame I can consciously hear myself rooting out any musical qualities (in other words, the small, actually composed aspects which remind of Godspeed) in these pretentious, depressive drones. Although they do create and sustain some uncomfortably bleak moods, especially on the longer pieces, many of these heavily sampled, anti-musical soundscapes sound like nothing rather then articulate nothingness. A primal metallic screeching and swelling works when locked in its rhythmic death-grip ala related projects Hangedup but comes up vacant when solely making sonic statements."
4,Gargan steals the show!!,"For me Laughton falls a bit short, his Italian accent pretty labored. And he just doesn't capture the Italian ebullience. But still, he's always interesting. Lombarde gets to grit her teeth and agonize. She's fine, but I'd prefer her in something meatier, or funnier. But Gargan here is the truest character....the one willing to alter his previous character. I had seen him in mostly small roles. So to find him so full of fire in a major role was a total surprise.For a more interesting pairing of Laughton & Lombard see ""White Woman."" A very hard hitting version of middle aged guy and young gal."
5,Great Price and Works Great,I shopped for a second remote and this was the best price I could get one for and it works great and is worth the money :)
5,Good,"Has space for large pen, plus space for smaller pencils and drawers.A little bit big overall, but it's design and functionality worth it!"
4,"Perfect, simple, no-nonsense fan","This is a really well-made and nice looking product for under $15. It's a fairly lage fan with a lot of power -- I find the lowest setting to be enough for me, most of the time. It's not overly noisy (though it is a fan, so you will get some noise) and it's well-constructed.My only beef is that the power cord is a little too short (maybe 3 1/2 feet?). I had to use an extension cord, but that's not really a big deal."
4,Very quiet and stable table fan,"It is a well made table fan, that I use in the bedroom on hot summer nights. It keeps me comfortable and works very quietly; no hums or rattles to keep me awake.I got it from Amazon as the free ship offer made it very interesting."
4,Great set for the price,Very easy to clean in the dishwasher or handwash.This is the second time I buy it and I love it.
2,all the buttons dont work,"unhappy with, all the buttons doesnt work, but of course my son totally destroyed the package so can't return, :("
3,Good Wireless Control,"this control works with all my games, and is a nice size in comparison with my hands. It is comfortable but, it dosent have any vibration."
4,Great game,What more could you ask then to be a speeder or a high speed cop.This is one you can't miss out on.They have the high speed cars you've been wanting.
4,Great NFS game,"Definintly as good as Underground, amzing cars with exellent speed, if I had to make one change to underground it would be to have different cars like Porsche, Lamborghini, Mercedes, BMW, etc. I would have the cars in this game in underground, amazing tracks (variety, the only thing is it can sometimes be boring after you are great at this game, overall an awesome game!"
4,Played out the bad way,This game was probably hot when it first came out but now it is all played out. NFS2 is okay the tracks are all just like boring it seems like after you've raced 4 you've raced them all. The game just switches them upside down in all kinds of directions. Besides that the games coolnes comes from the action being the cop and chasing the speeders and the two player mode is hot too. But this game does NOT compare to all the other great racing games that I've played the only reason I bought ut was because it was going to work with my racing wheel. Rent the game but don't this one. It surely is not worth it not worth it all.
1,AWFUL- almost painful,"If you value your eardrums: do not purchase this CD. This music is really horrid. My sweet child put his little hands over his ears and started to cry when I attempted to play it for him. I tried another song and he wailed. The lead singer's voice is just AWFUL, almost painfully NASAL. Not only do you want to give her a decongestant, but you also want to ask: why would you ever think you should sing anything, let alone children's music? The lyrics are just plain bad. It is really bad music, difficult to listen to. If I could give it no stars, I would, believe me. Don't waste your money on this. It seems pretty obvious that the reviews before this one were written by the band themselves. Sad."
5,Nice,Bought Persona 4 and didn't have a controller for my ps2 so i bought this and it works pefectly with no flaws. Also to mention it came in pretty quickly a lot quicker than I anticipated. :) 5 out 5!
4,Good product without even opening the package,"I've been buying game controllers and accessories for some time now, and without even having to open the package (which arrived within estimated delivery time), I could tell this product was clean and in working order. I'm glad I could get this present to a friend without having to worry about the quality of the product. Thanks for the service!"
3,Strong unpleasant smell,I used a very tiny amount by applying the product with a toothpick and to me it smelled like strong stale urine and lingered even though I scrubbed to get it off. I simply cannot tolerate this product. One girl that works for me seemed to become very affectionate for the six days that I used this product where she had never been before. Once I discontinued use her behavior seemed to return to normal. Therefore the claims made by Pherone may have merit. Packing was discrete and delivery was prompt.
1,A stinker,I have used this pheromone products and my sex life has not improved a bit...a complete waste of money and prestige...bad odors and an overall bad idea...
1,No Success!,I have worn this several times over the past year that I have owned it and I haven't had any success for myself. That doesn't mean no one else will though.
1,Not for young children,"I was extremely upset with this DVD. I plan to write to Sony & the producers of this show. I find it unnecessary for the writers to use the word ""jerk"" to describe unruly kids in school. That's all I need my 3 year old to start calling people. What is this world coming to that these writers feel the need to put such foul language in a children's movie. My children will never watch this movie again. I wouldn't recommend this unless you don't mind your kids using the word ""jerk"" It was used more than once."
3,critical thinking book,The book was more worn than the rating made it sound. It had lots of writing in it also.
3,Critical Thinking Review,"The book arrived just in time for my class! It is a great book, and works well with my classes. Although, I was disappointed in the shape of the product (it had torn and worn pages and was written and graphitti'd in); I did purchase it 'used', but the sellers comment said in good condition. I guess their definition of good and mine differ. But overall it was a good buy for the price."
4,Worth it for the price.,"I have played all the Hot Pursuits over the years, and this one was pretty good. One of the things I like about this series as opposed to other racing games is that you can also play as the cop.I also enjoy the fact that they do give you the option of choosing multiple paths to the end to try to cut off the competition.I think there are better, more robust racing games out there, but for the price I'd say that this one is worth the money."
4,It was better on the Play Station,"I gotta say that I was looking foward to this title, and I bought it as soon as I saw it on the shelf. My wife and I were big fans of the game for the PS1, so we expected this version for the Xbox to be updated with better graphics, cars and tracks.Nope.The graphics are terrible. It's hard to believe that Porsche Unleashed for my PC looks 100x better than this game, and the Xbox has a better graphics card inside it!The physics for the cars are awful, vehical damage has been scaled WAY back as well.The only thing I do like is the music. Can this be played as a CD?"
3,Overdone.,"I found this book unsatisfying. Maybe I just don't like the circuitous nature of English mysteries. Maybe I need more action and less talk. Fewer -- and more relevant --red herrings. And I resist the English mystery tradition of the know-it-all detective who, in Sherlock Holmes fashion, gathers people around him at the end and in great detail tells what went down and by whom. Whatever. I just found the book so-so."
1,"More fluff than substance - Green glass ""unknown mfg""","After absolutely loving Mauzy's Depression Glass book this one was such a huge disappointment. The pictures are huge, many 1/2 a page, which seems was done to make the book appear more meaty.Many of the green pieces are labeled as ""unknown manfacturers"", almost comical is a row of tumblers and sherbets (another row of vases) listed as ""various manufacturers"". That section of the book seems like they went to someone's house and just pictured each piece.The coverage of salt and pepper shakers is quite good, almost as if that is what the book really was before adding ""fluff"" items. Very little information (such as dates) is given, though.With the little information given, I just don't trust the prices as being any guideline whatsoever. Disappointed.Update: I found the prices listed are 5 to 10 times realistic pricing, even for the fanciest shops. Even more disappointed now, it has cost me money."
4,Serial Flasher,"FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (1940) was a 12-part sci-fi serial. Each episode ran somewhat under 20 minutes. Recurring cast members included Lee Powell, who was the screen's first Lone Ranger (also in a serial). This DVD contains the second half of the story.Episodes:#7 - Land of the Dead#8 - The Fiery Abyss#9 - The Pool of Peril#10 - The Death Mist#11 - Stark Treachery#12 - Doom of the DictatorActors:Buster Crabbe - Flash GordonCarol Hughes - Dale ArdenCharles Middleton - Emperor MingAnne Gwynne - SonjaFrank Shannon - Dr. ZarkovShirley Deane - Princess AuraLee Powell - Captain Roka"
2,No better than Hanon,"Surprise, surprise. Yet another list of chromatically ascending, single-line patterns, none of which are particularly musical, let alone jazzy. There is a suggestion in the introduction that these patterns might be played over a chord progression like that found in the bridge of Cherokee -- of course, bearing in mind that ""most of the patterns in this book will not fit the bridge to 'Cherokee'."" I wish he had included the suggested chord progressions as well as patterns. I doubt this book will be of much use to beginning students -- unless you work with a master teacher who can help you make musical sense of them."
4,practical read a book holder,"Walking on a treadmill: I needed something to hold a newspaper, magazine, or book to read while I walked my mile or so. This is handy; small enough to carry in my pocket, strong enough for a heavy book. FlipKlip is easy to use: turn a page and lift it under the rubberized clamps, and keep walking. Just great. Time flies when you're reading and walking that mile."
4,Is what it is,"This product works well. It does just what it says it will do on the label. While it works correctly, going to the next page is disruptive to the flow of a book. I ended up solving the problem of holding a book by ordering a Kindle reader. Yet, I am still glad to have the clip for those few situations where I can't get the read in Kindle format. I recommend this product and suggest you view the Kindle.Kindle: Amazon's Wireless Reading Device"
2,Disappointed,I was looking forward to using this product in the gym to hold my books while on the treadmill or eliptical machine but was dissapointed in it as it was not nearly strong enough to hold even a small book satisfactorily to be able to stand on a piece of gym equipment solidly.It was very difficult to turn the pages and in the end gave up after about 3 attempts as too frustrating to be worth it.The springs need to be much tighter to hold the book open but that in itself does cause more issues with the page turning.Maybe an OK product for holding open a recipe book or a book that you are only looking at one page for but most recipe books do tend to be larger and this product would not be able to manage that size or width of book.I would not recommend
2,Great but cheaply made,"I bought two of the klips about three months ago. I loved it. I use it to read while on the eliptical and it works fantastically. After two months however, the first one broke where the spring loaded arm meets the main unit. The second only lasted two weeks before breaking in the exact same place.I wish I knew of a different item to use for this purpose, but I have yet to find anything else. I wish it was better made. I will admit that I use mine everyday, and that might be more than it can handle."
1,does not work on the treadmill,"I was looking for a product to use while reading on my treadmill.This product is not made for that purpose and should not be advertised as a treadmill book holder but rather as just a ""book holder"". There is no way to clip it onto the treadmill so that it won't fall during a workout."
4,"Sit back, relax and enjoy!!!","Ms. Willman writes another wonderful romance. I usually prefer books where the main characters grow to love one another and avoid the ""misunderstanding"" storyline, but this story rises above that typical plot trap. It also avoids the black and white ""good guy/villian"" trap.Ms. Willman is a skillful writer who gets into the mind of our hero - who happens to be a painter - and you can actually see his thought processes. I found it interesting that this painter sees life in pictures, not necessarily words. Our heroine is a bit naive, but I suppose it fits the plot. The secondary characters are a delight and add so much to the story. Add in a dash of fairy dust and ""poof"" a geat read!My only criticism of this book is the compact amount of time in which the story unfolds. Everything happens in such a short period of time, I felt that it would be hard to get to know each other let alone fall in love. Other than that, Lost Bride is definitely worth reading."
5,I am so Gay!!!! And my name is James!!!!,"I remember the first time I listened to this album. It was with my boyfriend Peter-Peter-Pillow Eater. We were parked in his red VW Jetta sitting atop a hill looking at the stars listening to Jawbreaker. We started to make out and funny things started to happen to me. I don't want to go into too many details but let me just say that - when I heard the line ""Shield your eyes from all this misery."" I knew exactly what the singer was talking about...Thank You,James ""whatever happened to buying me dinner first"" Wilcox"
2,"man.... that's just bad coaching.... -""hoop dreams""","they once were... coulda been... but in the end.. just like the rest.. they gave into temptation for a better life.. better food and easier chicks.... all i have to say is.. although the album is the best... the history behind the band brings the quality down... therefore, i can only bring myself to give it a 2."
5,Bivouac!,"This is a great cd from start to finish and has to be my favourite album by the band along with Dear you!. The album kicks off with one of Jawbreakers first ever songs they recorded previously which is shield your eyes and is a great opener. My fav tracks are sleep, parabola and Bivouac with chesterfield king been another ok track. Well just buy it if you've got the cash you wont be dissapointed unless your an apathy ridden sea clam... hate to pass judgment though...."
1,"Waste of Time, Money, and effort...","This game was a bomb seriously. If you like slow gameplay, easy scores, horrible checks, and annoying announcers go for it and buy this game. It has no shoot out, and most of all it has NO on-line play. I rented this game twice, cause first didn't like it, so I gave it another shot, but NO... I have a long time fan of EA Sports NHL games, but this one bites. I went and bought myself NHL2K3 the game is awesome in most every way, and it's on-line! Go get yourself NHL2K3 if you are really into hockey, play the sport, used to play the sport, watch it, or whatever. Don't waste your time on this..."
1,Bought it. Sold it.,Let's see. Where do I start? With the awful camera angles? With the un-updated rosters (Byron Dafoe in goal for Boston???)? With the un-intuitive menus? With the inability to save game settings? Save the money. This game is an abomination. It plain wreaks.
2,WHY??????,"Well the soundtrack is good. That is about the only good thing I can say about this game. The camera angles are awful. You either can't see your teammates/the net or the camera is way too far away. They haven't improved the create a player at all. There are no spin moves (maybe PS2 has them still). Exteremly inferior teams will light you up with about 8 goals, while you struggle to score one. The animations don't match up with the gameplay, and furthermore the animation looks more cartoonish than last year. I would take this game back and buy it for PS2 but what I've read from reviews it ... on that platform as well. Bad bad move EA"
3,Not what I expected,"I will repeat with what I have read and agree with""The animations don't match up with the gameplay, and furthermore the animation looks more cartoonish.""also agree with this""This is the first time I've every played the NHL series on the XBox. Previously, I've played it on the PC with NHL 2002 and NHL 2000. Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed with NHL 2003. ""Only have had XBOX for a couple of months now but I expected a lot more from NHL 2003. PC versions are MUCH better detail and camera shots are better"
4,Great Game!,"Great action plus great story line make an awesome game. G Police proves this formula is right. I bought G Police 2 before this one, and I have to say this one is harder than it's sequel for which I had to give 4/5 stars. Some missions are rather frustrating, but overall it's a great game."
5,Must Have for Gamecube Games on Wii,"If you plan on playing your old Gamecube games on the Wii, you have to have a Memory Card. This one works well. I've stored up to 4 games on it at once. Haven't had any problems with it at all. It is easy to access from the Wii menu to erase old data."
5,Enjoyable and informative,"* Review of unabridged audio edition *This long but well-written book interweaves a social history of the guitar, genres of music in which the guitar has played a lesser or greater role, and the author's own experience in having an acoustic guitar custom-made for him. Despite the length of the book, there are still topics I would have liked to hear much more about, such as jazz-rock fusion and the electric guitar in general, and I suspect that other readers/listeners will find their own topics they wanted to hear more about. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any guitar aficionado. Also, the narration of the audiobook is so good that it's hard to believe that the narrator isn't the author himself."
4,A GOOD TRAINING TOOL,The ISO 9001:2000 Document Development Manual is a comprehensive document to transform the existing systems manuals and applicable procedures to new requirements without spending to much efforts.
1,WARNING,"This system really does sound fantastic .... but only if you have an iPod newer than 3rd generation. Despite it's claims it is actually NOT compatable with 3rd generation iPods! It will play it but not charge it, and it will freeze the iPod if you try to use the controls, the remote does nothing either - you have to take it off the system to change tracks or albums."
1,control with fail!!!!!,"careful shopping with this vendor, the control that i bought has a fail when push the square, the product does not appear to be new, very careful."
3,You get enough for what you pay,"Well, it's a cheap flag and it feels just like that. It doesn't mean it's a bad product, but you must be careful while handling it. It feels like can be easily ripped."
4,lpmgman dictionay of english language and culture (1998),THIS BOOK IS NECESSARY FOR STUDENT OF ENGLISH TRANSLATORSHIP AND WE NEED 3 BOOKS
2,NHL 2003? GET NHL HITZ 2003!,"Well, i got this game, and I was looking forward to this. It's fun, yes, but there are some problems. It's gameplay is the best part. But still not that great, Camera angles [stink], you can never get to the man nearest the puck, and you can't see anything. ON COVER IT SAYS: Fastest game on earth! maybe? but, the camera starts shaking and freezing when it goes to fast. Also, a lot of shots you take are very unrealistic but still fun. It's awsome to go and hit people down for no reason, but the fighting is horrible, horrible graphics. This game has bad graphics, it is a disappointment, and the soundtrack is cool, Papa roach, jimmy eat world, etc. Yet, it just doesn't fit the game! HOCKEY? ROCK? If you're deciding what hockey game to get, definately don't get this one, and get NHL Hitz 2003."
5,Diana Kennedy's Mexico cookbook,"A lot of people have already reviewed this cookbook so mine is somewhat anticlimactic. But being a South Texas native raised on Tex-Mex, I can say that most of this book is NOT on Tex-Mex but on ""interior of"" Mexico's cuisine.That includes Yucatan, where the ""pibil"" style of cooking with achiote paste is typical. I bought the book because I know a fair amount about Tex-Mex (Norteno) style cooking but not so much about the recipes of the interior. I found the book to be easy to read, the recipes are not too complex, and in general it's a good buy in paperback."
1,"AWFUL, SAVE YOUR MONEY",BOYZ II MEN HAVE NOT PUT OUT ANYTHING WORTH LISTENING TO SINCE II AND EVOLUTION. THIS C.D. WAS GARBAGE.GLAD I BOUGHT IT BOOT-LEG FOR $3.
2,this book might appeal to a few vegetarians,"If you like books in which the amateur detective is an aggressive female, her lover is a whimp with muscles, all the meals are meatless, and an irritating parrot repeats phrases after hearing them once, Death Hits the Fan is just the book for you. In this mystery, a science fiction author is murdered at a small meet-some-authors gathering at a bookstore. The premise is good, but the characters are either boring or irritating. I kept hoping that one of the men in the book would eat a steak, say ""shut up"" to one of the women, and find a backbone. I also hoped the parrot would fly away, that the female characters would exhibit some common sense, and that the book would end. The book finally ended, but none of my other hopes were realized."
1,The worst book I ever attempted to read. . .,"I wish I had listened to the 1st review which showed 1 star! What a disappointment! As a matter of fact one third of the way through I couldn't bear to read anymore and tossed it out. In trying to provide an adventure filled story, the writer sacrified the depth and flow needed to make this an interesting read. From the beginning, I was unable to develop any real feeing for either of the main characters. I am an avid reader of romance novels - historical and scottish being particular favorites of mine. I can honestly say that this was perhaps the worst book I ever purchased. Sorry Ms. Cameron, please try again."
4,very charming book,"If you like BEL AMI 's photographs , I recommend you to purchase this postcards-book. In the book, you'll find many cute boys .But , if you prefer more muscular guys , I suggest you to buy the photo-books of Jeff Palmer , Ed Freeman , Tom Bianchi , etc."
3,Costly !,"I love the Casio CD/DVD printer, but these ribbons are costly and don't give you much for your money. They could make them cheaper and give us more product."
4,Starter motor for 1990 Nissan Pickup D21,"I first went to three neighborhood auto stores for a replacement, their prices ranged from $121 to $278, their core charges from $30 to $60, warranties from lifetime to 30 days, and the more information I got, the less I believed their replacement data was correct, so I did not want to give them my core then find what they sold me would not work. Amazon had one for sale at $127 with no core charge, it works fine, and has a one-year warranty. I am happy."
3,You can do Better with your Money,"Positives: detailed fluid sound, especially for a non-moving coil cartridge. Surface noise is kept to an acceptable level. Its ""middle of the road"" specifications should give it a wide arm compatibility. Though I would not recommend mounting it to a cheap tonearm. I had it initially attached to a Pro-ject 8.6"" carbon arm, and the sound was too bass heavy. Compared to an ortofon 2m red, this cartridge is quite a lot betterNegatives: Sound isn't dynamic enough; kinda too laid back. Its worst feature is the humming it emits when close to AC power sources. Ie the vast majority of belt driven turtable motors! I wouldn't recommend it on this basis alone.I would very much recommend a Denon Dl-103 over this cartridge, as the price is comparable, yet the denon is a true moving coil cartridge with a very solid and dynamic performance, most probably the King at around $200 price level, with NO HUM!! Thanks for reading."
5,Wilderness Evasion,Anyone interested in the outdoors should read this book. Lots of useful information. I am an avid hiker and tracker and have read many books on these subjects as well as backcountry medicine and this book had many things which i had not even considered. Good read!
5,Must Have!!!,This is a must have for any survivalist. I give it a 6 out of 5 stars. No filler pages whatsoever. Every word found in this book is useful. Thanks for making this info available!
2,Not as good as others,"These pads prevent leaks but I found them to be uncomfortable compared to other (and yes, more expensive) products. They did not stay attached as well due to only having one adhesive strip. I also thought the padding itched a bit...not good in an already sensitive area. I'm not even finishing the box before I go back to the other brand. Disappointed since all the other Medela products are so wonderful."
4,They don't stick!,"So far these are the only pads that don't stick to me, so I love them. I am a B or C cup, and didn't leak often. I also didn't bother with the stickers, they stayed just fine within my nursing bras without the sticker. They do get a little stinky though...."
5,Best Ever!,"I used washable pads with my last two children. I decided to try disposables this time. These are fantastic. They are thin, absorb a lot, and are comfortable to wear. I ran out of these and tried the Avent brand and did not like them nearly as well."
5,A must have!!!,"The best nursing bra pads! They hold alot of moisture in, preventing embarrasing leaking! Conveniently individually wrapped pads. I recommend these to all lactacting mothers!!!"
2,Itchy Boobies,"These made my boobs itch so badly! When I'd take my bra off, I was covered in red lines from them bunching together and I had to sit for 5 minutes just to scratch because they itched so bad. They still work, but the adhesive is about the size of 2 m&m's and better nursing pads are cheaper."
2,"These will work, but I prefer others","These pads are very thin and do not show through your clothes. I never leaked much, so these pads worked fine in that respect. However, they do not hold up when you open your nursing bra for frequent breastfeeding. The adhesive on the lining does not stay stuck to the bra and the absorbent filling comes loose and bunches up.If you have these, they will work, but I much prefer the Lansinoh pads."
5,i have tried every breast pad/ this tops all!,"Every single breast pad available doesn't compare. They either show thru your clothing or they leak through after 1 episode of letdown! Medela is wonderful. I wear them & no one can notice. Once i got caught without any extras & had to go almost 8 hours & was leaking like crazy because baby or pump wasn't available. They held up without leaks & still kept thier form. Too bad other companies ( like gerber, evenflow, aveda) haven't caught on to this wonderful design."
1,Terrible Product,These breast pads did not work for me. They are cheap and rip easy. Unfortantely I bought a big box and don't like to waste. So I wake up soaked in the middle of the night. As a new mom I value what little sleep I get and these pads are an inconvenience. I would definitely go with another brand!!
1,Return required,The plugin panel on the back of the screen flopped around when I tried to connect the wiring. A blue line developed on the left of the screen and this seems appear at random and may or may not be there when the set is turned on and may start up suddenly an then go off for a while and then reappear later. I though it would be easier to buy this online but I sending it back and heading to Best Buy. Maybe I got a lemon and maybe they are all lemons. Won't look at the brand again.
4,Good equipment for a very low price.,"I was looking for an equipment to make Stroopwafelen (Siroop Wafels) just as part of our bakery hobby. I found equipments from Belgium and Holland, the cheapest 1600 Euro! Very good pieces of equipment when you have a bakery shop. For us that was just to make some of these wonderful cookies we bought the first time in Holland it is good enough, easy to use and clean, gives good results and it looks like it is well made. MAybe for a bussines will be better to buy a more sophisticated equipment."
4,provide my computer perfect protection against viruses,it is easy and convenient to install and operate. the updating service let me feel it is reliable to prevent new viruses. but it may cause the computer's operation a little bit slower.
4,Was a gift.,My brother wanted this older version for some reason and I bought it for him as a gift. Can't say anything good or bad about it...hence the four stars for its price.
1,Worst Symantec Product Yet,"I have run Norton Antivirus on my PCs for several years with no issues. Whenever my subscription runs out, I upgrade to the most recent version.I did the same thing this year and I'd have to call this year's version worthless. After installing, the product worked for 5 days and then started giving me errors about not supporting Repair. Symantec's site tells you to re-install the product. I have now un-installed and re-installed the software several times spending way too many hours trying to get it working correctly, but nothing works.I work in the IT field, so I cannot imagine how someone with little or no technical knowledge would ever get this to work.And I have to pay for their support just to get it working? I don't think so - sounds like a scam to me.There has to be a better product out there!"
1,Would not install on my XP machine.,"Could not fully install program on my XP machine. The 4 fixes offered on the symantic website did not solve the problem. Symantic does not offer phone assistance without an additional charge. I think it is absurd for a company to charge a new user of its product for installation help. A 900 number is listed on the box. I reinstalled the product four times without success. Ultimately, after wasting hours attempting to get the product installed, I mailed it back to the company per instructions on their website. Hopefully, they will handle refunds better than installations.I downloaded a competitors software without any problems. Try Mcaffee as an alternative."
2,Annoyingly Complicated,The product loads improperly if you already have an older version running and must be activated within 15 days. So don't buy it until you're about to us it.
1,Stay away....,"Norton AV has been good to me for many years, but this 2006 version is a piece of....Issue #1: Could not install/reinstall/uninstall when NAV 2003 was installed. Had to manually edit the registryIssue #2: Bios batery went out and clock was reset. This forced product to re activate, and now after getting a new battery and updating the time, NAV says I have exceeded my # of activations... Oh and to fix it, you must call a 1-900 #.....Bye bye NAV..."
1,"Installation could break computer, require XP reinstallation to fix","Do not buy this software, it could break Windows during installation. I spent hours trying to fix XP, and eventually had to reinstall XP to fix it. I bought a 3-user licensed copy. It was successfully installed in the first computer. (The automatic set up for live update does not work, but that's a separate problem.) When I installed it on the second computer, it broke XP. None of the programs could be launched afterwards. It left Windows XP in a totally unusable state."
2,"Big hat, no cattle","I had several annoying adware programs that I wanted to get rid of, so I purchased Norton, thinking that since they were the big kid on the block that their software would be able to handle some run-of -the-mill adware programs. Wrong. It takes a very long time to run, and even though it would say that it found the offending software, it was unable to delete it. A friend told me about AVG Anit-virus software by Grisoft (which for some reason Amazon does not handle) and it did an amazing job and it runs much faster. I ended up removing the Norton program from my computer since it was not providing any real useful service."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A MENACE,"The only reason I'm giving it one star is that I'm not able to give it zero stars. It all started when my Norton AntiVirus 2005 was about to expire and it asked me if I wanted to renew to Norton AntiVirus 2006. That was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. It took four days to undo the damage it wrecked on my system and I'm one of the lucky ones. It didn't wipe out my hard drive or render it wholly inaccessible. However, I was not able to access my email and then the rest of the desktop functions. If you need to contact tech support you're calling India and it's very hard to understand them. In short, this product is awful. Don't use it. If I had the time I'd lead a class action suit against them. They're the worst. Avoid them at all costs."
1,Waste of time and frustrating,"I bought this version off the internet and it never functioned properly. I tryed to run ""Liveupdate"" numerous times without success. This wasted many hours of my time. (Without liveupdate the software is not kept current and becomes worthless.) Then I went to Symantec's website and wasted another 45 minutes trying to locate the technical support phone number (the extended package that I had bought included free technical support -- apparently you just have to invest an hour or so of your time to actually extract the phone number from the company.) After spending 2 1/2 hours between many phone calls to the support line, the problem was never resolved. The company did say they would refund my money in full (my fingers are crossed). I calculate that I wasted about 10 hours or so over a frustrating period of 3 months. Don't buy this product and spare yourself the pain."
1,NIGHTMARISH PRODUCT,"This product is more than just useless -- its actually destructive. The ""ccapp.exe"" in the best case scenario slows your computer down to a crawl -- in the worst case scenario it will shut down yr email, cause system crashes consistently, and ultimately shut down your computer entirely. Norton has been well aware of this problem since August 2005 (as evidence by consumer postings to their site) yet their customer service/tech support staff is totally unable to resolve the issue (potentially due in part to the fact they are answering the phones in India). Do NOT install this product."
1,Has major problems don't waste your money,From day one I have been unable to update the virus definitions. Each time I get the same error but different methods to fix. None of the fixes have worked. I'm cutting my losses and going to try McAfee. Someone in the store said Nortons was the best. I don't believe it.
1,Don't even do this!,"I, like a few others, decided to ""upgrade"" to NAV 2006 and lived to regret it! Shortly after upgrading, my system was attacked and Norton didn't even know it. Someoen suggested PCTools (pctools.com) as an alternative so I tried it. It not only found several problems that NAV didn't, PCT eliminated them and I haven't had a problem since. Older versions of NAV worked good but they've lost it somehow with this version."
1,Shame on you Symantec!,"Have been using NAV for quite a few years, with reasonable performance (not great, but ok). Recently updated to NAV2006, and voila, constant system freezes, constant BSOD's, sometimes cannot even reboot the machine. Ran the web-based Symantec uninstaller, and system is completely rock-solid stable again. Needless to say, I am no longer a NAV user."
1,Too good to be true,"Received as a gift for my eleven year old son, he loves building things. It looked like it would be a great addition to our other architectural building projects. The connections are not precise, making it very hard to fit the pieces together. The pieces fell apart as we tried to add on. Pieces didn't fit plumb or square. The directions are abbreviated and difficult to follow. The tower ultimately met its demise while trying to attach the third bridge span; one of the main towers broke off, snapping the wood beyond repair. Sadly, it's in the bonfire pile for the spring."
3,Questionable...,"I love blueberries and purchased this so I could blend the frozen blueberries, fresh sliced pineapple and many other fruits together. Unfortunately it heats up so much that the motor stops. After ending up with the fruits on the kitchen counter, I called Vita-Mix and they advised that I should add more water. After adding more water it froze again and Vita-Mix told me that I should defrost the berries. With added water option which ruined the berries taste or planning in advance by leaving the berries out few hours before blending, it was not serving the purpose so I had to return the blender. I am sure that 2000 RPM is powerful and useful for something but certainly not for what I had in mind, lots of blueberries."
1,Customer service sucks at Vitamix,I just bought the latest model the 5000 and the machine is good but the price is quoted wrong. According to the Manager of Vitamix they add tax at all times so the price you see is not the price they charge at vitamix. If you go through ANY vender they always add extra claiming tax. So if you authorize the price they will attach tax in addition to it. Check your statement when / if you still choose to order. You will have to call your credit card company.
1,Don't buy waste of money and Energy,"We bought the Vitamix 5000 about 1 1/2 years ago. Since then we had only trouble with the machine. With the easiest load the motor shuts off and I have to put it in the fridge, because it gets overheated. Despite returning it 3 times for repair the issue is still not resolved!I then asked for our money back but Vitamix's customer service was very unfriendly and refused to refund.To anyone who wants to buy one: Don't do it!!! You have only trouble and the customer service really sucks. Save yourself some trouble... I'm not a review writer but that Vitamix matter was really annoying. I just wanted to let you know what we ran into.We are most likely looking at the BlendTec instead hoping that a) it actually works and b) we get better service in case we do need it."
5,Best Blender Ever Made,"I used to have a cheap blender I bought from a local retailer but I was always dissatisfied with the kind of juice it made. Blend tomatoes and it would leave out the seeds. One day I saw a demonstration of Vita-Mix 5000 Series blenders at a local show and was blown away. I bought one and what a world of difference it has made in my life. You can do practically anything with this blender from smoothie and hot soup to whole gran bread dough.It is a versatile machine and very powerful. The only downside , if you can call it that, is that it is quite loud. You may not hear your phone ring when it is on but despite the noise I still think it merits 5 stars rating. They now have a newer version 5200 series but the older models are still adequate and they all come with 7 yrs warranty. The containers are shatterproof too. They may be expensive but they can last a lifetime."
5,Aliens v red necks,"I had a wonderful time watching this goofy alien versus red necks film. The script is an original bending of bad Sci Fi drive in movies. It is gory and has some over the top, bad taste humor so I cannot recommend it to people with kids. The film is part grind house and part B movie spoof. No Oscars for the acting but the cast looked like they were having a great time. Every character is a stereo type but the film takes these folks and twists them into something interesting. There are some genuine laugh out loud moments in the movie. The body count is high. Most of the characters die in some unique and entertaining way. This is a really great rainy weekend film."
3,just fine,"It looks in deed great but there is defect in the design of the ankle part,which is a little bit thin. I have difficulty in getting it on and also taking it off, even though it's my size."
1,Not happy,"I registered for this monitor but just recently started using it. My daughter is 9 months old and started sleeping in her own room when she was 6 months. I've given this monitor several tries and everytime I just wanted to smash it to the ground, well, last night we finally did and it felt great! All you hear is static and loud obnoxious beeping. My friend has one of those monitors with the camera so you can see your child as well as hear them. Buy that one...its more expensive but well worth it!"
4,"Great, clear monitor","It's excellent. Very clear, almost no static, and the voice-activated feature is the best. The out-of-range alarm can get a little annoying at times, if it wasn't for this, I'd give 5 starts. SONY does a great job. I highly recommend this monitor"
2,Can't Recommed,"After reading all the great reviews and trusting the Sony brand, I got this monitor as a shower gift. I am not that impressed. It picks up a lot of static at times, shuts off at times (with the green light on, so you don't notice right away), beeps like you are out of range, when you are only in the next bedroom. Seems to work better plugged in, and I unplugged my phone that sits next to it, seems to help also. We only live in a apartment, this product would be really bad in a large house."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"I felt very comfortable getting this product because of the Sony name. Let me tell you some of the things this monitor does that would want you to select others. First of all it eats through batteries every 2-3 days. We have even tried rechargable. The receiver does not come with a cord to plug in so it is constantly beeping, therefore, I had to go purchase an adapter for another $15. Everything interfers with the signal. Do not put it close to remote, phone, or any other item that could cause a signal or it will start beeping very loud at all hours of the night and morning!"
2,Very Disapointed!!!,"I bought this monitor when my son was born because I thought that Sony was a good name and it would be a good monitor.... we were very disapointed. The range is horrible. We live in a small house and I will have the receiver just down one flight of stairs and the range bell goes off. Very annoying. We also have a Fisher Price monitor for our daughter and it is so much better, I am going to take back the Sony and get another Fisher Price. DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED!!!"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought the Sony based on Sony's reputation. Obviously baby monitors are not their specialty. There is almost always static, and I can hardly walk to my front door without the range alarm beeping."
3,"Thirty-Love, not in Capriati's favor!",Whoa! Renovation must have made this on a low budget! The characters are harder to control than a truck without a steering wheel. Get a life and play some real tennis!!
2,Disappointing,"This book focuses on breadth rather depth, providing a good spectrum of factoids about the two parks. However, it seems like the amount of info on any subject was rarely ""just right."" Either the topic was so obscure as to warrant exclusion, or was interesting but too thinly covered.The reason I only give the book two stars though, has to do with the nationalistic tendencies of the authors. The book is fraught with episodes detailing how good and clever the Canadians are with Waterton, but how dimly the Americans have administered Glacier. Having traveled extensively in Canada over the past decade, I find this national inferiority complex common and annoying."
2,neutral,Did not view the dvd.Do not care for the two sided format on the disc.Love the series but would like it to be on one side.
3,A pretty good intro,"This is a short but solid intro to perl's Test modules. Easy to read, mostly easy to follow.What it's not:* an intro to TDD methodologies; for that you should look at the Beck book* an in-depth guide to the full array of Test::* modules. There's a section on using MockModule and MockObject, but like all the other chapters it's basically just one example of a class + a test script with a brief discussion of ""What just happend?""* Cheap. With largish print and only 180 pages (including index) the cover price of $29.95 is no bargain.Still recommended for someone trying to get started with perl test frameworks."
1,"""Higher"" Education","Might be a usefull book if you are a parent trying to get your kid into re-hab, othewise... don't bother. Not worth the trouble, and a rather sad commentary on ""higher"" education."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought that this book was helpful to the research that I was doing. It had a lot of helpful hints on how to contruct hand puppets (although it did go into other types of puppetry) I also liked the fact that on Amazon is was so inexpensive. I would recomend this book to anyone who wanted to learn how to start their ouppet collection, or to any beggining puppeteers. this is a good book for younger children because it is easy to understand."
5,"Yes, defence.","I haven't read the book either, but I have read another book by Wong Kiew Kit, and found it to be jolly good. I noted that that book was written in British style English. I imagine this one was as well. ""Defence"" is a British variant of ""defense."" Hence the ""10,"" to counterbalance the hasty ""1"" in the previous review."
2,Not at all like the first one I bought,"I purchased this speaker thinking it would provide the excellent sound quality of a similar mini cube speaker I purchased at a drug store several years ago. My older one still works beautifully, but I had need for a second one. This mini cube speaker has a terrible scratchy sound at any volume above ""very low"". It was not expensive, but save your money and don't hope for the best like I did."
5,Very comfortable,I got these shoes for my husband and he loves them. He's already wanting another pair in another color.
2,why no sizes for big adults?,I recently discovered Sanuks. I'm trying to locate the SUV model but find only US sizes 7 an 8. Why not sizes for regular adult men. I wear a 10 but no joy in finding them.
4,Works as advertised on a compaq presario laptop,"The part costs ~ $60 new from HP! Wow, what a rip off. My only complaint is that the merchant did not pack the keyboard well and it arrived bent. But he sent a replacement and all was well.I installed this on a customers's presario laptop and it has been working great for over 4 months."
3,video,The video is good with the storyline of a goddess and spirits. The action is good with the romantic sense.
4,Rockin' it old school,"The game that started it all... ahh, sweet nostalgia.I first played this at a neighbor's house, and wanted to go back just so I could play Sonic the Hedgehog. It's not as elaborate or well-established as future games (though it contains many basic elements like golden rings and the Sonic Spinball), but like Final Fantasy 1 or Super Mario Brothers 1, this is a classic old game which started off a wonderful series. Not to be missed."
5,Blast processing at its roots!,"Sonic has hit a major speed bump the past half-decade, but before that half-decade, he was on fire! Starting in 1991, the blue blur's first outing was one of his best. As Sonic, you go through 6 zones in high-speed action while tracking down a fat evildoer named Dr. Robotnik! The controls were pretty simple: You use a D-pad and a button to play. The graphics were full of 16-bit awesomism. The sounds and music were top-notch. The main challenge in the game, however, is not the difficulty in the zones as you progress through them, but instead, they are the Special Stages, in which you must finish an act with over 50 rings to access them. Then, in the Special Stages, you must guide yourself carefully to the Chaos Emeralds.Sonic's first hit was a blast. If you like Sonic games, especially the retro Sonics, give this a shot if you haven't played this one before."
2,Easy Breezy Read,"Original story and characters in this light and easy breezy read. The plot moves at a slow pace which makes the book seem much longer than it is. I won't continue with the series, it's just not for me."
5,A great book,"This book is about a young woman, Claire, who has moved to a new town, where she meets Michael, a nursing home administrator. During their relationship, they discover that they have a common tie to the past. The book then shows the 2 struggling to overcome the difficulties from the past.The book was a great romance book, but there was more to this book than just romance. To some degree, there was a murder mystery at the nursing home. There was also the lesson of forgiveness that Claire and Michael discovered as they revisited their past. And there was Nana and her love and concern for Michael and Claire.This is a book that I would highly recommend."
2,dont bother,"I wouldnt buy this product when you can buy exactly the same case plus accessories for less.Nintendo DS Lite Pro Gamers Kitthe Nintendo DS lite Pro Gamers Kit includes:1)safe screens2)game buds3)car adaptor4)game safes (4gba cases and 4ds cases)5)dock it6)2 finger tip stylus's7)extra pen stylus8)neck strap9)screen wipeYes this one still had an odor when first opened, but I aired it out a couple days and its fine. even if ya hate the case the accessories are well worth it. So dont bother with this one get the kit."
3,How to dance tango,"The are lessons about the basic of tango. Bonus some short movies with different schools of tango and a little bit balet.Also exceptional movies in color with Carlos Gardel the famous Argentinian tango singer. That makes an film of exception.The lessons are easy to folow and gives an opportunity to learn fast how to dance a basicaly tango. A chritical mention about the quality of the picture, witch is not the best one."
2,Mediocre,"Although the materials on this tree are decent, it is VERY unstable. The top perch is wobbly and when our cats try and jump down, the entire tree comes dangerously close to toppling over. However, it should be noted that the cats love the sisal scratching posts. I would advise spending more money for a better piece of cat furniture."
5,"Tearful, beutiful and a must read!!","This book is amazing I read it in tears half the way, you really feel for Sara."
4,Great book! Highly recommended!,"I have several books on Blue Ridge Dinnerware and this is the best. A great book to have to identify that unknown pattern,almost every pattern I search for is in there. Great color & page design. Highly recommend for purchase."
3,Annie's Favorite Crochet Dolls,"Frankly, I was disappointed. I felt the title and cover of the book was misleading because I was looking for DOLLS to crochet, not doll clothes! Most of the patterns in this book are for Barbie doll clothing, not for actual dolls to crochet as is shown on the front cover. However, the few dolls there are to crochet are cute, which is the only reason why I did not give the book a lower rating. But if you are looking for actual doll patterns and NOT doll clothes, then I would save my money and look elsewhere."
3,if you want to know dirt....,"This entire book is about footing....soil testing, issues, management,.....What I thought I was buying included guidelines as to how big to plan an arena for various uses, .... and that was never covered.So, if you want to know dirt, soil, ...it's great. If you want more, it's lacking."
5,superp and moving,"bell hooks challenges the economically and educationally advantaged white feminists who would conduct their discourse amongst themselves rather than allow a Black woman to offer her own ideas. In fact, ideas are the purpose of this book, allowing ideas to proliferate in the classroom instead of allowing racist stereotypes prevail. This is a courageous and brilliant book, and something of a threat to the institutionalized and priviledged feminism of white women, particularly at the universities of this country. White feminists ignore this book at their peril, and should read it immediately."
4,Just Installed (very YELLOW!) (awaiting how long these will last),"I wanted something yellow for my fog lights, and PIAA gave me something yellow. These aren't the ""piss colored"" yellow you get with Lamin-x films. These definitely help in dark/bad weather. I get compliments from my friends also. Now they want to get these set of bulbs! However, I've heard varied results about how long these lights will last (from a couple of weeks to over two years). I've handled these bulbs using my latex gloves; hopefully those bulbs will last a long time (knock on wood!). That is why I'm leaving that last star off. Thanks for reading my short review."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"Please take my advice and don't waste your money on this product. I made the mistake in buying this product. I thought I would save a few buck's and get something that would work. Wrong! It does not work for removing pet hair at all! It cost me more money, because I had to buy something else that would work, like the ""Love Glove"". Spend a few more dollars. It's worth it in the end."
2,You get what you pay for.,This fan is good for a cheap price. I got it and it is flimsy. It .020 thk aluminum and it bows in the middle when you put your laptop.
3,coulda been better,"its alright, wish it would blow a little harder since my laptops heat is all on the side, it gets really hot so once it gets too hot its very difficult to cool back down."
2,Not so good,"I was disappointed in this product. The company was great, I got it quickly. I just thought it was a more durable cooling pad. When I sat my computer on it, the pressure caused the fans to stop. I was able to rig it so that it works but I shouldn't have to do that. I quess for what I paid for it, I shouldn't expect more. Oh well lesson learned. I have nothing against the company that sold it. I got the product immediately."
4,Pretty good cooling pad,"Here is my simplified review:-It serves its purpose pretty well.-It is not any louder than my HP laptop's fan.-It blows air up, so it is probably best for a bottom air intake laptop.-The bottom is open, so it is not even an option to use on your lap.-If you use a powered usb splitter to power it, then it would be great!Powering a device from your computer (like this cooling pad) means that your computer is working to power it. My computer does feel cooler, but it runs just as much or more.For use on a desk, this is a good cooling pad and price!"
3,USB Powered Metal Cooler Pad,This product is ok. I don't think that I am getting sufficient RPM out of the fans to cause any real cooling.
3,3 Fans Metal Cooling Pad,"When I received this item, I confess, I was expecting a bit sturdier construction. It was a little difficult to tell what it looked like underneath from the photo, but it does the job. I started using it the day it arrived, and it's a great deal for what I paid. It was cheaper than anything that the retailers who offer you great deals were charging, for a similiar item; and that includes the shipping. A total of But I can't use it when I travel because the fans underneath are exposed. I mostly use it at my desk or on my bed, with the old chill mat underneath it to shield the fans.The best feature about this cooling pad is that it's tilted, which makes using the key board a breeze; no strain to the wrists even after hours on the laptop. Oh, I should say,"" one my motivations for buying it, was because of the three fans, and my laptop is 17"" and it holds it just fine and cools it a lot better than my old twin fan chill mat did."
3,Cool then trouble,"Product worked great for months, then suddenly started causing my computer to reboot. I thought it was the usb port, but the trouble occured no matter which port the fan was plugged into.Probably won't buy another."
3,Decent cooling power but too small!,"I have a 17-18"" laptop and this cooler is a few inches too small for my laptop. I have to put the laptop on it with the left side lied up and the right side hanging over to allow it to cool the right places. also, the lip at the bottom of the cooler doesn't seem to ""catch"" my laptop (not sure if its suppose to do that or not though) i probably would have ordered a different cooler if i would have known that it wouldnt fit with my laptop. however, the incline of the cooler makes it easier to type with the laptop up at a little angle!"
2,Works great... while it actually works.,"I was initially very satisfied with this fan. Its lightweight and does its job in keeping a laptop cool. The sharp edges mean if you are going to actually use it on your lap, you might want to have a pillow or some other surface for it to rest on, but this is really no big deal.However, a mere month after I purchased the product, all three fans have gone dead for no apparent reason, making the fan nothing more than a useless piece of metal with jagged edges. $20 isn't going to get you a laptop fan that will last years - but I had certainly expected it to last longer than a mere month."
2,Exposed,"I like the overall design, but the wires are not enclosed on the bottom. They are constantly getting hooked on things."
3,Not good if you are going to use the laptop on your lap,"The Cooler pad works great if you are using it on a flat surface. There is no bottom. In other words, all the fans are exposed at the bottom and do not expect to use your Laptop on your lap using the cool pad. Otherwise it works just fine."
2,You get what you pay for,"Ah, well. It worked well for a few months and then the exposed wires at the back connecting the on/off switch with the fans got snagged on something and broke. I guess I'll spend a little more on a more well-made one now."
3,No color photos,"If your going to write a book on ""identifying"" plants, it really should have color photographs. How can you be sure you have the right plant? And then you want to try it by taste testing it? Not too bright."
1,What happened to the colors?,"If a person wants to just read about edible and medicinal plants, this book is ok. If a person wants to look for and identify plants, this book is as useless as teats on a bull. I'm suprised that people haven't been poisoned by wrong colored plant thinking it was medicinal. Nice pencil drawings, however. Don't take this book out in the wild or in your backyard."
3,usable but not as impressive,"i can use this book, but i thought it would show photographed pictures. the pictures were drawn and you really can't appreciate the true colors of which coud make a big difference in survival situations. otherwise an informative book."
3,"Nice book, but not the best","Nice book but not as useful as ""The Forager's Harvest: A Guide to Identifying, Harvesting, and Preparing Edible Wild Plants."""
2,cracking sound,"I am a fan of Six Organs of Admittance and I feel this is their weakest effort. The first track is allright. The second track could have been good as well, but it has a dominant and irritating cracking sound that ruins the entire track. What a shame !"
5,Great Book -- Fun to Read!,"This book is very fun to read with your child. In just a few words, the feelings of those grumpy bunnies are easily conveyed to your toddler in a sing-song, rhythmic tone. My 2 1/2-year-old can recite it almost word for word and loves to read it. We borrowed this book from our local library, but this is definitely a book we'll need to add to our home collection!"
4,"Enjoyable supernatural, action/drama anime series","This is a nice DVD collection of this enjoyable supernatural, action/drama anime series. I decided to give it a shot after watching and enjoying the OVA series a little while back. I was not disappointed. It's definitely worth watching/owning, especially if you liked the OVA series and/or original manga. Anyhow, in this anime, you get a nice mixture of supernatural action, memorable characters/good character development, comedy, and some nicely done emotional parts(drama). The animation quality is pretty good, the soundtrack is very good and effective, and the character designs are good and nice to look at. If you enjoy supernatural anime shows like Yu Yu Hakusho, I would definitely recommend this series to you, although, it is not as nearly over the top with the comedy as in Yu Yu Hakusho. Well, even if you are not a Yu Yu Hakusho fan and just a fan of action/drama anime in general, I would still recommend this series to you."
2,Learning through experience,"I was disappointed because my expectations for the price were much higher than were realised through the short one dvd programme. It was professional, and a good overview, intended for educational purposes and setting, but short.With the title ""Great Religions of the World"", and the price tag, I was expecting more like a full length programme dedicated to each of the Great Religions. In part I must take responsibilty for the mis-purchase, through an impulse buy based on the great title, and not reading the product details sufficiently.The price problem was exacerbated by having to pay an additional 15% tax on import to UK, and an additional post office handling charge equivalent to about $12."
4,Good for a leaky door,"Here in Nor Cal when we get blessed with rain, it would find it's way under my garage door. with this ""storm shield"" i was able to stop the problem. now if we get rain, maybe this year, it will not leak. i would put some caulk around the side at the end of your runs as well."
4,Works as promised,"I found this material easy to work with (in warm weather - don't wait until winter!) and it does the job well. Other reviewers have cautioned about there not being enough adhesive but I think that's probably because they (like I) put down too much of it. It just requires a thin bead on each side and a squiggle down between them; anything more is wasted and has to be cleaned up.My garage door is a little beat up and not straight at the bottom. I had replaced the seal at the bottom, but still had gaps because of the un-even-ness of the door and the floor. In combination with the bottom seal, this threshold provides a very good, tight seal. I just have to be careful getting the snow thrower out (so the leading edge doesn't catch on the threshold) but otherwise no problem.I'm giving it four stars because of price and instructions that are a little vague about using the adhesive."
3,Fairly Effective,"This threshold keeps out very litte from blowing into the garage. It is somewhat difficult to install and almost impossible to keep in a straight line. There is not enough adhesive provided for the installation so be prepared to go to your hardware store or somewhere to purchase some additional adhesive. If you get the adhesive outside the boundaries of the threshold it is quite a chore to clean up. On the plus side, the threshold is still firmly in place after about six months."
4,Good product,Bought the 20ft to break into 2 x 9ft sections for my two garage doors. Easy to cut and install. First heavy rain and no leaks so far!Only issue is that the provided adhesive was not enough to cover the installation of so many feet of threshold.
4,Easy to install,Very good product. Installed completely in around 30 minutes. No light comes through under the garage door anymore with the tight seal.
4,Did the job,"Our new (old) house had water seeping under the garage door in heavy rains. This threshold did the trick - no more water in the garage! It is kind of wierd looking having a rubber lip on the floor of the garage door opening, but I'll take wierd any day over puddles in the garage (and on our stuff!)."
4,High quality product,"Works as expected, Installation was a little tricky (my floor is uneven) because how it has to line up with the garage door for proper seal."
4,does the job,"I wish they had a solution for uneven garage floor, also I think its pricey.Its price should be $15 to $20"
4,"It works, but get the extra glue!!!!","This was easy to install and does the job of preventing rain from seeping onto my garage floor. But...do yourself a big favor and get a tube of Liquid Nails for vinyl before you start the job. There is NO WAY the small included tube of adhesive would have been enough. Also, roll out the threshold a day before you install it to make sure its absolutely flat before you start."
1,Overly Simplistic and Untrue,"Page xiv says it all: ""Although the proprietary strategies I personally trade differ from those employed in this book...."". This is an overly simplistic, pathetic portrayal of mechanical trading systems that do not work and will not work. The book is overly technical in some areas, assumes a programming knowledge (e.g., metastock), and is generally a great sleep inducer. I am sorry I bought it, even at the discount."
5,Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban,"Definitivamente mi favorito de los seis. Es, a mi parecer, el climax de la serie completa: cuando te enteras de cosas, cosas, y más cosas. Cuando todo -o bueno, ""todo"" con Rowling es como al 15% de el real ""todo""- hace click. Es cuando Harry pasa de ser un niño, a un adolescente. Me es imposible expresarlo mejor, porque de esa manera terminaría en un mes, pero léanlo y suerte."
5,Amazing!,"Out of all the Harry Potter books, this would be my favourite! I loved how Sirius was so nice to Harry! I also liked how there was so much about Harry's Parents. I loved this book especially when they all found out that his dad was a Animagus along with everyone else.. I was so upset when I found out that it was ***** who dies in the next book! I haven't even read it yet and I'm sad anyway!"
1,Offensive and weird,"I don't think you need to hypersensitive to find this book offensive, and not in a redeeming way. The characters in the original story are not particularly ethnic, but in this book they are very ethnically Jewish. While I realize that Scroogemacher turns out to be nice, and I don't claim the book is meant to be offensive, the idea of a Jewish Scrooge is not a stereotype that needs reinforcement, especially to kids."
3,Excellent when originally produced,"The detailed topography shown on the map, and especially the information about wildlife and history, are very good. However, the map is seriously out of date regarding roads and tracks. These features are ones which users of the map are bound to depend on, and it should be a simple matter for the publisher to update them."
3,RECONDITIONED MEANS MISSING PARTS,"LOVE THE FAN/HATE THE MISSING PIECES!!! While I purchased this back in March, we just had a heat wave hit us and I ran to the storage to get the fan! Upon opening the box, I was surprised at the poor pack job, but figured it would be fine. There were no directions, and/or manual, but I can assemble anything, so I quickly put it together, that is until I got to the misting/fan face part. NO SCREWS ANYWHERE TO BE FOUND! I started looking it over and the fan face was cracked in one place and missing a good sized chunk at another. The plastic base and face are yellowed from age/sun damage? After rigging it with craft wire and plugging it in, I love how it works, but be forewarned that you are gambling with this purchase. It might just be worth it to purchase new from Frontgate and get everything as promised! After all, mailing this thing back is most likely going to cost me the difference!"
5,"best small, inexpensive phone","I have read all the negative reviews for this phone, i own this phone for the last 7 months and never had any problems, only drawback that i see with this phone is lack of external caller ID."
4,2 Cute!!,I have had this phone for about 6 weeks now and I think it's great! The only thing I don't like is that you have to actually flip the phone open to see who's calling. It's small enough to fit in your pocket and you don't even know it's there! This is a nice lil' phone if you are looking for the basics.
2,Major problem,"I use my phone very little for incoming calls. I prefer to have people call my land-line phone and leave a message. A couple of times, though, people have left a message on my cell-phone voice mail, and I did not get the message until about 24 hours later. These were important business calls. I assumed this was a problem with the service provider, but when I spoke to a representative, he said it was a problem with the phone and had been reported by others. He advised me to buy a new, different phone.I have also had a problem with the instruction book, which is inadequate in its coverage. Also, the illustrations are almost impossible to decipher with their tiny print."
3,No Closed Captioning,"I got this video because it was supposed to have CC and my wife needs that to understand what is going on. I gave this a three star rating, but would have given it a five star rating if the CC would have worked. It is advertized as having CC but doesn't."
4,Typical rocking Suzi.,Great guitar riffs and hooks. Great songs that hold up after all these years by the first lady of rock.
4,Warm and soft,"I got these a number larger than I normally get, because I have a very high wrist, and wasn't sure it would fit. They feel small in size, so the fit was perfect. They are very soft, and very warm, but I feel like I ""fall down"" to the floor in them, which is why I am only giving 4*. I also feel that they at times don't manage to warm my feet if they are already cold, which is a problem. But if I wear them all day, my feet are warm and snugly. I don't regret this purchase, and would recommend them to others."
3,"Just ""OK""",These slippers are comfortable but they are heavy on your feet. i purchased the navy ones and every time I take them off I find navy lint all over my carpeting.
1,Comfort? Don't buy these.,"If you are looking for comfort from the various foot problems, these are not for you, they lump in the wrong places, the toes bunch too close, and after awhile, the ""softness"" disappears especially after washing and hanging them to dry (don't put them in the dryer...)Really disappointed with this product."
2,Not So Great!,"These slippers are barely okay. Definitely not great. I wear slippers around the house whenever I'm home, so I need something that provides arch support and stability on my hard wood floors. Also, I wanted something to replace my worn out memory foam slippers, these do not even compare in comfort. The soles are not very cushioned, and my feet stay tired. I feel my feet ache with every step. No arch support at all. I've got them now so I'll keep them, but I'll mostly use them for running outside quickly and I'll get something else for wearing inside. I gave these 2 stars instead of 1 because the material is soft, but the comfort stops there. Some reviewers complained about the tag, I found that the tag on the footbed is easy to remove with a seam ripper."
2,sooo noisy and dorky,These slippers are ugly and sounds like you are wearing tap shoes! They are so obnoxiously loud I hate these. I bought them based on great reviews....buy something else...you will sound like an elephant.
5,"Great, comfy and soft!",I love these for around the house. They are so comfy and after a day with heels on these feel so good to put on. I've tossed them in the wash a couple of times and leave them laying to dry and they plump up again and are cushy. I had to order another pair as my dogs thought they were great too....for chewing on!
1,not as advertized,very disapointed . only holds 100 ft. of garden hose not 150 as advertized . buyer beware .
3,Time will tell,"I had tried Buchu in the past with great results almost imediantly. This time I cannot tell that it is doing anything, at least not yet. I will keep taking it and hope for the best."
3,Still Worth It,"I liked Sniff 'n The Tears' first CD so much, I thought I'd take a chance on another. This is one is still good, but not quite as good as the first one. I would still recommend it to Sniff fans, but if you were luke warm about ""Driver Seat"", you probably won't want to purchase anything else from this band."
2,Jammed and doesn't shoot straight,We bought this pistol for my soon for Christmas. He loaded it with the pellets supplies and tried shooting it. We shot at a target and you can see the pellet vering off to one side. Also after a couple of days the gun just jammed and won't shoot and we can't get the clip out. I sent the gun back because it is useless. Maybe we just got a lemon.
5,All black version - low on power high on fun and value,"Mine certainly doesn't hit speeds above ~200fps. No chronograph needed, its pretty obvious. The hop-up system is also ridiculously turned up. To the point the airsoft bb will actually rise above your point of aim for ~20ft.However, this is a pretty darn good replica m1911 replica for the price. the thumb web grip saftey works as well as the slide lock safety and the slide and hammer spur interact in a convincing way. The magazine is also of good quality. The slide open locking switch does not work. Trigger is very light and crisp (due to the poor spring power) Given the price I say this product is a nice toy to play around with if you are a fan of the classic m1911 look and feel but dont want to buy the more expensive full metal replicas or a real one."
5,Wonderful!,"I purchased this gun as a beginner and was impressed. After playing airsoft for a good while now, I am more and more impressed all the time. I ""graduated"" to .20 gram bb's and the accuracy of this gun is impeccable! With a 21 rd magazine, good feel and practically perfect shot this is one of the best spring pistols that I have ever encountered or used. I own two of these and my sister owns one....my only complaint is that the notch that holds the clip in the gun got chipped on one gun so I have to hold the clip in, but I am pretty sure that it is a fluke deal. I cannot express how fantastic this pistol is...buy it buy it buy it.....For this price and quite a bit above, you will not find this quality again!!!"
4,GOOD gun,this gun looks good.I got the black and its full metal without the orange tip it looks real but its illegal to remove those.the gun is not entirely accurate but that is due to the hop up system. Reloading can be a hassle without a speedloader. All in all this is a great gun but the accuracy a bit off. 4 stars.
5,great quality,"very authentic and durable. the gun is powerful, accurate, and fun to use. the magazine holds about 25 bbs. definitely use .20 gram bbs because of the hop-up system built in"
4,kids review,taking a pretty long time to ship my friend has it we love it hope it come very soon hope this was helpful
3,NOT WORTH 20 BUCKS,NOT WORTH 20 BUCKSI wouldn't recommend buying this gun falls apart very easily and I have had to repair it 2 times
1,Why the High Rating?,"I bought this pistol and was really disappointed. It gets a high rating by many people. But I don't see how they could like it, if it's like mine.Pros1) Inexpensive.2) Nicely weighted. Feels good in your hand.Cons1) It's a pain in the thumb to load.2) It has a small capacity magazine.3) If the pistol is leaned downward, even a small amount, the pellet rolls out of the barrel on to the ground! So you can't shoot at anything lower than eye level.4) If you line up the sites to aim at your target, you'll always miss by about 6 inches low (for a target 20 feet away). In other words, the sites are more than useless.Maybe I just got a lemon. My friends who tried it found the same problems I did. Luckily, it's a cheap gun. So I didn't mind having to throw it away."
1,"Crap, don't bother.","Just got this gun today, shot one full clip with it, pretty accurate. But then when I was cocking it and playing with it, the whole gun exploded open. Every single piece inside of the gun shot out all over my living room. Can't believe I wasted my money."
3,Good for a beginner,"This was my first ever airsoft gun. I mean, it's not that amazing, although good for a first gun or for a beginner. Ideal uses for this gun are small games between a couple friends. It doesn't really hurt, only up close. Good for beginners."
5,COLT 1911A1,THIS GUN IS SO REAL LOOKING AND THE FUNCTION OF THIS PISTOL IS GREAT!THE GRIPS EVEN INTERCHANGE WITH THE REAL COLTS AND OTHER 1911'SMAKES A GREAT WALL HANGER ALSO.FAST SERVICE AND GREAT PRODUCT I GOING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE THIS WEEK FOR THE MY REENACTMENT GET UP.....THANKS .MATT
5,"Powerful, accurate, worth its price.","didn't expect much out of a $21 airsoft gun.. doesn't make the best sound when it shoots, but it is very powerful and accurate. don't use .12 BBs, for you have to aim low to hit the target. it shoots .2 BBs like no other airsoft guns of the said price range."
3,Significantly changed the texture of almond bark,"I used these to color almond bark for dipped strawberries. I used an entire jar to half a package of almond bark in order to get the vibrant orange (then separately blue) color I needed (I used a crockpot little dipper for melting the almond bark). The texture of the almond bark was significantly changed when the coloring was added, it became much like a corn starch and water mixture. This resulted in there being a much thicker coating on each strawberry and I had to work with it extremely quickly once the color was added. I would not use this product in this way again."
1,100% Worthless,"I got this game for free with my new video card. I thought, hey, pretty cool, I remember the arcade version.I put the disc in, a dashboard screen came up. I chose install. Nothing happened. A few minutes later some process kicked in and the game limped through installation. After installing I tried to start it, but it just hanged on the opening screen.I uninstalled it, made sure my drivers and system (directX version, etc.) were current and reinstalled. Same thing. This is on a P4 2.8 GHz, 512 MB RAM, 10,000 RPM S-ATA Raptor drive, 128 MB Diamond Stealth (GeForce FX 5200) video card, Win XP SP1a. Certainly not the baddest, but most would agree a capable machine for running games in These Modern Times (7/2004).Ironically, I gave it a shot on the old junker I'm replacing and it came up fine. So maybe this is the reverse of the classic gamer's warning: instead of ""be prepared to upgrade,"" it's ""make sure your hardware is outdated enough if you want to run this game""."
4,Grandpa's Boy and What Became of Him,I enjoyed the book about a man that worked at the same place I had worked. It answered many questions about his life that I had wondered about. It brings out many things that can be accom0plished by someone that has physical limitations
3,Songs Are Good - Voice is Average,"There are some good songs on this cd but the singer is for lack of a better description--ordinary. One of the highlights is Malcolm's duet with Gary Beals; otherwise, it's mainly a cd that will please the teeny boppers. Maybe Ryan doesn't quite know what his style is yet?"
3,A True Canadian!,"Ryan's album is a must for any of his fans from the show. The songs showcase his unique voice and introduce us to his songwriting ability. ""Star of All the Planets"" is an amazing song that really allows Ryan to prove why Canada chose him to be their first Canadian idol. While he may not have the vocal range of Kelly Clarkson, he is talented, charimatic and down to earth. I gave this album a three star rating because half way through the cd I felt like some of the songs sounded too much alike. However, considering the limited amount of time that went into pulling this album together that is understandable. Regardless, the cd is a great addition to any Canadian Idol fan's collection. If you saw Ryan on World Idol and liked his performance you should also check out this cd.PS. Any disappointed Gary Beals fans should check out Ryan's duet with him, ""Don't Dream It's Over""."
5,Much better than other Idols,"This is overall an excellent album. In comparison with the other ""talent"" to emerge from Idol, this is MUCH better than the lackluster offerings from Ruben and Clay. Clay was way too schmaltzy and uninspired, and Ruben's album was just boring and cheesy. This album has much more to offer in both writing and performance."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","One of the worst album I heard in the last years, it put people to sleep very fast! Seriously, I'd like to give a better review but I honestly can't, Ryan has a monotone voice and the songs on this album have dumb and 'cliché' lyrics. Nothing new here."
2,I really wanted to like this but...,"I was really excited about watching this DVD because I never remember it being on television. It suffers the same fate that ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" did. It just too boring and slow. I love, I mean love, Ellen Burstyn and her performance was good. Yet the film moves too slowly. I love the theme of the film so much. O' my God just imagine getting one more day with your loved one. That's my favorite part of the film. The flash backs are too long and it causes the film too drag and it becomes too predictable. There should have been more concise editing. On this DVD I found the sound to be very poor. In the scenes with the mother I had to turn my HD TV volume almost too max. What could have been a great film never quite makes it past first base and unfortunately strikes out."
3,Wanted a cap...,"I had some squeeze bottles like this but they didn't have a cap, so I ordered these with caps. They came with caps, but they fit so loosely that they might as well not be there at all. Definitely not air or water tight, or even spill proof. Not exactly what I was going for, but they were cheap and they are otherwise well made thick plastic bottles."
5,JellyCat Bear,LOVE!!! JellyCat stuffed animals. Would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a stuffed toy for their children. They are built so that they are just the right size for little ones to hold.I plan on purchasing more.
1,busted,"The band broke during the 1st week.... I probably could have sent it back, but didn't feel like the hassle..."
5,Great desktop replacement!,"I bought this computer to replace the eMachines desktop that I had. I had only bought the eMachines desktop last October, so only had it for a short time. Thought that I just wanted to clean up my desk by swapping a huge box for a portable laptop. Turns out that the processor on the laptop is better than what I had with the desktop. Better ""Windows Experience Index"" than the desktop. Love the camera, fingerprint reader. The only thing downfall for this laptop are the built-in speakers. They are very tinny and not a very good sound quality. If you don't listen to music, then these are just fine. I just plugged in my speakers from the desktop into the front headphones jack and that worked just fine. With 2GB RAM and Intel centrino duo processor, great speed. Finally, I want mention, that I swore I would NEVER own a laptop. Mostly because of the keyboard and my big hands. This does not pose a problem AT ALL with this laptop. Overall, great computer. Thanks Toshiba!"
4,An Excellent Sounding Reissue.....,"I am always a bit wary of re-issues because I have found the improvements in sound quality are not really worth purchasing the album a second time. This album is an exception, however. The original release was so bad it warranted a remastering. The music really comes alive on this re-issue, as if you are hearing it again for the first time, so to speak! However, I can't give it five stars because they needlessly split it into 2 separate CDs while it could have easily fit onto one, as the original release did. I can't see this as anything more than a marketing gimmick, because for the purchaser it is nuisance, disturbing the continuity of the recording. Other than that, this is a thoroughly enjoyable re-issue, prompting me to consider purchasing more of the Japan re-issues."
2,Correction - not so good,I always buy Sketchers. These are cheap and comfortable. The treds are a bit different from ones I've had in the past but they don't seem to make a difference. They seem just as good. I am interested in how the treds will handle the snow but it hasn't started snowing yet so we'll see.That paragraph was written before the snow hit. These shoes are awful for the snow. The soles are terrible. I feel like I'm walking on ice just going up and down my stairs. I love Sketchers but i won't buy any with these soles ever again.
1,"cracking, peeling after 2 months","When I bought these shoes, I also bought the best spray, leather shoe protectant I could find, and gave them several coats, in fact I used up the whole can because I manage a restaurant, and they do get fairly dirty. After every shift I would wipe them down with a damp cloth, and then a dry cloth. Well, to my dismay, AFTER TWO MONTHS, THEY BEGAN CRACKING AND PEELING ON THE TOP!!! I have to throw them away!! Is this real leather? WHAT A HORRIBLE WAIST OF MONEY! SKECHERS, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!! I ONLY WISH I HAD SAVED MY RECIEPT! DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES!!!"
3,It's Okay .... for the price,It's not the best shoe for going out or for work. But it does the job for 1 year. Recommended you should replace your shoes/sneakers for every day wear at least 6 to eight months.
3,its ok,"i got this for my kindle to do bedtime stories with my kids, its pretty good for a kid understanding level but I do have to do some word play changes to make it little more understandable to them. Breaking it up into stories instead of just straight verse by verse through the bible would go a long way to make it better geared for kids as well. It works but it could be better"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Last revenge.The end of the Demon Princes series is also the weakest part of it, as the last opponent to be tracked down has gone a bit quiet, after attempting to control both the crooks and the cops where he has decided to hang out.This knowledge gives him a start to finding Treesong, his last enemy, along with his colourful underlings.3 out of 5"
4,Make sure you have a free HDMI input on your TV,"To take advantage of the technology of this DVD player you must use a HDMI cable to use the 720p/1080i resolution output. If you hook up the player with component cables, you will be limited at 420p resolution. This is apparent if you pay close attention to the description: ""The DVP-NS75H single-disc DVD player offers 720p and 1080i upscaling through an HDMI connection."" To be fair, most up converting dvd players output the 720p/1080i signal only through the HDMI output as well. This is very important to consider especially if you only have one HDMI input on your tv (like I do) and if you are already using your HDMI input for your HDTV source signal. If you only have component inputs on your tv, dont bother buying this player and find one that will output 720p/1080i through component. With an HDMI cable though, I could not ask for more out of an upscaling dvd player. Very satisfied"
2,Careful - this HDMI DVD player is NOT a HD player,"I bought this DVD player specifically to play High Def DVDs but it will not play any of them. Unfortunately I assumed that since it came with a HDMI cable and had high def all over the box it was a HD player. When it would not play them I read the manual closer and it does not list HD DVD's as one of the types of DVD's it supports. It does NOT state anywhere that it does not support them, even in the section that lists the formats it does not support.The player will also not play any burned DVD copies which play without any problem in my old DVD player. I purposely tried to play them in the old player when I got the 'format not supported' error."
4,Takes A While To Start,"After thoroughly researching the Web, I decided to buy the Sony DVPNS75H DVD player. I've been happy with the performance so far with the only annoyance being the loading time when you insert the DVD. My previous DVD player, also a Sony, pretty much played the DVD as soon as you popped it in; but this one takes about 20 seconds to ""warm up"" before it starts playing."
3,"Love This Player - Dissappointments, Too","I've just replaced my 3rd Sony DVPNS57H. I would rate this unit a 5 except for the following:I love this machine for many reasons, one of them being the HDMI output to my HD television.All three units worked fine, excellently in fact, for about 4 to 8 months. Then, for no reason, they all started freezing up during DVD playback. My first model caused me to return several DVD's to sellers as flawed.So, for the price I kept buying the unit because it really is the best for the price....until now.John CrawfordWest Los AngelesI have just ordered the Sony DVPNS90V with full upscaling to HD, with HDMI outlet, etc. I'm hoping for the best."
5,Just Perfect for HDMI,This is a perfect HDMI CD/DVD player. I played DVD's via the HDMI and they upsample to nearly HD quality. The optical out lets me plug directly into my receiver with great results. My music CDs in both WAV and MP3 formats that ususally skip when played on a lesser device play perfectly.You'll need an HDMI cable for this device but a 6' cable can be found for around $10.
5,IT'S A SONY,"Purchased this player on Amazon to support my new SONY LCD projection television. Hooked it up with Monster HDMI/HDMI cable (also purchaed on Amazon at great savings). It works great. Picture clarity of my DVDs improved over the normal progressive 480P player I replaced. As far as the so-called bright blue light that many reviewers were complaining about, this can be adjusted to a dim setting via the players set-up menu. No problem. All my audio/video components are SONY. SONY makes quality products."
5,Great purchase!,"I picked up my player today. I have another (hdmi) dvd player, but when I hooked it up to my Sony 46"" LCD TV, I was really disappointed in how my dvds played on it. They were okay but not great. This player was on sale today so I bought i t and switched the 2 players. What a world of difference! The picture is much clearer and crisper. I am very impressed and extremely happy I bought the Sony. Until the HD war is over, I wanted a good player to watch dvds on on my new tv. The player is hooked up with a hdmi cable (that I payed about 12 bucks for and works great) and set to 720p (that is the resolution of my set) and I tested it out on a couple of movies (Pan's Labyrinth, X-Men 3, Casino Royale) and I noticed a big improvement over the other player in picture quality. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I also got the last one in the store!"
5,"great value, for the high quality picture fans",this dvd player is great. it is easy to use and the quality is great. i recommend buying some good hdmi cables. i bought the cheap ones and sent them back for the philips hdmi cable because i have a philips lcd tv.
4,"good unit, not as compatible as listed","I purchased this unit after a serious back injury to put my monitor on the wall over my bed... it works great, but I had to firt have the outer ring of holes (VESA 100 holes) so that it would properly mount to my Samsung 172W monitor. Once modified for proper installation, it works perfect! It could use a longer arm, but other than that, it is great."
5,Looks great,"The wall mount looks great! I have not yet purchased it, but from the details and descriptions, it makes me want it. I'm sure many people will have this on their wish list!"
5,Fantastic music!,"Jesse Cook is an excellent musician. Very dinamic music, Have enjoyed very much!He plays from his heart!Thank you very much!"
3,Frontiers CD by Jesse Cook,Loved th CD but the case was cracked when it arrived. Did not want to go through the return process so I will keep it as is.
5,Best CD I've heard for a long time,"I heard Cafe Mocha on the radio and wanted the CD. It was all I hoped for and more. I like every song. The mood is Spanish and romantic! It takes me away to another place, a very good place! Jesse Cook is an amazing musician and composer. Take a chance, you won't be sorry.Seattle, Washington"
3,Frontier with gitar,"I,am a lover of nuevo flamenco-music, that's the reason I buy these album. I,am not disappointed in Jesse Cook. He fits perfect between names as Ottmar Liebert, Govi, Gipsy Kings en Armik. I appreciate his custom to put a few voice-numbers on his album. A little bit variation is not bad."
2,Works only for very small quantities of light food.,It wordks for such food as onions. For something heavier it is awful. Mine starting smoking and stopped working.
5,Great songbook,I had this book years ago and it fell apart from much use and moving a great deal so I was glad to get a better copy.
1,Thanks for the warning.,"Thanks for the warning everyone. This is a great album, but I will not buy a ""protected"" version of anything."
4,LOOKING FOR GOOD WISDOM TALES,"I'm always happy to find some new wisdom tales, and this book has a few that I haven't seen before. It was very helpful to have the guide for better storytelling.For those who like different tales, have you seen Ayat Jamilah: Beautiful Signs by Sarah Conover? It has tales from all over the world, and most of them are new to the written scene"
1,don't buy,I bought it and the memory sucks so bad that the game that needed it still needed more memory it only has about 15 blocks
1,this review is not helpful,"since when does ""being the daughter of immigrants"" give you leave to be a blatant racist?utter TRIPE."
3,Natural law applicability to the internment of Japanese-Americans,"Under the natural law principal of self defence and group survival,the internment of Japanese-Americans,under the conditions that our country was in at that time, is morally defenceable. Was it the best thing to do or was it insensitive are secondary questions which can be debated."
1,Embarassing,"Painfully anti-intellectual. Irresponsible. Inaccurate. Laughably desperate in its attempt to sell copies through controversy. The author is a hack version of Ann Coulter, which is just about as low on the subhuman species food chain as one can go.Grab a copy if you desire, but be forewarned: your IQ will plummet as a result."
3,Be careful what you ask for....,"It's an intriguing argument, coming from a Filipina like Malkin -- after all, we are at war, and the Muslim terrorists are known to be of Middle Eastern, Indonesian, and FILIPINO descent. And frankly, racial profiling is infinitely more sensible than forcing Granny to take her tennis shoes off.Perhaps we should take Malkin's advice, and give her a one-way ticket to an internment camp."
1,This woman,...is a total and complete nutcase. She makes Ann Coulter and Tammy Bruce look halfway reasonable. Utter crap.
1,I know longer fear hell!,seriously trying to justify this on any level only implies that they can do it again and better than before this like much of america's past is very cold and unacceptable to the american public. it shows further proof that we where put in to a world of fear and terror by the ruling elite and it only seems we are heading right back in to the trap. I hope they paid you well for this book cause my soul doesn't come cheap Malkin. oh yeah and although i never believed in hell i can assure you that i no longer fear it for i will be in great company should i actually arrive. i will finally get a chance to talk to some of these power players and maybe get in on how the ruling elite is doing such a damn good job of ruling haha i might even get to hook up with Malkin...i mean she is a super hot reporter ahhh what a future!?!
1,Michelle Malkin--a very useful idiot,"I want to thank Ms. Malkin for revealing, in the harsh sunlight of day, just exactly how foul and perverse the rightwing has become in America. Internment, pre-emptive attacks, lying to the American people, admiration of power and authority--these are the disgusting values of the rightwing thugs who have assumed the mantle of government today. Ms. Malkin does a tremendous favor for liberals, as she shamelessly flaunts her twisted, amoral values, willingly exposing them for all to see.I doubt we Left can repay her adequately for the service she has done for us by writing this innane book. Now if she could just write a book advocating slavery, she would make the favor complete."
1,Hateful,"How could anyone call themselves an American Christian and work so hard to destroy the very foundation of our country and the words of Christ? For the Love of God madam, have you no sense of integrity. Is this what Fox stands on? This sounds more like the early years of Germany in 1932-3. God save America from this prostitution of truth, decency, and honor. This book and that of Lowman's is a disgrace."
1,In this day and age,I'm afraid that I was not able to get all the way through this book. I was too repulsed by the extreme racist views of the author. It makes you wonder who's side she was on in World War II.
1,Lower than Worthless,"Bottom line: This degenerate squawking was ghost written and published for cold, hard cash---and that's it. Malkin is a sellout of the lowest order. She's the perfect example of how an insane freak can rise to power and get published by a major company.It doesn't take brains or scholarship---all it requires is a good sellable ""hook."" And Malkin's hooks are fear and racism. What a truly lovely human being she is.Seriously, watching Malkin speak is very reminiscent of the ramblings on video of the Heaven's Gate cult leader that talked his followers into killing themselves. Both that nut and Malkin have the eyes of dark madness! Check it out. Sickening.Put this book on the shelf right next to David Duke's fine written pig droppings---two drops in a pod."
1,AWESOME book - all KKK members should get a copy!,"Give me a freakin' break. This woman works for Fox News, that should tell enough where she's coming from.If the author can find a justification for locking up Japanese Americans during WWII, her next book is probably on the justification of slavery.It is easy for her to pick on the Japanese Americans because she knows Asians won't complain or organize a protest rally. It is also easy for her, as a white person, to defend taking away the freedom of minorities - I'd love to see what she would say if they locked her parents up during WWII!"
5,There Is A Cheaper Way,"I love this book. I have a copy and have read it twice. I have thought about selling it, since the price for it is so high but I just can't bring myself to do it. Even if I were to sell it for $2,000.00, I would feel that I didn't charge enough. The money would soon be spent and then I wouldn't have this book. However, there may be a cheaper way for one to purchase the information contained in this book. Basically, Hale Dwoskin has taken the content from this book and placed it in the five (5) books: ""Happiness Is Free and it is easier than you think"", series. So, while this book is excellent and I won't part with mine, one can still receive the information contained in it from these other books. In fact, Hale has added some of his own releasing techniques in these other books, so they are even better. So, if you are lucky enough to purchase a copy of ""Keys"", good for you, but if you can't, you can get the same information a cheaper way: ""Happiness Is Free"" five (5) book set."
2,Table Picture Book,It's expensive for a nice table book that doesn't give you much information. Nice pictures.
5,RANGO IS FUNNY!!,The greatest western in the world. It is funny and full of action. The director of pirates of the carribean made a movie that is better than the pirate movies. And if you want a good Jhonny Depp movie than Rango is your movie.
2,Rango,This movie was not funny nor was it entertaining.The creatures/animals in this movie could give kids nightmares.Boring all the way through.This movie was just plain weird.I will give one extra star for the animation though.To bad it's not enough to save this movie.
2,Not a fan,"I did not like this movie. Matter of fact, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I am rating it two starts because my husband said it was ok. He has more of a taste for these kind of movies than I do.I thought the funny parts were not very funny. I didn't really care what happened to Dirt or anyone in it."
5,Bonus!,"Good price, super quick shipping AND Amazon automatically added a copy to my Cloud player. I will be buying more movies from Amazon in the future!"
4,rango,It was a cute film even for us adults.The Blu-Ray made it really fun to watch.Having the DVD to travel with is also a joy.
4,Perfect movie for the adult kid.,"I personally found this movie greatly entertaining while also providing fantastic visuals and charming characters. Though by Nickelodeon, it's not necessarily for children, though they can also enjoy it to some length (several jokes are adult-oriented).This being said, it is even MORE worth it for the combo pack from amazon at this low price, no reason not to get it."
3,Ehhhhh...,"Note: This is NOT a movie suitable for young children.The music and animation were fantastic, and there were a couple of moments in the film that deserved a chuckle. However, I had the feeling that the writers were trying too hard to make the movie edgy enough to attract adult viewers. I could have done without the four letter words, semi-gruesome imagery, and the jokes about mammograms and prostates. I mean, really?"
1,bad language for PG,"The title of this review says it all. Cute story, but I was suprised at the language in this show. Not to mention the topless Barbie at the very beginning. Yes, I realize topless Barbies do not look exactly like topless women, but it is very suggestive for little kids. My oldest (10) looked at us oddly with some of the language and barbie scenes in this show--if he knows it is inappropriate, then obviously it is. I suggest watching this before you let your kids watch it."
1,Not a pleasant movie to watch.,"For a story about a lizard sheriff, it was very gritty. It wasn't pleasant to watch, like an animated movie usually is. I don't mind movies going outside of the norm, and in fact, I appreciate that, but there weren't any characters that I could identify with or that I felt had any redeeming qualities about them. Even the hero seemed like too much of an antihero to get behind. If you watch it, think of it more like a real western like True Grit instead of a cute animated movie. Because this movie certainly didn't achieve cuteness."
1,Waste of my time movie,"This movie has got to be one of the dumbest movies on our planet! My 20 year old daughter who was with me at the time said it seemed like a project they were using to practice making animals and then decided to make some money on it and smooshed it together into a movie. During the whole movie we kept looking at eachother saying ""are they serious?!"" There were a couple of laughs, but mostly a waste of our time movie!"
2,Rango,"I like Western movies, I like Johnny Depp. This movie is about a pet chameleon who ends up in a desert town in the middle of nowhere. The characters in the animation looked great.But this movie is nowhere close to the other animations like Up, Nemo, Incredibles, and other similar movies. I thought that it was not targeted to adults. Perhaps children would probably appreciate it more. Although my daughter laughed a few times, she lost interest quickly also. My wife told me that I started snoring after the first half an hour. :)I see from other reviewers that a few people had an issue with the language. For me the language was not a problem at all. Maybe the story did not keep my interest."
2,Blah,"Kids' movie? Hardly. Rango is a violent, crude, and worst of all, boring movie. Can't recommend this one for anyone under 16-years-old, and can't understand how anyone over 16 would like it."
3,Good but not Great,"I have been holding out on watching this movie for a while now. But I finally watched it. And I have to say it's good but not great. In today's saturated animated movie market, no one will actually remember this movie. While it was fun, it's nothing special. The whole western theme was amazing though. And character animation and details were great. Johnny Depp was excellent as Rango."
5,Great movie!,"love love love this movie, i could watch it over and over. really great family movie and just so funny!"
1,What a waste of time....So disappointed,"This movie was AWFUL!!I watched it and had hoped it would be an entertaining film, and it was not, the plot line was slow, extremely predictable(even for an animated film) And the characters you could not learn to like at all! I cannot believe that Johnny Depp agreed to do this film and put his name on it! I hope I never have to watch it again. My daughter 8, watched it too, and she despised it as well. Many reviews say it is more for adults...but I did not see that point either. I am shocked to see that the overall ratings on this movie are higher rather than lower. I am not a movie buff, and I never write reviews on them (this is my first), but this one was such a let down...."
1,Are we there yet?,"I got this delivered from Amazon because generally I like animated movies. I don't have kids and don't have any affiliation with kids so this review is not with kids in mind. Yes there was mildly strong language, get over it.the visuals were stunning. Details were awesome on the animation. And that's it. The story dragged, the plot was forever being delayed and I fell asleep the first time I watched it. I thought maybe it was because I was tired but the second time wasn't any better. This movie is just bad. I liked some of the action scenes but too much of this was reminicient of Dungeon Crawl. Slogging through the crap to get to the treasure and when we get there it turns out the treasure is an old shoe. Or in this case an old gunslinger. I really wanted to like this movie but it fell flat to me. I suppose some people liked it but I just couldn't stay into it."
1,Not a great kids movie and too silly for adults,"This was just a weird movie- not made for kids at all, and really too ridiculous for adults. Tweens might get a kick out of it, but regardless of who they were marketing this to, it's a lame movie that really isn't worth your time."
1,Really bad movie.,This was a really bad movie. Do not buy it if you like funny kids movies. It was not even worth renting!
1,Rango is NOT kid friendly,This is not a kid friendly cartoon movie...for something created FOR children..the content and language was horrible. What happened to childrens movies being safe and free from cursing?
2,Rango review,"Seeing the ""promos"" on TV of Rango, it appeared to be quite entertaining...cute & funny. It was quite disappointing as it was not all that it was ""hyped-up"" to be. Funny parts..animation good..purchased because of Johnny Depp and the animation. A lot better 'animated' DVD's."
2,Didn't make it 5 minutes into the movie,"Maybe this movie gets better after the first 5 minutes, but my 2 y/o daughter said exactly what I was thinking after watching that much. ""Daddy, I don't like this movie."""
2,M'eh. Looks Terrific,"This is a great looking, clever animated western with a terrific voice performance by Johnny Depp. Trouble is, the fun bogs WAAAAY down in the middle.Worth watching as a clever, gorgeous homage to Westerns of Yesteryear, but kids -- and, possibly you -- may get bored after a short while."
3,'Meh',"Predictable, vaguely insulting to it's character 0-caloric story. It's not bad; to be bad it would have to elicit an emotional reaction, or do something wrong - but the movie never leaves it's formula. Never steps outside it's boundies. Wholly unimpressive, but not terrible..."
5,Awesome!,"Adults, watch this movie and enjoy it like no other. Please be aware...this is NOT a kids movie...at all. It is an adult movie with adult humor and adult violence. Animated? Yes! But at it's soul, this is a western with unusual characters. Watch it as such and you'll enjoy it a ton!"
2,"TO LONG--To much , to much",Was hoping for a fast paced and funny movie. Was to long and trying. Don't think kids would understand or watch it/
3,Rango,"It's a ok movie I can see where kids will love it but, I found it a little annoying. there are alot better movies for family veiwing."
2,Quite boring,"It took me two tries to watch this movie. The first try, I fell asleep. The second try, I fought to stay interested. This movie could not hold my attention, I don't know how it'll hold a child's attention. The animation is very well done, but the story line and the humor was lacking. This movie will not be going into my Blu-ray collection."
3,That was the weirdest thing I've ever seen.,A grotesque environmental Western Music Man piece. Of course what do you expect from anything Johnny Depp stars in? It was just. Weird.
3,Its just ok,I wanted to love this movie but i thought it was just ok.....the kids liked it but they werent WOWed by it. Its language seemed a little too adult and a lot of jokes were adult based and the kids didnt understand. So its a 3 star movie from me.. Its worth the 3 dollar rental but not the 14 dollars to buy the DVD.
2,Hmm...,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released... And finally got released yesterday and I went to blockbuster right away and rented it. I am also a huge Johnny Depp fan, I mean HUGE! I love him, but I didn't really think that this movie was funny. I am so glad he had fun making this movie and I liked the little reference to one of his earlier movies in the beginning. I loved the lizard character and I thought he was an adorable animal but not that funny. I liked the change up of movies that Johnny did though! Good job!"
2,When does it end?,"I usually enjoy animated films -- this was a disappointment. I agree with most reviewers: this film is not for kids. The animation was top-notch, but the plot was weak and characters poorly developed. There was nothing interesting about the plot or the characters. Perhaps, it was written for people who enjoy the seen-one seen'em all westerns. Because I thought the plot was weak and the characters uninteresting, I also found the film too long. Perhaps it would have made a good short -- with the quality of the film depending primarily on the high quality animation. As is, I do not recommend watching this film unless you REALLY like westerns, Depp, and animated film."
1,I would rate it a -5 if I could,"This movie was so dumb, I felt myself staring in unbelief that it was even made. My 5 year old and I watched about 15 minutes of it, and I looked at him and said this movie is terrible. He agreed and asked if we could watch SpongeBob again. We both had the same look of disbelief, I think we lost a few brain cells watching this. I recommend that you spare yourself from this horror."
5,I loved it!,"Pleasantly surprised by this movie the first time I saw it. Unlike some movies, I hadn't seen tons of previews that gave away the story line and all the big scenes. Can't think of anything I didn't like about it. The characters are great and stick with you. It might not appeal to very young children, but it does to this adult. Maybe I'm just immature. : )"
4,Rango,"I really enjoyed this movie. My grandkids insisted I watch it so I gave it a try. I live in the southwest and was amazed at the innovative ways the movie used the local wildlife. Watch for the ""famous"" actor who got his break in westerns years ago in a cameo appearance towards the end."
5,Highly recommended for ALL parents,"I love this book and the philosophy of Rabbi Schmuley is so inspiring and really right on. I'm grateful to have stumbled onto his writing and his television show. He really can get to the heart of parenting issues, that it's so much more about the parents when the kids are having problems. It's a hard fact to face sometimes, and way more than many thought they were bargaining for when they planned a family. If mamy more families applied the wisdom of this book, I think we'd find such a better world around us."
5,Inspirational and Accountability,"This is a great and a MUST read! He does have religious references-- after all he is a Rabbi-- but, if you take his religious references as just that, an example, he has a great message of intregity."
5,Shah,"I loved the movie, was very good. Shah Rukh Khan good Bollywood actor,really enjoy his movies.Ra One was very good."
3,Funny,Good to get a quick laugh at. If you have a TIVO though might be a better way to enjoy if you have never seen it.
2,Crass humor; spiced with adult sarcasm,"This is a set of funny cartoons, albeit, crass, sarcastic, base at times, and sometimes outright vulgar, but never the less, entertaining, if one can get past the afronting style the writers for this show use. I would not recommend this for children."
3,Mediocre production values...,"The workout is good for an intermediate student - there's not nearly enough instruction for a beginner! The music is too intense and distracting, especially if you're used to a ""traditional"" music-less practice. The music is at almost the same frequency as Bryan's voice, so it makes it very difficult to hear his instructions. Bryan's constant chatter also makes it difficult to concentrate on the poses and, at the same time, listen for his instructions... the video seems to be more a vehicle for him to broadcast his philosophies than a tool for anyone serious about yoga."
5,Great workout with clear instructions,"This is a challenging routine, but not a hard jump if you've been doing the 2nd workout for a while. So many yoga routines are so basic and easy. It's hard to find one that is challenging, yet is easy-to-follow and feels like a well designed program. Clearly Kest knows what he's talking about. And his reminders to breathe, or lengthen your spine or to relax a muscle are perfectly timed every time.Go for it! You'll love it."
5,Great wisk,"We had a metal wisk and a silicone one, but found that neither was really working well for our non-stick pans. The pure silicone was too flimsy and the metal was damaging. This one has been great - you are able to get the food off the sides of the pans without scratching anything. I love this wisk."
3,doesn't 'program',"makes coffee fine. Program function doesn't work -- just beeps continuously. Support says to return item, but I don't want to bother."
2,Poor Design,I thought the concept of the coffee grinder and coffee maker was a great idea. It grinds and makes the coffee at one time. The problem is the moisture causes the grinder to gum up all the time. Also when is transfers the coffee to the filter it often plugs up the coffee drain which causes the coffee to over flow. It is a mess to clean up and it is a delight to wake up to the counter covered with over flowed coffee. I have stopped using the grinder and the coffee maker does make great tasting coffee. I thought the concept and price were too good to be true. It is still a good value coffee maker without the grinder. I like the feature that you can remove the pot while it is draining to pour a cup of coffee. The unit turns off the coffee draining and does not spill if you can not wait for the coffee machine to totally finish. It is a great wedding gift because it looks expensive and does work with some hang-ups.
4,Beans taste better than pre-ground...,"The smooth mellow taste of freshly ground and brewed coffee can't even be compared to pre-ground coffee. Yes, this machine is a little quirky and the parts look fragile. I haven't used it long enough to know yet how well it will hold up. I will say to everyone who complains of the mess of the grinds that I put all the parts in the sink and use the sink sprayer to spray them all out with hot water and leave them to dry. No mess. Also, I use the gold Cuisinart filter rather than paper and have no trouble with grinds in my coffee or in the coffee maker, plus the coffee isn't filtered through a chemically treated paper product. Four stars in stead of five because it does look fragile and one dial doesn't seem to do anything - the coffee could not be better!"
5,Great deal!,"I had this exact coffee maker for the past five years and it just went out a few weeks ago. I looked all over in stores and was never able to find a white one in this style. When I found this one I was a little leary with the price, but thought I would take a chance. It is wonderful!! It is brand new and works great! What a deal! I priced the exact maker for LOTS more from the manufacturer and almost paid that just so I could get what I wanted. I am so pleased with this product!"
4,Good bang for the buck,"I bought the Cuisinart DGB-300FR a few weeks ago & used it almost daily. I made coffee using whole beans. I used the timer to grind & brew the coffee - I had no problems with it and the coffee was ready when I woke up in the morning. The coffee also tastes pretty good. I love using whole beans. The smell coming from the machine is fabulous!I didn't think cleaning the machine was too bad...however, I would just rinse the parts with water in the sink & place them upside down to dry. Whole coffee beans have a bit of grease in them, so they stick to the parts. I didn't do a thorough cleaning each time, so it only took me about 30 seconds.Some other considerations: it is HUGE and will take up quite a bit of countertop space and the grinding process is really loud. I prefer to use the timer, so it grinds when I'm outside of the room. =)Overall, $29.99 is a great price for a gadget that grinds & brews the coffee for you."
1,Bad Design & Didn't Work With 1 hr of Arrival,"I hate grinding beans @ night and setting my coffee maker for the morning (it's a tough life, I know), so I thought this would be the perfect solution -- wrong! It's much harder to clean this unit than it is to take out an old coffee filter. The other problem is that the grinder didn't grind the beans finely enough, so the coffee came out extremely weak. Finally, the unit I purchased ceased working within a day of it arriving -- the on/off switch went kaput. In a way I was relieved since there were so many other things about this unit that I didn't like."
1,Beware this coffee maker!,"I have owned 3 of these coffee makers, because I loved the concept. One was a gift, one I bought and one I was sent as a replacement under warranty. Without exception, the grinder stopped working after about 1 year. Also, the coffee brews EXTREMELY slowly. When you call the company to fix the problem, it is a complete hassle - you are put on hold for a very long time, then told they will call you back. If you do get someone they are rude. I was fortunate to get one of my coffee makers replaced, but when that one broke down, they refused to do anything for me. Big disappointment in the product and the company!"
5,Great coffeemaker,I have used the Cuisiart Auto Grind & Brew for several years. My old one finally bit the dust and I was delighted to find a factory-reconditioned unit for about 1/3 the price of new. It works great. It arrived in like-new condition and I am very pleased with it. I love waking up to the smell of freshly-brewed coffee made from freshly ground beans. It's the best!
4,Works Great BUT minor design flaw,"Great Coffee Maker!But I did read about over flow problem and I did find it :(It is very easy to remedy,when you out the coffee craft make sure the spout is not under the (stop coffee from coming out when I remove the crafe before the coffee is done thingy )It drops into the open spout and stops coffee from coming out and inside over flows.. I guess this is why they were returned in the first place.. Just a minor design flaw..."
4,Groovy old-school Hawaiiana,"This is a nice set of vintage ""hapa-haole"" Hawaiian novelty music from the 1920s. Although it's often listed as a ""various artists"" collection, this is actually almost all by the same artist - Hawaiian expatriate Franck Ferrera, who lived in Europe for much of his professional life (and later headed for the United States, where he played country music as well as island music). There are two tracks by another group, but mostly this is Fererra's show... Which is fine, 'cause it's all fun stuff! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Music Guide)"
3,Meh,It was interesting but i found it very short. It was delightfully creepy though. I had an idea that it was going to be alittle bit darker than what it was.
1,cute but misinformed,"This book is certainly cute. However, it tells the readers that during at lightening storm you should put up your umbrella and huddle under it. This is a dangerous thing for children to see their Sesame Street heros doing because they think everything these heros do is ok. Hiding under an umbrella during a lighting storm puts your life in danger of being electricuted. I was very disappointed in this book. I read it at a Dr.'s office and I requested that they remove it from their book rack."
2,dermafit,"The price was right BUT the quality of the productfalls far below that of tubi-grip.Its' elasticity is much too rigid making it very hardto put it on a body part such as a leg.There should be some instructions as to selecting""sizing""....I would recommend ordering two sizesabove what you might have ordered when using tubi grip."
1,Better than total depravity but still poor,"The quality of the poetry in this book was slightly better than that found in 'Total Depravity', however not good enough to warrant an award of 2 stars.The author seems to have spent most of his time arranging the sentences so that they form the shapes of various cups and vases. In achieving this effect the author removed words that are important to the flow and structure of the poems.The poems had too many religious overtones, which distracted the reader away from the description of the places of interest etc. Whilst most of the religious views contained within these poems are harmless, there were one or two that could cause offence to people of other faiths.Kim's poetry needs to improve a lot if he wants to make it as a top class poet."
4,Well built and decent optical quality,I bought this binocular as alternative for somehow heavy 50x10 Vixen that I owe for some time. In general I am satisfied with the purchase. The quality of materials and build is very good. The two things that I don't like are the neoprene bag which seems too tights (takes time to but bino in properly) and eyepiece caps which are rather deep and tights - OK but not most convenient. The quality of optics is quite good. The only watch out is a relatively narrow field of view but what to expect from such lens diameter. Color and contrast are very good in normal conditions; it gets little bit blurry when pointed against the light. Overall worth the money if you look for something light and portable.
1,Examples are not clear.,I attempted to read through this book but quickly got lost. The examples were incomplete and the accompanying text referred to practically useless examples.I found this book to be quite confusing.I would not recommend this book to any level of reader. A beginner (like me) would be confused and an advanced programmer would already be aware of the techniques. You are better off with online tutorials or other books (e.g. the Visual Quickstart series or perhaps the Flash Hacks book.)
2,Animation and Effects,I read earlier reviews and agree that there is little to be gained from this book that isn't documented in the base tutorials.
4,The arcade classic!,"First of all I am tired of people saying the graphics are pale compared to the Super Nintendo. The SNES won't come out untill late 1991. This game was released in 1989. Sorry had to get that out of my chest, now on to my review. I liked the fact that this game has two more levels than the arcade game. The graphcis are abit pale but another than that I think it is pretty cool. Get this game or buy the Sega Genesis Collection."
5,Streets Of Rage and Streets Of Rage 2 are great!!!!,"Streets Of Rage is an all time beat em up classic.The graphics are great and so is the gameplay.The soundtrack is awesome too.This game...in my opinion is second best,compared to S of R 2.I wasn't all that big into S of R 3 at all.The orginal game blows the third one away.My favorite character that I pick most of the time is Adam.He is sort of slow,but he's got an awesome jump kick.Overall,this game is a classic and a Sega Genesis owner must-have.Buy this along with the second game,but I would avoid part 3...but that's just what I think anyway."
4,Where Is Love,"I did enjoyed Lamb in love. It was a deliously sweet story, even though a bit unrealistic in these days of self centeredness. Where can such love be found, not in our homes, not in our churches, maybe only in between the covers of this book. And perhaps a few hearts of those of us who still can dream."
5,An illuminating book that defies conventional wisdom.,"An essential (and short) book that helps the reader to navigate in some of the present day political and social questions. After defining the nation as ""shared culture"", Gellner explains the marriage of State and culture and its variations over time and place, according to time zones. The crucial discussion is on the link between nationalism and social conditions, and the roots of nationalism in modernity. A couple of chapters on Muslim fundamentalism are also illuminating to understand some of the current debates on the clash of civilizations (see Huntington). A highly recommended book for the scholar and for the active citizen. The major achievement of the book is Gellner's capacity of confuting conventional wisdom on the issue of nationalism."
3,Ok but not inspiring,"On a quest to lose a hundred pounds after breaking a tendon in my foot, I am scrambling for inspiration, and this isn't it. More like a good talk over coffee, it may work for some, but not for me. Try the Amazing Disappearing Critic."
2,"Nice musicianship, didn't like the vocals","Heard about these guys through Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I got the CD. Though the songwriting is above average, I have to say I couldn't get over the nasal quality of the singer's voice on most of the tracks. It's just too piercing for my taste...sorry!"
4,very pleased with the product and the service,This product lives up to its' reputation. I use it as often as I can. The price beat the prices in this area by at least 40%. I would recommend this unit to any one. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,More videos from R.E.M.,"A very nice compilation of songs mainly from Green and a couple from Murmur and Document.The videos are well directed often reflecting the contents of the song despite some very obscure ones, namely orange crush and the rather risque Pop Song '89. All in all, essential for any R.E.M.fan"
3,A Soothing Holiday Read,"This is one to curl up with a cup of hot cocoa and maybe a cat on your lap in the middle of winter. Weatherby's voice has the quality of a mother cooing her baby to sleep, but I mean this in the best possible way. I do not see it as boring and I think that it is the perfect gift for relatives and friends. I recommend other Plains Press titles, such as they can be found. Are there any?"
4,very good,"In only one-volume, this is the best you could get. Sometimes it's boring reading, but overall it's great history."
1,Quite disappointed,"I too bought this book based on the reviews here. It is ""Okay"" for a beginner but not great even at that. There is incorrect information and no data for the published pictures whatsoever - i.e. - exposure, D70 settings, nothing. In the practice picture tutorials in the back, you would need about $15k worth of lenses to duplicate his trials. There are about 6 pages on Picture Project and 3 pages on Capture with most of this being pictures of the screen...horribly inadequate when you are attempting to learn these powerful tools. Also, some of the pictures published were only fair in quality. I returned this book. In my opinion, not worth the paper it is printed on."
2,Basically For Beginners,I bought this book based on the good reviews shown here. I was disappointed when I received it because it is written for the novice photographer. It covers only the basic techniques. I was hoping for a book that gave information on how to get the most out of this camera. If you are a advanced amateur this book is not for you.
4,handyman in oak creek,book was clear and concise. No technical language to get confused. drawings are helpful and well done. swimming pool maintenance and equipment information was extremely helpful.
3,Interesting but not good enough,"This book provides detailed descriptions of US Army uniforms and orders of battle up to 1919, but talks little about the weapons and actions in which the troops were involved.The text doesn't mention anything about the US actions in Arcangel or Vladivostok, the Central-American interventions nor the small actions in North-Africa. Instead, there are brief notes about the campaigns in Mexico, Cuba and China. It is more focused in uniforms and military dress regulations than in historical facts. Art plates are not of the same quality and detail compared with other Osprey M-A-A books. It was not what I expected..."
3,Nice for the price .,"Wasn't expecting much for the $20 I bought this for. Happy that it charges my iPhone 3GS . ( with the USB cable plugged into a pc, not the 110v). The sound quality is not great. Hence the three stars. I'm used to this with Philips products but nonetheless the line level signal from my iPhone has sounded better .For my garage it will do and it hasn't broken yet."
3,Okay but...,"I find it difficult to remember bird songs and bought this CD to see if it would help me learn them. I already have another set of CDs for bird songs and have it loaded on my iPod. I bought this one because I liked the idea of having a phrase to associate with the particular bird song. However, because the format gives you the bird song first and then the name of the bird, I find it very difficult to learn this way. For me, it would be much better if the name of the bird were given both before and after the bird sound is played. Repetition is the key to learning but because there are several bird songs to one track it is not easy to just repeat the bird song you are trying to concentrate on. I think this CD would be even better if the format for each bird were: Bird Name, bird song, phrase to remember the bird song, bird song, phrase to remember the bird song and bird name."
5,First book ever written on this subject and well needed,"This is the world's first book ever written on airline business pland development. The author outlines the true ""elements"" of an airline business plan versus the generic business plan. Anyone interested in starting a big or small company, airline or otherwise, must have this book. Every airline, airport, air cargo operator, consultant, entrepreneur, investor, and enthusiast must have this reference on hand. Excellent work!"
2,waste of money,"this book is best suited to those that have lived under a rock their entire lives and dont know what a business plan is. everyone i know has heard of a business plan, but if you haven't just google it and you'll find as much info as whats in this book. as an aviation business student i bought this book hoping it would help me in my studies. unfortunately the most helpful thing, the mock business plan written by the author, has to be bought separately from the author ""for a nominal fee plus postage"". Dude, i just bought the book, why do i need to buy separately what should be in here!....So, there are no specific examples, very generalised, no blueprint mock business plan. the only thing that was a clear example was the non-disclosure statement... but if you're really starting an airline, you'll probably get a lawyer to write this!"
1,Worst Cold Fusion Book,"I have the 2 Ben Forta books + Mastering CF and CF for Dummies. And this is the worst of the bunch. I would not recommend this for advance developers. This should have been entitled ""Project Management for CF"" not Business Intelligence. I don't need a lecture on project management (which this book focuses). To the publishers - I want techniques for Business Intelligence not Project Management! Thumbs Down!"
4,Time Takes On A New Meaning,"Delia Pitman and Annie Darrow both possess the ability to look into the future however, while Annie lives in the present, Delia lives in the 1800s. With one hundred years between them there is no way the two women could know one another and yet they connect in their minds through their psychic abilities and aid one another is solving a murder as well as preventing their own.Carol Cail has experctly combined the past with the present in ""The Seeds of Time."" Her picture painting description and events of the past make you feel as if you once lived in that era while she keeps the events of the present intacked as well. Whether you believe in the psychic abilities of others or not, if you're looking for a good entertaining mystery this book will not disappoint you."
4,Got what I expected,"This is a nice little concrete driveway cleaner for the price. I live in the country, and get lots of dirt from surrounding fields and trees. It is a slow process, but it works, and is much better than simply trying to use a pressure washer nozzle by itself. If you have a lot of concrete, you may want to step up to a larger professional cleaner, most of which cost a few hundred dollars!"
2,too fast,I have found better examples of chair yoga on youtube - the girl showing the moves is facing you and goes way too fast. Almost impossible to figure out the position you should be in before she goes to another one. I watched it once and probably won't again.
1,Very disappointing,"I really don't understand the great reviews. This DVD is extremely short (25 minutes including an introduction) and poorly executed. Instructions are lacking or ill-timed. Copying the poses, therefore, is not easy because you constantly feel the need to check the screen as there are very few instructions beyond paying attention to your breathing. Having to add another chair for an exercise disrupted flow and was awkward in my small space. Amazon sells many DVD's on chair yoga that are much, much better. Just a few examples are: Angelena's Yoga, Using A Chair, Lakshmi Voelker and Susan Tuttle. This DVD, although pleasantly filmed, does not show the modifications I need in order to participate. All in all a very disappointing purchase. Definitely do not recommend!"
5,only 5 stars? where is 7 or 8,"There is nothing I can say about The Shield that hasn't already been said by all of the other reviewers. This is and continues to be the greatest show on television. I am not going to right a long review like all of the others did. They have said it all. There are just not enough stars for The Shield. I have been hooked from day one and obviously I'm not the only one. Don't look at these reviews and think that this show is like all the others, because it's not. You can't miss The Shield."
5,Just as good as Season 1,"This series just keeps getting better! Saw the season opener and immediately went and ordered season 3 just to make sure I get it in time so I don't have to wait to see what happens! If you liked the first season, nothing changes here!"
3,Be aware of capacity limitations,"People trying to buy this card adapter should be aware of the following capacity limitations, you may notice that for MMC, SM and MS, the adapter is actually useless,- SD (up to 1GB)- MultiMediaCard (up to 128MB)- SmartMedia (up to 128MB)- Memory Stick (up to 128MB)- Memory Stick PRO (up to 1GB)- xD-Picture cards (up to 512MB, none M or H)And the card adapter also has some compatibility problem, it doesnot work with my IBM T42, but OK with my Lenovo T60 and my friend's Toshiba, but this could be a problem of my laptop instead of the adapter itself."
4,Sandisk SD card reader,"Bought this for my wife's laptop so she can read SD cards directly without using the USB cable to her camera. It is simple to install, slips into the PCMCIA slot, and with the SD card inserted it sits flush with the side of the laptop. The only drawback is you can't extract the SD card without removing the reader. (Maybe the fingers of a 5-year old could do it?) Nice quality product."
3,I feel a little unhappy,Because it's complicated take of the memory stick when te card is inside in the laptop
1,Paranoia Will Destroy Ya,"I thought God was love.......what this book is about, is hate....of course its justified hate, but still hate....I thought Michael whooped satans butt a long time ago.....why do some xtians focus on satan so much....god is omnipotent...i think fundies just like striking fear in others.....its their way of drafting followers(justified hate)and giving them some sense of purpose....go practice loving your neighbor rather than finding faults(differences) in him/her..do you think god wants us to be defensive all the time? is that what you think the purpose of life is? i thought it was loving and learning."
4,Great tool just not what i expected.,"When i purchased this item I was thinking it was going to come with the solution needed to clean the bearings. Although it did not come with any solution it came with directions that explained what to use and what not to use. I ended up using alcohol to clean mine and it worked out great. The bottle makes it easy to thoroughly clean the dirt and grime out of a dirty bearing. For anyone looking to buy this item just understand it is only a bottle, no solvent included. Another thing is deont forget to buy speed cream to re lube your bearings after a good cleaning."
5,Two for fast cleanings Picked this,"Picked this up since my kids and I generally hit the local rink twice a week. Son has speed skates, daughter has inlines and I have Quadlines with 100mm wheels.This cleaned the bones bearings installed on all three pairs quickly and easily. It worked so well that I ended up ordering another one to ease the process of cleaning all the bearings. Use 91% iso alcohol to clean then follow up with bones speed cream. Just wish there was a quick easy way to remove and replace the shields since I don't want to run with the bearings open side in."
5,GREAT watch box and tool set,"The box in itself is a great value. The pillows are spaced substancially apart. Enough so you can fit two 50+ mm watches side by side and there will NOT be any contact made. I have many high end watches, tourbillon and meteorite among them, most automatics or mechanical. I am aware of quality better than should be expected. This item is IT!!!The tools in the kit / box are of reasonable quality, and for the price the are also a great value. I will be purchasing another."
4,Revell 57 Vette,"NICE Kit. I got this kit when i was 9, it is very realistic and makes a great addition to any collection..."
2,Great Jokes Too Bad About The plot.,"This book has some great British humor, but the plot let's it down big time. You'd have to be brain dead not to get every clue so NOTHING in this book comes as a fun surprise. I have to admit boring AND humorous is a new mix for me... but I don't want a second helping!"
5,left me begging for more,I was a huge fan of Mil's website and had to get this book. I have read it several times and the laughter comes just as easily the 3rd time as it did the 1st. I was so glad to see it out on Kindle!!
4,Good book,"It's tearing a bit, but that's what happens when one makes a purchase of a used item. Overall, I am satisfied with the purchase."
2,What?,"There are some good songs on this album, but it is definitely not the best of Bob Marley. Go buy Legend."
2,nice bra -- wrong boobs,"the bra was actually not bad other than the shape. I have really round boobs that are full up at the top, so when I put on the bra it squeezed them into a really un-natural position. More like a rocket shape (thin and long not full and round). the material was really soft and the clasp was really easy. The only thing bad was the shape."
1,wrong choice for me,"I measured the rollers I have and they're 1 1/2 inch in diameter. So when I saw these described as 1 1/2 inch I thought I'd found a suitable replacement. But they are a bit smaller which makes a big difference in results. I tried them anyway. They need clips to be secured which is a huge drawback for me. Even with clips, they came loose. I found no positives relating to this product."
5,Just what I wanted,"These rollers curl your hair without damaging your hair. You simply wind your slightly damp or wet hair around the curler and secure with one or sometimes two bobbie pins. Then sit under a bonnet hair dryer for 15 minutes to an hour. Your hair will come out with a beautiful curl or wave depending on the length of your hair and the size of the curler you use. At least that's true for my hair. I've used this type of curler for years. I used to do my homework while waiting for my hair to dry. Now I read. My hair is below my shoulders,is medium thick and has no split ends. One hint! Let your hair cool after it has dried and the curl will be tighter."
5,The greatest controller ever made,"I absolutely love this controller - the d-pad is a little stiff, but the controller seems brand new - so I assume it'll take some time to wear in. This controller is smaller than the original genesis controllers, and i prefer it over the larger ones. It's also very well built. BUY THIS CONTROLLER!"
2,Below Average,"There's many examples throughout the book that constantly use vocabulary that hasn't been taught and concepts that haven't been explained thoroughly. Even when a concept is explained, the examples are somewhat scarce. A real problem with the book is the lack of a spanish-english dictionary in the back from which many many words that are constantly used throughout the book are missing. It has many illustrations that go along with spanish vocab words but are missing the english word! This is not a book to be used without an excellent instructor."
2,Some Colleges Require this Book,"I hate that my son's college is requiring this book along with the Workbook, Answer Key, Dictionary and CD Pkg only read negative reviews. I wonder why the schools would require this expensive and apparently useless package?Thank you for the reviews. Wish the schools would evaluate the package."
1,"Poor research, made-up translations","Based on the Zen principle that ""how you do anything is how you do everything"", I would say this book is primarily invented by the author. I started looking at her ""translations"" of the herb names and was floored by her bogus information. For instance, she says that Calendula in France was called ""souci du jardin"" or, according to Zak ""sauce of the garden""! Souci is a French word for marigold! Souci du jardin simply means garden marigold. She also says that souci du jardin can mean ""sun follower""--completely made up. She has other howlers in the book, mixed in with accurate stuff--my concern is that if some of the writing seems sloppy and improvised, then for something like medicinal herbal information a reader would do better to go to one of the standard publications on herbal medicines and tonics."
4,small and thin,"smaller and thinner than I expected, and there is no picture at all...if with pictures, this will be a great book!"
2,Anti-Federalist Papers - Losers view,It is always important to understand the view of those who lost the debate. This book will help those who wish to understand the argument on the otherside of what we became. There are a number of those who are in Congress who would benefit from understanding why The Federalist Papers is the definitive source for our country's philosophy.
3,"A good, light and amusing read.","Farmer mimicks Vonnegut's style well. This is an entertaining and humourous science-fiction story. It's a light read, easily finished in one sitting (say, a long car ride). The social satire is not so subtle, way too transparent and a bit dated. The alien civilizations visited by the hero aren't very thought-provoking and probably won't satisfy well-read science-fiction fans. Nonetheless, the story works in a crescendo towards a very funny and absorbing ending. The trashiness of the story is intentional, an attempt to write like Trout, it is titillating and amusing, sometimes overdone. It leaves a lingering feeling, a nostalgic sensation like all good books when its finished."
5,"great book, thanks","it was as expected, it is a great book and i have been wanting to own it again for many years, it is going to be an enjoyable read, thanks again"
3,Not clear for beginners,"Though Robert Greiss (of the Monster group fame) has assured me that the proofs and theory in the book are all sound, a beginner would have a difficult time believing it. The proofs generally leave a great deal to be proved, and worse to not point out these short comings so that a reader could at least work them out on the side. I am sure that if one understands representation theory then this is a marvelous reference, but for beginners I prefer Curtis & Reiner's Methods of Representation Theory Volume 1, or even the last section of Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra which is the best explained intro to representation and character theory that I have found."
1,How to buy dead batteries,"I bought these batteries thinking they would be heavy duty for critical applications--in my case for the wireless clip-on lavalier microphones at a wedding. The batteries died after being used for only fifteeen minutes. Since the wedding started a half-hour late, the battereies died fifteen minutes before the wedding started. What a waste."
3,More french pop than Baden Powell,"Powell is a wonderful samba guitarist and there isn't enough by him readiy available, but this is a disappointment. It's loaded up with goopy string arrangements and dreadful french hipster lounge production crap. It's as if you took Bo Diddly and recorded him covering Led Zep hits. The attempt is to make the original sound just like the imitation. It's perverse, and if you enjoy the perverse for its own sake, you might like this a little. If you love Baden Powell you will probably buy this regardless, but i warn you, you'll listen to it once and never again."
2,Didn't add to my knowledge,"This book cannot decide if its supposed to be a coffee table book or be informative. The photo quality is not artistic enough to be a coffee table book, and the information included was sounded more like second hand gossip than as if the authors had actually any knowledge of their subject. Their knowledge of cemetery art was obviously lacking. I also found it annoying that they included so many cemeteries outside New Orleans, when they could have spent more time on the cemeteries within the city."
4,Waxworks and Waxworks 2,"I know these movies are a little campy, but I like them. Especially the different scenes of the wax figures and their different story lines. Hollywood could almost make a movie or series about different scary time-travelers every week. The acting is so-so, this movie is a ""drive-in"" type movie. Waxworks 2 is a little deeper than Waxworks 1, but the story is more involved, and the lead character is the same actor. It doesn't explain a lot of little nuances, but then again, it's not Oscar material.If you want a good semi-scary/ funny movie for a Saturday nite, then these two movies would do it. One more thing, there are a few surprise guest actors in the movies, especially Waxworks 2,like David Carradine (of Kill Bill), and Drew Barrymore, among others."
3,Waxwork?,"I saw the original film ""Waxwork"" and thought it would be interesting to see the sequel;""Waxwork II. What a waste of film in making; the second part of this film. Don't waste the money do the rental way so you can return after watching."
1,Complete imagination - probably,"I have used Bach remedies on myself for some time with questionable results, though I sometimes feel some short-lasting benefit. This book appeared to promise to make it easier to select the required remedies, especially as my symptoms tend to be more psychosomatic than emotional. I have experienced no effect whatsoever from topical application. My physical symptoms to do not in any way seem to cluster in the patterns shown in the book. Also they tend to be symmetrical about the vertical axis of the body, while in most cases the patterns in the book are asymmetrical. My present opinion is that this is a work of pure imagination."
5,Important & Path-breaking work,"Kramer's work of mapping the body by flower types is the most important work since Bach's original book. Infact, you could say that Kramer's work continues Bach's work.Kramer shows that areas of the body respond to particular flowers. For example, the bronchial passage corresponds with Oak, Star & Century. By applying these to the passage you can directly influence the broncial passage.If you then combine superfically corresponding flowers with flowers corresponding to emotinal conditions (Bach's original method), it is possible to come to a full cure; even if previously you had reached a plateau with Bach's original method.Don't miss this one."
4,Fantastic Book On the Use Of Bach Flowers,I believe that all practitioners should add this to their collection on the use of flowers for healing the emotions first. I think that its a simple and direct approach to a much lost art and much needed therapy today. Bravo!
4,Good book for those with little problems,"This book is great for those with no knowledge of how dogs work. Campbell does a great job in explaining what is motivating the behavior of dogs and how to modify that behavior in simple and humane ways. I have a previous general knowledge of animal behavior - and I found the tips, tricks and methods suggested in this book were intuitive and useful. I saw adjustment in my dog's behavior after a few days. The trick with smart dogs is to get your friends to treat the dog in a manner that will assist your training process so they will generalize what they have learned (which is the problem my husband and I are having). A cute smart dog can be a real challenge! I highly suggest getting this book if you have a dog - even if you think you know everything, it's a great read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This author combination has produced a novel of contact with aliens.Humans have spread to the solar system, but are undergoing a bit of aluddite phase.One explorer finds an alien artifact on Jupiter. Returning toEarth, she eventually works out how to operate, after wrestling her waythrough the politics and influence that try and get her out of it,including an old academic overlord.This provokes an aggressive alien response, and professor andex-student must work together to try and do something about it, beforethe planet is blasted."
5,"Good story, great acting.",I always enjoyed reading the Miss Marple stories and I feel that Miss Hickson portrayed her perfectly. It is a good story and good acting by all the cast.
5,Sharp,"These socks are sharp...remind me of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Aside from the fact that they shouldn't have a team, the socks are sharp. Our team wears black jerseys, and these look good w/ them for sure."
3,It said 7+ at Borders...,"It said ages 7+ at borders, and I have to agree, it seemed kind of childish, but if you're looking for something to pass away time, this would be it.I prefer something more like Squee or Johnny the Homicidal maniac in comparison."
4,An evening with this admirable soloist!,"This DVD captures to Mrs. Argerich in absolute plenitude of her overpowered gifts with a variegated program.Alexander Rabinovitch demonstrates his persuasive temperament as conductor, making a terrific version about Prokoviev's Classical Symphony Op. 25.Then, soloist and orchestra performed an electrifying version of Prokoviev's First Piano Concerto, filled and hovered of that mercurial display of eruptive fierceness and sheer lyricism.Then came the performance of Schumann's Violin Sonata, frank, honest, virile and incisive without romantic meanderings.The jewel of the crown turned around the magisterial performance about Beethoven's Triple Concerto. Interpretative solvency and remarkable exhibition of noblesse and expressiveness.If you want to give yourself a deserved gift or in case you want to give a musical gift to a beloved person, don't think it over and go for this one."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Not a heavy, professional grade juicer. Wobbly fittings. I'm afraid if I apply too much pressure, something will bend. Amazon sells this under a variety of names. Mine reads Prime Cookware Citrus Juicer PPD50J. Made in China."
5,WWWWAAAAYYYY CCCCOOOOOOOOLLLL,THIS ROCKS! I'M NOT JOKING! IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH EVERYONE ELSE AND HIGHER!
4,Great ideas for interesting interiors,Love the variety of upscale interiors selected for this one. Photography is quite good.
4,good deal,I was very satisfied with this flag the price was under 5$ and the material was a little thin but i bought it for inside not outside so it worked great i had actually bought a flag almost identical for over $50 so overall i think it was a great buy.
3,OK FLAG,"I was really looking forward to receiving this flag because I really wanted it, but when I got it, I was not completely satisfied. The flag is new, yet the colors are a bit faded, especially the red, and for anyone that actually knows the design of the flag, this one does not have the coat of arms to the left as almost all Costa Rican flags though. It is a civil flag. Nevertheless, good price and pretty good flag for INDOORS."
1,Very poor game.,The gameplay is rubbish and the fun is absolute zero. Mildy cute graphics that were dated at the time and totally redundant now. It does not show off what the Genesis was capable of and is surely one of the worst platformers ever. Don't even buy out of morbid curiousity.
3,Kinda fun to read,"I was stationed in Turkey and didnt have a lot to do, so I bought this book for fun. Helped pass the time."
4,its a good software,"its a good software, it works good and keep the computer safe from spam, virus, and some others malware, try it."
1,It is okay but...,I have decided that it is much more comfortable and looks better just to bite the bullet and buy a bigger shirt. The extenders just didn't work for me.
5,With All That I Am,"This CD is so refreshing. Carol Duboc's voice is sexy and soothing. I love the jazzy soulful feel of the music and the live instruments. The whole CD is entertaining because the songs are wonderful and no two songs sound alike. My favorite songs are ""My Inspiration"", ""2nd Nature"" and ""With All That I Am"". Carol Duboc is such a great writer, it is nice to hear a whole CD of songs written by the artist. It makes the listening experience much more intimate. I can't wait to see her in concert. Being a fan of Hubert Laws and Gerald Albright, it was great to hear them add their special performances to this already fabulous CD. I highly recommend this CD to jazz lovers as well as people who like sophisticated R&B music... LOVE IT! LOVE IT!"
2,Picture quality lacking,"I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros. The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor.FYI - I'm using a PSP as my viewer."
3,Fun but not great video,"This is a cool little item and I was hoping that the video would be at least VCR quality. Unfortunately, it's not as good as even my 20 year old VCR. It is usable but a bit of a disappointment. I'm just glad that it was so cheap."
2,Can't get it to play properly on my Treo,"After recording a TV show and inserted the card into my Treo 700p, there was no program on the Treo that would play the show. SanDisk customer service did not respond when I inquired about what program would play the show. I found some freeware, Core Media player, and loaded it on the Treo. This allowed me to see the video, but the sound was choppy and couldn't listen to it. I went back to customer support, still no response. It's going back unless there is a program to view/listen on my Treo."
3,Gets the job done.,"This product is meant for a portable device, however I am using it to replace my VCR which died. It records, but the quality is poor, but for $25.00 you get what you pay for. And yes, the remote sucks."
2,Doesn't work as well as the Neuros,"There's a reason this is $30 cheaper than the Neuros MPEG4 Recorder 2 Plus -- it doesn't work as well.I originally tried to save a few bucks and grabbed a V-Mate, but it went back after every recording had a squiggly white line on the top of the image and the quality just wasn't up to snuff. Upgraded to the Neuros and have been VERY happy."
2,Video is as bad as indicated,Purchased to look at short low quality video clips. The device seems like it will do that but the image quality on a 20inch TV is horrible. On my 2.4inch screen it is just fine. Don't even think of buying this if you want to look at the video on a bigger than 12inch screen.System will pass through the video for your source so it is very easy to use. takes some getting used to the remote. there are no button on the device so do not lose the remote.
2,Recording quality ok.. but no 640x480 preview!!!,"Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations."
3,Takes a little work,"I bought this device to convert some VHS tapes I need for class into digital, and then play them back on my iPod. The device works as advertised. I do wish it had an iPod preset, but the PSP format works ok. The user interface is easy and direct. There have been complaints about the remote and some of those are valid. The small remote is difficult and seems to have a very short range. Once I find the sweet spot, it works fine. Other sites have suggested replacing the battery in the remote and cleaning the optics to resolve this and I will try that. I have not used the IR emitter since it is not needed for my application. This is a very inexpensive device and it does the job. Don't expect too much and you will be satisfied."
1,Don't Work!,"I received the item from them on time but only a couple of weeks after getting it, it stopped working. I had only used it once."
1,not good,first off the battery was dead when I received it. very confusing to work. If you unplug it you have to reset the clock. Has to playback in quicktime only. it sux
5,profound yet true,"when i read this book, i was stunned, i literally had no words. it gave me look into something i had never seen before: an abortion. although this book goes into graphic detail about an abortion, i believe its a good thing. this book was a basis for me on how to judge if my relationships were constructive and it taught me that feelings often supercede what we know to be right. i would hightly recommend this book for everyone over the age of 13."
1,You get what pay for - piece of ****,"I bought this as a CHEAP vest for the occasional HOT ride. Patches are so chintzy I took them off and they covered up up defects and tears. Rips like tissue, don't know what kind of buffalo leather, maybe 'rabbit'.I'd send it back but would cost more than it's worth.Save your money and get something better."
2,There will be blood...,"... In fact a lethal overdose of blood.How could I not love this movie? Gladiator was one of my all-time favourites, I love Braveheart, and Apocalypto IS still my favourite, so how can I not love this one? Shallow is the magic word. This movie tries to live off its shock value. The gore is presented with gay abandon almost as if it were the main focus point of the film. And maybe it is, I don't know, didn't care to finish it.The frustrating thing is the setting has great potential. Romans are fighting some rebellious tribes in the far north of Britain. You gotta love rebels. Except this movie shows things from the Romans' perspective, which is a let-down, but the deal-breaking flaw is that flying body parts rule the screen, except the heart is missing.3 out of 10 just for the potential."
3,I expected a Roman bloodbath...,"...and got a Roman bloodbath. A star for battle scenes that put the fear of war in a person. A star for the main ""villian"" not making wise-cracks before finishing off her victims. Of course she had no tongue, but, still... And yes, a 3rd star for the beautiful scenery when it wasn't blood-soaked. I'd give it another 1/2 star for Mickey the idiot (Noel Clarke), because I enjoy Doctor Who also. The details of the story held it back from a fourth star. Became very much like a muddled American western. Very much. Still, it was as expected. Enjoy."
3,Mediocre film,"Story was trite and predictable; characters were not well developed, at least, other than a single scene in a cave where the survivors talk about their past; the action scenes were fair, but that's not saying much, is it, in an action film; if I'd paid $10 or $12, to see this in a theater I'd be pretty upset; as it is, I'm only mildly disappointed."
2,Lame,After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising. It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing. It's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running. There's really not much of a plot. If you're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives. This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short. Don't waste your money.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'd never heard of this movie until my cousin rented it, and wasn't really expecting much from it, but I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day. The scenery alone is just... beyond words. It's so beautiful. I'd never heard of Michael Fassbender before, but he really carried this movie. Not to say the other actors weren't spot-on as well, because I don't remember a bad acting job in the whole movie, but he definitely has a leading presence and it's understandable that he becomes the de facto leader of the small band of survivors. I did have to look away at certain parts because of the blood, but I'm a bit squeamish about that. I really enjoyed the little bit of romance that was in it, as well. I actually wouldn't have minded a bit more. What can I say? I'm a girl."
3,C+,"This could have been a B+ but it was so violent, it started to get comical. Why does Hollywood do this? They get a good topic with great cimatography and ruin it with excessive cheap sensationalism. I give this movie a C+."
2,Not what I signed up for..,Centurion made no attempt to be historically correct. It gave the impression of a ancient roman movie then it went mid evil and who knows what else..Some of the dialogue was from today time....Other than the killing (action) help me understand what was good about this movie..
5,Once we were warriors...,"AS a scholar of ancient history and ""Matre d'armes"" of a living history society (ancientbattlessociety.com), I really appreciate epic movie, especially when not Hollywood made. The script reveals itself strongly written so naturally the story flows. The characters, the art and the props tend to stay quite true to the based facts of history. Enjoy a very good movie...Andria"
4,"Gre Brouwenstein , a hidden gem","Being Dutch I always was a admirer of Gre Brouwenstein, she is a much underrated singer I think.I was very curious about this performance, for her Elisabeth de Valois was always a starrole for hereWonderful, of course old tapes, but clear and well forward, I'm very happy with this CD!"
3,Like Jason products but ....,"I was hoping to replace the Meditation Mask that Jason made up until recently. This 'masque' is not a replacement for it and is for someone with oilier skin than mine. Good product but not for normal skin or routine, daily use. Jason uses good ingredients and that is what I like...so I recommend this but not for normal to dry skin."
2,Meh,"Er.... yeah these don't really make braids. It should be called a ""quick twisting kit"" or something. lolNot so great.... I tried it a couple times and never got it to work well. Either way, they don't make braids, so it's really not a very good product, is it?"
3,chronology,This book takes place after the movie Nemesis and before the book Star Trek: Titan: Taking Wing. Following the first Titan book is Articles of the Federation.
1,Very bad experience,Buying at TimeZone 123 has been a bad experience. I got but the deficient and inflexible support from the company in its return policy. I have had a hard time trying to negotiate a fair return solution for an already paid damaged watch I received with my purchase order. Now I have a debit in my card an useless defective watch and bad customer service experience.
4,Examples are very good,This second-edition is very good...provides excellent coverageof all JSP topics. The examples are VERY helpful. (I also usethe free Tomcat V4.x application-server to host the bookexamples and example code that I've developed.)
5,Current viewpoints,"Information is reasonably current. Many on this subject contain only the info from ""the-day"". Vizard knows of what he speaks. Real dyno info, real race experience. Applies to later BMC B just as well. Quite different views on head porting than Burgess."
1,Still waiting for this book,Well it has now passed a month since buying this book on Dec 14 and has still not arrived!Ok it has been holidays so I really hope it will arrive soon./Peter
5,controler,well this wasn't a game i don't know why they asked me those questions but i took them did them so that i could review the controller it work right and also it was delivered to me fast.
3,Bland but effective profile of classical age history.,"Useful collection of maps tracing the history of the classical {i.e. the Mediterranean} world from 1400BCE thru 565CE. The maps are strictly pragmatic in design and layout, optimized for integrating as much poltical/cultural/economic information as possible in the presentation of each plate. A comprehensive index of ancient place names cross referenced with their modern equivalents greatly enhances the volumes research utility. Most definitely not a coffee table book with richly drawn relief maps, this is nevertheless a handy research tool for a student of history."
1,Item not as shown,"The cable as shown appears to be about 6 inches long. This length is perfect for cars which have console AV outlets for IPODs or other players. There is no language in the technical information which identifies the length of the cable. The item also states it is shipped from PriceTwin.The item I received is 6 FEET long, more expensive than the same item from Walmart, and was shipped by Product Warehouse. The invoice contains NO phone number so I can't even call to discuss what happened.I am very displeased. I have just spent $17+ for an item that is not what I thought I was ordering."
5,Great,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is simple, lighthearted and easy to read, yet says so much. The suggestions in this book bring us back to basics and center our souls. Sark writes about women and how to support ourselves and each other - emotionally not financially. I recommend this book for all women."
5,Succulence abounds,"I recently read this book while on vacation. I had epiphany after epiphany while consuming the knowledge SARK brought forth. She has wisdom, humor, honesty, and humility. I could identify with so much of what she spoke of in her history and felt comforted by the fact that she was able to speak of it so openly. I came home a different woman."
2,Quality Service --->>> upgrade to 5 stars,"The first spayer had problems, but they replaced it with no hassels. The second one works well if I charge it over night. It's a terrific hand saver when one must do a lot of spaying. I use if for my home & office cleaning business. If you use it a lot, buy two so you can keep one charging while you use the other."
1,Howling,I have not received the title.Redwood entertainment from which I purchased the item lied to me on 2 occasions that they mailed the item and they did not
5,Great book!,"This was a great book that kept me glued to the last page. I really enjoyed the travels of the young ""hero"", on his way through ""Fear"" county. I thought this book was great and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good horror story."
4,Excellent book. Kept me on the edge of my seat.,The writer has a wonderful working knowledge of the Tennessee rural community that he writes about. I was impressed that he wrote such believable fiction about a legend that came to life.
1,More scary and haunting then King in my opinion,"I picked it up at the airport not expecting much, but was I surprised!As another editorial stated, the first 1/2 (I think the first 1/4) was run of the mill monster story, but as the story unfolded, I could not put it down. I was hoping for delays just so I can turn the page.The imagary and immagination are frightful and make for a whopping scary tale. Who would have thought Tennessee could be the background for a truly scary book?It was also fun to read through the backwoods jargon. Though the book was a page turner, it was also quite an accomplishment he was able to switch between pretty nice writing and backwoods hillbilly lingo. Ain't no thang.Loved it."
1,stay away from Ronald Kelly!,"RK's got to be the worst writer in horror i've ever read. his descriptions are so obvious. i know you can't use that word about descriptions, but in this case you can. you can actually see the descriptions coming. a monster hunting. yes, and...? it attacks? yes, i guessed as much. no, that seems to be it. RK introduces some characters we are supposed to feel sorry for. and he describes how they are outcasts, etc. i was waiting for the story to develop. but that seemed to be the story. how much a pityit was. so sad. they were not tolerated. it's not even written well, and it has nothing to do with horror. i've read another book by RK too. exactly the same stuff!"
4,"So far, so good !","I originally had reservations on purchasing software. I spoke with a few people at the local electronic retailers and was told that the software should work in my system. I purchased a Dell Dimension 4600, about 2 months ago. 512 RAM, XP Standard. when i launch the program i get an error message that it is unable to find some kind of local file, but this does not seem to hinder my use. I need to brush up on my Math, so that I can prepare for the 1st Actuarial Exam. I will start at Pre-Alg, and work my way up to the Calculus, then I will rely on books by Howard Anton. I do not have time to enroll in a class either online or in person, so I am hoping the software will help rebuild the necessary foundation to continue further.I was able to knock out the Pre-Alg and Alg 1 in one day. ran thru the tutorial, and did the quiz and examinations for both and no problems with running. I will give another review when i have completed Calculus. keeping my fingers crossed."
3,Just some comment,"I just have some comment about the previous couple of posts. I actually donot have this software but find this page through google on ""Director Player 6.0 3MB of free virtual memory"" for a possible fix on a different product. I think direct player is a macromedia product and they didn't get updated for calculating GB correctly.Here is the url http://www.truenorthentertainment.com/html/flytying/fly_support.htmMacromedia probably should patch this up. It's not very responsible to ask another person to fix the problem when it is really yours."
2,Bo-oring!,"Back in 1993 Sega released a dull, lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time. Quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better.It isn't. It's a slow, boring game.You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or...a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army guys (just what are they doing in the game)? And why a Raptor be killing other Raptors? Weird.Obviously not learning from their first mistake Sega really dropped the ball on this so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, sluggish and dullest platformers I have ever played."
4,TOM TOM european map,"IF you purchase the Tom-Tom with a US map and afterwards purchase the European map card, you will find that it is not a plug and play simple activation process. The card is not recognized and requires an expert to down load SW from Tom-Tom web and store on the new card.Once it is working. It is a nice and simple to operate GPS."
1,Does not work,Tried to install on my GO510 and it was not compatable. Company has been helpful and is accepting the product back for full refund.
4,Miracles are Here,This is an inspiring book which points to the idea of an age of miracles. I would suggest reading LightShift 2000 (also available from amazon)-- which is perfect evidence in tangible reality of precisely what Nick Bunich is talking about....a true miracle in the process of manifestation.
1,slow,very slow why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is slow. strange.
2,not as good as my CRT,"I was given this monitor at work to replace a Viewsonic CRT, and I have to say it's not as good.My biggest problem is that it's too bright. I work in a dim environment, and when I turned the monitor down to brightness=0, my eyes still feel fatigue.I also have been unable to adjust the gamma because I can't turn down the brightness enough.Further, when you move your head from side to side, parts of the screen look more and less yellow. (this doesn't happen on other LCDs/laptops I've used).Maybe on a budget this is great, but since I stare at the screen for 9 hours a day, and I'm probably hypercritical, this LCD is not the best choice.When I finally break down and buy an LCD for myself, at home, I know I will have to test it in person."
1,Not working - bad investment,"So far I have been totally disappointed in this product. The printer worked long enough to print out a less than good test page but made a lot of noise during the process and it has not printed another page since. When I contacted the seller, Delnero Computer Sales, David assured me on January 24 that I could get a replacement for the broken printer I received but because I was going on vacation I requested they wait to send it after I got back on Feb 6. I've been home since Feb 6 and have not heard anything further as to if or when they sent the replacement printer and I am still waiting as of today, Feb 12, 2012. I had one just like it that lasted for several years so I know what it is capable of doing if I could just get one that works."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a huge Paul Potts fan and, after seeing him live, was very excited about a DVD. The first disappointment was that the desciption for the DVD states a 55 minute running time, when it is actually only 22 minutes. The second disappointment was that in that 22 minutes, it repeats some footage and is basically the same song over and over. Spend your money more wisely and purchase his audio CDs."
1,Ed Wood does educational videos,"I received this movie to use in a community college class on American Government. I could not use it. The movie does not make sense, does not explain the electoral college and is poorly edited and produced. The narrator has an east coast accent that is difficult to understand, the film footage is stock footage of any political or historical event and is thrown together in a way that makes no sense and confuses the viewer. This film very much reminds me of a short Ed Wood movie. The film starts out talking about the electoral college, but then skips to Article II of the Constitution (for no apparent reason) and then goes on to talk about Nixon. All in all this is the worst 30 minute movie I have even seen."
1,Crap,"I bought this album purely because it has Kool Keiths name on it, what a mistake besides the Reverand Tom intro the album is garbage.Keith isnt on 2/3rds of the album. And my white sister could rhyme better than the chick on this album. Just stay away, if you want some decent worth while Kool Keith check out, Dr Dooom, Octo, Diesel Truckers or Black Elvis."
4,Very informative book,"This book is filled with all the info you could want on artificial lures. I would strongly suggest it for anyone interested in furthering their knowledge on the subject. Many, many photos are included to help identify the lures."
4,good but a hugely depressing tale...,"I absolutely adore most everything written by Brenda Joyce...but I must say, while this was a good book...it is probably the most depressing angst-ridden book I have ever read.While there is romance, it is dark, and filled with tragedy, betrayal, incest and countless other downers that by the end left me feeling completely wrung out.The only bright spot in this tale was the young blind Hannah.If you are in the mood for a tale that is at once gripping and nauseatingly cruel...this one is for you...."
1,This is a bad book and this is why...!,"This book is just a show off book showing mostly the main author papers!!A fundamental book is supposed to be a wide scope book with a great dealof structured chapters each of which with a detailed application examples.I do not recommend it to any body. If someone is interested on CMOS imagingfor grad studies or to have a deep understanding on this field (and CCD's),I recommend this bookImage Sensors and Signal Processing for Digital Still Cameras...Good Luck"
1,I returned this item & I don't know why it is asking for a shipment again.,"I returned this item once, and if I have to I will do it again. I don't understand why Amazon is ""selling"" me this a second time."
4,Beautiful book which bought back happy memories.,I bought this book 2 years after my first trip to Bali when I stayed at the Honeymoon Guesthouse and was lucky enough to briefly meet Janet during a yoga retreat. The book describes beautiful Ubud and the Balinese culture so well and also generously gives many delicious recipes of the Balinese cuisine Thank you Janet for telling your story.
5,Something for Everyone - Enchanting and Interesing,"Welcome to the world of ancient world of witchcraft that was true and not what so many people see it as today. Furlong has created a place of magic from the land of the druids. Taken in by the town witch whom everyone in the village suspicious of, but does not get rid of because she cures their ills after her cousins give her up. Now considered an orphan, the spoiled Wise Child learns much about life and her future from the slightly omniscient Juniper, her witch-teacher who teaches her to read books, the stars, and people. But when temptation of a better life lures the young girl away, she is forced to choose between a woman who has become her best friend and the mother who gave her up long year ago.Deep and beautiful, enchanting and full of stirring thoughts and passageways into an ancient cutlture, you won't want to put this book down. Five stars because there is nothing that compares to this book. -Lia"
3,Product deteriorates too fast,"I was SO HAPPY that this was available online at Amazon. I was highly upset that the Lens that came with my Range Hood started to disintegrate. When I was growing up years ago, these things didn't disintegrate. BUT... it's a low cost item and I was thrilled that when I finally tried to buy one at Lowe's (where I got the Range & Hood) they could give me information and the EASIEST PLACE to purchase this and the grease filter screen for my Hood are available through Amazon."
5,Wide Variety,"Like another reader I too found this book at my local library. After looking through quite a few bread machine books there I brought this one home. Though it does lack pictures, the taste of the great breads I made from it more than made up for my initial disappointment at not seeing what the finished product should look like. I highly recommend both the golden wheat bread and the multigrain bread. My kids loved the golden wheat and my husband and I liked the multigrain. Because of the wide variety of recipes included in the book there are many more I'd like to try. Guess I'll just have to buy the book!"
2,Ruins the fantasy world,"Why would the Strawberry Shortcake friends have to take a school bus and be on a field trip to pick apples? In their other adventures, they manage to do all sorts of things on their own (unrealistically, sure), but suddenly they need the assistance of school to learn that apples grow from seeds!I just don't understand why fantasy-killing school should even be involved in this story. It makes it much less fun when the kids have to have a ""buddy"". My daughters and I always enjoyed Strawberry Shortcake for its fun, fantastical world."
5,Excellent book,Quick easy read but so so good. Excellent for anyone facing hard times and trials in life. Would highly reccommend.
1,Where is the list of episodes on this DVD?,"Wouldn't buy because the list of episodes on the DVD is not listed in description. The link to IMDB is no longer any good and when I did a seach there, it told me absolutely nothing about what episodes are on this. Can someone list the lost episodes on Volume 3 if you get a moment?"
4,it's beatiful but a little slow,"Vista premium .....mmmm, I'd stick to the old windows like XP or 2000, it makes most of the desktops or laptops slow."
4,A historical wonder!,"Excellent read. This story flies with detailed and artistic storytelling. I couldn't wait to get through it, and was disappointed when it was over!"
3,Questionable,"I am not sure this style is for everyone. I am trying to get strong which requires heavy weight and low reps. I think using ""high intensity"" training will cause you to burn out before you build up. This method can take you only so far. Then you will have to change your workout plan."
5,High-Intensity Training,"Coach Philbin's professional reputation caused me to try a block of personal training sessions with him. But I was a little apprehensive. So I read his book during the first two weeks of training. The ability to understand his philosophy and approach proved invaluable. I was able to develop a comfort level with the quality of his program. Some fifty training sessions later it is apparent that the book accurately captures Coach's intensity, expertise and dedication. If you can't train with him personally - train with the book in your gym bag."
2,Color is terrible,"Very simply put, the color is terrible, but it does work and the picture is very clear. Just not satisfied with the color, but the price was right."
1,Not That Good!,"The light is not bright enought, cannot see things too well in the dark, I only used this light for few times, after that, I can't turn it back on anymore! I tried to change the battery, still doesn't work.... I won't buy another one to replace into my baton."
5,A Fascinating Thought-provoking Read,"I like a book that pushes the envelope - especially when it comes to health. ""We Want to Live"" pushes the envelope.No more wasted spending on vitamins, ""cholesterol-lowering"" drugs, and RX-happy physicians. This book follows up on Hippocrates's advice, ""Let food be your medicine.""Breal free from conventional ""wisdom."" Read this book."
5,gets the smoke out,There's a smoker in the house so instead of her going outdoors in the winter I installed this in the den. It does such a good job you wouldn't know there was a smoker
1,Piece of Junk,"Got it brand new, one fan worked well, the other barely turns. What a piece of junk, not worth it!!"
4,Good cozy,"One in the series of the Camden Su Mer senior citizens cozy mysteries--worth a read, easy and fun"
4,falsetto to the rescue,"Most will know this one by the Full Intention mixes that are included, that's the giant house hit that clubs had been playing non-stop. Total commercial house with a fabulous percolating bassline. Included are also some very charming Pizzaman mixes that sound almost like 70s music (think WAR's ""Lowrider""). Funny because Pizzaman's stuff used to be so trance-euro. It's actually a good listen."
4,FAST!!!! But battery doesn't last too long.......,Way better choice than a Toy's R Us or Radio Shack piece of junk. This is built solid and is a blast to play with (and I'm a grown adult!). My 6 year old is probably a year or two too young for this right now but he has fun with it nevertheless - probably a great gift for an eight to twelve year old
3,"Nice product, Poor description.","I guess I was expecting a little more of a device charger for the price. First off, the actual item doesn't look like the picture. For a Gigabeat, that's a huge problem because the charging port is on the side. Gomadic's ""Tip Exchange"" makes the problem even worse because now you have about 3 inches of solid plug and adapter sticking 90 deg out of the side of the unit. This makes it awkward to store in a console or glove box. It will charge the unit with a completely dead battery - which the USB charger won't do, and it has an overcharge protection that is nice. Provide a 90 deg bend adapter and an actual picture of the product and I would give it a 5 star rating."
3,"Evolving, experimenting, lacking","To tell you the truth, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this album. I think it's a step back in terms of quality songs from Double Allergic, but its experimentation in styles and sound suggests the quality of things to come. It's a transition album to say the least, but if you're going to buy only 3 Finger's albums I would this wouldn't be one of them. Highlights include Hindley Street and Passenger. Basically, for hard core Fingers fans."
5,The Aussies are right about this one,I bought this CD on a recent trip to Sydney and I'm very glad I did -- a solid album all the way through. It's only a matter of time before this band makes it big on this side of the Pacific.
4,Maxfire pro - good bang for the buck,"This product is about what you would expect. It's a small and portable gamepad for your laptop - it works well with emulators and is plug and play with microsoft operatings systems.I do agree with some other reviewers that the analog stick could use some more work. It's not a smooth slide from left to right, there is definately some friction due to mechanical griding. Directly under the stick (the top of which can be popped off) there is a paper disc that keeps dust from getting inside the gamepad. I removed it and it appeared to help with the motion of the analog nub.Overall I cant complain, it does exactly what I want it to and was very inexpensive."
2,not built to last,"Worked for a while on gametap games.......a month after purchase, the cord died then a month after that the controller is drifting left uncontrollably.Great size for travel and for my 4 year old.Boo!"
4,"Nice, But Missing Something","This is a good product, but being that i am a old school Sony product user the one feature that i really miss on their new dvd/cd players is RANDOM PLAY MODE come on, would it have cost Sony a whole lot of money to include this feature on this latest dvd/cd players 5 dics models instead i had to buy the 300 Mega Storage model to get this feature, but what about those of us who still like the 5 disc carousel model with random play? have we been kicked to the curb.? I mean come on a player without random play is like Popcorn without the butter something is missing badly missing. So if you guys at Sony read this please put this back in your players O'RANDOM PLAY WHERE FORTH ART THOU?Ted"
2,Fair only.,Ok up converting dvd player. Its attached via HDMI video but i think my xbox 360 does a better job! Also tray sticks. Needs an additional pull 1 time in 5 to come all the way out for loading and unloading. Sony has really fallen off as far as build quality goes.4-4-2012 update. Crap. 4 years old and tray will no longer come out without much assistance . Sorry I brought a Sony. Good thing is I learned my lesson. This was my last Sony purchase.
2,Does NOT do SA-CD!,"Contrary to the amazon item listing title, this player does NOT do SACD, as far as I can tell. There is no mention of it in the manual (or the product description) and there are no analog outputs out the back of the player, as you'd expect. It's POSSIBLE that the SACD surround sound is being sent out over the HDMI connection, but I doubt it.I guess SACD is yet another Sony system that they've thrown over. Remember Beta? Minidiscs? Sheesh."
2,Short lived X 2,"I'm done with Sony DVD players. I had the first 5 disc DVD player from Sony and it lasted 2 yrs, then it stopped reading discs. Great while it lasted but I expect more from Sony especially with the light use the player gets. But I figured it was a fluke and didn't see many alternatives for the 5 disc type so I bought another one last year. It's been 14 months and I probably watched 20 DVD's at most, and it just stopped reading movies. I have a media center PC so I only use this DVD when I have a multipart movie to watch and still it died. So another black box goes to the landfill. First one was $170, Second one was $120, now they're about $80... still not worth a year of service."
