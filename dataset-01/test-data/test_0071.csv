1,"Number Zero, This One","I think ""Love Potion #9"" is a cute little song, and I liked Sandra Bullock before. What should have added up to a nice little movie was definitely a zero. Vulgar and stupid. Really, I mean it. Stick to the oldies radio station and think up your own movie plot--I'm sure you'd do a whole lot better."
1,The worst Stevie Nicks Album ever,"I have been an avid Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks fan for many years. I own every album put out by FM and SN. I also own the DVD of Fleetwood Mac's ""The Dance"" and VHS ""Tango in the Night"" and I own the Stevie Nicks DVD ""Live at Red Rocks"".This new album ""Trouble in Shangri-La"" is well named. I get the impression this album was put together over a weekend. It is not the ""professional quality"" I have come to expect. Sorry Stevie, that's one fan's opinion.Bernard L. Fioravanti"
2,If only Stevie had a better band...,"Here are 13 new songs, but unfortunately they mostly sound the same. I wish Stevie had a more inspired set of band members to accompany her. They just don't give her much to work with. There are not many musicians in the world that can write the lyrics, sing the songs and compose the music and come up with a great CD. Stevie isn't a one-person band and this CD relies too much on her voice to keep your attention. The band just stays in the background and adds nothing to Stevie's effort. The result is a repetitive and a lackluster CD."
2,"Save your money on this one, try and get it for free","I give this album only two stars for Trouble In Shang-ri-la"" & ""Planets of the Universe"", these songs are great. I found the songs to be repetitive and not up to par with early Nick's work. If you can get it for free save your money and buy something else."
3,"DON'T WASTE TIME READING, BUY THIS ALBUM!","The one we've all been waiting for. If you like Stevie just a bit or if she's your hero of life, you will NOT regret buying this album. Stevie rocks...10-08-2012 Edit - years later: While I was excited about this album when it first came out -see my skewed review above- it has not stood up to the test of time as have previous albums from Stevie. In fact, being brutally honest with myself, this is my least favorite album by Ms. Nicks. The newer ""In Your Dreams"" is a far superior album and much less ""over-produced"".This is not to say I don't like ""Trouble"" just that it's not the be-all, end-all of Stevie's music. Stars adjusted accordingly."
3,"Some good, some forgetable","Maybe it's just me but after listening to this CD, I felt as if it could have been so much more. Stevie Nicks still has the vocal power and finesse to turn even the most average song into something special. Recommended for those who just love her voice. Otherwise it's nothing spectacular."
4,A brave voice 4.5,"Having visited Turks & Caicos a few times I figured it was time to read this book. The vision brought to light, by the brave voice of Mary Prince, is real.Born in Bermuda, Mary traveled to and fro across the caribbean in search of her freedom. Her story takes you through beatings, hangings by the wrist for such a minimal incident, and working the days from 4:00 in the morning until 9:00 at night. The story continues through to her final escape to the refuse of Mr. Thomas Pringle.Thomas Pringle was a member of the Anti-Slavery movement. He assisted Mary Prince in her freedom and with getting her story down on paper for all to see.Highly Recommend."
2,"Too much explaination, not enough tools...","This book is not really bad, it just doesn't say much. You don't really walk away with good, solid tools you can use to improve your life. You finish the book thinking, ""That was interesting."" Big deal! If I spend money on a book, I want a little more than something interesting. It suffers from the same defect most therapists suffer from: Too much emphasis on explaining the problem, not enough emphasis on what can be effectively done about it. Too much emphasis on the past, not enough emphasis on the future.Better tools can be found in books like How to Win Friends, and a new one I just bought by Adam Khan called Self-Help Stuff That Works (Youme Works; ISBN: 0962465674)"
3,Broke after 18 months,I have two of these units. The first has broken after 18 months. I have sent it back to a Yamaha repair center and the cost to repair is as much (or more) than a factory new unit. It was not used heavily for the time that I have had it... But I AM going to buy another one.... I am a brand loyal type all of my stuff is Yamaha brand.... Looking at some Thiel speakers though..
3,good for light spots!,"when I purchased this product I was using it as directed, I applied it two times a day for over 2 1/2 months. My results were barely noticeable, the darkest spots on my skin were hardly lightened but I did see a difference in some of the lighter spots. I eventually cut down on using it everyday and use it on occasions now. All in all I think this product works best for ''light'' hyper-pigmentation spots.ADVICE- Do not use this product with benzoyl peroxide or hydrogen peroxide ''they will react with each other causing skin irritation and discoloration.''"
1,it made my face worse !,I dont know how but this product actually made me darker.And my face broke out like crazy. But I'm not allergic to any of the ingredients.I'll Just have to buy a natural product one WITHOUT hydroquinone.
2,Ambi Fade Cream,Starting using 3 months ago.... on just 2 dark spots on my face... have not seen much improvement.Its thick and I dont like the way it makes my face feel....(my age 62) I am medium complexion.
3,Eh,"To me, it looks nothing like Mike tysonTo my nephew, who the gift was for, adores this toy like his other figures"
2,Disappointed but,"it was a great attempt for an unknown. After reading the reviews, I ordered this book. A few of the chapters were good but on the whole it was a disappointment. I could not recommend this book without feeling guilty."
5,"One book is not enough, I'm waiting for Part 2","This book will make you cry with laughter. Ed says what everyone else is thinking. This book is to be read and reread. A forever classic of southern literature. Ed Williams is an author on the rise, watch for him."
1,Impossible to watch in Australia,Unfortunately I couldn't watch my favourite movie because apparently a DVD from the UK wouldn't work in an Australian DVD player. Maybe Amazon could mention these details before the sale occurs.
4,Very Basic,"I think this is a fine book. I bought it expecting a list of things that my child should know prior to entering Kindergarten. Instead what I got was a book that I could use to teach my child. Excellent!I think it would be better with a comprehensive list of expectations and/or goals that every child should reach by the time they are through with Kindergarten. That is the teacher in my coming out.I found that the social studies section was amazing. I didn't realize that kindergarten children could comprehend so much.Word of Warning: This is ONLY the very basics that a child should be able to learn. This is NOT the be all end all of a kindergarten curriculum to use for homeschooling. However, it can be used as a place to jump start your learning. You will need to add more literature and poetry and math activities. However, it's a well rounded, full of information, useful book."
4,Really helps give the basics,"This book would have received five stars from me but for the lack of bright pictures. There's no denying that pictures really help engage young kids so for the kindergartener to second grader titles at least, the publishers could have considered using larger images and more colors. But all that aside, this series is a great comfort because it helps seal whatever ""gaps"" I feel may be in our homeschooling curriculum. I like the way they include not only stories and fables but also ideas on teaching math and necessary info on science, history etc. I also use the series to back up lessons. For instance, I read my son the King Midas story and compared it with another version of King Midas in another book to explain how different authors tackle stories differently. It also gives me ideas for lesson plans and it helps wrap up our day when I either read it to my son or he reads it independently as a bedtime storybook. Altogether a great multi-tasking series."
4,Great Start for Homeschooling Kindergartners,"This is not an all-inclusive text, as it may appear at first. It does have good suggestions to get you started on the homeschooling path. I feel like it is a bit too sparse for what I want to accomplish with my kindergartner but it was still worth buying just for the information it contains. If you are thinking about homeschooling I would suggest reading this book:So You're Thinking About Homeschooling: Second Edition: Fifteen Families Show How You Can Do It (Focus on the Family)"
1,Waste of money,I have not listened to the entire CD since I bought it. Go to I-Tunes and grab the one or two you really like and keep moving.
1,no doubt was never good,"No doubt has never been a good band they sucked from the begening. Their first album flopped when gwen's brother was the singer. They only got popular when gwen broke up with the gutarist and actully could write something descent, and a producer came in and chANGED THEIR 8 MINUTE SONGS into something that will sell. Now that the dust has settled from the break up and their not making songs like im just a girl no doubt complety sucks. All their music is crap hella good is one of the worst songs ever it is all pop their is not even a guitar playing in that song. All of no doubts music is going to suck completly from now on and i am going to be glad when they die out. They had their moment of luck they wheir never a good band. Their music is awfull."
1,Whatever.,"No Doubt is a really bad band...no talent, they just write a bunch of really boring songs. Don't pay any attention to them, just let them wallow in their talentless misery."
3,Okay,"I love Gwen Stefani, so I like to listen to her, but there's only a few songs I like on this album."
5,Great notes too!,"Aside from being a great CD the liner notes are great too. For someone who doesn't know all there to know about No Doubt the liner notes give you the backstory on all the songs plus a time-appropriate photo for each song. If you don't own any No Doubt already, buy this CD--you'll recognize every song and for those lyrics you didn't know you'll have the words to sing along to."
5,The Best Band - Their Best Songs,"How could anyone give this album a bad review???We're talking NO DOUBT --- in my opinion, the BEST rock/alternative/pop/top40 band of the last decade!Put all of their songs on one album --- were talking one of the greatest musical orgies of all time!Unless you only listen to classical music (like my Dad), then this is one album that belongs in the library collection of ALL music lovers!Whether it be the reggae beats of Underneath It All, the raver beats of Hella Good, or the ska beats of Spiderwebs --- this band has shown that no one else has perfectly created a fushion of so many different musical genres, with a sound that everyone can love!Unless you already own every single No Doubt album, I highly recommend this album --- if you are only going to own ONE No Doubt album, then as of 2004, let this one be it!"
4,Not as good as The Warrants,"This album has a great collection of songs, but John Doe and The Warrants: The hits 1984 - 1990 is a much better buy. I highly recommend any of The Warrants albums."
1,Won't use lexmark again,"this just died one day. without warning, dead. Ink was very expensive and the Wifi was tough to set up. It is long gone but Amazon suggested I review it..."
5,"Thank you, PBS","This is a skillfully crafted, historically accurate. poignant and powerful documentary. For anyone interested in the impact of war on civilians, and the heroes who do not wear uniforms, this is a must see."
5,Essential Reading,"There are only a handful of authors that have moved me to laughter, tears, and wonderment in the same book. Perhaps the fact that Henderson herself was a school teacher, has added so much to her stories. I recently retired but I saw so very many of her 'characters' move through my classes year after year. She has a way of reminding us that there is always hope but she never tries to 'gloss'over the fact that death is still very real and painful.She plays emotions as if they were a harp and all who read her are the better for listening to her music."
5,There's hope for us yet!,"Dunno where the Booklist reviewer got his information, But I was hooked LONG before the TV movie. Even after 35 years, the umpteenth reading of these stories can make me laugh, cry, resolve to be better myself. All these stories of a people shipwrecked among strangers are a real pleasure to read."
5,Glad the stories are back in print,"These are great stories--the only quibble I have is that Anything Box and Holding Wonder haven't been reissued (I could use new copies of those too!). I disagree with some of the critics/reviewers--many of the stories in the other two books were ""People"" stories as well, they are just told differently.I am also glad that there were some new stories that are in this book (that weren't in Pilgrimage and The People). I think this book should be required reading in schools instead of Harry Potter and other such drivel."
3,I just can't give it 5 stars,"For an author who repeatedly touches on his admiration of the beauty of the writing Admiral Beaufort brought to the wind scale, the writing style of ""Defining the Wind"" falls short for me. It seems the author couldn't quite decide if the book was an academic text or a popular history volume and the inconsistency grated on me. Especially the use of pop culture references feels gratuitous (e.g. use of ""white Ford Bronco"" for a simile for a slow moving sailing ship) and makes a book that could be readable for years seem dated almost out of the wrapper. The book also seems very repetitive. The same source text is referenced often in chapters that seemingly are about a new topic. I think the book was worth reading, I just found the author and the writing style came to the forefront much too often as I read instead of the content and Admiral Beaufort himself."
1,So Disappointing,"The music sounded too electronic, and the girls' voices seemed to take a back seat to this kind of sound. About half the songs are remakes of thier previous hits. Problem is that these songs are not equal to, or better than, the originals. Sadly, I couldn't find any real redeeming value to this disc at all."
3,Nice Reflection,"If your looking for some updated tracks from this group buy it. The only single (and all are singles less then 4 minutes) I whould like to hear again is ""I Heard A Rumour"". All are down tempo tracks which seems to be the trend these days. Sadly this is not for true fans like myself. Wishing for a CD of all their 12"" singles; ALL OF THEM! Hey.......DVD of the singles whould be nice too."
5,Real Encounters,"The Dodo and Mauritius Island, Imaginary Encounters, is a reconstruction and a photographic study of the long extinct dodo bird. Until we successfully reclaim these animals from extinction utilizing their DNA, recovered in July 2007 on Mauritius Island, this will be the next best thing to being there!"
3,Zelazny on presentations,"This tells me more about Zelazny than info about making presentations.But he's pretty interesting, and it's good to see his viewpoint."
4,Good but Deceiving,"This movie is good if you like action; which I do, but for some reason they present it as if Batista is the star of the movie. That is definitely not true. The true star is Rob Van Dam, and he is very good in this movie. Dave Bastista barely appears in the movie at all; eventhough when he does appear his character is worth the wait. But overall, it is a very good movie for an action junkie like myself."
2,Hitting the lowest,"This has to be one of the worst of the current ""B"" straight-to-videos ever. The acting was so bad it rates a special grade of its own. Each situation where the good guys were caught looked so predictable and contrived. The action, if it can be termed action, looked as if it had been made up on the spot. Fights were badly staged and clumsy, and since when do opponents sort of stand around waiting for their turn to get whacked? Our ""hero"" just didn't cut it. The guy just wasn't even in the ring. And who wrote that cheesey dialog? Every cliche ever uttered was here. Please do not let there be WRONG SIDE OF TOWN 2."
2,actionman,this was a VERY LOW BUDGETED film I guessI bought it thinking that Bautista was the main character but only played little parts here & there it was mainly Rob Van Dam. I wouldn't tell any action film watchers to buy this film. If you wait a bit you'll find this in Big Lots for sale at 2 - 3 dollars.
2,Good price but poor quality,The seat foam was poor quality/ low density......not comfortable. Don't feel that it would have held up for very long.
5,It really works,"I have been visiting the eye doctor religiously every year but had deterioration in the my left eye where I have been applying my ""mono lens"" for several years. Myvision was cloudy and the contact lens seemed to dry up by the end of the day. I realized that my left eye (my non-dominant eye) was not producing tears and that I had a film covering it when I woke in the morning. Fearing that I would not be able to use my contact lens any longer, I decided to try lubrication to see if it would help. I found this product at a local drug store and gave it a try. Every night I applied one to two drops of Similasan Dry Eye relief and gently stimulated my tear duct at the inner canthus of my eye. Within one week, my eye was tearing up as it should and my vision was improved dramatically. I think it is a fantastic product and highly recommend it."
1,"Format, price too much...","I love Neil Young. I have everything the man has ever released officially.That includes all the recent Archive releases, which have all been outstanding.But let's face it. This is too much. More than $310 for 10 DVDs? Who else would charge such a price?And the format is terrible. For that price, it should be 10 DVDS AND 10 CDs with maybe even a vinyl album or two.I think Neil may be suffering from John McCain syndrome and forgotten how many houses he owns. The price is ridiculous. Not in this economy.Good luck, Neil. I'm sure it will be excellent, but I've got a family to feed.That is, if it even comes out."
1,life distraction,"I would have settled for a remaster of Decade with some extras thrown in. If Neil cared so much for audio purists, he would have gotten some quality 2-channel material out there. This is for surround sound nutz, only. No wonder this took a while to come to fruition, how much lipstick does this pig need ? This seems more like a personal Neil Young Experience (ala Epcot Center) in your own home. I just want to listen to some mellow backround tunes, while I go about my life not a distracting shrine to some Canadian weirdo. No thanks."
1,to much,been a neil young fan for proably 35 years but this is to much for the average working person.
1,Contains inaccurate information,"While the photographs are quite lovely, many of the captions accompanying them contain incorrect dates and countries of origin. I do not recommend this as a learning reference, but it may be worth having as a general overview of fan styles."
1,Not Free SF Reader,"Another book that you could use as a cure for insomnia. Try and do a Jules Verne type story. Take the fun and adventure out. Make it boring and unappealing. Voila. You have C.S. Lewis's planet trilogy. Characters should seem a little bit like people, in general, if they are supposed to actually be human beings."
3,GREAT WRITING but not such a great plot,"I LOVE the author but not a fan of this book.I suggest it to those who enjoy,creepy,crawly,sending shivers down your spine,and make your skin crawl!!!!"
3,"Worth reading, but has middle-of-trilogy pacing problems.","Unlike the first volume of the trilogy that begins with ""Out of the Silent Planet"" and concludes in ""That Hideous Strength,"" this book is a slow mover. The climactic battle, once it comes, has plenty of blood and terror; but getting there takes some patience. Its depiction of evil's chilling, banal brutality also takes a strong stomach.With that said, though, Lewis describes the innocent world we know as Venus with detail and poetry. I fear his view of women and their proper role belongs to my grandfather's generation; but that I have to forgive, because - after all - they fought in the same war.Worth reading in order to get from Book One to Book Three."
5,Best Scifi ever,"Love this trilogy. Read it first many years ago, and loving going through it again. A must have for any lover of good scifi and spiritual traveller"
2,alright album,"i recon this cd isn't great but not stink. the first song on the cd [is bad], the guy singing sounds half dead. the rest of the songs sound much the same except 4 a couple. if u have a few bucks to spear i would buy this album. if your stuck on money but u love that pod sound i woundn't botha buying it, cool, peace out my christian brothas"
3,Its ok,This is a waste of money if you already have a N64 but if you don't have one and your kid loves pokemon its good. it is actually pretty cute with the light up pikachu cheeks and stuff. I only gave it 3 stars because its like a half/half situation. But keep in mind if you buy this for your little pikachu/pokemon fan....this console is going to last thema few years if not their lifetime...they will certainly outgrow pokemon and then your stuck with a console that your kid thinks is only for 'losers' and then you probably have to buy a new one!
5,Very Awesome System,"It is simple to say that if you are a Pokemon fan then it should go without saying that this is a product for you. I grew up with the normal N64 and once I actually found out that there was a Pikachu Edition, I had to buy one. The reset button doesn't get stuck as easy as the normal N64's AND Pikachu's friggin cheeks light up. This is a must have product for hardcore Pokemon fans."
1,Terrible replacement toner,"This toner cartridge only lasted 3 months before it started giving sporadic output. The other brand I bought lasted almost two years and the one before that more than one year and neither of those ever went sporadic, they ran out of toner. This one does not show that it is low or out of toner (and it should not be yet), but it is not printing on 1/3 of the page. If I shake it, it will print 1 page good and the start being sporadic again. Avoid this brand. The good one I bought was sold by inkers."
2,Awful,"Dreary Tripe, the only good thing about this movie is the cast.Historically inaccurate as far as armour goes, and Ray Charles could have see that the location is Spain and not England."
4,An ending worth sticking around for,"This movie was a bit slow and tedious at times. How ever I am such a huge fan of Sean Connery and Audry Hepburn, that I could not turn it off. I kept wondering what would happen next. I was waiting for something worthy of these two actors to happen.Then It happened. (A sort of spoiler alert.) The final scene was the best love scene that I had ever saw in my whole life. It was highly emotional, as was I. I felt their pain, as I understood what the whole point of the movie was, love and sacrifice. It was a memorable ending to a movie that I will have to watch several times to be able to fully understand the depth of it.I highly recommend this movie to all adults, because we have all suffered love, loss, and aging therefore we can relate to these characters."
1,Is this some sort of joke?,"Please tell me that this book is a joke. I read the first two chapters, and had to put it down. It was boring! And stupid. Very stupid. The whole part about Being an Heiress was a laugh riot! But it was totally unrealistic. She said that whenever your depressed, go on a shopping spree. Like I have the money to go on a shopping spree. I doubt that she took into account the fact that half the people in the U.S can't afford to go on a shopping spree whenever they feel blue. It was unrealistic, and could be read by a 3rd grader."
1,she thinks she's so great...,I checked out reviews of this book when it first was released. There were so many bad reiews of it that I felt sorry for Paris and figured I'd give the book a chance - but it clearly isen't worth buying. If you must ead this...or look at the pictures... borrow a copy from someone. Don't waste your money!
3,I'm going to be honest with you...,"...I just bought this book to see the pictures.This was an entertaining read, like reading ""Star"" magazine, or ""People.""Don't take her advice seriously, I didn't and I don't think Paris even takes herself seriously.It's all just for fun.3 stars"
1,Eh,"To the kid who said that the title should be ""Confessions of A Heiress"": this would actually be incorrect grammar. Since it's pronounced like 'airess' and not 'hairess', the indefinite article would have to be 'an.' Also, keep in mind of rule that an indefinite article is 'a' if the next word in a given sentence starts with a consonant--and, in this case, the consonant was silent."
4,"Cute, interesting.",Not a novel. Very tongue in cheek and silly. Interesting with lots of glossy pictures. She knows how to laugh at herself.
3,I love myself,"Wow.. it's one thing to have self confidence but this girl is absolutely in LOVE with herself. It's not a book to take seriously, nor does she. It was a book to flip through because it's filled with pictures but it's hardly something I'd recommend buying."
2,Boring,I was very unimpressed with the book. I was excited to sit down and have a nice relaxing evening looking into Paris' life and what she had to say...I fell asleep within 30 pages! I gave th ebook a second chance; and it was as unimpressive the second read as the first. My advice is to save your money and get a different book.
2,"Photos interesting, the rest a total waste","I had such higher expectations for this book. I wanted to hear the real story, and the writing is terrible and the book is so shallow. I learned more about life as a heiress reading Bergdorf Blondes. For the money, at least Paris Hilton could have given us some good info or inside story!I did see that she is really a pretty girl & has beautiful hair under those cheesy hair extensions she wears. The pictures were fun to look at, but it would have been nice if there had been captions."
1,"Keep it Up, Paris!","Keep eating fast food, drinking soda, partying until 3:00 am, acting ditzy, and sleeping in your makeup for that ""dewy"" look. I will see you when you are 40 and will see how glam you are then! Can't wait!"
1,"Like Seinfeld, about nothing, but less funny.",Paris Hilton is famous for being wealthy. Great. When is she going to do something to deserve her fame? Because this book is not it.
5,Do you love it?,.... i did!almost as much as i love paris!i cnat believe Amazon actually let all u kids type what u did about her!y must u b so jealous?Is it because you have such a rubbish life yrself?anyway! if u r a fan i PROMISE! u will LOVE this book!ciao Bit*hes!
3,Fair,My grandson was not as happy to watch this as he is the other Tom and Jerry DVDs. I guess it is too musical and not enough to laugh over for him.
2,misleading and disappointing,"It is hard to find a good nursing bra, but keep looking, this is not it! My biggest problem with this bra is the fit. It claims to be 'light support,' but it smashes my chest and gives me an unpleasant ""uniboob"" that is both unattractive and uncomfortable. This may be due to the fact that, although I'm a 34C, the medium is too tight. [...] I recommend anyone who considers themself a medium to get a large, especially if you recently gave birth and have tender breasts. The tightness would be unbearable. Even if you got the right fit, I still don't really recommend this bra. There's a strange support element that cuts across and under the breast that gets in the way of nursing pads, which are necessary for many of us.Due to design and fit issues, I give this bra a thumbs down."
2,"This tape is The Tortoise, spliced and diced","I bought this hoping to add another Firm tape to my collection, and it turned out to be ""The Tortoise"" tape, spliced and re-edited, with the warmup dance and abs sections removed. I loved the Tortoise, in fact it was much better with all the above stuff and without all the talking. Disappointing."
3,low quality pictures,"The material is well structured and the book is written in a clear and concise manner that's why I give five stars to the author. But I am really disappointed because I do believe that is unacceptable nowadays to allow for printing a book with such a poor quality of sketches/pictures. I think that most of them are scanned from previous material, and unfortunately it turned out that the scanning equipment was too sophisticated for author's assistants. So, I rate the publisher with just one star! - Please note that my comment refers to the fifth edition."
2,Small and dull,"This is a low priced diamond ring, and you get what you pay for.The diamond itself is in a fairly raised setting, but the diamond is very shallow inside of the setting. Basically, it only looks good when you are viewing it from the top. From the sides you can see how little diamond there is.The diamond I received was quite yellow in tinge, I compared it to a $200 diamond ring that my sister owns. Also, it lacked much of the brilliance or sparkle that I saw in the other ring. The other diamond was also much larger, which already makes up for the price different.Even for the money I was disappointed in the quality because I felt like a cubic zirconia would have been much better, as this diamond did not stand out at all."
2,Takes a lot of time to load Dvds and sometime it freezes picture,"Takes almost 2 minutes to open up the CD/DVD tray and takes another 2 minutes to load the movie. Also, it freezes picture sometime. As per as the quality of the picture goes it is pretty good though."
1,Sony BDP-S300 no stars,"Very SLOW response to any command change. Poor and confusing navigation. Very sensitive to the slightest problem with any disk Blu-ray or DVD so not suitable for use with rental disks. Firmware upgrades not corrective by any means, most recent update v3.8 done on 4/12/08.I received this as a gift, I feel bad for the people that so generously gave me this item.It does do a good job up-sampling DVDs, when it will play them."
3,Nice picture but so SLOW,"Picture looks great, but when you turn it on, it takes FOREVER to start up. I will keep my old Marantz DVD player to play DVD's and use this only for BRD's.Also, it doesn't like old-generation TV's. I had a Hitachi 42"" monitor with DVI input. The Sony unit refused to even power up correctly with the Hitachi attached to it. I thought the unit was broken at first. In the end I used this as an excuse to upgrade to a 1080p unit with HDMI, but I shouldn't have had to...."
4,Sony BDP-S300 Blu-ray,"I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but the preliminary reveiew it is a great player"
3,good put slow loading,our old sony loaded the discs for playing much more quickly. This machine does play the disks well . .
1,Overpriced and difficult to use.,"Takes for ever to warm up, turn off, respond to any ""command."" If you accidentally press the wrong button on the remote, you have to start all over again."
3,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW","I bought this unit from Costco because of the price - approx $275. Setup is simple and picture quality (Blu-ray) is amazing. After reading some reviews, I installed the latest update, and it was still slow, improved, but slow. After using it for a couple of weeks, I returned it and purchased a Panasonic DMP-BD30. The Panasonic is sooo much better. Startup of standard DVDs is quicker, as well as Blu-ray startups. I do not recommend the Sony 300, even if it's less expensive. It will drive you nuts."
4,works well,well my brother has this one and i like it.a little slow on power up but other then that so far works vary well.im going to get me one as well after seeing his working.even reg. dvds look great.blu-ray disks looks almost live.it got me sold on it.i have a lot of reg. disks so if i get any that will not play ill come back and let you know.but i already like it well enough to get it.standby for and update on how well it works with reg. disks. i have 1000's to try out on it. :-)later...
1,Do NOT Buy This Model,"Purchased a BDP-S3 NEW on Oct 14, 2007. It locked up and was sent in for warranty repair on 6/10/08. Sony replaced Disc Drive & updated firmware 2.20 to 3.90. I have been using the repaired unit since June '08 and guess what! It has locked up for a second time. I will choose not to spend $50.00 to package, insure and ship back to Sony for it's second warranty repair!!! Do NOT Buy this product, You will BE sorry!!!"
2,waiting still....,"Although I like the better quality picture - this is seriously one of the slowest machines that I own. You can press the disc EJECT button, then go to the basement, start a load of laundry, do some dishes, return some books to the library, then go back upstairs and the machine may just then be preparing to open the disk drive. I'm serious! Every function takes forever - it's so frustrating! Besides this, it also takes forever to load certain movies in BluRay format - and even then, not all movies can be played on it. I regret buying this model - Sony usually is a favored product line, but they dropped the ball on this one!"
2,"Great picture, big annoying problems with player","I purchased my unit at Christmas in 2007. I've gradually begun using it more and more.The good:When you get a Blu-Ray DVD playing, the picture and sound quality rock!The bad:DVDs often take an inordinately long time to load. Really long.The worse:Many DVD's, especially NON blue-ray I've noticed, freeze up on the menu and there is nothing you can do to get it going again - I actually have to UNPLUG the DVD player and plug it back in to get it going again.I am deducting 1 star for the DVD load times and 2 stars for the freeze-up problem.I can't recommend this unit for the above reasons. I thought Sony would do better than this, a $300 player should not be so buggy and slow."
2,Comment more than a review,"I was browsing books on Kauai and would like to write, not a review, but a comment. I live on Kauai and want readers to know that this is a very small island. Those who know the most about the island are reluctant to write an unfavorable review about a book that may be written, literally, by their neighbor. We live the aloha spirit. This may explain the lack of reviews on this book."
2,Shoe size,I liked these shoes however they were 1/2 size too large. I had to return the shoes for a refund.
1,Not pleased!!,"As of today one month later, I have never recieved the product and I have never recieved any information I tried to obtain wondering where this shoe was. I tried to track it; I show it delieved to city of Industry, delivery pending??? Please find out about this asap and get back with me immediately. Poor follow-up"
4,Bob Live,"Great entertainment for the Bob fan in your life. High energy and with a story line as well. The live Bob and Wendy are true to the movies and give children a ""real"" sense to them. It is worth the purchase."
2,A real dissapointment.,"I thought from the title that this book was on native wildflowers of New Zealand. I was partially right. It has a lot of information on plants introduced from all over the world and only a few pages on the alpine section of this wonderful part of the world. I found no useful information in it at all and returned it after a thorough but quick look. Don't waste your time or money.I also ordered ""Gardener's Encyclopedia of New Zealand Native Plants"" by Yvonne Cave and Valda Paddison. It was all on native plants and had wonderful photographs and information. Get that book instead. I loved it. So did my co-workers at the nursery I work for."
4,volume 1 now available again (at long last!),"update: The publisher has made the first eighty pages (which go up to the middle of Chapter 24) of this book available as a free sample to download, on their website ""pullins dot com."" So you can order the book now and start studying today with the free sample while you wait for your hard copy to arrive."
3,Holiday Tree Keeper Bag,Be careful not to let the tree branch edges poke through the bag. We have a seven foot tree that fit into this bag just right.
2,Handles tore off on first use,"This bag cannot handle the weight of 6 foot artificial Christmas tree. Sure, the tree fits into the bag perfectly. But after carrying the bag a short distance, the fabric handles tore away from the bag, leaving holes in the bag. Without handles, this bag is practically impossible to move.Rubbermaid could fix this problem by having the handle fabric wrap all the way under the bag.Don't buy this unless you're filling it with cotton balls, helium balloons, or packing peanuts. It cannot carry heavy items like a fake tree."
1,Don't waste your money,"After placing my tree in the bag, I grabbed the handles to move it and the straps ripped right off. My tree isn't that heavy and you can lift the tree by one hand."
3,How controversy can bring you down...,"Being assigned this book in my English 102 class, I have come to the realization that not only do book reading and movie going come to my mind in a whole other perspective, but it has further forced me to come to a more realistic view of this book reading process, and the fact that, if one is going to write something, they better darn well be telling the truth! Besides the controversy and other thoughts, I thought this book was actually pretty good. I'm not too much of a heavy book reader, but I did thoroughly enjoy reading of Frank Hopkins' journeys and adventures. Having found possible evidence of fraudulent writing through the O'Reilly's and Long Riders' Guild Research, it was quite hard for me to rate the deserved 4* of the book itself. If only it weren't for those words...""Based on a TRUE story..."""
5,A lesson learned about truth...,"This is a five-star book; Hopkins' stories are very colorful and interesting. Although they may not be literally true, because it is nearly impossible for one human being to accomplish all that he claimed to have done, the book is still entertaining. Also, the footnotes by the many historians and researchers, especially the O'Reillys' with the Long Riders' Guild, were extremely informative, and I commend them for working so hard on researching this hoax because a lot of people were not on their side especially the ones involved with Hollywood. But the difference from the historians and Hollywood is fairly simple: the researchers told the TRUTH. I do believe that the Disney Movie should have been advertised as based upon a story, not a true one, although I did enjoy the movie. If someone were to write a book, and it is claimed to be true, then you probably should tell the truth. All in all I do highly recommend this book."
3,"Good recipes, annoying format","I'm not sure if there are different versions of this cookbook, but the one I bought is the size of a paperback novel. That makes it quite hard to use in the kitchen, because the pages and print are very small, and the book won't stay open on the counter unless you break the spine.However, the recipes I've tried have been pretty good. Just look around to see if it comes in hardcover or another, easier, format."
5,My Favorite Book,"This book was absolutley wonderful. It kept my attention the whole way through. This was the first book of his tha I have ever read, and I will continue to read his books. The book had so much emotion and meaning that I read it the whole way through without stopping."
4,basic comfortable,"this is a no frills basic comfortable bra that has good support. i've tried many others. Granted they may be prettier, but they itch, pull, pinch, make bumps under clothes. this one fits and i can grab it in the morning without worrying about what it'll look like under what i'm wearing and wear all day without tugging at it."
5,Fabulous--Best Bra You Can Buy,"This has been my go-to bra for years, and I LOVE it. Great support and comfort for full-figured women (I am 34DDD) and looks great under clothes--no lumps or bumps. My back NEVER aches with this bra. Worthy investment."
4,clinker plywood boatbuilding manual,"I like this book/manual. It offers a lot of informaton. Sometimes the information could be more specific, there could be more detail. It has a lot of pictures which are certainly good to add and to study. The information is very compact."
5,arrived quickly,Top quality and arrived in time for a birthday gift. I liked the selection of movies included. Three more words required :-)
1,"I so wanted to buy this, too.","Chalk me up as another person who was ready to order until I saw they were out of sequence. I only buy stuff I want to collect, and who wants their Bond collection to be all mixed up like this?"
2,Another disappointment for the fans...,"Once again, the folks who run the Bond franchise have made a mistake and aren't thinking. When will they finally get it through their skulls that fans of James Bond want the ENTIRE collection instead of just a select few?I am a huge Bond fan and while I am quite sure that the restoration process of these films has made them something to treasure and watch over & over again, I simply cannot buy any of collection until they come to their senses and release ALL of the Bond movies in one restored package.The true fans of Bond want the good with the bad and I hope that someone, somewhere will realize that one day."
3,007 Review - Vol 1,"I'm a big Bond fan. I received this as a gift. It has all the classics I've watched over the years. While this is a good collection, I recommend vol. 3 of this collection (in the red box)."
4,"bond, james bond","how can anyone not like the james bond series? as the years go by, the dialogue which was once so funny now seems a little ""campy"" i just have to watch from start to finish."
5,Great gift,"This was a gift, so I cannot give a review of the actual films. The item shipped very quickly and was exactly as shown."
5,ELP Review,When I was younger there was an condensed version of this same concert on LP that I loved. Not only is the music I was already familiar with as good as I remembered but there are also extra tracks on the CD that just added to this great live album. I would recommend this album for it's inventive and ecclectic use of various styles of music to anyone.
4,It's not that bad.,"I think some of the other reviews are a bit harsh, and Ithink if you're an ELP fan that you won't be completely dissapointed by this live recording. It was recorded whenthey were carrying a 72 piece orchestra, so it's kind ofinteresting. But for live recordings of ELP with their 72 piece orchestra, I think the ELP King Biscuit Live has this one beat hands down."
4,Better listened to as a whole,"Decent yet lacking...It is near the end of ELP(1977) so one can't expect a whole lot.Good songs,Horrible recording."
5,Artists and Lovers of the Artistic Life Unite!,"This movie and the ""age of consent"" movie are a great bit of fun to explore. The Artist Normand Lindsay seems to be the inspiration, and Art the reason for living. I agree!"
3,Norman Lindsey was this about YOU?,"Norman Lindsey was a famous Australian Cartoonist, painter & author. He wrote ""The Age of Consent"" which a young Helen Mirran starred in 1968?I think this film was sort of based on Norman Lindsey a brilliant man.I did like the film but not totally.SirensEllie McPherson was STUNNING and worth the price alone. Hugh Grant always plays the same bumbling idiot in almost ALL of his movies. He looks like Stan Laurel of Laurel & Hardy. LOL!"
1,No True Diva,"This was probably one of the worse books I have ever read. It was all I could do to make it to the end of the book. I kept hoping that it would get better - it never did. Poor plot, weak characters and to much dropping of designer everthing. The heroine in this novel was quite pathetic."
3,eYe-CaNDy FoR NoN THiNKeRS,"Daryl Hannah and Clea Duvall were beautifully cast in a good intentioned story...but the script was lacking and predictable.The shots were dreamily executed...so I'm giving it 3 stars. If Eric Roberts weren't in it and I had to think a little more, I'd have given it 4.5 stars. Eric Roberts TRUELY gives me the creeps!Buy this used...or don't buy it at all."
2,Meandering but likeable coming of age movie,"Wildflowers is about 17-year-old Cally's search for her past. She was raised on a commune by hippies in the 1960's (the movie is set in 1985), and now she lives with her father. She's been told little about her mother, except that she had to leave Cally and her father because she got in trouble for her political activities. Cally becomes convinced that the woman she meets in San Francisco (Daryl Hannah) is her mother, and she tries to become friends with the woman. As she learns more about the woman and her father, she also begins to understand herself better. The story is simple and straight forward, and the style and acting are extremely low-key. Although the movie is not great by any standards, it is fairly likeable. Look fast for a quick appearance by Blue's Traveller. Overall, a very average small-budget film."
2,Not the best MMW,"Do not get me wrong, I can not think of a more enjoyable band to see live or listen to in the car then MMW. But their first CD is just not that good. As someone else said, if I want a jazz Cd I will go buy Duke Ellington. This CD has too much basic jazz, not like their next albums which had a much more eccentric and off the wall jazz feel. Not very jam oriented either. The one good point of this disc would be the cover of the Duke's hit, ""Caravan,"" which I would just prefer to have the original of. Do not buy if this is your first MMW pick. For only the serious collector."
4,Decent cam.,"Reasonable picture clarity on this cam. This camera is smaller than i thought it would be, i guess i missed the part that stated that it is MADE for a laptop?I ended up having to clip it to the side of my desk.. but it's still in a good view of people at the desk. A better product description would be all i'd ask for.All in all a good experience though, i recieved it quickly and with no problems."""
1,POS,"Negative 5 stars. This product and the drops are pure crap. There are ACTIVE fleas on my dogs right now. Lies. I want my money back. I'm collecting the fleas to send to the company. Have been using for 2 weeks, sprayed my carpet, vacuumed, etc."
5,Great fan!!!,This fan was very easy to install and is super quiet. I plan to add a light fixture later. I have been using Hunter fans for many years and have not been disappointed.
5,Excellent Ceiling Fan,"I've had this ceiling fan for approximately 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with it. I will say that although I am not the person who assembled and installed it, it seemed to be pretty easy to do both. I really like the antique brass finish; I was having a diffcult time locating a ceiling fan with this type of finish in any of the big box stores or home improvement stores and came across this on on Amazon. I will say that the price for this fan is almost half of what you can find it for in the home improvement stores. Overall, I highly recommend this fan."
4,Wonderful for your back,"This is so comfortable, I just have a hard time keeping it centered on my chair. It likes to slide from side to side. But it eases the tension from my shoulders and forces me to have better posture. I highly recommend this."
1,I can't believe I paid $14 for this,"I got no plumping whatsoever, the scent is odd, and the color is disgusting. It looks like transparent gloss in the picture, but it's not. Once applied, it almost looks like white lipstick from the 60's."
4,"The first one they got right after ""10""","The death of Terry Kath after Chicago X must have hit the group pretty hard. A couple of singles off of ""Hot Streets"" and the ""Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Love Me Tomorrow"" duo off of XVI were pretty much all they had to show for in this period. Along comes XVII, and suddenly they're back on the charts with four singles (and matching MTV videos) such as ""Hard Habit to Break"", and ""You're the Inspiration"". They had found their roots again, and it paid off for them. Sadly, Peter Cetera was not staying long afterward, but this album is a good representation of his later Chicago offerings."
3,A rather farcical premise...,"Saw that coming a mile away... Kind of cheesy, but very well written and nicely described. Coulter's usual work, with wonderful lovable characters and an exciting action storyline. The mystery thing just kind of made me grin a little, I mean, come on, a romance novel heroine finds a long-sought-after historical artefact? :) I mean, it's the first book in a series (and has crossover characters from the Bride series as well - Sinjun and Colin Kinross), how is she going to top this?Either way, the book was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it to fans of Coulter's who may have missed it!"
2,Very disappointing!,The conversations and actions of the characters were totally unbelievable. I had to force myself to finish the book.
4,Never saw the item,"Never saw the item, but I sent it as a gift. It was shipped really fast so that was good."
2,Died after two months,"This pump is super fast and powerful. However, there is no way to control the pump speed....After two months it died on me....There's not much else to say. Unfortunately I will need to get another one of these because there is not much choice in this price range. So I suppose you get what you pay for."
2,A So-So Hit and Miss,"So-so collection from the year 1986 mixing gems like Timbuk 3's deeply cynical and scathing ""The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades,"" Howard Jones' pensive ""No One is To Blame,"" Eddie Money's comeback hit ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (rendered immeasurably essential thanks to the explosive vocals of Ronnie Spector) and The Dream Academy's wispy ""Life in a Northern Town,"" with really lame cuts like Starship's ""Sara,"" Glass Tiger's ""Don't Forget Me,"" Mr. Mister's ""Kyrie,"" Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" and Falco's gimmicky ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Missing from this collection are Steve Winwood's ""Higher Love,"" Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer,"" Pet Shop Boys' ""West End Girls,"" and Human League's ""Human"" (each of which was a #1 single in 1986). As a result the dross outnumbers the gems. Pass."
1,pretty sure it's fake,"this is not the first perfume i've purchased from amazon (Amazon LLC, not other sellers just to be on the safe side) and have been quite satisfied but I'm 95% certain this one is a fake. it smells strongly of alcohol. i've smelled the real Kenneth Cole black for men and it smelled so heavenly. the last time i smelt such an 'alcoholy' scent was when i bought what i soon realized was knockoff perfume from some small store in new york. the knockoff perfume capital of the world.sometimes things are too good to be true. Whoever sold this to amazon sold them fake stuff."
5,"Great perfume, great price","Love this perfume, can't find it anywhere. Glad to find it finally at a great price."
3,Educational,This book was informative as to the origin of lives in VA as well as the lay of the land prior to inhabitants.
2,Not as described,"I have seen this movie in France when it first came out and was very thrilled to be able to get a DVD copy. However, even though it was advertized as being in French language, I was disappointed to receive a movie very poorly dubbed in English.Would be thrilled if it is released in its original form and would buy it without second thought as it is one of the best suspense movies I ever seen."
2,Non-native Speakers of English,"It is a shame that a book on such an important topic as high pressure chemical processing has an introductory chapter that is so nauseating. This is a great example of why technical writings should not be translated into English using a dictionary. Rather, the text should be translated by someone with knowledge of the research area and a VERY GOOD knowledge of English. There are many glaring examples of a poor understanding of English usage and grammar in the very first section of this book alone. The rest of the text suffers from this section, and the native reader will likely decide to find another source of information rather than suffer through this volume. My conclusion is that, aside from the list of citations, this book is an entire waste of time."
1,This is nascar music,"The music was great, but the singing is really annoying and off key at times. With a better singer this album would be alot better."
1,Do Not buy from this company,They substituted a scentless spray that is NOT PET SAFE. Warnings on can do not get on skin or in eyes. Type displayed on web page is PETSAFE. Buy from this provider at you own risk.
2,Used. not a new book.,"Unlike it said it's a new book, I've checked that there were marks from here and there. Paid $80+ for this.. in fact, used book cost only $2.50."
1,Terrible Book,"I purchased this because I spent my twenties in SF and am currently raising my own family here. The storyline is pretty lame and the name-dropping gets incredibly irritating. While it is interesting to hear the names of locations that are and were staples of SF in the 1970s, the clothing brand dropping is cringe-worthly. When I finished this book I literally let out a sigh of relief and wished I had those hours of my life back."
3,Important for its time but...,"I'm sure this would have made a much larger impact on the reader back when it was written. I think part of its appeal was that it was fresh at the time.That being said, I wouldn't necessarily dissuade anyone from reading this. It was an entertaining read and gave a glimpse into (what is now) history. The problems are that I didn't feel connected to any of the characters and there was no resolution on a certain issue (I can't give it away here). Obviously, there is a need to read the sequel to solve the mystery. The other thing that bothered me was that everyone knew or was connected to everyone else. It was just one coincidence after another, which got really annoying. Maybe the gay community was that small and interconnected, I don't know, but this was true for gays and straights alike."
3,A Gazillion Chapters,"The author sneaks short peeks of 2-45 minutes into the lives of the characters. Most of these peeks are 3-4 pages each making it a fast read. Maybe this helps keep the reader from getting bored, Frankly, for me it was frustrating as just as you get acquainted and reacquainted with the interesting characters the chapter ends and the next chapter takes us to other characters, much like TV soap-operas except the author is not so cruel as to always leave us at the most dramatic moment.Most of the story takes place through conversation and it is very close to realistic, except there's a lot more wit in the book then in most real conversations.The author also glosses over the sex which is ironic given that the stories take place in very liberal, sexually open San Francisco.Finally the vast majority of characters are masochistically unhappy; they ought to be taken out back and slapped around to get them to realize how happy they should be."
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed ""Tales..."" but the short chapters chopped it up too much for me. I read it in about a week, and I think that for full effect it might best be read in two days so it's like a mosaic and pulls together more as a whole.I really enjoyed the San Francisco locales and the early seventies time period. I actually spent some time in SF about that time and quite a bit since, and this book really captured the feel and magic of the city. The characters were quirky and, although a bit over the top, scarily close to real life.I read another review saying other books in the series are paced better, so I might give them a try."
5,Tales is a must read!,"Funny, heartwarming, complex, witful and realistic characters that I'm positive you know someone who's just like one of them. I discovered two of my close friends had already read it and both recommended it and i absolutely do too!!!"
4,Great summer reading,"Maupin's tale of San Fransisco is a fun-filled jaunt through the lives of the deliciously sinful characters that surround 28 Barbary Lane. Sex, drugs, and maybe not so much rock n' roll (this is the 70's - let's stick to disco) permeate the atmosphere as a cast of over 10 loveable people discover their place in the world. This is a plot that will not draw you in the way it could, nor are the intriguing characters all that worthy of sympathy. However I find myself in quite an introspective mood after reading a few chapters, as I ask myself the same questions posed to Mary Ann, Mrs. Madgrigal, and the others. My advice: take this series to the beach, and have fun with it."
4,The Dickens of 1970s San Francisco? Nah--but a fun read...,"""Tales of the City"" by Maupin is a fun, nostalgic romp through 1970s San Francisco. Set in the disco, drug, and easy sex days in the nation's hippest city-still coming down from its Summer of Love high-""Tales of the City"" weaves the stories of several characters in gripping and fun serial fashion.Maupin originally wrote the vignettes as a series of newspaper columns. The book collected these columns together, so you can whip through the stories without having to wait for another installment. And you will whip through this book. The length of the chapters and the cliff-hanger prose ensures a quick read.It's a fun if not deep book. It's especially interesting if you live in or often visit San Francisco. For really that's what this book is: a love story about a city."
5,George Strait 50 songs,I have aways loved George Strait so this CD is a compilation of all his greatest hits. I am enjoying it on my ipod every day. Thanks George!
1,Not up to snuff,"Most of the tunes are unplayable. Disc has some very deep scratches.Not in ""very good"" condition.More like in ""very used"" condition. I just want to be able to hear all of the songs, not justportions of them."
1,What a rip-off!,"First, here we have NO truth in advertising. Strait has had many, many #1 Country hits, but the count according to Billboard stands at 39, now achieved with his new single (and ONLY new recording on this collection) ""I Hate Everything"". Then, of course, it has been mentioned here before, many of the songs here have been edited and it shows. Some songs sound as if someone has come into your room and randomly lowered the volume. This is awful! I guess they have been edited to have enough space on the discs to include all of his ""51 #1s"". Here we go again. In short: I am very disappointed! When I see the many positive reviews here I develop a feeling that people really want to be ripped off, whether by George Strait or other people named George or differently."
3,George Strait's 50 No. 1's,Disappointed that it did not have Amarillo by Morning or Something Special. They were number one and more popular than some of the songs on this CD.
5,Super Effecient and Thoughful delivery of George Straight CD by Amazon just in time for Christmas,Thank you Amazon for being the best. Far excellent customer service.........and the delivery of this wonderful George Straight CD. The package was non-descript (just like you said it would be) So that way my boyfriend had no idea it was a gift for him or where it was from etc.It arrived so quickly and I was relieved of worry about it getting here on time.He has the CD in his truck and he loves it and his Dad now wants to get the CD too after hearing it while they were driving.Thanks Again Amazon for standing way above the rest!!!!!
1,Chopped-up versions,"I agree with the previous reviewer, many of these songs are cut up and mangled in some way. I should've done the math, 25 songs per disc with around 80 minute capacity leaves only a little over 3 minutes per song, not enough time. It's the same story as the Rolling Stones' ""40 Licks"". I hate when record companies do this, it makes me want to not buy anything else from them. I'd much rather have 40 complete songs or pay more for a 3-disc set for the album versions. Because of the edits, I don't think I'll ever listen to this. A complete waste of money. They could at least have the courtesy to warn you by giving track running times on the back cover, but that might cut in sales. Greed rules again in the record industry. Save your money."
5,The African House Groove via Paris,This is finally the point where traditional African music meets modern techno and sounds good. I wish they would open an Impala Lounge here in Chicago. It must be one partyin' joint. The Kerri Chandler track is fierce. It has to be the tightest house mix Afro-beat. It had everyone at a recent party at my pad doing tribal dancing they didn't even know they could do. the whole CD has so many differnent textures of African music. I hope Impala Lounge will do this in volumes forever. Keep it comming. Ase O
5,"Africa, Paris,","Finally a balanced blending of African rhythms, modern tech and house without losing the real African vibe. With time I think the world will get used to the African house thing. African rhythm is the driving force behind most dance music anyway."
3,Just so-so....,"The first one I ordered was lost in transit. My guess, based on the replacement one that did arrive, was that the box fell apart. This tower certainly is not on par with Wade's Cat Furniture (I have 2) but better than the ones in Petsmart/Petco. I got it for our two large Maine Coons. The color was not as shown. A little disappointed there. The one I got is more of a tan color. I'll keep it only because the hassle of returning this is not worth it. Maybe it will show less cat hair! Aside from the color, it appears to be pretty sturdy. The Coons climbed it and scratched on it right away. It wobbled a tiny bit but was far from tipping over when they jumped on it. Would I buy another one? No. I'll stick with Wade's or Arubacat."
2,"Good book...why a random page on ""Sex?""","As a school librarian, I purchased this book for my elementary school library. It's quite charming, the illustrations are great, and the text is often very witty. Imagine my surprise when the first 3rd grader who checked it out brought it to me the next morning saying, ""Have you read this book?"" She handed me the book with a bookmark in the page titled ""SEX."" The page says that horses have sex frequently and that it's too complicated to go into...and the illustration shows two horses in bed, one smoking a cigarette. Of the magazines and books scattered by the bed, one has the title, ""Night Horses and Wet Dreams."" I'm no prude, but I really don't understand the point of having this page and this illustration in a book that is otherwise perfect for 2 - 4th grade ""horse crazy"" girls. Yes, we know that horses have to make baby horses. But is it really necessary to have such a random and crass treatment of the subject in this book? Disappointing."
3,"A decent story, a frustrating outcome","An interesting story of Robert Stuart, the white explorer who learned from natives the existence of the South Pass through the Rocky Mountains and used the Pass in 1812 on a West-to-East trip. (South Pass is the only wagon-friendly route through the Rockies.) The purpose of Stuart's trip was basically a management report on a private company's progress. The trip was through largely uncharted territory, and dangers were encountered, but this is not a compelling read. Here's the most frustrating part: John Jacob Astor, Stuart's boss, elected to keep secret the existence of South Pass. So this critical piece of geographical info was not used until the Pass was re-discovered in 1823 by William Ashley, who publicized it, leading eventually to the Oregon Trail. Astor never used his ""trade secret."" That makes Stuart's trip an interesting historical footnote, not the landmark discovery it could have been if Stuart and Astor had publicized the existence of South Pass."
4,Joe D. Webb,"Jason and the boys do not disappoint on this CD.They take a step back to the roots of the original outlaw movement.Now this is not a party Cd,but if you like great songwriting skills combined with Jason""s excellent vocals this is must buy.Keep Spreading The Dirt Boys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,exploding lid,"My lid ""exploded"" also. My husband said it was leaning against something and slipped down to the counter and ""exploded"". I had only used the crock pot once!!! Beware!"
4,Most of Everything You Ever Wanted to Know...,"This book offers an excellent compendium of information about the ""calumet"", sacred pipe, or ""peace pipe"", however you call it. It covers the history of this sacred object from antiquity until the past century, with excellent maps, drawings and color photographs. It will satisfy the needs of all, from the casual reader to the serious scholar. The only topic not covered is the techniques of making a pipe from the Catlinite or other pipestone.It has an extensive bibliography for further research and a very inclusive index.For what it's worth, I find this book an excellent purchase and it will remain on my reference shelf for some time to come."
3,comfortable but a little small,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
1,Gross,"This book is in poor humor. It is intended to be a comic parody of the book ""Who Moved My Cheese."" I found it to be gross and disgusting. Buyer Beware!!!"
4,I love it!,This is the best doll I ever had I don`t see why some grown-ups don`t like it. The doll is married people and I love the belly that pops off and on. Grown-ups that do not like the doll are just being stupid the doll is a great doll and I am so happy mattel made it thanks mattel.
2,Questionable content,"I bought this after it was suggested for use with a classroom assignment about advertising. I was very surprised by the content. It would be fine for an adult or perhaps a college level class, but I won't use it with my high school students. There was far too much adult ""talking head"" information to hold students' interest. At the other extreme, were scenes of advertisements and tv and movie clips that are beyond inappropriate for a high school class. There are scenes from Jackass, young women in bikinis, both cloth and shaped from whipped cream and worse. I am in no way a prude and I have taught in alternative education my entire career. Interesting, but not appropriate classroom fare."
1,Don't Bother,"This collection is pretty weak even by the considerably less than lofty standards of the mid 70's. Hall and Oates' blue eyed soul hit ""Sara Smile"" is the only flat out gem here on a collection heavily weighed down by no less than five utterly embarrassing clunkers including the cringe inducing ""Afternoon Delight"" and Eric Carmen's ""All By Myself"" which still ranks as quite possibly the whiniest song in recorded history."
1,The miracle of passover,"Excellent. Enlightening and a blessing.love all of Zola,s books. Five star.plan to read more.so thankful for what the Jewish people have given us."
3,"uncensored collection,NOW!!!","in 2005 i bought all eight hellraiser films in a four month period, the first two as a two disc pack part one rated r part 2 unrated,boycotting stars/anchor bay re-release frenzy since,have considered selling off my copies of all eight till we americans get what we really want, directors cut editions (all deleted scenes re-cut back into all eight films. do the same with nightbreed,etci'm politely avoiding all clive barkers past works. last film i purchased was only barker produced ryuhei kitamura's midnight meat train dir cut based on barkers short story of the same name, i rate as very good but not great.yo! clive barker, take your movies back from the reigns of the studio's and give us loyal fans the directors edition collection you know we all deserve and give the mpaa and whomever else holding these originals back some dirty sign language, regain your artistic integrity in film,pleeeeeeeaaaaaase!!! i plitonically love your gay self. xoxoxo."
2,NOT ALL THAT!!!!,"I thought I was getting much more from this dvd set. I paid $40 but now you can get it new for about $33. thats a lot better but still not all that boxset. It's big and only comes with 3 dvds. If you want the Blueray that maybe its a good deal but if not, don't touch it. I thought it would slide in different parts to reveal the dvds, it just opens up to two parts with the dvds in the middle ""not that cool."" I would buy the special hellraiser dvds that just came out and look for a puzzle box online if you really want a hellraiser puzzlebox. I found some puzzle boxes a lot more detailed than this big flop."
2,not as advertised,"I purchased this book which was rated as ""like new"".It is old to the point of almost being brittle, the binding is starting to deteriorate and there is marking/notes in every chapter.This product does not have the value for which I paid and is not the book I want to have in my library."
2,Unacceptable image and audio quality,"Perhaps I'm too accustomed to the product that Criterion puts out and simply expected too much from this.The image and audio quality of these DVD's is horrible.They are full of Jump cuts, scratches, dirt, mangled frames, bad contrast and audio that warbles, cuts out and is inaudible..16mm classroom documentaries are better quality.I purchased this product to quickly digest the genre, so it's a bit of an academic exersize for me and I'm living with these atrocious transfers.However I do not recommend these DVDs if you are at all interested in even a basic quality movie viewing experience."
4,Always loved it,I've always loved the songs on this album and am happy to get them on my new Galaxy S3. Nice!
5,Finally...,"I am a huge 3 Doors Down fan and have been to 2 of their concerts so I was really looking forward to this CD so I went out and bought it the day it came out. I was blown away by the live version of Here Without You the first time I heard it. Here Without You is such a great song because I think just about everyone can relate to it (I know I can). I have to say that for under $10 it is quite a good CD (meaning every song on it is good) and I definitely recommend that if you like 3 Doors Down, rock music, or #1 hits (there are 1, 2, 3, 4, ah.. 4 #1 songs) that you buy it immediately either from right here or a store."
2,Good concept wasted on crappy script and acting,"The concept of the movie was intelligent, but the concept was wasted on horrible acting and not a very good script or well enough developed plot. I rented the movie because Mischa Barton was in it, and it looked like it was interesting. Well, there's a reason this movie isn't all that widely known. I wish the concept was saved for good actors and a good script who could've made the movie really hit home. It is a movie people can relate to, and it is good in a satirical sense - but if the creators were not trying to make a satire, wow it sucks more than i thought. Teenage girls can relate because it's a movie about finding yourself, but it could've been done in a much better way."
4,Swain ..,"Once again Dominique Swain graces herself in this strange film that revolves around snobby private school brats. The movie is neither heavy nor deep, rather just a dark story well executed by most of the cast. It is that rare film that starts at the end and slowly works its way back, and everything makes sense. I guess this film is shocking, to American standards, it touches on some subjects the typical teen films have never approached-it is definitely not for the sheltered. I enjoyed watching it and will undoubtedly watch it again. The version I have is the one released in Hong Kong, hopefully the American release will have better features. The film moves at a decent pace, never too slow nor too fast, and is overall entertaining."
1,Painful,"From the cover, this movie looked like a fun mixture of Cruel Intentions and Metropolitan. No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the ""fun, crazy"" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill. Stay away."
1,"I don't know what I was hoping for, but this wasn't it...","The premise of the movie sounded pretty interesting. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I decided to give it a chance, even when it got boring. It's not that I have a problem with kids on drugs and having sex, it's that I have seen this movie before, and it's called ""Bully."" (Not only because of the repeated actors and actresses, Bijou Phillips and Brad Renfro, but because of the repeated subject matter) Plus, if that was the kind of movie it was going to be, that would have been fine, but it was almost as if it was trying to be deep with the internal monologue of the main character. Yuck. Be what you are. The writing was bad and completely unrealistic....I just felt like the characters weren't developed enough, and if the scene actually started to produce something good, it never went anywhere. Blah. The End"
2,"Really that bad?! Worse, is more like it.","I thoroughly enjoyed Domonique Swain in Lolita, and some of her other small parts. I despised this movie. The story line was incomplete, the importance of certain parts exaggerated (or unexplained), and the plot non-existent ... So many things leave you with a complete blank. I enjoyed the performance of Bijou Phillips, and that was about it. By the end, when you are expecting SOMETHING significant to explain so many things, it ends. No great loss. By the time it ends, I was completely ready for the torture to stop. Yech!"
1,Hugely Disappointing,"Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of ""Beyond Valley of the Dolls"" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... ""I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet."" ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it."
5,Grotesque Blu-ray DVD Combo,This is not a movie for the weak. This takes a lot to watch and I would not watch this with anyone who was not willing to know what was in it. A friend and I watched it. we both liked it and considered it a Mans Romance movie. The movie is nothing but torture. It tests the limits and the love one may have for another. How far would you be willing to go for the one you love types of movies.
2,Graphic and dull,"A Japanese entry into the torture porn genre is more graphic yet at the same time less powerful (not to mention entertaining) than similar Western movies, like Saw, Hostel or a Serbian Film. A psycho who dresses as a doctor (and strongly resembles a young Takeshi Kitano) kidnaps a young couple and subjects them to all sort of degrading tortures. There is at least one powerful erotic scene as the captor fondles the bound captive girl genitals during several minutes. And there is an outrageous ending that resembles the ending of some of Takashi Miike's films. But for most of the time, I found this film pretty dull."
1,Way to small,"I do not have a thick mattress and these did not fit. First time I ever had this happen, sheets are usually way to big for my bed. I ordered 2 sets so I could put one fitted on my box frame and it did not even fit that. Plus I ordered it in black and the stiching is in white."
5,A outstanding Sci-Fi Series and story too,I read this whole series many years ago and have been seeking to get the whole series again. I lost them when I moved. can wait to repurchase them. I've waited a long time. I wish some day they would make a movie of this like the Star Wars movie. it's a better story.
3,CatToy,"Our cat liked the toy for the first day, but then got bored with it. She ended up breaking the wand. The toy was not very sturdy and it did not have enough power when spinning."
1,"If you like reading lies and misconceptions about Jews, and believe in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, then this is for you","This book was banned in the USA and was suppossed to be banned by Amazon. It is a lie, a hate filled book that was used by White Nazi's and anti Semites to make them feel superior and justify their hatred of the the Jewish people. It is a sick, hate filled book, that inflames blood libel and hatred of a people. It is a book that should be destroyed, as it has no place on the shelves of a library, unless you idolize Adolf Hitler , and the KKK."
2,Little Mammoth is better,"I bought this video for my son because I was looking for a child-level introduction to the some of the things I find interesting. My son does enjoy this video but I feel that he doesn't need to be exposed to the pointless, foolish humor used throughout. There are some good scenes in this video. One of Dave running alongside a Saturn 5 rocket really gives a sense of the scale, but why give a visual explanation of how an astronaut uses a toilet? If you're looking for a good video for kids that introduces them to the space shuttle and rockets I would recommend The Big Space Shuttle by Little Mammoth Media."
1,Left hungry,"This ecological morality play is standard Star Trek fare taken... nowhere new at all. Strange NEW worlds, people. That's what this is all about. Power Hungry uses the old ""split-em-up"" stand-by to place Riker on the ""rebel"" side while the rest of the crew negociate with the government of a planet that ruined its own eco-system. The conflicy between the two factions is tired material by now, and the supporting character brought in to fix their problems is odd and difficult to take seriously. Pass."
2,"Remember, a title does not have to be a description","Unfortunately the genious above(steven stevenson) did not read the editorial review or have any idea that perhaps music CD titles might have names that dont necessarily describe the nature of the work. However, as far as the music goes, check it out if you are into minimal, linear, and boring(to me) electronic noise that doesnt develop into anything interesting. If you are into complex, advanced, multidimensional sound that tickles all of your senses, seek anything on Seamless Records, Incipient records, The ORB, Amon Tobin, Squarepusher, Anything on Interchill records, Plaid, anything on Dragonfly records/Liquid Sound Design. If you are looking for comedy, read the editorial review, or listen to a sample, or simply know the comedian-- before you buy!"
4,Silly but very enjoyable romantic comedy,"Salman Khan sweetly plays the smitten lover of the ever charming Kajol, but the couple must hide their love from the girl's overprotective brother. Typical of Bollywood masala, it has a little of everything for everybody - romance, comedy, singing, dancing, and of course the usual Indian fight scene (more comic than graphic in my opinion) to unite the good guys against the bad guys and establish the hero's victory. It is definitely suitable for the entire family, and everyone who watches will surely find something to laugh about. My mom, my sister and I all smiled, laughed and giggled throughout the film."
3,A good overview,"This book is a really good overview of the all DI workflow, even if DI is evolving everyday. It gives a good understanding of the all process. My only regret is that it doesn't go ""deeper"" in the explanations (ie: Ok, a LUT is a LUT but it could have been useful to show examples) , staying at the ""surface""..."
5,5 pounds in three weeks,"This game (if you can call it that) provides the most intense, well-rounded workout you could you could ever dream of performing in your living room. I'm currently on week four of the six week challenge and have lost 5 pounds. If you want something that will kickstart you into good shape, this is the game for you. There are different levels of intensity to choose from so you can start at any level. There are a multitude of half hour workouts that target certain areas and you can alternate them daily. It also has a fitness journal that is very easy to use and helpful for your progress. This is the most important video game I've ever purchased.Gameplay is good, I've run into a few technical errors that are inconvenient, but nothing too bad."
2,painful,I did not like this one more than the original. I find it hard to use. The avatar is moving when you are not and not moving when you are. Working out is a pain already and this makes it even more painful. I wish I would have saved my money. They really need to work on the timing of this product. Also the avatars voice and lecturing on your movements can be annoying.
5,I LOVE this Workout Game!,I own the original EA Active and enjoyed that so bought this one to have some change to my workouts. I was pleased with the changes made in this game such as the graphic changes and the warm up and cool down being added to the workouts. I also like that you decide what days you want to work out during the week which was not an option in the original Active game. I get a great full body workout and this is excellent for beginners or people that excersise regularly.
5,Awesome!,"I purchased the Wii Active More Workouts after a couple of 30 day challenges with the Wii Active. I must say the More Workouts is awesome! The repetitions are faster so unlike with the Wii Active, I don't find myself getting bored and frustrated with the speed. The activities are more fun and fast paced. Where the inline skating got boring after a while because really its just doing loooooong squats and jumps it has been replaced with a surfboard activity where you are squatting, jumping, and moving your arms. It requires serious attention and keeps your heart racing. I did increase the resistance band by replacing it with a pilates heavy resistance band which really helps take the workout to the extreme. I like this more than the Wii Active initial game which I still liked a lot but the changes in this game just make it more active and fun. Two thumbs up!"
5,Awesome workout.,"This ""game"" provides an excellent workout. I got this over Christmas because I was feeling a little run down. I was concerned about 2 things when I bought this. One was that it would not be challenging enough for a guy in ok shape but just haven't been active for a while. And 2 that it would be too much like wii fit which did not provide a great workout. I'm happy to say I was wrong on both counts. This game definitely provides a great structured workout leading you every step of the way. And it can provide a ""tough"" workout. I can say that I felt results in just a week. So if you have no time, energy, motivation, or cash to go to a gym, this really can be the next best thing."
3,Readable but Ultimately Forgettable,"Think students shouldn't review textbooks? Why not? They're the ones who have to read them.This book is surprisingly readable given the potential for boredom in a subject like argument. Unfortunately, there is a tendency towards memorizing new vocabulary without much in the way of applying the concepts.The essays in the book, intended as examples, vary widely in quality. This would be okay, if the intention were to show examples of quality as opposed to examples of ARGUMENT.I voluntarily used this book once, to brainstorm for an essay in another class. That's the only reason I didn't rate it lower."
1,Unsatisfied,I'm trying to find the web site to register my product and no-one can find it. The site I'm looking for is www.register.InterActAccessories.com and it cannot be found just like when I tried finding a site to down load the drivers for an Interact Joystick
1,Not What I Hoped For,"I bought this for use in a sump tank for a 180gal fish tank. At three feet of head I calculated my flow rate at 750gal/hr. After one year and regular maintenance, my flow rate is down to around 300al/hour. I have been disappointed with this product overall, and I'm now looking into a different pump for my tank."
5,Great Fun,"I got this for my 14 month old grandbabies who love books. Great pictures and touch and feel for every double page. At first the girls would just touch the fuzzy, furry, or bumpy area on each page. Now they have great fun tickling all the animals. They are even using the new skill of 'tickle fingers' for other things like waving and tickling Grammy."
5,Great video for 2 year old,"My two year old has been obsessed with Paul O. Zelinsky's book for a long time now. He gets so excited to have someone look at it with him. He'll play with it by himself and he carries it around with him. When he saw the book come to life on this video he was awestruck, it is very true to the book. He plays it over and over and over. He has started to branch out and likes Dem Bones and the one about the little girl who wants a dog. This has been a great buy. Very happy with it."
5,Great DVD!,"My son saw this version of ""Wheels on the Bus"" on TV and loved it! It's realxing and he would often fall asleep to it. When we got the DVD and he started watching all of the other songs, he grew to love them all. Not an annoying type of DVD for adults :)"
5,Fantastic!,Great book--came in a timely fashion in great shape! Have a great day today and every day. I can't think of any more words!
4,Great true-to-life deep-sea adventure,"If you love maritime history and deep-sea adventure, this bookis a great place to learn about the most prolific oceanexplorer of our time, Dr Robert Ballard. Since her sinking,the Titanic had hidden in the depths of the Atlantic, never to be found,the experts said. But Dr Ballard had the drive to use thenewest technology and modern techniques to search for and surveythis famous ship. This book is a fascinating first-handaccount of the difficulties inherent in deep-sea explorationbut proves that maritime history can be unlocked from thedeep. Read this book and learn more about the single mostimportant maritime discovery in our time."
1,why didnt ballard take a artifact from the wreck?,"i never could make sense of why he didnt take a single plate or shoe from the wreck,then the wreck would belong to him,, to save or salvage as he saw fit.instead he took nothing,so that other guy ""salvager"",(forget his name) went down and took a few things,and then by law,the wreck belonged to him,to salvage or close off as a memorial,, whatever he saw fit to do with.far as i know,its salvage S.O.P. to ALWAYS bring back up some item or two,so you have the legal right to lay claim to the wreck. to my knowlage,this is the first time ballard didnt lay claim to the ship HE discovered.in fact,i never heard of this being done before by ANY SALVAGE TEAM,,,who would mount an expadition costing millions to find a ship,just to leave it and let someone elese have all the goodies, relics,gold,silver,jem stones,jewelery?,,,the list is endless, not counting historical artifacts.it makes no sense at all.am i missing anything? or am i just to suspicious?Roy"
3,"Decent sound, bad fit","These are OK, but I always feel like they're about to fall out of my ears unless I keep my head ABSOLUTELY STILL. Makes for a tough train ride when every little movement tugs the earphones out."
5,Tejano Empire fills the gaps left behind by Texas History.,"Tijerina states that, ""Tejanos founded the ranching frontier on their land grants... were the founders of the State of Texas"". I agree that only Tejanos have lived and fought under six flags and that Tejanos are here to stay. Tejano Empire is a bold book, well documented, and difficult to lay aside once opened by a reader. Stories handed down for generations are finally put into print. Beasley's sketches depict tejano stories that will live forever. Bravo - Andres Tijerina and thank you."
4,Nice Overview,"Peter Vronksy's ""Serial Killers"" is a good overview of serial killers and what makes them tick. The book is filled with case studies of famous serial killers, as well as some thumbnail sketches of less famous killers. To be honest, I would have been more interested in reading about the lesser-known killers, as yet another retelling of Ted Bundy isn't really needed at this point. The first chapter of the book is fairly boring, filled with statistics and conjecture. The book picks up speed toward the middle and doesn't really slow down from then on out. My stomach turned at some of the descriptions of victims in the book, and I realized that perhaps I learned more about some of these killers and their deeds than I had wanted.A warning: there are some very graphic photos in the middle of the book that I now wish I hadn't seen as they are very explicit. You may want to skip the picture section if you are squeamish."
1,Absolutely NO Technical Support and Useless Owner's Manual,"Decent enough saw.However, just try ... I mean try, to contact Hitachi's technical support. I've sent twenty emails ... one a day ... NONE are answered or even acknowledged.I just need to know how to ""true"" the bevel.The owner's manual does not include this information. It does not even address squaring the fence. However, even a blind monkey can figure that out.But, keeping the blade, in bevel, at the stops ... one needs to know what screw/bolt/setscrews maniupulate that.Without that information ... saw is pretty much useless for finish workSo, buyer beware"
2,Duran Duran can't ride that wave,"Duran,Duran once had catchy hooks,Vocals&were doing some alright music.but fast foreward to now&it isn't the same or even close to they way it once was.Problems starts with the band.John taylor had a Major Impact on their Material.Believe it or not Duran Duran were once considered alot like these Boy Bands of today but they re-Focused themselves&Made themselves better Artists.but this isn't a Good Record.Pretty predictable&safe."
2,Pop Trash is Garbage,"Pop Trash is a very accurate name for this album as my CD is headed straight for the garbage. This release sounds more like a sophmoric effort than a well developed musical montage from an experienced band like Duran Duran.Although if you enjoyed the techno pop of Medazzaland, than you may get some enjoyment from this album. It incorporates this previous sound and peppers it with heavier guitar rifts and some goofy type of talk-singing. This works for some of thier songs, such as Last Day on Earth, but it doesn't cut it for others, like Hallucinating Elvis.All in all this is only for the die hards, and I am not sure how many are still out there."
2,"Hopeful, but disappointed","I had not been tremendously impressed with any album since 7 & the Ragged Tiger until the Wedding Album came along. Such a great album, and still one of my favorites. Medazzaland was quite disappointing, but I was hoping Pop Trash would redeem them. It didn't. I was really pulling for them on this one! I think the main reason why they've taken a turn downhill is their loss of John Taylor in the band. This album isn't horrible. It's just not as good as I know they are. Mars Meets Venus is a great song. Someone Else Not Me is a good one too. But the rest are a little flat. A lot of track skipping going on. Guess it's back to the old stuff again!"
4,Bought it for a friend...,"I assume that they liked it, since they read the whole book in under two days. I'm not completely familiar with the Forgotten Realms cast of characters, but I am familiar with Ed Greenwood's writing. I'd certainly recommend this."
3,Seven Sisters Under the Microscope,"It's a book for those interested in the characters of the seven sisters; otherwise the suspension of disbelief is precarious and a dissapointment awaits at the end. Ed Greenwood has written much better, unfortunately the seven sisters can really only collectively be found in this collection of novellas."
2,Silverfall Not for the Newcomer,"The history of the seven sisters led me to buy this book, and I had high hopes of discovering the mystery, and attraction that surrounds them. The book was a muddled disappointment, and I was just happy to be finished with it. The story immediately grabbed me, but then i am a sucker for the Drow. The thought of Drow infiltrating, and attempting to take over a town through magical guises was original. Sadly the story gets bogged down in too many characters, and an over abundance in the claok-and-dagger. The ending I thought fell flat, and left me very disappointed in the resolution of the story. If you are a Greenwood fan then my review is moot, but if you are a first timer to the words of the Forgotten Realms. Please pick another book, and not this one."
1,Very bad messages,"There are some interesting lessons to be learned in this film. If you're father needs surgery so that he can walk again, it's okay to: 1) lie to your best friends and make them think that you're in love with them; and 2) rob a bank.This is one of the most morally bankrupt films I've ever seen that isn't *trying* to slosh about in the ethical gutter (i.e., some ""adult"" films - this is a kids movie, after all). How in the world could a parent allow their child to rob a bank and not punish that child? Even more - how could a parent watch this movie with their child and then recommend it? The absurdity of that is mind boggling.I'll admit that there are fine acting performances here. Kristen Stewart seems to be destined for greatness, as she continues a streak of steady performances begun in The Safety of Objects.But no acting can get past the unconscionable messages this movie sends to kids."
1,Lies lies lies!,this movie was based on lying. It was horrible! it was not better than cody banks or spy kids.
4,I like her style,"If you need to listen something different, this is one for you. For people who know her older albums, this one is not that great, however i like it."
3,Great concerto.,"For this concert I name three recordings: Kissin/Kitaenko (what was I doing when I was 12?), Argerich/Abbado and Pollini/Kletzki. The concert is superb and he gets all the stars, nothing more needs to be said. Two stars are lost because of the other works. The nocturnes are pretty good and the ballad. But the polonais Op. 53 is lifeless. Funny as it is I often find Pollini (the yongest to win the Chopin competition) short of edge in his chamber Chopin. I don't quite know what it is but there is something missing here. So the rest isn't on the same level as the concert. But as a Pollini fan in gener I find this my favorite recording of the concert. (I would rate the disc three and a half but that's not possible)"
1,The Worst Recording of the Bach Cello Suites,"This has to be one of the worst recordings of the Bach Cello Suites on the market. His playing is out of tune, and the fluffy sound he gets in so many places gives the recording an overall bad sound. I would suggest Yo Yo Ma's first recording of this as an alternative. However, the over all style is on this recording is very good, but is overshadowed by the intonation."
2,Ok,The book is OK. But i think if your going to right a book about these guys you should at least know the facts! Scotts name is Scott James Tim not Scott Timothy James and his Bday is on the 22nd of November not the 27th! But I guess its ok because it has good pictures and SOME correct information.
5,oh this book is wicked,"Its so great it has everything. i lost mine but i had read it and i love it.It has everything, from when J first moved to now. Its the greatist"
3,Could have been better,"I won't go into detail about the plot since other reviewers have already done a good job with the recap. As always, Elizabeth Chadwick does a great job illustrating the early turbulent period in the English history. However, where I felt let down was the underlying plot relating to Oliver and Catrin. Maybe it was the author's attempt to not be lumped into the history romance category, but I felt the sudden resurrection of the long-dead husband was a red herring thrown in to create a non-existent conflict. For Catrin, who otherwise is strong and intelligent, to make such a stupid choice based on adolescent feelings was out of character. Also, regardless of his being her husband, it felt wrong to have her succumb to his seduction so immediately after years of absence, especially coming on the heels of her supposed devotion to Oliver. The rich history setting made up somewhat for this misstep."
1,Just junk,"This is one of the useless maps I've ever bought.Roads are not distinguished by importance, so it is hard to find the highways. Type is so small even a young man could not read it. Symbols are overlapped by text and impossible to locate correctly.This map is an example of a company that bought a GIS system, but obviously does not know how to use it (the country seems squashed - and does not have the slightest idea of how to make maps.Do not waste your money on this junk."
2,"Part 4, shopworn and formulaic.","My big quibble with Soul Harvest was just how closely it followed the event outline of Nicolae. Buck saves Chloe from harm, then runs off to save someone else. Meanwhile Rayford continues to spy on Nicolae and seek out the newly saved. The intrigue heats up and the nastier bits of the tribulation are yet to come, but did Jenkins have to gloss over plagues in mere paragraphs? And just how long is he going to drag these events out? Questions I would not be asking if he spent more time developing three dimensional and complex characters to inhabit this hellish world. I wasn't exactly bored with the novel, but I was far from impressed. I'll get around to reading part 5 someday, but I'm rapidly loosing interest in this seemingly endless series since it obviously has nothing for its characters to do."
3,"Some interesting concepts to consider,but POOR Writing.","The authors wrote about some topics that are fairly controversial. It made me think. However I don't see this poor example of Christian authors getting any awards or standing out in the world of literature. It sounded like a movie made into a book. Not much creativity seems to go into this series, the authors tend to have a lot of talking and rehashing of old events. Not a way to keep readers."
4,"A return to the fast pace of the first two novels, Superb!","I thoroughly enjoyed the fast past of this lastest novel in the left behind series. All main characters have ever changing roles still focused on thier faith and beliefs on God and his judgments. It was yet another quick read, (two nights!) I can hardly wait for the next segment."
3,Review#234,"""Transfer-the end of the beginning"" by Jerry Furland is a much better read, makes a lot more sense, and the best part, it is probably exactly where we are headed in the year 2009. You decide."
3,Slow......Again,"Ok the first book was good, the second slow, the third one picked up for me and now, I'm having hell (pardon) getting thru this one. Last book we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where Buck and Rayford were and now we are looking for Chloe and Amanda. I think it's becoming a bit repetitive, but hopefully it speeds up again."
3,"Good spirituality, but poor writing","As far as Judgment Day novels go, this pales in comparison to such soul-rattling books as Kleier's THE LAST DAY. The characters in HARVEST are weakly developed and the storyline feels contrived, artificial. Each book in the LEFT BEHIND series seems to lose more steam. For harder-edged, more reality-based suspense, read Kleier."
4,The Good and the Bad,"This book is definately not as deliciously suspenseful as the second book, but I found a few of the plot twists very good. The overall message is of course one of Christianity prevailing and that's always uplifting to read. I'm definately hooked on the series now, for better or for worse! I think the only thing that I can say I didn't like about this book is that the writers have a tendency to use the same phrases over and over. I think they get bored and either need to make the books shorter, or get more creative. All in all, much better than the third and a very entertaining book."
5,I was very impressed,I had thought this one would be a bit of a yawner; I was wrong. This is the best book so far in the series. I really liked the way the action cut back and forth between the main characters and their equally tense situations. Quite a bit was revealed that I didn't expect. The series is taking some very imaginative turns. I felt much closer to the characters and the sorrows of the world. The dissection of politics among the anti-christ and his followers is masterful. I had never understood why he kept Rayford Steele around so long until it made sense later in the book. I must admit I didn't see that one coming. I was surprised with the ending of the scuba diving expedition and have many unanswered questions in regards to what they found. Now I've got to read the next book!
3,Series is wandering away from original premise,"I flew through ""Soul Harvest"" in four days, but that did not mean I was not disappointed with its flat characters and weak plot. The series started out so well, with the fascinating concrete illustration of such cosmic, abstract events like the Rapture and the rise of the Anti-Christ. But in ""Soul Harvest"", Jenkins and LaHaye have let their characters direct the action, and the book degenerated into a sappy melodrama. Everyone knows the characters all hate Carpathia and he is evil, so the authors don't need to dwell on that point every single time Carpathia appears in the series.I hope the next books return to the profound, strong depictions of epic events. I will finish the series regardless of how well the books are written, but I hope my disappointment ends with ""Soul Harvest""."
3,Whoosh!,"Quick read-total fantasy. Does not compare to well to ""Transfer"" by Jerry Furland. But, it is a profoundly religious book and for that it will have some positive effect on open minded readers."
4,"Quality story, average writing","I must say, this series has captivated me. Not because of the writing, but because of the content of the story. The end times are fascinating and this book brings them to life. That's why I enjoy them so much. People need to stop criticizing the authors for their writing style and enjoy the story. Sure, I am also annoyed by many things in the book, but I am able to look past the trivialites and enjoy the big picture. I am starting Apollyon today."
1,unknown,"As of November 2 this is only one star as it was said to ship on October 3 with estimated delivery of 14 October. As of now I haven't received it, nor is the USPS showing anything more than notification that it is due to be delivered to them."
5,The Little Match Girl,In The Little Match Girl by Hans Christian Andersen the little girl had only a little money and she uses her matches to keep warm throughout the story. I like this book because the character she shows her feelings. I think you should always be thankful for what you have.
2,"Fast Shipping, but i would recommend the original tacky glue.","Fast Shipping, but i would recommend the original tacky glue. Even though it says clear the original tacky glue also leaves a clear mark. It was really messy since the container was way softer than the origional tacky glue one."
3,incest and ufo's,Richard Wright is a very talented writer. I would compare him to some of my other favorites like Denis Johnson and Chuck Palanhniuk. This book is probably not his best but due to his excellent writing style its worth a read. I won't give any plot summary other than to say this story follows a husband and wife team of ufologists and their inbreed family. The book loses its focus towards the end and some major plot holes are left unanswered. But if you like any of the afformentioned authors I'd check this book out.
3,O-kay. Hmmmmmmmm...,"I don't know if I love or hate this book. I'm 11, and it might be better for a 13-15 year old to read it.Molly gets drunk twice. She has sex. She cusses. Her friend Jane takes off her shirt at a party and is taking pills and constantly having sex. Their manager, Paul, kisses Molly and threatens to kill her. Molly and Dean are always sleeping together.But it all offers a message.Overall, I think it was good, but it would have been better if I'd have waited till I was older."
5,rock on,"Molly, Jane, and Tara are determined to be a part of the girl revolution. They get some instruments, teach themselves three cords, and are ready to rock. At one of their first gigs, they meet Dean. He has the nerve to tell them they need improvement, and basically forces himself and his pal, T, into the band. The Hormones are born. Despite the fact that Molly and Dean hate each other, the band hits it big. The Hormones become a huge hit, traveling the world. They are living the good life of rock and roll excess-- on the outside. The truth is that Tara and T don't talk, except to each other. Jane is battling addictions of all kinds. Molly is being threatened and manipulated by their manager, Paul, and she has to hide the one bright spot in her life: her relationship with Dean. Will Molly hit superstardom, or will she lose herself completely, and crash and burn?"
3,Good book bad editing,I have bought several books from Amazon over several years and have always been very pleased with the quality of the publishing. However this book is horrendous the amount of misspelled words almost make it unreadable!! I will be careful not to order plain covered books again.
2,Una revista mas...,"Libro muy basico, lo compre pensando que explicaba a fondo todo lo relacionado con base de datos y en realidad parecia una revista de esas que se compra en un quiosco.No se a quien le puede interesar."
4,very good book for film buffs,I bought this book at Barnes & Noble not too soon after it came out. I really like it and would recommend it to anyone who is a film buff like me. It may not be the best reference book for movies and films but it is a little fun top 10 lists of movies to look at if you're bored or whatever.
5,The best workouts ever.,"I own every FIRM workout video. After doing them steadily for one summer, I was and am fitter than after years of other videos, running, and lifting. If you really do what they tell you to, it will make a difference."
4,Great price and decent quality,These are nice fog lights. I replaced the original equipment ones in my 2001 Chevy Silverado after the lenses had fallen out of both of them. The assembly fits without an issue and includes a new bulb. The only issue I see is that the fog lights vibrate a bit on rough roads. The brackets on these lights are not as strong as the ones on the original fog lights and for that reason I am rating them a 4.
4,Great replacement for OEM.,"If you have these on your truck and live in the north were I do, you WILL break one. The oem part is expensive. This is a good direct fit replacement but not oem. It too is not of good build quality but niether is the oem one. They really don't even work well under normal use. They came with my truck when I purchased it. So if you don't like driving around with one of your trucks eyes punched out, use this to replace it. Again they do not throw much light but the oem ones don't either."
3,Amazon sent wrong part,"All of my order paperwork said Drivers side light for 1999 Gmc but it was not the one that matched the factory one, so I had to modify it and make it work. VERY frustrating"
5,Love 'em!,"Learn several facts, or just one. These flash cards teach State names, shapes, capitals, and many other facts. A great tool for my third grader."
2,The Body in the Library,I was disappointed in this one. Other Agatha Christie books are more complicated and keep you guessing. This one was not that interesting. The characters were dull. Action was limited.
3,A Noticeable Dip in Quality,"Miss Marple's second outing seems a trifle tired. The writing appears forced at times, even repetitious, and there is too much foreshadowing. The ending is a long time in coming and stretches credulity. Not a bad book but certainly not in the same league with Agatha Christie's best works."
5,"Another ""Must Read"" by Miss Christie","Anything Agatha Christie writes is excellent. I've never read anything of hers that I disliked. I prefer Hercule Poirot books, but Miss Marple is also grand. You can't go wrong with Agatha!"
4,Cute & simple easy reading,"What can you say about agatha? Her writings are classic & her miss maples series are fun, easy reading with a hint of suspense"
5,The Body in the Library,Typical Agatha Christie. Keeps you guessing with multiple options for 'Who did it?' I would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a good mystery.
4,great value,"this mower has no extras, but it's a solid machine.The engine has plenty of power to mow my st. augustine lawn. so far, it's been smooth and reliable.out of the box, the wheels had to be straightened into proper alignment, which i did by hand. otherwise, no complaints."
1,"What's the point of ""Unrated""","I'm not sure which versions other reviewers are seeing, but mine from Blue Underground is ""Unrated"". I guess this is because they really didn't want people to know it should have been rated PG-13. If women in panties and fuzzy breast shots are your thing, then get this movie. Half the fun of campy women in prison movies is naked women. The other half is following along with a silly plot. This movie was boring on both accounts."
2,not,"this movie is ok. if it would of developed the charaters better then it sowuld of been a good movie but it didn't so its not a vey good movie. the acitn is good so that is a plus but other than that the movie isn't what you would expect it to be at all. I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone that likes suspence movies, or andy kind of movie"
1,Please do your homework screenwriter,"This movie might have been mildly entertaining if the person who wrote it had done a minimal amount of research on intellectal property, which was the gist of the story. Instead, it was ludicrous. What about getting a patent for the big secret? You wouldn't get a copyright, it's a PROCESS!! For god's sake, get a consultant the next time you delve into such issues or at least do 5 minutes of research. A stupid movie."
1,"HORRIBLE. A FAKE, nothing more.","I've watched ""GLENGARRY GLENN ROSS"". It is very slow-paced, but since the first minute you can almost feel yourself in the skin of a salesman with nowhere to sell his products, on the verve of loosing his job. The actor are splendid (Pacino, Lemmon, Ed Harris, what more do you want). But in this ""SPANISH PRISONER"", look at the cast: it is simply bad directed by the same director. Campbell is horrible, nothing in him. Martin is horrible also, everybody seems to be sleeping. Buta Mammet is Mammet, and he will always have good reviews from his blind fans."
1,"I'm out of words, so bad it is ...","Well, I think the bes thing I can suggest to you about his ""masterpiece"" is: watch and judge it by yourself... I'm out of words to describe for you how horrible this movie is, how arrogant the director was. This arrogance was translated into slowness, the movie never takes off..."
2,What's To Like?,"Not having seen all of Mamet's film's it would be unfair to say he's made only two good ones: ""House of Games"" and, especially, ""The Winslow Boy"". We just watched an intermittently interesting but ultimately mediocre Mamet effort, ""Heist"", so I went to Amazon.com to read some reviewers' opinions. The awarding of stars was more evenly divided than any set of reviews for any film I've checked. More interesting than that, however, was the fact that so many reviewers of ""Heist"" mentioned ""The Spanish Prisoner"" as an example of Mamet's better work. We have seen ""The Spanish Prisoner"" twice, the second time to try to find something that we might have missed the first time. Still don't get it. It is surface only, and an uninteresting surface at that. There's no apparent involvement on the part of the players/characters and little or no reason for the viewer to become involved either. The one extra star above the minimum merely means it wasn't offensive enough to hate."
3,"BELLO, MA NON TROPPO","Ho noleggiato questo film e devo dire che mi è piaciuto abbastanza. Dico ""abbastanza"" perché il film è molto intrigante, c'è una buona dose di suspance ma ci sono troppi tempi morti. Prima di entrare nel vivo occorrono 40 minuti di film: un po' troppi! Qui in Italia il film, al cinema, ha avuto scarsissimo successo: forse troppo poco perché comunque è un buon film."
1,"dull acting, dry writing","The plot was interesting, but it has to have been one of the dullest movies in a long time. The acting was flat with lines that are often cliched. I agree with previous reviewers that the actors seem as though they wish they were somewhere else. Especially irritating was the character of the young secretary. This film was a major disappointment that at first glance (and after reading reviews) seemed promising. Save your money."
3,Worth Seeing Once,"The movie is worth seeing but is very slow through most of it. The storyline was good and the ending was even better. But you have to stick it out to see the results. The transition from one scene to the next was technically primitive and almost annoying, but on a good note, I thought Campbell Scott and Steve Martin gave great performances."
1,Should have stayed as a play...,"I found this movie predictable, horribly acted, and not worth the time. Most of the actors (especially Steve Martin) have this look that they would rather be somewhere else and were reading the lines straight from the script. The plot itself was easily predictable and it was obvious where it was headed. The scenery was horrible and looked as if it came right from the stage. As a play this would be an excellent way to spend some time. As a movie? Horrible."
4,Outstanding,"...An excellent film about a con game/sting. Unfortunately, it gets a little too complicated and baffling for me later in the plot. Steve Martin does very well in a non-comedy role....High marks on the entertainment barometer...almost a must see..."
4,good sheets,"I like these sheets, the only thing is they are heavy, so I'm going to wait till winter when it gets cold to put them back on the bed."
4,Generous fitted sheet,"I have a very high pillow top mattress and the fitted sheet is generous enough to fit it with no problem....however, the reason for the 4 stars is that the top sheet seems very short and not quite wide enough...also I think the pillowcases could add another inch to the length. Overall I would buy these again...because they were soft and a great value."
5,Love them!,"I recieved my order, as always, in a very timely fashion and am very pleased with the quality.Teresa Headington RN"
3,Ring rubber broke fairly quick,Overall the effect of the Hot Hand is pretty awesome and I was using it pretty regularly but then the Rubber on the hot hand ring broke after a month of steady use. I've contacted Source Audio before asking just simple questions about their products and got almost immediate responses but when I tried contacting them again in regards to the ring breaking I got absolutely no response.The other complaint I have about the product is the actual wireless adapter itself has trouble staying in the back of my pedal. It is really easy to get it out of position/skewed to the point that it makes no electronic connection to the pedal. I.e. I walk away from the pedal board and a cable gets dragged into the adapter (lightly mind you) and it stops working. Extremely frustrating.
4,Must-have for Artists,"I love this book, and use it frequently. It's very comprehensive, and has lots of basic forms to cover a multitude of artist's needs. Not a replacement for legal advice, but very handy for day-to-day stuff."
3,No reponse to email,Package received on time but the disk included was shattered to bits. Emailed about replacement but have not yet received reply...
2,Format difficult to follow,The recipes require that you flip back and forth from one to another. Also some of the ingredients are not readily available. The food I am sure is delicious but I would not take the time the preparation requires.
1,TSA,The year is now 2009. Why is anyone making or selling hardside luggage without TSA approved locks? Hello? Hello?
5,Great replacement battery,"Purchased these to replace battery in spray sense collar, same as what came with the original product. Worked as expected. Saved me the time of having to go hunt one down. Thanks."
3,Decent book to learn Chess or to review key elements,The book was shipped fast. I knew it was a used book and overall it did come in good shape. It would have been better if most of it hadn't already been highlighted.
4,Mr. and Mrs.Eldon Conilogue/And their family of Cheyenne/Spent the weekend with Mr. and Mrs/Clarence Conilogue*,"Handsome if inconsequential tome from the days when men were men and chapbooks were chapbooks. What the world needs, I think we can all agree, is more found poetry* This Jamesian trifle, part of a longer suite, dates from 1967, not 1897. Wild, man"
1,Heavy-handed.,"I loved Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, and I have enjoyed some of his satires in the past. I didn't finish this book, and I am writing this only because I couldn't find a negative review to agree with. It is heavy handed satire with dull characters."
5,works great with Canon SD870IS,"Got this for my canon SD870IS compact camera. I'm not sure if I really needed the speed but the cost of this card wasn't much more than others and it came with a reader. I am happy with the video quality using this card as I use this camera for video as much as still. The only problem is the card reader doesn't fit into the recessed usb slots on the front of my comp (just need a usb extension cable), but downloading directly from the camera is still faster than my old cf card reader. I've only shot about 100 pics so far, but the card has worked flawlessly."
5,Solved my Camera Performance Problem,"I had unsatisfactory results from other so called ""Class 6"" SDHC cards in my camera when shooting HD video or continuous stills. Because the card could not accept data fast enough the camera would stop functioning and I would lose the video or some of the stills. Since switching to this card (which was recommended on a popular photography forum) my camera has performed flawlessly. Howver, it is not necessary to spend the extra money for this card if you don't use data intensive features. Single still photos with 10 MP point and shoot have been handled fine with any card I've tried so far."
3,Not what I expected,"My research indicated this high-performance card would shorten the time it takes between shots. Mine doesn't. It does increase the speed to download from the card to my hard drive, so for that I guess it was worth it."
1,WARNING,"The illustration shows the SDHC card with a plug in reader - IT DOES NOT COME WITH THE READER. Deceptive advertising in the least, especially since I found no other SDHC card shown with a reader."
5,Card great; card reader won't work,"The card does what it says and I would recommend it to anyone, but don't get it with the reader. I can't get Windows XP to recognize it and there is no driver to download from the Sandisk website for this particular reader."
3,"Good item at very good price, just not what I ordered","There seems to be a mixup in the system where the picture shows a class 10 card with 30MB/sec speed, but you receive a class 6 card with 20MB/sec speed. This happened twice and Amazon was very accomodating, but I hope the situation is resolved so others don't have to go through the same annoyance."
5,Simply Excellent,Never failed me and its sturdy!! Like the description says it can handle almost anything!!
4,Very nice combo for the price!,Not a lot to say about an SD card and reader but it's worth noting that this is money well spent. The card is solid and fast. The reader works well and comes with a nice little zipper pouch to protect both the reader and the card. Nicely done!
5,Sxtreme III Card with USB 2.0 = Excellent and Super Fast,I am a very skeptical person with other person's reviews but i believed everyone's comments and went ahead and bought this item. This is a super product. it is plug and play and it is super fast. i recommend it for the price it has. I bought it and took it to Europe where the process of returns is huge and very costly. No regrets! Great investment and thanks everyone for the fantastic reviews i read before i bought it! g3
3,The Great Wen in War,"A book for people who love London and its history, focused here in the critical year of 1945. Maureen Waller culls acounts from many sources to explain the often sad social realities that exisited in a large city torn by a war of horrifying effect and long duration. The book is best when explaining the specifics of the way people actually lived in this abnormal time, such as how food rationing was handled or children protected. Some of the redundent first person accounts could have been edited out without harming the thrust of this solid effort."
1,"The Pain, The Pain!","This book is mind-numbingly boring. Imagine a government bureaucrat listing out what was occurring in London category by category. This is worse.After getting about 2/3 of the way through chapter 1 I skipped and read 2 pages at random from the remaining chapters. She was consistent, consistently wooden insipid uninspired writing.My mom bought me this book... and I thought she loved me."
5,A Very Necessary Collection of Perspectives,"If I had come across this collection of fiction ten years ago, my teenage years would have been much, much less painful than they were. As a young gay Latino from a homophobic culture and in a racist environment, I needed to know that the voices of brown jotos were important enough to be expressed, written and certainly compiled in a book. There is much pain expressed in these stories, but also hope and redemption. Though these stories have come a little too late for me, it is heartening to know that they are now with us and that they are accessible to the young joteria."
2,Poor quality control,"I ordered this as a replacement toilet seat. It came, I installed it but failed to notice that one of the hinge pins was not seated all the way through thus the seat was not connected to the lid on one side and consequently, the seat swiveled. After trying to seat the pin through to the seat, I decided it could not be fixed, contacted Amazon and they kindly sent another. This one arrived with one of the pins not fully seated but nonetheless, working. However it was missing one of the necessary parts for installation. Fortunately, I had an extra part from my first order. So, two for two-the quality control is terrible. The seat I have cobbled together from the two, works and is fine. I am disappointed in Kohler; I thought they represented good, American, quality plumbing products."
5,Excellent!,"I love this movie, it's so many things at once. It's hilarious, dramatic, heart stopping, and exciting. All the actors/actresses worked together so well and really did make an amazing movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed the part of Hesher, playing a seriously amazing part. When they filmed this movie, they did do a really good job at catching TJ's confusion, anger and sadness. I absolutely LOVE this movie and I would recommend it to anyone."
2,too much perversion,"It was a great idea, with excellent acting, a well developed story, and a refreshing ending. But the pervasive use of the ""F"" word and other needless sexual references detracted from an otherwise excellent movie."
1,Terrible,"Having lived in the area during the shootings...this book was terrible.This ""Chief"" did not ""solve"" anything. The suspects were stopped numerous times, but he was too busy focusing on suspects that perhaps looked different, or more what he wanted them to look like.He is extrememly self-serving, and honestly wasn't very articulate (as people often say) or organized while dealing with the media...he was hostile and not very likeable actually. Not sure what the big deal with this guy is."
3,will the bigot stop trashing Chief Moose!,"It looks the same bigot wrote the same review over and over. Let's start with the incredible trash that Moose is personally responsible for the profile being the typical white sociopath who commits these acts. Everyone knows that the FBI hands out profiles in these types of crimes and they are usually very, very accurate. However, profiles only come from an analysis of history -- after the crimes are committed and solved. Now they have some new data points. But to blame Moose for it? That's why I know it is the same redkneck because so many of these scathing reviews blame Moose for the profile and for every mistake made by every law enforcement person. Jeez! Go get a life! Or better yet, go get some character."
3,pretty funny,"Funny and entertaining. However, they edited out some of the comics and no special features. Just rent it."
1,Not worth the time lost...,"I am a huge Jerry Lewis fan and this one is definitely not worth the time it takes to watch. Save yourself the trouble because you sit through it knowing his reputation (expecting so much better) and at the end of all of the nonsense all you can say is, ""Really? I mean, really?"" What a waste of film. There are so many movies he did that are soooo much better!"
5,All daughters should read this!,"My mother bought me this book when I was in the hospital to pass the time. I loved all three stories. I agree that Margot Early's story reveals the complex problems that arise from alcoholism, but to me it shows that love doesn't have to be perfect, and that we can make mistakes and still have happy endings. In fact, I thought it was the best story of the book. Both of the other stories show the struggle I think we all face to avoid being just like our mothers, until we realize we love our mothers, and being like them would not be such a bad thing."
2,Not worth it!,"Target Practice was one of the worst movies I have watched.Acting was poor, Plot was poor...a few action scenes kept it somewhat watchable and I wanted just to see how it turned out..however the ending was disappointing and horrible like the rest of the film."
4,Has a certain appeal in the genre,"'The Master Sniper' is a finely crafted novel, a very compelling tale much in the style of recent gems like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Black Notice"", or even books of a more techno-thriller bent like ""The Devil's Teardrop."" Four stars!"
2,NOt up to par,This is not up to Stephen Hunter's usual very high standards. I expected a lot more and until now he has never let me down.
2,Ho hum.,"The Master Sniper is not the greatest claim to fame for Stephen Hunter. If you can only read one Hunter book ... don't make it be this one. If there's no Swagger in it, it's not your first choice.This is a 'hardware' book, and it's so wrapped up in the nightscope-and-subsonic-ammunition gimmick that it doesn't really have the ring of authenticity that you'll find in, say, ""Point of Impact"". The folks who enjoy WWII spy adventures will be enchanted with it. But the PEOPLE who populate this book just don't seem as real as those which Hunter creates for the Swagger books.Jerry the (Buy it after you've bought all the Bob the Nailer books, though) Geek"
3,OK read but not among the best,"I agree with the author in his letter that in the book Master Sniper he is trying to create a believable character from the German point of view, which too many books failed to do. Stephen Hunter had certainly achieved his goal. Nevertheless as a thriller this book is not as fast paced as I would have liked to. This is NOT a criticism of the literary value of this book. Rather it is a simple statement from my own point of view. When I read a Crichton or a Dan Brown it typically took me no more than three days to finish it because I couldn't put it down. But this one took me 10 days or so to finish because it just did not have the same kind of edge."
4,A master story-teller.,"If you've not read any of Hunter's books before, start here. It's early Hunter, and it was the book which created his legions of fans.Fine storytelling, with a taut, credible plot, and good characterisation - that's ""The Master Sniper"". It's the basic chase story, using the Second World War as a back-drop, with an extraodinary man cast as the villain, and good ol' Joe Average as the good guy.History tells us that it was good ol' Joe Average ( a pretty amazing man ) who won the war in the Pacific and West Europe. And Hunter draws him here with sympathy and clarity.This is a very, very good book: but Hunter got better with his next book, then better with the next one, and so on. Start here, and read on...."
2,Alright....,This book is not bad but it was not as good as I thought it would be. For one thing it left you hanging as far as some of the characters went. Even though it was a WW2 story. It really did not seem like one to me. It lacked the feel of one.The plot was very unique as far as who the final target was. But otherwise it is the same old cat and mouse chase.Bottom line is I was very excited about this book because I like WW2 history. But this was kinda a let down
4,Not just for the gents!,"Although I'm not a man, I decided to try this shave gel when I noticed that the dyes and heavy fragrances in women's shaving creams were drying out my skin. I used Nivea for a couple of weeks and, voila, no more dry, itchy legs! I was able to get a close shave with no irritation. I also like its nice, clean scent. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the price. It's kind of expensive for drugstore shaving cream. But if you don't mind the price and have sensitive skin, then this is the shaving gel for you."
3,"Good, but not great","I recently started shaving. I used Edge Sensitive Skin. It was like putting lighter fluid on my face and lighting a match. So I bought this.First impression: Very, very thick. You nerd a little more water. It doesn't rinse well. It has an ok smell.Cons: Doesn't rinse well, burned my face a little.Overall, not bad, but my skin says no.I tried Edge Ultra Sensitive. No dyes or perfumes. NO IRRITATION! Great lubrication, closer shave."
5,Christmas by Alabama,"I first heard this album 3 or 4 season's ago and it is still my very favorite Christmas music. It really makes me stop and think about the true ""Reason for the Season"" I wore my tape out last year and was wanting to purchase a new one! I am so sorry it is out of stock."
5,Loved since childhood,I have loved this movie since I was a kid. Beautiful footage of the eagles is great with an adventurous plot line. Great for slightly older kids.
5,Excellent--not worth paying more than $18,"I assume the sellers are capitalizing on Jamie Foxx's notoriety and popularity. I HAD this CD over 8 years ago, but it's since disappeared. I saw his acting skills and heard the CD and realized he had musical skills too! I would like to replace it, but only at fair market value (<$20)."
1,FYI: geodes are supposed to be hollow & full of crystals,"Don't buy! Entire box was full of ""geodes"" that were solid brown. No crystals whatsoever. I purchased this as a fun activity for my niece & we were both disappointed. Geodes can be easily identified from solid nodules (also called thundereggs) by weight, which leads me to conclude seller is quite aware that these aren't geodes. Product page states "" Ninety percent (90%) of geodes are filled with beautiful crystals."" That is simply not true. I received a box of unremarkable rocks. Boo."
5,I got 10 Thunder rocks,"I got 10 Thunder rocks. Like a geode but solid most/all the way through,. Recomend rinsing first perhaps an old (trash)toothbrush"
1,bust!,there were no hollow centers in our box. but the boys still had fun because they got to use the hammer. i do not think i will recommend this item to anyone.
4,An important read that also entertains,"Oh, this was VERY good. And totally still applies today, sometimes shockingly so. A few times this felt dated, but mostly it was a very sharp, entertaining, poignant, and important essay. I enjoyed the format of both lectures quite a lot. The first was brilliant, following the day of one woman thinking about the issues of women and literature, and seeing that woman encounter all types of barriers in her everyday living. The second provided more of the ""meat and potatoes"" (the heart and facts) of the problems faced by women who wish to participate in literature. The fictionalized story of Shakespeare's sister was very powerful.I'll definitely be thinking about this for awhile."
5,Woolf is a Brilliant Writer,"This may be a longer essay than many may be used to reading, but it is worth reading! It is brilliant! That is practically the only word I can describe it by. Some of her best work/thoughts and quotes on literature is in this essay. If you are a fan of Virginia Woolf, you must read this. If you are just starting to read her writings, this is a great introducion to her work. If anything it will make you want to read more of her writings( which is exactly what happened to me after I read this!) !"
3,Came quickly but package was already ripped open,"I was surprised to have received this book so quickly, I was happy that I received it. However my happiness diminished a little when I collected the package from my mailbox....the packaging was ripped open half way its a miracle the book didn't fall out of it!"
2,A Room of One's Own,I found it tedious to read in spite of the high literary reputation and ability of Virginia Woolf. There must be something lacking in me.Edward Cook
5,Perfect,I read all the reviews for this item before I decided to place my order. I am glad I did because this item does run smaller. My grandaughter loved it.
2,Girls petticoat full slip.,I followed the advice of previous reviews and purchased the slip a little larger. The slip runs very small! I had no problems with it at all.
5,The best album by Professor Longhair.,"This album is by far the best Professor Longhair album on the market today. This is based on the fact that George Winston and Dancing Cat Records, have put in the time and effort to ensure a A+ recording. There are others version of the same songs out there by this master of the NO piano, however the sonic of them do not compare to this one. Thank you Mr. Winston. You have given this great musican a testiment that is worth it grain in salt."
3,The ending killed me!,"I found this book very interesting. I found it interesting because I can not wrap my brain around the fact that this girl did not try to escape and just amazed at how much mind control this man had over her. They did not touch on it but I can not believe that this girl would allow these horrible things to happen to her and not try to get away. This tells me she was very damaged before she was kidnapped.As you read on it becomes more and more apparent that this girl was completely lost and had no sense of self worth. This leads me to believe that she did at some point willingly stay. She felt no other belonging. The ending absolutely sucks! The entire ending was so rambling, twisted and tied up in legal mumbo jumbo that I found myself trying to skip chapters so that I could get past it. This was a descent book for a rainy day."
4,Scary!,"I read this book a few years ago, and I could still remember clearly how chilling this story was. The young woman who was kidnapped by the nerdy looking man while his wife and child were in the car made you realize that everything isn't always what it seems. I recently saw this story profiled on ""American Justice"" and it was amazing...."
5,Super clear and simple!,"These are great! My wife's eyesight is not good and is different in each eye, but we can share these binoculars and never have to readjust or focus! Everything is crystal clear no matter where you look. It's amazing how they work."
2,"Good binocular, didn't work for me","The Perma Focus didn't always work for my left eye and there is no ""manual focus"". They only worked sometimes."
3,motown the early years,"the video was ok,but i thought it would be the stars singing their songs when they were young,not a concert of them singing now.That's what i was really looking for.The title was misleading."
4,Fairly well done,"To start, It was a made for TV production. So lots of the elements from the book were toned down if not removed. That's expected so otherwise well done.Little to medium things are changed and edited to speed the pacing, again expected considering the length of the book. A few large story items are changed, such as the henry bowers character is much less filled out in the movie.The child actors seem to be a little rough at performing in the beginning but they get much better as it continues. My opinion about the adults is the same. Both of these complaints mainly come the character Bill, stutters being difficult to portray convincingly.All together I enjoy the book and do enjoy this movie. Fun to watch them come together as kids and make tougher journey of reconnecting again as they're older.This DVD is a double sided disc and flipping it half way through is necessary. It's not so bad since being a two part miniseries there is an obvious break point."
5,The Killer Clown strikes again...and again...and again....,"Is it the supernatural? Satan himself? The old monster in the closet? Richard Thomas' character doesn't know but it took his little brother and left him and his friends of a small, Maine town warped in mind and spirit. As a writer of the macabre I adore the chilling suspense and the character interactions in this Stephen King classic. Both book and movie are well-worth the purchase. The movie has a fine cast, is well directed and the special effects are also excellent. And Tim Curry will chill your socks off with his bravura performance as the Killer Clown. But where does the monster come from? You'll have to watch the movie and wait and see! The Winds of Hell"
2,what's that movie again?,"The best thing about this movie is Tim Curry. The worst thing about this movie is everything else. No, that's not true, it's an innocuous movie that will leave you as you were - nothing added, nothing taken away. I only hate it (more like hate myself) because I bought a copy of the movie rather than rent it or borrow from a friend. Now, it's in my collection.As I can remember, it's about a group of kids who once drove away Pennywise, a small-town clown who kills other kids. All of them, except for one black guy, has since left the small town. When the killing resumes, the black guy tracks down all the other members of the group, so that they can play heroes once again.I must have passed out and when I came to, the movie is over. Even Tim Curry can't resurrect a dead concept."
4,"Good Price, No problems",The shipping was great. Came in early. It was a good price. me and my daughter had just read the book and it was kinda of a let down with the movie. not as scary as I remember it being. P.S. the second part of the movie is on the back side of the one DVD. I'm sorry to say It took us a little bit of time to figure that out!
1,Why do they even bother,"I loved It, the book that is. It kept me going. The plot, story, characters, everything was great. When i finished the book, I searched for the movie. When I found it, I eagerly sat down and watched it. By the end of part one, I was ready to cus at the TV screen. What the heck! It destroyed the book! The characters, the plot, the ending! They all sucked. I really feel that great novels shouldn't be wasted with cheap TV movies. I feel that most of King's works that are made into movies just don't give you the feel like the book. If you want to enjoy It to its full potential, read the novel. Don't watch the movie"
2,Terrible,"Although the book was the best I've ever read, and Stephen King did a stupendous job in both his character descriptions and plot, the movie was terrible. Not only has the movie eliminated important parts of the overall story, the acting outside of that done by Tim Curry is extremely poor. For example, the scene where Bill rushes off to get Eddie's inhaler as he fears that he might die, yet when he returns he is breathing comfortably. After this movie, Stephen King should no longer let his books be turned into movies."
1,Actually negative 10 stars,"Did we all see the same movie?!?!?! Well maybe because I am 25 years old that I can see the difference in real horror and a rushed film. This junk was rushed. Maybe if saw the movie first and then read the book, it would have been better. But the book was just the best. I can't believe that they even disgrace MY book with that mess. Sometimes if you read a book and then see the movie you can appreciate the movie a little for it's differences- not here. I read the book and the next night after I finished it I rented the video- couldn't even get through the entire thing. It Sucked so bad I wanted to cry. PLEASE, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE- PLEASE READ THE BOOK- I BEG OF YOU. Poor Billy and his friends. Well at lease the movie gave Stuttering Bill hair even though his stuttering was ridiculous. I know people who stutter and none of them are THAT bad. I could hear him in the book, but in the movie the few times when he stuttered, he looked like he needed Eds asthma medicine!!!!"
4,YOU'LL LOSE YOUR LITTLE MIND IN MY.... DEAD....LIGHTS,"LIKE ALL THE OTHERS....LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.... For anybody who is afraid of clowns, they should never see this movie. IT is Pennywise The Dancing Clown who eats worlds and children. The only thing that sucks is that the killings are never actually shown. The only ones brave enough to confront it are 7 kids who have hard relationships with each other after their childhood. When memories come back to them...they remember.....THERE'S SOME SAD NEWS. {I like Pennywise's razor-sharp teeth} The ending is a little disappointing, but the rest of the 3 hours is neat."
4,Killer Clown That Is A Giant Spider,Who knew at the end it was a Spider. I thought it was kool as the clown. This movie used to terrify me when i was young. But now when i watch it all i can do is laugh. Get realistic here a killing clown.Reallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
2,"The only thing scary here, is that you wanna see this movie","It is an evil clown. (Well not really, but thats a secret) It kills children. It is a pretty decent book. It is an underbudgeted, made for tv, dumb as all hell movie. All the scary parts of the book have been dumbed down to enable a 1990's tv audience to watch this dreck. The special effects are terrible and cheesy. like sumthing from 1942. The first half of this movie is ok but many things the kids do makes no sense, because the explanation of their actions was left out of the movie. The second half when they are adults drags on, and is plagued by badly puppeteered spiders. HOWEVER, Tim Curry is great as Pennywise the clown, or it. He fits the part perfectly and its almost worht watching this thing just to see him. However overall this movie suffers from what all of sevne kings tv movies are plagued with, bad book to screen scripts and mediocre cinematography. Read the book instead"
2,Ehhhhh...I could have lived with out seeing this,"Well, I woudn't say this movie as a whole (...), but the dialogue is pretty weak, a lot of it doesn't make any sense and the acting is hoooooorrrriiibbbbllllle. I mean it basically ruins the whole thing. The charahcters are just plain not believable. The best thig that can be said about it is that the pennywise segments are very scarry. But thats about it."
2,It.....wasn't that good.,From a Stephen King fan this was terrible. The first half is okay but the second half is just plain stupid! If you want to see a really good made-for-tv Stephen King movie see the Stand and Storm of the century.Not rated but contains scary scenes.
4,Stephen King's It DVD,I bought this item .Because I saw the movie via DVD rental .From my local Blockbuster video rental store.The story I thought is very good.unlike most horror movie's /which I'm a big fan of the genra.This movie has a very good story to it.Eventhough the DVD rental was quite watchable I had a little troube with it skipping and freezing up/but it was still good enough fore me to descover a classic.So I could not find the movie in my area.So I looked online and found it on Amazon.So I bought it online .The DVD is in much better condition then the copy that I rented.I had no trouble at all with it and was delighted that the movie s also widesscreen.A aspect raio that I much prefer over Full screen.Anyone who is thinking of buying this DVD can't go wrong with Amazon .com.I'm very satisfied with my purcase from Amazon.Paula Bettencourt
4,I hate steven King novels....,"I actually dont enjoy reading King's novels and have watched many of his movies, without appreciating them, so when this movie came out I figured what another waste of tape. Sure there was bigname actors in it, but so what???This one surprised me!! It scared me, it thrilled me, the story of the interaction between the kids and the adults was absolute genius.The acting was superb, and believable. A great thrilling movie!!!"
1,BORING!,"Gosh, this movie was sooooooo long! What was it? Like, 6 hours long? Jeez. Anyway, IT is the stupidest horror film I've ever seen. The acting is EXTREMELY shallow and the actors/actresses are only playing it by the numbers (i.e. reading off cue cards). There was little to no emotion in the film, and the last half-hour of the film was absolutely pathetic. It is obvious that time had run out so they just said ""okay, here, um, we'll film this and that and...OK, we're done!"" But really, this film spends WAY too much time building up the ""suspense"" so when we finally reach the end, it's a massive disappointment. I bet you'll NEVER guess what IT is. Believe me, you'll laugh when you find out. So I don't recommend this film at all, it's simply too long to sit through and if you do manage to sit through, say, 2 hours of it you'll be dead asleep by the third."
3,"It's Okay, But Doesn't Compare to the Book","Now, I didn't find this movie scary at all. None. But, that didn't bother me. It's just that the ending was so corny with the cheesy special effects. Also, the movie story was so different from the book that it was almost a completely new story. The only thing I enjoyed about it was Tim Curry's superb acting as Pennywise.So, it's okay, but it's most likely one of those movies I'm only seeing once, just to say I've seen it. Stephen KIng's IT, in my opinion, wouldn't hurt with a remake."
2,VERY STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this movie would scare me! I expect to be scared when it's a freakin horror movie!!!!!! That makes me so mad! I mean you barely got to see IT! Like maybe five times and that's it! That's not a lot for a movie that's 3 hours and seven minutes long!! A total dissapointment.
4,GREAT HORROR MOVIE!! WHICH GREATLY MOVES FAST!!,"This is a film. That can be watched several times by anyone reccomended by adults and teens according to the age difference. IT may be one of stephen king best selling novel even thou ive watched it when i was 6.From the king of terror, a chilling new dimension in horror. its a about a dimonic creature named IT THE PENNYWIS DANCING CLOWN Who is played by the marvelous Tim Curry. IT exists in shadows everywhere. IT knows their deepest fears, gaining strenth from their hate and frustration, now several school freinds include Annette O Toole Who plays Beverly Marsh Must return home to face IT....An unspeakable shpe-shifting creature feeding on the shocking evil lurking within them.For when they least expect IT....IT klls wthout mercy.Also staring Harry Anderson, Dennis Cristopher, Richard Massur, Tim Reid, Jhon Ritter And Richard Thomas."
3,Starts out in great style but doesn't stay the distance,"The first 90 mins. of this miniseries is really good, and builds up a lot of promise for things to come. But, as we see all too often, delivery is far more difficult than promise. The final confrontation had better been left out if this was the best execution they could come up with; a distinct ""C""-movie feeling is what you are left with at the end. And maybe that's exactly what this series is. Nevertheless I found Pennywise to be one of the scariest characters on TV and some scenes (especially in the first two thirds) are very well done - they would get 5 stars in this genre."
5,You'll die if you try!,"A brilliant horror film that scared me when I first saw it. Pennywise (Tim Curry) is one mean guy as a ghostly clown. I recommend this to horror fans, and it should be in your horror collection if it isn't now."
4,Long Waited Disc that should of been better as a movie,"This TV mini series was a frightener when released during the 90's. Tim Curry did an excellent job as Pennywise the clown just as he did in his cult classic ""LEGEND"". Whats good about this DVD is you get a better look at the movie thanks to the quality of the DVD and the special commentary track added to the film's special features that are inserted in this disc. The color and resolution is much better and the widescreen helps out a lot. I strongly recommmend you buy this disc to add it to your horror DVD collection. If you own the video your missing out on the next bestb thing."
3,"Boring Story, Good Terrror","If You Like Weird Reviews, Read This. This Movie Is Boring. It Has Some Good Terror, But Not Scary. Kida Weird And Stupid. I Don't Really Like It. I've Never Read The Book But, I Heard That The Movie Was Boring So I Checked It Out At My Friend Chris's House. It Was Boring. Sittin' There Watchin' A 192 Minuet Movie Being Bored. So Please Stephen King Fans, Do Not Say This Movie Was Good. PLEASE! The Best Terror Part Was The End (Not Really). Part Two Was Pretty Good. I Give Part One Of ""Stephen King's 'It'"" One Star. Part Two Of ""Stephen King's 'IT'"" Two Stars. Please Don't See This Movie, It Is Very Boring. (I Rate Part 1 PG-13. I Rate Part 2 PG-13. Please Be Bored After Watching This Movie.)"
3,Good but not Great,"The quality of the DVD is great and all, but it's all on a two-sided DVD, so there's no lable, and I can't tell which side I'm trying to play. The features aren't that great: the Cast List only lists the Adults, and doesn't give any information on them other than their names and the character they played. All-in-all, it's better than the recording off the TV I made on an old VHS..."
1,Make sure you get the right airbrush!,"One star rating because the kit contained the wrong airbrush:I was excited to try out this airbush (Badger 200-20 Detail) as I'd read some great reviews on it and Badger has a great reputation. Unfortunately when the airbrush kit arrived today, it had the wrong airbrush in it. As you can see from the picture, it has the Vega Nailaire airbrush instead of the 200 Detail. This is obviously incorrect as some of the parts included in the kit won't work with this airbrush. I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful however this product is out of stock so I was unable to get a replacement. I ordered a different 200 Detail kit (from Amazon) and they were good enough to expedite the shipping so hopefully I'll have a more positive review tomorrow."
2,Okay - but not brilliant,"I'm surprised to see so many glowing reviews of this book because I thought it was pretty bad. Okay, it's readable and moderately exciting, but the plot is crazy, and the characters are so lifeless they might as well be made out of cardboard. It's a shame, because Monkeewrench (which was called Want to Play? in the UK) was fantastic, even if the solution was completely unbelievable. The sequel was okay but nothing special. If people give this five stars, how do they rank the latest Michael Connelly, or John Sandford, or Jodi Compton? They're all so infinitely superior to this."
2,not a great sellection of music,"It's got the basics, but if you want a good selection of French music I've discovered that you have to buy it by composer. If you bought a book of Faure then you would have half of this book anyway."
1,Returned it for refund,"After installing the two AAA batteries, I found that it would not grind the pepper that was included. It quit as soon as it started. Didn't make any noise, as though something might be caught in a mechanism, but just quit. The size, smaller than other products, was attractive, but the performance was nonexistent."
5,A gem of a pepper mill,If you don't have one of these ... you should! Our old one broke and we were thrilled to find a replacement.
4,Great for prepared food but slow for cooking,Perfect pepper mill for the table. When cooking in large amounts it takes a while to get enough pepper for a large amount of food. I like a lot of pepper so this could be case by case.
2,new version *fail*,"The original product lasted at least 6 years.September 2011 bought new one from Amazon....seems motor or button faulty.CALL TRUDEAU 800#!!Trudeau sent replacement in March.Now it's April 2012.Again poor motor or button..Called Trudeau 800#!!They are sending a different pepper millSo.good customer service, something sub standard about new version of what used to be a good product."
5,Many blessings in a convenient little package!,"I love this little book. On the outside, it's well made, sturdy, extended flaps on either side to use as bookmarkers....but that must be because they knew it would get a lot of use!Inside each page is devoted to a specific blessing, at the top of the page there is a quote relevant to the topic, the blessing and then a brief essay/prayer. Each one is lovely.Here are some examples of the topics: ""The Seasons of my Heart have Purpose and Meaning"", ""This Earth is Radiant with Grace"", ""My Strength is a Fortress"". But the words that follow are the real gems. Ms. Cameron writes with sensitivity and grace, in a way that seems to speak to the heart, no matter what your religous belief. I've found this book very valuable in my morning devotions."
4,Savatage - 'Ghost In The Ruins - A Tribute To Criss Oliva' (Nuclear Blast),"Well assembled thirteen track live CD from the band's touring heyday, 1987-90. I should know 'cause I saw them play on several occasions during that time frame. Recorded in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and a few other cities. Tracks that make this disc a keeper are the total *ss-kicking ""24 Hours Ago"", ""Legions"" {featuring some ripping guitar}, ""Of Rage And War"", one of my personal Savatage favorites - the awesome ""The Dungeons Are Calling"" and the old Headbanger's Ball classic ""Hall Of The Mountain King"". 'Ghost' features the original line-up: Jon Oliva-vocals, Criss Oliva & Chris Cafferty-guitars, Johnny Lee Middleton-bass and Steve Wacholz-drums. Definitely recommended."
4,Good Book to Stimulate Ideas,"This book has a lot of really good ideas for small areas, including nooks and crannies. I was amazed at how you can decorate some really small areas, even though I don't have any nooks as small as some of them. It is a beautifully photographed book and doesn't seem to be afraid to use colors. I would say there are a variety of styles represented in the book, but it tends to lean more to the traditional with an occ. formal country look (florals, stripes, etc).When I read a decor book I put tabs on pages that either gave me ideas or when I liked the rooms. Even though the book has good ideas, I only placed tabs on 8 pages.I do think it is worth the price and I don't regret buying it. It had some innovative and great designs for small spaces."
1,awful,Hated it. Could not believe I was forced to endure this text for an entire course. Totally insulting and biased.
2,silly string the dominant and the oppressed,Well looks like I'm the man. This book sucks. But you'll have to read it for a class. If somebody's gotta read it might as well be you.
5,Aaron Neville's BEST!,"This was my second copy of Aaron Neville's Warm Your Heart CD--I wore the first one out!! Yes, I listened to it that much--it is that good!!"
1,Low budget waste,"I usually will go for most travel videos, but this was not worth the price. I teach a class on Russian literature and culture and sadly found little value in this video. I do like when they show a meal with some locals near Lake Baikal, but there is not much too it other than that. This is not worth it."
5,Something about people eating bugs,"Along with Fear Factor, this is cool because I'm fascinated with watching people eat bugs. Call me weird, I don't care. The fact that this is also educational and my husband likes it makes it even better. I love how we spend all weekend watching the episodes."
1,Junk,The Reel is JUNK!! If it was not such a hassle I would send it back. Reel did not work out of the Box!!skippy
5,The Last American Hero,"The movie was entertaining but not great. If you like old time racing and the beginnings of today's NASCAR, you will probably like this movie. If your not a race fan, forget it.Good transaction!"
4,A different type of erotic experience,"Thongs is not a typical piece of erotica, if one even exists. :) It tells the story of a young Irish girl, growing up in the dirty streets and despised by her parents. An underlying mystical aura about her, you begin to understand that she is ""bound"" for something very special and unusual where sexuality is concerned. The story does a great job of humanizing the heroine through her many degrading acts, running a gamut of sexual possibilities without surrendering her most prized virginity to the men she encounters. An arousing and well written piece of erotica that might just make you cry as well. As an erotic writer myself, I found it an inspiring read.-Mistress Twilight Blue"
1,Efficient minded backpacking,"I'm not sure why anyone wants to apply efficient based principles to something as simple as backpacking. Sure, if you wanna race against mother nature to get from mexico to canada in 4 months, but I don't think anyone has ever fully enjoyed the experience cruising along the PCT 20+ miles a day continuously. However, I do like the idea of making my own gear, but his extreme behavior and belief system really puzzles me. While reading I asked myself; Does he want people to believe he's some revolutionary founder of lightweight backpacking? I guess that would explain his gloating of his small following called ""Jardinites"" (he proudly exclaims in the book), that believe his practices and beliefs are on par with Charles Darwin and other great influencial minds of our past. I say, ""wake up you simpletons"" it's all common sense! Nevertheless, if you're in need to become a follower or just looking for some paper to burn in the fireplace, look no further!"
4,it's the point of view that counts,"Everyone seems to be either complaining of Jardine's rather evangelical tone, or touting his methods. To me, both criticisms seem to have missed the point. To me, the great value of Jardine's book(s), his website, and other writings is thus:1. you can build it, sew it, or make it yourself. you don't have to buy it from the outdoor industry, if you don't want to.2. comfort and enjoyment are possible (and sometimes alot more probable) without alot of the stuff that we think are necessities.3. less weight doesn't mean that you have to go faster, but that you can go faster when necessary or desirable. it's not speed, but efficiency that matters.4. and, most importantly: YOU can figure out the best way to do things, even if they don't make sense to anyone else."
3,Provocative Approach,"Ray Jardine presents his eccentric, provocative approach to backpacking. I would not recommend this approach to a beginner, but only an experienced backpacker. Some of his ideas go beyond eccentric to nutty--he speaks approvingly of walking barefoot, for example, or of eliminating the very innovations that have done the most to improve backpacking--sleeping pads, stoves, hip belts. And his numbers never quite add up--by his own admission, his ""eight and a half pound pack"" can weigh up to fifty pounds. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading for the challenge he presents, and also for some of his advice on particular issues (handling ice and snow for example). One reviewer called this book the ""most comprehensive,"" but I would certainly see it as less so than Complete Walker IV, which I would recommend to everyone."
4,More of the Same,"A Good book if you haven't already got ""The Pacific Crest Trail"" by Ray Jardine.Much of the same information is in ""Beyond Backpacking"" as was in ""The Pacific Crest Trail"". This shows me Ray Jardine gave out all his information in his first book so now he really has nothing more to tell. You might as well have put one cover on the other with the exception of a very few changes. In fairness though, it is a great book if you don't have ""The Pacific Crest Trail"". But I don't think you need them both. It is all the same ultra-light backpacking techniques, and backpacking safety,equipment,and hiking methods in both books. I liked the ""Pacific Crest Trail"" better."
3,Paul Simon : Complete,I ordered this book and find out that it is the volume two. Obviously I only got the second half of Paul's songs. I don't understand why they didn't indicate that on the site. I guess probably no one knows anyway. The gentleman that wrote the previous comment didn't mention that as well... what went wrong?? Now I have no idea how to get the first half of the book set... Can someone help??
5,Incredible Noah's Ark footage,"This documentation of the discovery of Noah's Ark is absolutely diffinitive. It is the most remarkable coverage and video footage to show what has been found atop Mount Ararat. I would recommend this video to anyone who questions the truth of the Bible or existence of Noah, the Ark, and the Flood. Very spine tingling."
2,Real Bozo the clown science,This is made by the same duo (Sellier and Balsiger) wrote the junky misinformative In Search of Noah's Ark book and film in the 70's. This film itself briefly presents skeptics of an idiotic totally worldwide flood briefly then sneakily dwells on highly paid quack scientists who present bogus evidence of a world wide flood. This probably leaves the untrained viewer with the wrong impression of strong evidence of a worldwide flood. See books at your library by Prof. Lloyd Bailey on just how misinformative this duo can be.
2,Blah,This movie had all the right actors but it was still not good. It was missing elements. It wasn't compelling and the ending was blah.
5,Best of the Best,CD covers all the best hits.Strong vocal & great quality for the money spent.You can pick & choose your own.
5,Fantastic Addition to ATL,"The ATL Server library is the perfect addition to ATL, adding the ability to create web services and web applications with the light-weight model of ATL. I found this book very useful for getting new members of my development team up to speed on the basics of ATL Server development (both those with previous ISAPI experience and those without).I also found this book very useful when tackling some of the more difficult problems that our application faced. In particular the Advanced sections on SRF files, Request Handlers and Web Services provided a number of useful techniques that we were able to apply in our application.The book also outlines some techniques for using parts of the ATL Server library in non-web applications, which we are finding very useful as we update some of our existing code."
5,excellent drama & mystery.,These are well constructed episodes; we are a small library and Inspector Lewis is quite popular with the patrons. We all can recommend this series.
5,Inspector Lewis just keeps getting better.,"Carrying on the tradition of ""Inspector Morse"", the excellent writers of ""Inspector Lewis"" are delivering interesting plot lines along with gentle character development for Lewis, Hathaway and Dr. Hobson. The direction and photography are top-notch, too.Since Season 4 on Amazon Prime differs from the list of episodes found on other websites, I am listing them here:1 ""Old, Unhappy, Far Off Things""A reunion at an all-female college ends in a murder.2 ""Wild Justice""A bishop visiting St Gerard's College dies after drinking poisoned wine.3 ""The Mind Has Mountains""A student dies during a residential clinical trial for a new anti-depressant.4 ""The Gift of Promise""The memoirs of a former MI5 agent reveal clues to help Lewis solve the murder of a businesswoman."
3,mixed reviews,"I purchased this planner based on the glowing reviews on this website. It did have some good questions to keep in mind and some very good organizational materials, but I also felt like 1-800-WEDDINGS were hyping themselves too much. (I work in advertising and still found it offensive). I was also upset that the ""honeymoon"" section had only two tabs-""Sandals"" and ""Hawaii"". As if these are the only two places anyone would consider honeymooning. It just made me wonder how much Sandles was paying them to promote their resort. In the end, I took some pages from this planner and put together a better one for myself (the pockets did come in handy!). It was helpful, but it may not be everythng you need."
2,"Badly Written, Repetitive and Inconsistent","...other than that, it's a great bargain.The research into the lives of each mobster is shallow and secondary at best. The writing is British style book which, considering the subject matter, seems contradictory. Finally, you read a chapter purporting to be biographical and finish realizing that you don't really have a sense of the person at all.If you've never read anything about historical American organized crime figures, and plan never to read anything about them again, this might be just the book for you. After finishing it, you'll have little to no desire to do so."
5,Sorbie,I have been a Sorbie customer for years. The shampoo Cleane for chemically treated hair is wonderful. The conditioner is the best I have ever used. Now I am using cleane-forme energizing shampoo and I am very pleased. I remain a Sorbie customer and now I can have it delivered to my home.
4,Fascinating,I was fascinated by this book. It's perfect for anyone who loves historical non-fiction. I had never heard of it before I purchased it on the Kindle Daily Deal awhile back and I'm glad I did.
4,Black Like Me,"""Black Like Me"" by John Howard Griffin is truly a magnificent book. All his life, he has seen the ridicule and hate towards African - Americans, but no he decides to journey into the life of a black man. With his skin tempoaririly darkened due to medical treatements, he says goodbye to his family and journeys into the life of an African American in the deep South. This book truly touched me. Me, being a young black woman, have exerienced minor events such as recorded in this book, but nothing ever this major. This is a book that all people need to read, wether you be white, black, chinese, asian.... ANYTHING!!! This book may only seem to focus on the love / hate relationship between whites and blacks, but really it reaches out to all types of racism.... girl / boy, chinese / japenese.... evendog / cat! This is definitely as must - read, page - turnin, ""gimme just five more minutes, mom"" type of book. I definietly give it two thumbs up!"
1,"Good theory, poor execution","The literature on the manufacturer's website (Spark Technology) implies that the CellStik can be updated to be compatible with new models by simply downloading software to ""upgrade"" the ""stick"". I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband for Christmas. He has the Samsung A820 model and, as I write this, we have not been able to get updated software to make this compatible with my husband's cellular phone. So, this is a good theory--upgrade your phone and easily transfer information--but it is NOT a good product. I am truly disappointed."
2,Banality posing as creativity,"Broderick tries to be original with his idea of idea of godlike beings stuck in weird dimensions, but his writing comes across as forced and his characters are overall not very interesting. Read Roger Zelazny's Amber series if you want to see the same idea done by a better writer (although with fantasy and not science fiction aspects)."
4,"Brilliant for some, possibly annoying for others","You Either Love 'em or Hate 'em. I love 'em. I think that anyone who listens carefully and with an open mind will find incredible range and expression in the music and especially the vocals. Although not what I had hoped entirely, the cover of Tracy Chapman's 'Fast Car' is quite dynamic and sometimes stunning.These are songs of pain and emotional torture, as well as of love."
5,A wonderful insight on Capitalism,We should require our children to read this book. True success is about being an uplifter of others. You don't start a business and build it to be worth over $7 billion (debt free) and not know a thing or two about success. This book is a practical guide to make your life a successful one.
3,"Detailed info, much of it dated, more current books out ther","This author obviously knows what he's talking about, but the book is dated and too detailed on some topics and not enough detailed on other topics to really provide a good broad brush of the topic. There's lots on audio, but not enough on much of what is going on today, like Windows XP Media Center Edition and PVRs and DirecWAY and other things. This is a consumer electronics focus in an increasingly broader industry. I've put a lot more into my home theater than he's talked about. I'm buying Home Theater for Dummies to see what they say -- their outline is broader and their edition is just out."
3,Watch out for velcro!!!,"I purchased this because my 7 week old tilts his head and this does help him hold is head correctly. However, watch out of the velcro behind the baby's neck. I went to pick up my LO and the velcro was stuck in his hair. I have NEVER heard him scream so loud with pain having to pull the velcro from his hair. I felt so bad for him it made me tear up. The velcro also left a rash on the back of his neck from rubbing. If it wasnt for this happeneing I would have given the product 5 stars."
2,Nice...If it fit my car seat!,"If you have a Peg Perego SIP car seat don't waste your time buying this, because it does not fit with the car seat side- impact wings. If you don't believe me, google ""Snuzzler"" and ""Peg Perego"" and you will see someone else stating this, and they have posted photos. The reason I have given this 2 stars is because it fits in my Graco Sweetpeace swing and my baby likes it in there. It looks quite comfy. I just wish it fit like it should in the car seat!"
3,Great until used for awhile,"I loved this item when I was first using it. Then when my baby was 2 months old, I noticed the the detactable head piece was slipping and exposing the velcro strip which was scatching my baby's neck. I had notice it before and tried to lift the material back up where it belonged, but her just sitting in the seat, made it slip back down and contiued to scatch her neck. I've taken it out of her seat and replace it with a regular head rest. I did up to this point love this item, it kept her cuddled and secure in her carseat. But I am a little dissapointed in the detactable piece where the velcro is exposed."
5,"Excellent product, and I got it free!","You can get this product, along with any other baby products up to $500 Free! Participate in this special promotion and get a free $500 baby products gift card at this web site: http://xrl.us/babycard"
5,BEST BUY EVER,"THIS IS THE BEST THING MY HUSBAND HAS EVER PURCHASED. HE BOUGHT THE SNUZZLER WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS BORN. THE INFANT CARRIER SWALLOWED HER AND SHE LOOKED SO UNCOMFORTABLE. ONCE WE PUT HER IN THE CARRIER WITH THE SNUZZLER, SHE WAS ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP EASIER AND HER HEAD WOULDN'T FALL FORWARD. ONCE SHE OUTGREW IT, MY BEST FRIEND USED IT FOR HER SON (AND IT STILL KEPT ITS SHAPE). NOW MY 7 MONTH OLD IS USING IT. I'D RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO EVERYONE THAT WANTS THEIR BABY TO BE COMFORTABLE AND COZY."
2,Kind of a waste,"My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use. Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support."
4,Comfortable support,"We used this for our daughter in her stroller when she was still pretty tiny. We never needed it for the car seat, though. I found this to be very supportive of her little head. We were able to use a smaller stroller with this, instead of a large infant stroller, which I did not want to haul around. This is easy to clean, and very soft as well. Great for supporting little ones."
1,big no-no,"I am a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician. Aftermarket products like this should never be used in a car seat, only accessories that came WITH the car seat. The padding can compress in an accident, and the baby can be ejected from the car seat. Using aftermarket products will also void the warranty of a car seat. If you want the nice inserts/supports/etc, buy a car seat that comes with them."
1,"Poor recital by inept, overrated soprano","Callas is awful on this CD. She cannot sing Lakmé's difficult florid music without embarrassing herself. As for the verismo arias, she really doesn't have the right voice for them. She really is bad here. (...)"
5,Beautiful,"I'm not one of those people who thinks that nothing Maria Callas sung has ever been performed better, but I know a good recording when I hear it. If anyone ever wanted proof that Callas was among the greatest sopranos of all time, this recording, made at the zenith of her career, is it. In particular, the lyric selections are impressive. Her ""Ebben? Ne andro lontana"" puts her ""rival"" Tebaldi to shame (why she was ever considered a rival is beyond me), and is the best performance on disc of this beautiful aria, despite cutting the ending off, which seems to be becoming a habit in recordings."
3,"Nice but mid-size (unisex), not mini (womens)","I bought it for my 15 years old niece. The product description says its dial has 26 mm diameter, but the whole crown actually has 33 mm diameter, so it's really a midsize watch. The decription is at least incomplete or wrong."
3,A very thorough and informative study.,"Polk is frequently ranked in the top third of US presidents. The years of his presidency fall between Jackson and Lincoln - a period where the presidents around him were generally considered among the worst in history. Polk clearly learned lessons about management and control from the failures of Tyler before him and these lessons led to a most effective presidency. While sectionalism begins to tear apart the preceding presidency and those that followed, the Polk presidency sees a chief executive who manages to be in charge of events during his 4 years. This book was a good read about an import man in a dangerous and exciting time and perhaps a lesson in not promising only to serve one term."
4,Great fit,Already had the rack for years so I measured and hoped it would fit and it did perfectly!! Love it!
4,"Finally a serviceable, no-wobble rack for garment storage!","The tall Whitmor rack was exactly what I was looking for: sturdy after assembly, and easy to assemble, with clear instructions for assembly, especially in the diagrams. One caution on this point: the 4 locking wheels should be screwed into the bottoms of the 4 uprights BEFORE (not after!) the bottom shelf is slid onto the uprights; after the shelf is added, the bottoms of the uprights are virtually inaccessible - unless there is a second person to help holding up the partially assembled rack. I managed it alone, just barely!"
2,Artificial Intelligences Exist Today,"Scientists have formulated at least 100 definitions of what intelligence is. (for a partial listing see www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/)Several computer programs exist which qualify as intelligent according to at least the vast majority of these definitions. (for instance my Asa, Trans. of the Kansas Acad. of Sci., vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006,www.bioone.org/archive/0022-8443/109/3/pdf/i0022-8443-109-3-159.pdf) Not all creatures are equally intelligent so there is no need for an AI to be as intelligent as the average human. In point of fact, however, AIs exist which outperform humans at a number of important tasks."
2,Silver John is better than this,"Mr. Wellman wrote this novel later in his life: his most famous character, Silver John, has been adventuring through the mystical mountains of North Carolina since the 1950's.While he is no older, as a character he does not seem to have improved with age.For me, Silver John has always been an entirely believable American mythic hero, similar to Paul Bunyan or Johnny Appleseed..Wellman had a wonderful ability to tell a complete and highly memorable story in about 300 words, butstretching a short story into a novel only made it feel stretched.I was somewhat disappointed based on the memorable quality of his earlier stories. Silver John felt like a reflection of himself, or a re-creation.Those interested in Wellman's best work would do better to read ""Who Fears the Devil?"" especially its wonderful inter-chapters.Nonetheless, I will continue to follow Silver John's trail of wonders in Wellman's other books."
1,watch out - no vista drivers,"After looking everywhere, I've come up empty on signed drivers compatible with windows vista. Beware!"
5,Must read,"The book could be described as ""dry"" on occasion but it's History, forgotten History at that. I loved Mr.Aleshire's book about a true Hero that so little has been written of. I enjoyed the chapter notes and appreciate that Mr. Aleshire added his own assumptions at time. I had a hard time putting this book down and have recommended it to people I know would enjoy it. My Great-Grandmother mentioned Lozen when I was younger and until I was in High School I thought she was a myth. What a terrible shame it is to know so little about someone so legend worthy."
5,Wonderful,I grew up listening to the Four Seasons. This cd confirmed how rich in wonderful music their legacy as musicians is. I truly enjoy this treasure of hits and I am so glad own it now.
5,Great set of songs!,A fantastic compilation of all the 4 Season's best hits and even some lesser known songs. A must have for anyone who has just seen Jersey Boys! Excellent sound quality with no distortion whatsoever.
3,Basic horse care manual,"This book covers the basics. It covers a variety of horse care subjects but only touches on those subjects. This would be a good book to start your knowledge of a variety of horse care subjects, although not enough for the horse owner."
2,"Book is good, CD is not","Everything about the book was fine, but the CD was glued to the seem of the book. The glue is not removable from the CD and so the CD is useless."
1,Disappointed with mower and Amazon,"Received the mower 4 days after ordering it. Made me very happy with the fast delivery. Mower was assembled as per instructions. When I tried to mow the lawn, the self-propel on the mower did not work. I contacted Amazon right away. The mower was sent back and received at Amazon. A replacement still has not been sent. Thankfully, I have a wonderful neighbor who is kind enough to let me use his lawn mower. STILL WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE MOWER. AMAZON KEEPS GIVING ONE EXCUSE AFTER ANOTHER. I order the mower in anticipation of using it in 2007. God only knows when and if another mower will ever be sent."
4,"Buy it for, Espresso Love!",This is a good album from Dire Straits. But not the best one...The best song is probably Espresso Love as best!! I'll give it 4 because Espresso Love is one of my favourite DS tunes ever.
5,Essential Dire Straits,"Once one gets past the collections and Brothers in Arms, and becomes interested in being a real fan, one comes to Making Movies.The bit from High Fidelity- Top Five Side One, Track Ones- how could he have missed Tunnel of Love? And just as one comes off the impact of that song, to get hit with Romeo and Juliet- this is what got me through High School.It is perhaps a less consistent album than Brothers in Arms. Some songs are a little sketchy, sound like maybe they should have done a few more takes. The second half is maybe a tiny bit below Dire Straits standards. But for the payoff of the high points, I'd pay ten times the selling price. Some of those songs I can listen to six times in a row."
3,Cute but insubstantial,This book could have done alot more. The stories (and some are cute) all seem to come from the same voice and most of the jobs were blue collar. I would have liked more white collar stories and more stories with some biting wit.
4,works,easy to set up and works well. Understand that it only has one drive. Can be deceiving with dub button
1,Disappointed!!,I was not impressed with this book. I was hoping to get some new and fresh ideas as to what to do with my 2 year old. Most of the ideas in this book were things most people think of on their own.
5,Best bel canto singing from Callas,"I am tried of people comparing Callas and Sutherland or Tebaldi. Why can't we appreciate all of them? All singers have their strength and weakness. Callas is at her best here in this album. She is very moving and her technique is superb. The Mad scence from Anna Bolena is just stunningly beautiful. The final cabaletta shows Callas at home in one of the most challenging arias in bel canto operas. Her trills and scales are beyond criticism. This is one of my favorite albums together with Sutherland's ""The Art of Prima Donna"" and Price's blue album."
3,review for a perfect stranger,This book came in good time. It could have been my mistake but I thought I was ordering a hardcover book. When I received the book it was a paperback so I had to buy the book again from another vendor.
2,big disappointment,"This is the first time I'm actually taking the time to write a user review for a CD purchased on Amazon. So why now? Because I feel people should be warned before shelling out their hard-earned cash for this album.This is some drum and bass with some heavy rap emphasis. I picked up this album because DJ Craze spun at a club in my area, and I thought it some amazing stuff that I heard. It seems that Craze does many different flavors of D&B;, and while repetitive soundclips is part of the idea behind this kind of music, it's the repetetive spoken clips that just get *annoying*. If you like that kinda stuff, then more power to ya, order this right now. For me, this was a real waste of money.You want good D&B;? Check out anything by Moving Shadow.(The only reason this CD received two stars instead of one is because the one star music rating is reserved explicitly for country.)"
4,Great stuff !!,I have dry skin and was looking for a reasonably inexpensive moisturizer/after shave lotion. I hate products that leave an oily film or have pungent aromas. This Nivea balm has neither. It easily absorbs into the skin after a few minutes leaving your face feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the packaging. A plastic bottle you could squeeze would be safer and more convenient than the glass bottle. (This should also make it cheaper to ship if you are ordering online given the corresponding reduction in weight.) This is the only drawback of this product.4 stars (would have given it 5 if not for the packaging).
1,Wish they discussed Chihuahua ADOPTION!!,"Wish the authors had discussed chihuahua ADOPTION!! Due to the fact that Chihuahuas are a ""fad"" breed these days, there are lots and lots of wonderful Chis available for adoption at shelters and rescues across the country.The authors also need to advise readers about the dangers of ""puppymill"" puppies.It would have been nice to see references to great groups like Chihuahuarescue.com that are so helpful in placing dogs and educating chihuahua owners about care of these little dogs.There also should be info about protecting chihuahuas from attacks from big dogs, a dangerous possibility with these small dogs.Many topics left uncovered!"
5,"Thomson's take on ""Big Sleep"" a convincing love-letter","David Thomson is arguably the most gifted writer on the cinema -- his ""Biogrpahical Dictionary of Film"" one of the subject's most valued reference guides. Singling out Howard Hawks' film version of Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"" as the most entertaining movie ever made is clearly a bold move on Thomson's part, but his arguments are steadfast and persuasive. Anyone choosing to read this work will emerge with a deeper understanding of the great detective film and an irresistable desire to see it again as soon as possible."
4,nice read even for guys named Rick,the book is a joy to read. it is refeshing and inspirational at many levels. however there is a weird differentiation between 'out' and 'outdoors' that this reader doesn't agree with. To me it is more hurtful to drive someone 'out' and to be outdoors could be bearable. just a thought sus.
4,A very powerful and life changing novel.,"The way Toni Morrison writes THE BLUEST EYE,is very powerfuland touching. I like that in a book. It was very hard for me tobelieve children were treated in a way that they were afraid to live. You really get to see and feel how the pain Pecola, her friends, and family had to go through affected their lives. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read very powerful real life stories."
5,Great literature.,"Pecola Breedlove has only one desire in her life: to possess the blue eyes which were considered beautiful by society. This novel basically focuses on her life and that of her friends, who constantly encounter many hardships in their young lives. A novel of heartbreak, betrayal and a struggle to survive. Toni Morrison is one of the greatest American novelists."
1,Disappointing,I didn't like this book at all. I found it difficult to read because of the way some of the characters spoke. The author writes in many different points of view and I could never figure out who was talking at that point. I don't think that this book deserves half the praise it received.
2,confused,"This book was very confusing to me. I didn't like how the author jumped arouind from person to person, it made the book very hard to follow. Like others have said also, many areas in this book are quite disturbing. Some of the stuff quite frankly just didn't need to be in the book. I understand that the author wanted to be discriptive and let us know what was going on, but i feel that in parts it was too descriptive. All in all i don't think that many would be able to understand the context of this book. It just goes too deep. but if you like description and can be mature about somewhat disturbing passages, you might enjoy this book."
3,Tragic,This book is well written but a little too tragic for me. I have read many of the books on Oprah's Bk Club but my only complaint is that many of the books she chooses are tragedies. I like a book that I can really get lost in and escape to another place or time. This book kept me interested but it is not one of the better books I have read.
5,Excellent!!,"The product was exactly as described, and it arrived in a timely fation. Thanks it saved me from having to buy a brand new hard copy. It's also a great read!!"
1,A Sick Novel,"Any review you read about The Bluest Eye will tell you that it is a book about a little 11 year old girl who wishes to have blue eyes and blonde hair. However, the entire plot of the novel revolves around the human desire for sex. The book disgusted me with its extensive descriptions of child molesting and prostitutes. I would have thrown the book away if I didn't have to read it for my honors English class. It blows my mind how this book is in many book clubs and how the author won a Nobel award. The entire book is sick, and if I didn't know better, I would say that its main audience purchases it at adult book stores."
4,Beauty,"The description Toni Morrison uses throughout this novel makes it an enjoyable read. I found some minor difficulty in identifying the order of events, particularly because it skipped around a lot. As the book went along, it became easier to piece the puzzle. The lengths one goes to for beauty can destroy you. This was true for Pecolia. She strove to be beautiful and have blue eyes but when she finally achieved this, she went insane. This problem of desiring to be beautiful still exists in today's society. Anorexia and Bulimia are major forms of destruction that affect young teenagers. After completing this novel, I feel that I have gained a better understanding as to what beauty truly is."
3,An Interesting Book,I found this book very interesting but at times confusing .Soaphead Church made it that way. He could have been left out. As far as the other characters they were true to the story . One must go beyond the language and abuse Pecola endured as these are things people experience. It is reality .I felt as if I could see her and understand this child. For those that never had to live the way these characters had to they will not understand where Toni Morrison is coming from. I found this a book that really touches the heart.
3,Continuous hope for blue eyes,"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison is a novel that was written in 1965-69.The scene is set in Lorain, Ohio, in the early 1940's. Pecola Breedlove is an 11 year old black girl whose deepest love is for blue eye's. Growing up her whole childhood life Pecola was known as an ugly child.Children on the playground would make fun of her, calling her names and pointing finger's at her.Pecola prays for her eyes to turn blue so that she will be beautiful, people would look at her in a different , and her whole world would be better.Pecloa's hope, love, and inner beauty gives her hope that one day God would bless her with blue eyes. Personally this novel was not my type of reading.It put me to sleep in a matter of minutes. I recomend this book to anyone who believes in equality for everyone."
3,Not Bad But Not Good Either,"Morrison is an excellent writer, by far one of the best. However, I was disappointed by this book for different reasons perhaps than others have found this book to their dislike. I was nauseated by the portrayal of black men in this novel! Black men in the Bluest Eye are irresponsible, sex-crazed, child molesting, drunks and this is just in the first couple of chapters. Though a case could be argued that black men are not portrayed in a REALISTIC light in any medium,I must say that I kind of expected more from this exceptional writer!"
4,A Beautiful Book,"I first read this book a few years ago and was surprised by thepower and beauty in Morrison's words. After reading the book again, Iam again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for ""the bluest eyes"" as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."
4,A Relection of life,"I read The Bluest Eye, in high school. The perfect place to read a book like this, where everyone is so caught up in the outward appearance. It's a sad tale of a young girl, named Pecola growing up in a bad neighborhood with careless parents. All Pecola wants in life is to be loved and in the society she lives in having blue eyes was concidered beautiful, so every day she wishes for blue eyes. This is a heart wrenching tale of young Pecola and the extent of her desperation to be loved in a world that conciders her ""ugly"". I recommend this book for all mature readers, for there is content not appropriate for younger readers."
1,upsetting homophobia,"This book was ruined for me by it's intense homophobia. If you are gay, you will resent the hateful way you are portrayed in The Bluest Eye."
1,Worst of all the Oprah selections,"I've read most of the Oprah book club selections and found this one to be the most dragged out and rather boring one of the bunch. I kept at it, hoping it would get more interesting but, alas, it was boring to the end. There was only one other of Oprah's choices that I really didn't care for (can't recall now which one...guess it really WAS forgetable). A difinate 'thumbs down' from me."
1,Too horrible to read,"Of all the books in the world this is my least favorite. Notice that I didn't say it was the worst; I said it was my least favorite. The difference is that I don't think it's a poorly written book, although I also don't think it's as brilliant as some people seem to think. The writing is very poetic, and if you like modern ""literary"" literature, you will almost certainly like this book. If you like to cut to the very soul of some deeply twisted characters, then this is the book for you.However, if, like me, you would prefer not to read poignantly vivid descriptions of incestuous rape, don't pick up this book. If you have any limits as to what degree of perversity you are willing to read in a book, this one definately crosses them. I'm not necessarily saying it's gratuitous, but it's still disgusting.If you want to read a Toni Morrison book without so much crude sexual imagery try Song of Solomon (mind you, there's still plenty in that, too, it's just not as graphic)."
1,No character development,"Sadly this could have been a very good book had she made us CARE about any of the people in it. As it is, you didn't really care what happened to anyone. It was disjointed and lacking in any type of motivation.I am not asking for happy endings, but by the time this book was over I couldn't even bring myself to remember the character's names. Very bleak with no redeeming qualities to any of the characters."
4,"Not great, a bit predictable","I knew the minute Patrick Leslie showed up just how the book was going to end. but i'll not say anything. But it was a fun ride, and while this book was not the best, it wasn't the worst either. I wish the time in San Lorenzo had lasted longer, i would have liked to have seen a whole book placed there.Rosamund matured a bit in this book. while at times she still annoyed me, it wasn't too bad."
3,Average....,"I read Rosamund and I quite enjoyed it. So, I was very excited to read this one. When I did read I was a bit disappointed. I found myself disliking Rosamund in this book whereas I liked her in the first novel. First of all, I found the first scene with Patrick and her unbelievable. Secondly, I found her behavior rather rash in comparison to the first book. I just found her too bold. Not that there's anything wrong with that it's just not the way I imagined her to be after the first book. Then she took up and left her three daughters for months so she could cohabitate with Patrick in the warm weather. I guess that was accepted in those days but I don't agree with it. In a way Rosamund was selfish. Also, the ending was quite predictable as to who she would be with. Nothing new here!"
3,Roof is on fire 5x,"The song on here was pretty good, the problem though is basically there are 3 diff mixes on here, a clean version & Explicit version, they could have made 2 diff cds but i guess they were being cheap, im also looking for 1 other song by T.K.C. which is ""The Rebel"", i can't find it anywhere other then Bad Boy Bill's ""Bangin' The Box Vol 1"", it would have been cool if they added that song on this single."
4,Experimental dark metal,"I have to admit that it took a couple listens for me to get use to Rebel Extraganza. This album is far different from any of Satyricon's previous releases. The conceptual themes of past albums ""Shadowthrone"", and ""Dark Medeval Times"" are no longer present. Rebel is much more stripped down while maintaining a dynamic sound that sets Saytricon apart from it's Black Metal contemporaries. My favorite songs would have to be ""Havok Vultures""( w/ a cameo from Ferniz or DarkThrone), ""Prime Evil Renaissance"", and the blast beat rythms of ""Supersonic Journey"". Rebel also includes a couple of subtle interludes in between songs, allowing you to rest before your senses get pummeled again with Satyricon's brand of Dark Metal. Most fans either hate or love this album. This albums an aquired taste.I myself listen to it with a sense of awe, as one may listen to symphony or orchestra music. Does it rock? Hell yeah! A must have for open minded metal fanatics."
1,Don't bother with this one,"I've tried everything to make this air purifier work. It won't stay on! If you want to waste your money on another China-made product that is junk, then buy this one. You'll regret it."
4,"A tough ending, but recommended read","A well written novel. It is engaging. It is not fast paced, but it also does not plod. As a previous reviewer stated, if you are looking for someone to cheer for, this is not the book. Initially, the ending of the novel was frustrating too me. However, as I have thought since about the book, I have been fascinated by the open-endedness and the ambiguity. Sometimes life doesn't have heroes. Sometimes individuals feel like they are forced to choose one side or another, with both sides being unsatisfying. This book captures this dilemma."
3,This unit requires 3 wire circuit,"This unit requires a 3 wire circuit. I thought this switch was equivalent to the Lutron MA-LFQHW-WH but using slides rather than the other unit's buttons, but it's not. I'm now hoping the inclusion of a canopy module with the MA-LFQHW-WH (which I'm now ordering) allows it to work with a 2 wire circuit. That description explicitly says it works with most circuits while this units description wasn't explicit about what was required."
5,It lived up to my expectations,The book is comprehensive and very practical. I will be able to use it in the different roles that I play in different spheres of my life.
4,Must have resource if you do training,"If you do workshops or seminars (bigger workshops) this book is FILLED with step by step excercises, drills and activities to reinforce the subject while forcing effective interaction. You simply just must have it to use when building your day out. REALLY REALLY helpful!JGVwww.johngvincent.com"
4,John Lee Hooker CD,"I was hesitant to order but when I received the CD, I really enjoyed hearing John Lee Hooker's music; brought back memories!!"
4,Enjoy earing and living the good News.,"I am a portuguese and I do not use the English as a spoken language. I listened to the almost all the 12 cassetes and I found it very comprehensible and easy, because of the vivid style and a smart background sound that put the life of Jesus in the correct ambient (place). The word of God takes the first place. There are 12 cassettes of about 90 minutes each. It is packet in a Nylon Zipper Burgundy bag and the quality of the sound recorded is excellent. The way how the Bible is read is also very, very good, even to persons that have only a few years of English and do not use it everyday as a spoken language. Who can do better for such a price?"
2,Don't Buy This Book,"Aside from its smug and pretentious writing style, this book is filled with factual inaccuracies and overloaded with trivia that wasn't helpful to me at all. The author could have written about what it's like to live on a boat or what it's like to cruise on the East Coast or even why he chose to cruise the Great Loop. Instead I got treated to page after page of half-baked history (copied from tourist brouchures) and tales of personal slights (real and imagined) from marina owners, fellow boaters, and any local unlucky enough to meet up with 'Grumpy' when things weren't going his way. Don't buy this book. There are others that are better written and more positive.I recommend A Year in Paradise: How We Lived Our Dream by Stephen Watterson"
4,Laugh a little.,"The first few chapters of this book made me laugh out loud,as the Stobs struggle to learn about their new boat and deal with the invariable problems with a new-used boat. Then the book settled down into a straight travelog, interspersed with a little strained humor. Worth reading. Gave me a new interest in cruising the Tennessee-Tom Bigbee."
3,A good guide to a great experience,"I enjoyed reading this book, though I don't think it was especially well written. It is the author's experiences and attention to detail that make ""Honey, Let's Get a Boat..."" worth reading. What I didn't like was his overuse of the simile...it just seemed flowery and excessive. Also, the book could use a bit of editing/proofreading. I do think that Mr. Stob's writing improves as the book progresses, it is almost as though he learned to write as he wrote. Undeniably an important resource for anyone planning a long cruise on the ""Great Loop."""
3,mediocre soul album,"It's good and nice and smooth, but has no big hits. A steady Full Force production. I liked their debut a bit better."
4,This bag is NOT canvas,"It's a beautiful bag but, I purchased it for daytime thinking it was red canvas. It's red Leather Suede with Navy Blue straps (I thought they would be black)"
3,Not big enough,I found this to not be big enough to hold the Stanley Fat Max tape measure. I use the 25' and it fits tightly in this holder. Other than that it seems like a good unit.
4,dog furminator,"Seems to work good. It also seems to remove a lot of hair. I have a 5 lb. Chihuahua so I don't use it very often as I don't want a bald doggie. Just be a little gentle and don't use it everyday on a small, short haired dog. Worth the money. Makes hair shine."
4,Good choice for cats that hate brushes!,"My kitty hates being brushed with other brushes and will immediately start biting them. He's not really fond of this one, either, but at least tolerates it for a few seconds at a time before trying to bite it. He's short haired so thankfully we don't have to brush him too much, and we make the experience more pleasant for him by giving him treats as he gets brushed. I like how well the fur adheres to the plastic and that it's pretty easy to get the fur off, especially if there's a lot of it. My one complaint is that the glove is HUGE- my thumb can't even reach the thumb of the mitten, but I guess it's better too big than too small! One thing that I think is kind of funny is that I have to go over the mitten with a lint brush after using it because fur sticks to the fabric part badly. This is probably a good choice for cats that hate brushes but like being petted. Oh and we call it the Kitten Mitten!"
1,Nick Nack price guide for parlor collectors.,"The book looks very promising at first glance. You get a 4 page history (nothing here). Chapter two is 50 pages of oil cans , moth spray and home drip oil cans dated through 1989. Mainly 20/30 buck stuff.(moth balls and parrifin,WOW).After pages of Maps, credit cards,calenders,salt & pepper shakers and ice scrapers, now the meat.Pumps and globes.I was ready.18 common globes pictured, I can accept that.Two whole gas pumps pictured.(50's Tokheim,wow).A small globe list.1/3 page(no pics).Then 70 pages of signs, patches, uniforms,toys. No mention of years of pumps built specifically for Sohio,the hundreds of offshute globes used. Islander lights,air machines, the stuff you drove up to are not to be found here. All the unique to Sohio station things in the 30's,40's,50's. Not pictured here.If your looking for that memory of pulling into an old ""modern"" Sohio,this book is a blackhole. Great icing, NO CAKE!"
2,Dont last long at all,"These batteries were a piece of crap. They did not hold a charge, but as far as the company goes, they shipped the product right away. Too bad for them that they don't know that these batteries dont hold a very long charge."
5,"2 and a half seasons, more to come.","Few shows stay in our minds so may years after they have been gone. For me Touched by an Angel was one of the best shows to express warmth to its viewers. Every episode has an uplifting message, and the series is so full and rich I can't wait till the rest of the seasons are released. This third season is quite long indeed, and it introduces to the spin off of The Promised Land. Personally, I could never get really attracted to this other series. Nonetheless all the episodes have the quality the entire show always demonstrated. Roma Downey is and will always be a beautiful and very talented actress. Her role as the angel Monica captivated many of us, and Della Reese was as charming as only she can be. Quite a little treasure, this series is."
5,a balanced view,"This book deserves five stars. Not because it is an exhaustive account of the first war but because it restores the balance. We have many English language texts on this subject but Arthur Waley, the distinguished sinologist, has become, with this slim volume, an extremely good historian. Using Chinese sources, occasionally adding clarifications from elsewhere, he has achieved a delightful, wistful, plaintive, penetrative and endlessly readable slim volume that finally enables the non-Chinese language reader to enter into what really motivated officials and simple, if middle class, Chinese people in the opium war - the seemingly unbridgable gulf that to this day divides East and West is washed away in this collection of notes from Commissioner Lin's diary and elsewhere, recording what it was like to be there at the time, the perplexity of the citizen and revealing the Chinese, through their thoughtful comments and opinions, their hopes and fears, as precisely like you and I. Read it."
4,Good strong disc,it was cool having two of Funks Greatest minds on one Album together The Genius Mind of George Clinton&The Genius Mind of Sly Stone.Electric Spanking of war babies was a trip out jam.The Grooves never let up.this is a Good solid Album.Free Your Mind&Let the Soul-N-Funk Follow.
1,Not a quality item,Bought one at a local store because I needed it quick. Paid $2 more than at Amazon. Product didn't have a socket that would fit my 13/16 lugs even though it was marked as having one. My belief is that the sockets were mis-sized or the extra paint they put on it prevented it from fitting. As well I noticed that some of the socket holes were not centered on the bar leaving the socket side wall thinner on one side. All in all I was not impressed by the quality so I took it back and just used a socket and breaker bar to get the tire off. If you can't trust their quality control getting the socket sizes correct and centered how can you trust their metallurgy?
3,Not Much Bang for the Buck,"I bought the horse for my two-year-old son, and neither he nor my six-year-old daughter have much interest in it now, a week after Christmas. It's cute, but it doesn't do a whole lot. For example, ""riding"" the horse involves sitting on it while it makes clip-clop sounds (but doesn't otherwise move). And it doesn't ""eat"" its carrot very convincingly--the mouth just opens and closes a time or two. In sum, it's way too expensive for just an over-sized stuffed animal with a few sounds and motions."
3,A lot of fun for a DAY..,"We bought this horse for our girls the first year they came out (several years ago). They had the stuffed horse with out batteries, that they could sit on and they loved it. They would drag it all through the house and played with it all the time, so when we saw this life like horse we thought for sure it would be a hit. My girls did enjoy it, for the day, and then they were done with it. They couldn't drag it through the house and ""wrestle"" with it like the other horse. My kids are all grown now and I have found time and time again that kids like to use their imagination and this toy doesn't allow it. THey much prefer the simple horse that didn't make sounds and didn't require batteries. By the way this toy takes a lot of batteries and they were dead by the end of Christmas Day...well used, but that gets expensive!!!"
5,I love her,"I got this toy on craigslist real cheap 100$.I am only 8 years old and I went with my mom to get butterscotch.I wanted butterscotch affter I got my mom's frend smors pony 4 her b-day.realy grate toy,I have real ponys 2 but butterscotch i can take inside the house.I put Butterscotch out in my horses pen, and they reacted really funny!"
2,Waste of money,"My daughter wanted this pony SO bad for Christmas last year. She was 4 then, and loved horses. She spent an hour in the toy store playing with it, so we thought this was perfect. Well, she thought it was the best thing for about a week, and she never really played with it again. It has been sitting in our playroom for a year. She is now 5, and still doesn't play with it. Our other daughter, 2-1/2, doesn't play with it either. Their friends come over and look at it for a few minutes, and they don't play with it. I really wish we didn't spend so much money on this toy."
5,Delightful,"I've loved these candies since I was a child. The creme center is just the right flavor and texture to complement the caramel. The caramels are nice and soft, and they are tasty without being too sweet. Highly recommended!"
4,Beautiful but small,"This is so pretty, just not as big as I thought it would be. Not too many napkins can be placed in it at a time and only small ones at that. Those must be folded so as not to flop over the top. We have a family of 8 and it has to be refilled every night after dinner. But again, very nice quality and sparkle!"
2,AN UNEVEN EFFORT............,"This CD is by far not the worst Reba has ever done. Take almost any one of her 90s projects and that will be the case. This one is uneven containing some traditional country and some of the pop filler she's been recording for years now. Cathy's Clown is excellent for her. ""Til Love Comes Again"" is a traditional tune with steel and fiddles but she's done better. ""It Always Rains on Saturday"" is merely o.k. ""Walk On"" is outstanding. I love that. ""Little Girl"" is lacklaster. The rest...I won't comment on because I'm not impressed by Reba at Sixteen."
2,THIS ONE HAD POSSIBILITIES,"This one has some good stuff on it but not enough for me to give it more than 2 stars. ""Cathy's Clown"" is a good cover, something Reba usually don't do well. I also like ""A New Love"", ""Walk On"", and ""It Always Rains on Saturday"". The standout is ""Till Love Comes Again""."
5,Great deal,"Using this for a hop yard. It is strung up 14 feet above ground and attached to 4' earth anchors on each side. I accidentally caught the ROPS of my tractor on the wire that comes down to the 4' anchors and lifted my tractor off the front two wheels. Only thing it did to the wire was strech it out a little. The 1400 pound limit is very low, this wire can take closer to 5-7k pounds until breaking, according to another website."
2,Disappointed,"I was happy to see this item available at such a reasonable cost however, when viewing the episodes, some of them had problems - skipping sections of the video or just stopping for 10 - 20 seconds and them continuing."
4,Good quality,"I can't complain about the quality of the product. It's well packaged and contains exactly what the product description says it does. It tastes ok (considering Royal Jelly is not exactly an appealing flavor for my taste buds). The product is mixed with honey which helps make it more palatable. I feel great since I have been using this product. I can't really be sure if it is due to the royal jelly, but if it's not then what an awfully strange coincidence."
3,Ok... But hard to swallow...,"I used the entire container and never felt any difference in my energy level. Maybe it takes more than one, but at that price, one should have made some change, no matter if it were small, I should have felt something."
5,Excellent Quality Stamp Set,I have never been let down by Melissa and Doug products and this stamp set continues to increase my faith in their brand. This is an excellent wooden set with both upper and lower case complete alphabet sets with four colors to choose from. The set provides hours of fun for my young child learning to spell and identify letters. She loves playing with it and writing notes with her new stamp set. This was a great buy and a great value. Love it!
2,Impossible to kern!,"Okay so I must not be in the right demographic, since i know this is targeted at kids. However, I got them to create a hand-stamped title on a self-made book cover, and was extremely disappointed in how hard these are to make look nice. I don't know if this goes the same way with all type-stamps, but i think it has to do with the fact that the letters are in the middle of a square shaped stamp, therefore making it impossible to kern right."
2,"Stamps are great, INK pad is terrible","We have gotten very little use out of this set, not as much as I hoped. My daughter was excited about it at first until we tried using it. The ink pad is terrible and barely works so her letters could barely be seen. I tried to wet it and that did not help. I tried using an existing ink pad I had and it worked, but my daughter specifically wanted a rainbow pad like what came with the set. Until I get new ink pads for this the product is not going to get any use. Unfortunately she already has a bad attitude about it and it is likely she will not want to try it again."
3,"Good book, but inevitably too general for some","I found this book to be very useful, don't get me wrong, but I found that it was a little bit too general. For instance, when I was curious about what a ""fixed gear"" (single speed, no freewheel) bicycle was, I found nothing, not one word, about this type of bicycle. This may be a little bit extreme of a case, since fixed gear bicycles seem to be a bit of a cult thing, but the book is definitely a general reference. A good start, but not the last book I'll buy on bicycles."
1,defective,"Had to return unit. Lexmark was very helpful, sent a new, upgraded printer and provided return label for the old one. New model, a X3500-4500 series works just fine."
1,Corporate disregard for consumer,"I own a Lexmark Z32 ink jet printer. I upgraded my operating system to Mac OSX 10.4.11 and the printer no longer worked. I contacted Lexmark and they responded ""Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the problems you are experiencing with your Lexmark product. To the best of my knowledge, there are currently no plans to develop Mac(10.4.11) drivers to support this model. Thank you for notifying us of this request."" So before you buy a Lexmark, think about whether the company will be there for you."
1,"Good idea, lousy product","The small size and long hose make it convenient, but its poor performance renders it useless. It is very loud, clogs often and the tools fall off the hose too easy. I mounted it on the wall in the garage and thought it would be great for quick cleanups of the car and floor. It does neither well. The small hose diameter and poor suction stop it from picking up any large items. (It will not pick up leaves off the garage floor). To make maters worse the hose size is identical to the disposable clear plastic caps on top of water bottles. If you happen to vacuum one up, it gets stuck in the hose and takes quite a bit of time and effort to get out. I rarely use it anymore. A cordless dust buster has more power and is much quieter."
3,Noisy,I got this as a Christmas gift for my workshop. I like that it stores up and out of the way but it is noisy. I had to contact Shop Vac because the hose also made an extrememly loud whistling sound when operating. They said it was a common problem and sent me a new hose. With the new hose the whistling has stopped. I mainly vacuum saw dust and dirt as it won't suck anything substatial in size all the way through the hose. For small clean up it is fine but that's about it.
3,Inexpensive Vacuum,"Purchased this for my daughters home. this inexpensive vacuum works as good as my $1,100.00 vacuum in my home just needs to be cleaned more often.."
4,pz's shopvac,"Very handy and powerful. Would have liked an exhaust port for air blowing of tools, etc."
5,Want the secret of a great pick up?,You really need to try this vaccuum cleaner. It's probably the best one I've ever owned!! It works better than some of the more expensive ones I've had over the years. Try it for yourself. You'll be glad you did.
3,fussy user,"This is being typed by the wife of the user, and is being dictated by my husband. One note from me: He is VERY fussy!""The shape was just what I was looking for. I am using it as a dust-collector for my table saw. Haven't used it much.I found the standard mounting inflexible. The inlet for the hose is inconveniently placed. The power cord is shorter than I wanted."""
1,You're Chance to purchase a COMMERCIAL,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting the ""Live Concert"" DVD to be a mix of performances by the bands who perform at CreationFest. Instead you get 3 songs peformed by Jeremy Camp and then 3-4 songs Performed by the Newsboys. In between that you get a lot of people talking about CreationFest - there are a few good testimonies by band members, but still all that should have been saved for the 2nd DVD which is all Documentary-style footage from the festival. I expected a lot more Live Concert Performances on the supposedly Live Concert DVD which seems much more like a 45 minute commercial for the festival.I would return it for a refund if I could - there are already 2 way better DVD's if all you want is Jeremy Camp Live and Newsboys Live. Oh well, live and learn..."
5,weekender,"i use this bag everyday. i love it.i have so many bags and this is my new favorite.as a community nurse, my car is my office and this bag has become my portable work station. it has pockets all around the inside so even though i carry a ton of stuff i can find what i need.at times i have carried so much junk that i could not get it zippered..it takes all my abuse and still looks new.may come back for other colors."
5,In the usual style of Fr. Louie,"As usual, his journal style leads me into deep contemplation, but his honesty in dealing with all issues reminds the reader that he is a man before a monk or priest. I reccommend this book to all Seminary Students and those seeking quiet prayer and contemplation."
1,EVEN REBA'S FACE ON THE COVER SPEAKS DEFIANCE!,"Reba said she was tired of ""traditional"" country and defied anyone to stop her. Well they couldn't stop her but they also couldn't stop me from hating this CD with a passion!!! So, So Long and RESPECT are the worst of the lot. ""Sunday Kind of Love"" suffers horribly because of Reba's vocal which is not suited to torch. The other songs are only the beginning of her bubblegum pop phase which we would have had to endure to the present day."
3,nice alternative rock,"when i heard this cd i was pretty dissapointed. I had been a fan of them since i had heard four minute mile when it first came out a couple years ago. Though i can not deny the get up kids are an extremely catchy band, and this is cd is better than most alternative cds, it is nothing close to four minute mile. It loses the emotion and power, not to mention their traces of punk rock. This cd is pure power pop, it's a cd filled with radio friendly songs, and not the powerful sounds i associate the guk's with."
1,"Unfortunately, I think the Get Up Kids got up.","I never thought I'd hear my favorite band go from emo to alternative, for lack of a better description. They were one of the best bands out there to hit the emotion keys by changing tempos and belting out a healthy screaming or two. Now they seem so happy and mainstream. I heard most of these songs at their show, and they sounded MUCH better, because they put feeling into them, and made them reminiscent of The Get Up Kids three years ago. The album just doesn't grab me like ""3 Minute Mile"" or ""Woodson"" did. All in all, I'm not gonna dog these guys, because I love and respect their previous offerings. If you've never heard the Get Up Kids, you'll love it. If you've been a fan for a while, you probably already own it, and feel much the same way I do."
3,"this cd was awesome, but not better than Four Minute Mile","I read the other reveiws, and those people shouldn't care if it's emo or not, but it is true, Four Minute Mile is better than this cd. I like emo more than Alternative rock, and this cd is Alternative. So, you decide, if you like emo, go with Four Minute Mile, if you like Alternative, go with this, it's up to you. Or you could buy both, because they are both good cd's."
3,"good, but they've been better","this is a very good cd, but it doesn't catch the emo ways of ""4 minute mile"" good cd, but get 4 minute mile over this"
2,Four-Minute Mile is MUCH better,"Four-Minute Mile is one of my favorite albums of all time. I bought this one without having heard a single one of it's songs believing that it would be great, but it's not, not at all. It's way to watered down and mainstream sounding. The rough production of FMM was much nicer to listen to than this commercialized stuff on STWHA. I just can't get over how much better the Get Up Kids used to be. Another good one to check out is the Woodsen EP.It's sad that the Get Up Kids went from being such an awesome band with so much heart to being just another sell out. Four-Minute Mile was a masterpiece ..."
1,Misrepresented strength - not 1g,"Although this particular item is listed as a 1g dosage, it is not. It is 1g per serving with a serving size of three tablets. So the dosage per pill is more like 350mg."
1,Big n' Cheap,"I laughed when I saw this thing in person but I wasnt suprised due to the price I paid for it. The current price is way to high for the level of quality your getting. I've yet to take this in the shower because I don't think it will survive. At least I can still use it externally for some stimulation.Pros:1. Silicone: phalate free toy for under $4 (at least when I placed my order)Cons:1. Cheaply made: you generally get what you pay for when it comes to toys. Mold lines, asymetrical shape (one side is bigger then the other) and a very very cheapy vibrator motor and battery compartment.2. Size: unless you really like a very thick diameter toy your not going to have much luck with this one plus the odd extra ""wave"" which apparently was designed for extra g-spot stimulation make penetration pretty difficult. I can imagine this being very uncomfortable for the average user."
1,Not even fun,The best thing to say is that I like the color. It is like trying to start a fire with a wet match.
4,A Great Record,"""Goodbye Race"" is one of my favorite records... It starts off with a wonderful song called ""Albert's Twisted Memory Bank"" and they take it a step higher with the song ""Pecola"" and then they calm down with ""Shutters Closed."" They got some credit for ""Shutters Closed"" and made a cool video to that song, But they didn't get enough credit for this great record..."
3,Many Stories The Same,"Saunders is a master of the idomatic chatter of everyday characters and their tortured inner monologues. Unfortunately, Civilwarland suffers in comparison to his much better and more recent collection Pastoralia.The problem is that the settings for the stories in Civilwarland are all very similar, often set in marginal businesses and in jokey theme parks. Although Saunders gets the management-speak perfectly, it becomes wearing as each story is virtually the same in setting and tone.As much as I love his style, I found this collection hard going. One reviewer here at Amazon has said that you should read one Saunders short story every month and that seems about right to me."
4,Almost Historic Tales From Wisconsin,The title says it best. This is a collection of tales and legends from Wisconsin. Some of the recollections are barely a paragraph long; other tales go on for pages. But for those of us who fomdly recall listening to the tales and legends our uncles and grandsfathers and their friends used to spin as we sat around the campfire at night will appreciate these yarns. They recount the true legends and lore timelessly woven into the fabric of Wisconsin history.
5,dremel575,begause its one of mani usefull dremel attachment you can trust dill and grind polish you can drill in tide spaces
1,defective,it has not screw.the whole screw was pressed inside.i cant you the product.i am very dissapointed.then i thought i would buy that small part that has screw but i cant find it either.
3,Love / Hate Relationship,"These are essential for some of the work I do, but I have already killed two of them. If I think of it like wearing out a grinding wheel, it's not quite so aggravating. If you want it to last a while. I would suggest lubricating the shaft often and running at lower rpm's."
3,Would be fine for a beginner,I purchased this because I was having trouble changing chords quickly. This DVD is okay but the chord changing exercises are pretty slow so it didn't help me much. Would be fine for a beginner though as it is a well done DVD.
1,NOT for people with sensitive teeth!,"I'd like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth. After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold. Brushing also became unbearably painful, all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush. The company unfortunately would not issue a refund. If there had been a warning on the packaging regarding this issue, I would not have purchased the product. Buyer beware."
2,disappointed again,"After putting ""Sins of the Night"" into my recycle bin after reading the first two pages, I swore off Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books as being terribly written and horribly convoluted in plot. I did okay, really, until I fell for a pretty face- that wonderful guy with the magic eyes on the cover of The Dream Hunter-- and I thought, 'a new character, a new plot line... maybe Ms. Kenyon will have a rennaissance."" So, fool that I am, I bought the book. 10 days later, I am still slogging through it- could it be that I have to read back constantly to figure out the numerous gods and demi-gods-from different pantheons, mind you- running around the story? Or could it be the card-board main characters- I keep lifting them up to see if there is anything more than two dimensions! Sorry, this one cured me for sure. I won't be back unless Ms. Kenyon has a guardian goddess who can 'plunk her magic twanger' and make Ms. Kenyon's writing improve a great deal."
2,Predictable,"Megaera is looking for Atlantis and has wild dreams about a guy named Arik, who turns out to be a dream god. Arik makes a deal with Hades to be human, but in exchange he has to kill Megaera.Nearly everything about this book is typical and cliche, although I did like the premise. The writing is subpar, but easily readable. The plot is neatly tied up at the end for the sake of the romance and a very predictable happy ending."
1,$1.00 used was too much for this book,"This book was so dumb it made my brain hurt. Frumpy archaeologist meets walking contradiction god-thing and the search for Atlantis kicks into high gear. . . .Blarg!I'm also forced to wonder if this author does any cultural research in her writing besides keeping a copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology around. As someone who has a degree in Classics, I was trying not to scream while eeking my way through this story.There were so many characters on that boat, it made me wonder if I was supposed to be reading about some kind of demented singles cruise.This is yet another author I've heard was hot bananas who turned out to be hot air."
1,"Awful ""Mary Sue""....with ancient gods....gag.","Very little history, lots of sex....vanity novel, the author is ""Mary Sue"" with the main male character. Boring and dull...don't waste your money."
2,A Total Miss!!,"With Sherrilyn, you usually get a hit or a miss. This was a TOTAL miss. I won't go into the plot, but will note that it's flat and the pacing of the story is extremely slow. In other words, this was one of the most ""boring"" books that I've read in a while. The timeline was ""funky,"" and quite frankly, you didn't learn a whole lot more in this story than you've learned in previous stories.I honestly think that Sherrilyn has way too many series going on. I mean she must have 5 or 6 going on simultaneously. It's just too much. The writing is bound to suffer at some point. This book is a prime example of that.I read on her website that it can take Sherrilyn as little as 2 weeks to write an entire book. After reading Dream Hunter, I can honestly believe it. You may want to get this one from your library. I can only thank the Good Lord that it wasn't sold in hardback."
1,Can't get into it,I think I'm going to lay off her books for a while. I've been disappointed with the last 3 books. I can't get past the first chapter. I tried skipping but thaat just gave me a headache. What a waste of 7.99!
2,I really can't get into it,"I have been trying for over a week to read this book. I have no sympathy for any of the characters. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more, if the story didn't start in 1990. I don't know. I would suggest waiting and buying this book used. This book just does not reach out and grab me like her other book do.Karen"
4,Quaint and unsettling all at the same time..,"I saw this documentary on Sundance channel a few months ago, and ended up showing it to most of my non-jewish friends as soon as possible. This doc is highly entertaining, shocking at times, but still maintaining a sense of humor about that subject matter that's never inappropriate. I recommend this film for anyone Jewish or not, who struggles with the meaning of ""Jewish Identity"", or anyone who has convinced themselves that anti-semitism has been relegated to Eastern Europe and the Deep South.This won't answer questions everyone has on the subject, but it will provoke plenty of discussion and reflection among the people who watch it."
1,Horrible,You are right this gun steinks i get the gun and when i open it out of the box it wieghs NOTHING it seems like a slab of plastic then when i test it a peice of the plastic broke off it doesnt come with batterys and the fireing is horrible i would rate this a -10 it steinks
1,dont bother,"this gun is really bad. sure it looks wicked cool but it breaks wicked easy. the saftey broke on mine so sometimes it shoots and sometimes it doesnt. the first night i used it, it was already shooting bad. my friend got 1 too and something broke with the internals. ethier buy a colt 1911 made by some other company besides JLS ot just get a glock with a silencer like i am."
1,Dont waste your money,I bought 2 of these for my garage. They functioned fine until after a few months one quit working. I did not bother sending it back because it wasnt worth the effort. The other quit working before it was a year old. Neither works with battery or AC power. I wish had saved my money and used a tennis ball on a string instead of this gadget.
1,Unreliable,"I've owned this device for about six months now. I installed it according to manufacturer's recommendations. My garage is clean and new. The device is unable to reliably detect the position of our honda odyssey. It appears to calibrate the initial position fine, which is about 3 feet from the wall. But any subsequent attempts to park only produce a yellow light as I get less than a foot from the wall. I presume that it is a problem with the sharp nose of our van. I rigged up a bracket to angle the transmitter at about a 45 degree angle from the wall at a height of about five feet from the floor in hopes of reflecting the ultrasound better off the angled hood of our van, but this only marginally improved things. Overall, I can't rely on it to safely park our car. I should have returned it."
3,Not perfect.,"This seemed like the perfect thing for my garage. I didn't want something that just popped on all of a suden like most parking aids, I wanted a gradual alert - and in fact I wanted a street light. Then I found this, and thought it must be too good to be true. Sadly, it is.While it technically works as advertised, it doesn't always work at all. And, I almost never get a Green light - usually just Yellow, then Red. And no, I don't speed into my garage. ;)Sometimes however, I don't get anything at all. Or, nothing will happen, and when I've decided I've parked myself, and get of my vehicle, it turns Red all of a sudden.So, in theory this is a great product, but in actual use it seems to have a lot of bugs that still need to worked out. I've had this up in my garage for about 6 months now, so this isn't just a few rare occurrences."
4,Works well once configured,"The first one I got didn't work correctly, it never would configure itself properly (kept blinking the red light). After getting the first one replaced, it seems to work pretty well. Makes backing the truck in super easy, which the old tennis ball doesn't help with at all.Amazon is amazing in the return process though. They are very fast to ship replacements, and very graceful in the amount of time you have to return the old one. They provide an easy way of printing out a label too, the whole return process couldn't have been better."
5,Every garge should have one,"This litlle piece of technology has saved me from running into the wall of my garage so many times I can't count. I can't imagine parking in my garage with out it, I have now had this for almost 4 years and have had no issues with it at all."
1,PZ-1900,"Well I ordered the (2)PZ-1500, because I had this model in the past and it worked. However, I received (2) PZ-1900. The PZ-1500 has two sonar transmitters and cost about $4.50 more than the PZ-1900. The PZ-1900 has only one transmitter and I can't get it to work as it is detailed in the instructions. I basically wasted my money.Park Zone PZ-1900 Platinum Dual Power Garage Parking Aid"
2,Description should contain disclaimers,"When I read the installation instructions on this unit, I discovered that the installation requires some pretty specific conditions. My garage does not fit those limitations. I cannot speak to how the unit works as I didn't install it, however, I think the manufacturer should list the installation condition requirements in their description. Unless you have a clear, unobstructed, full wall in front of your cars and can park them back 1.5 to 3 feet from the wall, then this unit will not function in your garage (according to the directions)."
4,parking,I bought two of the PZ-1500. Easy to install and easy to calibrate. No tenis ball to bump into or stop to trip over.
1,Do not buy two of these!!!,"I purchased one of the parkzone in March 2003. It worked fine. I was so impressed that I ordered another for the other side of my garage. It too worked for a period of a month, then started acting up. I reset it changed battery to no avail.I then calledMeasurement Specialties to find out what was wrong and was inform that you can't used two in the same garage. I informed them it had worked for a month. They said that some when tested did for awhile. So I'm stuck with it. No refund by Amazon.com because of the 30 day policy on returns and no refund from Measurement Specialties.For this reason I gave it a one!!!"
2,NON-precision garage parking solution.,"This product could be a great aid in parking your car in your garage without hitting the back wall but, it does not work at distances closer than 1 foot. I need to bring the front bumper of my car to within 1 to 2 inches of the device. The Park-Zone turns red when I come closer than 12 inches. I had to resort to a block of wood that I feel as I come within 2 inches of the back wall. Bottom line: if you have more than 12 to 15 inches from your bumper to the back wall when your car in completely in the garage, the product is reliable. If you need to come closer than 12 inches, this product is not for you."
2,Not as good as expected,"I have had this item for over two years and it sometimes works and mostly doesnt, usually falls off the wall. Great idea, product needs improvement."
2,donst work that well,dosnt work all the time when it does it is helful. but overall not the best product
1,2-sensor version does not work at all,"I have the 2-sensor version and it hardly ever works. Every now and then the lights will go from green to red as advertised, but sometimes it will just sit at yellow even after you have passed the safe point. In fact, today, mine stayed yellow so I advanced the car and completely obliterated the sensor with the cars bumper. After the sensor was completely crushed, it still read yellow, and it never changed to red. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment because I went and ordered another one, this time the version with only 1-sensor. I'm hoping that the reviews below are accurate and the 1-sensor version is much better."
4,Stop Me Park Zone,"This model is a much improved product from the previous PZ-1100. The problem with the PZ-1100 was that it was battery operated and that you couldn't park within 1-2 feet of the device or it wouldn't stop you accurately.The new PZ-1500 is great that you don't have to use the batteries. Just plug it in and it is ready to go. It still has a little problem with parking too close and keeping the distance accurate. We park 6 inches from the wall and it has trouble with that short of distance. It still works, but it turns red about 3 inches before I would like it to. I'm not going to complain as it works MUCH better than the previous model. I think it would work great if you set it about 12 inches to your car."
2,Park-Zone,"Had a previous one that was much better. Do not know what they changed, but this one goes through batteries like water."
5,A great book for anyone interested in Alzheimer's disease,"Decoding Darkness provides not only the scientific facts about what is known about Alzheimer's disease, but also the historical aspects behind it. This book is a very interesting book to read. I thought it would be another textbook-like format explaining about Alzheimer's disease, but it was more like a detective novel developing into the current state of Alzheimer's disease research in reality. This book was written by one of the very first in the frontiers of Alzheimer's disease research. The information should be accurate and most current."
2,"need a better , more efficient juicer","I got my juicer from big Deal via Amazon. It just had some problem to begin with .The second time I used it, the juicer started jumping and make loud noises. Then 4th time I used it, the motor stopped working. I am returning my juicer .And going for Champion."
1,Terrible piece of garbage,"I was given this juicer for christmas, what a piece of junk! I was so excited to start juicing and gaining health, but you cannot CANNOT juice anything but cucumbers and green apples in this piece of crud. You put anything that is a leafy green in there and you don't get juice. The pulp from the things you can juice is still FULL of liquid. If you try and juice anything that is remotely fleshy like an orange it goes crazy and gets off balance and tries to fling itself off the counter. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OMEGA. They also have dismal customer service. When I called to ask about this product the gentleman I spoke to was more interested in speaking over me and explaining that many people enjoy the product even though it doesnt juice anything but firm fruits and veggies. They offered zero help. I would suggest not buying anything from Omega company. Spread the word!"
2,Great Design,"The design very nice, great power but very poor storage of the pulp, and there comes a time in which begins to vibrate and is the pulp, does not fill or a glass of juice when you have this problem."
1,Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.,"The Juicer leaked badly on the first use, and then went crazy and started spinning in a rough way on the kitchen countertop causing breaking several glassware and causing terror to my wife and kids. I rushed to unplug the wire but it kept spinning and shaking in strange way for 5 more minutes. Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.I will contact my congresswomen to raise the issue of unsafe house appliances and equipment sold in the market with no federal supervision. I'm also looking into taking legal action against the company for damage done to my kitchen and kitchenware."
4,Misleading Photo,"I am very pleased with my Omega 9000 juicer except for the color. I wanted black! I received white. I shopped all over for black and went with Amazon for my purchase because the photo showed it in black. I knew there was a possibility that it was being misrepresented because black was hard to find. There was no color listed in Amazon's ad, only the one photo in black (even though the juicer comes in black or white).I am disappointed in you Amazon."
2,Little help here,"Someone sold me a used sailboard for use on Midwestern lakes; I was clueless how to use it. Unfortunately this book did not provide much help. It taught me the parts, and gave some instruction on how to put them together. It was of little help on how to actually do it, devoting about 3 pages to this topic."
4,Great reference book,"This is one for the coffee table. Cheap, and well worth a minor investment. Details a majority of the breaks out there, but does however, miss a few. Fun to look back into an era past."
2,Way too much ground to cover in one tiny book.,"The books starts out well enough, and has a comprehensive list of techniques, but there is very little discussion on where power comes from, common mistakes, etc.The hyungs section leaves a lot to be desired, often leaving out transitional moves, or showing non-helpful pictures (shot from the rear)An OK reference book if you can't remember a certain move, but you're better off saving your money and gettting either TSD Volume II by JC Shin, or Soo Bahk Do by Hwang Kee. More expensive, yes, but pricesless in terms of info."
4,Mars Fever!,"Having only read one short story by Bradbury before this book, both his style and the genre (in book form) were new to me. This compilation of stories are all dated in the future, from the 'magical' sci-fi year of 1999 (which in the forties and fifties must have seemed a long long way away) and although individual stories, they read like diary entries.Varied in length, with some just a couple of paragraphs or pages long, the balance works well because the shorter stories are to the point and punctuate the longer ones. Although classed as science fiction, set on (or about travelling to) Mars, the main theme running though all of them is how human's react to situations. Racial tension, loneliness, hope, fear and greed all play a part in these deftly put together stories and whether they're about being isolated on a planet, met by long dead loved ones or children just being children, they each have something to offer and leave you in ponderous mode."
1,The Martian Chronicles,I was disappointed - it was a 'cheap' version of the book - small and on inferior paper. i was disappointed but didn't have any time to research another one - it was a gift. This has happened before when i've used Amazon.
4,Entertaining Collection of short stories,"Presented is an interesting take on a ""futuristic"" takeover of Mars by inhabitors of the third planet from the Sun. What transpires is a series of expeditions to Mars by men from America.They are greeted with everything from murderous rage, indifference, nostalgia, and an extinct planet.Throughout the tale, which spans a period of 27 years, there are hints of a global breakdown on Earth, which is slowing tearing itself apart.While an entertaining read, the only complaint that I have is that this reads like a collection of tales, with only slight hints at continuity throughout the novel. Otherwise, I very much recommend this book."
2,It was not good,"There was only one chapter I liked in this book and that was The Martian because I like action and this book was not even close to what I had in mind,of good entertainment. But the one reason I liked this chapter is how he dies at the end.The story I hated was Usher 2 because I really did not understand it."
2,"Creative imagination, yet so unfulfilling","I read this book in my eleventh grade honors class as a science-fiction selection. I felt like I was reading through a child's imagination. It was very adventurous. But, to me it was too easy. There wasn't much depth, it was just ""plain and simple."" We are now reading Cold Mountain, and by no means does this book compare in any way, any way at all. My least favorite section in the book was Ylla, and my most favorite was -And the Moon Be Still as Bright. Really I liked the last chapter the most, for the simple fact that it was THE LAST, and I knew that Ild be finished soon. I read the first 3-4 sections hopoing that it would get better, and then when it didn't, I had to force myself to finish it, so that I wouldn't fail the exam over it. The only reason I finished this book, most deffinatly, was because it was for class."
2,"The Martian Chronicles, a bizarre scientific voyage.","I really did not like this book. The series of stories needed more of an underlying meaning towards each other. It was a basic killing and taking advantage of book. Personally, I would of rather not read the book."
4,A Book to Remember,"I'm a freshman in high school and about a month ago we reciceved Martian Chronicles. A majority of the students say the books boring and some of upper classmen(sophmores,juniores,seniors) say this is the worst book in the freshman level. Actually it's not that bad. I like how they have mini stories in the book even though it gets confusing. It's pretty funny of how in 1999 people can go to Mars, but Bradbury had a good imgination.If you are an African-American who gets offended easily by racial slurs. I'm not sure that this would be the book for you, because in a mini story there is a white man who just criticizes and threatens a character,who is black and uses racial slurs.Anyway I'll keep this book, it's a book I'll remember for some time."
4,The Martian Chronicles,"This book is better than the 1980s movie. Parts of the original story, that could have made the movie great, are not cut out. The story not only deals with interplanetary exploration; it also deals with interplanetary racism, murder, bigotry and conquest. Especially the idiocy of the first earth expeditions. A good read!"
5,Vintage Bradbury at his finest.,"I remember being given a tattered copy of this book at age 11 by my grandmother, who had bought it at some garage sale ""because I knew you liked space and all that"". Little did she realize the tremendous gift that she bestowed upon me. I read the book twice and then raided the local library for every bit of Bradbury I could lay hands on. I became a Bradbuy fan overnight. My kind-hearted librarian looked quizically at me when I requested a map to look up Green Town, Illinois.At that young age I realized that this, my friends, is how you do it right. I have yet to read Mr. Bradbuy's equal in both power and poetry. There are many imitators, but only one original.If you have a young son, daughter, niece, nephew, or neighbor (or combination of the aforementioned) who are avid readers and are approximately 11 years of age, do yourself a favor and give this book as a special gift to encourage a lifelong love of this fine artist's work."
5,It shows man's trails to settle on Mars,"This is a great book about how stupid mankind can be, but also how smart they can be. The ups and downs of cencery and the government. And how all poeple not matter what World they are from are still the same in someways."
2,my book lost,"The first delivery lost and I counted myself on that book for a work, lost time and money, the second package I arrive well, but when she asks for first they continue to me on time assuring that arrive"
1,Martian Chronicals Review,"The book Martian Chronicals by Ray Bradbury is ,if not the worst, one of the worst books I have ever read. Not only was the plot poorly developed, but the words used were used poorly. Certainly one of the worst examples of writing that I have seen. Ray Bradbury has never been my favorite author but this book was simply horid. It was not only graphic but also inappropriate for people under the age of 18. It was also offensive to people between the ages of 22 and 93. If I could I would give this book 0 stars. This book was definitely a turn off to reading."
4,The Foresight of the Apocolypse,"This story, in it's own age, was probably nothing more than a startling look into a future of a planet that we could not yet reach. A look at an age filled with space travel, and strange creatures of a different race. But today, it's just another science fiction novel on a row filled with classics, sitting next to 2001, and A Brave New World. But, apon reading it you discover more to it than that, you see a philosophy, and thought that most could not have reached. Apon reaching the end of the book, you find a startling paradox that is worthy of a Japanese Proverb. In my own opinion, My favorite story was ""Usher II"", but then again, my least favorite was ""Way In The Middle Of The Air"" so I guess you could say I was evenly distributed. But over all, I say it is worthy of it's classic status, and should continue to be read by students al over the world."
5,Perfect....,"CRT has really done the impossible....they have brought the complete table of contents of the book to life, and maintained faithfulness to the stories (it's not really a novel) and to Bradbury's poetic prose, and that is no mean feat. It's spread over 6 discs and runs nearly six hours. Jerry Robbins and the CRT have numerous productions under their belt and are the most prolific of production companies in the genre of ""theater of the ear"". Give them a try, you won't be sorry."
3,Kinda boring,"The book Martian Chronicles was an alright book but kinda boring. Some parts of the book got a little exciting or some what humorous. Some of the stories like Silent Towns, Way in the middle of the air, or Usher II or the the exciting ones or humorous ones but the others I found boring. I never really found any of the stories too boring to where I fell asleep reading them, but I found some of them not to exciting."
2,Pretty when it's paused!,"The visual style of this film is very striking and interesting, but the animation is unnatural at best and the story plods along like a 100-year-old donkey. It feels like a 19th-century fairy tale translated to the screen, word by antiquated word, with no regard for the very different medium that film is. I shall add this to my stack of films to watch on mute."
4,Last Strands,"I really don't know about Strand because he is so uneven. When he is good, he is great and engages us in the world we know. There are a few of Strand's poems that will stand in future anthologies the test of time, at least into the into the short or middle distance."
5,A superb Christie title,"This is one of Agatha Christie's most ingenious and classic murder mysteries. The confidence trick she wields in this book is both startling and imaginative, and only a very experienced Christie reader would have any suspicion of what the authoress is up to. A very enjoyable, lively Christie book, and one which surely belongs among her finest."
4,Who done it?,"I enjoyed this book, but didn't really want to read it. One of my friends recommended it to me. It is a mystery that is well written but I've read better. It is a little hard to figure out what Christie is trying to say in the French phrases. I don't know very many words in French so if you don't know any words of French or don't have a friend that does I suggest you shouldn't read this book."
3,not one of my favorites but STILL worth reading,"I love Agatha Christie's books and think they are all worth reading. It's very difficult to even come up with my top 10, but I can say this one is not in contention...the story itself was terrific and captivating (I want to go on vacation to these places), but the ending had pieces that weren't tied into the story as well as she normally pulls it off. With that said, it's a great read."
4,A good night's read,"Wonderfully written and constantly on the move so that you never want to set it down! I haven't read a Hercule Poirot book before, and this seems to be a later one, still I felt no problem picking up on his eccentricities and persona. The book is fairly short and so intriguing that I found I had finished it much sooner that I hoped!The plot is full of twists so that I never saw the ending in its entirety until the final chapter, but I never felt like the book relied on absurd jumps to hide the solution.Also, the book was written a while ago, and the language and style reflect that. Some stock scenes are used and cliches are bandied about (like the climatic scene!) but I found this more charming then worn out!"
4,One of the Better Christies,"Following in the wake of Roger Ackroyd, this is one of the better Poirot mysteries. Can Poirot prevent attempted murder from succeeding? A lot of questions and conflicting detail give way to clarity as Poirot applies order and method to the confusion. Several crimes intertwine, but like a good dog, Poirot stays on the scent to the surprising end."
4,Peril at End House,really well thought out thriller with a good twist at the end. I always like Poirot. All the Poirot books stand the test of time
4,A great twist makes it memorable,"It's fun to try to figure out who the killer is in Christie's mysteries. She generally plays fair and there is a satisfaction in following the clues to an end. This one tricked me and that made it fun. Poirot also heads in the wrong direction so at least I was not alone. A number of attempts are made on a young woman's life, leading Poirot to investigate and do his best to save her. A number of twists and turns and a few suspicious characters made this a very satisfying addition to the series."
2,yuck,"I haven't tried any others to compare, but I am having trouble consuming this product so I can't review if it good for the health or not. The taste is very strong."
2,"Not the best, but you get what you pay for","I bought this at a local Sporting Goods store for $150 because of the price and brought it to the range. I could range the 50, 100 and 150 signs. I was able to range the 181 yard flag...once only. And the bright yellow 200 yard sign....forget it. I tried until the battery was dying, balanced it against a board and still couldn't hit it. Forget all the other pins. I was able to return it and am waiting for a Nikon with it's First Priority program to go on sale. Maybe good for other uses, but not golf."
3,Steady as you are Rangefinder,"I bought the rangefinder to measure out driving range's flag distances. Some of the distance are questionable because when I shoot a flag, it gives out 20 yards more then what it posted at the driving range. When shooting at a yardage sign (which is a bigger target) the yardage is similar to the posted yardage (maybe 1-3 yards difference). Also at night, it's very hard or impossible to get a reading unless the object you're shooting is white.Con: Flimsy, almost toy type construction. Not so good in dim lighting. Need to have a big target and steady hands to operate it correctly. May need to measure different targets to ensure you're getting the correct distance.Pro: Light weight if you're carrying it on your waist belt and walking 18 holes. No annual membership to pay for. Great value for the price. Good tool for a beginner golfer to practice his yardage."
1,Not a golf distance finder,"This item was returned for credit. It simply does not work outside of about 100 yards. Beyond 100 yards or so, when the flag was in front of any other target (i.e. trees, etc.) it would only register the farther away target. When only the flag was visible, it would not register the distance at all."
4,I'm a Golfer. Works Well Inside 150 Yards,"Used this unit multiple times and if you're 100 - 150 yards of the pin, it works well. Outside 150 yards, it seems to have problems picking up the flags. I can 'shoot' the fromt of the greens to get that yardage. I think it's a good deal for the price. $149.00)."
1,Piss Poor Lack Of Motivation Will Bring Such A Poor CD,"I really just couldnt believe it when I first heard that someone was making a cd called *Tribute to Avril Lavigne*. Since I didnt have an account on Amazon Ive decided to beg countless hours to use my friends account.Im going to make this short and sweet and cut all the crap out. I truly wonder what the band was thinking when they said * Hey Lets put out a cd thats a trubute to Avril Lavigne*Ive heard more coherently put together vocal abilities from a 12 year old child.I dont want to sound like Im *dogging her* but If I wanted to listen to Avril Lavigne then I would probably buy the cd called *Lets go by Avril Lavigne *.I would suggest for this chick to be herself and write her own lyrics and I *MAY* decide to listen to her.Im a guy, and I know no one is perfect in this world and I for one hate writing essays since I suck so much at it, but this must really stop.What has this world come to?"
1,DON'T BUY,"This thing has got nothing to do with Avril Lavigne,it's only made to make easy $$$ (ab)using Avril's succes.If you like Avril, then just buy ""Let go"" (4 1/2 stars, good album), if you don't like her,you shouldn't even be on this page :)"
1,GOOD LORD,"This is seriously the most terrible thing I have ever seen. Popular music as we know it is dying a painful, irritating, and extremely extruciating death."
1,Just can't believe it...,"I'm not a huge fan of Avril Lavigne, but I like to hear her songs. Since I don't own this CD, I just couldn't believe when I heard the samples of the musics on it! It awful, horrible!!!I just can give this advice to the fans of Avril: buy her own albums or just leave it, because buying this one it's just a waste of money!"
1,Oh wow.......,Can you say AWFUL? This band could have some serious potential if they stopped covering Avril's tunes. And the lead singer could have talent if she stopped trying to sound like Avril.(background vocals were good though) Just do me a favor and save your ten bucks and buy some real music! None of this poser stuff! Okay? I mean listen to some real music like the RAMONES or AFI! Or why not actually buy AVRIL lAVIGNES CD? I mean they are her songs.
1,Two Thumbs WAY Down,Avril ROCKS!!!! The person singing does not sound like Avril one bit. I sing better then that. It would be TOTALLY better if someone who could sing was in the album. It stunk!!!!!!!!
1,A Discrace To Avril Lavigne,"Dont call this cd a tribute, call it a discrace. This band is a hoax, and a joke. Dont waist your money on this cd, dont waist your time listening to it. You might as well buy a karaokee machine and record your voice to Avrils songs because trust me... you sound better. I hope Avril never hears this awful cd."
5,Extremely Satisfied with product,I am glad I have purchased this book it has been very helpful.Very happy with product and shipping was fast and accurate. It was a pleasure doing business with you and I look forward to purchasing more.Thanks and I will recommend this site to friends and family.Thank youMillie Cook
2,Tips for Enjoying Paris,"I bought this book with high hopes and found it enjoyable. The writing is fun and whets your appetite for your trip to France.However, just about every chapter in the book is specifically geared toward Paris. There are all kinds of wonderful tips about place to go and things to see - in Paris. I'm not going to Paris.Perhaps Ms. Platt's tips on behavior are probably applicable all over France, but perhaps not. I mean, do you go about things in the same way in Seattle as you do in New York? In a book subtitled ""211 Tips for Enjoying France and the French"", I expected more information about the rest of the country.Change the subtitle to ""211 Tips for Enjoying Paris and the Parisians"" and I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Great gadget but battery guzzler,"I purchased this particular Park Zone product for my daughter who lives in an apartment and has her own garage. It works beautifully. Unfortunately, she is having to replace the batteries every 3-4 months which I feel is not cost-efficient. I now wish I had bought the higher model that can be plugged into an outlet. Was it not for the battery issue, I would have given it at least 4 stars."
4,Nice Accessory,"Does what it's supposed to do, well made, and includes useful drill bit holder. Good value."
4,Drill Holister,This is just what I have been looking for in finding some way of holding my cordless drill. This holder is perfect for my use.
4,Happy with it.,"Considering that I only paid $30 for it at a thrift shop, I was really pleased. I can't imagine why someone got rid of it. Maybe they got tired of juicing or just bought another model. I was pleasantly surprised how good fresh juiced veggies taste as I have trouble getting enough veggies in my diet. I did experience some heavy duty off balance vibration but now just shut it down when it's just starting to vibrate and scoop out some of the pulp and restart. This does take some time though as the machine takes awhile to slow down and stop. It's not too hard to clean but a little time consuming. Instead of throwing away the pulp, I've been drying it to later crumble into soups and stews(I already had my dehydrator out to dry seasonal fruit). I had not considered juicing in the past (I often make veggie smoothies in my blender) and now I would probably spend the money on this model or a better one should my thrift store special break down."
1,Blew up after only a few uses,Very dissapointed in this juicer and would not recommend it. It died after only a few uses and was remarkably slow and powerless before it died. Terrible for juicing greens. I'm shopping for a replacment and am looking at a Greenstar or a Breville.
3,Get out the magnifying glass,"It was an inexpensive book and I got what I paid for. Overall, it is just okay.The song selection is very good. The arrangements are mediocre at best; but they allow for easy simplification or embellishment (depending on skill levels). The skill level required varies so that players of most any level will find something they can play with a little effort.My biggest issue is that the TAB is mostly illegible, at least in the copy that I received. The fret numbers in the TAB are so small and jammed together that it is impossible to read most of it.My suggestion is to re-transcribe the songs you want to work on using a computer so that you can print out TAB that can be read easily. The chords are the most difficult to read; but you can make them out well enough to figure out the chord voicing/fingering (very slowly...) and then write it out so you can read it easily. The chords are mostly open chords using the most common voicings."
5,The best children's story Bible I've yet to see,"This book is wonderfully written in a manner as if a grandmother were telling these Bible stories to her children (that is actually how the book came to be written). It is not watered down Bible stories but they are portrayed as the exciting, dramatic events they were. Customs and doctrines (reformed) are explained right in the story line. Although it is not the complete Bible, it contains all the narrative and historical passages of the Bible. It is divided into chapters which may cover several Bible chapters (it may mix books of the Bible as it tries to tell the story of the nation of Israel chronilogically). The Child's Story Bible contains 110 chapters of old testament stories and 92 of new testament stories. It is a wonderful devotional guide for the family as it is easy for young children to understand yet not too simplistic for older children. Our family loves it and has learned a lot from it!!"
5,the best bible story book ever,"I have been a sunday school teacher for over 20 years. I have 3 children(8-11). This book is the best bible story book I have ever read for children that are 6 and older. The book doesn't have a lot of pictures but the text is incredible. Is so true to the bible and so doctrinally correct. I love it. Many children stories are so off and don't mach the real Bible . Their message is confusing . This book gives a bit of background coverage so the children understand the times of the bible , the culture of the people that live in bible times so the children can connect the story. This way they can understand the message of the passage. It is amazing. I love it. It can also be used as teaching material in a sunday school class. Also can be used to introduce someone to the bible . It is very simple and the language is very simple. Anyone can understand it. I highly recommend it"
5,The Child's Story Bible,I use this book in children's bible study. It is great and easy for them to understand. I recommend this book to other teachers and parents.
2,"Hardly any pictures, not a good Bible for a child who still enjoys picture books","We have many children's Bibles and I purchased this one for my 3 year old because of the excellent reviews. Unfortunately, it has hardly any pictures in it at all so we have not enjoyed it as I thought we would. I would not recommend this Bible to anyone looking to read it to a child who likes to look at pictures to help captivate their attention. Perhaps when he is older it will be put to better use."
4,Good picture and company,"I originally received a defective, very, very, very poorly packaged poster. I didn't realize it until my guarantee ran up. Well, I e-mailed the company (365 inc.) and they immediately sent me instructions on sending it back. Unfortunately, they just took the posters back and refunded my money, so I had to re-order them.Whatever! It worked out. I ordered them again and received very nice posters. I framed this one and put it in my office. It's AWESOME! If you can find cheap frames, this makes a great gift!"
4,Reminds me of Foo Fighters,"Listen to the melodies,the drumming, the way the music is written,sure sounds alot like Foo Fighters and thats a good thing. I'm glad J Mascis has started writting again,started penning some nice rockin bouncy tunes with of course his signature guitar solo's."
3,Sizing Chart for Men is Wrong.,"This is the fault of Warmbat's inaccurate unisex sizing chart which in standard shoe manufacturing terms should reflect a 2 size difference between men's and women's sizes, not just a 1 size difference. For example, a 10 men/11 women is actually a size 9 men/11 women. Therefore men should order one size larger than they normally do. Other than that it is fairly nice boot. I gave the boots one star less than I normally would have because of the hassle of having to exchange them for a larger size."
1,Chinese junk,"Typical chinese fit, too wide in heels, too narrow in toe. In spite of warmbat australia logos all over, the little tag deep inside says made in China. At least one size too small, returned for refund"
4,Lots of CAT-itude Here,"In CATWALK, Kathie Freeman's descriptive prose has the reader pulling for Tiger, a much-traveled and plucky cat in this picaresque tale of one cat's struggle for survival. As Tiger is caught up in the uncertainties of life, Freeman paints a graphic picture of the precarious life of too many of our feline companions who find themselves either lost or abandoned. Fortunately, Tiger has the inner strength and good fortune to make it on her own, and CATWALK comes to a happy and unexpected conclusion.~Victor DiGenti, author of Windrusher and the Trail of Fire"
2,Not yellow but golden,"This product is not what i expected... Description says ""yellow"" star but they are nothin but a golden oem color replacement bulb... It was a waste of my money.."
3,"Very detailed commentary, but has its weaknesses","You won't find a more comprehensive commentary on Philemon. The authors go into (sometimes) excruciating detail and depth, making it difficult to keep up with their arguments sometimes. They tend to belittle any interpretation that does not line up wit theirs. Not as strong on lexical issues as other critical commentaries."
5,Best intro to Zone System I've seen,"Absolutly easy to understand and read. Very well presented, and may well be the only book on Zone System you will ever need. For those wanting to delve into the chemistry of exposure, pass on this book. If you want to learn what the Zone system is and how it works, this book is great. ""Everything you need, nothin' you don't"""
2,More like PermaOutOfFocus,"I guess I should have read the fine print more carefully. These binoculars have no focusing ability whatsoever. To be fair, they are (somewhat) in focus at considerable distance to infinity, but I can't adjust them to my particular vision (so they're never exactly in focus for me at any distance), and they're of no use at closer distances. I should have bought the Nikon version."
3,The Wednesday Witch,"Do you like witches? If you do you'll like the book called The Wednesday Witch by Ruth Chew. I chose this book because every time I read the back of the book I'm interested in the book.In the book it tells you how witches get from place to place. It's a good book. The witch goes out on Wednesday. I can't tell you where the witch goes out every Wednesday. You have to read the book if you want to find out. Please don't read this book to a child under three years old because he can get nightmares about witches.I recommend this book if you like witches. Trust me, it's a really good book."
5,I loved this book !,This was the fastest book I ever read! I couldn't wait to finish it once I started it. I wish it was on the 4th grade reading list - it was so good! If you are looking for a good book you should try reading this book. I loved it so much!!!!! My Aunt read it 34 years ago when she was in the 4th grade and then she passed it on to me.written by Shelby Johnson
5,Very good,"I own this recording in LP in was very happy to get it on cd.The performers are top notch. The conducting is excellent.BTW, Rienzi is (unfortunately) known mostly for its popular overture.I have listened to many recordings of the overture, mostly they are taken out of context and the result is a fanfare that can be played right after Shostakovich' Festive Overture...Nontheless, I mention the overture because it is simply outstanding in this release. The only other recording (of the overture) that comes close is of George Szell with the Cleveland Orchestra.Highly recommended."
3,"Ignore my rating, I havn't listened to this recording","I just wanted to shed some light on this work which Wagner later declared a sin of his youth. The reason the pieces is always cut is not necessarily because it is so long (God knows, he wrote other long operas) but because most of what is cut is simply repeats. These repeats interrupt the flow of the drama, something that the mature Wagner despised. He wrote this opera for one reason alone, to achieve recognition in French opera houses; therefore, it is written in the French grand opera style, which means it is full of superfluities of every sort. Nothing about this opera is ""authentic Wagner,"" but rather his filling out pre-disposed formulas for success. This is why in the 130 years it has been standing, the Bayreuth festival has never once performed this, or his other two early operas. Yes, there is some interesting, even possibly wonderful music in this opera, but it does not fulfill Wagner's ideals of the genre."
4,Accurate and good range finder but requires steady hands,"I bought this rangefinder after reading many reviews on a few models. They were running a $50 rebate so that weighs in to my decision as well. This rangefinder is easy to use and accurate, but you need steady hands otherwise, it will misread the landscape. I would rate it at 3.75 stars and a buy."
5,Great book!,This book is a must to have if you have little ones in your house. Very interesting and powerful encourage to make healthy changes in your daily diet and with that put your family in a better place of health and happiness!
1,"If you have a nut allergy, don't bother getting this book.","I bought this book with great anticipation, and I was SORELY disappointed. One of my children has a severe (life-threatening) nut allergy, and most of the recipes/meal plans are filled with nuts. Since the author uses nuts as a main source of protein and doesn't offer nut-free alternatives, this book was basically useless to me."
1,Avoid this book if your child has food allergies,I was very excited about this book after reading all of the wonderful reviews. A large number of the healthy recipes that are recommended have nuts. The author continues to recomend nuts and nut oils and nut butters over and over again to the point where I just want to stop reading because I CAN'T use that. I really wish he would provide at least a section of the book giving sugggestions on how to modify the diet he recommends for those who can't use nuts. At this point my purchase was a waste of $.
1,BORING,The information is good but the authors writing style is terrible. He repeats the same thing over and over in what seems to be in an attempt to make the book longer. This book could have been half the size it is if he didn't repeat himself. It also makes you feel as if you are screwed being the adult if you didn't eat perfectly your whole life. Wouldn't recommend this book.
4,Great but not today's PG!,I too watched this growing up and loved it. I had horses so REALLY loved it. Couldn't wait to show it to our kids. But forgot all about the bad language in it!! Just wanted to warn anyone thinking it would be without.
2,Casey's Shadow,"Being a horsewoman, this was recommended to me. Story content is good, but language keeps us from letting the children view this again."
3,ok.....,"this is an ok toy but the rabbit has no action of it's own. the shaft is pretty nice, but for something that looks like a dual action, it's definately not one."
1,Not ready for prime time,I bought this from Amazon in April 2007. Just as the other reviews state the unit worked about a month. Amazon sent me a replacement in June and that unit worked until July. The fan and lights worked so you don't realize it's not working until you realize there is no dust on the collection plates.
4,pretty good,"Its a great game.. it gives you the adventure of a double agent.. to choose what side to help at certain times when it may or may not matter.. but i believe the story line changes very little if you side one way or the other.. if you go too rogue then you have less equipment to do the next mission with and if you go to far one side or the other.. you have to do a quick easy mission to level there suspicion and then everything is ok. and both sides trust you eaqually again.. so you can kill 2000 people if you like.. and then rust to a pc to say ""oops, i had to do it for the mission"" and then you not bad. lol but it still a lot of fun even with that.. cause you feel as if your in control.. and it gives you diffrent routes to take to complete the same mission. over all im glad i played it!"
1,"Over-priced by worth, dissatisfactory by use!","As a note, the seller is reliable, efficient, and responsive. Hopefully this review is to some benefit.Judging according to the quality and works of the item, undoubtedly awful. Item does not work properly, according to its purpose. Item has either factory defects or poor quality manufacturing. Immpossible to read pressure without resulting in a flat tire! Openly, would never recommend.PROS:-has good size with grip-has replacable battery option-it's digital (although pointless; ineffective)CONS:-no seal, lets plenty air out-no prompt, final read clears instantly-cheap material, bad qualityTotal loss: $20"
2,Just OK,"This is not a very good version of the accutire product...to large and clunky, and the guage faces away from you as you place it on the tire. I don't recommend it."
5,All religion is bunk.,"My only complaint: Let's just take it a step further and say ""The Counterfeit Religion of Christianity"". All of Christiandom (and Islam and Buddhism and every other ""other worldly"" religion had the same formative processes that created Mormonism, only so long ago no one seems to muster the critical scope to take it on."
5,installation clues,Easiest method to remove cable from switch is to insert small screw driver where cable inserts into switch at the small notch and turn screw driver.
1,Switches are reversed,"The site says this will fit my 2002 Explorer Sport Trac, but on my vehicle the switches are reversed with the on/off on the left!"
5,SW5928 cruise control switch replacement,I have the official Ford manual which called for removing the steering wheel along with a lot of other stuff. I found that the switch's were exactly as advertised on Amazon and the install was extremely easy. Absolutely no problems or concerns and the price was excellent.
4,Impulse buy,"Though I tend to shy away from ""books"", I had a burning desire to own this one. So being the impulsive youth, I am, I hit the order button. Do I regret it? No! I laughed my arse off. I guess now, I'll put it on a shelf and read it when bored, or sick or something. Yep."
3,Fatcat poker top,Not bad for the price.Does have a nice heavy wood backing but some of the stiching could use some help.
2,Bad Product,Another model of the Bushnell Perma Focus binocular was bought in Dec. 2011. Was only used at home court basketball games and broke in half by end of season. Sent product back only to be told it was defective but was not covered under warranty.
2,"Beware of ""hidden costs""","I don't have any big problem with its technical specs. My Pro Tour XL works, but its design is flawed. Because its power button is bumped and very sensitive, the device can get powered on very easily in the maker-supplied carrying case. You notice every time you simply put it back in the carrying case, the device turns on. I'm sure that it gets on whenver I grab it or it's packed with other stuff in a golf bag. As a result, battery drain is significant. One battery lasted only two months for just a few rounds of play. At this rate, costs of batteries can quickly surpass the price of this device!"
4,Well worth the price,"A set of 3 pans for less than you'd pay for one. Even heating, nice nonstick surface, easy to clean. Only downside is that the handles do get quite warm-keep out of reach of little ones!"
3,Cheap pans,I liked it at first but within the year there was a chip and it warped. So I had to toss it . Probably better to get a higher quality one.Pans are light.Non stick worked well at firstThin coatingWarped and chipped after first yearHeating was not that even
2,not so non-stick,"3 pieces of cookware for the price of $12.99, how can I pass on such a good deal? But after I used the pans, I wasn't sure it's such a great deal anymore because they are not as non-sticy and durable as I thought. The pans are light-weight so they are easy to handle. But after my first use to cook a steak, the pan was burned and I had to scrub for 20 minutes to clean it up. I was not happy but not totally upset since I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it."
3,Light And Useful,"This little set of small non-stick pans is a nice buy from Amazon. The small frying pans are fine for quick use. The grill pan is a little small, but workable. The handles are metal and the pans can go into the oven, but not over 350 degrees F. For light pans, the non-stick surfaces are fairly tough, but hand wash only.Recommended"
4,Good not great!,"The product is sturdy though not very elegant.I did not like the finish. Not of a typical ""Faberware"" type. The griddle is large while the pans are quite small. But defnitely worth the price"
4,Much smaller than expected,"The measurement states 15 inches, but this doll is no way 15 inches. Perhaps if you measure from the tip of her hair (not head) and stretch her legs out, then she might be 15 inches but if you measure from tip of head to legs, the doll is only 12 inches. It's a good size for a toddler but probably too small for older kids. Also, the beige doll is much darker than what's shown on Amazon photos. What I do like about this doll is that she is washable and does not contain any fire retardants!!"
4,Cute and Cuddly,"This doll was a gift for my one year old granddaughter. It was a hit! She took it out of the gift bag and immediately wanted to hold it. It is so-o-o soft! I was completely satisfied with it and so was my granddaughter. i do think that it's probably appropriate for one, two, and maybe three year olds. Any older, and they'll probably get bored."
5,Daughter LOVES this doll,"Seriously-- my 19 month old daughter could not love this doll more, she sleeps with her every night and she comforts her in her crib. This doll is the perfect size and feels very soft. I would definitely recommend getting this dollie!"
4,"nice doll, but beige = black not tan or beige which you would think","I bought this doll for the little girl I watch. She has dark hair and eyes, so I picked this one instead of the blue eyed blonde baby doll. The description listed this doll as beige. It is clearly the black doll. I am fine with a black doll, so it should be listed at that instead of beige.The doll itself is cute and soft."
5,cute,bought this for granddaughter. she is in love with it. plays with it all day long and takes it to bed with her.
5,Baby Stella,Baby Stella is so cute; the perfect doll for my 20 month old granddaughter. She is easy to carry around and is soft and huggable.It seems to ba a well made toy.
3,My daughter does not like it,"I bought it when my daughter was about 11 month old, based on all the good reviews. She barely touched the doll and now she is 13 and half month old and still won't even look at the doll. Instead, she was fascinated with a $5 plastic little doll I randomly picked up at Target. I think this doll is not ""real"" enough for her to take interest in it. Probably when she is older, she may be more interested in it, but I won't count on it.Update, now that she is 21 months old, she still never play with it for more than half a minute. She is not interested in it."
4,Great first baby doll,"Baby Stella it's a great first baby! She is well made! This baby is our second baby Stella doll, we also have the one with no hair!! My daughter just loves these dolls"
5,Adorable doll!!,"Adorable doll...soft and perfect for one year old. do not know if she will like dolls yet, but this one is so soft, she seems to like to cuddle with it."
5,My Grandaughter loves her!,Soft and sweet! Just right for a little one under one.Washable and lovable.Good quality that will be loved for a long time.
5,best first baby doll,I bought this doll for my 8 month old for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. The doll is soo soft. My daughter's favorite part of the doll is the pacifier. She pulls it off and on all day. I would highly recommend this doll to anyone looking for a soft and well made doll.
2,"Seems nice, but not so great","This gauge seemed to be accurate and well built. Worked very well for about a year. Then the seal that mates with the valve stem became loose and distorted. After that, the gauge went in the trash."
3,Gauges Stuck,"At first used the gauges gaves a reading, after waiting until the gauges says 00, and use it again on the next tire, the reading stucks to 00. I am kind of disappointed."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I've used it quite a few times and agree with the reviewers that said it was difficult to get a good seal. In addition, this morning while trying to open the case, which is not particularly easy, the gauge popped out and dropped about 2 ft. After that, the backlit LCD screen did not work, making it very difficult to read."
3,Could be better,"Gauge is easy to read under most lighting conditions. When I compared readings with my old pencil type gauge the values are comparable. I have no other way to determine accuracy. Repeatability is good, although here is where I found the biggest flaw: As mentioned by several other reviewers, I too found it difficult to get a good seal between the gauge and the valve stem of the tire. Despite my best efforts to position the gauge properly, very often I would be greeted by the sound of air escaping from the valve/gauge junction. My $1.98 pencil gauge is easier to use and has a better actuator for bleeding excess air out of the tire."
1,Impossible to maintain a seal on some valve stems,I had an older Accutire that did not work well on my new car. I figured it was worn out and ordered this Gauge. It doesn't work either. It is impossible to maintain a good seal between the valve and the gauge. Instead of investing in fancy backlight etc. Accutire would have done much better by using a high quality sealing mechanism and not that flimiscal plastic/rubber combination. Using a different Gauge with a solid brass/metal connector I have no trouble at all. In short: I do not recommend.
1,Simple is better,Being a mechanic I should have known better. This tire gage is not only the worst tire gage I have ever bought but it is the worst tool I had ever bought. After the third use it leaked to the point where I had to reinflate my tires and recheck them with a simple yet always reliable analog gage. Not only that but I compared the accuracy with a calibrated gage from my shop and found the accutire gage was up to 5 psi off. Take some advice from a mechanic/sucker the simpler the better.
4,Great Starting Point,"I seached out this book when I was tasked to be part of creation of a review process for my smallish company. ""Abolishing Performance Appraisals"" operated as a great resource during the process.Especially helpful were the case studies, which pointed out how real companies were creating alternatives to clunky performance appraisals."
1,This is a total waste of paper . . .,"Having no prior experience with Linux I bought the book, mistakenly, thinking that it would simplify the process of installing and setting it up. I was severely mistaken. It provides no concrete guidance and no clear direction. Good luck understanding setting up disk partitions and what you do with error messages during the installation process. It makes references to answers that are never given.Really do not waste your time and money on this book. It doesn't even warrant one star."
1,You have GOT to be kidding me...,"Do yourself a favor and obtain an MP3 somewhere before blindly purchasing this. UGH. Innane and impractical applications of musical elements--completely unlistenable, except to cause others to fret for your sanity. I wouldn't have wasted my time even reviewing this garbage, but people like me see terms thrown about like ""highly technical"" and ""interesting time signatures"" and such in other reviews, and a picture is developed of a finely tuned musical machine. What ISN'T said is that the machine is malfunctioning horribly, and that you hve to be one of the handful of people on the planet who fully understand chaos theory to even ""appreciate"" this so called ""mathmatical"" preversion of metal."
1,and the big deal is...?,"I don't understand dillinger escape plan. They're noise. Flat out f***ing noise. All they do is pound on their respective instruments and scream incoherent crap. I'm sorry, but there is no depth here. If you want depth in some good metalcore, get lamb of god, bleeding through, as I lay dying, or Unearth. Hell, get the freaking backstreat boys for all I care, but I loathe the fact that this band has such a cult following when all they are is senseless noise that shames the name of metal everywhere."
5,Permafocus is Miraculous!,"I actually have a less powerful binocular than this one, but it is the Bushnell Permafocus technology. I can't even begin to describe how amazing it is to never have to focus your binoculars. You just look through, and whatever you're looking at, regardless of distance (except very close-up), is in focus! It's like a camera auto-zoom. My husband wears glasses with a rather strong prescription, and he can see perfectly clearly through these binoculars without his glasses. He just takes them off, and it's as if he never wears them!"
4,"Convenient in focus but large, heavy","If you want to catch something in the binoculars quickly without fooling around trying to focus... this is it. We live on a lake and we always have something in the wild to catch our eye. This has been very beneficial to have the focus there at all times. They are a bit bulky and somewhat heavy but an excellent pair of binoculars. The ""shake"" with the power is not bad like we thought it would be. I can not say enough about Bushnell as a company. They support and back their products like I have never seen in ANY other company. I will ALWAYS buy this brand from now on because of this."
2,20x20 vision,"I suppose this is a good product if you have 20x20 vision. I could have overlooked it, but I don't recall seeing this mentioned. Unfortunately I don't have 20x20 vision and everything had a uniformly blurry look.They might be good for you, but they weren't for me."
5,BPF 12X,"Works the way you expect them to work, which is not true with all binoculars: Good magnification, clear view, in focus, and not necessary to tinker with a bunch of adjustments to get the perfect match for every different user. Not compact, but I didn't expect them to be."
4,Fish Scale-4 Stars,Love this fish scale! Decent price and works great! VERY durable and easy to read #'s!
3,Stock up on CR2032 batteries...,"Yes, it's inexpensive and accurate, but the batteries don't last long.Even during periods of non-use, the batteries seem to drain.I blame the designer for using CR2032 batteries (typically $3-$10 each), vs., for example, AA batteries, which cost about 50 cents in small quantities. AA batteries typically have 10 times the life of CR2032s. (CR2032s usually are rated around 220 mAh, while alkaline AAs are often over 2500 mAh.)So it's a nice scale, but don't leave it in your tackle box for a few months and expect it to work. Keep some extra CR2032s handy."
2,A little disappointed,"This guy is supposed to the master of sells psychology and while I did find some useful info, it was often time repetitive and really elementary. I don't consider myself a star salesperson with years of experience but I do pretty well considering I just started doing it 6 months ago. I was hoping to up my game and I'm not sure I have learned much more then I already knew."
2,"Good CD, BAD DVD - I paid to watch adverts?","The DVD included with this item is just boring blatant advertising. You just watch PBW walk in and out of each shop doing mundane things and asking pointless questions to the owners/staff; but not before he makes sure you know the name of the shop and its website and street address etc.The CD on the other hand is quite good. There were no tracks which I disliked. A great assorment of tracks from Jazz, Regae, Hip-Hop, Funk and Blues, the last track escpecially by the Freestyle Fellowship is sweet as.I would recommend buying the soundtrack, but steer clear of the DVD unless you want to watch 60 mins of advertisments."
2,"Not my bag, a bit to religious.","Not a bad book if you are a super religious person. I was hoping for a bit more of a how to book than a guide in becoming a good rabbi or preacher. For the in depth religious person, up to and including the professional, this would be a good book. But just not my thing. I am a religious person but prefer not to be a preacher."
3,REVIEW,I only flipped through this publication so far --- but much of it seems to have been made obsolete by Internet Genealogy tools.
4,Improved valve,"I have the manual Philip Avent ISIS. Two years ago, the valves were flat. I always had trouble with those valves as they would get loose after repeated use and sterilization. I did not mind having to replace them, but I could not find replacements anywhere. I managed to successfully complete a years worth of pumping with 3 valves. Now I am once again pumping. I started a massive search looking for valves. The new valves continued popping up on my searches and never the old ones. I bought them being very skeptical of their effectiveness. After the first use, I can say with pleasure that these are much better than the old valves. They don't fall out while pumping and can easily be seen in the sterilizer (so they don't disappear). Since the old valves are no longer available, you can rest assured that these will get the job done."
5,Buy This!,This pillow is incredible. I got it for my boyfriend because he was having neck pain when he woke up in the mornings. The neck pain is gone and he sleeps like a baby. It's great!
4,It is very good,"I have slept on such a pillow for nearly 1 year and I am quite satisfied with it. It does provide excellent support although I find it difficult to sleep face-down. Overall, it is a very good purchase and is one of the best pillows I have used. Recommended."
2,Breaks easily,"This is my second one. The first one took a lot of abuse at shows where there was wind that wanted to blow displays over. This one fell once and broke in a number of places. I wouldn't call that abuse, but the advertisers call it sturdy. Not my experience."
4,awsome binocs,for the price these binocs are awesome.i love them. the only reason i gave them a four is because the lens covers fall off. but fore the price and quality of them who cares.buy these especially if you are on a budget
4,Bad Cat Razzle-Dazzles,"When I started reading my 2-year old son a nightly bedtime story, we read a different book nearly every night. Now, we read Bad Cat Puts on His Top Hat every night. I thought the story was a little disorganized, but my son loves the occasional rhymes and the bright artwork, especially the first picture, a detailed panorama we love to look at closely to find all the planes, dogs, cats, squirrels, etc. Now my son is almost 3, and we've taken to counting all the cupcakes we see. I think he'll always remember this book!"
3,Decent but disappointing,"I'm a fan of WWII Naval history, and I bought a copy of this book at a reduced price--about 10 bucks. I'm glad I paid no more than that. Some of the pictures are compelling, but overall, the book is a very cursory look at a pretty sizeable topic. It might make for a good coffee table book, but there aren't enough pictures. It's certainly not a detailed history--more information on any of the sinkings listed can easily be found on any of a dozen general websites. The war in the Pacific gets half as many pages as the sinking of the Kursk? There seems to be a lack of effort/research on the author's part toward anything comprehensive, or to really put together a definitive pictoral history. What you get is a smattering of both, which is, after reading this from cover to cover in less than an hour and a half, unsatisfying."
2,Boring and fake,"I am a fan of Los Straitjackets, and love the Pontani Sisters. Somehow they managed to make a fantastic band into something very blah. This sounds like the music played by a fake band in a movie. Just boring, going through the motions, spiritless music. It is mixed awfully and all you hear is George singing. This record is no fun. The DVD is pretty amusing. The cameraman obviously liked Angie's breasts!"
2,Rough edition,"I am not sure if there was a translation error, bad print run, etc... but watch out for typos and other errors in this book. Learning a new game becomes even more challenging when the diagrams do not match up and the text is wrong."
1,Hard to read and full of errors,It boggles the mind how a book publisher can put out a book with so many typos and mistakes. Since the author's name looks German maybe the problem was in the translation process. After struggling with this book for a week I went back and purchased Jennifer A. Kelley's Great Book of Domino Games... what a difference. My advice is don't waste your time or money on Muller's book. Buy Kelley's book (her book is a pleasure to read).
2,As basic a book as eluded to in the title! Only 2/5ths good.,"I was quite intrigued by the title of this book as I am sure most folks are who are interested and buy books on domino. I have seen this book often sold with a big set of dominoes included with the package elsewhere - but that hardly makes up for the book which has too many gross errors. At one point in reading about one game description and rules I became hopelessly lost and couldn't really understand much! Its just another book. I finally got the book ""Dominoes Plus: The Dominoforms Handbook"" as my main guide of use myself to replace this one."
1,Say no to lame packaging,"I want all of the plant solo albums remastered. But I am not going to buy this box. Why? Because of the lame package. To be completely honest, I like the jewel box. I even purchased the mighty rearranger from england so that I could get it in a jewel box. However, these expanded versions are coming out on individual cds. At least they are in England, I saw the prerelease listings at amazon uk. So if you want the music and not the lame box. Wait."
4,Cool Dive Movie,"All in all, this is a pretty good movie. Seems like the only gripe is that when Paul Walker free drives he holds his breath for approximately 8 years. However, they do explain in the movie that he is capable of holding his breath for 3 minutes, which is not uncommon among people who spend that much time in the water. Fast paced and entertaining this movie will thrill nearly everyone who watches it. Oh, that and Jessica Alba is easy on the eyes and will tempt you to hit the pause button several times."
1,Very disappointed with this pet bed!!!,"I purchased this pet bed thinking it would be warm and cozy and discovered what a mistake I had made. The bed does not hold its shape, it's like a rag laying on the floor that needs constant adjusting to put it back into postion. The pillow is about 2"" smaller then the center where it sits for the pet to lay on. It is flat with very little padding and no support for an older dog. I am ready to throw it out!!! What a waste of money!!!"
1,Glad I didn't buy this book!,"I've never read Belva Plain before but I recently heard she's a great author and I should try one of her books. I got halfway through this book and can't even stand to finish it. The characters were difficult to keep straight and the writing jumped from present to past, first person to third person. It was weird. Whatever you do, don't buy this book. It's not worth borrowing from the library. Hard to believe she got paid for this."
1,DULL!,"This is a book you read on a cross-country flight simply because there's nothing else. The plot is trite and predictable---you know, for example, the moment Annette's widowed friend is introduced that she will be paired in the end with Annette's widowed son. The characters are flat and one-dimensional, and the dialogue (and the characters' thoughts) follow a formula. Don't waste your time on this one---wait for the ""Movie of the Week"" to be made from it and then switch the channel to something else."
2,More of the same,"I teach in an urban, diverse school teaching both ends of the spectrum, lower/non readers and advanced English students. All of them struggle with the standardized tests. I was looking for more guidance, lists of grade level vocabulary, etc. This book seems to be more of the same, maybe helpful to new teachers. Veterans should already know most of what is in this book.The chapters are short and easy to read and can be used as quick lessons/review. It will be interesting to see if test scores improve after using this book. If so, I will revise my review...until then...luke warm."
3,Good not great film,"As with the 1961 original, this was a good film only for Cruella. I am no fan of Glenn Close, but she was perfect in the part. Disappointed it did not have extras but glad to get it letter box."
2,Falls Short,I found this movie remake to be very dull. I wish they would have at least made the animals talk. Glenn Close was good as all the other actors but this remake strayed too much from the original and too many changes were made. The dogs were the only thing fun to watch.
1,101 dalmatians,I was unable to view video would not play on any of my equipment. Never again waste of money. It did not take too long to come in the mail but a disappointment when it arrived my little one was so excited and it won't play. why is it possible to do
1,Doesn't work in any player in my house!,"I guess my first clue should have been """"available action"""" . DVD troubleshooting is one of the options. Go figure. This DVD doesn't work in any player!! I am planning on sending it back but I wanted to give a review first so that no one else has this problem."
1,very dissatisfied,movie was not able to be played in my area. I sent it back and was NOT reimbursed for postage Either way. I would NEVER order from Amazon again!!!!
1,Doesn't work!,"I ordered this movie for my granddaughter and it wouldn't work in any of their VCR's or on the computer. After contacting Movie Mars I found there were different movies for different locations. If that had been made clear to me I never would have ordered from them. Now, I'm having trouble getting my refund because I can't find how to print my RAF. I'm extremely disappointed."
1,Not impressed with the seller!,We purchased 101 Dalmations that was sold to be in great condition. Christmas gift for my 6 yr. old daughter & we put in movie and it doesn't work. Very frustrated!!
2,No Seller Response,"Due to an ordering error, I received a region 2 (Europe) DVD, which obviously will not play on my U.S. DVD player. I notified the seller of this error, but it has failed to respond at all."
4,Great family fun!,"This movie is great family fun. The ""real"" people put a new spin on the Disney classic. My children loved the original and now claim, ""this one is even better"". Glenn Close is over the top as Cruella!"
5,"FANTASTIC,CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Mickee, You have some DUMB people working for you! Your book was GREAT! Everytime I'm in a book store or online I look for your sequels. Don't let anyone stop you! Keep up the good work!!!!!!"
3,Excellent storyline but unfufilling ending,"The book is very well written but leaves and enmormus cliff hanger. I read the book 1 year after it was published and the second book still has not been released. Books written in a series should not be released so far apart, it leaves disatisfaction with the reader and makes one leery on reading a differnt book by the author for fear of the same unknown."
4,"Good & Comfortable, but a bit ""bulgy""","I have a big noggin and this is one of the few helmets that fit me comfortably and without pressure points (believe me, I've tried ""a few""). Safety-wise, all CPSC certified helmets should be equivalent. Don't be swayed by people saying that a given helmet will protect you more than another; the extra money you pay goes for comfort (fit, better straps and adjustment mechanism, ventilation, weight,) and looks.I'd give it five stars. I docked one star out of the review because it looks somewhat ""mushroomy"" in the head (my previous Gyro helmet, which is not manufactured anymore, was perfect in this aspect.)All in all, it's a good looking and comfortable product and I'll probably buy another before mine ""expires."""
1,Not at all compatible with sony product.,Never ever buy this. Not at all compatible. I got error C 04:00 with this battery which indicates compatibility error.
4,Alky; A play dealing with Alchohol,"This is an excellent play selection for a Junior High drama class. I would reccomend it to drama teachers who are looking for a play with a lot of parts, or who are trying to give a strong message against alchohol. Jerome McDonough does a wonderful job in producing an effective dramatic piece with an awesome selection of characters. A play that will make your audience stop and think."
5,THE HUMOR FOR YOUR HEALTH GUIDEBOOK,"I NEVER REALLY PAID ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MY HUMOR AND HOW IT EFFECTS ME DAILY. I HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS THROUGH DAN'S BOOK. WHAT I ENJOYED ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS THAT IT WAS ABOUT ME. DAN GIVES SUGGESTIONS AND INFORMATION, BUT I GET TO INTERACT AND EXPLORE MY HUMOR BY DOING THE ""EXPERIENCES"" AT THE END OF EACH CHAPTER. I ALSO LIKE THAT I UNDERSTAND SUCH TOPICS AS JOKES, WIT, AND COMEDY NOW. PLUS, THE HARMFUL VS. HEALING CHAPTER BROUGHT UP ALOT FROM GROWING UP IN SCHOOL. I WILL TEACH MY KIDS THIS. THANK YOU FOR HUMOR AWARENESS! I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE THAT WANTS TO REALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH WHAT HUMOR IS ALL ABOUT AND HOW IT REALLY DOES EFFECT US DAILY!"
1,Picture is inaccurate,"In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware!"
3,"Great bra at first, but now I can't even wear it","I loooved this bra at first. Great support, full coverage, made my shirts look very smooth. The only thing I don't like about it is the straps are not adjustable all the way up. There is fabric half way down the strap and I've had the bra about a year and I can't seem to get the straps tight enough and the when I do move it all the way up it works its way down again by itself. In the beginning it was great, but now just a disappointment because the adjustment of the straps won't stay where I put them."
3,How life is like if you choose to a full parent,"I am not a parent thus, this book allows me an insight into full time parenthood. I was attracted to this book not because it preaches parental duties, rather, I was intrigued by what a child could teach me about life- the title of the edition that I have does not mention trout fishing nor jelly toast. Before I commenced reading this book, I already have preconceived ideas about what these teachings are. Got some of these correct while missing some. One that struck me intensely was the depiction of the elder child wanting to kick a dead squirrel. How real and how many times we want to do the same but never cos' it is not the honorable thing to do, so we think. But kids are more intuitive and unpolluted by the adult notion of what's right and what's wrong. They just do what come to their mind. The search for a good school will strike a chord with any parent struggling to decide which school is best for his/ her child."
2,It broke in five months.,"I gave my wife the Briel coffee maker for Christmas, 2001. Everything worked fine until two weeks ago; the espresso part of the machine is flawless, but the simple (?) drip coffee section has developed a leak, so that only about half of the water actually makes it to the pot, and the rest escapes in a cloud of steam. To make matters worse, it's a heavy unit, and shipping it out for repairs won't be cheap, and on top of that, the manufacturer wants to be paid $12.00 to return it to me! I think I should get a bit more reliability for 250 bucks. I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality ."
5,Excellent,"This is by far the most uselful book I've bought this year. I consider myself an above-average user when it comes to Excel, and wanted to get a head start on this new release before my office upgrades. When I purchase a computer book I want something that reads easily, and explains the workings of the software in a coherent way. I'd bought Laurie Ulrich's books in the past and stuck with her for just these reasons. Blattner's chapters read almost as well, and I guess that's why the publishers teamed them up: they know what they're talking about, and know how to explain it. The best thing about this book is you don't need to be a rocket scientist to get something out of it. My wife, who's not a computer person, has been using the book too and feels it's one of the few books that doesn't make her feel inadequate because she's not a ""power-user"". What more can I say? I highly recommend it."
4,What you're looking for,Do you need an hose to connect your Badger airbrush to a compressor? Well you can't go wrong with this one! Even though 10' is far longer than I need I haven't had any issues. The fabric housing has held up really well and makes it easy to handle.
1,does not fit,"So I purchased an air brush, quick release and this braided air hose. The air brush and quick release work well they screw together fine. The hose? forget it. The small end just does not fit into anything save your money and get something else. Now I need to figure out what works with what. OK maybe my fault but darn it I want to use this now"
3,The Cat,It was a charming story but hardly great literature. Enjoyable. I read it because of the Scotland info as I am leaving in a few weeks for my first trip to Scotland and thought it would be a fun story to read beforehand. I was not disappointed. I'm also a cat lover so always enjoy the cats in these stories.
4,(Sk)Thanks for the laughs!,"OK. As a Dave Attell fan, some of the material is a repeat from other comedy shows of his -- the reason for one less star. But, to a new listener, this is one of the raunchiest, gut-busting comedy CD's I have ever heard. From his rants of topics like women, little people (he uses a different name), traveling, partying, and his childhood, to the parrot who pops up for advice, ""****** for the Memories"" will keep you laughing until you have a hernia. Not for the faint of heart, but for those who have a sense of humor that cannot be tolerated on basic cable!"
1,This book is not what it seems,"If you are someone who enjoys inteligent, interesting, believable naratives... If you are a fan of Alice Hoffman, Ursula Hegi, Jane Hamilton, Rebecca Wells... If these are the kinds of authors and books that you enjoy, this is not a book for you. It is a thinly vailed romance type novel, cloaked with post World War 2 drama. There is no good reason to spend your time and money on this book, as I regretfully did."
4,Old golfer says:,I've been trying to learn to play golf for some years now and found some very good help in various places. Swinging too hard and just trying to hit the ball have been my constant downfall. Tis book is finally helping me to understand and execute a smoother more fluid golf swing. FHurray.Not only that: this book has helped me understand a number of concepts that I have been constantly encouraged to do and never understood.I wish that I had found it years ago.Gary
4,A good basic approach...,"The book presents a good basic approach to understanding the golf swing. The social aspect of golf brings with it the desire to play well enough not to be conspicuously inept. This book will help you get there, to play well enough! It's easy to read and well written. I've bought enough books to know that not everyone agrees with what Hogan or Els or Woods write in their instruction books. This book gives instruction much more basic without fanfare and without terminology that presupposes a deeper knowledge of the game.I can't give it 5 stars because that denotes ""the best"". No man (or woman) will live long enough to read all the golf books in and out of print to determine which is ""the best""."
5,Feel Your Own Golf Swing,"After working with theGood at Golf Training Method(highly recommended) I picked up this book.Took me just some hours to get through it. I've been playing for some time now and still struggled with my irons. It's hard to believe that it could be this simple, but it sure looks that way. I have only done one session at the range, but I feel confident that what the book teaches is a good way to build a decent swing. The instruction is short and to the point and you really start to feel your own swing. I am already improving in distance and consistency."
2,Jimmy Ballard redo,"While the advice is this book is solid, it appears to come almost directly from Jimmy Ballard theories i.e. weight shift, keeping the triangle, connection, etc. The ""lighthouse"" concept is covered in a drill in George Knudson's book on Natural Golf. After contemplating the many conflicting theories of grip, setup, mental pictures, and contrasting those theories with the widely varying mechanics of top tour stars, I think golf is a combination of reasonable fundamentals, lots of practice and focus, the makeup of your body, and just plain talent. I recommend the golf instruction books by George Knudson, John Redmon, and a difficult to find book by ""Wild"" Bill Melhorn (a tour player that Ben Hogan called the best ball striker he ever saw). These authors take the ""natural"" approach to the golf swing, i.e., working with the natural tendencies of the body."
5,Outstanding!!!!,"I ordered this bulb for a replacement. the shipping was fast the bulb packaged correctly the box even arrived in pristine condition.great job guys, this company does a wonderful job i will definitley order from them again. Cudos for UPS as well."
4,Works well,"Its a decently constructed cooling/ bake rack. I have had it for a week, and I Use it for cooling Breads, Cookies, and pastry. The mesh is finer than I had thought, but still easy to wash in-between. Sturdy enough to hold about 10lb of Bread Loaves. Fits perfectly in a Half Sheet pan. Lastly, the item came slightly Convex; ie it has a ""crown"" in the middle. I just bent it ever so slightly."
3,Good for the Young Child,"Like all the Baby Genius I think it is good, it should be rated for younger children as an 18 month old get's a little bored with it, they prefer the sing alongs much better and this one seems to bore her."
2,Not as good as other Baby Genius DVDs,"""Same complaints I had about the Under Water Adventure DVD. It played classical music and showed no real children or activities. Did not keep the attention of my 17-month old. What she enjoys most about the Baby Genius videos is the singing and the real children acting/dancing. I pulled this out after 5 minutes and put in Baby Genius Children's Songs."""
3,Cheaply Made,"This toy seemed to be perfect for my 12 month old's birthday, but within a few days he had removed the wooden pegs holding the red wooden circle up in the air. (which does not have much of a point... I didn't really like that part so I left the pegs off.) Mine has not come apart into shards like some of the other reviews have said and it has been about a year and a half since I bought it. My son is pretty rough with it too.to sum it up it is a fun little toy. But don't expect it to be sturdy. The pegs can hurt your kids if they get them off when they are alone with it."
3,A wonderful original fairy tale book for ages 4 or 5 to 8.,"I read ""Shadow Castle"" 30 years ago and still have my Scholastic Book Club copy. It's a wonderful book for age 8's or so to read to themselves or to read out loud to the 5 and 6-year-olds. Each chapter is a self-contained story, with the book bound together by the two main characters, a little girl and a young man, the fairy family, and an enchanted valley. I am so glad to see that it's in print again."
3,Comentario sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Maria Isabel,"Esta Telenovela la Compre por el Elenco que tiene y porque la encontre en Oferta.Me Gusto mucho, contiene lo mas importante de la Novela.No tiene el Tema Principal, de Alejandro Fernandez, Si Tu Supieras, tiene una Musica Instrumental.Faltan muchas Escenas, pero dentro de todo vale la pena."
3,KINDA WEAK,"Perform adequately, especially in a small room. Mine are in a larger bedroom and 2 barely do the job"
1,Didn't work!,"One of the air purifiers did not work. I had to send them back. Do NOT buy this product. Buy the Sharper Image brand. Now, that's quality!"
1,"no good, no guarantee","This product came defective, Amazon claims to have an A-Z guarantee, but they do not. The reseller, Butterfly Photo, does no returns. The manufacturer will not honor warranties if bought through Amazon as most are defective.Save your money, buy a different brand elsewhere!"
2,Not so great,The price was good but I have not noticed much of a difference and I don't see much when I cleaned the blades. There was no much capture by the Ionic Pro.
1,TOTAL CRAP,"I purchased 4 of these useless items and by the 13 month 1 quit working, one month later a 2nd one died and by the 185th month the 3rd on died.Find something better to clean your air..."
3,Captains and the Kings,"Book arrived on time and in condition expected - slightly more wear on spine than reported, but overall acceptable."
5,Excellent Book,"I've read this book once before at the request of a friend. I'm not much of a reader, but I agreed and borrowed this book from her. I found that I could not put it down and finished it with such haste. This was several years ago. Even to this day, people as me about what I've read, and this book always makes the top 10 list. I would suggest anyone over the age of 14 should read this novel. Since I didn't have a copy of my own, I decided to buy this from Amazon, and it showed up in perfect condition in a timely fashion."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"This movie is horrible!!! What a waste of money and of my time. First off the previews made it appear as if it was about a man looking for a ""Proverbs 31:30"" woman and it was nothing of the sort! Then they use Christian Keyes who was a actor in many of Tyler Perry plays so I immediate thought this was a Christian friendly movie. A movie based on nothing but LUST! Dont waste your money. 0 out of 5 popcorn bags for me. SMH"
3,Young adult relationships are in demand,"It's getting to a point that the straight to dvd movies are cutting corners skimping on the ingredients... I really like the movie the cast is potent, it has star power The script had bite but needed more tweaking by the director... It was the picture quality, the studio sets and the lighting that mumbled (low budget)... The actors came, the conquered.., But the picture quality of movies like love & basketball, Brothers,Soul food has set the bar real high... One scene, the club or party was to dark.., The shower scene was smoking but the set looked B-list... Another thing in regard to the Amazon dvd venders they'll learn the same lesson the Blockbusters and Hollywood video franchises learned... Your ""over charging"" the customers.... There must really be in market for the out of control or desperate buyer..."
4,Still a Good Movie,"Overall I really liked the movie. Since I am a fan of Christian Keyes, I wanted see his performance in the movie. I did not like the ending in the movie. It ended to abruptly. Could have been tweaked a little more to end the movie out better than it did. Otherwise, it was a good comedy movie."
5,The ladies seem to like the smell....,they used to tell me so but that was before I got old and invisable. I use it every now and then because even though they won't notice me passing by they will at least get a wiff of what used to be. Too bad it cost so much.
5,Aramis Devin,Great seller. Good service. So glad to find this cologne. Have had more compliments from this scent than any other.
5,Static Characters,"Rand's characters are critisized for being too static, and it is true, they are static, but purposely so. If all the characters in the novel went around contridicting themselves in all there actions, then the whole point of Rand's books would be loss. Roark can't be dynamic because he encompasses an ideal. If he contradicted the ideal, he would not be Rand's hero of the novel. I would also like to add that just because a novel is plain stated does not mean it is intellectually inferior to so called complicated novels. The whole philosophy is plain stated because it has to be in order not to contradict the philosophy. Any one who makes the above argument is intellectual inferior."
5,currently listening on audio cook,"I am currently listening to this on audio and its pretty good. My brother is an architect and it took me while to get into it because i am not but after i started tuning into it, its hard NOT to get into it and i soon started requesting he put it on. havent gotten through but about 10 hours f it but is pretty good and i would wholeheartedly recommend it. even the 12 year old is listening to it."
1,A laughable bit of trash.,"I was 12 when, intrigued after seeing the movie on TV, I read it, and scoffed all the way through. Over 700 pages of the most puerile drivel. What a hack. Even at that early age, I fully comprehended the misanthropic bent of this tome. That people should turn it into the philosophical foundation of their polity toward others bespeaks the abject nadir of humanity."
1,drawn out pablum,"Rand takes nearly 700 pages to reach her climax. To avoid spoiling such an excruciating experience, I'll say only that it involves Howard Roark pontificating for a good ten pages in a courtroom showdown. What's even worse is that Rand, who toots the horn of individual genius louder than anyone, can't write her way out of a paper bag. Her plot is a rickety construction to prop up her cartoonish characters (the rugged individualist hero, the women who love him, the men who envy him). Rand also shows a fondness for borrowed expressions (the French ""par excellence"" seems to be a particular favorite of hers; Roark is continually described as the the this or that par excellence), a considerable irony given her dogmatic attacks on the nebulous hordes of ""second-handers"" who have plagued studly heros like Howard since the invention of the wheel. Like any perversion, this book might be entertaining, but...[it]just isn't my idea of a good time."
5,Architecture students and The Fountainhead,"I received this book as a present from a family member. With the little time that I have to spare I kept it on my bookcase unopened for half a year. As soon as I started reading The Fountainhead I was hooked. As an architecture student I can relate to the architecture themes and the characters presented in the novel. Not only could I relate to the characters, but I was enveloped on the personalities of the characters and the outcome of their actions. Ayn Rands descriptive way of writing is so specific that one can easily make a picture of the buildings and projects described. As I read all I thought about was flying to New York to see the buildings that were described, then I would realize that they aren't real and I think that such buildings should.I sincerely recommend this book to people who are interested in architecture. I know that architecture is very time consuming, but if you can spare a few minutes a day to read this book, you should."
5,Ayn's Masterpiece,"After reading Atlas Shrugged (AS), I found it hard to believe that A.R. could out do herself. I must admit, however, that I found the Fountainhead to be far superior. What makes it better is the dialog and characterization, which are much more natural and deeper than in AS. In AS, it seemed as if all the characters are one dimensional actors, only there to illustate A.R.'s philosophical principles. Toohey's character is particularly outstanding. I have never encountered a character that more accurately embodies evil in its purest form. What makes Toohey especially frightening is that his evil is of the intellectual, rather than the physical, variety. His speech to Keating on the nature of power (at the end) is a classic!"
2,"The Fountainhead serves those who ""have problems with it""","The book is alright but it would have been better if it dealt more with me instead of that selfish mean hermit Howard Roark.He keeps doing what HE wants instead of what others think he SHOULD do.He should not do that because it is anti-social. That is what I hate most about this book. All he cares about is what makes him happy instead of what makes me happy.I suspect that is why others rail against the book soooo much: Roark does not bow to them and they hate it. So do I, but I will give the novel some credit because for collectivists like me it gives us a villain to hate.Even if those low intellect people think he is a hero."
4,Gut wrenching truth is hard to take.,"Thought provoking and insightful, a look into what is still the american society. At times I was given over to deep sadness and meloncoly, other moments were like the sun shining through the clouds. A wel written emotional rollercoaster to pick and choose your moral from. I am happy to say that though it is not the reality we live in there is an ideal we could work with. In creativity and knowledge base Ayn Rand led me on a journey through the unthoughtof field of architecture into human greed, shame, and ultimit joy. Written in multifaceted and ever changing/growing perspectives, I dub this a look into the human spirit."
3,"Can you say ""bloated?""","When I first read this book in my younger years, I thought that it was magnificient.Looking back, I realize that it has taught me that it is indeed possible to say a great deal and simultaneously assert nothing. If you want a first class example of that, here it is."
1,Print is way way too small,"Be aware that library binding is just a paperback with a hard cover, I found out the hard way. The print is too small, get the full sized hard cover of this book. The book is fantastic."
1,True decadence,"Shorter Ayn Rand: A combination of greed and cruelty will get you more power, sex and money than either greed or cruelty alone.It's a crummy novel, too. When I was in college, long ago, the architecture students used to arrange a showing of the movie version once a year, at which they would jeer and hoot and holler not unlike the way a later generation behaved at 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'"
5,A Classic,"Ayn Rand out-did herself on this book. Though usually overshadowed by Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is arguably Rand's greatest piece. It is the true story of a hero with his back against the wall, in a struggle to fight for what is right. For all of you socialists out there, pay close attention to Ellsworth Toohey- it might be like looking in the mirror."
1,Neofascist propaganda,"The problem with The Fountainhead is that it is intended to seduce its target audience (high school and college age kids) to embrace right wing politics. Kids who read The Fountainhead have seldom ever read or have a clear understanding of politics, philosophy, and sociology. After reading The Fountainhead kids will come away parroting Ayn Rand's polemics. Kids who read The Fountainhead remind me of kids who used to study the works of Karl Marx in the 60s and 70s: they put down the book thinking they now have all the answers to life. Most kids abandon objectivism (like kids in the 60s and 70s abandoned socialism) after they experience life. But, oh, how annoying they can be until then! The book still wields a cult-like trance with the young which is why The Fountainhead will always remain (after the Bible) the book most kids claim changed their lives. Happy reading! --This text refers to the hardcover edition of this title"
4,Inspiring and absurd. A good read.,"The story an architect, Howard Roark, the quintessentialObjectivist Man - uncompromising, aloof, independent. Thebook is thoroughly engaging, and holds your interest to theend, even if most of the characters are overblown andunbelievable. Should be read as fiction and not philosophy."
3,"Good book, lots of erros","The Fountainhead is a great piece of literature. The kindle makes it even easier to grasp because of the sheer length of the actual paperback. The problem with the kindle version is the number of spelling and grammatical errors. Amazon, please fix this!"
5,Leave your current life with a book,"Amazing, how a book written so long ago can be written about some people today. It is as if some people on one side of the political spectrum seem to follow the book. Besides philosphy, this is good reading for a story in itself. Long book, and the characters become a part of your life."
4,Howard Roark,"Ayn Rand is a very different writer with her unique philosophy of Objectivism. Her support for the individual is epitomized with Howard Roark who refuses to sacrifice his principles for anyone. There are Five main characters in the book, Howard Roark, Gail Wynand, Peter, Ellsworth, and Dominique. The plot is straight forward, and it is a easy read. The themes the book deals with are integrity and individuality. This book is worth reading."
4,"Definitely worth reading, but be prepared.","I liked this book, but I did not like the amount of rhetoric I had to weed through in order to get to the actual point. The philosophical muddiness of this novel became oppressive, especially Roark's massive speech at the end. It was difficult, because it requires you to pay attention, not out of interest, but because a massive argument is being put together, and it would be very frustrating if you got all the way through it and missed the point. I just feel that she could have made the point of the novel with less pages and more interesting fiction. My biggest complaint about Ayn Rand is she does not ever seem to clearly state that her philosophy is designed to further yourself, but not by screwing your buddy over, and, as a result, too many people use it to justify these ends. Just be prepared and informed when you undertake this novel"
3,No one is that perfect.........,".......or that evil. Those of you that have read this book will know what I mean. Those of you that have not, will find out. Let me first say that you should read this book, it is a very good story. It differs greatly from ""Atlas Shrugged"", however, in that there is not one single human being in ""The Fountainhead"" that one could look up to. Howard Rourks ideals are simply too lofty to be taken seriously (remember that this is just a novel and as such Ms. Rand can take all the leeway she wishes. Superman is a fictional hero also). The rest of the charactors are so evil that they too are beyond belief. In ""Atlas Shrugged"" one could truly admire the strength of the charactors and grab with both hands their struggle against others who felt the world owed them everything as their destiny. I do suggest that you give this a try. But, don't say that I did not warn you."
1,Yuck!,This is certainly and most definitely the most boring book i have read in my whole life.There is a lot of hype created around this book and that is why i think a lot of them thinks that if the book is not liked by them then they are not literally normal...
1,short and sweet,"If you liked the celestine prophesy, you'll like this.... take that as you will and refer back to number of stars. same dogma thinly veiled by ""plot"" and ""characterization."""
1,So wrong in so many ways,"Ayn Rand is so wrong in so many ways -- and spreads her mistakes out over hundereds and hundereds of interminable pages. ""The Fountainhead"" could be unintentionally funny, a kind of trashy read, a giggle for people with a brain. In fact it's just dull, full of stooges for Rand's tenets haplessly disguised as characters. And, oh, she doesn't know the first thing about architecture, either."
4,One of my favorites,"I am a junior in high school. When I first read The Fountainhead, it was like a revelation for me. I thought that my life was basically meaningless as it was, and to truly experience enlightenment I must learn to be ""selfish"". However, that initial passion has since faded, and I can now step back and see some of the fallacies of the book. Although great in concept, Objectivism, as the extreme opposite of Communism, may work in much the same way. I also noticed that characters in Rand's books (I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and We the Living), especially the female characters, are fundamentally very similar, both in appearance and character. This does not detract from the books' overall appeal, but does take away a little of the mystery and intrigue. I love these books though, and while not agreeing totally with every aspect of Rand's philosophy, I appreciate the beautiful workmanship of her writing."
3,"a good book, but somewhat annoying","it is generally said about ayn rand novels that you can either love them or hate them; i feel both. it was a great novel in the creative sense, i liked the way she developed her characters and described all of the sensory details, but i did not agree with most of the ideas she was trying to pound into my head. she uses egotism as an excuse for not caring about anyone, for remaining indifferent to everything. that just seems like laziness to me. i enjoyed the book, but it got tedious at times, during the extensive monologues in the courtrooms, and when roark is trying to sell his work to someone who isn't so sure... and especially towards the middle, when roark first meets dominique. every glance, every smile, every movement by either of them must be analyzed to *death!* it does give you something to chew on, though, and i don't think anyone who reads this book will be able to look at the world the same way again."
2,Prefer Atlas Shrugged,I have started but never finished this book. I have heard that people usually prefer either The Fountainhead OR Atlas Shrugged. I just happen to prefer Dagny to Roark.
3,Pages missing from Centinial Edition,"Until page 137 I was enjoying this book (despite the seemingly inexhaustable number of contrived, characters). But then, at the bottom of page 137 of the Mass Market Paperback Centinial Edition, the sentence Peter Keating is uttering never ends -- the next page is the beginning of THE NEXT CHAPTER!! I have no idea how many pages I'm missing. Urrgghhh."
5,a definate must have,"This is one of the greatest inventions for baking!!! I havethis and another brand and they are great. Nothing sticksto it and easy to clean. No fuss no muss no bother! The cookiesdo tend to bake a bit faster so keep an eye on the time. Only draw back the first few times of use there is an oder but, after a few uses it will subside. ... Anything to make baking a little more simpler . And as an avid and frequent baker this exopat is a real dream come true.Fantastic price on this also ! They are quite a bit more in the stores. I am buying more for gifts to the bakers in the familey so they can have it as easy when they bake their cookies."
5,magic!,"Love the Matfer Exopat! Was paranoid about something resembling plastic in the oven as I try to minimize plastics with food, especially hot food, but after researching the product I couldn't find any reason not to use it. I am very impressed with how food turns out (cookies, meatballs, baked sweet potato fries) and how easy it is to clean!! Seems to really help things cook evenly and I can't imagine going back to parchment paper. I will be buying these as gifts for bakers this year."
5,Excellent product!,"I bought this baking sheet for one reason - to bake coconut macaroons for my Dad. The coconut sticks so badly on the baking sheets I was using, that I just hated making them anymore. Now, Dad is happy and so am I. They come out beautifully. So much easier to make them now. I just love it!"
3,Not a baking necessity,"Overall good product, though a little frustrating is the fact that it doesn't fit a standard baking sheet. Another problem is the static cling- which causes little dust particles and dirt to cling- so there is a need to clean and wash before and after use.I do use the product- but let's just say I haven't stopped using disposable parchment paper either."
5,mat,It workes perfectly and easy to clean. The cookies don't slide off like on a baking sheet. But are easly removed.
5,Cleanup is a breeze!,"I've had this silicone liner for only a few weeks and I've already used it several times. It came in extrememly handy during the holiday baking season. I baked cookies, scones, and yeast breads on it, and nothing got stuck."
3,requires more baking time,"I bake a lot of cookies, and thought this might reduce clean-up time. It certainly does keep items from sticking to the pan, eliminating the need to scour. But the bottoms of my cookies don't brown nearly as quickly as they do when placed directly on the cookie sheet, or on parchment. The added baking time, when making multiple batches, is a great deal longer than any time saved cleaning. I recommend the sheet for larger pastry items. But busy cookie bakers may be disappointed with this item."
5,One of the greatest short novels of our time,"Perhaps one of the least known(popular)but greatest works from McMurtry. Three life stories are woven thoughout this tale as this story picks up where Horeseman Pass By leaves off, with regard to character development.If you are a fan of Lonesome Dove, Moving On or All My Friends Are Going To Be Strangers, you cannot help but marvel at this earlier work which puts most modern works to shame.The characters and scenery are depicted with a subtle brilliance and the prose is magnificent. This book could be described as a blend of both Faulkner and McCarthy with regards to writing-you can feel the influence from the former and on the latter.Pardon my long winded comments. Buy the book and revel in it's brilliance.-"
1,Cowboy Days of Our Lives,"If you want to enter into the world of three of the most boring characters ever, by all means read this book. This is a world where cowboys drop by to see lonely women and (wonder of wonders)HAVE SEX WITH THEM! Yes, the cowboys desire adventure and they even go off once to sell some cattle. But in a bizzare plot twist, one turns around after a few weeks and believe it or not, returns home and has some more sex with the lonely lady. The fact that none of the characters has much more to say than ""I sure missed Gid,"" or ""I really loved Molly,"" really keeps you flipping those pages. I am a great fan of this writer and I'm open minded to seeing all sides of his creative world, but as I read this book I kept getting the idea that he was trying to corner the Jackie Collins crowd. Read Lonesome Dove again instead."
3,a nice trio album,"mr. hurst ventures forth as a leader after very solid stints as bassist for wynton marsalis, branford marsalis, and the tonight show band. this album is a thoughtful, although not very experimental session. it is also a nice momento of kenny kirkland. the songs range from low burn burnout to sweet ballads. at times the trio seems a bit lost (eg. ""incognegro"") and the whole session suffers from a production flaw that makes elvin jones' drums sound like he wasn't even in the room with the other two and they simply pasted his parts over the top of mr. kirkland and mr. hurst. however, there are stellar moments. ""jill of all trades,"" ""innuendo in yo window,"" and ""thad's blue plaid"" shine as high moments of trio interaction. The feeling is defintely there, as well as the swing. these make the whole cd worth having. mr. hurst is a solid peformer, but compositionally he seems to need to grow."
5,A Great Book,"I bought this book for my brother-in-law, a fix-it man. I did give it to him. However, when I saw how beautiful the book and its illustrations were, I wanted it for myself. Who doesn't need to know how to do things around home?"
1,Just opened the box,"Well, I cannot comment on how this machine works as I just opened the box. What I do want to say is that there is NO VHS tape included and I cannot figure out where the heck they would have put it if there was as there is no place in the box for it. The second thing is that the instruction manual that DID come with this machine is very vague. I guess I'll have more to say later about the operations of the machine."
1,not durable,the product was not durable and had to be repaired 2 times in 18 months...1 time was not under warrenty.
3,"Work well, mostly with pods","I agree with most of the reviews. In the beginning, the machine works well, but then starts leaking. Oftentimes, it is because of the way you grind the coffee. If ground too thin, it will leak. And if ground too coarse, nothing will happen. It can be very very messy at times.But it works very very well when I use pods. Illy or Lavazza pods work well, and the crema is still good. Definitely a decent purchase....but don't expect to keep it for ever. You'll want to upgrade. Then you can use the Briel Cadiz for the office with pods (avoid the mess!), and keep a better one for home."
3,NO VIDEO!!!,"The machine would be great if not for the fact that they send you the video that is supposed to be included, and wasn't, and now I have to go through the red tape to get the video as to how it works! I wish that the products would come with what they tell you they come with!!!"
5,Awesome book on an awesome natural phenomenon,"I remember checking this book out at the local library and reading it cover-to-cover at least 4 times when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen. That was around 10 years ago, and I still remember bits and pieces of it. It was that good. Now, I suggest you pick up a copy of this before more people discover how good it is and it becomes a rare/collecible item. Highly recommended if you like reading non-fiction about tornadoes."
5,Useful Help for a Serious Problem,"I purchased this book for my husband who has hypertension himself and heart disease on his father's side. He's begun reading the book and has already started altering his eating patterns. Dr Braverman certainly knows his subject and gives you a lot of background knowledge and understanding on how brain chemistry affects the functioning of every organ in the body and gives you hope in being able to make changes in yourself through what you eat and take in the way of supplements to bring about improvement.This book, for us, isn't just an academic read as the help it gives will be life changing."
3,"Good, but not great without Glenn Miller himself","This CD is good music and a good listen, covering all of Miller's original tunes, but any recording made after Glenn Miller's death always seems to be missing the magical spark that the original recordings had."
5,Cars of the Fabulous Fifties,The book 'Cars of the Fabulous Fifties' arrived in the shape as described in the ad - in Great Shape.
3,Average science fiction from the 1950s,"Frederik Pohl is a classic science fiction author. I have enjoyed several of his stories.I came across Gladiator-At-Law for a dollar and decided to give it a try.I wasn't impressed.The story takes place in a dysfunctional world where the rich have great, superficial lives, and the poor suffer in welfare houses. Our hero picks up a case with a beautiful woman who claims to be the heir to a fortune. There is lots of excitement and things work out in the end.If you like pulp fiction from the 1950s, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, you can find better science fiction with many other books."
2,"WHAT'S ON THIS ""DISC 2""?","I want to order this, but need to know WHAT IS ON IT FIRST! Are there TWO discs to Season 2? Or does ""Disc 2"" just mean 2 of 7 discs (i.e. 1 DVD = 1 season?). Need more detail!"
4,Tragic human story,Very well written story of what happened when Manseau's parents and some of their friends thought they understood what Vatican 2 was going to mean to the Church and in fact did not understand it at all. If you are old enough to remember the the buzz around Vatican 2 it was quite exciting but not too many knew exactly what it meant and of course everyone was being profoundly impacted by the popular values of the age around them.The book is also an expose of another priest who while reaping the benefits of being a clergy member was not only not living up to the demands of the priesthood but was living contrary to them.I thought this book was well worth buying.
5,Excelent Customer Service,"I ordered this for a recently purchased Honda Pilot...The cargo mat arrived quickly. My carpet is protected from firewood, bags of fertilizer, and such. I had a question about the order, and my email was responded to almost instantaneously...really good customer service. Great guys to do business with !"
5,A Legend,The album brought back memories from the my time growing up. I love the album and was glad to receive it within days.
2,These ladies are spinning in their graves.,"Diane Schuur's smooth jazz style does not do justice to standards. She should stick to doing soft rock covers and Smooth Jazz songs. Anybody who cares about Ella, Sarah, Carmen and Billie should stay way from this album."
2,The Math inSTINKS,"I was suckered by the description and this book fails to deliver....The reason I gave two stars: some teenagers or true novices to the subject may find some of the stories interesting enough to turn them onto better works in the field.There is NOTHING new in this book: Devlin desperately looks for a new angle to a Greek philosophical fight- which is not necessarily bad (see ""the Anthropology of Art"") BUT he doesn't take any new angle- he just searches and speculates - like a tired dog circling for a place to lie down.The filler of the book is what anyone would expect- scientific research and 'interesting' tidbits about the physical world... once again, nothing new. Save your money."
2,"Great for teachers, not so great for students","I had to read this book for one of my classes and I was not particularly fond of it. It is very hard to read, especially if you're new to Buddhism. I was hoping to get a good, concise explanation of the religion but instead I got a book where the author is so dry that it barely kept me awake.In all fairness, I would say that it is a good book if you're looking for details and you're really into Buddhism."
2,The Order-worst of the year,"lets make this short and sweet.This movie has some great ideas and concepts, but there was no story here. They threw in the basic elements of love, sacrifice, battle between good and evil, but they never actually developed any of it to make sense.quite simply, the movie makes you constantly feel like ""SHUT UP!! WHO CARES!!"". If movie tickets didn't cost so much I would have walked out, but I decided to punish myself and stay till the crappy end.This was the first movie me and my friends could talk loud and make fun of the movie while it was playing and the audience enjoyed us more then this film....acting=3 starsFX=NAending=3 starsatmosphere=4.5 starsEditing&Directing;=2 starstoryline=2 starsmeaningfullness=1 starOVERALL 2.58 stars"
2,Not What I Expected,"I suppose I expected a little more from this film after seeing the previews. When I rented this film I expected something of a more supernatural tale (And a better written story!) The end of this film left me feeling that there needed to be a little more, and I don't mean that in the sense that I didn't want it to end. I mean to say that this film leaves you hanging and feeling that you spent your time watching a film without a complete conclusion, and not in a manner which would lend itself well to a sequel. In my opinion, a few tweaks of the plot would have made this movie all that more exciting and satisfying! Enough about the story...The acting perhaps was the finer point of this film, with Heath Ledger delivering a capable interpretation of a priest from a disappearing religious clan. The supporting actors and actresses also did a fine job portraying their characters.Overall, I give this film 2 stars."
3,Out Of Order,"It didn't fully hit me until after viewing this film that I was utterly confused by it. I rather enjoyed watching it; the look was dark and moody, the pace was quick enough, and the subject matter was interesting. However, what is ""The Order""? Is it the group Heath Ledger belongs to? No, it can't be. There are only two of them, and that makes a couple (Hardly an Order). Is it the freaky-deaky underground cult? Could be, but they're so muddled and sparsely placed throughout that they come across as more of an afterthought than a central part of the plot.The subject is promising, but this film is a bit unfocused and out of order."
3,The Order,"The movie featured Heath Ledger, I saw part of this movie on late night TV and was unable to watch the end. Our local video outlet had 4 copies all out when I enquired and all well overdue. It depicted a anti religious overtone and what I saw of the movie was intriguing holding simimlar overtones as angles and demonds. The film was enjoyable however the dvd froze during playing at a point where the main character ""starts to loose his way"".The plot centred on the killing of the head of an order within the catholic church and Heath Ledgers characters attemps to find out by whom and why."
2,"Great potential, fell flat MISNAMED","This movie should have been titled differently. There was virtually nothing in its plot about ""the order"", but rather it was all about the sineater which left this viewer confused.The whole plot was confusing. There were too many loose ends, too dark, too bad. The girl should have been the saving grace of the movie, not sacrificed in the boring plot. Peter Weller was not convincing in his ambition. I was disappointed in this movie."
1,Poor workmanship is evident,One would expect better quality from a tool maker like Grizzly. The joinery was sloppy and the hinges were put on at an angle. Isn't anybody paying attention to the details? I wouldn't buy another product from them without first inspecting it. Shame on Amazon for carrying such an inferior product. We all expect better.
5,My daughter still loves this......,Alice in Wonderland (Two-Disc Special Un-Anniversary Edition)...is a bonus movie I have never totally understood this movie but it's a Disney classic!~ Always the best price on Amazon!~
4,Alice In Wonderland,I ordered this for my daughters for Easter! We watched it and it did not work after 20mins.in to it. I contacted the dealer and he gave me direction on how to return it w/o paying the shipping cost. They sent me a new one in less than a week. The new one we got work wonderfully.
3,Great movie,I like disney movies and this is a classic. I watch this movie with my daughter. i received the item as described and I received it fast
2,"To odd, and a little boring","We ranked this 33 out of 41 Disney animated movies that we own. We bought this movie and it was a mistake. The children watched it once and never again. There are so many good disney movies now available, this one is never requested by the kids for viewing."
1,Disney's Adventures in WONDERLAND VHS~2 Helping Hands,"First, this was not the VHS I ordered. I ordered Alice in Wonderland VHS Disney Masterpiece. I was trying to complete my collection. The item I received appeared brand new, in a cardboard slip cover, and arrived immediately. I just wish it had been the selection shownAlice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]on Amazon.com. The review photo of the VHS is correct, but I guess your link wasn't??"
2,A Horrible Movie for All!,"Alice in Wonderland"" was not all that great, and the movie stands as the worst thing Disney studio has ever turned out. The characters are the most unsympathetic, nasty, insane bunch ever gathered together, and that includes our heroin. You never feel like anyone in this movie is worthy of our support. The score is not that great, the script lacking a basic storyline, and some aspects of this movie really make the whole thing seem like a drug trip (and a bummer at that). Only the remarkable Ed Wynn, Jerry Colona, and their marvelous ""Unbirthday Song"" really stand out positively in the mind. Disney has turned out so many quality films over the years. Get ""Snow White,"" or ""Pinocchio,"" or ""Dumbo,"" or ""Lady and the Tramp."" Just not this."
1,Wrong item,"Alice in Wonderland is what I ordered, but apparently there is a barcode problem (according to the retailer) and this item is not available. I got the Village instead - I guess if you want that, go ahead and order this! I' sure if the correct movie would really show up my review would have been great."
5,Wonderful!,The movie is wonderful on my kindle fire! It comes in clear. My grandson loves to sit and watch in the car and gets the giggles when the flowers sing! Great classic Disney movie!!
2,Confusing,I watched this movie two times. I have no clue as to what's going on...and English is my primary language. I cannot imagine a child watching this movie and getting anything out of it.
1,DVD does not play,"So yet another DVD that does not play correctly. Inside reads something about ""made in Mexico"" but whatever, DVD's are supposed to last 100 years but I have had far more problems with DVD's than I ever had with VHS Tapes. What's up with that? (and no, it is not my dvd player, I always test on multiple working players)"
1,What - no Blu-Ray?,I can't believe Disney is not releasing this on Blu-Ray. I had hoped all of the Disney cartoons would be. I guess this is still considered a second-rate movie. I am disappointed. :(
2,The Mad Libs of Disney Films!,"This movie is totally mediocre and insane! The story choices are just mind boggling! The story choices are like the Mad Libs of disney movies! Alice comes across butterflies with...bread! There is a game of croquet using...flamingos and moles! None of the characters or wierdos in Wonderland help Alice at all, Oliver Wallace's music in this movie is just crappy, it's just makes me want to throw up! That ""Painting the Roses Red"" song is just stupid, especially when the painters' cards are dragged away, they are singing stupidly about being beheaded! And speaking of which, that Queen of Hearts is one of the dumbest Disney Villains I have ever seen! I always liked it better when Prince John from ""Robin Hood said ""Off with His/her head!"" There's no mediocre song in that! Unless customers want a Disney film that spirals into insanity, I suggest they skip this one."
3,Disney movie for my youngster,My daughter enjoyed it but I consider this one of Disney's weaker films. All films that end with the character waking up from a dream usually lose some points with me anyway. Still if you get it at a good price it is worth it.
4,Love Disney!,"Alice in Wonderland is truly the magical dreams for children. The one draw back is that this is made more for children over the age of 8-or-9, not the younger group, I didn't think. But, I love Disney, so all the movies are good to me."
5,The original,This is the original Disney movie that many of us grew up with. It is now re-mastered and looks great even on the new TVs.Make sure to grab this to share with your future generations.
5,Alice in Wonderland,"I grew up watching Walt Disney movies and I have always enjoyed them. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is no exception. I have always liked Walt Disney and I probably will until my death. Regarding my age, I am sixty-three years old."
4,"Under-appreciated, edgy classic from Disney","I watched Disney's animated ""Alice In Wonderland"" at the request of my 10 year-old daughter. Based on my (decades-old) memories of seeing this in the theater, I was fully expecting a sugar overload. To my surprise and great pleasure, I was treated to a riot of color, manic activity and enough edgy darkness to make this a truly worthy Lewis Carroll adaptation.Featuring voice-work from some of old Hollywood's greatest character actors, the animators seemed inspired to explore the limits of their wildest imaginings...creating a Wonderland of marvels, wackiness and more than a bit of real danger.The result is an animated film that is a visual joy for youngsters, and a guilty pleasure for their parents.If you don't have a kid, but luv great animated films...treat yourself to ""Alice In Wonderland"" anyway."
5,Duet weekend,One for the kids and one for the adults. The first Alice in Wonderland was of the younger girl and the Johny Depp is of the older girl and more for adults.
5,Better than ever,"Disney gave this one the royal treatment of restoration, excellent audio and even better video. I grew up on this and now so are my children."
3,Still kind of cute,"I got this for my five year old daughter, who watched it a couple of times. It is still a nice movie, but she was really interested in the new Tim Burton film. The cartoon may be best for the youngest, but the newer version is what she want to watch."
3,For my wife.,"I was going with a bit of an Alice in Wonderland theme for my wife for Christmas, so of course I had to get this movie.We haven't watched the special features, but my daughter was captivated by the show itself."
4,Scolding the Snakes breathes life into childrens sermons,"Ruth Gilmore does a marvelous job in her first book of breathing life into childrens. More than just a pedantic look at the Gospel of Luke, she takes us into the world of children and helps us dream as they dream. Ruth, from her writing, seems to have a bit of the child in her and thus does a fabulous job of connecting stories from today with the Gospel narative. Silliness, fun and a deep relationship with Jesus all come together in these sermons. This book is a must for anyone trying to reach young people with the important message of adundant life in Jesus."
2,Why buy this,Why buy this album when blink already put out a better greatest hits album entitled The Mark Tom and Travis Show
5,A Must See,"Cool Runnings is a classic movie from the 90s that will keep you laughing, is appropriate for children, and has a great story line. I recommend it highly."
4,Fun Family Movie,This was our first experience with Amazon Instant Video and we would recommend it to anyone. The movie was fun and family-friendly and streamed seamlessly from the internet.
5,Console Candy Fans & re-release a special edition loaded with extras NOW!,"This is a warm-hearted, touching movie with a solid John Candy performance. The world ended for me in 1994 when Candy died. Give us Candy fans a little something and re-release this - dare I say - family film - with loads of extras, deleted scenes, outtakes, commentary, documentary - PLEASE!"
4,A Gem of a Movie!,"Cool Runnings is a fast paced, well-filmed movie with just enough action to keep you entertained and just enough sentiment without being syrupy.The required profanity to get the coveted PG rating will offend only the most prudish. John Candy never picked his movies carefully, but he hit on a good one for him here. This is Rocky I without the blood and melodrama, a root for the underdog movie that doesn't leave you feeling cheated in the end or ashamed you actually sat through a movie with a preschool plot.The bobsled scenes are exciting and colorful. Buy this movie for a family night where mom and the kids will laugh and cry and dad won't doze off."
4,Very Entertaining!,"Excellent movie based on a true story about a group of Jamaican athletes who come together under difficult circumstances to compete in the olympics as a bobsled team! Very humorous, good comedy with very good acting. They picked all the right actors for each character. There are obstacles to overcome amongst themselves, in addition to external forces. You will applaud the ending!"
3,"Good for the price ($79), but nothing great.","Looks good, reasonably sized and feels heavy (if you like heavy watches). You will need to update the time and date if kept idle for more than 24 hours. In fact there is nothing great about this watch. The yellow dial essentially looks silly once the wow factor is gone. It doesn't keep accurate time as well. As another reviewer mentioned days are displayed in English and French, but then if you adjust correctly only English will be shown.It certainly is cheap for $79 but probably only worth that much given the movement and materials used."
5,TWO MOON JUNCTION - PURELY SEXUAL!,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST EROTIC SOUNDTRACK I HAVE EVER HEARD, EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM YOU'LL LOVE THE SENSUALITY OF THE MUSIC. JONATHAN ELIAS IS A GENIUS, KNOWING EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE TO CHURN YOUR STOMACH WITH EVERY SOUND! THE MAIN THEME 'WATER DREAMS' IS AMAZING AND IT'S WORTH BUYING THE SOUNDTRACK JUST TO HEAR THAT ONE TRACK! YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
3,Very sexy.,"Personally I thought this was a great movie, and not just because of Sherylin Fenn. The music is as erotic as the film. In short it's a nice instrumental bunch of songs, but how could it not end with ""Man With A Gun"" from Jerry Harrison (Talking Heads)? The song played over the credits, but I watched the credits three times just to listen to the song. I'll guess I'll have to search out his ""Casual Gods"" album."
4,This is a wonderful book!,"This story of Martha is inspiring to any Christian woman! It not only shows her great faith and how she followed Jesus, but the everyday struggles that women still face in their faith today. It was AWESOME!"
5,Great western!,This is one of the best action adventure books I have ever read. The story takes off from page one and the action never stops. I think the Texas Rangers are great.
5,Best game,Our daughter loves her game. Her and her friends get together with their guitars and play and dance for hours.
3,Time Killer,It's not the greatest game ever but it help kills time when you have nothing else to do.
4,Rocking Fun,"I have played the Japanese game Guitar Freaks, but I think Guitar Hero is much better. This game is definietly fun!!! You can quickly learn easy mode, but other modes will be a challenge. The guitar is very nice too. The only thing that bugged me was the notes you have to play scroll on the screen pretty fast and give little time for you to think and the background behind the notes sometimes made them hard to see. More practice with the game most likely overcomes this minor problem. I recommend this game!"
3,An average book about books,This was a mixed-bag assortment of essays on the pleasures of reading that varied in quality from stale and meaningless to the occasional brilliant nugget that ultimately made the entire experience worthwhile.
3,hold on,"a great ride, but Sheen seems misplaced in this one. Nastassja Kinski has never been sexier and awesomer. thrilling and action packed. the end with the windmills is the higlighted showdown"
3,1970 Challenger R/T,"A decent movie ; best part is that the director, D. Sarafian, has Sheen drive a white, 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T as a inside joke or a tribute to Richard Sarafian (dad? uncle? whatever) who directed the classic, Vanishing Point which had, as one? the? star a 1970 white Dodge Challenger R/T. As in Vanishing Point, car gets totaled...nice touch after 25 or so years."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!,"I bought this DVD and tried to view it tonight. Turns out, these DVDs are coded for a different ""region"" and you cannot view them on a regular DVD player. I play every other DVD I have ever bought just fine on my DVD player, this is the first time I have ever had this problem. Disappointing."
5,Total Movie Fan (1217),"This movie TOTALLY ROCKS! It's funny and quirky, and gives you an important messege: BE WHO YOU ARE. It's totally worth your [money]! This is not all I have to say, but there are not enough words to tell you how great this movie is!"
4,A Fun and Funny Movie!,"This must be one of the many movies that I'll want to see over and over again. Both Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow give Excellent comedic performances! One that shouldn't be missed. A great movie that will make you laugh all the way, till the end! The dancing in the reunion made me laugh so much, with ""Time After Time"" by Cindy Lauper being played, which was one of the best parts, that made me love this movie even more! You wont be dissapointed."
4,A Great Script & Superb Acting Put This Film Above the Rest!,"There are so many suspense/thrillers out there, and many of them follow the same dull routine. I am happy to say I have found one that stands above the rest. ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" is an outstanding example of how a good thriller should be executed. I cannot say it is extremely scary because it is not. But, the suspense builds up slowly, then explodes in your face. A great film (along with 'Fatal Attraction' & 'Basic Instinct') that is really the perfect model for all thrillers to come!"
4,suspenceful and exciting thriller,this is a film that will hold your interest from start to finish. It is one of the better thrillers out today. definately one of the best films of 1992 or the 90s.
5,Nanny from hell :-l,"What a stunningly creepy movie this is. I still love it after all this time and go back to it every now and then to re-creep myself out. It always gives me chills. Rebecca does a good job at playing the evil nanny Peyton - almost like the role was made for her alone. She is a widow who lost her husband to suicide and an unborn child to a miscarriage. Hence, the anger in her (and vengence).This is a solid movie with a great cast (and a fantastic Julianne Moore) and while it's predictable, it also has a sense of realism. I really enjoy it and still love watching it. I hope you will as well, especially if you like really good thrillers. This can't be beat."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Death of Groo is a case of mistaken identity. It is no big surprise that a town really, really doesn't like Groo, and when is dead, it is basically time for a party.Poor Groo's feelings are hurt, and he tries to work out how he can do good and be friends again."
2,Not at all worth it,"I dye my hair very black. It is so aggravating when the roots start coming in and the mascara trick isn't really a good solution. I saw a commercial for some other version of this product and decided to test it out.Not. Worth. It. One of those ""from far away fine, up close not so much"" products. Unless you want the world to keep its distance stay away from this product. Color is also dull, and never blends in right."
3,Marine Communications,"These headsets are used on a diesel trawler to assist in communications between the helmsman and deck person while docking. The headsets work well, but often pick up radio stations as background noise. They are not used as a toy."
5,Loved it,"This was a great, very well-written book. I stayed up late to read it, and woke up early to finish it before work. I can think of no better praise than that. Thanks to the author; whom I hope will continue to write."
4,Great Argentine movie,"A powerful movie, with interesting, though not very likable characters and strong situations. The plot has many twists that require close attention. Some scenes are not for the faint of heart. The acting is excellent. Those who have seen ""The secret in your eyes"" and liked the main actor's performance will also appreciate it in this movie."
5,Good product.,"If you are taking L-Arginine I recommend buying the 2.2 pound tub 1 Kilo size. It saves money and the powder is much more potent than the pills, and this size will last about 6 months."
2,works but gave up due to taste,"I was able to get it down, finally mixing with coffee. It tasted like the water must taste in the back of an air conditioner. Indescribable, half-organic, half chemical, reminded me of the smell on the Jersey Turnpike around the refineries and garbage dumps. Worse. It did give energy which might have been the famous arterial dilation effect. A friend of mine, a nurse with strong stomach, finally returned what I loaned her to try, saying it just non-consumable. I switched to Swanson's Arginine-AKG lemon-flavored powder, which I can easily drink."
2,I almost puked after the first taste,"Honestly, I ignored other ppl comments in regards to the taste. I've taken many supplements, and I think (most) people are just fussy when they say they dont' like the tasts of stuff such as gu energy gel or whey protien. Well, this stuff is horrible! I sipped some and almost puked all over my desk at work! You can mask it with lemon juice.I can't say much about the results since I just started taking it - but from the research I looked into, this can benefit. I mean, lots of protein and water is 95% of diet...so I doubt I'll be buying this stuff again. I'll be lucky to finish this order since it tastes so bad."
3,"Dubious results, horrible taste","I gave this product three stars and not one merely because it was delivered as promised and the product was of high quality. That being said, l-arginine doesn't do much. Its supposed effects are minor and studies show NO production is better manipulated with citrulline mallate. This product tastes TERRIBLE. I thouight I'd be able to bear it. As soon as I took a sip of it dissolved in water, I barfed my brains out. I haven't puked in 4 years, stomach viruses exempt.Awful, awful, awful taste."
3,Works but the taste!,"The product is a good economic source of L-Arginine. You will notice within 2 days a meaningful change in bloodflow and pump while working out. I take the product in the morning on an empty stomach in as little ice cold water as possible. This way it goes down in one gulp. The taste is the most aweful thing I have ever tasted. It is so bad that, some mornings, my stomach gets sick just thinking about it.You need to decide how bad you want the performance and effect."
4,East to put L'Arginine in capsules,"The capsule machine for filling ""00"" capsules works well. Fill capsules with L'Arginineand take 9 ""00"" capsules a day. I measured the powder and that is about 2 tsp.No bad taste that way."
1,"Took this for energy, I didn't notice any difference.","I have also tried Super B anti - stress complex, 5000 mg b-12, 5000 mg vitamin c, co - Q10, saw palmetto, Ginza-plus, testo-rex, D3, vitamin A, Bee Pollen, royal jelly, wheat grass juice, several teas, tested for low iron / diabetes, iron, niacin, vibe energy, emerin-c energy, soy energy drinks, multi-vitamins, magnesium, alot of teas, adrenal, nothing has worked. any suggestions..."
4,Had my kids jumping on the couch,My kids (4 and 7) liked this one so much during the racing scenes they got involved by jumping up and down on the couch. I'd say it entertained them they way it did me when I was their age. It will provide you with 60+ minutes fo free time....
4,HERBIE,"I like to have movies like this around so that if I have company that have children, it is there for them so we can visit peacefully."
3,This licorice may be bad for your health!!,I purchased this black licorice for my brother. He really enjoyed eating this real licorice but he experienced rapid heart beats and sweats. He stopped eating the licorice and his health went back to normal.
1,Truly awful,Why is this book written as if the author had a direct line to Gram Parsons' thoughts and feelings? Why does she feel the need to fill in the gaps with happy little thoughts and asides? It's truly dreadful. Interviews with too many obscure musicians/fringe dwellers. Opinions from people whose opinions no-one is interested in. I actually bought this book for the photos - and was extremely disappointed. The poor quality reproduction of the photos makes most of them impossible to distinguish who's who! A waste of time and money.
1,since when did wesley and woody become lovers?,take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie.
2,big booboo,"when i bought it i thought it was made by Electrolux - not anymore. Now made by Eureka and has broken down after only 2 years. When it works, it's great - but the repairman said, not being a real Electrolux, it's got a lot of defects.don't recommend"
5,Great family movie,"This is a great movie for the family, especially ages 4-6. There are a few incidents of name calling, but overall there is a lot of entertaining interaction between the animals. The story is a remake of Disney's original ""Incredible Journey"" with an update for modern times. There is a fair amount of low intensity suspense and narrow escapes, but nothing that would be too scary for a young child. The ending is enough to bring tears to your eyes. My family thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone."
4,Food for thought in so many areas.,"Whether or not you support the decisions made by the author, the true social scientist will love the controversy it will stir inside you. After reading this book I had to read ""Moira"" by Dr. Obler."
1,When the shrink is crazier than the serial killer,"The only thing I could conclude after reading this book was that they say truth is stranger than fiction, but, in some cases, truth is more stupid than fiction! Did Dr. Obler ever hear of an anonymous tip to police? Did he ever consider that the ""privilege"" he had with the killer did not extend to his family and friends who were also being tormented? How naive and arrogant can Dr. Obler be to even think that he has ""cured"" a serial killer? Just ludicrous!Having worked with violent crime victims for years, I can only say that instead of being praised for his ethical behavior, Dr. Obler should be shunned for his utter disregard for humanity."
1,The contents of this book are extremely disturbing.,"As a person with a Master's Degree in Forensic Psychology, and who has worked with several violent offenders, I am greatly disturbed by Dr. Obler's book. His ultimate decision to sacrifice innocent victims rather than risk his career is morally reprehensible. Certainly it is more repugnant to allow a murderous psychopath to remain in sociey than to break doctor-patient confidentiality. My suggestion to Dr. Obler would be to research the Tarasoff case, where the Supreme Court ruled that if a therapist reasonably believes or should have reasonably believed that the patient is going to kill someone, he/she has a DUTY to report what the patient has discussed with him or her.My hope is that this story was just sensationalized for publication. If this is the standard moral caliber of forensic psychologists, who make decisions regarding whether a person is dangerous to society, I think I might consider pursuing another career."
5,Awesome game,"My kids loved this game. They especially loved trying to beat their dad!!! We loved the metal ships and dubloons as well as the jewels (all seemed very durable for kids). It's fun to have a game with unique game pieces. The pirate flag was also the most coveted piece in the game (although I can see this being the least durable and first broken piece if you're not extremely careful) A fun family game that requires strategy and thought. Beware though it does bring out the true pirate, competitive spirit in your family :-)."
3,Step Aerobics with a Caribbean Flair,"I bought this tape years ago because I love step aerobics and enjoyed David Grays ""Funk Factor"" video. This workout is easy to follow for the experienced stepper. The music makes it fun, and David introduces some interesting choreography! The main problem is the lack of a proper cooldown stretch at the end of the workout. Basicly, this is a fun workout on easy days."
2,Mediocre,"I don't think this product works very well. Then again, I have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies. So maybe it is just me. I found these to be mildly relaxing but not necessarily sleep inducing. Also you have to take several -- four -- and the pills are large. I wouldn't buy again."
4,They work. But I noticed a hangover,"They work. But I noticed a hangover in the form of a withdrawal effect the next morning. I'm extra sensitive to GABAergics though, and this product has loads of them. Which may or may not be such a potential ""bad thing""."
4,"With this release, he could shed his label as the consummate sideman","Gurf Morlix, the man behind the magic curtain on so many other artists' recordings, steps forth to center stage on his fourth solo release, ""Diamonds and Dust."" He fixes his gaze squarely on mortality, loss, and life's travails. Yet he somehow keeps from spiraling into darkness by offering a few deft touches of humor and wit, leaving the door to hope and salvation open just enough to let some light through.Some recordings require a bit of work before they yield their rewards, and this one follows suit. Mr. Morlix plays guitar with a measured excellence, shirking the flourishes he could easily have added to focus on a more stripped-down, rootsy sound. Rick Richards great drumming keeps things moving, and the complimentary vocals from Patty Griffin offset the dry rasp the Mr. Morlix voices here.With this release, Mr. Morlix could shed his label as the consummate sideman, but I suspect he will keep on doing things at his own pace."
4,Gurf Morlix : Diamonds To Dust,"This is the first I have heard of Gurf Morlix, and I have to say I do like his music. It is not ""run of the mill"" How refreshing. I will be buying more of his cd's."
1,Close but....,"Sometimes new agers like to take someone's work and usurp it for their own purposes such as ""creatrix"". Blessed Hildegard was a CATHOLIC; You can't take the fun mysticism and spiritual gifts and leave out the belief system. The belief system Hildegard literally espoused includes Jesus Christ as revealed in Holy Scripture and Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus, declared several times Ex Cathedra. I suggest you find a translator who preserves Blessed Hildegard's Catholicism and get the true perspective."
3,Good for beginners,This book was good if you have never worked with dogs before. I was looking for something more advanced.
1,Take control of your life,"After buying, reading and finally discarting a ton of books on Astrology, card and hand reading, Nostradamus, you-name-it: the best way to take control of your life is to steer away from this kind of quackery. There is no such thing as destiny. If you believe in destiny and it being writen somewhere and predictable you'll live a slave of such archaic notion and people like these.If Grant Lewi has ANY proof that there is any truth to Astrology, he should contact James Randi and claim his $1 million prize. It should be so easy. One has to wonder why hasn't he done so already..."
3,An above average werewolf novel,"Moondeath, Rick Hautala's first published horror novel, centers around a small town that is slowing seeing its population decreasing. The main character guesses the origin of the creature, but is unable to convince the longtime citizens. The town always reports the deaths to the media in a way that makes no mention of animal attacks. The conclusion is a little weak, especially after the long buildup.Although predictable, the novel is still entertaining. Hautala's style is very smooth and the novel is an easy read. This is not his best work, nor the one for which he is best known. If you can locate a copy, read ""Little Brothers"". Others which I highly recommend are ""Night Stone"" and ""Moon Walker"". While long out-of-print, it's worth the effort to try to locate a copy of each."
4,Solid reference,"This book is a solid reference and a must have for those who plan on embarking on the road to becoming a Christmas Tree farmer. Well laid out and clear. Regardless of the topic, all relevant even today."
2,leather skirt,"To his credit, the person in charge of shipping maybe the owner? was on point and called when the package was returned from the post office. He made sure to let me know if there was a problem I should let him know.My problem is with the product. It runs small, a medium size did not fit my size 6 figure, and it isn't nicely tailored, I expected a finer quality for the price."
5,Perfect!,"This hot water bottle and cover are GREAT! I really like to use hot water bottles to keep me warm and to ward off cramps. Unfortunately, often times the bottles WREAK of rubber - to the extent I'd get headaches. Anyway, this bottle has no smell at all! Plus, the cover is trés cute and soft. A great buy all around."
5,Loved it,"I've read all of the reviews on SA2 and it is quite obvious this movie is not for everyone, however, if you enjoy ""feel good "" movies , this is for you. The storyline iis quite predictable, the acting is good , but the music is a delightful bonus,just wish there was more of it. I know that if I'm feeling a little down, I can pop in this movie and feel better."
4,TOP MOVIE,"You can't go wrong with this movie, funny, entertaining and well who doesn't like Woopy? Totally recommend it!"
5,TWO IS BETTER,SISTER ACT 2 IS MORE THAN JUST A MOVIE. IT'S IT'S FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. I BROUGHT IT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND & SHE LOVES TO SING ALONG WITH THE MOVIE. AND SHE KNOWS EVERY SONG FROM THE MOVIE BY HARD
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"While the content of this movie may indeed by harmless, it is also hopelessly predictable and boring. I don't think it would have been possible for the producers to have stuffed one more tired-out cliche into this movie. The only reason I kept watching after the first 1/2 hour was to hear the singing, and in the end I'm sorry I did. Save two hours of your life and don't bother with this mind-numbing film."
3,Good Premise,"Brown's book undertakes an important analysis of gang literature and representation, but the use of the concept ""gang nation"" is, in my opinion, questionable. For a more grounded account of gangs, I recommend that people read this book along side Miranda's Homegirls in the Public Sphere, Kontos' Gangs and Society, and work by Vigil and Moore. Good work overall!"
2,horrible running form!,"you would think a film about running you might see a body double from a distance showing a decent form vs the coach telling him to use his ARMS??? wth...economy of movement to extend energy profile always the goal but guess we are sposed to keep thinking of bench pressing with Jennifer and thou pious one for ways to suffer in prayer...ack Loved the forest treks, Ralph is adorable, glad mommy woke up but just too many contrived characters, plot, emotional manipulation, came rather close to a true story, did they divert us to remind one that fiction is greater than semi-facts... Can't wait for the Saint Ralph: OLYMPIAN!!! who has to die for that one??? lol"
1,did not work for 60cxs as stated,"I put in that I was looking for accessories for the older 60cxs and got this and the belt clip. neither use the screw on the back, seems to slide into something.. was able to use part of the belt clip to replace the broken one that came with the unit"
5,One of the great debuts of our time.,"On the short list that includes first albums by The Pretenders, The Cars, The Clash, and Elvis Costello goes ""Boy""Here we find a group with their own voice, their own style, their own sound that sounds like nothing on the radio at the time, yet spawns hundreds if not thousands of imitators.Like almost everybody has said, it is kinda like a concept album, but not in any sort of negative way. The songs sound just like they belong together...like they're part of a whole.You can sense an over-reaching ambition right from the start. In fact, objectively this is probably a ""four-star"" record, but ya GOTTA give them the extra star for the balls. They're clearly trying to be the biggest band in the world from the get-go. And within half a decade, they were.They've created one of the few rock careers where their entire output merits listening."
4,A Glimpse Into Greatness,"I have always been a fan of U2 but had little time to go through their discography.Between work and school I missed all the great tours they had previously, too.So, now that I am in my 30s, I am going back through all their albums, DVDs, compilations, etc.I cannot lie. I would have bought this for ""I Will Follow"" alone. I only recently found out this song was inspired by Bono's mother. Now I hear the nuances I missed after first hearing many years ago on the radio.You can tell already that The Edge was the genius guitarist everyone says he was. And now that I know so much about Irish/Celtic folk, classical, etc music I can hear the melodies in it so much more clearly.Also, Mr. Mullen's drumming shows his ""zen"" kind of style, even at this point....worth every penny..."
4,mystical,"When I first heard this album, I was blown away. It was exactly what I had always been wanting to hear, but had never heard, in rock music. Subsequently, I was an exclusively loyal fan for about 5 years thereafter. With all it's reverb and echo, the music transported me to a different world - a world only 4 kids from Dublin, Ireland could take me. I always realized these people didn't know anything about music theory or how to play their instruments, but combined w/Bono's strong voice, they pulled it off, anyhow. If you're a U2 fan and have never heard this CD, you're missing out."
4,A Strong Debut,"""Boy"" is one of the most impressive debut albums in the history of rock. The sound of this album was essentially unanticipated; at a stroke, U2 had achieved a unique style that would remain theirs throughout their long career. This is largely due to the contribution of the Edge; he was and is one of rock's most inventive guitarists. Bono has yet to achieve maturity as a singer and songwriter, but he is certainly full of youthful enthusiasm. The individual songs here are not really what is important - what give this album its vitality was its spirit of discovery. Here was something truly new."
5,Perfect Fit,"This product covers our Dodge Ram truck dashboard perfectly! Color matches the interior too. Thin and lightweight, it's easy to clean and remove if needed. Excellent, inexpensive solution for an ugly, cracked dashboard."
4,"Using it, like it, recommend it.","Easy to grind, easy to know when to add, gears are up in the rest position - less messy. A bit not easy to open the cover when I need to add some corns."
3,Good story,Good read and interesting story. I look forward to other books from this author as the stories move along well and keep you interested.
2,Secret Santions,"This ""story"" is about an investigation concerning a supposed atrocity in Bosnia. An Army JAG is heading the investigation assisted by two othr JAG's, they are challenged to find the truth in a convuluted coverup. However, I found it difficult to believe that Brian Haig a former Army officer could make so many mistakes about the military. Haig needs either a better memory or a better editor. Special Forces teams are made up of 12 men (not 9) the Specialist Seventh was impossible (and the Army has not had a rank above Specialis Four since 1985) there is no GS 17 rank and it goes on and on...Haig should be ashamed of himself to write such thrash. Yes, I am partial to the military. My husband is a retired Colonel, my daughter is an active duty JAG and my grandson is an active duty PFC....so I do have a working knowledge of the Army.....Save your money unless you are looking for a good laugh."
1,A Great First Try,"ALthough this is Haig's first, it is a good one. A page turner that moves very well. Lets hope he has some more in him."
5,Great Item!,I was very pleased to use the shoes when it arrived after only five days on Free Shipping! It fits fine and very nice to work around. It really helps me with my work.
5,One of MY favorite cookbooks.........and I just got it!!!!,"I would give it 10 stars if I could. I recently purchased this book on a recommendation from a friend and have already tried out 3 of the recipes on my friends, they keep begging to come back to dinner. I can't wait to prepare some of these recipes over the Holidays. The Chicken Rolls are my favorite so far. The recipes are easy to read and easy to follow and I plan on using it to try out some new recipes for Thanksgiving and then Christmas.I plan on buying one for my mother and for one of my friends who is a Chef, She'll love it!! I'm so glad I bought this cookbook."
3,"Nice sunglasses, but will break after 6 - 9 months of use","I like the glasses as they softly grip your head. Don't have to worry about perspiring and having them fall off as you bend down, or swing at a golf ball. They have one terrible weakness, the connections between the nose piece and ear pieces to the lenses. These connection points break down and have to be sent to the shop for repair. I wish these were more sturdy given their titanium structure, but they are not."
4,Alls well that ends well,"The computer is great, a little scratches and well loved looking, but works well. 5 Stars Electronics was the vendor I purchased with. The laptop I received had half the memory and half the HD space as listed and when I emailed 5 Stars they initially said some line about it being my part to do due diligence in assuring my product choice, but I provided screen shots of my order confirmation and they really went out of their way to take care of the issue. It took a little longer to get because I had to ship it back to them, but they reimbursed the shipping and what really impressed me was that they doubled the HD to 80 gigs. I am happy with the laptop and the vendor."
4,Needs material the clasp is attached to changed!,"The material that the clasp is attached to is too smooth like satin so the adjuster slides after some wear. I tied mine in a knot where I wanted it to stay. Works great, but manufacturer should change the, material. Would not be a good choice in Veterinary practices because it comes loose too easily and would put people in danger."
3,it's ok,"the book is ok, it was published in 1991 so it's not very up to date...it's written like a very boring textbook. not for people who are visual learners. it's good for referencing though"
3,"The facts ma'm, just the facts.","Yup, this is a nice, basic book for learning how to read a schematic. If you intend on working with electricity and will need to read schematics then this is where to start."
2,Only helpful for complete beginners but may confuse some,"If you have absolutely no experience reading schematics this book will help you some. I got it because I have a basic understanding but wanted to brush up and improve my reading skills. The book was of no real help and I stopped reading it halfway through. They show you symbols but give no real explanation of how the acutal equipment functions in the circuit. The author also does a poor job of going trough the paths of more complicated circuits. There is also a full chapter explanation of ""symbology"" that tries to turn into some sort of sociology/linguistics lecture. Totally unhelpful except in the most basic way. He tried to make a book for the beginner but didn't include enough theory to make the material make sense."
4,sexy interview,I watched this DVD with interest and found that the two guys were very honest and devoyed to each other. I had noy previously viewed a video like this but enjoyedit. As for the other videos that are done by same director they too were of very similar content and also found them to be very well made and produced. I recomend all of these movies. Very erotic.
1,Nothing to recommend,"This DVD sat in my Saved Items list for over a year, until the price dropped enough to make it worth the risk. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, but how was I to know? There just is not anything about this movie to recommend. Damon and Hunter are not interesting at all, there is no discernible affection between them, and they are a lot less attractive than they look on the DVD cover. The blurb on the back calls them ""rising adult stars,"" but if so I fear their stars will not rise much farther than this. If I'd wanted to watch boring, shallow, unattractive men have sex I could have done that online for free."
2,Remembering Sophie Tucker But Not Accurately,Pat Yankee has long been a great singer of traditional jazz but this CD is a misfire. Her script is filled with errors and she has chosen to approximate the Tucker voice of the 1950s and 1960s to perform the entire tribute. I expected to be delighted with this CD because Pat Yankee is a terrific performer. Keep listening to Sophie Tucker herself who never disappoints.
5,A Passover Haggada that resonates personally,"This Haggada is perfect for study before the Passover Seder, it also serves as a great guide during the Passover Seder. Obviously, the amount of preparation you do before the Seder will affect the kind of Seder you have. This book is self contained and probably has all the details you may need to co-ordinate the halachic and historic aspects of the Seder. The author shows the ability to explain deep concepts in a way that most people would be able to relate to."
4,"Some really good scenes, & very entertaining","This has a lot of fantastic visuals and some really good action in places. Very impressive, great adaptation.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
1,Go Dustin Hoffman!,"Yes, mumbling in a corner takes some sheer acting ability. No, visual style means nothing if your story is an agglomerated mess of fecal matter. And why all the retarded, down sydrome cardboard villians? And could Tracy be an even more boring character? Is he cool and interesting in anyway possible? ""But, I like the colors!"" Yeah, you would, how bout you try something with substance for a change."
3,Just a movie,"I don't like this kind of movies. Just bought it because I wanted to see Madonna. he is not the best actress, but I love the ways she sings!"
3,Adults will enjoy it more than children,"I remember going to see this film when it first came out. I was about 10 at the time and I absolutely hated it!! The plot was to complicated and there was precious little in the way of action to compensate the tedious plot. I saw it again 7 years later and enjoyed it better. The production design was brio as was the make up and the aray of cartoon performances from veterans like Beatty, Pacino and Hoffman. It's still not brilliant but now that I alot older I was able to appreciate the sort of things that you just don't notice when you're a child."
3,Missing minutes,"WhenI saw this film in the theater it was a longer version than the 105 minute DVD. At least one song -Hanky Panky- was cut, and the movie was toned down in adult content to a more general audience rating. Unfortunately, a lot of the plot vanished with the missing scenes. The movie is still OK, but it was better, and it is a shame to lose any of the music."
3,beautiful set decoration with bad script,"I watched this movie about two months ago and I only enjoyedAl Pacino in it,he was superb in this movie and very funnyunder the heavy makeup.About Madonna and Warren Beaty IDidn't like their acting and i'm still not a big fan forthe both of them.The soundtrack of the movie is boring[The worst songs of Madonna].Except the set decoration,the wonderful makeup for the actors and the great actorAl Pacino there isn't any thing intersting in this trash.The script is awful and the main character played by WarrenBeaty is one the most boring characters in the history ofthe American cinema."
2,Valve falls out,"This is a nice cup...good handles and a nice size for my son's eleven-month-old hands. However, it does have one MAJOR drawback. The valves do not fit snugly. When my son bangs the cup on the table or even his leg, the valve falls out and milk can splash and POUR out of the cup. It is definitely not leak/spill proof. I have several of these cups and they all do the same thing. This is very unfortunate since I prefer everthing else about this cup over the other styles I have purchased to replace it. From what I have seen, all the Gerber cups seem to have this valve, so I would imagine even other styles of Gerber cups may have the same problem."
3,Destroyer Droid,"This action figure is not that great. It stands up, and it shoots missiles, but it just doesn't look all that authentic. It's legs won't bend enough, making it stand a little bit to tall. It looks thin and all around non-threatening. another thing is that it's guns are hard to fire, and they don't fire that far. Also, like most Droideka figures I've seen, it cannot roll up. I recommend the Star Wars Episode I Destroyer Droid action figure. It doesn't shoot or ball up, but it comes with a commtech chip and looks cooler."
1,worst film ever!!!,"I've never walked out on a movie before (especially with the prices charged today), but I was prepared to leave after the first five minutes of this stinker.I cannot impress upon people enough, how bad this movie really is. If you're in a movie store and desperate for a movie to hire, don't hire this one.The acting is bad, the script deplorable & the jokes just aren't there."
2,"Sorry, Spy Hard is a waste of time","I love Leslie Nielsen, but this movie is not funny. His better movies are Wrongfully Accused and the Naked Gun movies."
2,Spy Hard,"Well, you win some and you lose some. I was very disappointed that the Leslie Nielsen film was a total flop, because I really had high hopes for it, and now I'm broke because I was stupid enough to buy it instead of rent it. Agent WD40 Dick Steele must stop an old enemy from destroying his (deceased) girlfriends' daughter. With the help of his basically useless assistants, Nielsen bumbles his way and manages to save her. Funny parts and crude jokes are rare, and Neilsen isn't as stupid as usual. I don't really recommend this movie, even to diehard Leslie Neilsen fans. I am one myself, and I didn't like it. I recommend The Naked Gun series instead, some of Neilsen's better work."
5,SPY HARD MOVIE,THE MOVIE ARRIVED IN AWESOME SHAPE AND VERY FAST! VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE TIMING! THE MOVIE IS FUNNY AND PLAYS PERFECTLY CLEAR!
3,Good Imitation Of The Bond Films,"I liked this movie because of how it made fun of the Bond films. The beginning titles copied Thunderball. Instead of having slim women swimming around, it was a bunch of fat women. I just thought it was funny, ever since it first came out.A lot of people disagree with this movie, but I thought it was really good.Rent it if you think you should. It's up to you"
1,If only...,"If only...I had not seen ""Airplane!"" or any other movie that Leslie Nielsen was ever in. If only...the movie could have kept up with the high standard set by Weird Al's opening. If only...the script had been at all worthy of Leslie Nielsen's signature deadpan. The simple fact is that the film had ample opportunity to be funny, even hilarious, but the jokes are not even recycled, they directly lifted from other great movies. The simple thing is that Weird Al's parody represents the full extent of the creative humor in the film...buy it when it only costs as much as a music video. That's all you'll want to see."
3,not Leslie's best,"I was expecting a lot more from this movie. A lot of the jokes fall flat. Think of National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1. Although Spy Hard is not as horrible as that one, it still in no way measures up to the greatness of Airplane! or the Naked Gun movies. This movie is probably worth a rental from your local video store, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. The best part of this movie is the opening title sequence by Weird Al Yankovic. It spoofs the typical James Bond opening credit sequence. When I first saw that at the theater, I almost fell out of my seat from laughing so hard. The opening credits alone may be the best reason to see this movie. After that, it's a so-so movie with some funny parts but mostly gags that fall flat."
2,Technique without Soul,"As a jazz flute player myself, I listen to every jazz flute recording I can find. There aren't that many. Nestor Torres is a Puerto Rican native who relocated to Miami 25 years ago after studying in New York and Boston. He's one of those guys I'd like to like, but his music just doesn't do much for me. It's not lack of technique-he has plenty. His clean tone is straight out of the classical tradition, similar to fellow conservatory-trained jazzman Hubert Laws. While I prefer a grittier sound, I can enjoy such purity if the setting is right. But Torres' material leaves me flat; the pre-programmed arrangements he surrounds himself with are mechanical and boring. It's too bad. Torres says this album was inspired by 9/11 and by a lecture given by the Dalai Lama in Florida. I wish those events had sparked a more interesting musical response.Originally published in Port Folio Weekly, 4/11/06.copyright 2006 Port Folio Weekly. Used by Permission."
5,New Jack started with this album,"New jack started with this album. I don't even know where to start to explain how great this album is.....teddy riley is such a master of this genre and THE new jack swing pioneer of them all.Listening to this album brought back all the great memories of my childhood: just simple things like sitting on the backseat of a car with my nephew and friends while my uncle drove us to the beach, BBQ background music, summers at swimming pools and lakes while taking a cassetteplayer, mini boxes, and the actual cassette of guy of course, with me. Ahhh. That was nice. And now, after all those years, I finally had the opportunity to purchase this album and listen to it on my discman. I literally didn't hear all of them songs for oer 15 years!!!! And not even once it crossed my mind to check whether or not this cassette had been digitalized casu qua transferred to CD.....Hm, I could have enjoyed it sooner....Anyway, great stuff!!!!"
5,Good book easy read,"I read a lot on the the war on the Eastern Front, and this is a very objective book, that covers both the German and Soviet perspectives. The chapters are fairly short, which means you can not get bogged down on to much detail. Also I was amazed by all the new information I learned, especially about the partisan warfare, and how the climate of the Soviet Union affected both the German and Soviet armies. This is an extremely easy read, which the reader will find informative and very entertaining."
4,Good Read,"This book read like your typical romance novel. I found it to be very entertaining. However, I was irritated by the constant deluge of designer names to describe the clothing and shoes being worn by the characters. The ending tied together nicely as expected. If you are looking for high brow literature with complicated plots and subplots, you will not find that in this book. Yet, I found this book to be a good read that held my attention to the very end."
2,Broken Record...,"The author's points are valid. However, he takes 193 pages to say what could have been said in 40. The same points are covered over, over, and over again. This book was first published in 1930. I don't think it would make it to press today. Not that it's a bad or inaccurate book. It is just redundant to a fault."
5,Excellently visual reading experience,"This author is incredibly talented in bringing the Divine Sarah back to life with a power and passion that makes it difficult to put the book down. After reading this book, and listening to the musical masterpieces written specifically for Sarah, I can completely believe that she is the greatest classical performer the world has known. What she chose to do with her life is inspirational, and even more incredible considering that as a female in that point in time, her power should have been limited. Her type of art is no longer seen in this world, at least not in the US. Cornelia Otis is an amazingly visual author with the ability to suck you into Sarah Bernhardt's world, and I cant say enough, if you love art and strong beautiful females, this book is worth reading."
5,Transformed our bible study,This book has transformed our bible study. We have become a praying group and have seen God work in mighty ways through our lives.
3,just okay,"This is an okay carseat! It sits almost straight up when attached to the base in the car. Therefore, there isnt much support for your baby's head even when you use additional headrests. I agree with the others who have posted about the canopy. It is very loose and doesnt have much support. It does fit very well into the Vector Stroller though. I love the stroller but I would pass on the seat if I was shopping again."
2,Horrible,"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this car seat. It has a nice look, but very difficult to carry and get it into and out of my car. Getting the baby buckled in the seat is a nightmare. It's very difficult to latch the baby in. Also, the canopy shade is awful. There is nothing attaching the back part of it to the carseat, so on a breezy day, the back flies up and exposes the baby. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,THE WORST !!!!!!,We purchased this carseat when my second child was born. I would not recomend this to anyone!!! It is extremely heavy and awkward to carry. The straps are very difficult to adjust. It took us forever just to figure out how to adjust the straps and we are not idiots by far. I could barely carry my son in this seat because of how large and heavy it was. We returned it and purchased the graco snugride. WOW! what a difference! The last thing you need when you have a child is for anything to make your life more difficult. This carseat I believe should be recalled. Its just not safe. The straps came undone more than once without anyone adjusting them. I would go with the graco! It saved us alot of aggrvation and its alot less! Good luck to all!
2,Heavy with a tough buckle,"What got our attention for this car seat was the looks of this seat. But when we left the hospital and tried to put our 6 lb. 14 oz. daughter in the seat, we found it difficult. The biggest problem was trying to keep the buckle closed while trying to snap it without hurting her legs. Also, safety requirements say you can only leave room for one finger between the baby and the strap and we weren't able to do this due to the strap. We thought maybe we would eventually get used to some of these items, but our baby is now 7 weeks old and it is just as difficult and very frustrating. Even though our baby was very light, it was still hard to carry around the baby. My wife even threw her neck out getting the car seat in and out of the car and carrying it around. We learned our lesson about checking into products and reading reviews before we purchase an item."
2,These cant be right,"I'm not sure if this is for lead guitar, but the songs I do know how to play like Heart Shaped Box, is completely wrong. I tried playing it their way and sounds nothing like the song so I'm not even gonna try the other songs"
4,Good Support,"Have not worn it all day yet, but have tried it on and it feels comfortable and is a good support. Material feels good."
3,Good value,I gave birth a month ago and this belt has helped me recover faster. The material on the non-velcro side seems to stretch and lose its form. It's a good value but if you find an alternative I would recommend going for it.
4,Good but not the best,"It's hard enough to keep your belly pulled in but not inconvenient, I could actually sleep in it without a problem. The only problem I found with this belt is that the soft part (the one that attaches to velcro) creased up and since then (second day of use) started leaving marks on my belly. While I'm trying to get rid of my stretch marks, this belt is leaving different patterns on the abdomen :-) Overall, I would recommend buying it as it does it's job after all."
3,Disc is defective,"First play:At three places during the film it will freeze up momentarily and then cut minutes ahead. I then rewind to this location and am able to see all the minutes I missed except for roughly the minute at the location where it freezes up which is just unreadable no matter how many times I rewind to it. At the end of this cut up film I took the disc out and flipped it around; no marks, dust, dirt, smears, etc. Brand new. I have to assume I was sent a defective disc."
5,great movie,"I saw a midnight showing of this film in Providence while I was at Brown, and I'm very lucky because I probably never would have heard of it had I not been there for the weekend. (...)The film takes place during Vietnam and a big ban on the arts, causing Pitt and the twins to have constant arguements about these issues. Some very interesting points are brought up, and the three characters all learn about different sides of themselves. Throughout the movie, they learn about eachother's thoughts, (...), opiions, etc. It's a very interesting and well done film and I highly reccomend it to any cinema fan."
1,Hommage to Jean-Luc Godart,"It is incredible that twenty eight previous reviewers have not noticed that the entire film is an hommage to Jean-Luc Godart's 1967 La Chinoise, with Jean-Pierre Leaud (Truffaut's Antoine Doinel), and Juliet Berto.In fact, most of the scenes are actually shot in front of a contemporary poster of the film.The sounds of the ongoing street demonstrations coming from the window are invisible to the viewers, but the poster is constantly within view. To understand 1968 we are referred to La Chinoise.The world of La Chinoise is total confusion. The student protagonists are struggling to find a reason and a channel for their state of mind. What had started as rebellion became a cause not clearly determined. La Chinoise is about that search.What The Dreamers is about is not so clear."
2,disappointing,"The Dreamers gets 21/2 stars for cluttering the ending. The parents come home and find their naked boy-and-girl twins in a menage a trois in a makeshift desert tent in the girl's bedroom. The parents write a check and leave, the embarassed girl decides to commit suicide by gas, a rock comes through the window and the lovers join the mob on the street. Our hero says no violence and walks away, the twins are provoking the police with molotov cocktails, so we get a deus ex machina and a moral lesson in the last 7 minutes of the movie. Which is to say, 27 scenes of sex and old movies punctuated by gunshot. Well, that's more plot than Last Tango in Paris, which had no tear gas that I recall, only butter."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"Bertolucci is briliant as usual, as this film leaves plenty of mind candy to suck on. But the acting did not measure up.The two male lead performances were uninspiring. It seemed as though Michael Pitt was reading his script from the cue cards. I found that these lame duck performances dragged this film down a notch.The story is interesting, as an American student, studying abroad in Paris, hooks up with a brother and sister, who are movie buffs, as is he. They bond by acting out parts in movies, and passionatly arguing cinematic trivia, like Keaton vs. Chaplin. OUtside of their little world, Paris is being overtaken by revolution, and there are a million philosophical paths surrounding the revolution that this film takes. Sex is an intricate part, and is tied in well, it compliments the overall story.Again, this is worth viewing, but, I'd rather read the screenplay, because the acting leaves much to be desired."
1,The Dreamers,"Despite the mixed reviews the critics and other viewers may have given this movie, this is really pretty sick stuff, with little or no redeeming social context. Objectively, sick just isn't erotic, no matter how hard one may try to rationalize to make it so. Those who think differently really ought to either: (a) focus a little more; (b) examine their true motives; or (c) get a life."
4,Not all said up front,There are alot of things that are underneath the serface of this film. You might have to watch the film more than once to get it all. Things that have to obtained from the time and the charecters themselves.(I will not ruin them for you finding them is half the fun) The film is not one that you watch when you are bored with your buddys it is a film that takes all your attention to actually get it.The film ends with no changes in the people only an experience that changed their lives but could not change who they were nomatter how much they tried. I hate movies that charecters change because of an experience this movie seems real in that aspect because the people dont change. It is a little overthe top in certain aspects but it makes you think and is an enjoyable experience.
5,Dreaming about Dreamers,"I saw this film in the theatres about 5 months ago. The film was beautifully shot; with each frame rich with colors and depth. I remember the transitions were smooth and although the dialogue a bit cheezy but believable. I was seduced into this sensual world where there was no boundries of morality. Youth was in full bloom and the calories of virtues were being burned brightly. However, this fantasy existed within the confides of the apartment, protected from the the harsh reality of political instability and social normals. Although there are some people who claim that this film is only about sexuality and perverted incest, I think they missed the point of the film. Like when we watch films, we enter a world of fantasy, an escape from our pedestrian lives. When I saw this film, I forgot myself and became absorbed into this wonderful film. I adore this Bertolucci work."
4,Unusual,"Original movie, given to a friend for comment, awaiting reaction, he likes old films, and may get a kick out of this."
1,Nothing but pornography,I so appreciate the female actress in the Bond film with Craig. She made for a great villian/heroine. And the banter between the two was great. Loved it. And I am glad I saw her in that movie first. Because this movie was just disturbing. It was graphic. It was just porn trying to be art. And if you don't want to take my word for it seek out an interview she did where she was asked about this movie. She said she couldn't even watch herself on the screen.
5,None Dare Call It Treson,"After backstopping a great deal of the claims the author made, I verified that his information was spot on. The attempts of the the commielibs to disarm Americans currently, is directly attributed to the long-range plans of those that wish to destroy us."
1,"another trendy horror film, never saw one of those!","this movie is stupid, the ending is really dumb and happy, awwwwwe everybodies back to normal. the characters made toooooo many assumptions that for some wierd reason all turned out right. robert, the mexican director who only made 2 good films, ripped off The Thing(waaaay better than this) monsters big time, only instead of using guts and viens as limbs for cut off parts he chickened out and used tenicles. very dumb and NO GORE!! not a single decent hacking up scene, well, when was there ever a good gore scene in a trendy horror film?"
1,Do not waste your time...,"This movie is horrible from beginning to end. To anyone with half a brain: I recommend you do not see this movie. A mindless trip into teeny bopper land. The only reason to maybe watch, is to play the "" Let's see how many movies they ripped off"" game. It just goes to show how fast Hollywood is cranking out movies, and not checking the quality."
5,I liked it,"I had 3 chances to see this in the movie theater but I passed them up (as did most of my friends) because of the tommy hillfigure ads on TV featuring the actors from this movie. Plus it has Usher in it -- who I do not like, at all. About a week ago I was at a sleep over and we rented this film, I must admit it is a good movie. Despite it's selling out to Tommy Hillfigure, Pepsi, Apple Computers, and Adidas this movie has a good plot line. And on an even better note, Usher is bearly in this movie! It's a ""breakfast club"" for the 90s. If your a teenager, no matter how cynical you are, you'll like this movie... Trust me..."
4,A Superb Horror Movie - Guaranteed To Be A Classic!,"The movie The Faculty has to be one of my all time favorite horror movies. It has great acting, suprising twists and turns, and a great new cast.When the teachers and faculty at a high school start acting strange, start to believe the unbelievable...That their aliens!Led with a group of unlikely kids, (consisting of Jocks, Loners, Nerds, and Popular kids), must help rid their small town of aliens. Led with a new cast of Famke Jansen, Usher, Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and Jordana Brewster, this film is non stop fun from beining to end!DVD Special Features Included:&#65533; Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)&#65533; Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen&#65533; Theatrical trailer(s)&#65533; Widescreen letterbox format (2:35:1)"
5,GREAT MOVIE!! I LOVED IT!!,This movie kicks total but!! You have to get it today if you haven't saw it yet!! You wont be sorry! Josh Hartnett is sooooo hott in every scene!!!! I Love Him!! :o)
4,Was Suprised,"A hip horror/thriller with a who's who of young stars. Part Alien, part Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a bit of the Thing feeling to it sometimes, this movie works a lot more than it doesn't. It is smartly written and acted, so it doesn't feel like so many of the other teen horrors. Even the adult actors are all top notch. From Lilith on Cheers, to the evil cyborg in Terminator 2, all the way to Jon Stewart, this is an interesting film."
4,"""The only alien in this school is you""...","Every teen will love this movie. With extraterrestrial parasites taking over the teachers of a school, six teens discover the secret and must stop it before it's too late. There are very few lame scenes in this movie, and the action, the actors, and the screenplay make the storyline good and worth watching. Though there is a lot of advertising for Tommy Hilfiger, and most of the actors are new, they do a good job and the soundtrack is awesome. I must admit, even I was surprised to find out who the head alien was."
2,Not much to it,This film was very disappointing. It was very predictable and the suspense was mild. The cast of this movie was somewhat decent.
5,They try so hard its funny,When I saw this movie for the first time I was not scared at all or even thought that I should be I just enjoyed it. When I saw it again I realized that some people might find the movie stupid but I think it is funny. When you see the part where one of the teachers taken over by aliens head is cut off and it's running around looking for its body it is hilarious. If you are easily scared this movie will still be good but you will enjoy it differently than I did. If you are a Josh Hartnett fan you will be disappointed because this is not one of his better movies but on the plus side the ever-talented Elijah Wood does a wonderful job like always.
2,Not quite BODY SNACHERS,"A tepid moderatley fulfilling, guilty pleasure is all this very if-y Sci-fi/Horror film can be classified as. GUILTY PLEASURE! That may be good enough fo some but not for me. Now i admit the first time i saw this movie i liked it, but then i watched it again and i couldnt believe that such a high profile cast could do such an idiodic film. With fine special effects and fine acting, the fineness ends there and ridiculesness begins. A teen interpretation of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is an insult to such a classic horror film. Kevin Williamson tried to go a different direction with his writing, and he did-going down, anyone?"
4,Just as I remembered...,Just as I remembered...great and corny 90's scary movie. Good flick without all of the gore from today's scary movies; plus there are a lot of familiar actors in it.
4,FUN,The first time i saw this movie with my sister i loved this movie and when i found out it was on dvd i had to get it. This movie is one cool teenage flick. I dont think anyone over 21 will enjoy this movie and i dont know why major critics said it was ok. ITS A TEENAGE MOVIE MEANING ITS FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION TO ENJOY. IF YOUR A NORMAL YOUNG PERSON WHO HAS A DVD PLAYER BUY IT NOW!
5,A must see Thriller,"The Faculty is a must see! I can't stop watching it, I think I know every line in the movie!"
1,Read it and you won`t believe it!,"I think the theme of the book is quite unrealistic because I can`t believe that there are teachers who support students like LouAnne does! I`m not sure if there is any teacher in America who really wants to hug a pupil because students can misunderstand that , and so it would be dangerous for the teacher and he/she may get lots of problems. I`m also unhappy about the structure of the book because there are only short stories in it , and so it`s very confusing. All in all I want to say that I don`t like the book very much but it is much better than the film!"
2,Dangerous Minds,"I think this book was kinda broing and needs more detail. I thought it had no significant point, and i didnt care for the ending."
3,great,"Perfect book if you are thinking of going into teaching, or if you want to appreciate teachers more!! Read this in high school and wanted to read it again to appreciate what I do!"
3,Dangerous Minds,"The book ""Dangerous Minds"" by Louanne Johnson is about education and a teacher named Mrs. Johnson who helps troubled students. She tries so many things to get them to focus on graduuating and having a good future. I think that the book was O.K. I dont care to recommend it to anyone, but if you like what you see then pick up the book and try it."
3,I can't say a bad word about this book.,"I can't say a bad word about this book. Sometimes I really liked the way the teacher helps students, and sometimes it was just kind of boring and unrealistic. The other thing I liked was that every chapter was about different students and different problems. This kind of helps me to understand the problems which the teacher had with these students. Like I said before, in some ways it was unrealistic but I would like to have teachers like that in some of my classes. In comparing the book to the movie, the book carried more information about students and makes you visualize what it was like in Mrs. Johnson's class."
3,Childrens book? Its very diplomatic,The glossy pictures and year by year review is good. However I thought I wanted to buy an indepth tennis book. Anyone who is thinking in the same line may not try to buy this book.
5,A book not to be missing from the collection of fans!,"This is an impressive book on the history of the US Open. Full of highlight photos of players in action, this very comprehensive piece of writing on the the final Grand Slam tournament of the year will keep the reader's eyes glued to the pages. The year by year section on the Open is a great chronological collection of photos of the champions with annotations. The chapter on the great matches of the Open provides details of some of the historical moments of the tournament since the inception of the US Tennis Championships. A must-read for all tennis fans and players alike!"
5,If you like great movies go ahead and watch it.,You will probably cry but it's really really real real good. So that should even things out I guess. Thank you.
4,A great movie for everyone,"One of the best movies of the year 1987 was ""Death Poets Society"" by Peter Weir. This movie combines many different genres: One might laugh because there are parts of a comedy. There are also parts of a romance and you might even cry because of the tragic parts. This movie is special because it shows ideas of the Borque like ""Carpe diem"" (seize the day) and ""Memento mori"" (remember that you have to die) in a modern time. Ít moreover teaches people to think for themselves and should become free thinkers. It is timeless because the ides are both old and modern at the same time. But not just a good idea makes a good film, the great actors did a awesome job. I can just recomment this movie to everybody, it might even change your perspective of life."
2,Ordinary and dull,"Just a simple story , plus parents willing to see the best of everything in their children are shown exactly as 'monsters', rather than adults who could normally make mistakes as expected from human-beings. Also the teacher who acts in unusual ways is shown as a ''hero''. Simply the good versus the bad ! I do not condone pressure or do not blame 'different' types, however this movie is just ''the war between the extremists''."
3,Missed potential,"A beautifully shot film with some extraordinary acting by Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles. However, the script really gets too heavy-handed at times and Robin Williams' character lacks depth to understand his motivation in moving his students. Nevertheless, I get lost in Mr. Weir's recreation of a 1950's prep school where the pressure to conform breeds an unbearable yearning for intimacy and friendship"
3,"Plenty of potential, but...","...not enough bang for the buck. Robin Williams made a winning transition from comedy to drama in ""Dead Poets Society,"" but there simply isn't enough plot, nor enough interesting characters, to make this a good movie. At best, it is sadly average, given the potential of its above average cast.Still, there are winning moments, such as the now-famous ""Oh Captain, my captain"" desk-standing scene. I've heard some people comment that teachers like the one Williams portrays are better left out of the classroom. I would actually prefer to see more creativity like his brought into the schools. If only the writers and director had employed some of that creativity themselves..."
4,Great everyday perfume,I've been wanting to try the Azzaro Chrome for some time and the great price on Amazon was too tempting. And boy am I glad I did buy.. Its a great unobtrusive perfume which I plan to use on a daily basis
3,purchased for a Christmas present,"The Chrome came quickly and in pretty condition. My only complaint was that it claimed to be new, yet the plastic on the outside was missing and the box was banged up. That led me to wonder if it may have been used because it had obviously been opened before. Other then that it seems to be fine. I would more then likely buy from this company again, there prices were by far the best."
5,Chrome by Azzaro for men,This is my sons favorite cologne. So we bought him the big bottle for Christmas. He was thrilled. I am gladI found it at such a good price
1,Something not right,"While the 3.4 oz bottle of Chrome that I received appears to be in good condition and I do enjoy the way it smells, it does not seem right. I can apply several sprays of it and it still smells faint and it can't be smelled on me by others. The smells also fades very quickly and is about gone in a couple of hours. Dilute? Counterfeit? Defective? I don't know but I would not recommend purchasing Chrome from Amazon."
5,You are only cheating yourself if you don't add this to your collection.,"It's hot, it's cool, it's cajun, blues, soul, folk and country performed like no other can. Tab Benoit is a humble and unfortunately under-recognized artist who blinds you live and lights you up with his recordings. This is the kind of stuff we've been waiting for. No more bored musicians. Tab handles a guitar with the ease of SRV, the soul of Jimi and the heart of the Bayou."
1,"if looking for ideas, look elsewhere","I would say only the idea of abstraction is ""beatiful"" but the rest of the book is drivel. It tries to present profound ideas, but fails miserably for lack of lively content or perhaps the incompetence of the authors as teachers. Although I haven't looked, I'm sure there are plenty of better books on the art of programming. This one is just a waste of time no matter what your interests are."
1,"not too bad, but completely useless","This book is readable. I can't say it's fun or easy to understand, but a *few* concepts might seem interesting. However, the large majority of things introduced can't be applied. Streams, for example, are introduced to alleviate the bottlenecks created by Scheme in conjunction with poor code planning earlier in the book. They are completely irrelevant to languages like C/C++. The same with other things here. Mildly curious but nothing useful and certainly no profound theories, as some would have you believe."
1,Not terribly fun,"This book is a bad experience. The authors make no attempt to explain anything, but instead cram the book with many confusing concepts and without any teaching effort, try to make you see the ""beauty of it all"". This book should NOT be read by every self respecting programmer. It'll only be a waste of your time."
5,Fantastic Textbook,"I used this book to teach myself Scheme. It used to be offered at MIT as 6.001 but unfortunately they removed it in favor of 6.01 Python. Scheme is very much the ""Latin"" of programming languages: it's not extremely useful but it teaches you how to approach programming and how to think about it. Highly encouraged."
1,important concepts presented poorly,"I think you'll need a good prof. to learn anything from this book. If you like to learn on your own, you'll need to find better texts that this one. It's fairly dry/uninspiring and there's a lot of fluff mixed in with a bit of interesting material here and there. I didn't enjoy reading it at all."
1,"boring, dry, and devoid of useful information","The book never lives up to all the hype surrounding it. In fact, of the over 50 people I know who had the misfortune to study out of it, none liked it. I imagine only a few crazy souls who care about nothing but dry computer langague theory would even consider this worth reading.Recursion and information hiding via procedural/object code is nothing mysterious and is taught in all other CS classes, so the text adds nothing new. It merely retells the same old obvious programming techniques using a very poorly designed language (Scheme) and using completely uneducational examples. In short, this book is an overrated waste of time. If you are familiar with structured programming in a langauge like C++, you won't get anything new out of this. In fact, any topic presented here is better learned elsewhere, since the text is just one of those poorly written books that try to be encyclopedic at the expense of being interesting and thorough."
5,An adventure with sounds,Hear That? How many of us have played this game w/our child(ren)? Here is a new book that takes the journey to a really silly imaginative level. As a boy and his mom wait for dad to come home there are various sounds in the house. They each take turns figuring out what the sounds could be and make a great in house adventure out of it. From butlers to walruses in the fridge and slippery banana peels you will laugh and learn. The illustrator used a unique and wonderful technique to bring the story to life. This could possibly get a Caldicott for 2001 either winner or honor.Read this book.
3,Quick Shipping,"I cant really rate this item due to the fact that it does not work on my DVD player, it is not really the sellers fault as for the fact that I guess I did not really read all the details. I live in the us and I guess this type of DVD was not formatted for us players. The only thing I can say is the seller was fast at shipping, and to make sure you read all details."
5,SNOT FACE WAKE UP!!!!!!!,"I think Drop Dead Fred is the best movie in the world. It helped me through my troublesome childhood years. I had a friend like Fred once, but he was nasty and thought my mum was hot. He soon got rid of her cobwebs, i'll tell you that!I remember watching Fred for the first time, it was so much fun, he was great. I wish i'd have had someone to wipe snot on my face and walk dog poo through the house and make pants pie with. All it needs is a pair of dad's pants and VODKA! If i'd had Fred i would've kept him forever and ever, I LOVE HIM!"
1,drop dead fred from moviemars,The DVD I ordered - Drop Dead Fred supposedely sold as NEW - is BLANK!!! Not only did I get ripped off but there is NO CONTACT information for the site I ordered it from - moviemars. I want to return this bogus item and either get my money back or get what I ordered!!!!! I will be hard pressed before I EVER order from this site again.
3,Feel good fun,"DROP DEAD FRED is about a lady (Cates) who loses her husband and job in one day. When her mother (Mason) insists that she move back home with her, she calls on her imaginery friend (Mayell) to help her out of the troubled times. Drop Dead Fred is the name of the imaginery friend, and he is like a comfort zone for her, and borderline annoyance.WHat I like about DROP DEAD FRED is that it has a bit of everything - drama, comedy, romance. I enjoyed it after wanting to see it for many years. It is a tad dated, but that's ok.Enjoyable for a rent if anything. It's also a good film for kids too."
3,As described but not what i expected,Item was perfect but didn't know it wouldn't play in my dvd player so I'm stuck with a non working dvd :(
1,lied to,product does not play on any gaming systems and i have them all or any laptops or DVD or blue-ray DVD players
1,Drop Dead Fred very upset,"Movie will not work,something about international or something,very upset to wait 4 weeks and it wont work,also movie was out of box sliding around,always happy any other time,just not now,dont want to waste time sending it back so I guess Im out the money I spent."
1,Drop dead Fred (Region2),It stinks because I cannot watch it because it won't play in my dvd player. Very disappointed. Be careful what you order.
5,Best Movie Ever!!,"Drop Dead Fred is my favorite movie. I have watched it over 100 times, no lie.I this bust-out laughing everytime I watch it."
1,Drop Dead Fred Movie,Unfortunatley it is not formatted for USA cd players. It was my understanding this one was...what a waste! It was a christmas gift. Now to late to replace.
4,Cute story line,"The crow gets into many different senarios, fun stuff kids will love it. NO bad words or scary stuff, just good little short stories."
5,Great paring knife!,"I've had my set of Chicago Cutlery for 30 some years. Somehow my paring knife got lost. It is the little workhorse of my kitchen--we use it for everything and other paring knives are flimsy and dull. I can't live without my Chicago Cutlery paring knife and I'm so grateful that it was easy as click, click, click to replace."
5,Chicago Cutlery paring knife,"I really like this paring knife. It is the easiest paring knife to use because of the handle and angle of the knife blade. I have had one for over 20 years and I used it so much I decided to buy a few more. The original knife is still in excellent condition, only the wood part in a little faded. Wonderful knife."
4,Riotous,"As a big fan of Jack Webb and the 1960s Dragnet, Dan Aykroyd couldn't have parodied him better! I look at this as imitation being the sincerest form of flattery and I'm sure Webb would've appreciated it. I love it when Friday and Streebek (after wrecking multiple vehicles) get issued a Yugo ""on the cutting edge of Serbo-Croatian technology"". Hilarious!"
3,"dumb, da dumb dumb...","...but I still give it 3 stars 'cuz Dan Ackroyd's riffing is freaking hilarious, and that alone is worth checking out at least once. I can't defend the storyline 'cuz it IS pretty dumb, but I guess that's beside the point...it's all about the laughs, and Ackroyd & Hanks deliver for the most part..."
2,Not well suited for hard of hearing,"I got this for my dad who is hard of hearing. He had used TV Ears which worked well for a while but then died. These JVC headphones are comfortable and the sound qualify is good (better than the TV Ears) so probably would be good for use by those without hearing loss. BUT the maximum volume on these JVCs is too low. At max volume level the volume was good for me (no hearing loss) but no help for my dad. Also it's not easy to place the unit on the stand to engage the battery charger on the base unit. Headphones have to be placed with the correct orientation (charging port only on one side of the headphones) and correct angle. Finally, instructions say that batteries take 30 hours to fully charge and that you shouldn't recharge the batteries until they are depleted otherwise will shorten life. TV Ears could be placed on base for recharging anytime headphones not being used."
3,"Comfortable, but gets static interference","I bought these 4 years ago and used them frequently at my office while I worked. They are very comfortable and they have decent range to move around with. I also use them at home and have had terrible problems with static interference. I've lived in two different homes and had the same problem each place. It seems like you need to position your head just right to reduce the static noise, annoying! I've also had the same problem with getting them to charge; it's so touchy about how you set the headphones on the base. They work ok, but if you don't want the problem of static, then beware."
1,They are trashcan bound...,"These headphones are simply no good. First they arrived with stone-dead rechargable batteries. I had to pay to replace them. Now they work, but very intermittently and the sound quality is miserable - lots of static and frequent loud squeals and squawks. Don't waste your time and money. What has happened to JVC? They used to be a respectable company."
1,Will return it tomorrow,"I bought one from CircuitCity because I am suspicious that I might need to return it, although JVC is a brand I didn't have bad experience so far. This headphone is a real disappointment. Not only it has static noice, hard to charge, but 5 out of 10 times it cannot pick up the signal at all. I tried everything and it worked eventually, but I don't know which action causes this. Sometimes it did get the signal from the beginning, but after charging for a while, it cannot pick up the signal again. The instruction is not helpful either.Anyway, I am quite disappointed at the product. Will return it tomorrow."
5,Works as great as I hoped!,"Took a long time for the initial charging, but it works great. It has good sound, the volume is adjustable, and has held charge for a long time."
2,JVC Wireless Stereo headphones,What I don't like about these is the way you have to position them in the cradle to make sure they charge. I bought these for my elderly father and he's having a hard time positioning them correctly - and if they're not positioned correctly they won't charge.
2,Customer service,"The device is reasonably good when it works, but the problem was the power connection. It worked when I pluged it in but a few days later it quit and I found the power in line out and would not stay in. I tried the JVC web site for help but never got anywhere. I tried their phone no. and after punching several sets of selections I finally got to the one for my problem and as soon as I did I would be cut off. I found the warranty service center in my city and took it there. They found the problem but said they couldn't repair it as it was a replacement type instead. They gave me form to fill out and said sent it all back to JVC. The attendant said if it was his he would not undergo the hassel, take his loss and buy another one!"
1,Hiss and clicks and not a good sound.,"I am not sure why manufacturers make something that does not work well. Dont they realize that people wont purchase again?I thought a wireless headset would be a good idea, these headphones did not work well.1. The hiss and clicks on any channel makes them unusable.2. They are light and cheap feel3. They do not have much in terms of adjustment for strap.I returned these! I guess you have to spend $100 to get a decent pair or $300?"
3,Good Product,I bought these headphones for my mother to listen to TV after all else had gone to bed. The headphones work well except for one thing. To hear you must turn the TV volume higher when plugged to the audio out. Her TV does not have a headphone jack. I used them on my TV which has a headphone jack and the sound is crisp and clear. There is a couple of things I would have liked to have known before buying. The first is that it takes 30 hours to charge the battery. The second is that the headphones should not be continuesly charged. But let run down then recharge them.
1,i wouldn't use these if they were free,"Worst headphones i have ever used. There was a random crackle and hiss no matter what channel i used and no matter how many times i scanned. Then when there was no hiss the speakers sounded horrible once turned up a little. So even if the fm reception was clear they are still garbage, and yes i charged them for 30 hours (see instructions) before ending up with these results."
2,Not sure how long they'll last,"I had a pair of headphone from Radio Shack that finally gave out after 5 or 6 years. They were sturdy, had individual ear volume controls, good comfortably, well cushioned ear pieces. My daughter gave them to me as a gift when my hearing started declining. Unfortunately RC don't have them anymore and I searched the net for something comparable. They do the job, but are not as comfortable, sturdy, and all the things I listed. The charging base and transmitter are hard to set up to charge the batteries in the set. Unless you're desperate or cheap, don't buy this JVC set"
4,ENTERTAINING BUT WEIRD,"It seems as the Wingman series continues so do Mr. Maloney's weird additions of paranormal happenings. Overall, a very entertaining book to say the least with the Nazis and Asian Mercenary Cult joining forces and then helping the UAAF at the end to stop a comet from ending all of mankind. It seemed like an appropriate end to the series but it appears Maloney has taken our hero back in time in the next novel."
3,nacho pen,fun while it lasted. No way to replace battery if it dies...but it's a good laugh while it works.
5,Horse Whisperer DVD,Prompt service as usual. Love using Prime. Was a gift for my daughter-in-law and she loved it. Love Amazon service.
5,"Grace, Beauty, and Technique - A Winner!","I saw ""Horse Whisperer"" twice in the theater and once on video. Then I did the best thing possible - I read Monty Roberts ""The Man Who Listens to Horses."" Then I watched the ""Horse Whisperer"" a fourth time. It all made sense - the technique is real. I have a friend who used the ""gentler"" technique to gain the confidence of an adopted Mustang filly. It works! I was raised on a horse ranch where old-fashioned macho breaking techniques were used by my father like that of the common old west cowboy, and hated it. This summer I will be getting new horse for therapy riding, and will faithfully use the techniques learned by both the book and the movie. I highly recommend both the movie and the book. (I have not read the novel ""Horse Whisperer,"" and don't intend to - suggest if you really what to understand what is happening in the movie - read ""The Man Who Listens to Horses."")"
5,Great movie! The book was better,"The book was better than the movie, as the books usually are. However, I really enjoyed ""The Horse Whisperer."" It was a heartwarming story in terms of both the daughter and the horse eventually healing. The scenes in the movie were excellent matches for the descriptions in the book. This is a movie I must add to my collection!"
3,It's OK but not great,"This book seems like something Helen Fielding wrote in 2 weeks, the plot seems really implausible and at the same time cliche, it almost reads as an 8th grader's fiction class essay. I would have liked to read more in depth description of the main character and just overall more time spent on the scenes and situations. This is like the Salt movie written by an amateur. Even if I did not read the Bridget Jones' diaries (which I did and thoroughly enjoyed), I still would be perplexed how this kind of writing/book gets published. The al-Quaeda references are kind of annoying and boring and cliche, almost ridiculous. Please go back to the Bridget Jones type of books, those work well!!"
1,too absurd,"I thought this book would be funny, like Bridget Jones, but it wasn't. Since it's a spy novel, I hoped for some suspense, but this too was in short supply. Then there appeared to be some sort of romantic interest for the main character - too bad there wasn't any chemistry. What a yawn."
2,When the Brits do a story in the US,"Why is it that ordinarily brilliant and insightful British writers, when they do a story that takes place in the US, produce a superficial name-dropper with a plot like somebody's fantasy about the person they wish they were? This happened in Salman Rushdie's ""Fury"", where every character is out of a show case and the hero unbelievably successful - and now agaín the US is the setting for cliché fantasy with Fielding's ""Olivia Joules."" As writers they are excellent and readable, but this time around to enjoy them you must suffer stories that are unbearable self-satisfiers. Are they writing for comic strips? It would be the best medium for the scenarios and symbolic not-even-skin-deep characters."
5,GREAT! FAST! & FUNNY!,"This book was so much fun to read! I loved getting caught up in the book, I felt like I was there with Olivia. It's perfect if you want a light read but with adventure and wit!"
4,Does Anyone Know Why This Film Is Out Of Print?,"Does anyone know why ""The Daytrippers"" is out of print, and whether it will again become available on DVD?Intelligent film fans who haven't yet seen this movie are being cheated!"
4,"Nicely done book, with lots of photographs","The book is part history of the palestinians by photo, and part palestinian clothing. It is well illustrated, with many photos of palestinians over the past 120 years, and comments on what they are wearing.If I could ask for anything else, it would be more detail on which villages wore what clothing, and a greater focus and analysis of the embroidery."
4,Good resource,"I think this gives more of a summary than anything else. Students may find it useful for that, but the study topics and other info pales in comparison as to what is out there on the web regarding this topic"
