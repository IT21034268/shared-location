3,"Good, but explicit violence isn't necesarry in any film.","Well, this sequal is good, but I don't like the sort of violence, especially the scenes with the hypodermic neeldles."
2,Not as good as this Amazon rating suggests...,"I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly. Although Carpenter penned the screenplay, it was very much lacking from his suspenseful direction.This entry suffers from not enough Jamie Lee Curtis, a different guy playing Michael Meyers(in a different physical-style) and a mish-mashed storyline that barely plods along. All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around. I think Esacape from L.A. was a more worthy sequel, and that's not sayin' much..."
1,This movie is great. This edition isn't,"This edition states HiFi Sound and Surround Sound were used in the video production. Originally, yes, the film was recorded using the Dolby Stereo soundtrack, but in this Goodtimes home video there isn't even HiFi sound. The track used is mono and the sound is horrible. Goodtimes is not a quality company and I have not seen one video release of theirs that contains anything, but horrible video quality and horrible sound quality."
4,THE DIRECT SEQUEL - still HALLOWEEN!,"This is an atmospheric and scary sequel - really worth to watch and own if you like the first part!Pros:- atmosphere is similar spooky as in the fist part- quiet funky new Theme and Soundtrack- a suprisingly good and direct sequelCons:- average DVD picture quality- no Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack (just Dolby Stereo Surround)- no commentary track- no extras at all (except for some production notes)General:- a new version from Universal Studios is now available, however I don't own it and I have no idea what extras may be on it or how good the quality is"
3,Okay Movie,"I didn't think that this was one of the better Halloween movies. It mostly took place in the hospital, and there wasn't much gore or murders. I think that the Halloween movies following this one were much more interesting."
3,OK SEQUEL,"IN THIS 1981 SEQUEL, MICHAEL MYERS RETURNS TO FINISH OFF WHAT HE COULDN'T FINISH IN THE 1ST FILM, WHICH IS KILL HIS SISTER. THIS MOVIE IS NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS ITS PREDECESSOR, BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN A LOTTA HORROR SEQUELS. JAMIE LEE CURTIS' ROLE IS WASTED IN THIS FILM. SHE SHOULD'VE BEEN MUCH MORE ACTIVE THAN WHAT SHE WAS. ANYWAY, THIS SEQUEL MANAGES TO BE ALRIGHT. THIS MIGHT NOT BE AS MEMORABLE AS HALLOWEEN 1, BUT IT'S FUN FOR HORROR FANS AND MOVIE FANS IN GENERAL."
5,More Of The Night He Came Home.,"Halloween 2 is the classic sequel to John Carpenter's Halloween & I think this film is even better than the original.Rick Rosenthal, who is also the director of HALL8WEEN: RESURRECTION does a great job directing this film.With the return of Jamie Lee Curtis,Charles Cyphers & Donald Pleasance, the film is a continuation of the first film.Now, with Laurie in the hospitol, Michael comes to find her but is distracted by all these other people in the hospitol who will try to protect Laurie if any harm comes her way.Can Laurie escape Michael's rath once again or will her luck run out?I recommend this one to any fan of the original Halloween."
3,It was OK,"Though this film seems a rather impressive film at first, at second glance you can see how it has destroid the first film. This film goes strictly for gore, nothing else, Halloween was suspense. With a few good moment popping up now and then this film really doesn't have anything new to offer."
3,Good Follow Up,"Halloween 2 picks right up where the original left off.After Loomis(Donald Pleasense) shot Michael, he looked down to see Michael was gone.Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) who survived the attack from Michael is now off to the hospital.Michael Myers now played by Dick Warlock follows Laurie to the hospital while Loomis tries to find Michael.Why Michael Myers is after Laurie is revealed.The Script was once again wrote by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.Rick Rosenthal is now Director and did a fairly good job.But Carpenter did come back to do some reshoots.Halloween 2 gets off to a fast start then slows down before picking up again.It's best to watch Hallowen 2 right after the original, if you wait too long you might find yourself getting a bit bored at times.Watching them back to back though is the best way too go very creepy that way."
3,The Boogeyman Returns!,The sequel to the high anticipated Halloween. I have to admit this was a pretty good sequel on accounting most sequels are bad. This movie was flawed but it was enjoyable to watch. The story for H2 was simple Michael is still alive and he travels to a hospital Laurie Strode is staying well that cant be good can it? This one continues of from the first one when Michael falls off a balcony from six shots by Dr. Loomis. I enjoyed this film a plethora amount. I think this one like Halloween was scary and thrilling. This is what you actually call a Thrill Ride. This one is worth buying not unlike Halloween Ressurection. This one is close to the best of them all.
3,Don't buy the wrong one,"For those buying the 30th Anniversary blu ray, you are buying the wrong one! The blu ray that was just released is from Shout! Factory that is called COLLECTOR'S EDITION! I see the 30th anniversary on the best sellers, I think people are buying it cause it is cheaper, but it is the wrong one! Buy the Collector's edition!"
1,Worst sequel ever,I don't see how people love or even like this sequel. The only part of the movie I actually liked was the beginning. It was great how it actually started right where the first one left off but that was it. After that it just went to hell. The ending of this movie was completely ridiculous and I will never watch this movie again. If you want to see a good horror sequel watch Friday the 13th part 2.
5,Really great movie,"Classic movie,thanks a lot,I had a great time watching it,the best of the Halloween series,thanks again,I'll be buying some more."
3,Worth a look.,What's interesting about this sequel is that it picks up directly where the first ended. It's a seamless transition and a worthy addition to the Halloween series.Recommended.
4,Still Very Scary,"Halloween 2 goes into the genre of ""Luke, I'm your father"". It went from pure suspense to sheer gore and gross-out, in another way to manipulate the audience. Myers is much more demonic. The movie is still very scary and holds up today. It's Rick's idea to make the clogs fall off and no one would strip except Pamela Susan Schoop(She said herself!). When Dick Warlock showed up to meet Rick, he put the mask on and just stared at him."
2,Blu ray picture a let down !,If Universal would of got their act together and removed the specks and dust pops then this picture would of been great! This is nothing more then laziness on their part. I will say that this is still worth getting for the 'Terror in the Aisles' documentary never before released on dvd. It's pretty sad that the Halloween 2 dvd never had these dust scratches but the blu ray does! How is blu ray suppose to stay on top with all the mediocre releases they have put out. If I just bought blu ray and saw this picture next to the blu ray of Christmas Vacation I would of said I was ripped off to no end! Both these pictures are examples of releases to worth buying as picture quality especially in High Def! Disappointing Universal... without Terror in the Aisles I would want my money back!
3,OK sequel,Still a very good plotline follows our survivor from the original movie to the hospital in this sequel. Micheal Meyers is fast on her trail as she tries to get free of his rein of terror.A good plot twist showing that she is actually a Micheal Meyer's younger sister. But besides that the terror and character empathy is not there.
4,"Not as good as the original, but very creepy and disturbing.","While much maligned for it's excessive gore and high body count, ""Halloween II"" still freaks me and everyone I watch it with out because of it's setting, a hospital Jamie Lee Curtis is taken to following her encounter with Michael Myers in the first film, and some of the most unique movie murders ever. From dark maintenence closets to gloomy hospital hallways, therapy chambers, and surgery rooms, Michael proceeds to kill everyone who gets in his way as he closes in on Curtis, using imaginative tools such as syringe needles, boiling hydrotherapy tubs, I.V. tubes, and of course, a scalpel. This is also the movie that reveals Laurie's (Curtis) link to the killer, and introduces the use of the ""Mr. Sandman"" theme featured in last years hit sequel ""H20"". You'll never feel the same in a hospital at night again, and I feel this movie belongs in any horror fan's collection."
2,good not great,this was an okay follow up. the main promblem is the shape is not creepy enogh. john carpter has said that they only used a stunt man to play him in this instad of a real actor like in part one. overall it has some good parts.
1,In one word: terrible!,"To anyone considering buying this DVD, please do yourself a favor and don't get it! This so-called sequel stinks and it can't hold a candle to the original (of which I'm a great fan and could ""sing its praises"" until doomsday). Put simply, it should never have been made and John Carpenter's heart was never really into making a sequel to his inspired 1978 film. Just read film critic Roger Ebert's reviews of Halloween and Halloween 2 for a proper assessment of these two movies. As he says, ""It's a little sad to witness a fall from greatness, and that is what we get with Halloween 2."" Probably the only thing worthwhile about the DVD is the audio commentaries."
4,Why isnt this movie in dvd?? still in vhs?,"I always wonder why this beatiful movie still in vhs and not in dvd. Most of the movies from that time are already in dvd. Is there a way if I buy it in vhs, to burn it in dvd? and what about the cuality of the movie?"
3,Solid book from a First Time Author,"Olson's debut novel presents an intriguing enough story line to keep the reader interested throughout the entire book. I give Olson a lot of credit, as this was not as raw and unpolished as I was expecting.The main complaints I would have about this book are that it really lacks the true suspense, as well as the twist and turns you see from most thrillers. The story simply unfolds, and comes across as rather flat at times. This novel wasn't exactly a chore to get through, but it wasn't a book I could't wait to finish to see the ultimate outcome of the story.Olson's character development could have been better as well, but this was a solid enough debut."
3,I have read better...,"Keeping pace with the new religious thriller type genre, aka Da Vinci Code MANIA, The Icon is sub par. Honestly I had a hard time keeping the characters in order because I did not feel that they were developed enough. I did enjoy how the story was told through ""flash backs"". This aspect made things more interesting and exciting. I felt, though, that the author put SO much stress onto how the Icon was special and held these mystical powers, but by the end I felt kind of let down by what the Icon actually was and what it represented. I guess that was kind of the point of the novel, but I just didn't buy it. The read was enjoyable enough, but maybe don't put it at the top of your list?"
5,Surprisingly easy to install,"I'm always afraid of cutting holes in my canvas, roof, skull, etc... These were surprisingly easy to install with a razor blade, I put in 2 in 10-15 mins. The poles fit into holes in the bottom of the vents pretty much the same as they did in the grommets I replaced with vents."
3,DK Eyewitness Travel Guide,The book is quite interesting and contains adequate information for big cities. However there is not enough information regarding travelling by train to smaller country towns.
4,"OOOh, Mmmmm","These are definately ""in the mood"" sounds. I'd like the order to be a bit better sequenced and a couple of selections are mood killers, but overall it's a keeper."
5,Good product; great service,I am a breastffeding mom who was recommended this product by my lactation consultant. Product really did increase my milk supply within two days. Motherlove service was professional and fast. I heartily recommend both the product and the company.
4,A Warrior's Heart!,This movie was long...and okay...nothing spectacular. It was slow moving...the acting was fine...the storyline was kind of boring at times...but despite this...still an ok movie to watch.
2,shameless,"i have not viewed these discs yet. i'm sure there's nothing to complain about as far as the show itself. i've been waiting for these axiously for a long time.but c'mon. the packaging is cheap. the price for volume 1 is overpriced for the ENTIRE series!7 episodes on 12 discs? umm so what, theres FIVE ""bonus"" discs? regardless of the episodes being at 90 minutes or whatever, there are many hour long shows on today that fit several episodes on a disc. dvds can hold well over 3+ hours of high quality video and audio.this is blatant and shameless greed, and somewhat of a monopoly. how else can we see these in crystal clear format. no other way but to pay $10+per episode.or netflix. still it's 12 discs to see 7 episodes."
1,boooo,I am so ticked off. I have been waiting forever for these dvds to come out and when they do not only are they way over priced but they are changed. I say release the way they where shown on TV and have these redone ones as well. That is what they did for star wars you can get both on DVD. I am hoping they do the same for these. If they don't then I guess I just will not have them at all. For I would rather not watch the show and remember the way it was with good memories then watch this rehacked job and have a bad tase in my mouth for the show. Sigh and I was so looking forward to their release. I mean who really cares if some of the details from the show are different from the movies. If they do well then they can buy this redone one. I for one don't care. I loved the show as it was and the same with the movies. Sigh I was so looking foward to seeing the show that I loved as a kid again. I guess I have to wait until they reshow it on RTE again.
5,it was a gift,I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend's little brother (he asked us to get it). The price was right on amazon and the episodes were pretty good.
3,Good book afterall,The book was very clear from the beginning but mention so little on the Web Development using SAP. Good book for SQL developer but not for developing WEB using ASP. This book emphasizes the essential of SQL Server side and do mention too little about ASP. If anyone want to develop ASP with SQL server this is not the right book for them.
3,"I reviewed before, but I have to lower my rating","I've been learning more stuff and I got more books and the new things altered my rating standards.The Access integration and the database integration programming is all too obsolete. Access2000 supports OLE-DB connections to SQL server with .adp files. This book teaches the old Access97 method in using ODBC link tables. Also, outside the function/constant reference, the Microsoft Implementation Trainging Kit (Like a lot, but at $80, needs to be better), and the DBA Survival Guide makes the DBA portion of this book worthless. Inside SQL Server rocks and with the DBA survival guide equates to the best $80 investment for SQL Server Admin/Development.I wasn't really interested in the database integration part of the book. I only bother with ADO and ASP books cover that very well."
4,My first Tarot book. Good for beginners.,"I first got this book in 1979. While I agree with one other reviewer that the beginning of the book with the meditation practices are a bit farfetched, the analyzation of the cards and the spreads are good. Her next book For the Journeyman is all very good. I, however, have to discount all the religious hangups that she has, but her interpretations are OK if a bit brief."
5,MSB Hops Home,"My daughter started watching MSB when she was 3-4 years old, and it held her interest until she was 10. The episodes are fun and engaging while being educational at the same time, so children learn without even knowing it! Don't let the school age children in the series deter parents of younger children... Pre-K and Kindergarteners will delight in the show too.Synopsis of this episode (from the back cover):Topic: HabitatsWanda goes over the top when she turns the entire classroom into a comfortable new home for her beloved pet frog, Bella. It's everything a frog could want.. or so Wanda thinks. However, when Bella jumps out an open window, Wanda learns to rethink her idea of what a frog needs."
4,Blondie's UK singles,Nice package ! Great sound quality ! I love the extended version of War Child and the spanish version of Call Me. For the rest I own everything from Blondie already on their remastered original albums and their Greatest Hits albums. What I really do miss here are the US singles : The Hardest Part and One Way Or Another and their dutch hitsingle: I'm Gonna Love You Too !! Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars!!! Because of the great original single package and the magnificent sound quality... If you're a Blondie fan : BUY IT
1,Not satisfied with this camera,"I purchased this camera in April 2002, and I loved the initial rolls of film developed. I have twins and needed an automatic camera so I would not miss important shots. In the first few months, the pictures were sharp with vivid colors and I was extremely satisfied with the camera. In July, the pictures started to develop a gray hue and it was barely noticeable until September when it was evident there was a problem. Looking back at my photo album, I now see the gradual grayness in the photos. I sent it in for repair, as Canon honored the warranty. It took a couple of weeks turn around time. However, the very first roll after repair developed with very dark shadows and the flash was operating! Unfortunately, the camera has been sent again for repairs. I hope Canon will send me a new one because I do believe I bought a lemon."
1,Read the manual first,This is NOT a user friendly machine.It's the most frustrating TV recording device I have ever owed.
2,The jury is still out,"The digital tuner works great and it plays DVDs well. However, in the two attempts to burn a DVD from the hard drive, it has not been successful. The first time, while I was editing my content(removing commercials, deleting scenes, ect.) the device locked up and corrupted my entire project, didn't even get a chance to burn it to DVD. The second time, I did very little editing for fear of losing my project and burned to DVD. When I played the finished DVD, the last 10 minutes of it was corrupted. I originally purchased this product so I can burn old VHS family movies onto DVD, but if I continue to have issues, I'll just use this for a glorified Tivo/digital tuner and go back to using my PC for DVD burning. Disappointed!"
4,Philips DVD/Digital receiver,"This unit has a great digital receiver. I've been recording some programs in HD since I am now getting digital channels through my roof antenna.The unit is a bit noisy however and the remote buttons are small with hard to read labels. The instruction book is jam packed with instructions and after a couple of months I'm starting to feel comfortable with ""some"" of the features available. I have yet to explore all of the features/options. On the other hand recording to the hard drive is awesome!"
4,Great Product,Received it in a timely manner and so far has been working fine! The hard drive is the only way to go!!!
4,Best for the Price,Pros:Ease of use. Good picture and audio. Remembers where you left off after watching recorded program. 1081 upconversion ATSC TunerCons:Cannot title until after recording. No true Chase and Play. Limited editing functions.
3,a DVR without pay any monthly fees,A good product to record live video programs. Easy to burn video into a disk for personal collection. Built-in Analog turner is good only till Feb 2009. It would have been a good idea to include a built-in Digital turner with this product.
1,An absolutely stupid waste of time!,"Don't waste your money on this ""family"" trifle. The storyline is very stupid and SO familiar: a girl loses her dog, the dog finds his way back, and runs into various encounters along the way. Its boring, stupid, and has nothing enjoyable. If you want a ""dog loses master"" film, then get the EXCELLENT Lassie movies made by MGM in the 1940s in breathtaking Technicolor.Finally, the quality of the image is extremely poor. Its in EP, not SP mode, as if someone recorded this off of a local television station! The color is blurred and has very poor contrast, the image is so hazy its almost fog-like, and the audio quality is very poor even with the volume turned up to the loudest. Don't waste your time on this trifle. It was made on a very low budget and every second looks like it. It's so obscure that Leonard Maltin doesn't list this, and for good reason!"
4,A Great Wee Tome to Pick up the Lein,"I love Allan Morrison's wee little books with Scottish colloquialisms. This one is quite a little gem, especially if you're trying SASL. (Scots As a Second Language ;-)It's neat, compact, cute, hilarious, easily fits in your pocket and comes complete with a glossary (something curiously lacking in some other Scottish tomes). I'd also like to add that learning even a handful of these little sayings to memory will endear you to any Scot. A couple of favorites:""De ye think I'm up the Clyde on a bike?""(Do you think I'm an idiot?)""Sodgers wi' big guns beat sodgers wi' pretty dresses.""(Being practical is more important than being presentable)""Som would flay a louse fer it's skin.""(Some people are so mean that they'd skin a flea for it's skin).A true delight, well worth the money and easy to understand. A charming volume for anyone studying Scots."
5,excellent book all around!,"This is such a good book! I've been looking for other titles by Sidney Filson ever since I read it. Martial arts, love, different cultures, adventure, action- it's all there! Not for the squeamish; the sex and death scenes are rather graphic, but written so well!"
1,BVM is not a Goddess,"The Catholic Church never has nor does she now regard the Blessed Virgin Mary to be a godess, or a divine person, in any way. She is the masterpiece creature, the perfect creature, but she is still a creature. Catholics and others who insist on worshipping Mary rather than honoring her to the glory of her Son are sincere, but sincerely mistaken. Holy Mary, pray for them."
3,kind of out there... a girls opinion,"I watched this movie when I was younger and I liked it then. obviously, adults won't like it, but it's a kids movie... . I watched it a lot, but when I think about it, I'd say rent it, don't buy it."
2,Not very Good,I was at my friends house when I saw this movie. The plot isn't great. It stinks! Anastasia's family got turned into a bunch of instuments! The animation is like comics in the newspapers. It's my opinion so wacth the movie and rate this movie for yourself. The bad guys are just guys with guns who don't like her just to say.
4,Not Bad At All,"I only deducted one star because the singer sounds a bit whiney at times. Other than that, it is a pretty good album with a vibe all its own. Mentionable is one of its songs, No More Love. It was in the movie Johnny Mnemonic (with Keanu Reeves). Enjoy."
1,What is this?!!,"You know how when you get a CD and first listen to it, its not too appealing? And how after a few good listens, it isn't soooo bad after all? Well, this one missed the spot. Wish I could give it 0 stars but there's no such thing in the rating system. Very unoriginal, boring, and the lyrics are terrible. I even sold it to a used CD store for very cheap. Stay away from these guys."
5,Great read!,This is a very entertaining and easy to read book. The book keeps you wanting more and I am hoping Ms. Mitchell will write a sequel.
4,"BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING MELODIES FROM A MASTER SONGSMITH","This CD should come with a warning: YOU MAY BECOME ADDICTED TO THESE MELODIES! I can listen to this stuff before sleep (its a great CD to doze off to) and then wake up in the morning and the haunting melodies are still abuzz in my head. Although the lyrics are flaky at times, the beautifully crafted melodies and wonderful, relaxed feel of the music make this a worthwhile purchase for everyone who enjoys good, clear tuneful music. And to think this guy has been a grandfather for some time now! Anyway, Donovan is one of those rare musicians whose voice and style have not changed with the years..."
3,The Minstrel in Black,"After Rick Rubin's success with Johnny Cash, this should have been a match made in Heaven.A mostly acoustic album, similar to ""A Gift from a Flower.."" or Donovan's pre-Most recordings.I think what I fine a little disappointing with the album is that Rubin is the absolute master of producing rock groups, giving their sound a rich & imaginative texture; but Because of his success in creating Johnny Cash's stripped down ""American Recordings"", I think he anticipated the same trick would work again with ""Sultras"". Unfortunately the album ends up sounding a little flat, especially the last quarter, where Donovan seem to have run out of ideas.This is by no means a bad record, probably Donovan's strongest since his 1974 ""Essence to Essence"", it's just a shame that Donovan relationship with Rubin ended before some really special music was created."
4,"Wait, don't buy this MAc","I am really disappointed that when I bought this computer (Nov 21st, 2007) there was NO warning in the web page that it did not came with Leopard already installed. I just spent another $10.65 (nothing, really !!) for a product I was supposed to get already installed. Now I have to wait Standard shipping from the Apple Store and sit back and try to enjoy my Macbook with Tiger !!! UNBELIEVABLE !!! AND TRULY DISAPOINTED"
2,Very Dissapointing,Mix A Lot was one of my favorite artists back in the day. Posse on Broadway was an incredible song with other classics on his first album. The sound was revolutionary. This album is just terrible. I think most of the reviews on this site look fake because there is no one in their right mind who would rate this over 3 stars. The mastering and mixing is top quality but the beats and rap on this is just horrible. I was expecting so much more from Mix A Lot like Rippin or Posse on Broadway and those type of tracks. This is too bad because he is a talented guy.
4,Really great for home use,"My husband and I purchased this unit and tools for an engineered flooring installation for our entire house. We have never used a compressor or nailers before and found it very easy not intimidating to use. We purchased seperately a pneumatic floor nailer to use with the compressor, but we installed the quarter round and started the flooring project with the included nailers. Easy to load, use and has good safety features. If you need this for at home projects its a great tool and small enough to store away and take from room to room as you work.The only problem you will have is organizing all the projects that you can now turn out with these nailers!! Just like the home makeover shows!"
4,Bostitch CPACK3 Kit,"After using the compressor heavily, and all the tools moderately for more than 3 months - I'm very happy with the package. The accessory kit for $20 was well worth it - and get a filter.The only complaint I have is the NOISE level - this thing is LOUD - if you use it indoors, Hearing Protection is A MUST Have."
3,"""War is so Twentieth Century""","Gore Vidal is vital.Vital to the dissemination of truth in our endangered (from within) country.Vidal does an excellent job in portraying our times.One of my favorites: ""The Cheney-Bush junta is convinced that Americans are so simple minded that they can deal with no scenario more complex than the venerable lone, crazed killer (this time with zombie helpers) who does evil just for the fun of it 'cause he hates us, 'cause we're rich 'n' free 'n' he' not"". (page 16).The 196 pages are a quick read.I highly recommend getting this book."
5,Wake Up.,This is a must read book for all Americans with an attention span longer than their shoesize.Gore Vidal as given us a refreshingly honest and incisive volume critical of America's foreignpolicy and the jaundiced views of those in the State Department who have the idea that permanentconflict is somehow compatible with enduring peace.Gore Vidal has given America a chance to wake-up now before the sun sets.
3,cute,"I have tried this sandal but have not worn it out as yet. I like the looks of it,I did go 1/2 size larger because of the thong so all seems to be well for now."
3,cute but painful,I purchased these in gold and they're very nice sandals but the strap between the toes hurt a lot. I've worn them several times and it hasn't gotten any better.
2,Not Their Best,"This is a pretty good CD. Not all of the songs are live, like it says. They mislabeled one of the songs. The music video is awesome and fun to watch. Id on't think I'd reccomend this to anyone, if you're a hard core Styx fan, they just don't sound the same anymore."
3,WWII overload!,"Molly is my favorite character in the American Girls Series, however I was a bit disappointed in the non-fiction addition to the series. Welcome to Molly's World has a wonderful layout, and I did learn a bit from people living in the 1940's, however the book is very heavy on WWII...maybe a little too much. Although the 1940's were influenced by WWII, that is not all that is indictative of the decade. Therefore, I give this book about 3 stars, because I think the book had WWII overload and not much else."
3,"Just ""okay"" book","In the entire book, there were about 7 pages that had ideas I would use. Most of the suggestions are uber easy things we already do each day."
2,Wrong Picture,"Wow... Targus must have changed the product but kept the TAP100 product name. What I recieved was a 10.75x4x4.25"" 'shaving case' sized thing. Not at all what I was looking for or what is described. Ck out the Targus website for an accurate description and photo...."
4,Nice Case,"I bought this thinking it just MIGHT fit my 15.4"" laptop. It doesn't; now I have to take it back. But it is a nice case- sleek with memory foam. Would fit nicely into a larger backpack, which was my original intention."
3,"Weird, but in a good way...( 3 1/2 stars)","Hmm...where to begin? This was an odd story. The heroine Paloma was very sweet, but isolated...it was the hero who was the most intriguing...I cant get into the reasons why, I dont want to enter spoiler territory. I dont think that this book is for everyone. It requires the reader to be very openminded, and to disregard the notion that this tale could in any way occur in reality. I personally enjoyed it and would have given it a higher rating, but I felt that the writing style was a bit amateurish and I wanted a better facial description of the hero.Would I recommend this?..Im not sure, but I am glad that I had a chance to experience it myself."
1,BAD TASTE,my child was on this for about two weeks.during this time I didn't notice any changeand was also told that the taste was awful.I tried to dissolve it in orange juice and wasn'table to.Neu-BeCALM'd Chewables - 90 Tablets
3,"Nice form factor, but lower image quality than expected","This is a great little camera for quick shots but actually had less resolution even on the highest setting than my dinosaur of a 1.3 mp Olympus. Also, movie mode audio track has a lot of digital noise. If you're after a fun all-rounder, however, this is a great camera with a fantastic user interface and design"
5,smooth and real...,"What a great disc! Beautifully composed and executed...solid memorable trax...not at al ""gimmicky."" Holds up over many listens.No wonder John Digweed selected them for his famous ""Renaissance II"" compilation.Class act...Favorite trax: ""My Shee Koya Knee"" ""The Dream"""
4,An unexpected treat,"This was a great find. The Doctor's Wife is the author's take on Flaubert's Madame Bovary, in a rural English setting. For a book written in the 1860's, the writing is fresh and modern, and I loved the writer's occasional very biting, yet witty commentaries on contemporary society and manners. It's far more vivid and grounded than Bronte, more approachable than Austen, and avoids the prosiness and piety of a lot of the fiction of the period. She approaches a plot which, let's face it, must have been pretty racy for the time with a directness and lack of moralising that I loved. She shows great sympathy for her silly, flawed heroine, and didn't feel the need to punish her as most of her contemporaries would have. Mary Anne Braddon must have been quite a woman and I am looking foward to reading more of her work. It's a decent edition too. Thanks!"
1,lame,Hated it- I couldn't even get past the first chapter. There is nothing catching about this book. I would definitely Not recommend this book
1,Better than Ambien,"Full Moon productions churned out some fairly decent horror in it's day...but what happened?What's wrong with this stinker? Just about everything. The plot just drags along. This is a slow, slow, dull movie. It's ultra low budget. There are errors galore. For example, in the opening an old man and a young woman enter the building for an inspection. They start up a staircase together, but in the next scene, he is the only one to make it to the top. He has enough time to start the inspection through several rooms before he is killed. At that point, the woman arrives at the top of the staircase. What took her so long?This movie is just bad, and not in a Ed Wood kind of way."
2,Mitchum & Russell in flawed but fun film,"Being that Robert Mitchum is my favorite actor it is difficult for me to say anything negative about the films he appears in. This isn't a bad film, just a little murky. Mitchum is confident and cocky as ever; Russell is sexy as a nightclub singer on the lamb. Atmosphere is good, characters are o.k. , but I get the feeling this film is trying to be steal some of the elements of ""Gilda"" and it falls way short."
2,"NG - 3 strikes, no more buy","I had a pair of Bluettes at my old residence for dishwashing, they lasted for a long time and were made in the USA so I thought I'd try them again, bad choice.1) They aren't made in the USA anymore but are still quite expensive2) They do last a long time compared with the thinner gloves from the supermarket3) They are blue in color but then the ""hand"" portion of the glove, from about the wrist to the tip of the fingers is covered with a darker blue coating. Unfortunately, this dark blue coating rubs off on the dishes, so unless you eat off of blue china exclusively, don't wash dishes with these gloves.4) Even with the coating, the gloves don't grab onto the dishes, I've dropped/chipped a couple of dishes whiles washing them. So as a result, I hold onto the dishes tightly, that's probably why the blue coating comes off the left hand more than the right since I wash with the right, hold with the left.Why couldn't they leave them the way they were ?"
4,A Captivating Read,"This was a great book to be stuck on a train with! I'd just finished a rather amateurish novel; it was such a relief to read something by an author who knows how to construct a solid plot, interesting characters, strong conflict, and then flesh it out with a wonderful command of the language.Was the orgy too long? Yes. Other than that the book held me in suspense by the twisted path to retrieve the treasure, and the fact that we went so long without a ""hard"" love scene was a surprise. Imho the heroine (and almost everyone else) should have been more shocked by the statue (and etc.), but otherwise the period seemed correct. What we were left with were two fascinating, dynamic characters caught in a skewed and tangled web where they could be discovered at any moment.Excellent escapist fare."
3,Good reference,"David Gero has covered many of the 1000's of Air Incdents in this book.I would have liked to have seen more photos or Drawings relating to individual incidents.The more recents incidents where much information is available today, I thought, were somewhat vague, felt they could have been elaborated on.However an excellent reference text. Recommend for an collection."
3,"Unbelievable technique, unorthodox phrasing","As my title states, Angel Romero's technique is very clean and precise. His dynamic range is huge. This set of pieces in itself is a documentation of his versatility as an artist; combining pieces of pure burn (Allard) with simple (Tarrega miniatures) and artful soundscapes (Torroba, Albeniz). However, the phrasing is often very akward. I don't understand why someone with so much musical background and technique, coming from a family that practically educated the instrument on musicality, would phrase music so irrationally. For instance, listen to Angel's Estudio Brillante. The phrasing sounds like the fingering. Any master violinist or pianist playing this piece would not phrase the scale and arpeggio phrases in the way Romero does on this recording. Otherwise, the album is basically a greatist hits CD with some formidably played but non-essential renditions of the pieces all classical guitar masters play."
4,mellow music,"This cd has a lovely classic guitar sound. I only gave it 4 stars because I expected a more lively cd (you know the kind of fast fingering classical guitar?). Don't get me wrong - the music is REALLY nice, it's just a much slower and mellower fingering than I was anticipating."
4,Steam Locomotives,"The most comprehensive outline of steam locomotive engineering that I have seen. Mainly concentrates on British practices, not too much on US practice."
5,!!!!!OMG!!!!,OMG!!! this was the best heartland book so far!!!! its more then great im not finished reading it but OMG!!! its makin me CRY!!! so *u'll c wen u read it* but man this book is soooo sooooo GREAT!!! its dedfinatly more then 5 stars hands down well let me get bac to finishing it* ok DONE OMG!!! i gotta get muh hands on the next book!! at the end it'll leave u cravin 4 the next bok garunteeit!!! well im not gonna give any hints to wat happeneds but to ani1 how loves horses out there u will love i MEEN LOVE this book!!!!! beyond EXCELLENT WORK!!! Lauren Brooke!!! thanks 4 a book i couldnt put down even 4 a miniute!!! BEYOND EXELLENT WORK!!! LAUREN BROOK!!! :):):):
3,One Of The Saddest So Far!,... I love the Heartland books! I've never read any horse novels before and actually fell in love with them! I think Lauren Brooke is a great author. I own all 13 Heartland books. I'm hoping to get the 14th one for Christmas. I also want the 15th one when it comes out. Out of all of them though the 13th one has to be the most sad. It was pretty hard for me to keep reading it. I really wanted to find out what would happen with Ty though. I think the relationship between him and Amy is so wonderful. Oh and as a teen I also enjoy the kissing parts too! I can't wait to read #14 and #15!!!!
4,The best book ever!,I really loved this book its very interesting. If you dont like horses well thats ok because it makes you feel like you do This book really tells whats going on you really get in to it.This book was about a girl and some horses and the horses are driving her crazy because they are all getting sick . If you would like to now more pick one up there GREAT!
4,Boston Punk Rock,"gibby, who later went on the panic, sang for this great boston punk rock/hardcore band. i would consider them punk rock, but what are you gonna do? if you are fan of fast, old school punk rock similar to the dropkick murphy's on ""do or die,"" (minus the irish ....), definitely check out ""nobody laughs anymore"" by the trouble. probably the most popular song on this album would be ""dead and gone,"" which boston hardcore band American Nightmare covered on their ""the sun isn't getting any brighter"" 7"". check out the trouble, it makes me wish all punk was this good."
1,Misrepresentation,"I have just seen tape no. 1 (Mine is a 2 tape set.) Tape 1 is called ""The Early Years."" It is just a bit of very superficial comment about his early life, and then most of the 46 minute video is just one old TV program, with Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, and Louis Armstrong. One old TV show, showing musical numbers by Crosby, Lee and Armstrong, and a few with Sinatra, is not exactly ""his life and times - the early years."" Save your money. (The second tape is ""The Radio Years."" Hopefully, that will be better, but I'm not optimistic.)"
2,Doesn't fit,"I contacted Reverware before I purchased this item to find out if it was compatible with and if it would fit the Revereware 12"" copper clad fry pan I already have. I was told that this lid would fit any Reverware 12"" frypan. After receiving the lid from Amazon I was unhappy to find that the lid doesn't fit the pan. Size wise the lid fits, but it doesn't set down on the frypan because of the way the pan is tapered where the lid fits on."
5,works perfectly,"This strap is perfect for me. I put it on my left calf below the knee, so that it is facing traffic and it moves up and down with my leg, so the motion attracts more attention than, say, putting it on my arm.I haven't been able to observe it as a motorist, but it both reflects headlights and glows bright red (or blinks). The adjustable elastic strap holds in nicely in place.I use it in conjunction with Nite Ize spoke lights, a Planet Bike Blinky on my helmet, a blinking tail light under my seat, and a 1000-lumen Magic Shine bike light for maximum visibility."
1,"Too expensive and Flimsy, not all that safe for young children.",Too expensive for what's offered. Anyone could easily make this. It's not all that safe for children because it's flimsy.
1,ipod skin,Well the description was kindof confusing about what ipod it would fit. it said it would fit the ipod I have but when i got it for my daughters ipod it was way to big!!
3,"More artifacts, less of the host!","Factually accurate as far as it goes, this rather monotonous documentary misses its potential. Well produced, it falls short on specifics, coherence, and artifacts. The camera is always on the host, Bettany Hughes, making her the focus of the documentary rather than the fascinating archaeological finds of Crete.I've been reading several works on the Aegean Bronze Age, and perhaps this has lead to my disappointment. If I was a complete newcomer to the field, I might have found this more fascinating."
5,the nomination,This book was a page turner ! What a look at the hidden agendas inside political life. Kept me going right through with all the twists...An author to watch. A very good read..
2,Too much info too fast,"I ordered this book because it got so many good reviews, but I was disappointed. There are about ten- twenty different pieces of information on each page. It's overwhelming. I was going to use it to teach a new student but it would have been so confusing. There are several new concepts taught on a page without any means for the child to practise them and actually ""do"" them. It's as if the child is expected to memorize them without any experience with the information.I went to my local music store and looked through all the beginning piano books and decided upon ""Alfred's Basic Piano Library- Lesson Book, Level 1A."" It's great- it introduces one new concept per page and has the child practise it in easy steps, little by little inching forward. The illustrations are also a lot nicer. Also, the print is way bigger. It looks spacious. The Usborne book has all this information crammed into a page in tiny little bubbles of print, sort of like a comic strip."
1,Item received was not what I ordered.,"The doll I ordered was not what I received. And, I returned the doll over a month ago, and as of yet have not received a refund. What a disappointment since I usually have good service with Amazon.com."
1,NOT HAPPY WITH THIS UGLY DOLL>>>>,"IF YOU WANT A BEAUTIFUL ASIAN DOLL, I JUST FOUND A COUPLE IN EBAY UNDER "" ASIAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL "". THE ONE I GOT ON EBAY WAS GORGEROUS!!! MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND WON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT."
4,Memorable concert!,"Since of the best versions of the Sonata No. 2 in all the story of the great music is from Casadesus (the 1947 version) I bought this CD with great expectations (My favorite one live performance of Benedetti Michelangeli from Praga 1957). In this case the result was not so convincing as I expected.The Sonata no. 3 was more interesting . The multiple expressive richness contained in this work allowed to Casadesus to make use of his powerful skills and get a superb interpretation .The Ballades No. 2, 3 y 4 were the most remarkable. The Ballade no. 1 is signed for two names : Frau Carreño and William Kapell.This is a live recording from Paris 1962."
5,Aloha Means Goodbye,"This book takes place in a hospital in California. A young single woman has become ill. She stays in the hospital for a long period of time to find out nothing is wrong. Her hobby is signing up for free trips,winning anything she can. She wins a free trip to Hawaii to find her self chaporoned by a nasty woman. The woman takes her to a home after telling her the hotel was booked up. She finds out she is the heart donar for a young man who was in the hospital at the same time she was. I won't tell the ending, so not to spoil how it ends. Way cool ending. This book was so good. I could not put it down. It was a mystery, romance, historic, everything you want to read in a book. No bad language. I would read it again."
2,"Touches on the basics, but very inept overall.","As AP Environmental Science is not offered at my school, I decided to take it as an independent study course, as did two of my friends. Both of them ordered the Princeton book, and I bought this one. It was a choice I came to regret.Although this book touches on some topics, it does so in little detail and is a poor supplement to textbook reading. Also, the practice tests included are nothing like the acutal AP test. Get Princetons or The Smartypants' Guide to the AP Environmental Science Exam, both of which are infinately better."
5,Very Entertaining,Another entertaining DVD by Nitro Circus. Our 9 yr. old son and both his parents enjoyed it very much. Worth the money.
5,The book I need to read about Jesus,"After many confusing interpretations of the teachings of Jesus and dogmas from religions and false prophets making money and living a good material life under the umbrella of Christianity, this is a very simple to understand book, and it came into my hands at the right time. Wright explain life in times of Jesus and his teachings very clear and from a neutral point of view. I recommend it."
2,From the TV show,"This book is a companion to a 1996 TV show. The first part (Jesus - Then and Now) consists of some modified versions of the original script, along with still photos from the show. It's well written, as you would expect a script to be, and the photos are great. Unfortunately there is nothing new here, although it is nicely packaged.The second part (Reading the Gospels with Both Eyes Open) departs from the original show, but again, there is very little original thinking here. Wright discusses the discrepancies in gospel accounts, the Jesus seminar, the Dead Sea Scrolls, dating the gospels, the Jewish influences, etc.There is no reference list nor any notes. The index is skimpy, but so too is the content.Bottom line - this is a well written and nicely illustrated sketch of some aspects of Jesus' life. It will not appeal to scholars and is of limited interest to beginners who will find it too truncated."
2,consider this,If your wall is not a flat surface the border does not stick well. We have a textured wall and we had the use wall paper adhesive to get it to stay. I also forgot to check how long the border was and I didn't order enough to go around the whole room. The last thing you should consider before purchasing is if it will match your decor. The border has a white background not see through. This didn't effect our room but the information might be useful to someone.
5,Easy to use,"I have been sewing since I was a child and wanted to add an inexpensive, lightweight sewing machine for a secondary backup machine. This machine is lightweight and easy to take places if I need to. I have another embroidery machine which is compatible to this one, I am very happy with the quality of the finished embroidery on this machine. This would be a great machine for a first time sewer and/or for someone who would like to be creative."
3,Brother sewing/embroidery machine,The Brother sewing/embroidery machine is basically quite good. My main complaint would be the threading procedure which has a distinct Rube Goldberg quality and could be much improved on.
1,Greatly Disappointed,"We, my wife and I, were expecting much more from this product. We were unable to load a bobbin! Despite several tries we were unable to get the machine to function as advertised and without a working bobbin we could not advance to any sewing. Thanks to Amazon we were able to receive a refund and moove on to a different machine. The mechanics of the Brother were not as advertised so we do not recommend it but the Singer Futura 350 we ended up with is extraordinary and is recommended."
4,Embroiders by itself practically,"Brother SE270D Computerized Sewing and Embroidery MachineGreat machine, so easy to use. Embroiders like a dream. Just remember to use a stabilizer(like a facing material) under. This is to keep the fabric from stretching. Extra cards are $40 for 20 designs. A bit pricey, I think. The PED basic to make your own designs is $140 and that is with only one blank card. Overall the machine works well for sewing and embroidery. Even my 10 year old daughter can run it. With supervision of course."
2,Hobbyist,"This machine is very tempermental. It jams easily and then tears holes in fabric. If all of the stars ""align"" you might get a couple good embroidered designs before it stops automatically threading it's self. I have read and reread the manual and am following the directions carefully, but I still find it has problems about 50% of the time. I'm thinking that I should have spent more money on a better model."
1,where did my negative review go?,"I wrote a very negative review a couple years ago about the Brother 270D and the auto thread cassette, and it seems to have disappeared! Do not buy this machine, the auto thread cassette is a piece of poor design, it can take me up to 30 minutes to get it to work finally."
2,Dissappointed,"I found that while the sewing machine can do many things,it is poorly constructed. I visited aa Brother Retailer who informed me that they not carry this machine because of the poor construction. They told me that I should be very careful with the thread cassette since they break easily and cannot be fixed and must be replaced which is costly.I find that sthreading the needle and winding the bobbin threads cumbersome and more complicated then is necessary. I still have not figured how to adjust the embroidery tensions to keep the thread from bunching up under the fabric.I am not a beginner when it comes to sewing and presently own a Viking 1100 and a White Serger. I bought the Brother as a way to get into the embroidery sewing. I still have the machine and will try to get it working to my satisfaction. If it breaks I will probably send it to the dump."
4,Gamecube- a very nice system,"I am eleven years old and I live in Florida and because it rains so much, I got this system and the racing game. I will tell the game gets boring after a while but if you come back to it later, it is very fun! About the system- although it does not have many games or accesories, the few games that are avalible or GOOD QUALITY GAMES not like the cheap, playstation games. Lets see how the gamecube competes with the playstation 2.DURABILITYGamecube A- If you drop it, It will scratch but it is still playable.Playstation2 B+ Not only does it scratch, have you ever seen ""DISK ERROR?""GAMESGamecube- B+ it does not have many games but they are excellent qualityPlaystation A tons of games (cheap though)Okay, thank you very much for reading. ILOVEGAMECUBE!!!"
2,Hope u can return it...,If u got a Gamecube for Christmas then i dont feel that good for u. Why? cuz its relly not too good. I mean the games are way too boring and childish and mario kart the game that comes with it is the only good game and that is not as good as the other racing games i have played so return ur gamecube if u got one.
2,Blah,"I ran across this cd by accident. I had no idea he had a new cd out, and I am a pretty big fan of Wyclef's music. But this cd was so blahzay. No song stuck out for me. Now I understand why I went so long without knowing about it."
2,Where's the rest of the content?,"For whatever reason, the folks at Metropolis decided not to include the second DVD with this set that is available on the PAL version of this DVD. Instead, they picked 5 tracks from the aformentioned ""disc two"" and tacked them on as an extra feature, so we in the U.S. just have a single DVD. It's very disappointing not to get the full length performances. In Transit (The Movie) is just that. It's documentary style with snippets of performances abruptly interrupted with interviews. I personally would have prefered just the Live in Germany DVD in its entirety over the movie. That said, the content you do get is pretty awesome."
3,Not a great live band?,"Having been a long time Covenant fan I had really high hopes for this album as I've never had the chance to seem them live. The collection of songs is great, but what really struck me is that they seem to miss on the performance.Inflection and tone found on studio recordings are completely missing in the live set, and many of the songs come off as flat or dull because of this. I was honestly really surprised."
1,Cheap,"This product does not work. I've tried to fill my ink cartridge 5 times, and it still prints with streaks. I thought after the first time I tried to fill it that my cartridge was just really low and needed extra time to refill. This was not the case after 5 tries. It prints better than it did before, but still low quality with streaks. I know it is not my printer as I have a new ink cartridge that I tried that works just fine, so it is not my printer but the cartridge."
3,Terrible release,Really bad album a little better then bacdafucup 2 dont get this i got it because am probably onyx's greatest fan that's why three stars in stead of one they need to get off d3 entertainment one of the worst recording labels ever and get back with def jam or whoever is running jmj records and come back with one more fire album and then retire legends5 of 10 lyrics 4 of 10 beats
2,what's the word I'm looking for here?,Don't get me wrong I like Bile and this cd has it's moments but it just doesn't hold my attention that long. I think it's because some of the tracks are either slow or boring. The whole thing is all over the place which is what I Like from Bile but it didn't workout on this album. I still like to listen to it now and then. Again it is a good cd and if you like Bile then you'll love it but don't buy this version because it's way too expensive. Buy Frankenhole because it's cheap plus you get this cd with suckpump. Even if you own suckpump you should still get frankenhole because it's so cheap and you can give suckpump to someone else and spread Bile around.
1,salt block,you get what you pay for i started going with there protein block instead and i will not use salt blocks again
4,"Great book, full of awesome ideas","This is a great book full of ideas for the adventerous carer and child/ren.I bought it because, as an early childhood teacher (in training), I felt that the chilren I cared for were restricted in the art they produced.Most of the activities in the book are perfect for about 2-4 children. In my case, where I have > 15 children, most of the activities need to be adapted. Some that the children loved without adaptation were ""Bubble Painting, ""Big Motion Crayon"".I thoroughly recommend this book just so we can get over the mindset that ""art"" has to look nice. I love that the children have fun just experimenting with materials and learning about their different properties and uses. The fun is in the making, not in the product."
5,Hollow Man is Great!!!!!!!!,Nevermind what others say because this score rules!!!!Track one through 13 are great but the best ones are 9 through 13.Jerry Goldsmith really out did himself here in MY opinion and he puts together some new sounds and tunes together in this soundtrack that we havn`t even heard before but only in our dreams so this is really a great sounding cd!This is just a sample that Jerry Goldsmith can make the greatest music in 2000 and later! I strongly suggest you get the Hollow Man and listen to this great music that Jerry Goldsmith mastered!
5,Great Album,"Same trax were released as ""Animalisms"" although that album in the U.S. has a few added ""bonus"" trax added(not sure which album came first). Good mix of catchy songs as well as a few great trax like ""Maudie"", ""What Am I Living For"" & ""Gin House Blues"". The versions of these songs on this album is fantastic. Highly recommended to any Eric Burdon/Animals fan - or to anybody who just appreciates good music !!"
1,Worst experience I've had with a router in years,"I have never had so many problems with a wireless router. I'm returning it and getting a different brand. I was getting about 10x worse than my previous 802.11g router with my desktop computer, and my MacBook Pro couldn't get a reliable connection even when sitting 5 feet away.This thing is supposedly great if you can configure it correctly. Sorry, Linksys, but you used to make routers that you don't HAVE to configure. I have better things to do with my time, so I'm going to buy one that works out of the box."
2,Range is very disappointing,"When looking for a wireless router for my house, I wanted the ability to take my laptop out on the deck or use it in any room in the house.I spent the extra bucks on the 300N even though the salesperson told me it was overkill in a 1,900 sq ft house.It was easy to set up and I had the wireless network up and running in well under an hour even though it was the first time I've set one up.The speed seems fine even when me, my wife and daughter are all online, but what is a major disappointment is the range. I get a great signal right next to the unit, but about 30 feet away my signal ranges from poor to low. Same when out on the deck even though I'm just outside the room where the route is located. There is no reception at all in some rooms."
1,Biggest piece of junk Linksys ever put out!!!!,"I got this router on the assumption that Linksys had a reputation from their earlier wireless B & G routers. What a mistake! This router does not do N under any circumstances. Even Linksys recommends that it should only be set to B & G and even that is also problematic. That should tell you something when the company itself admits its that N does not work on it. I smell class-action suit here. I also tried the WRT150N and its marginally better with 15 meg of memory versus the WRT300N 32 megs of memory. Both belong in its proper place, in the garbage!"
4,better than i thought,"product initially had some drops regarding wireless connection, but on playing around with the frequency settings, reception eventually improved.I later flashed the firmware with DD-WRT and this item is unbelievably rocking. Now it has more functions to play around with and pretty much performing above average."
2,Horrible setup utility,"The setup utility that came with this router was not able to find the router at first. On the third attempt it found the router but was unable to communicate successfully. There was no documentation with the router re: workarounds in case the ""simple"" setup program didnt work.Having owned an earlier Linksys, I tried to use the same OEM IP address and was finally able to configure it from my web browser."
4,Full factory reset required,"I am sure that this would have worked flawlessly using the installation CD with a big internet provider, but for the small local one that my apartment complex uses, it required more effort.The router's wired capacity worked flawlessly without effort, but the wireless configurations needed considerable work.After almost an hour on the phone with Linksys, we were able to reset the router and its settings back to factory default, change the wireless to g instead of n (standard channel width) as well as a few other settings, and manually add the network to my computer's Network center. After that, it worked flawlessly. To the seller's credit, the firmware was fully updated and I believe that the fault was due to the internet provider, not the router. It now works very well and I am satisfied with it."
5,Works great! fixed my air leaks!,"Pros:Fixed my air leaksPrice - less than $5Most auto stores have it (AutoZone, AdvanceAutoParts)Large tube allows for multiple usesDries fairly quicklyCons:None so farI used this product to stop an air leak between the midpipe and cat-back. The cat-back was an aftermarket part and the fitment wasn't the best. I have a dual exhaust and had air leaks on both sides. I applied the sealant while the exhaust was warm and then allowed it to dry over night. It was a really simple procedure, I applied a lot of the sealant all around the connections and even inside the pipes and this completely fixed the problem. It's been about a month now and still no leak. I'll see what happens in the future."
3,Water soluble?,Who knew? This product is apparently water soluble. Used it to try and seal a smoker chimney and the first good rain it was gone.
4,What you expect,"It does what you expect, that's about it. The construction is decent and great for normal everyday use. Like most other brooms like this it has a tendency for the handle to unscrew as you use it."
3,still toying with the camera,It came the same week . I guess I bought it for the vintage part but I am still learning how to take pictures.
5,An Unbeatable Resource,"I would consider this book required reading for anyone interested in ensuring their photography career is a profitable one! Focus On Profit is a sensible, easy read with a wealth of information about running a successful business.The computer software ""Photobyte"" that is included with it has streamlined my business more than I can say.I highly recommend this book."
4,L'equip 110.5,Can i use a strawberry?What kind of produce i can put in on it?There is a little rust on the blade basket.
3,THE UNICORN'S SECRET: MURDER IN THE AGE OF AQUARIUS,"I have no doubt that the material contained in this book is as factual as the writer portrays. I did find it difficult to keep up with the changes in time, setting and circumstances of the characters. Perhaps the writer feels that this is a way of sustaining the suspense, but I found it distracting. Overall, I was interested in this man who was recently brought back to the US to stand trial for the murder of his girlfriend. I did learn a lot about him and that is good background for what will inevitably be Court TV material soon. It might have been helpful to the reader to have a psychiatrist's view of Holly and why she did not leave Ira when she was obviouly drawn to another man. I almost gave up on this book before reading the ""secret"" revealed in the last chapters. Good account of Ira Einhorn who was evil before he killed Holly."
3,The world's Greatest club on disc!,"I bought this album/compilation the day after it was released. If you've ever been to Webster Hall, read no further, it's the same music that you heard inside the club. For those of you who have never been inside, let me show you. Tranzworld is a flavorful blend of today's house and electronic music scene, with mixes and transitions you'll miss if you're not listening hard enough. Would've given it 4 stars, except that some tracks are blended to the point that they sound like the same song. Beware, if you can't handle 160+ BPM, this is not the album for you. Instead you might want to try a Dance Mix USA or something along that line. To those who have experienced the Hall in all of it's glory, this cd is a must."
1,Among worst sounding music/choral DVDs ever encountered........,"My DVD library consists of hundreds of items, many, many of which feature large and small orchestras, individual singers, and chorus groups. I have never encountered, however, a orchestral/choral production as poorly recorded as this. My audio playback system is relatively expensive, with very good speakers, but I could do nothing when attempting to obtain anywhere near a satisfactory playback sound. Video qualities are satisfactory.Being able to look at these performers is secondary; in this type release, sound must be paramount. Potential buyers are hereby warned."
1,overly elementary,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a good starting point to get some new words into my vocabulary for the general GRE. I don't have an extensive vocabulary by any means, and even I knew at LEAST 85% of the words in this book. If you're looking to prep for a standardized exam, don't bother wasting your money or time on this book."
5,brass will not rust,I have a water well with a submergible pump and I got educated real quick when I used fittings other than brass. I will not use anything but brass fittings. I needed this fitting and it being brass I ordered it ASAP.
5,A must read that you won't be able to put down.,"The Story of a Soul is a magnificient insight into one of our most beautiful saints, St. Therese of Lisieux. Her story is an inspiration for all of us to find holiness in the 'little ways'. A pure delight written in easy to read language - a book for all ages."
3,A Hard Read,"We love spiritual books and heard about Sant Therese. The book is her story written in her own words. It is a bit hard to follow and understand what was so great about her. But, we are still glad to have in our collection. Maybe at a later date, it will make sense."
3,Real product not as cute as picture!,I bought this panda as a christmas gift for my co-worker. I made the purchase based on the picture but the real Panda is a little bit less than the pictures.
4,Cute and Cuddly,"My 3 year old is in love with Ni Hao Kai Lan right now and loves the China episode with baby panda, which inspired me to find her her own baby panda to cuddle. This seemed like the best bet and I am not disappointed! It just arrived today but already she has named it (Pandy) and has carried it around all day. She absolutly loves and adores this bear. Its soft and fluffy and cute. It is bigger than I thought it would be, which isn't a big deal, just thought he'd be a bit smaller. Also I think the picture is cuter than the actual bear, but my daughter doesn't care and thats what matters to me. I'm not one to buy stuffed animals usually but this is one I'm happy to have gotten!"
2,Not as advertised.,"I bought this as a gift for my niece and had it shipped to Calif., so I haven't seen it personally.My mother reported to me, however, that it was not 12"" as claimed but more like 9"". She also said the fur was not nearly the quality indicated by the foto.Another internet gotcha!"
3,Soft. Great Gift.,"Besides for one of the eyes being a little off, the panda is extremely soft and would make a great gift."
4,One of the best books on the subject,"There are not a lot of comprehensive books on Latin American Holidays (many on individual holidays, but few books that offer a solid description of multiple holidays). This book, though it focuses exclusively on the holidays and how they are celebrated in the United States, does manage to describe a number of holidays, and best of all, gives lots of ideas for activities (whether its recipes, or children's activity, or websites to visit for more information) that would work just as well in a classroom or in your own home, whether you hope to resurrect your own families' traditions, or create new traditions of your own. The layout is lovely, and the information is fairly complete, giving historical descriptions as well as descriptions of the traditions associated with the holiday. I highly recommend this book. Also note that the book is available in Spanish, under the title (I believe) _Tradiciones_."
5,Fantastic read,Fantastic read. Could not put it down. I have traveled in Ireland where the story takes place and it makes me want to go again....really soon.I hope the author has other books coming.
4,Attractive but too thin,I love the look but the holders are not think enough to handle extremely hot pans and pots. Recommended.
1,NOT WORTH THE COST!!,"Bought this for my son for Christmas to use as a stocking stuffer. Even though he is only 9, he is fascinated by geography. Though the ""book"" was only about $3, I didn't think it would be printed on such incredibly flimsy pages (thinner than an average magazine). The description made it sound more like a true book as it was described to fit in a binder. It also came in a less than flat status because it had been placed around another item in the box."
3,Fits SOME SKS rifles... does make a little difference,"I ordered three of these for my three SKS's- two Russian, one Norinco Chinese. I tried all 3 in each of the two Russians- nothing. They simply would not fit without cutting them down, so those two are going without (would not want a cut down buffer to come apart in the receiver when firing). The Norinco ate one up with minimal effort, so the other two buffers are in a drawer, awaiting other later-model SKS's.Also, watch out when installing- the two forks on the upper receiver cover are sharp!As for in use impressions, the SKS has pretty minimal recoil to begin with, so I got this more to slow the cyclic rate a bit and reduce parts wear. Seems to work for that. Hopefully it holds up well- Mark W."
5,All of the Midsomer Murder Series are absolutely great!.,"All of the Midsomer Murder Series are absolutely wonderful! However I need to have them close-captioned or subtitled for the deaf or hearing impaired. I happen be hearing impaired and NEED them so and I buy every British mystery as long as it is so presented. I get very frustrated that a great many of my favorite shows are not SDH or CC and it would be a great service for the millions of your potential customers if these mysteries (Inspector Morse), Rosemary and Thyme,etc were sold in either of these ways. Please do take this very seriously."
1,Tmccormick,"DOES NOT COME IN ITALIAN!, I needed it to have some italian in order to understand! Was unhappy to pay for something not offered."
3,Not as good as the originals,"Now that the original manuals of DiGrassi and Saviolo are widely available on the Web, and Silver's Brief Instructions is likewise available, this work's shortcomings in presenting the actual stylings of Elizabethen swordplay are rather painfully evident. Most glaring is the way that ""Methods and Practice"" got Silver completely wrong, only referring to his ""Paradoxes"" and not once citing the in-depth, competent, incisive combat instruction available in Silver's ""Brief Instructions on my Paradoxes of Defence""."
5,Gift,"I got this as a christmas gift for a friend, and its still holding up strong. She hasn't used it as an actual ""stocking"", just decoration."
3,Fun but small.,"The stocking is really fun and cute. I love that it even has the tassles and fishnet stockings, however it is very small. Not in length but in actual space. I could only fit a small amount of candy in it. I was hoping it could be used as a yearly stocking for stuffing but it was clearly intended as a decor ONLY!"
2,"Cute, but not functional","The stocking is nice and has great detail, but it can't be used as an actual stocking. The leg is way too narrow to put anything inside. Don't buy it for function; buy it for fun."
1,Don't bother,The cheap reed fell out the first time I used it. Don't waste your money. Very disappointed and now must go through the hassle of returning and buying another.
3,works good but reed fell out,"I am a avid squirrel hunter and for me this works! first time I used the bark I was able to locate one. But If you shake it to hard the reed in the middle may fall and if your like me and live in the midwest it gets cold and the only calls you can use are the bark and distress, the chatter will not work in cold weather out sadly, I have to buy another"
2,Not what I hoped for.,"This is my first squirrel call. It doesn't do the bark, squeal that real squirrels do. I've sat on my porch and used it while watching the squirrels in my yard,,, they stop for a second, then go about their squirrely business. I think my expectations may have been a bit high."
4,Emotional,"The title of the cd speaks volume. However, the original album, ""I want to wake up with you"" should be made available besides the best."
5,Childhood Memories,"Listening to this album as a young person, it reminds me of the great times spent with my grandpa. The collection of songs are truly enjoyable year round. This cd is a true gem and if not purchased, you will miss out on a true treasure."
2,PC Pablum,"The tenor is fine, but the musical accompaniment is primitive. However, my main objection is that I do not at all approve of PC censorship and Bowdlerization. As if anyone who might be offended by the term ""darkey"" is going to be listening to Stephen Foster anyway! Get a life."
3,Strange but good,"When I first saw this film I was a little torn, I didn't know if I liked it but it became stuck in my head so many days after viewing it that I naturally assumed that it was good. Looking back, I belive it was just a case of the old ""stuck-in-your-head-for-days-kind-of-thing"" you know what I mean. Oh well, see it or don't see it."
3,Kin Ping Meh - self-titled (Repertoire),"The obscure German 'heavy progressive' band's first lp, initially released in 1971. There appears to be two different versions of this CD reissue - one has the original album's eight songs - the other has that + four bonus cuts. Tunes worth mentioning the ten-minute opening ""Fairy Tales"", ""Too Many People"", the somewhat raw-sounding ""My Dove"" and ""Everything"". Line-up: Werner Stephan - vocals, Willie Wagner - guitar, harmonica & vocals, Torsten Herzog - bass, Fritz Schmitt - organ & piano and Kalle Weber - drums. Might do good for fans of Wallenstein, Birth Control, Leaf Hound and possibly Toe Fat."
1,Does not look as nice in reality,"Really liked the looks of it on the picture, but was very disappointed to see it in reality. The quality of the cuts in the bone is very poor, it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise interesting design."
2,this is not the Japanese version either,usually Goodtimes has the Japanese versions of movies.This ain't one.
1,Hives,"Like many other kiddos who have used this lotion, it causes my daughter (6) to break out into one giant patch of of hot, red itchy hives EVERYWHERE the lotion has touched. In other words, head to toe. I would love to know what's causing it. It has absolutely no effect on my other 2 kids, aside from smelling lovely. :( Has anyone figured out what causes this??"
1,Another child with a terrible rash,My 19 month old broke out in a terrible red rash after using this lotion. 6 days later and the redness is gone but he still is covered in bumps and uncomfortable. From reading reviews here and on many other sites it seems like a lot of people have had a similar problem. Be careful!
3,Great but not a pump as shown in picture.,"I love this lotion. But i wanted it with a pump bottle like the picture depicts. So I ordered it online instead of buying this product at a retail store. When it arrived, it was NOT a pump. But this lotion is the best for babies!"
1,Please Don't Buy! Hidden Allergens,"Like many posters before me, this lotion causes my child to break out into a nasty, red, itchy rash where ever it has touched her skin. It promptly has been put in the trash.Please don't subject your child to even a spot check for this reaction. It is not worth it! We were up most of the night with my child. It is heartbreaking to see her in such pain.I had received some of this lotion as a gift and just grabbed it last night. Immediately after applying, she was a giant red rash.Stick with Aquafor, which keeps skin soft and we've never had a reaction to."
1,Rash!,My son has an awful itchy red rash from this! Don't use it! I feel awful because he is so uncomfortable
1,Burts Bees Buttermilk lotion,I put this lotion every where on my son except his face when he got out of the bath. When he woke up the next morning his skin was covered in bumps and severly red (his face was fine). I have seen a lot of other people complaining of these same results. I was wondering if any one has found what they thought to be the culprit. Thanks!
3,Crappy Delivery,"This product is good, but the delivery was horrible. I received the product and the DVD was bouncing around in the box. I don't appreciate this kind of delivery."
5,Alistair Rocks (plus he's extremely HOT!!),"Alistair is a great artist. My dad is in the military and he got stationed to England. We moved just in time to catch the last few episodes of Fame Academy, in which Alistair came in second. Even though I bought this CD in pounds it cost about the same but the CD is well worth it. Alistair wrote or co-wrote all the songs but 4 on this album. Alistair is a great guy having recently met him after a show he did at the Newmarket Racecourses July 16. So in my opinion he is very hot. (Ecspecially in person and he seemed to be great with younger kids since my little sister was there with me also.) So you'd be buying a CD in which the singer has a great voice, is good-looking, and a great guy. (What a package!) Overall, he is a GREAT artist with a variety of music that many of people of different ages can enjoy. (There were elderly women getting his autograph and singing along just as much as I was at the racecourses.) So buy the CD, you know you want to."
5,Wonderful quality for the money!,"I own two Nikon N80 bodies. I used to own Nikon lenses only. Then I had trouble with the Nikon zoom and traded it in for a Sigma. Funny thing - the Sigma focused more clearly and easily than Nikon's own lens! I also own a Tamrom 1.4 teleconverter which did not work at all with the Nikon lens - but it works beautifully with this Sigma lens. I recently got some wonderful closeups of butterflies using the teleconverter with this lens - hand-held! I highly recommend this lens.To add a PS: I wrote this review in 2001, and now in 2005 I still own it and it still works great, no repairs needed. It's a little bulky by today's standards, but great optics for the price."
5,Not just for the Rainer,"I bought this to put on my Trailblazer as they are virtually the same vehicle. The one listed for the Trailblazer is 10"" longer and I didn't need that space on the roof.Everything mounted fine, though I did go an buy longer bolts to mount the rack to the rails. I used locktite on all of the screws and bolts to keep them from coming out on the rough trails.Loaded it with 3 Contico storage lockers full of camping equipment for the family. It appears to be fairly sturdy and will hold what you need to. I will find out more in 3 weeks as we travel up the coast to Oregon and Washington."
4,hope is eveyrwhere,"When I feel like it's all pretty hopeless and pointless, I pick up Pronoia and get back in the saddle. Bob Brezny has all the evidence you need to keep this whole movie in perspective. Finally someone who can articulate what Fox News needs to know, there is no Evil plot!"
5,Great read,"Huge epic tome. Great value for the money (looks like a college text book!). Rob Brezney has always been a favorite, and this book supports it."
2,Tried to like,"I very much wanted to like this book, but it's really corny, doesn't go into great depth, and I found myself doubting many of the ""facts"" the author cites that are supposed to surprise me and/or make me feel good. But if you want a book with lots of kooky feel-good exercises, and you're really, really, really into the Burning Man Festival, you will probably like this book.Also, I get the feeling that the author is one of the many neo-hippie types who believes that in order to be liberated, a woman needs to be willing to sleep with just about anyone, particularly him, and not necessarily expect a call the next day. Not that I was looking for sexism, but it bugs me when I find it, and the fact that there isn't much of interest in this book for me makes its flaws stand out all the more.I do like my weekly Free Will Astrology horoscope, though."
4,A blessing from the universe,"I found Pronoia to be refreshing. How good it is to read about wild abandon in life and then read about the wonderful things that people are doing, thinking and learning. A positive message is provided for those of us who don't subscibe the the ""norms"" of society. Cequa"
1,Not a quality product,Fell apart upon wire insertion. what else to say. other belkin products usually higher quality. no name chinese imports are catching up very fast
4,Great volume,"This book and its companion volumes, already mentioned by previous reviewers, make up a large part of the material for the two Open University Latin courses in the UK. I am doing the first of these this year. It does start right at the very beginning for people with no previous experience of Latin but the learning curve is fast and you need to be prepared to work hard.It is a very detailed volume and the OU miss quite a lot of exercises out, which shows you that there is enough material here to keep you occupied for years and years, if you are just learning Latin for fun. I suspect most people buying this volume will be doing more than that though!Latin takes a lot of disipline to learn as I am finding out, and this volume and its companions will give you everything you need to know and more to reach a pretty high standard. The OU offer a diploma in classical studies of which the two Latin courses, based around this book, can constitute 50%."
1,Machspeed Trio flash music drive-M450-4010R,"I have bought recently(2 days back) this mp3 player. The manual did not mention any tech support contact. The enclosed warrenty card did not provide address to where the card to be sent. Very poorly written manual and it is not working as it is sated. I have connected to my PC (2000 OS) and try to copy music files on a 512 Ultra SD card. It says the card is not formatted. I have tried to format and it says""windows can not format the drive"" Format is not complete.When try to use with the new battary (supplied eith the unit) it says""hello"" and ""01 err"" There is no reference of this or nay error in the manual.I am regretting on this purchase and I am planning to give this as a gift to some one. This way it will be somebody's headache."
3,Dutch/English: Level 1: VocabuLearn: Original Format,I bought some Dutch conversation cassettes. They are useful if you plan to visit the Netherlands as tourist. This is third which I bought. I think I prefer last one rather than previous ones. Because there are lots of vocabulary include expressions not only for tourist but also for daily use. it's enough for me in this moment to be familiar Dutch sound and increase vocabulary. So this is good cassette for beginner like me. but later I have to buy another books because there is no explanation of grammar in this book.
2,not as good as online reviews,"Though a tad more revealing in some ways, it had much of the usual not too great stuff that you see on these videos. I fast forwarded through much of it."
4,MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WILL RELATE TO THIS !,"Wonder how many young listeners have heard a teacher speaking to them in a stern voice, saying ""I'd like a word with you."" Whether they have or not they'll surely relate to Adam Canfield who seems to spend a lot of his time in hot water.Voice performer Patrick G. Lawlor gives energetic voice to Adam as our hero muddles his way through school, and learns a few things on the way. Being the coeditor of a school paper, in this case, the Slash, is never easy. Somehow, his sidekick, Jennifer, knows much more about people pleasing, and a persistent third grade reporter turns out to have an advanced-for-her-age nose for news.The trio face a dilemma when their run-ins with Principal Harris appear to becoming out and out warfare. Question is whether or not the kids can face down this powerful who has broken more than a few rules.Highly recommended for upper elementary and middle schoolers.- Gail Cooke"
5,good story,"My son, who is an avid reader, loved this book. He is begging for anything else by this author."
4,Busy boy uncovers shocking school scandal,"Adam Canfield is a high achieving, overscheduled middle-school student. He runs from class to after school program to his job as co-editor of the school newspaper, THE SLASH. He's often late. Good thing he has his best friend Jennifer as co-editor, who seems to keep her cool no matter how hectic life gets. They are a good team, especially when dealing with a third-grade journalist wannabe. When this youngster writes her first story she uncovers a school scandal that only Adam and Jennifer can manage to expose.This is a funny, quick-paced novel for middle-grade readers with nice characters and friendships.Lisa ArdAuthor of 'Fright Flight, Dream Seekers Book One'"
4,"A few rough ends, but all in all a good cd","Some might say these two are better than K-Ci & JoJo, to be completely honest, I would have to say they are about the same. Both groups have fabulous songs and such. Both have awesome and yet horrible songs as well.I know music, been writing music for years now. Music is my life. I Never really heard of Ruff Endz untill one day I found a cd single in my car, which ive never seen in my life, so I pop it in and its the single for the song ""Someone To Love You"". I was surprised that it was good.All in All a GREAT cd and a GREAT group. Not the best but who is, seriously now, its all opinion. If you like K-Ci & Jojo you'll like Ruff Endz. If you DO NOT like K-Ci & Jojo you'll still most likely enjoy Ruff Endz.The best songs on the cd is:Someone To Love YouWill You Be MineYouBiggerSure Thing--------------------My Rating System is based on Amazon's:* = Hate It** = I Don't Like It*** = It's Ok**** = I Like It***** = I LOVE IT!--------------------"
4,"Quote, ""It takes two to make a thing go right,.."" unquote.","The second CD by Ruff Endz is my first purchase by this duo, and from what I heard, it was pretty cool. They seem to have a thing for being the tough, yet sensitive heroes. Songs like ""Someone To Love You"", ""Will You Be Mine"", and ""You Mean The World To Me"" give out that heartfelt vibe that will attract romantics, while ""Cash, Money, Cars, Clothes"", with guest Memphis Bleek, will keep the hip-hop/soul crowd dancing and rocking. Reminding me a little of K-Ci & JoJo, the songs seem to be interchangeable. Each duo could sing the other's songs and, maybe, no one would notice. Still, this duo performed well enough to garner my purchasing future recordings."
1,ego problem,"boy is this band full of itself. go see them live to feel the full effect of the frontman's total and complete infatuation with himself. there are a couple of admittedly very remarkable melodies here, but the pompousness of the delivery is too unconscionable. too big for their britches by half. the lyrics? way self-consious and clever for cleverness' sake. sold it back, back, back. used bin!"
1,Don't Buy This,I bought this for a Motorla T721. Poor fit - top half is too tight; thought I was going to break the phone. And the clear plastic is not so clear - it has speckles and blemishes. I kept wiping the plastic off because I was convinced it was dirty. I regret buying this and urge you not to waste your money.
1,Worthless - Can't tweeze a single thing!,Can't tweeze a single eyebrow or hair with these Easy Grip Slant Tip Tweezers. Do not buy this product. CC
4,perfect grandpa (or grandma) book,"As a school librarian, I would not recommend this book for library shelves, but it is a perfect hands on book to share with little ones, one on one. The 'adult' will love taking the tools off the page and making them work, probably more than the little one will! This book will be good for hours of entertainment for young and old alike. So creative! I have not seen anything else like it."
3,Warning - Not for all age groups,"I just received this book, which I had ordered for my 15 month old nephew. I was disappointed to find a warning label on the front which says that the book is NOT for children under 3 and that there are many small pieces which could be a choking hazard. Any book which contains a warning label on the cover should have the same warning listed prominently in the description."
5,This is a great interactive book,"I am a nanny. I get this present almost every year for any family I work with that has 3yr to 5yr old children. This book is not for children who are hard on their toys. This book is great because children can play with the thick cardboard toy tools in the book or around the house. Any child that I have ever sat for has played for about 30 min with this book at a time. You have to remember that this book is not a toy, but children love to play with the tools so much that you would think it was one. Any book that can keep a 4 year olds interest for 5 min. is a keeper in my book. Plus they are learning at the same time...without something that requires batteries!! Goodluck and I hope you find this book as enjoyable as I know your children will."
4,great little zoom,The zoom range and macro mode make it a very useful all-around tele-photo lens. I have taken some very sharp macro shots and have had no problem with vignetting.My interest is urban wildlife and this lens can cover just about all my needs. Its range and macro mode make it the lens I keep on my camera. I use a manual SLR and have not had a chance to test the auto-focus.
4,Melinda's reviews of swivel wheels for lawnmower,"The swivel wheels work great on a flat surface, the only problem I've encountered is mowing on an incline. Then the mower whats do roll down hill and it's hard to keep going straight. I've learned to keep the pins in when I'm not mowing on a flat surface."
4,repalcement wheels,wheels are a great replacement of oem wheels. The wheels works well on a level ground. You have to be careful when cutting on an angel. Other than that it works very well.
4,simple solution,"I ordered this product instead of spending 400 dollars on a new mower with the swivel wheels. Installation was very quick and simple and after using them I like them as much as I thought I would. True that on a small hill you have to watch where your going or you will drift sidways. I like the product and would recommend it to anyone. I read that certain models of mowers had to be modified but my Toro wheels came off and these went on without any problems. Also, to adjust the height is simple compared to the mower with swivel wheels."
5,"The Steps, a great book! By Mallory","The Steps is a great realistic fiction book by Rachel Cohn about a girl named Annabel Whoopi Golberg. Annabel lives in New York City with her Mom and Grandma because her parents are divorced. When her best friend tells her that she is going on a trip for Christmas, all their shopping plans have been ruined. Her mom told her that she already got a ticket for Annabel to go to Austrailia for Christmas. Her Dad, Jack, lives in Australia with his wife, Penney, and her disasterous kids, Lucy, Angus, and new baby Beatrice. In photos that Jack has sent her, the kids look so mean weird. Is this a chance for her to get her Dad back? I liked this book because I think it tells a great story. This book is perfect for people of all ages ecspecially those who like when books take sharp turns."
1,Save your money,"First, it should be known that this book was published in 2001 and therefore all the stats (which would be the one thing in here that could be useful) are meaningless. Secondly, the paragraphs describing each college lend no real insight into what actually makes each college unique - rather it is a compilation of ambiguous descriptions and statements. This book was a real let down for me. My advice would be to visit the school websites or access other internet resources for information. Save your money and use it to buy an ice-cream cone. You will be happier."
1,Please.....,"First off, what hell is with the bashing on puddle of mudd for. But im sorely pissed off about this tribute. man i think the ppl who did the covers should all be shot. Its trash, dont f**kin buy it, if you do, your as worthless as the cd."
1,for true John Dunning fans only,"If you are such a John Dunning fan that you want to see his early efforts, read this book as research. This book is really not very good. Booked to Die and Bookman's Wake are terrific. As for the Holland Suggestions, well, everyone has to start somewhere. And I'm sure its a better book than I could ever write..."
3,Not his best!,Doesn't compare to THE BOOKMAN' WAKE and BOOKED TO DIE. But the last 3/4 is worth the read.
5,The Best Game for Generations,"i bought this game at my local thrifty shopper a few days ago for $2 and it's sooo fun!! i don't recommend this to young children unless they're not easily prown to nightmares. the graphics are excellent and great for any age!! the point if this game is to unlock all 3 parts of 5 nightmare creatures and to do that you have to look EVERYWHERE in each nightmare. some are irritating because you first think you looked through the whole nightmare when you clearly have not! and you have technically 8 tries to beat the game. Actually you have unlimited tries but if you beat the game within 8 tries, you get the ""official"" ending, whereas if you don't finish it with in 8 tries, you get a completely different ending. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME!! GO FIND A COPY NOW!!"
1,"The ""Real"" Pancho Villa?","Mr. Pinchon certainly had a vivid imagination, to say the least. His book is more in the style of the old ""Penny Dreadful"" westerns than an accurate and historical look at the life of Villa. I'm sure that some of the events portrayed in this historical NOVEL may have actually happened, but this ""inside story"" is badly flawed. It is a very interesting book from the aspect of the tripe that the American Public was fed about Villa following his 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Pinchon was certainly no Zane Grey or Louis L'Amour, but if you like old-timey shoot-em-ups, you will probably enjoy this book."
5,My girlfriend hates this!,It is perfect for poker night and other important events (visits from the parents). I may be reordering soon as I think mine may have found its way to Goodwill. :-(
2,"I'm Not Impressed, B","While An Albatross might be decent at what they do, they succeed in spades at beating a dead horse. A few listens and one can recall immediate contemporary influences such as The Locust, Mohinder, or from a classic band like Nervous Gender. To their credit, however, of all the cluttered groups in the underground, they are better than most. But I'm not impressed by that.If you're expecting anything ahead of it's time, look elsewhere. This reeks of the same rehash from the ever so familiar post-Gravity Records era that is the bee knee's with today's hipper-than-thou imposters."
3,She is not commander material,"Interesting how a person can be permoted who can't control themselves. Do enjoy seeing sights of London, especially the old building"
3,good quick fix,"Product works well temporarily, but due to the alcohol content, it will dry out your hair over time."
5,Good,This worked well and is exactly what I wanted. Awesome buy thank you. I love seasons on DVD and this is really good quality for an older DVD thank you
4,An English View,"It seems virtually impossible for anyone outside the USA to find any form of realistic guide to the best narratives or texts on American history by Americans.Whereas English history, French history, Russian history, etc. etc. has its recognised 'authorities', US history seems to have a collection of 'pro' tradition or 'con' tradition writings.Walter Lord's book 'A Time To Stand' may have its detractors and its supporters but in the simplest of terms it does actually tell the story of the siege of the Alamo including the build up and the aftermath. Further reading may be a good move for in depth study but this book gets the reader into the history itself with very little forced interpretation of possible fact or rumour or political spin.For the non-USA reader who just want to know what happened it's a must."
1,There are much better books,"If you want a complete book of witchcraft, check out To Ride A Silver Broomstickby Silver Ravenwolf. It is much better, much easier to comprehend, and more geared tohuman level. Buckland seems sturgent and unrepeled in his view, it is also too Saxon orientedafter all he is seax wicca.Buy to ride a silver broomstick if you want a book!"
1,Anti Family / Anti Love,"This book has the nerve to tell us that Wicca is a family religion because your coven becomes more important than your real family. It encourages teans to turn against their parrents in exchange for artificial bonds that will inevitably fail when you need them most.I am sickened at the word ""Complete"" in the title as if the author is the Pope of Witchcraft. This is most certianly not complete as it contains none of the heart and soul that this beautifull religion offers.But then again, what should we expect from an author that has flat out said there is no room in the craft for homosexuals? Skip this one and purchase either Cunningham, Farrar, or Drew."
4,Practical NOT Spiritual,"Are you interested in the study of Wicca and its history? Then this book is for you. Buckland gives his point of view without a lot of spiritual undertones. Based upon Gardinarian Witchcraft perhaps you would actually be considered a 3rd degree upon completion of this 'Workbook', but how one can accomplish this task with no guidance or physical teaching is beyond me. Will you get some new ideas about Wicca? Yes. Will you get a good history of the Gardinarian Sect? Yes. Will you find spiritual enlightenment and be able to transend upon workbook completion? Probably not."
5,This is a must have,"Buckland is one of the best wiccans well known (because of the relationship with Gardner) and has put together a very good resource money can buy. I cant express this enough for any wiccan that is advanced or just a beginner, you will smile with delight and thank yourself for getting such a gem."
3,"Not bad, but not the best....","... Like a lot of the other reviews here, I agree that Buckland seems to present a lot of this book as the end all, be all guide to Wicca. Everything in the book is from the position that the reader is primarily interested in Saex-Wica (the tradition he founded); there is very limited information on the other paths available, if any at all. Also, the amount of topics touched upon in the book, coupled with the lack of information presented on these topics, makes me think that the book might be a bit overwhelming to a newbie to the Craft. My only other gripe is that in my opinion, this book seems to give the impression that anyone can wake up, decide they're going to be a pagan, and form a coven with just the knowledge in this book."
1,No credibility.,"In my opinion, any book that cites Uri Geller as an example of someone who can manipulate energy with his mind has no credibility whatsoever...."
2,used to be good,"This book used to be part of the reading list of my coven and was essential training material for neophytes for the last decade. I now recommand and use for my own students Sean Belachta's ""The Coven leader's handbook"" as essential reading. Raymond Buckland's book lacks the depth of other authors and misses much of the oral tradition - which is essential in understanding and working wicca."
2,For the technically oriented.,"By practice, I'm more a philosophical Pagan than a ritual-oriented one. This book, while full of interesting ideas, was far too cut and dried for little ol' me, who's trying to learn the emotion behind it all. Perhaps nice reference, but not for people like me."
3,kind of strange,"This is my first book ever reading in Wicca and I mean I have read all the reviews so I'm guessing there isn't a lot of bondage and other kinky stuff in covens... hopefully? I didn't like the fact that he pretty much excluded the importance of family I found some information useful like his meditation techniques and the history and the now of witchcraft etc., but almost everything else just seemed well a bit ridiculous."
2,It's not complete trash,"If this is the first book you read on Wicca, you'll probably love it. I, personally, have a problem with anyone who feels the need to quote themselves as much as Buckland does. Or to refer to his own other books for suplimental reading.I found a lot of the theories quite questionable, and found very few palatable morsels hidden therein."
3,Not Bad,"This book has some interesting info to share. Not quite as good as The Truth About Wicca and Witchcraft by James Aten in my opinion, which I find better suited to the solitary practioner, but this could be a good place to start with some basic exercises for the beginner."
5,very informative,Explains things in an easy to understand format. I also like how well organized all the information in the book is. I have read lots of books on the same topic and always come out more confused than I started. This book does not do that though.
4,good intro to witchcraft and magic,I found this book to be a very simple read. It covered alot of basics and made alot of sense.
4,Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft,"A good starting point for anyone interested in the initiatory stages of covens, but difficult to complete some of the lessons if you're a Solitary. Good, sound background knowledge in the basics of the Craft, but no in-depth study of any particular tradition - good if the student has not decided on their own Path. Wouldn't say it's 'complete', but pretty close!"
3,Great background and insight for beginners,"This book would have been better without the quiz portions and referenced reading. I'd prefer a book that you can read straight through. Buckland's constant request that you stop reading and read other books before continuing is a royal pain and had me putting the book down as I wandered in different reading directions. It's almost as if he never wanted you to finish reading this book. And as for the quiz portions at the end of each chapter....does anyone ever actually take these quizzes? This book makes it hard for anyone to finish the book to completion. Other than that, the book is filled with wonderful background/history insight."
4,A great place to start,"if you are intrested in the magikal arts this is a great work book to get a general idea of what ""witchcraft"" is about i sugest it to all beginers"
2,Who needs valium?,"This book is rather dry, dull and boring to read. It's geared mainly for his creation of Seax-Wica, and isn't a great book for those of an eclectic path. However, it does contain some good reference information, so it's not a total loss to buy."
2,Out of date and overly dramatic.,"Reading this book as a modern Wiccan is like watching an old episode of Star Trek when you are a fan of the Next Generation. This book has value in that you can use it to see why Wicca was not very popular until the wave of books that have come before Scott Cunningham, A.J. Drew, Beth, and the modern authors who have placed soul into the religion."
1,Interested? Read on...,"This is dangerous territory to be in. You risk the wrath of God, and damnation. Don't go there!"
3,"how to, but not why","It's not that this book isn't helpful. It is. Buckland packs as much pure info and how-to in these two hundred fifty some-odd pages as possible. In the prossess, however, he manages to remove all semblence of poetry and mystery from the craft. This book is an excellent how-to, but it's about as inspiring as Time-Life DIYs."
3,All the reviews,"Well I have been reading all the reviews, not only for this Buckland writing, but also for the others listed under his name. It seems that maybe some misunderstand this writer. Everyone takes from all books whatever they need to read or believe. Otherwise they would research on their own. As a written work it is well done. As to the informative value of fact versus fiction, that's another question entirely. If the writer is inventing his specific craft or if it actually exists is really of little consequence."
3,Lots Of Information BUT not Complete,"I am just starting out on my search for my spiritual self, and I was little disappointed. After reading thru the whole book it really doesn't touch bases on anything of a spiritual nature. The information that was given was easy to understand and will proove to be helpful along the way I'm sure."
4,Good Beginner Book.. Explains alot,"Okay I have to admit this book does read like a shop manual. BUT, it is very informative and is a good book to start out with. Raymond Buckland makes a good point by addressing things in the order they needed to be addressed. I really appreciated how in depth his explanations are. I like the way he seems to address the questions running through your head before you even get a chance to vocalize them. Definately a must.. and I see why this book stays around."
3,"Full of info, but...","This book is full of great information and is very helpful, but it's also very ""this is how it's done, and you must do it this way"" (well, for the most part). It is mostly coven based, and beyond that it is Seax-Wicca based, because Raymond Buckland did create that tradition after all. I do recommend this book however, because as I stated before, it is full of helpful information, and it will help broaden your views on all the different ways of doing things."
5,Unparalleled in reference material for any witch!,"A great piece, this book offers a more interactive approach to witch craft than other books but had unparalleled detailed crafts in it as well. If you like textbooks, it our also orientated in that style while being very reader friendly as well."
3,"Great, informative, but would take years to complete","I like this book because it tells beginnings and origins, but on the same hand, this book would take about 2 or 3 years to complete because of necessary supplies. But honestly, I wouldnt spend my money on it. Real witches dont need tools except insence burners, candles, candle holders, and stuff like that. I have been practicing 4 years and am yet to need a atame, alter, or wand. Any witch with experience should agree with me. But it wont get cureous un informed teens into trouble like many other books Ive waisted my money on ovr the years. Blessed Be"
3,Uncle Bucky's Blue Book,"This book does provide good background history and information that new-comers to the religion would find necessary to become ""functional"" within the Craft...however, Buckland does not keep in mind that many members of the Craft today are solitary members, writing the ritual only for groups. The rituals themselves are rather dry, but can be used as outlines for writing your own in the future. The chapters, while containing useful information, were unfortunately written in a manner that made it hard to sit still and read through. Once again, rather dry. Also, he does focus more on the English version of wicca than any of the others. While this would be good for reference, I would suggest you augment it with other books for beginners, and use this simply as a back-up reference."
4,This is a great book for ritual Wicca!,"I like Buckland's idea of bringing ritual back to Wicca. After all, the very purpose of ritual is to enhance focus. He does, however, present a series of rituals that would be difficult for a beginner to follow. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who is new to Wicca, but for someone who has been studying for a while and would like to bring ritual back into their practices, this is an excellent source of ritual information and ideas."
1,horrible cd,"Good Charlotte is my favorite band, but, this CD TOTALLY butchered some of their best songs (i.e., Screamer). Not only does the singer sing horrendously, but they messed up the melodies (esp. in Story of My Old Man) and the music sounds weird. It's not worth the money. This CD takes some really great songs and makes them sound horrible."
2,Not as described,"Walnut Tradition Kitchen Scissors (ASIN: B00005AM7R) do not have ""Comfortable wood handles secured with triple-brass rivets"", they have unattractive chocolate-brown plastic handles.The bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature, and simply get in the way."
1,Please.,"!Heather's Teenage Son!Rap in the early to mid 90's was really quite good, but after 98, it really started to get horrible and they began rapping about doing their girlfriends and how much money they have. Do they really think people care about how successful they've become? I know I sure don't. Freek-A-Leek is another generic 'girls, secx & money' single. Petey Pablo DOES have ALOT of talent, but he wastes it, thus making this single not worth the small price I can buy it for at K-Mart."
5,Fantastic performances,"Mother Ghost is one of those little movies that sneaks up on you and truely catches you by surprise. Looking at the cover you can see it is packed with actors that have been doing 'this' for awhile now and know their way around a set. With the exception of one, that being Mark Thompson. This movie is actually his brainchild, his blood, sweat and tears if you will. And after watching it you will never believe that this is his first starring turn in a movie. He has done tons of very small parts on various tv shows and movies, including his own tv show on NBC in the early 90's but he is probably more famous for his voice. He is one half of the Mark and Brian Radio Show eminating from Los Angeles and broadcasting over the US. The aforementioned show he starred in for NBC was The Adventures of Mark and Brian and was the very 1st, THE VERY FIRST, reality TV show. His acting, his performance is the one you will be talking about long after the credits have ended."
3,A D-Link CardBus Adapter,"This D-Link was good enough to use in testing a laptop. This was - and will be used to see if laptop's are using their own connection or needs an outside source - like this D-Link purchased. It turned out to be that this card was not needed. Maybe someday someone else will get a card just like this one to compare and test to see if a laptop like this one needed an outside card or not. It helped and I only hope, if I need to use it again I will not misplaced or loss it."
1,Electronics for Dummies,"I have a 7in. Asus Laptop and I thought the D-Link CardBus Adapter, 32 bit would work with this laptop. Either I don't know how to connect it or it doesn't work with my computer."
1,Mac OSX Kernel Panics,"This is a strange one. On MacOSX 10.2.8, it works fine with the DSL modem at 10M, but is a disaster with the school network at 100M. And by disaster, I mean: Kernel Panics. It's the kind of crash where everything stops, the screen dims, and you get the ""you must restart your macintosh"" in four languages. To address this, I did the following: 1) re-installed the driver (1.1.3); 2) re-installed OSX 10.2.8; 3) re-installed OSX 10.2.8 without preserving user or internet settings; 4) erased my MacOSX partition and re-installed everything from scratch. Still, I get kernel panics within 10 minutes of going online at 100M, and at no other time (even with the card used for 10M dsl; even when card is plugged in but not attached). Note: user reviews of d-link's USB wi-fi dongle for MacOSX record a similar problem.Until this problem is corrected, I strongly recommend against use of this card for MacOSX 10.2.8 installations."
5,Easy Install,"This should be a one two three for installation. After install disc was finished with laptop, it was as easy as plug and play, connected easily to network."
3,Love the Star trek Voyager.,"I love the series. Season five was pretty good, but not as good as the rest. It was more about life on the ship than all out dangerous adventures they had before."
2,Disappointingly Shallow,"I have been a ""ministry wife"" for 4 years now, and my husband ordered this book for me. While the contributors to the book are a group of women whose husbands I respect, I was highly disappointed by this book. The ""devotionals"" in this book are 10 second sound bites of a single scripture verse with a personal story to loosely illustrate it. Perhaps this would be good for a new Christian who needed an easy introduction to studying God's Word. . .perhaps? But ministry wives need the meaty Word of God, which is useful for training in righteousness! How can we expect to encourage our husbands and the flocks under their care if we are not women who passionately study God Himself, theologians in the truest sense of the word!"
3,"Keep Looking, Don't Buy","I bought this particular trike for my 22 month old and wanted to stick with the ""classic americana"". What a mistake! If I still had the receipt, I would return it. This trike tips very, very easily. It is difficult for a younger child to learn to steer, therefore, the adult push bar SHOULD come in handy. However, on this particular model, the adult push bar is completely useless. You cannot assist with steering, if you do, you will tip your child. The adult push bar is only useful for a straight line ride. I wish I had bought a more durable, sturdy trike!"
3,Double Eagle M83,"GUN: The gun itself is pretty decent, but you'll have to get a better battery because it comes with a 7.2 volt which makes the gun so weak it's unable to penetrate cardboard from 1ft. away, also the gun is kinda loud but I don't really mind.MAG:The mag is decent as long as you don't drop it,I dropped mine and it broke plus you should get 1 or 2 extra mags cause the mags only hold about 40 rounds each.ACCESORIES: Mine didn't come with a laser or flashlight, which is no big deal(not the manufacturers problem it was airsplats), but the red dot scope is barely visible outside, the grip is pretty firm and the sights are ok,and last but not least the sling it comes with is ok but the sling mounts are plastic so the might break(mine hasn't broken yet but I kinda expect it to soon)So all in all, the gun is decent for begginers, mag is ok,and accesories are ok. This gun would be good for backyard wars but nothing else.Hope yall found this review helpful!"
1,Broke after one day,"I got this as a gift for a buddy of mine. We were both excited when it came, it came with so many extras like a flashligh, laser, etc. The glasses were broke but who cares. But then after only using once for about 30 mins the first day, the rifle stopped working on the second day. First the full auto stopped working, then single shot stopped working as well. Tried charging the battery for a full day, came back and still didn't work. This thing looks cool when you get it, but is a piece of crap once you use it. I would not recommend to anyone."
1,WAIT!,Do not buy this item! The magazine does not feed the bbs correctly so it will not fire. Also returning this item costs as much as it is worth. Save your money for a quality gun like the crosman pulse r76.
1,not happy!,This gun is no good. One of the screws that hols in the back sight won't screw in. And the connection to the charger doesn't fit together correctly. The 31.49 that I paid for the gun isn't the issue but the 72.00 I paid for the shipping really pisses me off for a gun my kid cannot use!
4,good gun,This gun is great for spraying people in the face and keeping on your back for a secondary. Also comes with all the attachmets you could ever want. The fps is 250.If you are a beginer I would sugest it but if you are a hard core air softer you might break it because its plastic but it hasnt failed me yet and ive had it for about 2 months now.
5,Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle,"First airsoft I own. My kids and I love it. For the price you can't expect much more. It works great, no issues, those little balls will leave a welt on bare skin from about 12ft. We plink indoors on small objects and its lots of fun. I was thinking of buying a real AR-15 but then it's too much of a hassle to go to the range, come home and clean. This is easier."
4,great gun buy it before the price goes up again,great gun for beginners can be inacurrate but use .20bbs theyll fix that other wise no big problems besides assembly and getting the battery in and out. great gun! i reccomend to all older then 13. P.S. i rated 4 stars cuz getting the battrey in and assembly is annoying but its a geat gun.
4,Amazing by for price,This is a great gun for beginners and medium leveled players. The accuracy isn't the best but overall i love the gun its a good size and alot of fun and there are alot of attachments
2,"Good gun, for beginners","This m83 rifle is an okay gun, if you are a beginner, this m83 would probably not be the best gun for a war. I had this for about 8 months and recently try mprod broke and could not get it fixed, the scope is cheap, also mine did not come with a laser, but for 30$ it is an okay gun"
5,purple hurtle turtle,this gun came way late and would me good only 4 a beginner1st or second gun recommend for a beginner
1,Mine was sent opened already and looked used,"I bought mine from hitguns/hot-import-toys and they didn't even ship it in a box. I paid $15 for shipping too. They wrapped it in brown paper and sent it just like that. When I received it today the plastic was already ripped off and it looked used. There were no batteries in the box and only a few bb's were included NOT the 100 they said will be. The safety glasses that were included are cracked. Obviously, they sent me a used one BUT I paid full price for a new one plus shipping. I should be refunded just for the hassle. Never had such terrible service before. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!"
2,this gun is built for noobs,when i opened it i was surprised how much stuff came with it but the first airsoft game i went to it with i ran out of ammo in 5 sec i sold it at a yard sale for 8 bucks DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
2,DO NOT BUY,"This gun is the terrible! it shoots like 240 fps or something which is complete crap. I have never seen such bad accuracy and power. The only decent thing about this piece of garbage is that it looks pretty cool and it comes with a bunch of attachments. So if your are thinking about airsofting with it, Big mistake. If it is just to have for no reason and your only going to shoot around with it, then I would say this is the gun to do so with. this is an easy 2/5 for its terribleness in power and accuracy."
2,Good for the price.. As long as it doesn't break after 2 days..,"When I got my gun I was thrilled.. I have quite a bit of experience with airsoft.. I play a lot of battles with my friends and I have had about 15 guns.. Most of them were spring so this was only my 2nd or 3rd electric.. It shot relatively hard but not too hard i thought the clip was empty and i shot myself in the leg from about 6 inches away and it hardly stung.. I have a pistol with 200 fps and it makes holes in cardboard, this gun does not. I mean its 40$ which isn't bad at all but mine broke 2 days after i got it.. When I tried to shoot it would just make this shooting sound but when i took out the clip it was full.. I gave it a two stars because it was a good gun for 40$ but I would prefer it to last more than two days.."
1,fail,I Got this product hopeing it will be most powerful and for a cheap price but i was worng this product sucks waste of product and plastic
1,Heavy M4 M16 Replica Airsoft Gun Double Eagle M83 A2 Full Automatic Electric Rifle,"I don't know who is writting these reviews but it is clear they dont know what they are talking about. I bought this airsoft rifle and tested it. In fact I bought six different airsoft rifles, and this one was the worst! It barely makes a dent in a soda can at 10 feet! I mean barely... you have to really look for the dent. It bounces off card board at 10 feet, no marks. It has feed problems, and does not carry the rounds they say... total disapointment, and a waste of money!I am a Paintballer and airsoft doesn't compare!"
3,Missing parts,"The item was missing the laser sight. I contacted the seller, who told me they would ship out a replacement, but this never happened. The item itself works good and is fun to shoot. The accuracy leaves something to be desired, but I have not tried it with heavier BBs"
3,Does this gun have a metal gear box?,"So I just ordered this gun, but now I'm wondering if this thing has a metal gear box or not. Can someone please help me?"
3,Sweet,This is one of those guns for starters. I got it since i needed a cheap automatic and that's what i got. The magazine is a little janky and the FPS isn't that great but it's a good starter weapon none the less.
4,Great for awhile,"I loved it, but recently, the semi went out. The auto is slow, so i could still fire it on auto one at a time. More recently, the auto conked out too. It will shoot 2 shots, then just click. I havn't charged the battery in a whille, so that could be it, but this is a real drag, if that doesn't fix it, especially on a great gun."
3,Decent gun,"This gun took about 9 days to get to me. The shipping price was horrible, $20 to ship the damn gun. The delivery was pretty good, came in the box and wasn't damaged at all. Once I opened up all the packaging, I was pleasantly surprised. The gun is ABS plastic, decently heavy and feels good in your hands. The add-ons are all pretty good.The one major flaw with this gun is performance, which is a big one. It isn't very accurate and the bb's (.12 grams) curve up after about 15-20 feet. The gun isn't that powerful either.Overall, if your looking for a nice looking and decently performing gun, planning on playing backyard wars, this is a pretty good buy. Otherwise look for something different."
2,make pretty cheap,"You pretty much get what you pay for here. It was a cheap gift but it did not last long, the stock broke very quickly."
4,"Good knives, great value","For the price, these are fantastic knives. I've had no problems with them at all - and they're quite sharp. Best not to put in the dishwasher. They will rust if water stands on them, and the handles don't respond well to the dishwasher. The blades are thick and sturdy, unlike many steak knives in this price range. Treat them right and they will last! I'd buy them again."
1,"Run, while you can!!","The only thing worse than this print server was DLink's support. Bottom line it would print nothing but gibberish. The first level guy has no idea. The second level guy actually admits that he knows nothing about the device and that I have more documentation than he does because I have the manual that came with the device. Wow! They don't even let there employee's download the electronic documentation from the web. Might just be a defective device, might have been some port setting that the second level support department didn't know about. I don't know. What I know is that the second level support represntitive didn't have the answers so he asked for my name and phone number and let me know that a senior technician would call me back. ETA 48 to 72 Hours.Long story short returned the Dlink and picked up a Hawking Technologies, PN7127P Print Server for the same price....worked out of the box."
1,Just a mess...........nothing fine about it.,"I love Laurel and Hardy. I really think that Stan was one of the greatest comedians ever. Unfortunatly, you could never tell it by watching this misfire.What few good gags there are, never work because you're too concerned wondering if Stan is going to fall down and not get back up during the film.I honestly have found *every* Laurel and Hardy film I've ever seen to be enjoyable. (even The Big Noise) But I don't think I'll ever be able to make it through this one again."
3,Sam Harris,I love Sam Harris but now the tape won't play at all so I will have to buy a new one instead of another used one.
2,french language tape,I expected conversational french. I really don't need to count to 500 in French! It was not of any use to me before my trip.
1,Hate IT!!!!!!!!!!!,This show suck they are always trying to be some sort of perfect family and im so glad its not on TV ANYMORE THANK GOD!!!!!!!!
2,rip off,i got ripped off - did not get full set -box was half empty - supposed to get 16 only got 8 pls get in touch with me or mail me the remainder
2,Poor book,"I used this as the primary text in a University Math/Programming course. The book is very dry and hard to read. While the information in the text is correct, it is hard to imagine a more uninteresting and dry way to present the material. Pseudo code was unnecessarily difficult to understand. Same goes for the main math concepts, which often had to be explained at length by the instructor."
4,Great knife set for the money !,"I was very pleased when I received this knife set / block. These really keep a great edge and look very nice. It's obvious that they are built well, just as any Chicago Cutlery product is, and will last me a long time. They came VERY sharp.... and I was even able to get the chef's knife sharper yet. Great product !"
3,Mediocre Knives,"These are *not* premium knives, so don't think you are getting Wustoff/Henkels quality for less. They won't hold an edge after a few years of heavy use. My set(a gift)was junk within 2 years. I like one thing about their bread knife, tho. It has a long blade as opposed to other brands which are way too short to cut a round loaf. Otherwise it isn't very sharp and tends to munge up soft loaves. If you don't cook and just want something pretty these are OK, but if you use your knives alot you will just end up replacing these with decent knives."
1,Poor product / technical support is even worse,"If you are looking for a reliable, quality switch, look elsewhere. The first switch we received was DOA. Tech support turn around was more than a week, and they ship UPS ground. As a result, we had to rely on an old hub for over two weeks! The new switch worked well, for about two weeks. Then it too failed. If you need a reliable workgroup switch, look somewhere else. We gave up and replaced ours with a Bay Networks Netgear FS516 switch for about the same money and we can rest easy with good support. So far it hasn't broken either."
4,Good Network Switch,This is a decent network switch for the price. I would not run an enterprise on it but it is good for a small office or a home/office.
2,Cult Classic...I must not be in a cult,"I remember seeing this movie on TV back in the day. My sister had been trying to figure out what it was called, so I gave it to her on her birthday. I'm not sure if anybody stayed awake all the way through. It's very cheesy and very weird. I would love to see Mystery Science Theater commentate on it."
3,British Blood and Black Humour,"I had seen this movie as a child and it left quite an impression on me. Recently finding it on VHS was a joy, and it's held up over the years. Mind you, I have a LOVE of the lurid hodgepodge of genres that some of those Brit ""horror"" films were. This is camp and cheese and still quite enjoyable. The wah-wah-guitar soundtrack music, the bizarre images, the so-AWFUL-it's-great folk song burial sequence... The humour is sort of a low-rent version of DR. PHIBES, and well worth checking out, I think..."
5,Red Bull for the ears.,"This album is amazing, Brisk and Ham really pumped these disks with energy. Vibes run from the Happy Hardcore bubbly-ness of Euphoria to the frantic anger of Dreadhed. This is truly a Hi-Octane compilation, as promised by B&H themselves. Usually on a good mix, there are maybe three songs that I listen to regularly. Here, there is more than three times as much. This is the cream of the crop, a must buy for Hardcore fans. I'm even looking to buy volumes one and two."
4,'Doesn't matter what you fly...this is a Primer for Airpower Today,"Six years ago,when my peers and I were still largely focused on state-vs-state conflict, authors Corum and Johnson produced this superb text. It provides a solid historical context for airpower employment demanded by present and future US national security requirements.The reader will quickly note that the book is not filled with gripping tales of air combat - and this is hardly coincidental. The great value of this work is instructional rather than entertaining. Yet, as a career military aviator, I found the text highly readable as well as illuminating.I strongly recommend this book as a must-have ""101"" course for aviation and intelligence professionals from all services, particularly my own(USAF)."
5,Perfect for beginners who want to make their own sushi,"Not only does this book provide the basic tools, food ingredients, types of fishes, and basic techniques that is displayed them in an easy to read manner with beautiful pictures. This book also provides a little history about how sushi nigiri should be dipped in soy sauce with top side down, when to use more or less wasabi, and what's great is at the back of the book, it provides exact measurements of how much sushi rice to cook to accommodate how many type of rolls per person!This is a must have for those interested in making their own homemade sushi!"
4,Good basics sushi cookbook for your collection,"This was a good cookbook that covered the basics of making sushi. Things like equipment & utensils to use, ingredients explanations, how to fillet fish, cleaning squid, etc. There were a few creative ideas but for a creative sushi display but not for unique sushi rolls. Buying this book used and adding to your collection would be worth spending the money."
3,"not much dash, not much flash","I find the premise for the book really intriguing. I was hopeful to see meaningful projects done in a thoughtful way and many of the houses are interesting, but there's not a lot of originality here. If you follow architectural publications, you will recognize a number of the examples offered in this book. I was hoping for a bit more insight either into technical or philisophical reasoning behind the houses...I can accept that it wasn't the purpose of the book, which is fine if the projects are well photographed, but here again the book fell short. Exposures were not done properly and many of the photos were not crisp. From the various reviews I had read, and the level of quality on a number of other architecture books I've purchased over the years (and even the quality of photos in arch. magazines) I expected much more."
3,Nice coffee table book,A very nice large coffee table book with good picture quality. Unfortunately lacking in depth and details. Every house only has a few views with minimal descriptions. Not for the serious interior decor person.
4,Good lens for less money,"I bought this lens without getting my hopes too high. But it turned out to be a good macro lens. There are few short comings. 1. Auto focus mode - camera gets confused. 2. Good for only closeups. Long shorts gets bit blurry.Manual closeup works great. I finished one full role on this lens and generally the above rule applied to the picture. You can buy it if you are planning to use it only for closeup and you already have a good lens for you portraits, landscapes, etc. Best wishes"
4,Very sharp,"Very sharp knife that cuts through tomatoes and other vegetables easily. When I put it in the dishwasher, the handle tarnished after one wash. Because of that, I knocked off 1 star."
1,Where is the Item I ordered,Here is the problem ... I have not received this item as of yet and am disappointed at how long it is taking for it to arrive.
1,not a sequel to Tarkovsky's thriller,"This film is an independent softcore erotic film that is in no way related to Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"" film"
1,High Infant Mortality Rate,"Dont' waste your money. I bought this model after the previous model's anti-skip died two weeks after the warranty expired. I've had this about 8 months and it will not longer work with batteries, only external power. If I could give it zero stars I would. Two in a row is enough to convince me Panasonic makes junk and I'll never buy a Panasonic item again!"
5,If this is by Teresa Jeffrey it was very inspirational.,"There have been many times when I would be down and I'd put in Teresa's tape, ""Gathering of the Nations"" and I would find a newness in the Lord. I thank God for that tape."
4,A Good Book For Children on the Planet Neptune,"In August 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft became the first and so far only spacecraft to visit and explore the planet Neptune. The author presents a brief, non-technical summary of the mission to Neptune and the findings from this mission. The book is loaded with many high quality photos of the planet, its rings, and its minor moons. The book also contains a good deal of information on Neptune's largest moon Triton. While this maybe a children's book, I feel that many adults would find it interesting as well."
5,cockfighting all over the world,"A book that would be the envy of any cocker's personal home library. Comprehensive and most informative. Truly the ultimate cockers' reference book, A thru Z. I came across this book while researching cockfighting on the island of GUAM. Now I'm trying to acquire this jewel of a book for my own personal reference."
4,Great Value if your short a lab to practice in...,"I purchased this book so that I could position myself for upcoming technologies at my work. I was pleasantly surprised at how ""instructor"" like the CIM was. I felt like I had a full Cisco Instructor led course by the end. It took around 35 hours to complete the course in total. The simulations are just like telneting into real equipment. 90% of the commands work to a degree but some have been disabled, I think to ease the burden onthe simulator. Which is why I knocked off a star. The labs are well thought out and make you think more as you progress.Overall I felt confident enough to tkae the associated exam, and I passed. Now I am reviewing this package in preparation for the CCIE exams."
4,Why I liked Out of Range,"I downloaded Out of Range while in Jackson, WY at a conference. I try to pick up a regional fiction when I get to a new area of the country. The description of the area, the architecture, and the people there was right on. Reading the story after I was home was like extending my stay in the Jackson area. Out of Range also opened my eyes to the life of a a Game Warden. My husband also read the book and found the story breaks disruptive and thus the whole hard to follow. I didn't have that trouble."
4,A page-turner!,"This is a well-written page-turner, getting you ""inside the head"" of game warden Joe Pickett.A few minor bloopers: Teton County, Wyoming, is ranked #30, not #1, in US county per capita income. Most life insurance policies restrict payments for suicide -- but just for the first two years of the policy. Projectors are often used for PowerPoint presentations, but the projectors aren't called ""PowerPoint projectors,"" and the remote control would control the computer, not the projector. Most remote controls used for PowerPoint presentations don't need to be ""pointed."" It's unlikely a medical examiner would store a loaded gun with evidence, or that an experienced game warden would pick up a gun without checking whether it was loaded."
2,Huh?,"I don't know what book everyone else is reading but the book I read was not Box's best and it was not a tribute to the Joe Pickett we've all come to know and like in 4 previous books. This book is uneven and largely unsatisfying. I finished the book and kept wondering what I had read.There is a subplot going on involving both Joe and Mary Beth flirting with thoughts of affairs...Joe with new character, Stella Ennis, Mary Beth with Nate Romanowski. Neither have the affairs but that they are even a part of the book I found offensive and not true to the characters that Box has created.The best of the book occurs very early and very late in the book. The early involves the death of a rogue grizzley. The very late tells the demise of slimy ex-Sheriff Barnum.If you like Joe Pickett my advice is to skip this book."
4,An excellent review,"The text is slightly slow at times, but for the cultural geographer, anthropologer, or cook, it is incredibly insightful. It is repiticious, but that theme refelcts american foodways."
4,Talented writer will be missed,"I am still absorbing the news that David Foster Wallace apparently took his own life this weekend. He was 46.I vividly recall my experience reading ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,"" because these short short stories are both insightful and laugh out loud funny. Wallace had a keen understanding of the often reptilian and repellent motivations of human beings. He knew that for all our intelligence compared to other animals, we are maddeningly flawed. I would have loved to read his take on recent political news, such as the claim by a presidential candidate that his opponent called his running mate a pig. Wallace's insight will live on."
3,The Unexpected Truth,"A story collection of insecurities written in an authentic voice. A fascinating glimpse into the justifications and rationalizations of confused souls. While exploring some of the pitfalls inherent in the logic of mortals, the author guides the reader into discovering unexpected truths about the human condition. Some stories will have you trembling with laughter, others will force you to re-evaluate romantic ideals, all will entertain you."
4,A unique and highly enjoyable read,"David Foster Wallace has done it again, but in a grander fashion than ever before. The stories contained within ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"" are complex, funny, and at times irritating. Whether or not the latter is DFW's intention is unclear, but true none the less. Some of the stories are paralyzingly involving, while others have you looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the story. Luckily for us, the first kind are far more numerous. The annonymity of the characters in this book are sure to remind you of yourself or people you know, which gives the stories that extra zing of life that some books lack. I reccommend this work to anyone."
4,"Buy the canon lens if you have Canon SLR, otherwise this will do","Good lens. But if you have Canon SLR, buy the canon lens (Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM). There is a difference between the two while used with Canon SLR. Images are sharper with Canon lens, in my opinion.For other SLR camera, I don't see such difference."
1,Don't buy from Amazon,I ordered this item Dec 15 and it will not be delivered until Feb 9. The information above is deceiving about when it will be shipped to you. Just giving you a warning so you don't have to go through as much of a hassle as I have.
4,Awsome Book,"i really liked this book but it was not my favorite. i think my all time favorite was number 6 when amy and ty start dateing. It is kind of hard to ""watch"" them so far away from each other. (in a mental way) when ever amy is at heartland working while ty is in the hospital, the books just don't have the same feel as the others do. but i still really liked the books. i know that i will never stop reading or collecting the books. they are my absoult favorite books in the world. Lauren brooke is one of the best authors i have ever heard of. My english teacher even has noticed a difference in my writing and i owe it all to Lauren Brooke. She has really inspired me and even in away changed my life. oh and by the way, Heartland is a kind of book that you CAN'T put down. it's that good."
5,PLEASE!,I absolutly LOVED this book! I'm not going to give any of the secrets away but i REALLY REALLY REALLY hope that Lauren Brooke will write more books to this series!!!!!!!! I love this series and i never want it to end! PLEASE write more books!
3,Custom Fit?,These wires are stated as being custom fit for 1964 Corvette application under the manifolds. Four wires had to be shortened as they were too long to fit under the top shielding.
5,Extreme Action A Must Buy!,Would recommend this purchase very highly. Great entertainment. Extreme Action has four of the best movies from yesteryear. My family and I watched these movies over and over again and now we have the all on one DVD.
5,SBS Carbon Tech - Best pad for street,"Every Harley I've owned over the last 15 years has had custom mag type wheels on it - hate tubes. Most stock typebrake pads work fine but leave sticky residue on the wheels, rotors and pulley. The SBS Carbon Tech pads leave dustthat is easily wiped off and, additionally, they perform better with less fade and last longer. Just be carefulbreaking them in or you might end up with a squealer."
3,Wake me after dinner,"Georg Phillip Telemann wrote such wonderful, populist music. Such easy, flowing melodies were the mark of genius. But this stuff is just fluff -- background music for dinner, aptly titled ""Musique de Table"". After repeated listenings, I can't find anything important enough to review."
2,"High Maintenance, Loud Machine, Fried timer","While this Krups made some great coffee, I was very unhappy with the extensive clean up required. Bits of soggy coffee grounds end up everywhere. As well, the basket door and other parts of the machine to not dissemble making clean-up difficult (and painful if you don't watch the sharp edges).The grinder is extremely loud. Much louder than any separate grinder that I have used. You could look at it as a built in alarm clock, albeit a very annoying one.Finally, this coffeemaker broke after only five months of use due to humidity getting into the digital timer area. Now I can't stop it from grinding on start-up.All in all, I would not purchase this machine again."
1,not worth the money,I think Krups should perfect the machine before selling it to the public. The coffee is not particully hot it takes forever to brew and is extremely diffecult to clean.I thought it would save a lot of time by having a coffee pot that ground the beans instead it has been more work and time consuming.
1,Not worth the hassle.,"The concept is great, but the grinder clogs constantly, and you don't know it until you go in expecting coffee and have thin brown water. You have to clean and especially dry the grinder area _completely_ after each use or it just flat doesn't work. The coffee isn't very hot, I have to microwave it after I put in a dash of creamer.The grinder was such a hassle I ended up buying a separate grinder and am just using the brew feature until I replace it. Total waste of money.Oh, and putting the grinder on timer in the morning will give you a heart attack when it fires up."
3,"Nice price, for reasons I found out....","As with all products, there are good things about this coffee maker, and there are bad things. We'll start with the bad things: 1. NOISY grinder 2. The Stop & Serve mechanism doesn't work very well 3. The amount of water that you put into the machine is about one or two cups MORE than what comes out as coffee (this is because of the steam cleaning system, which works well, by the way) 4. When you open the top up to clean it, beware of water running everywhere! Good things: 1. Makes GOOD coffee 2. Relatively easy to clean 3. Looks pretty slick on the counter 4. Very easy to use controls, and the manual wasn't written on a college reading levelAll in all, this is a pretty good product, if you're looking for good coffee at a good price. However, if you have an apartment, be sure to buy pre-ground coffee."
4,Good value for the price.,"Considering the average cover price seen on Amazon for this book, it does it's job quite well.As mentioned above there are plenty of how to steps in here for new artists. For someone with their own style and what not it is not nearly as good. However it still will offer most people some good help when it comes to drawing figures like these girls."
5,Thanks Dr. Posnak,"Thanks for transcribing and performing these pieces. My father was a fan of Fat's (in the 1930's) and I have always enjoyed good piano music. In most cases you played these with enough rhythm to disguise your impeccable training. Your rendition of ""Smashing Thirds"" was outstanding. You should have let it go on ""Valentine Stomp"" and ""Keys"". Your CD along with the originals on the CD ""Turn on the Heat"" show that good music isn't confined to that from long dead Germans. If you're in New Orleans look up John Royen, he's good."
5,Great bicycle rack!!!,"We have tried several bike racks over the years with limited success. A hitch mounted one and another that attached over the rear spare tire on a SUV. Both of these racks were made by ""Bell"" and were junk. This 4 bike ""Allen"" rack is sturdy and well built. It sets up quickly and I like the two extra side-straps instead of 4 mounts (two top and two bottom) that most trunk mount racks have. On the down side, its hard to get 4 bikes onto the rack but we have had success with 3 adult sized bicycles. Maybe with a mix of adult and kids bikes would fit four. We have used the rack for the past 3 weeks everyday after work. In fact it has not come off the car nor have the bikes except when we are riding them. The rack stays in place with bumps on the road and taking corners and turns. Nice piece of mind when you are hauling costly bicycles. The rubber saddles strap the bikes securely and don't scratch the bike frames. We are very happy with this quality bicycle rack."
5,Great Product,Fits my 2000 Ford Expedition and my wife's 2002 Ford Focus! Can you get more bang for your buck?
1,"""Wave On Wave"" is too similar to ""In The Living Years""","I agree that ""Wave On Wave"" is too similar to Mike And The Mechanics' ""In The Living Years"".Anyone else think so? there is a poll on pat greens bulletin board."
2,more food,Should have had more useful products listed.Was going to give it to lady at nursing home who had a stroke and can not talk but it does not have enough food items to help her much.
2,not worth it,"Was unable to deter any pest, be it dog, cat, squirrel, skunk, or bird when on animal repellant setting. Strobe light seems to work properly and acceptable, but the alarm seems to be either defective or falsely advertised since when triggered the pulsating noise seems weak and minute (on intruder setting). Proximity that is needed to active the alarm is far smaller than advertised, product description states 30 feet, but its more like 5ft. Overall this product loses three stars for not being able to control outdoor pests, but keeps two stars for at least being able to make some noise."
2,Poor Sensitivity,Sensitivity range is less than advertised. Only alarms when directly in front of unit and within 4-5 feet.
3,Minolta AF not Canon EF lens,"Sorry to said that its not what i've ordered ,as per descriptionMinolta AF what i've got Canon EF 28-200 lens.Very dissapointed. Anyway do you have any adapter EF to Sony Alpha a33."
3,"Good entry watch, but doesn't last","So I'm reviewing a product that was supposed to last 10 years, but lasted three. Initially, the watch from the factory wasn't produced real well...it broke within a few months. However, Invicta has a pretty good repair program. Only problem is that it costs $30 to repair it. That's $30 for a $35 watch. Well, I did it...sent it off to Florida, and it came back in great shape. I've been using it pretty much every day since then. The watch says it's water resistent to 50 meters. Well, I wore it all day at a water park, and got water inside. Just thought I'd let it air dry over the next few weeks, but the water never really left the inner workings, and now the watch is dead. The battery isn't dead, but the watch itself is. So...I guess I'll be looking for a new watch. I don't want to spend another $30 to send it back to be repaired again. Overall, I like the solid feel of this watch. It just hasn't lasted."
2,Its very Good Watch bit it loiks like bigger then it in real so enjoy,Its very Good Watch bit it looks like bigger then it in real so enjoy
2,Alarm set stem separated from watch,"[Timex Men's T47902 Expedition Easy Set Alarm Brown Leather Strap Watch, purchased thru Amazon]This watch was working fine - The first shortcoming was that it would not do enough ""over one hour"" settings for my schedule (I got around that by re-setting when necessary). My major problem is that the alarm set stem detached entirely from the watch while I was trying to do a ""set"" job for the day. So far, have not found a way to make it acceptable to the watch any longer. Ergo - Another ""Doesn't work any more"" watch in my desk drawer - (Yawn). Disappointedly, Ol' T..Timex Men's T47902 Expedition Easy Set Alarm Brown Leather Strap Watch"
2,Watch has water in it,"I like this watch because it is fairly thin, however I have never been able to set the alarm, and now it has moisture in it after 18 months. The watch has never been deeper than 10 feet. The strap lasted about 9 months, but that is to be expected. The warranty is only 12 months, so I will wait for it to stop and find a better watch."
5,Last Watch He'll Ever Need,"Highly recommend this watch, my husband loves it! He digs the alarm feature. It looks nice and is very functional. Would be a great gift!"
3,Great Watch but hard to fix,The Expedition is a great watch and is easy to use and read. The only problem is when you have to replace the watchband. It seems Timex has made this so unique that the watchband replacement costs as much as the watch. So consider this watch disposable when you watchband breaks or wears out as few carry the replacement watchband. Those that do want as much for the watchband after shipping as buying a new watch. So if you are looking for this watch to last make sure you are not hard on your watchband (i.e. don't get it wet or be overly exposed to your perspiration despite that is is suppose to be a sports watch.
1,Rio800 - Digital Thievery,I bought a Rio 800 in February and have used it seldom because it is junk. It has never worked well and the manufacturer couldn't care less. It discharges randomly then charges partially and at its best can't be used for more than an hour. The display is even more frustrating since it is impossible to see - it's sort of grey on blue and navigation is a trial. Please don't subject yourself to unwanted pain. Buy a different product.
1,"Purchased 2, took back 2","Run away from Rio. I purchased 2 units, the first ran for a week, the second for about 1 hour before malfunctioning. Their customer support line is always buzy, tech support is always busy and they don't return e-mail requests for support....I would highly recommend another option. If you are purchasing a player to listen to [audio download] books, the Audible Otis is a great player, not only for books, but also music. It is also considerably less than most Mp3 Players. Additional memory also works quite well, allowing you to get about 2 unabridged books on the unit."
1,Worked great for 2 months,"The Rio was easy to load and easy to use. After 2 months the fast forward button no longer worked which severly limited the ease of use. During the third month the play button stopped working turning it to garbage. I have not been able to find a number to talk to a company representative about my problem but have been able to email the company but still have a light weight, stylish and useless Rio."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I seriously wish I could give it zero stars but I am not allowed to. This will be the very last time I will ever buy a Rio product. I currently have two Rio 800's that aren't functioning at all and both are about 2 weeks old. One of my Rio's doesn't even power up after charging and the other one now plays static instead of the music I put on it. It was actually working fine but when I removed the backpack to register the serial number and reattached it, it no longer plays music!!! The support line makes you wait for a long time and you will be eventually connected to some surfer dude impersonating a technical support rep. Don't be swayed by the cheap price for this hunk of junk. Spend a little more and get something that you know will work. The unit also appears cheap and flimsy. In my opinion the Rio 800 is nothing more than a paper weight."
1,Rio 800 128MB - Big Quality Problem,"SONICblue must have a big, big quality problem. I purchased the unit for my daughter and not able to get it up and running. The rechargeable battery won't hold a charge (or the charger is defective). I was impressed with the relatively large memory and sharp looks but without electricity.... I hope they get this figured out fast and take care of their customers."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this product, the power kept going on and then off. Finally frustrated I returned it. I had the original Diamond Rio 500 so I figured this would be as good, but it was not. Returning something that does not work is never fun."
4,way better than one star,"i usually dont write a review unless an album really impresses me, but in this case, i just want to defend P.A. against those who ""vomit"" over this album. that is not the case with me. in fact, i really enjoy most of this album. i don't like most of the music from down south (no limit & cash money), but i have a weekness for ATL rappers. outkast is the best by far, but i also love youngbloodz, jim crow, and goodie mob. P.A. fits right in here, and this album is a must have for anyone who likes those listed above. tracks 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, and 15 are all great songs and make this album worth picking up. its not one of the years best albums, but it is definately an album i don't regret buying. give it a shot."
2,Lots of errors...,"Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. I love Vol.1 of this series, but this one is full of errors. There are several errors in the tutorial descriptions, which make the step by step instructions for max beginners a pain. Of course if you have some more experience with max, you will spot these errors easily. The worst thing of this book is the CD. There are a lot of projects with wrong links to bitmaps. For most of the projects you can recreate the missing links, because the bitmaps are somewhere on the CD (or your harddisk). But there are also tutorials on the CD (e.g. the fender of the car) which you can't execute because of missing bitmaps. This book is not worth the money you have to pay....of course just my 2 cents."
2,too few techicues for modeling.,"I liked the book overally, but it doesn't include enough technicues for modeling and too much of the book is on materials, anybody can make good looking materials, but the modeling is different. Because the name is advanced modeling and materials, it should have little more about modeling than it has!"
4,Big Beautiful Doll,I like Anna Nicole Smith because she was from Texas and Ilike her because she was very Beautiful and Luscious. May She forever Rest In Peace!
3,Interesting - kinda freaky..,"I picked up this book at a half - price bookstore because it looked interesting. It's about two girls - Delia & Amandine - who form a friendship which soon turns down the wrong path. It was an OK book, not something I would read again, though. At the beginning it was interesting, but as I got deeper into the book, I got bored with Amandine's character and put it down. I ended up skipping to the end - just to see what happens and get it over with. It kind of disturbed me too, the way the author potrayed this girl - really evil. Amandine is supposed to be that way, but it just bothered me. I guess I would recommend this book - as long as you don't expect it to be superly outstanding. A good one-day, rainy-day read."
1,Average at Best,"This Coffee maker has been a huge disappointment. Coffee is average , but it has a propensity to clog somehow, not dispensing the coffee. All things check out. Almost as big a disappointment is the service from Krups. Asked repeatedly, only to receive standard canned response.Also, bought Krups Iron - big disappointment.Buy Braun Coffe maker and Rowenta Iron!"
3,Remote?,The product was fine - I bought it as a gift. Was surprised to discover there was no remote in the box...I don't recall seeing in the description that a remote was not included. That would have been helpful.
1,DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THE PRICE!,"Warner Archives Shop sells every one of their Warner Archive DVDs listed by Amazon sellers for $19.99 or $9.99 specials when buying 5 or more such as THE GARY COOPER 6 DVD COLLECTION from which this comes. You can also download the films for $14.99. As customers, you should be aware of this fact. Warner sells to anyone and even gives quantity discounts and free shipping on orders of $60.00 or more."
4,nut driver set,"Exactly what we needed to perform maintenance on business aircraft. This tool has saved us a ton of time and wear and tear with customer wait times. It allows us quick access among relay boxes, circuit boards without removing the whole unit where additional damage could be at risk - Thanks"
1,misleading,"This is just another book about the holocaust and hungarian jews, and not one of the good ones.The title and back cover has little to do with the book itself, The few American POWs stories are there only to justify the title of the book. It's a shame to use our soldiers in order to sell a book that otherwise would end up in the clearence section not long after printed"
3,Bizzare but rather entertaining,"I'm glad I saw the film before reading the reviews published here because part of the enjoyment of the film is not knowing what is going to happen next. The plot is unique and the acting is good.One of the problems I had with the film was with the superfluous obscenities, lewd comments and homophobic remarks. It is not the obscene nature of the comments that was off-putting, but rather their inappropriateness given the context they were in. I guess I just don't find that sort of thing inherently amusing.The other bothersome aspect of the play was the inconsistent characterizations. Dr. Lester's character, for instance, changes drastically from the beginning of the movie to the end. We are not talking about character development as a result of life experiences or epiphany, either.Overall it was a film worth watching, however. It certainly took a different perspective and a creative mind to think up this plot."
5,A fascinating study in puppetry,"How much control do we have over our own lives? Scholars and theologians alike constantly debate free will and fate, but their studies concern the will of a greater being. What if all that we are is just a marionette being controlled by another person's deft hands? What if it's the same person whom we've crossed paths with on the street, secretly manipulating your every action, even your words and movements? It's no suprise that the story's plot and the hobby of Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) are so intertwined. Incredible performances by all of the cast, especially Malkovich, purposely remaining the flattest character in the movie. Don't see this one if you're going to get hung over by the fact that a portal exists into a man's head. See it to discover what happens when we start pulling other people's strings, how our lives are affected, and what the intoxicating feeling of control can drive people to do."
3,Not too bad; better than American Beauty,"I watched this film on a whim and was quite suprised. It was so wierd I had to finish watching it the whole way through. I really found it quite entertaining. It is very bizarre and an original piece, much better than that so-called Academy Winner ""American Beauty."" John Malkovich is one of the best actors of the 20th century and his acting is superb. I have a feeling this is one of those films you either love or hate, but try watching it--it's pretty good."
2,So What?,"1999 was a really great year for movies and I didn't get to see all the ones I wanted in the theater. So when this one came out on DVD I bought it from trust in the reviews that it was something great. Unfortunately there wasn't much to be seen. I was completely annoyed with John Cusack's preformance and I was never taken in by any of the story's quirkiness. Some genuinely funny moments aside, I am at a loss of words to explain why this movie was not only on ten best lists, but at the top of them as well. I agree with another reviewer here with the phrase ""different doesn't mean brilliant"". Too often these days leading critics are confusing those two words. While very different, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH was far from brilliant."
5,One to watch several times,"I rented this one, then bought it and the soundtrack.A fantastic exploration of some pretty heavy questions, like:What is gendered embodiment?What is agency?What is identity?Ultimately, the movie even seems to suggest that the mere fact of asking these questions is enough and the answers, if, in fact, ""THE answers"" exist, may not be that important except in a personal sense.Definitely worth the price of admission."
4,Being John Malkovich,"This might be the weirdest movie I've ever seen. BJM is about Craig Schwartz, who is a puppeteer who works on the 7 1/2 floor of a building in New York. One day, he finds a door in his office that lets him be John Makovich for 15 minutes and it ditches him on the New Jersey Turnpike. He lets other people try it for $200 and he begins a little something called ""J.M.INC"". Mr. Malkovich finds out about it and he wants to find out what's going on. Craig explains that it's a ""business"", and that entices him to go into the portal himself......."
2,An Acquired Tastelessness,"So this doesn't appeal to everyone. Has there ever been a modern ego as big as Mr. Malkovich's - or one so little justified? This is a joke - no, I don't mean it's a bad film, I mean the film is one big joke - so if you like this sort of surreal, oh-so-terribly-clever if you're of the yuppy generation and think YOU'RE so terribly clever, exponent of meaningless and purposeless film making, you'll be in heaven. I was not. Inexplicably nominated for direction and screenplay - proving once again there is a great contingent of artless voters in the Academy's roster - however, one does have to doff the hat at two performances, the rightfully Oscar nominated supporting work of Catherine Keener, and the unjustly Oscar-neglected work of Cameron Diaz. They are both quite fine and the only reasons to see this bizarre little film."
3,Why the hype?,"I have to be honest. This movie was a little okay. I usually love movies that are different. But this was bad. Take perfectly good actors like John Cuasack, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich, and put them in this publicity stunt of a movie. I really hated the fact that Catherine Keener gave up... I won't give anything away. There are like, 500 sex scenes, and none of them mean anything except that this movie isn't for kids. If your looking for a complete waste of time of a movie, go see Being John Malkovich."
2,I guess I just don't get it...,"My wife and I anxiously awaited this DVD to come from Amazon, and when it came in we popped it in and sat back to watch it. But when the final credits rolled, we both looked at each other in amazement - ""That's it?"".Don't get me wrong...it has a couple funny lines, but overall this is just a bizarre movie. I guess you either get it or you don't. We didn't."
4,Stunningly original and the first half-hour is priceless,"I think John Cusack said it best when he said, ""This is a screenplay that no one could have written, thinking it would ever be made"". It's that original and off-beat. I'm so glad it was also successful since it may open doors to some other off-the-wall ideas that might not seem commercial enough otherwise. This movie is very well-acted the whole way through and the plot is so fresh, you find yourself wondering how anyone ever thought of it in the first place. Cheers to the brave cast who took all this on and to writer Charlie Kaufmann whose unique vision deserves more recognition. The film lost a bit of steam for me by the end but it's never boring and the first half-hour is as funny and startling as anything I've ever seen."
1,Hugh?,"Sorry, when I watched this movie, I sat there with my mouth open watching in curosity as to when I'd finally be free of this torture. Maybe I just didn't get it. It had promise, but it just didn't deliver. I'm still trying to figure out why so many people are saying it was such a good movie.But hey, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."
1,Confused and contrived,"What a load of old cobblers! This is like watching 6 short films strung together and not one of them has anything to do with another. There is no consistency here. It's just another reason why music video clip directors should not be allowed to make films.Ask anyone why he or she liked this film and the standard answer is ""I thought it was interesting."" 'Interesting' is how you describe bad haircuts when you don't want to offend.Malkovich and Cusack should be ashamed of themselves... oh no, they already did Con Air. That was enough."
4,WATCH IT AND WONDER.......,"A PUPPETEER IN NEED OF WORK ,GETS A JOB IN A OFFICE, TO DISCOVER THAT THERE IS A HIDDEN DOOR,WHICH IS THE PORTAL TO JOHN MALKOVICH BRAIN!A VERY FUNNY, DYNAMIC FILM WITH EXCELLENT ACTING(ESPECIALLY CAMERON DIAZ)WHICH WILL HAVE YOU THINKING ABOUT IT HOURS LATER.YOU WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!"
2,I watch it all the way through but not sure why...,May be creative but I like to think the average veiwer has a little more taste and education than the target of this film. MY recomendation? Don't bother Check out all the used ones for sale... wonder why...
2,they tried to write an interesting scenario...,"BUT could not succeed! the story is interesting but not impressing. This is just like some other dump fantastic movies. The writer tries to be impressive, but he becomes rediculous... OK watch this movie and see..."
2,Definitely on the bizarre side...,"Everyone raved about this movie so I had high expectations. But they were left unmet. There were moments of brilliance in this film and also moments of pure stupidity. The real John Malkovich is a good sport for going along with this one. Save if for a Saturday night, ""let's have few beers"" kind of night. Don't see it straight. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense."
5,Original and Funny.,"I am glad I went to see Being John Malkovich because it was a very fun movie with an original idea and a smart screenplay. I guarantee you enjoy it.The film is totally weird (not a bad thing), it follows the story of Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) who one day, finds a hole that leads to John Malkovich's body and mysterious and weird adventures...I totally recommend Being John Malkovich to viewers everywhere, if you haven't seen it, see it!"
1,Not worth the film that it took to make it!,"Although this ""piece"" might establish some sort of strange ""cult"" following, it was a truly worthless film. While there may have been some bits of humor and sexual references scattered here and there, this was a waste of film - AND - My Money that I spent on the DVD that I can't give away! Do yourself a favor and go for walk on a busy freeway before choosing to watch this movie. To steal a famous quote: ""Two Thumbs Down""! Better luck next time John Malkovich!"
2,I wasn't laughing...,"I'm not going to say this was a BAD movie, it just wasn't a very good one. Somehow the comedy was lost in the wierdness and twisted thinkings of the movie. This movie was just strange. Most unusual is just thinking about the later part of the story, with Malkovich becoming the puppeteer, and how that would fit in real life. While there are some entertaining moments, and some interesting ideas posed, they are lost by the imagery of the darker humor, such as the animal cage part. This is one of those movies that's too silly to be a drama, and too seriously written to be a comedy."
3,With Moore at Corunna,"It should be noted that this book is work of fiction; well written and, for the most part, historically accurate, but fiction. However, the recently printed paper back version offered here gives no indication that this book is a novel, not the biography of a real officer in the British army fighting in the Peninsular war. Neither the word 'fiction' or 'novel' is found in a forward, the preface, on the cover or anywhere else in this reprinted edition."
4,nice for the price,the others who have reviewd this item are right on. the hammer is beutifuly crafted and would make a great decooration. unfortunatly thats not why i bought it. i am a little bit more... active with the hammer. i actualy practice with it. the pins are coming loose and if one was to actualy try to use it to pierce armor the head would surly break off
2,Fantastic photography.,"The photography in this film is fantastic, but that's about all it has to offer. Malick's attempt to philosophize was didn't seem to come off as far as I was concerned, and if he spent twenty years preparing and making this film I feel it was time wasted. I guess the only War movie that's ever going to hit the mark is Saving Private Ryan. However, any aspiring filmmaker shoudl see the Thin Red Line for its photographic conent if for nothing else."
2,Rent this movie before you buy it.,"I know that everyone wants to hear how great a movie is. Well, I can't say The Thin Red Line is a great movie.Maybe my expectations were too high. After all, I bought this movie after watching Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and A Bridge Too Far. So, I was expecting The Thin Red Line to be on that level. With 7 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, a cast that includes many of the top names in Hollywood, and a huge budget, the bar was set pretty high.To me this movie was way too artsy. It just wasn't a ""war"" movie in the same way as Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The all star cast contributed mostly small parts, almost like cameo's. None of the ""stars"" had a huge roll.I would strongly suggest that you rent this movie before you buy it."
1,LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY,You leave the theatre feeling a wiser man. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU AGE THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE!!! It's b-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-r-i-n-g-!
1,"Waisting Time movie,Bad Director","Too many flash back. Slow and sluggish Action. Waisting a lot of time to come out to the point of the story. This is a very Thin Red Line indeed and will never ever get an Academy Award. Big Budget Movie but Poor Quality. You see once, felt asleep and never want to see again."
1,Terrible. Couldn't even finish it.,"After wasting an 1.5 hours of my life watching this drivel, I couldn't take it anymore. If you enjoy countless rambling voiceovers, numerous shots of green grass waving in the wind, a story with no discernable plot, characters that you don't care about (or maybe even hate) then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, stay away."
4,Too long,"This movie is good, but its really slow and I can't get through it without falling asleep multiple times. Ignorant as it sounds, watching this movie is like reading a book."
1,I thought the video would never end...,"I've read several favorable comments on this movie but I must say it is the worst movie I've viewed in a long time. To say it was boring would be an understatement. It seemed like it would never end. The urge to hit the fast-forward was overwhelming. It had no story, poor special effects and jumped around so much it made my head spin. I never connected with any of the characters and still didn't know any of their names by the end of the movie. This movie was compared to Saving Private Ryan ? Ha! The credits in SPR were more exciting than this movie. I'm sorry but I'm giving it ONE star out of pity."
1,True to war,"Although the card carrying mensa-ite and the holier than thou visionaries disagree greatly about the movie, one fact is clear. It has been said that war is 99% boredom and 1% terror. Perhaps the director sought to provide just such a balance. The juxtaposition of poetic musings against this boredom, while interesting, really doesn't make for much of a movie experience. I can do without the 30 minute setpiece of Ryan, but the attempt to have us simultaneously attain the suspension of disbelief AND care about ANY of the characters fails on both counts. But that doesn't mean that I'm a bad (or stupid, or insensitive) person!J. Hunter"
5,My favorite war film,The all so subtle style and beauty of Malick's approch to filmaking is inspiring. I must have seen this film over 100 times and still enjoy it just as much.Once I get a Blu-Ray player I will get the extended blu ray edition. Cant wait!
1,Horrible,"Horrible movie. Among my top five worst, along with The Crying Game and Talented Mr. Ripley."
1,Snorefest,"I loaded this into my DVD expecting a fine film based on my all-time favourite book and I was disappointed... 10 minutes into the movie. A quarter of the way through I fell asleep and woke up. Thinking I had missed something good, I went back and watched what I missed. Boring. I fell asleep again. About 2 hours into the movie I got so sick of this that I just stopped watching it. It was sooooooooo boring. Sure, it's an OK movie - if you haven't read the book. It's unrelated to it in almost every aspect. This was just garbage. Saving Private Ryan is 100000 times better than this. Then, ANY war movie is 100000 times better than this. See the original The Thin Red Line in black and white. It is so much better.A fine film full of potential - ruined. Sigh..."
5,"Warning, This Film is not Saving Private Ryan!","This film is nothing like Saving Private Ryan, which is an exceptional film in its own right, but makes attempts at other things. While Saving Private Ryan is primarily concerned with combat situations and tactics in detail, as well as a fair amount of emotions bonds and personal aspects. The Thin Red Line is primarily concerned with the relationship between man and nature. The opening scene says it all, with Witt in an untouched paradise, unencumbered by the haunts of war. Absolutely brilliant performances all around, particularly by Nick Nolte. The personal side, the absolute true emotions sparked by war are portrayed in this film. I am not saying this film is better than Saving Private Ryan, because SPR is just as good at what it attempts to do. I just think that TTRL is being unfairly criticized because of the comparisons to SPR. TTRL can be fully appreciated upon multiple viewings."
2,Not even close to Saving Private Ryan!,"I am a WWII vet, 1st all-filipino infantry regiment, U.S Army, trained at Fort Ord, Monterey Ca. 1942. Although I was not in the European Theater, I fought in the Pacific, Thin Red Line does not come close to Saving Private Ryan in any aspect of war. Losing many friends on the field and dealing with war itself is something I cannot describe. Watching Private Ryan is as close as you can get to REAL combat. The thin red line is a good movie that takes war in a different perspective, but please do not compare it to a great movie like Saving Private Ryan."
5,Why see explosions and gore.,"The first time I went to see it, I was comparing it to ""Private Ryan"". There lied my biggest fault. ""Line"" is a much deeper film, was a better messege about life (and death). It was very unconventional and that is what made it great. It didn't have to appeal to a large audience."
1,ALTERNATE TITLE: THE ZERO SENSE,"I tried to watch this movie a couple of times. The one battle scene where an enemy camp is overrun is good, but the rest of the movie makes no SENSE!"
1,WASTE OF TIME,"JK REED IS DEFINITELY WRONG ON THIS ONE. THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, AS WELL AS A WASTE OF TALENT. MOST OF THE PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TO WHO'VE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED WAR TELL ME THAT THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE. CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF, THIS MOVIE HAS NO ARTISTIC MERIT WHATSOEVER."
2,"This gets two, instead of 1, ONLY because I'm a WWII buff","When I sat down to watch this film I thought I was really about to see something great. As it turned out, however, I sat through a 3 hour talk-a-thon. I can respect the opinions of those that think it was a smart cinematic move to listen to the soldier's stories, but I can only handle it in moderation. I don't really care if some private's wife leaves him for an Air Force pilot...I really don't. There were so many thought-reading segments I thought I was going to puke. Compare the beginning of TRL to Private Ryan. In one, a couple of AWOLers are caught mingling with Aborigines - wow, exciting. In the other, assault troops are getting shredded to pieces on the Normandy beaches. Not that I'm some neo-Nazi who enjoys watching Americans get killed, but at least it didn't put me to sleep. Well, feel free to rant and rave all you want, but this is my opinion, and it isn't going to change."
3,"Pales by comparison to ""Saving Private Ryan"".","This DVD pales by comparison to ""Saving Private Ryan"". It tries to philosophize too much -- as if it were giving second graders morality lessons. Because of this, it was painfully slow to view. The transfer is good, but not great."
4,Warning!,"Ok first of all this is a warning about the blu-ray not the movie -which is such an excellent movie by the way. My problem-my fault I admit it- is that the movie is only in English. Yes I know is in English but What I didn't anticipate was that It didn't have any other language, not even as subtitle! None! So finally I ended watching the movie all by myself because the rest of the family is far from being fluent in English.OK I know I should have checked first but How could I have imagined that in these days of globalization I was going to buy the only movie with only one language.Of course the joke is on me (lol)."
2,Is It Done Yet?,"Sorry - I grant everyone scads of talent all around: it takes EXCEPTIONAL talent to turn such naturally exciting and interesting material into such a soporific wet noodle. But this movie is a huge snooze. First comes storytelling and THEN you can get artsy all over the place, OK? There are better war films... but not a huge number of worse ones. This is one of those DVD's where you keep checking the ""time remaining"" to see how much longer this can go on. Trust me, it'll seem longer than the clock indicates."
2,HORRIBLE FILM!,"""The Thin Red Line"" fails at everything except battle scenes, the only reason I gave it a second star! There were too many stories, and the stories were acted and directed like a horrible High School play! A boring piece of cinema! Skip this garboage, and watch superb war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Gods and Generals!"" Grade: D-"
2,Doomed to fail,"Many people have already compared this to Saving Private Ryan, so I won't bother with that. What I think is a more interesting comparison is the film of TTRL vs. the novel. To put it succinctly, the novel is amazing. I think everyone should know by now that when you try to transform an amazing novel into a movie it will always be lacking. As others have stated, they should have given this movie a different title, because it is not, and could never hope to be, The Thin Red Line."
1,extremly boring,This movie drags on and on and on half the time displaying only scenery shots grass blowing in the wind for 10 minutes while the actor talks about his philosphy in a monotone voice out of all the battles in ww2 they picked the wrost one to make a movie about I can recall only a 30 min. of action through out the whole what? 3 hour long movie I fell asleep in the theater for awhile only after 30 min. of the movie a total disapointment this is nothing compared to Saving Private Ryan.
1,Awful Awful Awful,This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it.
2,one of the worst war films ever,This movie was a mess. The director was trying to copy other great movies and ended up with a brokenplot that lurched from scene to scene. Very boring. I cant believe all the big name actors and most ofthe time it seemed like a bunch of kids playing army in their back yard. Spend millions turning a $10 scriptinto a movie and you end up with this crap.
1,Terrible...,"I'm a fan of good WWII movies and this is the worst one I've seen yet. It's like what you'd get if you had someone who's anti-war and who's directed Calvin Klein ads for 20 years make a war movie.For the first twenty minutes I thought it was a movie about Vietnam! It doesn't look like WWII at all. The voiceovers were meant to sound deep but came across as funny instead. Terrence's obsessions with nature and symbolism are quite evident. At nearly three hours, it's two hours too long if you ask me.If I could give it 0 stars I would."
1,The big red snoozer!,"This movie is very long, very slow moving, very boring! It seems like the producer was more worried about making his point about how bad war is than making a good movie. The Japanese soldiers surrender at the first hint of danger (I THINK NOT)!Another bother about the film is that there are so many big stars with such tiny roles (such as George Clooney-he has a whole two minute scene in this three hour film!). They were probably just thrown in to help it sell. It was a real chore for me to finish the entire movie (I fell asleep TWICE). Buyer beware."
5,A masterpiece - Not just a war movie,"The Thin Red Line, in my opinion, is a masterpiece, an atmospheric and poetic war drama, possibly one of the best movies of the 90's. Some compare it to Saving Private Ryan, but I think this is inappropriate, as they are very different movies. Saving Private Ryan is a war movie, and a great one at that...However, the Thin Red Line is a deeper movie, at times emotional and spiritual, showing the horor of war. It's a long movie, and at times seems slow, but the great visuals, backgrounds, and photography more then make up for any of it's shortcomings. The end is very good, and sad. See this movie!"
4,A nice adaptation of the novel to the screen.,"A very haunting and moving movie told by Terrence Malick. Whereas ""Private Ryan"" was realistic, ""Line"" went more into the characters. Even though we do not know what happens to the characters afterwards, we know what they are feeling and thinking before, during, and after the battles. From the wait on the ships, to the landing, and then finally onto the battle, we see glimpes of each of the characters. The cinematography by John Toll is mezmerizing and beautiful, one of the best shot films in many years. Superbly acted by both the new and veteran actors. A very good movie. I highly recommend this movie to all true lovers of cinema."
1,huge waste of time,"this movie does not live up to the book or the original movie. it is a stupid waste of time and the plot is, well, i don't know what it is. it's wasn't even worth the effort put into the mouse clicks to get here. so many actors were wasted and this was made to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success it seems. even my grandpa who was in the pacific in WW2 thought it was a dumb movie. i only reccomend this to people who have trouble falling asleep. turn this movie on, and the dialague will have you out like a light...."
1,One of the worst war movies I have ever seen!!!,One of the worst representations of war and its effects on the human psyche. Those of you who have plenty of time on your hands and enjoy discussing existential themes over coffee should by all means sit back and enjoy this movie. The rest of us would be much better served watching truly epic and moving war films such as SPR and Platoon.
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I'm sorry but I thought this film was a sleeping pill in the form of a movie. I fell alseep for real! Or maybe it's too deep for me or something. Oh and one more thing, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
3,"Great Story, Great Photography, Stupid Director","They could have cut out an hour from this film without missing a thing. The first and last parts were wisps of a bad director's imagination. The battle scenes were realistic, but the prelude on the balmy island was senseless and the constant flashbacks were irritating. After all, it was a film about war! Save the sermonizing for the next romantic comedy."
5,WOW!!!,"This movie is nothing less than astonishing....not only is it mentally stimulating, but visually brethtaking as well. Never has such minimal blood and guts been so effective in showing the horrific depths of war....my only advice is to see it with an open mind (not one brainwashed with generic movies like Saving Private Ryan) and see it when you have the patience to, not just to see a movie...it can be metally exhausting."
1,I've seen better films on public television,"This film could put a chain smoker to sleep during an earthquake. It's so boring you won't believe it. The combat doesnt look real either. The actors portraying Japanese soldiers act like a bunch of twelve year olds who have never seen a gun go off before. They throw their hands up at the first sign of an American soldier without putting up a fight (yeah right!). In addition to all that, the history is all messed up. The US soldiers are portrayed as attackers when in fact they dug in and defended the island from the Japanese. What a joke."
1,Weak and Inaccurate,"This movie is slow, boring, and if our soldiers truly behaved as portrayed, the end should involve Hitler and Japan winning WWII.Hey, all you coffee house liberals that love this movie, pretending that our fathers who fought in WWII act like you do when you fight with your 90's girlfriends...it's called PROJECTION.If it weren't for them, you wouldn't have anywhere to whine...."
1,HATED IT....,The Cast gives me every reason to like this movie.... But the people they play do not... there isn't really anyone to like in this movie - nobody to cheer for. And the long drawn out dream scenes get to be very boring... Don't waster your time buying it... If you must see it - rent it first... It will save you money in the long run....
2,Very poor war flick,"If we assume that this was a war flick, it was a pretty bad one. The combat scenes are unrealistic and the protagonists are wooden and unconvincing. If it had really been like this, the US would have lost the war.The worst thing about the movie is that it was boring. The second worst thing is that the acting was poor. The third worst thing is that the story was a bore. The fourth worst thing is that this was not really a war flick at all.The only reason I gave this one two stars instead of one is that I was able to watch it to completion. Mind, I had to try multiple times, but I finally did finish it. I guess because I'd already wasted my money. But the movie was a bore.Pass this one by. It does not deserve to live."
1,Terrible War Movie,"This movie had no plot, no character developement, and barely any action. In Saving Private Ryan(I gave 5 stars) you are taken from one place to another knowing exactly what is going on. In The Thin Red Line nothing makes sense. You are taken from one scene to another without much explanation of what is going on. The acting was nothing special in this movie either. Half of the actors in the top credits barely have a 5 minute part. I wrote this because of a review I read about Saving Private Ryan. Some guy gave it one star and said that this movie was brilliant. I guess you have to decide for yourself."
2,thin red ass,its easy to see why people dont like this film. It aint ya average war flick sure the battle scenes were far more realistic than windtalkers but at least in windtalkers there was never a boring moment. The film is basicaly 3hrs of spiritual crap its a war film nobody gives a sh*t about peace and spiritual hoha. Half the main characters pass by and you never really notice them and big stars like george clooney and john travolta have only a handful of lines. Pass film by and save your money.
4,Good War film,"I liked it. Plenty of action, not overblown, acting was above average, seemed believable."
2,I wasted 3 hours of my life,"First off, the cinematography was excellent and the cast was unsurpassed. Aside from several great sequences in the film (not all of them where action sequences), the film dragged its feet. There was at most 2 hours of redeemable film stretched out to 3 hours. Malick has a vision in this film, almost ""Apocalypse Now"" like vision, showing the motivation behind each character. That part is not the problem, telling the emotional and mental pain soldiers go through while at war is a wonderful goal. Unfortunatly that goal is not met in this film. One of the problems is Malick tried to do this with too many characters. At times, I had no idea which charatcer was narrarating. The short scene with John Cusack is the most exhilarating scene in this film and the best one I've seen in quite awhile. Overall its a good film if you want to study human behavior in time of war, but not if you want a war film. It's not about war, it's about soldier's reaction to war."
2,Too much of a good thing.,"The movie was beautifully filmed, the actors were well-known, and the writing was superb. The only problem is that soldiers did not comb and spray their hair before an excursion, the average day did not have a spectacular sunset, and war is not poetic. I really wanted to like this movie, but the many loose ends within just were not tied together. When too many variables of a movie are made to be perfect, some aspects of reality are lost. I watched this movie and just had a terribly hard time believing it. Play this movie for a war veteran and most, I think, would tell you they had little time to ponder the questions of life presented within it. This movie is like too much sugar in a cake... It makes it too hard to swallow."
1,Wish I could give it no stars.,"I love war movies, particularly, WWII movies. And let me just say, this is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in any genre. It's been several years since I watched this movie and I still regret the time in my life I spent in the theater watching this film. I could have spent the time doing anything else. I could have gotten a root canal in half the time and it would have been less painful. The director, not so delicately, drives home his politics beginning to end. With that all said... if you want to watch a political-hack piece of extreme anti-war rhetoric then this is definitely the film for you."
5,Captain Sulu at his best!,"I loved how Captain Sulu performed in ""The Undiscovered Country"" and now this book carries on with this very intense and believable incarnation of former Lieutenant Sulu from the Original Series. Great! And even though I grew up with the Original Series Star Trek, I also came to love TNG as well and, later, VOYAGER and ENTERPRISE. Being an avid fan of sci-fi in general, however, it would be an injustice on my part not to mention the many other old and new sci-fi works that both led me to Star Trek and which have forever forged my love for all sci-fi works: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""Foundation"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Ringworld"", all the ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" books, as well as books as new to the genre as ""Advent of the Corps"" and others."
5,Great CD and DVD,Bourght as a gift for my husband. He loves it. CD is great and was surprised that there was a DVD. Sound quality is great.
5,Martin Guitars,"Wonderful book! If your into Martin's, this is a great read. This one's better than Walter Carter's book..."
2,Heard it all before,"Five years later and it's...Elastica II. This isn't much different from their first one, and that one wasn't anything to get excited about. The fact that album had four songs that ripped off very recognizable songs dind't help.Well, after listening, I really can't pick any obvious rips, but that doesn't mean this is a good album. It's really the same album as the first one. Just because it sounds a wee bit differently doesn't mean anything. It took 5 flippin' years for them to make this! It should be brillant, but it's just crap.If you want a good album, and want to know who Elastica has been ripping off wholesale, go out and buy Wire's 154 or Chairs Missing, especially 154. Also, maybe Parallel Lines by Blondie would be a good idea as well."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I've had this album since june because i paid import dollars for it. This is FAR from their classic self titled debut, and although it seems like Rolling Stone and Amazon seem reluctant to pick this album apart, it wouldn't be too hard to do. There are some strong points, most notably 'image change', 'da da da', and the first 2 or 3 tracks, but for those who loved the ""hit-and-run"" ""rapid-fire"" SMART trashiness of the first cd, forget it. This album just can't manage to put a string of songs together the way 'Elastica' did. i'd recommend this cd simply because it's better than 90% of the stuff out there now."
2,"New Sound for Elastica, Poor Execution","It's been five years since the release of Elastica's debut album, but apparently they didn't spend much of the intervening time writing songs or working in the studio. Most of the tracks sound like amateurish doodling instead of finished songs. There's lots of screaming, discordant guitars and odd time signatures. When the Pixies used these same elements in the late eighties they created awesome masterpieces; in the hands of Justine Frischmann and her bandmates-du-jour we get a bunch of unmemorable tracks that don't hold together. There's also two new keyboard players in the band, but their contributions are uninspired and don't add much to the overall sound.Don't get me wrong; I'm glad Elastica had the guts to try something new. The last thing I'd want to hear is a carbon-copy of their first album. But they should have worked on refining their new sound before committing it to disk."
2,"New Sound, Poor Execution","I made the expensive mistake of buying this CD as an import. It's been several years since Elastica's eponymous debut CD, but they apparently didn't spend much of the intervening time writing and practicing new songs. There's lots of discordant guitars, screeching vocals and odd time signatures. When the Pixies used these same elements a decade ago they created masterpieces. In the hands of Justine Frischmann and her bandmates-du-jour, all we get are a bunch of sloppy tunes which don't hold together. To boot, the two new keyboardists in the band don't add much to the overall sound, except for amateurish doodles here and there.Don't misunderstand me; the last thing I'd want to hear would be a carbon-copy of their first album. I just wish they'd spent more time polishing their new sound before committing it to disk."
5,fantastic,"shipped really fast and was in new shape, as promised. i thought i bought it through amazon but it turned out to be from an indy dealer. very happy.the music is a little quirkier than the first cd, but very catchy. catchy usually is a bad thing, but in this case, I really enjoyed jamming to it while cooking. It got me moving. Also, the vocals are less raspy and mellow, more upbeat and focused in this cd than in the first."
4,Great help for Older Adult,We put this up for our 78 year old mother in our guest bath. It was extremely reliable and helped her a lot. It was easily to install.
1,Dangerous product,"This product is great, except for two faults 1. It is subjuct to loose suction at any time and come off the surface it is stuck to. 2. The bar slides when it is stuck to the wall surface. It is a dangerous product. I am convinced it gets lots or reviews from shills who have a financial stake in the product."
3,Safety First!!!,Works very well in walk-in-shower.every home should have one in each bathroom!!!The wife loves the easy way to install and release.
5,"Secure, easy, durable","A recent family injutry required some added security stepping into our shower. We purchased the long and short version of these. Fantastic. Once came loose after being up for 1 day, was placed back tight and has held firm since. Large suction cups and secure grips make this item safe and secure."
3,Hand Grip,"The process was so easy and fast. It was delivered in a couple of days. It works geat but if you have tiles and they are not large enought, the device will be over a grout line and will not adhere. You must have a completely flat surface."
2,"Won't fit 4"" square tile wall.","I ordered this along with the 17"" one to use in my shower. This will not work on a tile wall of 4"" tile. The spacing of the tile will not allow the suction cups to fully cover a tile, so the grout lines keep it from making suction. Would work well on othe surfaces withou grout lines. The 17"" is just the right length to allow full suction on the tiles."
3,Tunnel Vision,"Tunnel Vision is a sketch comedy film, much like the Groove Tube, or Kentucky Fried Movie. Some of the gags are funny, while some of them are not. I found Tunnel Vision less amusing than either The Groove Tube, or Kentucky Fried Movie, so unless you just love these type of movies I would suggest one of those instead."
1,Tunnel Vision is Dated and Crude,"Poor production values, but that's not the worst. It tries desparately to be funny but it's not very often anyway. This stuff is soooo dated. Perhaps, it was interesting and funny in the 70s, but I got bored watching it. I thought I had seen it at a drive-in years ago, but I realize now that what I really saw was The Groove Tube. Pretty bad when you watch something for nostalgia's sake and it ends up making you depressed. Save your time and money. SNL on even a bad night( which is frequent) is much funnier."
5,You Rock,"The more I listen to these guys the more I want to hear them. ""Straight Up"" has the music everyone will remember for years to come and the newer songs they play live are awesome as well. Lel has a distinct voive unlike any other. Thanks for the book Lel, I've read the first chapter so far and it's already helping me see. Love you guys. P.S.-Timmy, YOU Rock."
4,"Good, But too Christian for Me","Unlike some Christians whose typical phrases are like, ""Jesus will fix you up if you believe in Him,"" this book teaches you ""self reliance."" The content is written with scientific (in this case, psychology) basis, and I find it helpful. Since I am not religious I had a difficulty, but I am sure readers with Christian faith will find this book wonderful.This is an intellectual approach to the content of Bible, and because of it I find it readable even though I am non Christian. I think the author did a great favor to human kind to point out how we have freedom to define our lives."
5,Must Be Nice,"to listen to masters of their craft present a flawless exemplar and consider it merely average.A year ago I didn't know anything about El Gran Combo - yeah, I have a lot of catching up to do - it's great journey and it's gotta start somewhere.This is a great somewhere to start: every note in its place, every beat, not too much, not too little. Perhaps they don't have the ""fire"" they once had back in the day, I don't know. I can collect the older ones as time goes by."
5,Where does the SALSA comes from?,"Excellent production as always from EGC. What really motivated me to write this coment was the following for many years ""salseros"" we arguing about the Salsa Origins. On track # 4 ""Arroz con Habichuelas"" I finally found the answer of my concern. ""La cadencia del son de Cuba elegante y el swing de Nueva york siempre pa'lante"""
3,AVERAGE AT BEST.,"Its one thing to be a fan and another to give it more praise that it deserves.This album is not that big of a deal,yeah El Gran Combo Great Band back in the days...BACK IN THE DAYS their time is almost up they can still cash in with the oldies but just like Sonora Ponsena they shold call it quits while they can still perform dance and enjoy whats left. Ill probably get it from other reviewers but the truth must be told. Yo soy BORICUA but enough is enough they havent had anything SOLID in years.Thank you for the music the momories fellas but they will not get anybetter with any of their albums...unless they get Gilberto Santa Rosa...and thats a long shot..."
2,Not worth it,"As the other reviewers have noted, this isn't one of Playboy's best efforts. The women are marginal. One reason I bought this is because I'm a Shannon Long fan. Her segment though is the same one Playboy has put out a few times already in 21 Playmates, and video calendar."
2,Not what is pictured,"These lamps are beautiful and very well made but they are not what is pictured and so I was very disappointed. I thought I was ordering a cream/tan colored lamp but it arrived and is bluish-green, not at all like the picture. I didn't want a dark lamp; I wanted a light neutral lamp. Now I have to go through the process of returning these."
3,Pretty,"This is a nice little journal with lovely illlustrations, but the quality wasn't that great. I was rather disappointed."
2,A flimsy blank book,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I purchased one of these about 15 years ago. As blank books go, it's poor quality (the pages started coming loose/falling out very quickly). The illustrator was probably not familiar with the LOTR books, as the illustrations are not accurate; they also have an amateurish quality, as if they were drawn by an art student instead of a professional artist. The reason I bought the book at the time was simply because it was one of the larger page formats available; however there are many more blank book options available now than I was able to find at the time."
1,Journal or Book?,"I am still waiting 3 months for my item. Just got an e-mail that it is unavailable and I won't be receiving it. Yet, it is still on the website as available. What's up?!"
3,The Love War,"omg finally the featured item is a item i own!!Anyway, this tape focues on uranus,neptune, lita, and melvin and molly's relationship.it isnt one of my personal favorites...But honestly, this tape is lighthearted and funny, sailor moon fans will surely enjoy it."
4,Great book,"what a thriller! and the best part is, it's a true story. very interesting book that will keep you flipping pages."
3,"Not a ""bad"" effort","SO this CD is decent, I like the music alot more than I like the singer who is trying way to hard to be Chino from Deftones. This band is very similar to the Deftones, so if you like the deftones as I do you will find this tolerable, they arent breaking any new ground just adding to the pool of music. Check it out, but for a better time check out Dredg or Soil."
4,"Hi! We're Relative Ash, You Don't Know Us Yet...But you Will","I got this cd about two weeks ago and thought it was pretty good. They sound like the Chino from the Deftones meets 40 Below Summer's music. The lyrics, while graphic, are very well written and not just easy catch phrases for drunken masses to sing along to. The music stays heavy but never seems to repeat itself. My personal favorites are definately ""Pout"" and ""Hymen"". Don't be fooled by the titles of the songs, the music is complex and not like a Drowning Pool or Saliva. The only fault in the cd is that I wish the lead singer would sing for longer stretches of time. As is, most songs consist of him either him screaming or at a near whisper. But overall, this beats so much of the ""nu metal"" thats out right now,..."
1,The worst of the bad,"How can someone who has ever learned to write, produce such a stupid paperfilling. If you enyoy reading, pass this bunch of nonsense, else you maybe never touch one book again. How can a sensible person ever think about a Nobel nomination for this cheese advertising fool."
4,Great pan!,"I use this pan a lot ever since I got it! I love it! It's a little heavy, but nothing sticks! The price wasn't bad either."
3,"Pretty, but not very detailed","This map is nice because it is colorful, laminated and easy to handle, but many smaller roads are left out."
3,Geeks From the Inside,"This novel is great if you want an idea of the frustration of Silicon Valley startups.The geeks are maybe a little too eccentric to be real, but are amusing.They don't quite have the depth that Neil Stephenson's characters do in Cryptonomicon, but the plot is interesting and fast enough to keep me reading.The technology was right up to date as off 1997, though a bit dated now. It was still used well enough to do justice to the authors knowledge. Not technical in anyway, and could be read by someone with no knowledge of IT.Not a challenging read, but very entertaining."
3,"Wryly Humorous, but about as Deep as a Parking Lot Puddle","""The 1st $20M is the Hardest"" is breezy, hip, and about as deep as a parking lot puddle.Andy leaves the big tech company to go write some code in a sort of 90's Spirit Walk. Along the way this bright, naive, young idealist is manipulated into starting a company. The story ambles along through the ""Andy in Wonderland"" atmosphere of the Silicon Valley startup.Bronson's prose is hip and cynical. Some of his vignette's are precious.However, the story was a bit thin. The plot reminded me more of a juvenile novel than the polished work of an accomplished author. Sections of the novel are quite good, but the matrix is too weak to hold it all together. The story falls apart into a collection of amusing anecdotes.I started ""The 1st $20M is the Hardest"" based on an excerpt published in ""Wired"". It should have stayed a short story or a novella. Bronson's wry humor helped me to finish this book, but there is not enough substance to recommend it."
2,"Stiff, shallow characters. Story falls apart in 2nd half","This book was a big disappointment. While the premise is interesting & compelling, being in Silicon Valley, this book was a not very engaging, and the characters were undeveloped and wooden"
5,foreign gem,I was totally engrossed by this movie from beginning to end. Time flew by with no distractions.This is the reason I buy foreign films sight unseen. You can discover gems like this. Silvia Abascal and Eduardo Noriega played beleviable and lovable characters that encounter many twists and turns in this engrossing thriller. It really has a gut-wrenching ending.I just wish there was more to the DVD besides the movie and chapters. Oh well thats why we have the internet. I loved this movie.
5,I can go to the rock,...I do think that this album is a very good album. I like the song order my steps the best because it gave me a very good message on what God wants me to do for him and how I can help myself with my spirtal growth. Thank you very much
2,Worthless book,"I have found the book quite wealthy in its contents but the accompanying CD was a complete failure... most of the more ""complex"" examples had to be fixed in order to be readable by IE4.01 or NS4.05. I liked the editing but the author gave topics like JavaScript, and gave only several basic concepts of the scrippting language although there was code in which he used JavaScript code which couldn't be understood without additional resources. But practically it's a good reference for beginners or those who only want to know the basics. I would personally suggest, in order really to get somewhere go for ""HTML 4.0 unleashed Professional reference edition""."
5,A must have for Deborah Harry and Blondie fans,"Cathay Che wrote this biography from a series of interviews with Deborah Harry. It was first published in the UK as ""Platinum Blonde"". It provides insights into the life of Deborah Harry, the history of Blondie, and more information than in other biographies or band books. But, I am biased: I contributed to writing the book. When Cathay Che wanted a complete discography, she inquired and was referred to me, as I have the most complete collection of Deborah Harry/Blondie recordings in the US."
2,Average lens for an average price...,"Let me start by saying that the lens looks very nice. It's build quality seems ok. The zoom ring has a little play to it when zoomed out and there is a little play when attached to my Canon 20D. The lens is not very sharp at f/4 or 2.8, but you can get by with sharpening in photoshop. I also bought a Sigma 1.4x comverter and I have to shoot at f/8 to get a sharp image. The focus is very quiet but is not that fast. It searches a lot and seems to focus just behind fast moving subjects. I switched over from Nikon and I didn't have a ton of money to buy all of the Canon EF lenses. If you have the extra money buy the Canon EF 70-200 f/2.8. I'm sure it's focus is right on and is tack sharp. But if you're on a budget like me you'll have to settle for the Sigma. You always get what you pay for and I feel that I should shelled out the extra money for the Canon. I hope this will save a few people the mistake that I made."
2,not what I hoped for,"I bought this hoping for a book that included all or at least most of the characters featured in the many Star Wars books, movies and games. I was very disappointed. This book only features a hand full of characters from the New Republic. Save your money."
3,a good book but missing essential characters,"This book was very good except that it was missing some good characters. The characters that where missing (or crammed in a tiny appendix) are Tenel Ka, Lowbacca, Zekk, The Dark Women, Rayner Thul, Tionne, Nomi Sunrider, Siri Tachi, Xanatos and Tahari. The Jedi council (besides Master Windu & Yoda ) are barely mentoined, I wish that Adi Gallia, Ki-Adi-Mundi (especially), Plo Koon, Even Piell, Saesee Tiin, Eeth Koth, Depa Billaba and Yaddle would be given at least a page each. Also there are many boring people like Ric Olie, Panaka, the Lars, Nute Gunray, and Watto should get less pages. Their are also people that should get more then one page such is Count Dooku (especcially), Exar Kun, Ulic Qel-Droma and Sedriss. But overall it is a fun read. The Solos, the Skywalkers, Chewwie, Obi-Kenobi are well written. Palpitine, Isard, Daala, Pestage and Tarkin are also well written.Kyle Katarn and Corran Horn are good. It is a pretty good book."
5,CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THE EX1300,"i don't know how many backpacks and satchels i've gone through since purchasing a laptop. the LOWEPRO EX1300 is the best thing i've come across. smart pockets, awesome construction and very comfortable. what more do you need? a good price of course! compared to the higher priced bags out there, this backpack smoke them in the dust. a very good and wise investment. you won't be disappointed!"
4,An eye-opening personal account,"This book offers an interesting look into one woman's search for the meaning and experience of spiritualty. I think the book's layout (chapters devoted to different branches of religion, along with the brief histories of each group given at the start of the chapter) lend's itself to be (mis)interpreted as a non-fiction anthology. At times I felt the book was misinforming, especially on Unitarian Universalism, which is my own leaning. However, in retrospect, I think the author never intended to be an authority. Through this book I saw Catholic practices and rituals in a new light and with renewed inspiration, and had my interest piqued about Sikhs, Mormons, Amish and the Scientologists. I found the writing to be a little too ""pop"" for me at times, and generally like the content of the accounts more than her way of telling about them."
5,I just love them!,"I bought these for a mother-of pearl and gold pendant I already had, and they resulted the perfect combination! They are a very nice size, the pearls have a subtle sheen and the posts are gold, so no problem for sensitive ears! I got these through a gold box deal from Amazon for only $19.99, so I couldn't be happier. Great value for the price!"
3,earrings are ok,"These pearl earrings are ok value if they are advertised as fresh water pearls. However, I would expect Akoya pearls if that is what the listing says. Good thing is that there is no fuzz on the return."
5,Fabulous!!!,These earrings are so simple and elegant.....I will buy from this seller again! I think the price was really good and the shipping was really fast! I am so very pleased with my purchase!
5,Great Easy Listening Music,We were in an Italian restaurant and a CD was playing. The restaurant owner told me who the singer was and as soon as I got home I looked him up on Amazan. I love the entire CD. Alot of times you can order a CD and only like a few songs but all the songs on this CD are great.
1,"My friends told me to buy this cd, well.....................",Sometimes friends can help in decision making and sometimes they can hurt. In this case I should not have listened to anybody but me.This cd has turned out to be a disater for me. It has not been anything I had hoped for or needed in the way of enterainment.I think it would be best for Steve to turn his talents to something other than singing. In this case the majority of people are not right about Steve. Sorry!
5,Best Musical Surprise in a Long Time,"I never heard of Steve Tyrell until I got the reccomendation from Amazon.com and his music is fantastic. Since I bought this CD, I purchased ALL of his other CDs. Tyrell is going places!"
4,music to revive your memory,"It was really great to hear so many of the regretfully nearly forgotten, highly melodious tunes played and sung so charmingly.Thankyou Steve Tyrell."
2,Disappointing,"The first four books were some of my favorite books when I was younger. This book, unfortunately, fell short. I discovered Jenny Carroll (Meg Cabot wrote the first 4 books under that name) before Meg Cabot. It's odd how the same person can write SO differently under two different names; one focusing more on action and plot, the other focusing more on romance. While the first 4 books center around a strong, independent, and funny girl named Jess, this book, which was finally attributed to Meg Cabot, reads like the Princess Diaries. Jess turns in to Mia Thermopolis, spending most of her time whining about a boy. When I first read the description saying Jess had been changed by the war, I was really excited to meet this darker, more mature Jess. I think Meg Cabot had some good ideas but it just work out as it should have. Like another reviewer said, I would just recommend you pretend the 4th was the last one and skip this altogether."
5,THE EXCITERS,"I really treasure this cd of The Exciters Title ""Something To Shout About"". However there was this one song I just love listening as a kid and I finally was able to trace it and play it and bring back the memories how I was living then and etc...Actually the song was a flip side song ""I knew You Would"" .The delievery was fast and it was in new condition as it was suppose to be. I am happy customer. Thanks from musicmonster-dot-com A great buy...."
4,An inoffensive little appliance,"What can you say about a USB hub these days? It works. It doesn't smell or make noises. It doesn't need any software or configuration. It's an appliance, and a good one.It's not made to be admired on your desk. Stick it under there. At least all the USB outlets are on one side, rather than randomly distributed all over."
3,Rebate Beware!,"If you are considering the purchase of this D-Link hub because of the $20.00 rebate be advised to only use the online rebate form, if it is available. A direct rebate from D-Link is highly problematic, no matter how meticulously you prepare your submission or how dogged you are in pursuing the issue."
1,Need to re-boot when adding new item to hub - Vista PC,"For me this is a useless product. I have many external hard drives that I use for extensive photo and music back-ups.When I plug a new hard drive into the hub it is not recognized. Only way to get it to be recognized is to re-boot.D-link this is insane and a worthless product for me.A worthless hub, I like their router."
3,Got stiffed on the rebate,"I bought this cause it was a pretty good deal. After following the rebate directions and sending it in, I was denied the rebate for unknown reasons."
3,power lights ALWAYS on,"I purchased my D-Link USB hub as it had 7 usb2 ports and was recommended to me by a store clerk. It is both Mac and PC compatable and works great. The only thing I do not like about it is the fact that ALL 8 green lights on the front are ALWAYS turned ON while my system is powered on! When my room lights are turned off it lights up part of my room! I would understand that the power light be lit, but ALL USB ports that are not in use?! I would have made the power light lit and any usb ports currently in use, not everything. This is a waste of electricity and is an annoying glare."
4,Works fine,"I have this hub hooked up to a Dell 5100 laptop. Installation was quick and easy. I have not had any issues and have the following devices hooked up to it: Hp printer, Creative Labs Extigy sound card, Microsoft Optical mouse and Palm Hotsync cradle. Scanner is connected to the spare USB port on PC. In reading some of the comments, I feel the need to say that scanners and web cams historically cause problems when hooked up to any USB hub as they tend to ""HOG"" the bandwith leaving little for the other devices. I am surprised that D-Link claims to have not had complaints on this issue. My advice would be to hook these items directly to the pc's USB port and use the hub for the other ""less power hungry"" devices."
3,Does not charge ipad 3,"I like the size and looks of this 7 port hub. However, it does not charge an ipad 3, which is why I specifically purchased it. Works fine with my other USB port needs."
1,Drops HP Printer,"I tried this hub for two months with only one printer plugged in (HP CLJ2550L). After approximately a half a day, the hub ""goes to sleep"" and the printer is not recognized.The only solution I found was to unplug the power supply from the hub and plug it back in to ""reboot"" it. This is inconvenient for me because I need to have the hub installed behind a desk where I cannot get to it easily.UPDATE (11 Sep. 2008)I replaced the D-Link hub with a Targus ACH82EU 7 port hub. It has worked continuously for more than 10 days now without dropping any peripherals off-line.It appears the D-Link hub was the problem. Definitely not recommended."
2,Dying one port at a time,D-Link DUB-H7 High Speed USB 2.0 7-Port HubI've had this hub for 14 months. Hooked to an i-Mac it started good. I've lost one port at a time and I'm currently at 1 functional port on this hub. It should have done better; when the new hub arrives it is going straight into the trash.
1,not enough power to handle multiple items,This device has gotten worse over time and seems not to find it's built in power source.
1,A must to avoid,"After installation, I noticed my printer wasn't working and it was this hub. I had to unplug and replug the printer at the hub. The same with my keyboard and later the same with my cam. Their online support said to try it on another PC, but I don't have another PC. After that, they wouldn't reply to my emails. It's junk."
3,where's the power,"I purchased this to use with my samsung slate and it has held up to all of my needs. The only downfall I can say about this product is that the ""rapid USB chargers"", well lets just say from my experience there is nothing rapid about them. They appear to charge my ipad and ipod and the same rate as a standard USB port."
5,D-Link DUB 0-H&,"I just received this usb hub three days ago. It does come with a 100-240 volt power supply so it is perfect for international travelers. The hub does require that you use the power supply. The hub has two fast charging 1.2 amp ports for charging your smart phone or tablet. You have to unplug the hub from your computer before the hub changes these ports to fast charging. You may ask do I need seven ports for a travel hub? Well at the moment i have my iphone, IPad2, a wacom graphics tablet, a memory stick, a scanner, an audio input usb device and a card reader for my digital camera memory cards plugged in. The hub is good looking shiny black with a rubber pad on the bottom to protect any surface you put on from scratches.So far none of my devices have had a problem operating through the hub."
2,A powered hub with not enough power,"I bought this to hook up 7 different USB products. Unfortunately, even though it is a powered Hub, several of the products plugged into this hub would not work through the Hub: they needed to be plugged directly into my iMac. I got an error message saying that the hub could not supply enough power to connect my keyboard, my iPod, or my mulit-photo card reader. The power light was on, but somehow it did not produce enough power. The product was useful in organizing my cables, but was not useful in enabling me to avoid having to plug and unplug my USB products repeatedly. Not recommended for this reason."
3,Product has changed!,"We use several of the bluish ones since years, as the current image is.These felt stable and durable. Zero problems, great quality.The new one arrived this week, it is black and the enclosure feels kind of cheap. My initial thought was I send it back, not fully decided yet.So far we have nothing than good results with the old version.I wish that Amazon would update the images.Edit: I kept the new version and it is working just fine, I have four disks on it, and two card readers. I work with it 7 days 12 hours with it. No problem."
5,As advertised.,I bought two of these so I could stack them and add additional drives to my system. The were a snap to install and work great. They stack so take up little room. Recommend them.
5,Awesome 7 port Hub,"This has to be one of the best USB hubs I have found. 7 ports, powered with A/C cord. USB 2.0, all ports have a green LED that stays on constantly. Works flawlessly on my iMac. I highly recommend for someone who needs this many ports. They are easy to use, see and plug into. Stays cool to touch, and is in a stylish chrome plastic case, which matches many of todays high tech computers. Well worth the money, a real winner!"
5,USB port makes it easy to connect additional devices,"I purchased this port to expand the number of 2.0 capable ports on my computer. The advantage of this unit is that it has so many ports available on one small package. I placed it on my mini-tower where it is easily accessible to plug devices in, such as my digital camera, GPS unit, etc. I only had one issue with installation, where it was not recognized correctly when initially hooking it up to the computer. It turned out to be a USB motherboard driver issue. I simply downloaded the latest drivers for my motherboard and the problem disappeared.Overall, a good port for the money."
5,Good bang for the buck,I have 4 of these USB hubs and all 4 were purchased replace failed Belkin USB hubs of one design or another. The D-Link is solid and just works as it should. One small hiccup is the way the connectors are placed that leave wires exposed on my desk. But I'll trade that small situation for the speed and reliability of these devices.
3,"Good, but not perfect","I have two 7 port hubs, this one and the Q-Stor model QU2RCT7 with the flashing leds. I have had some trouble with a MIDI keyboard using this, but it works fine in the Q-Stor hub. Sometimes I get a power problem with this one - like a short on connection that requires a reset. This doesn't happen on the Q-Stor."
3,Broke immediately,"I accidentally switched the power brick between this (5V) and my D-Link router (7.5V) which ruined the USB hub and a keyboard/mouse connected to it.Why am I telling you this? Because this device has no on board regulator, it passes whatever voltage comes from the brick directly on to your USB devices. USB spec states that devices should be able to tolerate up to 20V, but as I have found first hand, that isn't always the case.A regulator that accepts a wide range of input voltages and outputs a steady 5V is extremely inexpensive and D-Link would have been wise to add that to this device to make it more robust."
4,"Power-surge ""problem""","I may stay with DUB-H7 in spite of its single (for me) problem, due to D-Link quality reputation. Some ports had begun to fail on my previous USB2 hub, forcing replacement. Even after warranty replacement of DUB-H7, DUB-H7 still has same single problem (NOT a problem on previous hub). To avoid ""power surge shutdown"" when I plug in a 2.5"" 20GB HDD, I must use a 2nd USB2 cable (with the HDD) to provide adequate power.I recommend DEGUNKING YOUR PC (Ballew/Duntemann, c2005) pp133-153, excellent tutor on at least SEVEN major USB(2) issues!bandwidth degradation re: splitting ports, USB1.1 devices mixed with USB2 devices, multi-TT;need for powered ports; isochronous device issues;thumb drives (power, and port-connector size); care of USB cables."
2,Unreliable,"This hub has 7 ports, and is quite compact. Those are all things I like. However, I have found this hub to be unreliable. From time to time, one device connected to the hub will stop working. Just disconnect and reconnect the device, and everything gets back to normal. The interval between two incidents can be of a few hours or a few days. I have a keyboard, mouse, headset, printer, and scanner connected to the hub, and never have any problem like this when they are connected directly to my laptop.For a while I thought this was maybe problem specific to my Windows machine. Lately I got a MacBook Pro, and was surprised to have exactly the same problem with that machine as well. So this is definitely some problem with the hub, or of the interaction of the hub with the devices I am using.Bottom line: I can't use this hub.So my verdict is: not recommended."
5,The Hub-a Dub-Dub,"This little jewel of a four-way Hub is great for connecting up to four devices(peripherals) to your PC or Laptop computers. It is very small which does not take up much desk space. It could be mounted securely, using Velcro strips, to a desk partition, the side of your PC or, anywhere else that is handy in your environment."
1,Worthless,"I bought this hub (two of them, in fact), lured by the promise of High-Speed USB ports and the fact that it was ""powered."" The only thing the plug adapter seems to power, however, is the light that tells you it's plugged in. The $5 cheap-o unit I had hoped to replace did a better job of maintaining connection with external drives (which constantly spin down/ramp up using this unit), and even my Wacom tablet refuses to connect through these overpriced pieces of Dlink. No smart phone -- from the iPhone 3GS to an ancient Android -- can be charged with this unit, and many devices just plain don't seem to connect at all (and those that do don't stay connected for long).Extremely disappointed."
5,Great little usb hub,"This is a great little usb hub. I have it on my desk and use it to charge all of my little gadgets, the extra 2 plugs for just charging work great and I think they do charge a little faster."
3,A good yet flawed USB Hub,"This was a great little USB Hub while it lasted; failed after 2 years 5 months.Prior to failure it seemed to work well. Its failure was to no longer provide power to connected USB devices from the wall-plug power module.When utilized with Windows Vista I didn't see my USB hard disks, attached through the hub, appear in my computers list of attached devices; I couldn't disconnect attached hard disks.... D-Link tech support never responded to my question on that subject."
5,When we get home was simply amazing!!,"This film was such a help for me and my wife. The convenience of watching a how to movie in lieu of reading a tedious book was monumental. The arrangement and the flow of the video exceeded my expectations and left me wanting more. I recommend this video to all new and experienced parents with a passion to provide all that their child needs. Not only parents, but hospitals around the world should show this video to all mother-to-be's!!!"
2,review,"Bathroom ceiling heater. Heats good, but makes rattling noise. Tried several things to quiet the thing, nothing works. Just plain noisy."
4,Information-Packed Book,The book is very well written and researched. I especially appreciated the history of the Native Americans who created the blankets and their interactions with the Spanish.Joe Ben Wheat's collection of Native American blankets is being exhibited in three separate mini-collections (because of the limited space at the museum) at the University of Colorado's Natural History Museum. Two friends and I attended the first exhibit last week and thoroughly enjoyed it!
2,briefest of thrills,"this is a trifle,with nary a redeeming thing to offer. RyanO'Neal,Robert Downey, and Cybil try to save this thinlyplotted farce, but alas, not to be done. This dog waffleson forever,but pays back little except Cybil in a slip,which come to think of it,is probably worthwhile for thoseof you with freezeframe. Elsewise, be forwarned:this dogwon't hunt. The premise of Chances Are, couldn't be soldto the point of suspenion of disbelief for even a glimmer.An acting exercise, no more.All of the principals havedone far better."
2,Big Hit From The Summer Of Sam,"First ""album"" I ever bought, this was. Title track still cool in a nostalgic sort of way. Signed,Sealed,Delivered was good too but the rest.........hhhhhhhmmmmmmm."
1,Do not buy the Kindle edition!,"I'm a beginner ukulele player.Yes the chords are annoying as they do not correspond to ukulele but to a fretted guitar, but the worst of it is that most of the pages look like a cheap photocopy. I have tried on my kindle as well as my PC and the image is really bad, sometimes impossible to read. I wish I have bought the printed version of the Ukulele tab."
4,SCI-FI!!!!!,Another entertaining Monogram early sci-fi drama. The Alpha DVD is actually quite good on this film. Although I would still highly recommend the Roan version instead(it's on a double-bill with Human Monster).
3,loved it but they have changed it,been using this product for 10 years but they have now changed it and way to sweet so don't use it anymore.
5,Jaffel??,"Being from australia, i loved our jaffel maker over there. I needed a replacement since being in america and i brought this sandwich maker. It works well. A little time consuming with the clean up. I likes when my bread used to be larger than the actual machine so it would create a hard crust, this never seems to happen though. This is however a great product especailly for the price."
5,"Great sandwiches, easy clean up","I usually don't like to clutter the kitchen with one-use gadgets, but this thing sure is fun. Try fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and parmesan on italian bread, or turkey, swiss, and thousand island on white. It's foolproof--in four minutes the bread is crispy and golden on the outside, the cheese melts perfectly, and the whole thing cleans with a paper towel wipe down. Get some cooking spray and be creative!"
5,A true British classic,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.This film is based on the play by George Bernard Shaw. The film was even scripted by Shaw so it definately is the best version of the film.The story later inspired the much more famous musical film ""My Fair Lady"" I have not seen ""My Fair Lady"" so I am not one to compare.The film follows a phonetics and linguistics expert, Henry Higgins. He has such a knowledge of accents that he can tell what town a person is from by hearing them speak for only a few seconds. He later makes a bet with a colleague that he can train a common girl from Cockney to speak ""proper"" English and fool people into thinking she is a duchess.The Criterion DVD has no special features but the picture quality is quite good for a film of its age.This film is one of my new favorites!"
5,AMAZING AND TRULY INFORMATIVE BOOK.,"You really cannot go wrong with this one if you have any interest in these wonderful little creatures what-so-ever. I have been watching, photographing, feeding and studying these little birds for years now. It is rather amazing that the author could pack so much information into one small volume and give us some wonderful photographs to boot. We here in Missouri have only the Ruby Throated, but, and I am lucky, I know, we are able to travel to other parts of the country and view other species. No matter how much you know of these birds, you are sure to pick up some new information in this work. As another reviewer pointed out, the photographs are well worth the price of the book. Recommend this one highly."
2,some relief but...,I have this splint. I did get some relief with wearing it at night for my plantar fascitis (heel pain) but my foot keeps sliding out at night because I cannot tighten it enough to get a good stretch. I sometimes tighten it and find myself waking to pain from the straps. I am going to try a dorsal splint.
5,Great Folk Album !,"With The Big Three led by Cass Elliot's ( later known as Mama Cass )brassy , powerful voice I don't see how this group could've done wrong . These songs are great ! Especially ""Wild Women"" , where everyone can hear the strength of Cass's voice . These songs make you feel like you're sitting in the coffeehouses listening to the greatest and grooviest group .. THE BIG THREE !"
2,Starts off with promise and goes downhill from there,"I could see this as a short story but it just got tedious. Chop about 10,000 words from it and it might be OK. Honestly, she notices all kinds of things in the world and in other people but seems so out of touch with her emotions the book doesn't fit together. She belongs in Princeton!"
3,Murda Afta Dark,I only like this one song Murda Afta Dark. It is worth buying the whole album for. I did just for this one song acouple others are good to.
1,Bad material & worksman ship/manuf,"The maker unit :1. The whole assembly is shakey, plasticky . After using it for 5 months it now sits like the pizza tower in Italy2. The filter chamber did not sit correctly since day-13. The timer has no memory, eachtime the power goes out you have to reset it manually.The Thermal Carafe:1. The handle of the Carafe shakes since day-12. Its easy to tighten the lid the wrong wayIt was gift , so could not return it. As I move next month I willbe glad to throw this $120 priced bad coffee maker in the trash"
2,I really tried to like this coffeemaker but...,"After doing *a lot* of research on buying a coffeemaker (our first) I decided on this Krups model. The first time I received it it had been so poorly packaged it was totalled, if that can happen to a coffeemaker. Amazon kindly resent a new one in better packaging but it too was received broken! The tiny bead that the coffee filter swivels on was missing, presumed broken somewhere in transit. Upon further inspection, the entire coffeemaker seemed to be cheaply made, lots of little plastic pieces.I'm sorry Krups, beautiful design and I tried to like you but I feel that the cost of this machine doesn't reflect any true craftmanship."
2,not for the long haul,"After doing a lot of research, I bought this coffee maker a little more than 2 yrs ago. I loved the features and the stainless steel caraf, but the main selling point was because of a reviewer who said she had hers for 8 years. Now, after a little more than 2, the timer has gone out, and there is no way to turn off the pot except to unplug the unit. It has turned into a fire hazard. Not sure what brand to buy now, as my $130 coffee pot will have to go the same way the Black & Decker & Mr Coffee's did in the past. Doesn't anyone make a quality coffee maker that's made to last?"
2,Very disappointed,"While I haven't noticed a lukewarm temperature as some reviewers have, my husband has complained that the coffee isn't as hot as with our previous coffeemaker. A coworker of his said the same thing and returned theirs. My big complaint is with the handle on the pot. We returned our first pot b/c it broke after about 4 months and now the handle on the replacement pot is also coming loose. Because of the design, it's impossible to tighten or fix on your own. Do yourself a favor and keep searching for a different model."
1,Don't buy this one!!!,"This is the worst coffee maker I've ever used! Using the same grounds and water, the coffee taste is very bad, not full flavored at all. Combine the lack of flavor with the fact that coffee is hot enough for only 10 minutes or so after brewing. The lack of heat retention is a problem even with doing all the right things (taking the caraf off of the machine and making sure the top is closed tight). I really don't think it brews hot enough in the first place. Even with my first cup, adding a very slight splash of milk, cools the brew to nearly lukewarm and all cups after that are hopelessly flavorless and cool. Don't buy this, you'll regret it!!!"
2,My Carafe is falling apart,"I don't write many reviews, but I second a lot of what I read here. The coffee isn't hot enough, and the machine leaks. The carafe is the biggest disappointment, it is actually coming apart. We've had the machine for less than a year, and the handle is coming off! I have also had problems with pouring the coffee and getting it all over the counter, much to my husband's amusement..."
4,good product for size,good product. very compact (folds flat) for travel. rugged enough to hold up to a full month of travel in my backpack. nice that it runs on batteries (4 AA) or AC and also charges the ipod. decent sound w/ ok volume. gotta love the tiny little remote.
3,"Worked for what I needed, but leaves a lot to be desired","I am reviewing this unit after owning it for about three years, after which it up and died on me one day. It functioned for what I needed it for, and I liked how it folded flat for transport/travel.On the positive side, the unit was dual voltage 110/220, which was great for me since I regularly travel between the U.S. and overseas.On the negative side, this unit never worked properly on the 4 AA batteries that were supposed to power it -- even when the unit was brand new, and the batteries were brand new out of the package.However, the sound quality was never great, it always generated a low humming/buzzing noise when any iPod (I had two, an iPod Touch 1st gen and an iPod 80GB w/video) was plugged into it. I have since purchased another unit to replace this one (see my other reviews if you're interested), and so far I am much happier with the other unit, despite the fact that the other one doesn't fold up flat like this one did."
1,Horrible sound quality,"I got this for Christmas. It's pretty cool-looking, but the sound quality sucks. The volume wasn't good, it would get distorted if you turned it too high. I was okay with that, but then I began to notice that even when I played music at very low volumes, I could hear this awful crackling distortion behind the music. It drove me insane. I returned it (luckily my dad had kept the receipt) and ordered anAthena iVoicewhich was only $10 more and has an amazing sound quality."
3,super silly and super silly fun,"ok i saw this when it aired as a showtime orignal movie in the 80's and thought is was silly fun. a few months ago i found it was running late night on a movie channel and used my dvd burner to burn a copy of it. the story of travel to another universe and the fight with the evil warlord is some great cheese film making,and kay lenz is hot to look at. a pg cheese fest, give it a try it's funny. also it says in the ad that people who bought this video also bought f. scott fitzgerald & the last of the belles ??? what kind of crack are they smokeing to put these two movies together????? (HAha) look for yourself"
3,Prisoners of the lost universe,"A silly (in a good way), entertaining tale, mostly for science-fiction fans: a professor discovers a way to access a parallel universe, but the real question is how to return home."
2,imaging drum,I'm still trying to get this resolved. The item was defective. I'm still waiting for a replacement.
5,Delivered fast,"The product was delivered very quickly. I held off on rating it, as I waited until I installed it. Works good, no problems, Pages are printing as expected."
2,stopped working in 2 weeks,"Someone sent me this for my zaurus. It worked for 2 weeks. There came a point where it wouldnt' work when i plugged it in, so i'd have to keep unplugging and replugging it until it finally caught on. After a few days of that, it didn't work at all."
3,No Need for a Ghost,"The Tenchi Gang is still in space, making thier way to Jurai. Along the way, Sasami meets a ghost of a girl, two idiots that steal Yagami, and the search for food.This DVD keeps the plot up, but doesn't speed it up. The Tenchi Gang has a long way to go to reach Jurai."
5,Get ready to laugh!,"An outstanding, heart warming comedy about family. A movie that you can watch over and over and still enjoy each time. Highly recommended and hysterical - I laugh so hard each time I see this film that my sides hurt!"
5,Classic!,"The movie is great! The kids pull it out and watch it often. Good laughs for adults, too. This is a keeper."
5,Buck is Funny,"One of the late, great John Candy's best! Mccualay Calkin is in this one and he is cute.(he was probable around 4 or 5 when they made this one).You just gotta love Uncle Buck!Funny flick that is designed for more than one screening.Also check out Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."
4,funny and touching,"One of the late great John Candy's best. This is a funny film and in real life there are relatives just like Uncle Buck. This, I think, is Macauly Culkins first feature film. I recommend this."
2,Don't let Uncle Buck into your home,"I don't like this silly ole movie,even though I think Candy is a good comedian.And they play dorky music in it as well."
1,Causes Blue Screens in Vista and Windows 7,"When the network port in my laptop broke, this seemed like the perfect solution, and if it weren't for the really bad drivers, it might be. But, alas, within minutes of installing the device and its drivers, Windows started giving me blue screens and crashing. When the computer isn't crashing, the network connection fails regularly--to the point where I have to refresh my browser on almost every page load. In short: nice idea, bad implementation."
1,old technology,"I bought this because I just moved into a dorm with a wired internet connection, and my new laptop doesn't even have an ethernet port. Turns out, this isn't compatible with Windows 7."
5,D-Link USB 2.0 Fast Enet Adapter,A great solution to my laptop's ethernet port no longer working properly!Sturdier than another brand I tried.
2,Avoid,"This is ""Theory of Computing"" for dummies. There are very few examples, little mathematical rigor, and an unclear presentationof the topics. It seemed like the text used the Lewis & Papadimitriou table of contents verbatim, but presented the material very weakly. I would not recommend this book."
2,Not good enough for beginners,"This thin book is very easy to carry anywhere but the content of the book is not really satisfactory. I had to buy another similar book to understand some parts of this book. The problem exerciseparts are good. They have some good problems but when I get stuck on a problem, I had to open a different book to review before going on to a next problem. This book seems to assume that the most readers of this book already know what this book is talking about. This book may be suitable for those who already have enough knowledge on the theory and want to review and refresh the knowledge that they already had before."
1,It works!! But Only for a short time!!!!,"I purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now I am shopping for a different brand. It worked fine for the first summer season in Texas, but now that it is spring almost summer--it does not turn on at all. I have completed all of the manual's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it. But, it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage! I do not recommend!!!"
3,Flowtron works well but does not last,"This unit only worked for a month then it stopped working. It would not power on. I had to send it back to the company to have it repaired and paid for shipping myself. It's been now 2 weeks since it's been repaired but this time the fan stopped working. I've contacted the company again and waiting for a response from them. Other than the hassle of returning the product and paying out of pocket each time for shipping, this is a great product. It really works to reduce your mosquito population!***Update***6/27/11 - it's been 3 weeks since the fan to the Powervac stopped working. I've contacted the company over 2 weeks and reported the problem. Finally after 3 emails, someone responded stating to clean the fan. Cleaned the fan as stated in the manual and still no success. Still waiting on a response for next step to getting this product fixed. Not sure if this will happen."
3,Flowtron PV-440 -- Seems to Help in MN,"We put the Flowtron out 3 weeks ago and have trapped a lot of mosquitoes. We live in the country, and have several ponds within 100 yards - prime hatching grounds for the pests.What we've noticed is a lot fewer mosquitoes at our back door, having put the device about 50' away near the woods/brush behind out house (at the edge of the lawn). The dogs used to bring them into the house all the time, but it is a lot better now.I am having trouble finding the refills, so my success may be short-lived.--Barb in MN June 16 2008"
3,Outdated,"This was a good book in it's day, but it is sadly outdated. Much of the information is still useful and it does have a solid approach to product development, but with the global market as it is, this book misses the mark today."
1,abysmal audio,"The sound quality is terrible on all movies, and is difficult to adjust. I would not recommend this purchase; purchase individual movies instead. International Velvet has violence not recommended for young children."
1,Great moview but horrible video quality,"These DVDs must be a very poor transfer of VHS tapes, because the aspect ratio is all wrong. There are flickers in every scene - again the sign of bad dubbing. A complete waste of money."
3,"a gift for the grandchildren who like horses, but have none",My granchildren liked all the movies. I gave them as presents and haven't seen them for myself.
5,Learning my decorating style,I was very pleased with the quality of the book and with how quickly I received it.
4,underrated,"This album totally grew on me. But after it did it really made me realize that it was one of the most underrated albums of the year. Ken Andrews knows his stuff, the work is solid."
3,"3.5 stars. Good, solid hard rock","My little brother pretty much summed up this album when I was giving him a listen. ""So it's all pretty much regular rock songs?"" Yup, exactly. Which is a good thing, but not a great thing. I totally dig this album, but can't really say any one of the songs is just amazing. They're all catchy and hard and melodic. Year of the Rabbit kind of remind me of Nirvana, except they lack the whole trailblazing thing.All in all, I recommend this album, but don't expect it to change your life."
2,Dull. With a side order of boring.,"Always a sad thing when you witness a gifted artist finally running out of ideas, and this is exactly what the YOTR album represents for Ken Andrews (ex-Failure front-man).Sounding like Failure might have if a crazed burglar had broken into their house and stolen their tunes and energy, this album starts promisingly and then immediately takes a detour via dirge-ville.The CD limps pointlessly from one instantly forgettable song to the next, still adhering to the older-than-sand 'quiet/loud' formula and bringing precisely nothing new to the table.The lyrics (including excruciatingly embarrassing '30-something-man still uses the F-word in songs' moments) would make a love-stricken teenager wince at their banality. Byron it ain't.Frankly rubbish, even for a big Failure fan like me."
5,Interesting Story the Whole Way Through.,"This is more a 4.5 star for me. I usually much prefer light, frothy Regencies for the humor and fun. This wasn't one of those, but it was an interesting storyline that didn't falter. The heroine was a serious character overall. I don't wish to be mysterious about the storyline but I don't want to spoil the suspense for any future readers out there. This was a solid Regency era story about a woman forced into maturing early and a man who appreciated her for it. All the supporting characters were also well written as very believable realistic people. I was surprised by how satisfied I felt at the end of the book. I closed the back cover, sighed and smiled. That's all I ask from a Regency."
5,Very nice product,"Very nice mirror, not cheap in either sense of the word. I do wish it could tilt further, but am glad to have it."
2,"NO VISTA support, bad communication","i bought this while back and just upgrade to vista recently. Vista recognize the adapter but has no profile for it. went to dlink website and i didn't see a vista driver. Email the customer service. they kindly responded me too look in to a page that has all the vista for Dlink products see if it's in there. NOO. Option 2, TRY xp driver.Trying is not my job. I bought the product i expect it to work. oh well, if you plan to upgrade to vista or already a vista owner. This adapter has no offical drivers for it as of FEB 23,2007"
1,D-Link Bluetooth USB Adapter,"This item does not seem to be compatibile with my Nokia Bluetooth enabled flip phone. My intention when purchasing this item was to use my cell phone as my internet connection as well as integrating the phone book in my cell with my ipod. So far, this item has no use to me."
1,Warning: Manufacturer's Product Description is Wrong,"The latest hardware revision (C1) of the DBT-120 no longer supports the WidComm drivers that are specifically named in this product's description. If your application requires that driver, as the Lego Mindstorms NXT does, this adapter will NOT work."
2,C1 version will NOT work with Mac Pro!!,I just purchased this and found that I had received the C1 version. This version will NOT wake your Mac from sleep mode. I'm going to return it.Models with versions of B2 through B4 are not affected by this issue.Here's proof from Apple:[...]
1,bad size,"For two USB slots, once you put this bluetooth you can not use the other port because its thickness interferes with other USB use!!"
1,Just Say No,"From the reviews, it looks like MAC users have better luck with this than Windows users. I tried to install on Windows XP and it never worked. Just say no."
1,NOT for WinXP SP2,"Useless, completely, I've been in IT for 6 years and after 8 hours of trying , 3 calls to tech support, and reading through every newsgroup I could google....Nothing. Even after the convoluted installation process, it still never works. Hopefully the more recent revisions are better but I'd stay safe and buy from a different company."
2,D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth Adapter a disappointment,"This adapter was difficult to install. I had to get D-Link's assistance. Once installed, it kept uninstalling. I bought it to link my cell phone to my computer. During the attempt to pair the cell phone to the computer, I was asked to provide a passcode, which I couldn't find, so the whole thing was an exercise in frustration. I ended up buying a USB cable to link the phone to the computer."
5,"On a Mac, just plug it in and it works!","I think the booklet that comes with it says it all. For Windows, installation is a 5-page, multi-stage process that requires installing drivers. For Mac, it's basically one short paragraph: ""plug it into a free USB port and it's ready to go."" And that's exactly what happened on my G4 running OSX. I have the rev-B4 version. I recommend that Mac users go to the Apple site and download the firmware updates for the D-Link, along with those for the wireless Apple keyboard and mouse. It fixed some problems with waking a sleeping Mac by clicking on the mouse or keyboard (which didn't work prior to the firmware update). Now it works great."
2,"""Not our problem""","Tried for hours to get this adapter to work with my Treo 680. My device is detected when I use the adapter, but I am unable to make a connection. Finally, called D-Link technical support. First response was that they had never heard of the product; next response was that I needed to select a different number on the support phone tree; last response was that the problem was probably with my mobile provider or PC. After many hours of installing and reinstalling the product; and trying to have my mobile provider detect any problems with data service; and contacting Palm technical support (waste of time since Palm wound up referring me to User Guide), I finally gave up.....and have returned the product. This should not be a difficult product to install, and is not worth the time and effort to teach the D-Link technical support individuals about their product."
2,DBT-120 for Non Savvy Computer Users,"D Link DBT-120 Bluetooth software does not have Digital Certification from Microsoft therefore it does not work without user manipulation. Each time I have used the product I have to go thru the entire sequence again in order to send and receive files. Trust me...go for another bluetooth device, even if you have to pay a lil bit more, which has Microsoft digital signature to ensure compatibility and true versatitlity of the product."
5,"Good ergonomics, fast","Notwithstanding the poor review this kettle got elsewhere here, I went ahead and bought this one since it seemed to have all the features I was looking for. My previous kettle, an old large base, traditional electric had finally self destructed by leaking all over the place. In comparison, the Krups has been a dream kettle. The features that I appreciate include: small footprint, cordless main unit, easy to use controls, shuts off quietly when done boiling (no steam condensing everywhere since the pour spout is closed when heating), good external water level readout, large enough capacity, and fast heating times."
2,Lasted for 2 years,All company claims are a lie. After 2 years it takes long time to boil 10 cups of water; Heating element DOES NOT resists mineral buildup; Filter DOES NOT keep mineral flakes out of cup; filter falls out of the kettle; Safety system DOES NOT prevent splashing. Good to use for a year or two.
4,Great Latin Text,"Very moving, deep and entertaining....come on, its a text book, it does what its supposed to do."
5,Bonus Buy,"I've been looking for a book to teach myself Latin, mainly to help with my research while completing my Masters in Ancient History. Until now I haven't had a lot of luck until I found this book referenced. It is great and when you use it along with its companion Latin Grammar, the skies become clear and the rain stops falling. I hope that you like it as much and find it as useful as did I."
5,Res evil 4,If you are a fan of the game and or any of the first of the three movies you will enjoy this the 4th instalment and it will leave you hopeing for a 5th movie.
4,Resident Evil,I have enjoyed the other Resident Evil movies that I have received but for some reason Mila did not look the same. It may be that she is just a little older.
5,Resident Evil: Afterlife,"Very cool film. Lots of action and guns. Zombies, monsters and more! These Resident Evil films are the modern monster flicks. Very cool!"
5,This really isnt bad!,"People criticize this movie because it is so unrelated to the games and it lacks a good story. Ok, it's a movie! Why would you want it to follow so closely to the games? Then what's the point of actually watching it? And I don't think the story is bad either; its a good leadoff for Retribution."
3,End of the line,"The first two films in the series had reasonable plot, believable scenes, good actors and superb choreography. This film shows none of those. The series seems to have run its course."
2,A Train Wreck,"Any ties to reality that you may remember from original Resident Evil movie have officially been purged from the series with this sequel. The action is so preposterous and tacky that it's painful to watch, and the plot itself is no better. Every wording and phrase comes off as pretentious - you can tell that they were trying to get a specific vibe for the series, but it it's impossible to feel any sympathy for Alice and cohorts as characters. There's no tension, and thus no real horror; it's a superficial action flick with sci-fi elements have have completely fallen off the rails. It's a train wreck, and I advise that you completely avoid this film. I gave it two stars because the effects used are decent, and I suppose you'll like it if only for the dash of violence between the utter ""suck"" the rest of the film is."
4,Amazing in 3D,"3D in home video is an amazing development, and this movie, filmed in 3D, delivers a great viewing experience. In my opinion, the first and fourth episodes, both directed by Paul Anderson are notably better than the other two in terms of story, camerawork, and particularly as regards the soundtracks, and sound in suspenseful movies is after all what creates the atmosphere. I hope he directs the fifth, and I hope it's done in 3D."
1,Awful!,"Probably the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. How is it possible that this movie got funded, made and released? The acting is just plain awful and the story was a mess. Zero stars."
2,Worst Res Evil Movie - and I loved the first 3,"I wish this 4th installment of Res Evil was better - especially considering how amazing the first 3 were. I was more than excited for another chapter of Res Evil - but this movie is awful. Maybe it would have been great in 3D at the theater, but I am reviewing the DVD. I thought the plot was weird and non-existent, the zombies sucked, the storyline was boring and hard to follow and some of the acting was almost painful to watch. I actually bought this DVD, watched it, then immediately put it up for sale. Maybe if you were a die-hard Res Evil video game fan, or read the books, you would like it. For the solely movie fan like myself - it was a big disappointment. At least I have the first 3 to re-watch."
1,Do Not Buy. Do Not Rent. Maybe watch if someone pays you.,"This movie is horrible. The third movie ended in a fashion that made you think you could guess how the this one would proceed. No. That ending is resolved in the first ten minutes.The first movie was pretty good. I bought that one and the next two. But these have gotten progressively worse and this one is just flat out bad. This is a 3D movie and you could see scenes where the story was set up so that some 3D action would happen, but in reality, things would have proceeded just as well if they hadn't tried to set up the 3D shot. Well, the whole movie is like that from a plot standpoint. So many things could have been dropped and no one would ever know they were gone. Primarily because you're generally wondering ""Where'd that come from?"""
3,Resident Evil Afterlife 3d DVD,This video is ok but needs better 3d effects. The storyline is just like the other Resident Evil movies so lacks the excitement it should have. This seller delivered it on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this seller highly.
4,It's good enertainment,I own all four in the series. You just need to like fantasy or scifi to appreciate the whole series.
4,andropause from a menopause oriented presentation,"Dr. Greene has the contempory in depth biochemical knowledge of hormonal sequencing in our human genders. Although his emphasis is on menopause, he adds great depth to previous writing done by Dr. Tan (Geriantologist) and subsequent done by Dr. Eugene Shippen (Internist) concerning the issue of Andropause. What all contributors cannot provide to the male gender is the contemporary studies done on humans of both genders concerning estradiole, testosterone and human growth hormone in terms of end of life bodily systems."
4,It's about time...,"This is the volume that actually jump starts the Wedding Peach plot. Before was a very long introduction and character establishment. Now that it has passed, volume three sends the Love Angels into understanding the history of the war they're fighting and comprehending how important their role is. Though the story doesn't become darker, it's a bit somber at times (especially in later volumes) which, I think, most will find refreshing.Volume three is a reward for getting through the first two, and a nice passage into the final volumes that are definitely worth reading (especially if you've come this far)."
3,Quick,I received the book in a timely matter and got the book rather quick! The only thing I had a problem with was the condition of the book was not as described by user. It wasn't in the best condition..
5,So Many Great Ideas,"This book is full of great craft ideas. My favorite is the materials and activity indexes at the end. Say you have some extra paper towel rolls you want to make a craft with, just look it up, turn to the pages listed and there are several ideas of how to use them in a fun and creative way with your child. This book has inspired me to try some new things - it's bringing out the artist in my child and I. Each craft project has a list of supplies you'll need, steps to make it, and activities you can do with it. Music, movement, dramatic play, math, language, etc. are included with craft ideas. The author also lists related books you can read along with your project to make it a real learning experience. This book is so much fun! It's not just for teachers; it's a must for parents who want to do arts and crafts with their kids."
4,Nice resourse,"I bought this book for my daughter, who has two small boys. They love arts and crafts and this book has plenty of great ideas. Well organized and plenty of variety. Directions are simple and illustrations are heplpful. She loves it."
3,"It's okay, but not great.","I received this book as a gift, because I had added it to my wish list. It really isn't any better than a quick web search and most of the crafts are such standard fare that even my group of 2-3 year olds had already done many of the crafts."
2,The American Spice Girls,"Don't bother buying this CD to support this group because they are already history, victims of a fickle music industry that put out one too many clones of the Spice Girls or the Backstreet Boys and are now suffering the well deserved backlash. These girls wrote none of the music on the album. I read that Britney Spears almost joined Innosense before deciding on a solo career, perhaps the wisest decision she ever made. I want to see more girl groups playing instruments and writing more of their own tunes (like the Go-Gos or the Bangles), so I won't bother with manufactured groups like Innosense. To me, they are NONSENSE!!!"
3,Introduced the kids to a classic,"How else are they going to know about the classic shows? A little pricey for an old, short tv show, but you only have to see one to have seen them all. Still cheaper than going to the movies."
1,this is not the original scooby doo first season,"These are from 1976, not the original from 1969. I bought the first and third season on instant and it turned out to not be the actual first season. This is the scooby doo SHOW (I guess) while the originals are ""scooby doo where are you?"""
3,okay,"The book was a great read, and I was glad to get it at a reduced price. There were some annoying comments that had been written in the book on the first 50 pages or so. After that it was fine."
5,Fascinating Story,"This is a well-written story of an incredible life. Dawson lived through so many different era's, his perspective is an important one. I wished the book had dealt more with his experiences during the 1960's as well."
4,Interesting,"ReWas s good rezd and was a review about racism, old farm ways. Neat that at 98 he still learned to read was so awesome. Highly recommended for baby boomers."
3,Not recommended,I would not recommend it. Tedious and could not engage me. It was not enthusiastically received by our book club.
4,Good book,Have not had a chance yet to read all of the book but have gotten great reviews from other practitioners. Not super crazy about the title.
5,perfect for their intended purpose,"Last hunting season I got two of these as a sample with some Buck Fire scent, the convenience of being able to dip your scent wicks straight into the bottle without spilling/wasting any of that spendy and foul smelling liquid is great. If your the type like me to reuse a scent wick during a season I recommend keeping them in seperate ziploc baggies and cutting a little off the corners and tips of the wicks and then leave an out line of that wick on a particular bag if you don't want to mix certain scents."
3,"Rob Halford, Solo?","I have been a Rob Halford fan for fifteen years. I always felt that his voice carried his previous band to the top. On this release, he does not use his voice to the heights that I have heard in the past. He may be attempting a different singing style. The lyrics on this CD seem a little shallow, also. I look forward to his next release."
5,Judas Who?,"This album kicks ass! If you are a Metal Head then GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM! Well go on! Stop reading this silly review and pony up the dough for the best Judas Priest album they never made. This album picks up where JP's ""Painkiller"" left off and never looks back. Halford's post Judas Priest career has had its highs(Fight: War of Words), middles(Fight: Small Deadly Space) and lows(2 or Two?), but Resurrection is the new pinnacle of his career. The energy is undeniable and there is not one bad song to be found on this album. For older metal acts searching for relevance(Metallica, anyone?), this album is a demonstration on how you got hit it big in the first place. So for all you metal groups and fans out there, THIS IS HOW YOU DO METAL!!!"
3,Barry is best in small doses,"I have always enjoyed Barry's columns, but this is the first time I have read a whole book of his stories. These are ""classic Barry"" stories, irreverent, often childish, no holds barred kind of humor. Yes, they are funny, but to me, they weren't so funny when I tried to read them one after another. They were much funnier when I just left the book laying around and picked it up once every few days and read a story or two. Maybe ""a Barry a day"" would be good."
2,Readerwriter,"Grisham's copy editor must have been asleep at the wheel on this book. I'm about 30 pages into the story, not too impressed at this point, although it is a page turner, until I stumbled on one narrative passage on page 12: ""heavy man with the red face was running through the weeds, holding on to the car and growling."" Can anyone say dangling participle? How does one run through the weeds while holding on to a car? That's some trick. He could have shuffled, side stepped, or what have you, but run? I mean, this is Grisham for God's sake. I would assume that he'd have better copy than this, not to mention better sense than to write such grammatically incorrect sentence."
5,"A 11yr. old, a lawyer and the Mafia","If one was to go merely by the reviews online this book would have been overlooked. This book has everything a 'good book' should have. The book opens up with Mark, a 11 year old boy who is in the woods smoking with his younger brother, Rick. They see a black car pull up and watch in suspense as a man attempts to committ suicide. You have to get this book to find out the whole story. I loved it from the beginning to the end! I most definitely will be reading more books by him.Highly recommend!"
2,What!!,I just want to mention how disappointed I am with the Kindle prices on all of these John Grisham books. It seems like they should be lower. I could go to the bookstore and buy the paperback for this. Or get it even cheaper at a used book store. Just saying...
3,Drags on for too long,"Nice, compelling story, but the book drags on for too long. 460 pages is too much for this story. John Grisham should've told it in half the time. Sometimes repetitive. Certainly worth reading, but John Grisham has much better books (The Testament, The Brethren, A Painted House,...)"
2,a lot of buildup for nothing,"What exactly is exciting or suspenseful about the plot of this book? Boy discovers secret of crime, boy is chased by feds, boy is made to divulge his secret. Grisham milked that secret for 400+ pages, and then at the end we don't even learn the outcome of the case or whether the boy and his family are found. Most boring read in a long time."
5,Different Feelings,"This is the first book that I read by John Grisham and I think it is a great book. During the time that I was reading it, I had so many different feelings. I thought that the book was scary, sad, and funny all at the same time. In this book there is a little boy who gets himself in so much trouble. The boy has a smart mouth. He also is a quick thinker because of how fast he makes hi scomments. Most of all I thought that ""The Client"" was a funny book. I plan to read many more books by John Grisham."
4,A PAGE TURNER THAT KEEPS YOU UP ALL NIGHT!,"I've been asked by my Dad on numerous occasions to put the book down and go to sleep. The book really is that good, it keeps you hooked from page 1 to page 560+. The characters are very real and you feel you know them. The plot is simple but makes for a very good read. Just in case you wonder, I am 13 years old and despite this, I enjoyed the book immensely. This is my first John Grisham novel and I look forward to reading many more of his books."
3,three stars,"I rate the book with three stars, which means average. It wasn't bad at all, but it was a little bit far-fetched for me, because I can't believe that an eleven-year-old boy would be able to hire a lawyer all by himself and so such things like Mark Sway does in this book. How can a boy at that age be so clever and always helps himself?! I think it would be more interesting for me to read the book in the original version or to see the film. Another reason for giving only *** was that there was no excitement in it for me. I really like terrifying books, but this one was a little bit boring. Positive about reading it was that I was able to enlarge my vocabulary."
4,Good Book,"This book was set in a little town. This was a very well written book about a teen who watches a man kill himself. This is not such a big deal, until they find out that he is defending a man on trial for the murder of Senator Boyd Boyette. The little boy and the murder are the only people now that know where the body is buried. The boy is being threatned and questioned by many police officers. The boy has grown up in a trailer park with his mother and his little brother. He hires an attorney. The attorney defends him and then she outsmarts the authorties. They tried to question him without the consent of his mother. The ending of the story is the best. It was a very good book."
5,The Cleint,"This book was excellent, with its good plot and good climax. The characters were very real. The story took place in Louisiana with a story about kids that witnessed a suicide and thought the mafia was after them. The characters were Mark, Ricky, Dian, Jerome and doctor green. Mark and Ricky were walking in the to have a cigarette. After about 5 mins. A black Lincoln pulls up and stops about 40 ft from were the boys are sitting and stopped. Mark and Ricky were about to run when Mark said let's stay here and see what's going to happen."
3,Too Long for Its Story,"Grisham has written a number of great legal thrillers, but this isn't one of them. The story revolves around a young boy who witnessed a crime and is now being hunted by organized criminals. He gets help from a lawyer, who tries to make a bargain with the state for his testimony. Unfortunately, the final solution which the boy and his family accept was the same as one proposed and rejected by the family several hundred pages before. The book is fast-paced, and even quite tense and intriguing in some places, so it is not a book to avoid. You just must look past the obvious solution and the cop-out ending"
1,I Could Not Finish This Stupid Book,"This was one of his worse books. What a dumb plot. Basically, this kid was running from the good guys. It was really stupid and boring. They made a movie of this story line. The acting was superb, but again the plot was retarded. Susan Sarandan and the kid running from the bad guys and the goods guys. Stupid stupid stupi"
2,Riddled with logical inconsistencies.,"I don't think Grisham really thought too much when he wrote this book. I can't specifically discuss the many lapses of logic in the story line without giving away the plot. Suffice it to say that I found the story that Grisham wove to be most unrealistic, and frankly, downright silly. He paints Mark as a clever, wise beyond his years 11-year-old, yet some of Mark's reasoning towards the end of the book is weak even for a typical 11-year-old. He paints Reggie as a woman who is wise in the ways of the world, yet she makes errors of judgment that in the real world would get her disbarred, and probably land her in jail.All in all, a big disappointment."
2,Unconvincing characterization,"A good juicy plot with all the makings of a page turner, truly in the spirit of pulp fiction. But most or the characters in the book (at least the main ones)are very unrealistic. The main character of an 11 year old child is absolutely rubbish. His lawyer a 52 year old lady behaves a no sane human being would. If u are looking for even a bit of substance or a pinch or relaity then dont even look at the book. BUT if u are seeking an engrossing plot and Grishams style, fast paced book, which u are willing to forget soon after or looking for pure entertainment the close ur eyes and give it a shot."
5,Thrilling; The Client- John Ghrisham,"This unpredictable thriller will leave you thirsting for more. After Mark witnesses a nasty suicide and is told a deadly secret, he's swarmed by FBI Agents and, of course, the Mafia.Pressured by the agents, Mark wraps up a plan with his lawyer, Reggie love. Now Mark is forced to spill, but comes up with an idea so crazy it'll keep you turning pages. I would definitely recommend this book to a peer, one that's ready for a good old thriller."
1,very disappointing,It was a very disappointing novel.John Grisham should take writing courses.He is a horrible writer!
4,Great singers bring great Gospel Music,"These are great artists, they bring great things to these favorites of mine. The songs bring back warm memories for me . Hearing some of my favorite artists sing these songs is a gift..from them to me ."
1,More Subliminal Baloney,"This book is just another example of Key's warped mind, looking for images of donkeys copulating in a picture of a clam-plate which appeared on a Howard Johnson's menu! Sure, every once in a while you can see things in ads, and sometimes they may have been placed there intentionally, but there is no evidence whatsoever that these subliminals have any effect on behavior. If Key had a doctorate in psychology rather than in journalism (or whatever) he would not write such malarkey. well, maybe he would since this has certainly been lucrative for him.If you want to find out the truth about subliminal stimuli, read ""In the Mind's Eye: Enhancing Human Performance""which was written by the National Research Council (National Academy Press). Now, have you found the hidden message in this review? If not, I'll be blunt: DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ!"
3,Fascinating! But don't take it seriously...,"I believe that Key is very honest and sincere in the way he presents his work, but honestly, does anybody take this kind of thing seriously? He obvoius has a very warped and twisted mind to see the things he sees in such innocent pictures.Truth is, if you WANT to see depictions of bestiality or what have you in a plate of clams, or a naked man on a packs of Camels, YOU WILL! That doesn't mean it is there, it just means the person who saw it there wanted to see it."
4,A lot can happen in only three hours,What I have to say that I liked most about this book was that it was written from the point of view of people who are not the doctors and nurses that seem to have the glamorous jobs. This was a down to earth and very human look at what happens at every public hospital in the country. I just wish the book had been longer.
4,Priceless,"I read a lot of both fiction and non-fiction, and I've read a great deal about Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway. I know in my life I always search for people I can look up to, people I can learn from and try to emulate. Charlie Munger is one such fella. This isn't a technical book about valuing stocks or putting together corporate acquisitions. This is, however, a book about Charlie Munger. He is a smart, honest, practical, hard-working man and I learned a lot from this. I am better off having read this book."
2,Snore fest,Charlie told her it would be a boring book and as usual he was Damn Right!You know this is a guy with interesting biz and fishing tales Im sure that could have been weaved into something good. The author's problem is she got so caught up in trying to write a time line of every little fact without much in the way of editing nor narrative. Its like fact vomit. Read this if your sleeping pills fail you.
5,A unique insight in Munger's private life and financial wisdom,Damn right is an account of Mungher's extraordinary pragmatism and financial wisdom which led him to bacome Buffett's partner in one of the most exciting fiancial ventures of recent history.
4,"Good, but as a complement","After read the first pages of this book, I found it a littlehard to read, It would be a good idea to read first ""IntroductoryTechniques for 3-D Computer Vision"" and then this book."
4,I like it,I purchased this chiminea and like it a lot. Its appearance is top notch. I have only used it a few times thus far but I cannot find a negative thing to say at all. Assembly could not have been easier.
3,Too simplistic,The pictures in this book are mostly if not all geometric. I prefer mandala's with flowers and leaves and such instead of all lines.
4,Very readable History,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a very readable book. Not being a huge history fan, I was unsure that I would enjoy reading the book, but I gave it a try. It held my interest with its style and interesting historical tidbits. I recommend you give it a try."
2,very bllues,You have to really like blues to like this collection. I'm sure its good; very good. But I don't care for it myself.
1,Configuration... doesn't work,"Trying to plug it into a Dell system (laptop) with Windows 2000 and USB 1. (not 2)...I can *read* files from the drive, but using the included software to try to format a disk results in a disc that the software says is formated (after 25 minutes of formating!) but doesn't work.So it is worthless. I am forced to chose between dealing with tech support (can't find this in the FAQ or anywhere else) or returning it to the store... and getting an Iomega, which is what I'll do."
1,Deep breath:(,"OK, this should be a very simple item to produce. It works sorta. Did they save a tenth of a cent on each one of these by making them a little too short? After 1000 they have an extra buck I guess.Once installed the PCV valve is being yanked backwards and is distorting the grommet it sits in. Not sure if I am going to cut the tube and add a patch hose or try to warm it up and stretch it but can't leave it that way.Dorman usually makes OK replacement parts but this one doesn't make the cut."
5,I save money,"I save about 30 dollar gettin this package,, on the stores youll find this much more expensive"
1,Total junk,"Total junk!Audio is terrible! You cant hear anything over staticVideo is a joke, it is very poor quality reminiscent of the times of VCR tape playback with bad tracking (even with adjusting).No auto alert/onYou have to turn it up so you can hear, but every 2 minutes it emits a Loud Static Squelch. Good luck sleeping next to that.Night vision doesnt work. More like you need a light on to see like its daylight. A small nightlight or pitch dark isnt enough for it.Pretty silly..\"
2,Demolition Man,"Nothing wrong with the movie, just my copy had full narration throughout the whole movie from the director and producer, hopeless."
2,Very disappointed in at least one of these films,all the other films look good for what its worth as advertised except for one. and of course that would be my favorite.Tango and Cash is NOT in 16x9 anamorphic format as stated on the back of the DVD. this is the same dirty print that was so shoddy in it's first presentation. let's hope Warner Bros does the right thing is replace the bad disc or issue a special edition of sorts
2,Tango & Cash not formatted for widescreeen TVs.,"While Demolition Man, The Specialist, and even Over the Top are in the 16:9 format for widescreen TVs, Tango & Cash is not. The video quality is pretty lousy as well. I feel like I'm watching this movie on VHS."
1,Not good,It broke after about the 4th use. Easier to just dip the capsules in the powder and snap them together one by one.
3,Ease of use may depend on how dry your climate is,"This capsule maker works best when the air and weather is dry. It doesn't work well during rainy season/humid weather. I read through all the (mixed) reviews. Although every reviewer did not indicate the area of the country they live in, one thing became apparent: reviewers who live in arid or dry climates (e.g., Arizona, Texas, Nevada), are delighted with this gadget because they have no complaints about the capsules sticking or not coming out easily. In my case, I think the moisture in the air where I live (SF Bay Area) affects the gelatin capsules (which I keep with dessicant in a tightly closed glass jar), thereby resulting in capsules getting stuck in the capsule maker. I'll just have to fill my capsules during the summer, when the weather is dry and the air has very low, or no humidity."
5,fantastic,just as described very easy to use. Never having done this before in my life and it is easy and defo makes life easier and cheaper when you make your own at home. I already have recommended this device to a friend
3,The capsule maker,"It's a great idea but poorly executed as already stated by someone else. Out of the 24 or so potential capsules, I might get 13 or 14. Some slots are too big and others too small for the empty ""0"" capsules. Otherwise it's a good enough product."
2,Not as easy as it sounds,"The filler is well made and good quality but I had a hard time making the capsules.Separating tops and bottoms to put in the filler, spreading the material equally to fill the capsules and tamping that down took more time than manually doing the job with each capsule. The cleanup after capping was an unexpected added chore.Personally I will go back to doing the job by hand, one capsule at a time."
1,Product does not work well at all,"I'd like to return the product, but I've already used it, or attempted to, rather. I followed the instructions precisely, and was unable to close the capsules. It was tedious, and just didn't seem to work as intended."
4,Product works well for the price,"Pleased with the product. Much better than trying to hand load individual capsules, but it is a bit tricky to use. With a bit of practice you can improve speed substantially. Each capsule has to loaded manually."
5,flipping amazing,"This book is awesome!! It is really interesting, it talks about how everyone met and got started. It states just exactly why Scott left the band (I was dying to know). Since it is written by the boys themselves and mark's sister anne, i'm pretty positive it is all true! This book has some wonderful pictures, and talks about hidden features in the music videos... for instance, did you know, in the m+m's video, when all the boys wake-up in different bedrooms, all those bedrooms are actually in mark's moms house! I thought that was really neat! This is just an awesome book and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who like the blink!!"
5,A GREAT BLINK BOOK,This book is really good it tells you everything about the guys. I am a HUGE fan of blink and i love them (especially tom)It really tells ya what they are all about. I advise any blink fan to get this book.Even if you not a fan you will surley learn to love them!
3,Disappointing from an Adult standpoint,"Maybe I'm losing my ""magic"" but this book just didn't impress me. I envisioned many stickers and lots of pages geared for make believe play. One small sheet of stickers in the back of the book, and busy pages throughout. Not alot of room for imagination.But then, I'm an adult. Maybe my 5 year old niece will think differently."
3,Not a great collection of quotes,"I was rather dissapointed in this. i got it years ago with some desk set, but never got around to reading it. Now, i find myself collecting quotes that i like, so i decided to read this collection. There were some good quotes, but most weren't. His division of the quotes was at times confusing. I think i could do a better job."
5,Touched By An Angel Fourth Season Vol. 2,Touched by an angel was a wonderful TV program. I am so grateful to be able to re-visit the show via these discs. The set came well wrapped and the case was in excellant condition. Keep up the good work. I hope Season 5 will be released soon. Thank you.
1,Never received the book,"I ordered this book on June 29, today is August 1 and I have not yet recieved it! I am not at all pleased."
5,Not like all the rest,"I first bought Cheryl's newer CD, ""Sweet Soul Light"" and liked it so much I had to hear more from her. And this CD delivered the goods as well. The CD is excellent and she is a very talented singer, songwriter and musician as is her band. Plus she's doing her own thing and it works. This is a refreshing change from the everyday norm. ""The music style is sort of, new age, meets folk, meets electronica with some pop and rock edge mixed in. Cheryl has a way of singing that is, breathy and soft but edgy and even a bit mystical and sexy too."" All I wrote in my review of her other CD applies here as well. All I can really add is both CDs are so good, I can't say which is better. I love them both.... I want more!!!"
4,"Overall great, a little difficult to pour","Overall I'm highly satisfied with these glass pitchers. They serve my purpose of avoiding plastic. Good size, fits nicely in the fridge. My only complaint is you have to be very careful during pouring. It seems as though no matter how I use them, a small amount ends up being spilled down the side of the pitcher."
5,Do not read reviews for this book.,"Although critical reviews for this book are accurate and give it much deserved praise, do not read them. Let Ellis Burt tell his story to you the way he wants to--give him his own timing. To know the story beforehand is to take away your involvemnent in the terrible and powerful discoveries that he must make as a human being: about others, his society, and himself. This is a tale of sin and redemption. To know his sins too soon is to underappreciate his redemption--what there can be of it."
3,Useful but unreliable,"I had found this wheel extremely useful until recently, when I came across some errors and lost confidence in it. For example, it incorrectly shows accents in the preterite for dar, ser, and ir. This may have been correct in 1933, when the wheel was copyrighted; perhaps the language has evolved since then.It's time for a new edition."
1,IT SUNK,"If I was to rate this movie I would give it an 'R' for 'rubbish'. I pushed myself really hard to watch to the end. It is boring and sluggish with a poor storyline. I felt embarrassed for the well known cast - Stephen Rea, Illeana Douglas, John Ritter, Dave Foley, Robert Patrick and Tom Arnold. You wonder why I even have this movie in my collection? It's my 29th Robert Patrick video. My one star is for him."
5,"George Foreman Grill, The Next Grilleration, GRP4B - Excellent","I love my George Foreman Grill. Removable grill plates are the most important feature. Mine did not come with the flat bottom plate. If you buy one, make sure you get the most recent version with the flat bottom plate.Grills by other manufacturers typically include several plates. I cannot find a set of flat plates or a set of waffle plates. With limited kitchen storage space, I cannot justify having several grills. Until this grill has all the typical plate options, it my be to your advantage to pass on this version of the George Foreman Grill."
2,doesn't brown your food,"I am referring to this specific model with removable grill plates. The plates just don't get hot enough to brown anything. I use a thermometer probe to check when my food is cooked. I can't believe that my chicken, turkey, and beef reaches 170 degrees and STILL no nice color on the outside. Turkey and beef turns gray when it's done, and chicken turns white. And since you continue to let it cook because it actually looks undercooked, the meat becomes overcooked and dry.Looks like the other models of this grill work well. By the way, i tried 2 different units because i thought the 1st one was defective. But nope, same results with the second grill. And i definitely let my grill preheat adequately. It's just a bad product."
4,Complementary readings to Pagels' interesting book,"There are already many good reviews to this book, so I will only suggest reading the following books on religion in addition to Pagels': a) ""The Phenomenon of Religion: A Thematic Approach,"" by Moojan Momen (astonishingly encyclopedic); b) ""Shamans, Sorcerers, and Saints: A Prehistory of Religion"" by Brian Hayden (great overview of religion origins and development); c) ""Life after Death. A History of the afterlife in Western Religion"" by Alan F. Segal; d) ""Alternative Tradition: A Study of Unbelief in the Ancient World (Religion and Society)"" by James A. Thrower; e) ""How to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now"" by James L. Kugel; and f) ""The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason"" by Charles Freeman."
3,"labor of Love, labored writng",definitive for all the historic reasons but clunky and labored.Still... the culture of the Roma is brought to life and at timesI found myself wanting to run away with them.
3,Had its ups and downs,"As a Star Wars fan , I was happy to see a book that informed me about things I may have missed, especially concerning the New Jedi Order. For the most part, from Episode I on, things seem smooth. As a gamer, I was almost insulted that Darth Revan of the Knights of the Old Republic series had a gender assigned, especially when the Exile of that game's sequel did not. Part of the game's fun was deciding things about that character, such as gender and fate, myself."
4,"Kreator's best album from the 1990's-""Cause for Conflict"" rips!","It is very hard to fault this record, and plenty of morons do. This is Kreator playing meaner, faster and more precise than any release since ""Terrible Certainty"".Founding drummer Ventor had left prior to this album, so ex-Whiplash/Massacre whirlwind Joey Cangelosi stepped up to the bat and knocked this one out of the ballpark. He is very technical, fast as all hell, and unleashes a brutal double bass drum onslaught on this album.The raw excitement and hardcore punk-ish energy propel this album to wicked heights.Highly recommended, especially for those disappointed by ""Renewal"" (a transitional album, but still good), and ""Outcast"", ""Endorama"", etc....Kreator still have it too, as the new album kills!"
4,Small product but big on features,"Strengths: Very compact; Able to read numerous formats (pretty much anything out there); Easy to use.Weaknesses: Slots should be labeled; USB cord is very short; Four drives show up in My Computer when inserted (not only the one that actually has media within).Summary: I purchased this item to cover the ability to use multiple removable media formats. Like most people, I have a camera that uses one type of media, a phone that uses another, etc. This can handle virtually anything out there. Works simply as expected. Using the included driver helps label the four media slots."
5,Great card reader,"Others have complained about the pins bending or other issues with the unit. I don't use this every day but when I do need it, it works well for me. No complaints."
5,McNeely Delivers Again with MARNIE,"After earlier triumphs, such as ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo"" and ""Citizen Kane,"" Joel McNeely and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra deliver another definitive digital recording from composer Bernard Herrmann. This recording is excellent and stands alongside their recording of ""Vertigo"" for sheer intensity and interpretation of Herrmann's scoring. The MARNIE theme is central to the score, but its variations as written by Herrmann, reveal the subtleties of the scenes played out by the characters on the screen. This recording reveals those subtleties so precisely and eloquently that you are able to recall the exact scenes from the film. The recording of this score has been long overdue, but it was worth the wait. I highly recommend it."
4,lots of action,steven seagal is a great martial arts actor. he may not have the speed of jet li but he does what he does well and these four movies are packed with action. you cant go wrong for the price. the fire down below is one of my favorite movies.
3,More than,"you ever wanted to know about polio and the zillion personalities involved. I found myself skipping ahead. Well done, but overly long , IMHO."
1,Wish I could give zero stars >:(,"Please, don't buy from this seller. I've sent e-mails to three different addresses trying to get an answer from them and have not heard back.First, the cartridge they sent was damaged upon arrival. A piece was broken off that allows the cartridge door to open when the printer is closed. Luckily, I still had my old cartridge and was able to switch the doors and have it physically working again.But the cartridge won't print correctly. After some research, I've found it's probably got a bad corona wire in it.The irony of it all is they include a card with the cartridge begging you to contact them rather than leave less than 5 stars.Never again."
1,Unusable,This cartridge leaves a vertical stripe on the pages. I thought maybe it would lessen over time but it didn't. The pages it prints are unusable.
3,Review of printer cartridge,"The cartridge was cheaper than buying from my local Staples store. However, it was still expensive. I haven't tried some non HP brands before, but they are more cost effective if they have the same quality. The quality of the print is excellent, but replacing all 4 cartridges is more expensive than buying a new printer."
1,Faded Red - Unacceptable,"After I put the new Magenta Cartridge into my printer, the reds looked faded on the test prints. I removed the cartridge, cleaned the area, gave the cartridge a good shake, and put it back into the printer. No change - still faded reds. I'm very disappointed. I purchased the HP cartridge specifically so this would not happen (after reading the reviews of cheaper re-manufactured units). Now I have to ask for and wait on a replacement ... if I can get one. Lesson learned - if you're going to pay full price anyway, buy from a local supplier."
3,Newer is better.,"Having a tape of If in their later ""dance floor "" sound and seeing them in 1974 in Daytona Beach,I was very interested in hearing this album. I think if you can find a copy of ""Tea break over,back on your heads"" you'll really hear the best of If.The later sound will remind you of a funky,much more jazzy and musicaly far superior AWB. I'm slightly disappointed."
4,INFORMATIVE!,great overview of the music box market & background of various machines & the makers who made them. Much detailed information ahve not seen before.
1,Do NOT buy this thing,"I didn't have any illusions of grandeur for a coffee warmer. I knew that at best, they can only maintain temperature. This product hardly gets warm to the touch and does nothing to keep a cup of anything even close to warm. Complete waste of money."
3,"A good value, but.....","...Cat's Eye is the standout feature and I don't really care for the other three. I bought it for Cat's Eye hoping that I might like one of the others. Still, I am reasonably satisfied as this was only a few dollars more than the Cat's Eye only dvd.If you are a fan of Creepshow as well as Cat's Eye it is worth the purchase. I think I would have walked out on Dreamcatcher if I saw it in theaters. And Delores Claiborne is a somber movie about abuse so it isn't quite what you might want in a Stephen King film.Cat's Eye is a trilogy of stories with dark humor and suspense. I think it is one of the quintesential 80s films and you can detect King's brand of humor and style throughout. It is a real gem.Creepshow seemed like five stories that kept hitting the same note. It has campy acting and the stories pretty much end the same: with a dead guy coming back for revenge or someone dying a gruesome death. Often both. But I can see how it might be an enjoyable cult film for some."
3,regular guitar,"I buy this guitar and the volume control no work and I have to replace the part. good construccion, the white protector no look new. low price for beginners."
2,Mermaid II,"I felt that the movie was ok. It seemed to have the same plot as the first one. I was disappointed to the point where if you have seen the first one, that is all you need to see.The characters were cute and funny but that is about it. It was not as realistic as the first one. When I left the theaters after watching the The Little Mermaid, I had felt that I was in the sea and that I could feel what Ariel was going through. Little Mermaid II just didn't give me the same feeling. Too bad, I had hoped for something more."
5,A Rare Disney Film,"This is a pleasant sequel to ""The Little Mermaid"", but when my wife and I talked about the film after watching it, we realized something: It ultimately shows a POSITIVE mother/daughter relationship.How many other Disney animated films show this? Actually, how many Disney animated films show a mother that is still ALIVE?Not many. Good for them, for finally showing this."
2,Mediocre,"Cotrary to what a previous reviewer thought, I do not recommend the lion king 2 as a good sequel, but neither is the little mermaid 2. Apart from the sloppy animation (eg king Triton's head growing peaked when he lifts it up, Ariel's elongation of the neck and apparent jaw deformity towards the end of the duet with her daughter, the oversizedness of her head in many frames), the songs seem very spiritless, especially in comparison with the stellar repertoire of the original.One thing which might prove slightly annoying to the viewer was the cliched political correctness of the ending song.There seemed to be a few shallow attempts at addressing 'issues', such as family values, sibling rivalry, etc, but these were lost in the disappointing script. Morgana fell sadly short of the expectations set up by Ursula, and came off looking more like a crazed old hag. As King Triton himself mentioned in the show, a 'madwoman'. What a force to be reckoned with."
4,Good for a sequel,Kept my daughter entertained. She was happy to see familiar characters and particularly liked the seagull. Can't get a copy of the Little Mermaid for a reasonable price (ours was eaten by the vcr). It's a decent sequel.
2,This is one of the cheesiest movies Disney has made,"Everyone has more sense in The Litte Mermaid 1.Scuttle is even dummer now,no one in real life speaks like grown-up Floumder does in this movie,and it's like the same movie with new and old people.all song's were cheesey like the movie, if someone call'sthis a masterpieac forget it it's a mastercheesy. basically disney did a REALLY BAD JOB on this movie."
2,"rent, don't buy","My kids liked it ok, but honestly, I wouldn't buy it. It isn't nearly as good as the original. I found the character, Melody, unlikeable. The animation was not that great."
1,sorry but i wish this video hadnt become part of my world,"im very sorry to do this but this video sucked! all the characters were different and ariel looked horrible, she didnt have the same face or anything i know shes meant to look older but come on! eric wasnt as cute and he was ugly which was weid coz when i was little i really fancied him.lol.the songs wernt as good i think that the moment song was ok but nothing can beat under the sea, kiss the girl and part of your world!!!! any way i think that disney ruin the first film by making a second (except toy story 2) like alladin return of jafar and lady and the tramp 2 this is mean!!! coz i really love little mermaid and still do but when i watch the orignal all i think of is the boring second one! anyway if you agree with me feel free to send me and e-mail CHARLIE@honey63.fsnet.co.uk and i can tell you a few mistakes i found in the movie and give you some cool pictures of disney films"
2,Ewww.,"Adults are antagonizingly bored, and even children don't like it. The songs are ill-written, the plotline sent from the doldrums, and the voices of characters who are not from the original film are stilted. The songs are overabundant and drawn out to painful lengths. To quote my three year old niece when we were watching the opening of the film: ""When are they gonna stop singing? I don't like this movie."" From the mouth of babes, eh?"
1,Never Got My Order!,I never received this order. My account was charged but it was never shipped. I emailed the sender and did not receive a response.Still working on either getting the item I ordered or my money back
2,Washed out.,"The story and music were moderately ok for my young ones. What amazed me was the washed out coloring and art work on my 46"" digital TV. Especially compared to other cartoon movies that I have on DVD. Story and music get 3 stars, art gets 1 star for an average of 2. Someone needs to start doing movies for kids besides Disney. Maybe they'll try harder."
3,Not bad for a sequel,"My daughter got this movie on VHS a couple of years ago, when she was four years old. She was totally into Ariel & the original movie at the time. She actually liked this movie better than the original, because the story is about a kid who wants to swim in the ocean, not a lovesick teenager. She could relate to it more. While it is clearly not as good as the original, if you have a Little Mermaid fan, they will enjoy this movie."
4,Preschooler loves this sequel,"This sequel to The Little Mermaid is colorful and whimsical. I wish there were a few more songs, though. My daughter, a Disney Princess fan through and through, enjoys it very much. Overall, the movie is entertaining but the remarks made by Morgana being criticized by her Mom while growing up are bothersome to me. These lines were unnecessary and of little relevance to the story, except to make the movie a downer for a few minutes.Although not perfect, Little Mermaid II was worth looking at, and most important, my little one enjoys it enough to replay it frequently."
3,movie is ok,the movie is ok. nothing like the first movie. but my 3year old daughter loves it so i can't complain.
3,Dont Buy the VHS yet!,"So, as I was watching the new Little Mermaid 3, Ariels beginning, I noticed that they are re-releasing this movie soon. If you want a new one in DVD format, just wait it out a bit!!"
1,Zero Stars is more like it!,"First of all I loved the original because it's a love story and follows the fairy tale tradition. This however is an insult to my taste and love for disney films! I'd rate Disney tied in creativity to Anime! I despise disney sequels;with one exception ""Toy Story 2""! Steer clear of this sham film! Sequel S stands for Sham, E stands for effortless ,Q stands for quick fix ,U stand for un-original ,E stands for economic hoax ,L stands for Lifeless! Conclusion avoid other titles ""Lady and the Tramp 2"" ""Lion King II Simba's Pride"" and ""Return of Jafar""!"
1,"If it was an option, no stars...","When I was a little girl I fell in love with the Little Mermaid, now, at seventeen I decided to check out the sequal, at least there should be good music, Right? Wrong.This movie is a pathetic attempt of Disney, while I liked the Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, Return to the Sea's characters are pathetic, it lacks all the romantic element the first one had and is replaced by a stupid child who can talk to animals, being the the only one in the kingdom who can, and not knowing she is a mermaid you'd think she suspect something, no?Even the music is nearly the exact same as in the first, and this gives a bad name to the Little Mermaid."
5,Harlem Girl Lost: A Novel,A must read! I couldn't put it down! I'm very critical of what I read and I can honestly say I have nothing but good to say about this book! Treasure Blue how will you top this! Wait I'm sure you'll find a way! Good work Great Man!
5,love this!,for his first novel he brings out every emotion in you possible! you dont know urban novels until u read harlem girl lost. i can go on and on about this but you should just read for yourself. promise you wont be disappointed..i know i wasnt!
5,must have,this book is the bomb it is a page turner. i read it in one day.everybody that loves to read you must get this one it will have you going all the way to last page.
1,Not safe,"Not only does this item have the toy bars at head/eye level making it likely that your child will hit there head on it, I've noticed that one of the height adjustment knobs for the bouncer pad doesn't lock in place. Seeing it, I'm worried that if my daughter bounces too hard, she's going to knock the pad out of its place, misbalance and hurt herself. Save your money. Don't waste it on this item."
2,"random, rote list not a good way to learn","Hungry for Korean listening materials, I bought level 2 of this 3-level set. It is boring and pointless to listen to an endless list of words uttered first in English, then in Korean. Worse for Korean learners of English is the random inclusion of articles ""the"" and ""an"" before nouns. I suppose the purpose is to distinguish nouns that take ""a"" and nouns that take ""an,"" but ""the curiosity"" is unnatural because this countable noun would need the article ""the"" only if modified by an adjective clause as in ""the curiosity that children show..."" The ""a/an"" distinction is easy to learn. It would make more sense to distinguish clearly between countable and uncountable nouns by using ""a"" before countable nouns and nothing before uncountable nouns.A companion CD to a textbook would reinforce language learned in the context of a thematic unit, but a random list is not a useful tool for increasing vocabulary.I will not buy any more Vocabulearn CDs."
1,Yuck,"This rates up there with all the other disgusting tasting protein powders. Plus whenever I use it as a shake for some reason my body can't digest and/or process it well because it gives me a wicked stomach ache I feel like crap for about an hour straight. However when I bake with it I don't have this problem. It's not that great to bake with as waffles, muffins etc blow up and get huge and then when removed from oven they deflate obviously because it's egg white powder. Vega chocolate protein powder is by far the best tasting shake I've tried so far although it isn't perfection either it's pretty darn close!!"
1,Definitely NOT the best tasting protein powder on the planet!,"If you are looking for a product that is all ""natural"" then this is probably the closest you will get to it. I was really excited to try this protein since I began following the Paleo diet, but I was greatly disappointed. I can't quite pin point what it is exactly that makes this protein so gross, but I just couldn't do it. After one sip, I gagged and had to put it away. I've tried my fair share of proteins, and I am usually pretty good at just powering through them, but this one was just too gross.I'm not super excited about sticking with my current protein because it has a very small amount of sucralose in it, but it's a small price to pay for a protein I can drink warm or cold and at my leisure.Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound"
1,"Tastes very, very bad","I have purchased most all flavors of Jay Robb Whey Protein, and those are all very tasty - excellent in fact. The Egg Protein, however, is a different story. This protein powder is inedible as far as I am concerned.Very unpleasant to drink anything made with this product. If you can use whey, I would definitely recommend the Jay Robb Vanilla Whey instead, as well as any of the other whey flavors."
4,Alright Stuff,"I purchased this as whey wreaks havoc on my gut..I got the 12oz package from another store for like $23 so the Amazon price is pretty good and will be buying from here next go round.I mix with 10oz plain water and the stevia aftertaste is noticeable but not too bad. The vanilla taste is there and turns the water dull yellow..kinda looks egg whites with a touch of yolk..like custard almost.Ive tasted lots of ""whole,nutritious"" powders and the taste isnt that bad to me. On a scale of 1-10, 1 tasting like horse s*** and 10 being the most delicious ever, its a 3.5-4. Not the best but I need protein not some fruity kool-aid drink..It mixes well with just a spoon. Lots of protein, 24 grams per serving.Doesnt upset my stomach or anything so I'm quite pleased. Would've given 5 stars if it tasted as good as whey powders."
5,Fun CD for Voice Training,"Yes, you can find much more extensive and detailed programs for voice training, but considering that this is only one CD - it is very good and enjoyable to work with. It will liberate your voice and you'll have fun singing along.The CD consists of 8 songs for training different aspects of your voice. They are recorded once with singers and then the same songs are provided as instrumentals."
2,bad craftsmanship,"I got one at Bed Bath and Beyond and the legs were put together backwards, so when I put it together the wheels didn't sit on the ground correctly. I traded it in and on the replacement one of the legs was right but the other was backwards. So I do not have much faith in the manufacturor and will be getting a different product."
3,not what i expected,"Didn't notice that it was a 2001 edition. Big mistake. I am sure the values have changed by now, either up or down"
1,Waste of Money & Time,This product is worthless!! I tried it on my Fig plants to keep the mocking birds away. I could see the birds several feet away looking at the power wing and enjoying my Figs. The folks at Lentek did not back up the product. It may make a good office paper weight!
1,Doesn't Work,I have a problem with birds pecking holes into the side of my house to nest. I have one hung under an eave and the birds totally ignore this thing. It is totally ineffective. Don't waste your money on this gimmick.
3,basic rap/funk metal,"the cd is fun to listen to ill admit-its because of songs like ""fled"" and ""mannequin"" that made me buy this album.but it tends to lose its focus after a couple of spins.when they try to be melodic,they fail and fail miserably.when they rock hard and trow in some punk/funk they kick ... its a hit or miss cd,if you have an extra 10 bucks,sure why not otherwise go get albums by reach 454 or shinedown"
2,Die already,"Nu-metal is a genre that I seriously thought was about to die out, but it seems to keep hanging on like that cat in the poster. I kept hearing Twisted Method was better than the average nu-metal band, so I checked them out. What I found was something I think sounds like what you would get if Fred Durst wrote the lyrics for a Slipknot album. On some of the songs you can just tell that the singer is trying to copy Corey Taylor, right down to his inflection. Two or three of the songs have a more melodic side, but the lyrics are just crap. And this is coming from someone who thought the last Dope album was fairly good. There are some good nu-metal bands out there, I for one am a huge fan of Memento. Twisted Method, however, is not one of these bands."
1,oh my...,"These guys are horrible. Their lyrics consist of this ""f*ck f*ck f*ck youuu"" and ""sh*t, sh*t sh*t,"" Their guitar parts are absolutely cheesy, their vocals sound like the Nick Carter meets some crappy screamer. Please listen to me when I say, don't buy this cd. If you must listen to hardcore..try out between the buried and me, alexisonfire, through the eyes of the dead, or WHATEVER, just do not buy this album and give these awful musicians your money."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because I got a two-track promo that was seriously rocking. Those two songs are the first two on the CD: ""The End"" and ""Fled."" Unfortunately, when I put in the full-length CD, only those first two songs (and the third one) were any good. After that, the band falls into a boring R&B-meets-Linkin Park drone that lasts most of the rest of the album. Even the few parts that poke their head out of that muck aren't enough to make you forget when you just heard and/or be optimistic about what's coming up. But those first three tracks...super-aggressive, super-pissed, and very loud and offensive. If you (like a lot of the people under this review) like the combo of heavy/aggressive and melodic/R&B-based metal (duwah?) then you'll dig this, but if you prefer just the loud, dumb, and aggressive, stay away from this."
5,Twisted Method: the greatest ever,"When I first heard this band I was blown away. I recomended this to my friend but he didn't really like it. I didn't know exactly why. I told him this was the best band I had ever heard. He started listening to them and he started liking them. That just goes to show you that, you don't know what you like until you try it. I'll give this five stars because it is great. If you havn't listened to them you really need to. you will love it, I promise."
4,Good Lenten Reading!,We are doing a Lenten study using this book. The short chapters are easy to read and very thought provoking. I was especially glad it came in large print for a friend of mine who has trouble with her eyes. We have enjoyed it very much. The questions are better for those who have not really studied their faith in depth. I like the scripture study and references the best. Thanks Max!
5,Undoubltably one of PA's finest and one Sci-Fi's finest,"So much to say. The characters are not just deep but convoluted with a complexity that would make fine subject matter for a novel unto itself. That is only the beginning of this book however, the Macroscope is a fantastic invention of PA's imagination and the none of the socio-political implications that such a device would have on society are missed in PA's treatment of it. As the book winds forward we experience a many different adventures each of which are complete stories themselves. The book has a refreshingly scientific treatment of inter-galactic space travel and the problems involved with it. All around one of my favorite books of all time."
2,Don't Buy This!,"The Kindle version of this book is awful. It appears that no one read what they were posting for us to buy. The paragraphs end in the middle of a word, dialog just runs within the same paragraph. It makes for a difficult read.Someone needs to edit the books they release.Just because it's a Kindle book doesn't mean the we should settle for crap. I read the paperback twenty years ago and the novel itself is quite good.Wait for them to properly re-edit the Kindle version before you buy this or read the paperback from your library."
3,Macroscope,"This is early Piers Anthony--back in the 1960's when he was still an adult. It's well worth reading. Ok, it's a little tedious in parts, and told me a lot more about astrology than I cared to learn, but the plot is terrific, as is the character development. It reminded me of some of Orsen Scott Card's better work."
5,Great hair dye!,"I've been dying my hair odd colors for a long time, and this stuff works just as well or better than anything i've found in a salon, and comes out exactly like the color in the pictures. If you don't mind dying your hair yourself, great buy!"
5,"I love ""Miss Bindergarten""","I started my boys kindergarten year with ""Miss Bindergarten Gets Ready For Kindergarten"", and we liked it so much we bought all the other ""Miss Bindergarten books. They are all very age-appropriate, funny, engaging, and have great illustrations. And if you like one, you'll like them all."
2,Disappointing,"Recipes are intricate, difficult and call for ingredients that are not ""on hand"" for the average person, especially a working family."
3,Better than their previous...but not much.,"This CD at least sounds like it had more thought and effort behind it than Black Light Syndrome. It is a better engineered and recorded album, and the music sounds much more refined rather than the hurried rushed tracks of the former. Still I would expect more from these 3.And once again, any one expecting something to the effect of Liquid Tension Experiment...as these 3 have been compared to....forget it. You'll be disappointed if you like LTE."
3,My Cookies Stuck Big Time,"Although reviews on various sites gave these baking sheets great reviews, I found their non-stick properties to be non-existent. I had to go back to the store and purchase Silpat baking liners to be able to use these to extract my cookies from the sheets. I should have just bought cheap ones and bought the Silpat sheets and saved myself money and exasperation."
3,nothing special,I have had them for close to a year and honestly Calphalon bakeware and the pans I have from them are a big disappointment.
1,Disappointing cheapness from Calphalon,These cookie sheets are so thin and cheap you might as well use tin foil. Was very surprised to find this was a Calphalon product.
2,Predigested Platitudes,Occasional insights obscured by thickets of doctrinaire Freudianism. Let the reader beware!
4,Good Read - Very Interesting Alternate Earth,"Another solid story and set of characters from Mr. Reynolds, and well worth your time if you are a fan.If you have not read Alastair Reynolds yet, I would recommend PUSHING ICE first and then this book; together the two will give you a good feel for the strengths...and weaknesses of his writing.Strengths of CENTURY RAIN:1. Story is engaging, main characters are well-developed2. Just the right amount of technology and scientific reality3. No deux ex machina solution4. Fascinating settings that leave you wanting to read more about them5. Secondary characters are interesting in their own rightWeaknesses of CENTURY RAIN:1. Ending is a bit too neatly tied up in parts2. The key to the mystery was fairly obvious about 3/4 of the way throughThus, I score it a high 4, not a 5, but more than enough to keep me waiting for the next novel by Reynolds."
2,Failed marriage,"Reynolds attempts to blend hard-boiled detective fiction with science fiction and does not come up with a very good book. I put it aside after reading somewhat more than half. I shan't finish, as, by any measure ""Century Rain"" is poorly written: the plot is predictable; the characters poorly drawn; and the dialogue leaden. I recommend choosing another book by Reynolds."
5,xmas gift,we re did my daughters room and the comforter set i bought at walmart didnt come with a sham..thankfully this was sold separately i love it matches to a T
2,Who needs the strain,Eating disorders are indeed an element of this book. The stress/obsesion with food is constant. I'm not sure if reading / feeling someone elses stress or unhealthy relationship with food will help one establish a healthy relationship of their own.Perhaps it would be insightful to someone unaware of how food/weight can cause stress. But who doesn't know that already.
5,Good,Massive was a very touching story. I was very happy that i found it. And it made me not want to do other things i always wanted to read. And it was an easy read
1,disappointed,there are two versions of this movie - one is edited and one is not - do not buy the edited one - it is not worth it.
1,"Yes, I was duped with the editing too",I was fully expecting to replace my VHS tape from the 70's. Our cult following this movie was severely disappointed to find it was edited and still contained the R rating.
3,Works as advertised,"setup was a bit difficult, and when you change the batteries, all memory is lost. complicated to set up with any non sony devise, but it has a good range i use it about 8 feet away with no prob. wouldnt recommend unless youre using a sony tv and dvd player or home theater, it will automatically recognize them, otherwise for a few bucks more logitec makes a much simpler remote with better features and a better look"
5,"A good note on this ""Notebook""","If you are a Partridge Family hardcord fan you will not be dissapointed with this re-masted reissue of this time capsule. Not only do you get the best sound quality in this package, your getting the UK art work release for its front cover, and more linner notes than the original release! You will be more than ""Happy' with this release in your collection."
1,Save Your Money,A pathetic effort to squeeze some more money out of Guns and Roses fans. Don't get duped.
4,Its OK for the price,The Product look OK for presentatións. A little piseled in dark shadows for movies because the color resolution but for me its ok. You don't have to convert a movie from avi to mpg to burn a DVD movie.
4,fun date night movies,these were a fun batch of movies to watch with a date and a bag of popcorn. Great fun. Will watch again.
4,operated fine,"This worked well as a product, but my Buick Rendezvous just wasn't designed for it. I didn't want to blind other drivers so I took it out. I have since purchased a different vehicle and it has HID's so I sold these to someone else. They do work well as far as HID conversion kits go."
4,very good,is nice to listen to the songs you fell in love with! ....in easy listening....instrumental...i think MR Tony Hatch did a very good job!
1,This is volume 2 of the set.,"I received this item and after seeing it was volume 2 I ordered the other NABU PRESS offering (ISBN 9781177376808) assuming it to bevolume 1 of the set. Imagine my surprise when the actual text for the second item was the same. This print-on-demand publisher did manage to find a different copy of v. 2 to duplicate, but the result is the same: two copies of v 2 of Heitman's ""Historical register and dictionary...."" offered with different ISBNs. Perhaps Amazon should revise the product descriptions to specift the vol. number."
2,Picture not quite accurate,Again a problem with my order because of the picture quality. I purchased this for my daughter based on the color of blue and white.There is no white in this watch. It is a very masculine dark navy blue and dark grey coloring. I'm going to give it to her and let her decide if she wants to return it or not. I learned my lesson NOT to purchase watches without seeing in person.
3,"Flawed, but nonetheless enjoyable.","I really liked this book. It is a good entry into the growing genre of the ""Martial arts thriller"". I like the main character Bobby Samuels. I love the action and the story line. My only gripe is that some of the dialogue is a bit drawn out and unrealistic. An example of this is the joke about the little girl with the puppy. I also thought that the demise of the villian was anticlimactic. Other then that, the book is a good read and I look forward to the next entry in the series."
2,Very Long Loading Time....,"This game has entertained my 11 and 6 year old for two days, but I have to say, it is not amoung the greats. The game is simple to play, and beat, but the loading times are excessively long, especially since the graphics are not that wonderful. The end result is you get to have parts in a movie that is being filmed, and the person with the most popularity points gets to be the supervillain in the end of the movie. It is slightly confusing because they play the clips out of order as you beat the levels, but my biggest complaint is the loading time...everything has to load...everything."
2,Lasts less than a YEAR...,This initially was a great product and I loved it for many months. After 6 months the screen on the unit began to malfunction and there was no image coming thru. I replaced the handheld. In less than a year the screen did the same thing plus the screen stopped working altogether. I have two friends who also have the monitor and they have also had problems with the screen. The company will only replace it within a year of purchase. (why only within a year...becasue it will stop working after a while).I find there are so many other models out there and hopefully one that will last thru more than a baby's first year.I Do not recommend it at all.
2,BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS!!,"I've had my monitor for 6 months and have used it for probably 4 and yesterday it completely died. It's never been the best monitor- static, only 2 channels, pointless ""color"" - but I've dealt with it until now. A few days ago I plugged it into the wall to recharge it and it made a crazy fuzzy noise and wouldn't turn on if it was plugged in. It got so bad that I could only turn it on every now and then and only see my baby for about 3 seconds before the screen went black. Finally today it completely died. I would not recommend this product. And I never believe the bad reviews! Baby monitors are supposed to last for more than 4 months. This is ridiculous. Maybe some of them are just flukes, but what if yours is the fluke? Just don't throw away the box or your receipt if you're brave enough to purchase this!"
2,Picked up neighborhood cribs,"I purchased this from another vendor this past weekend and will be returning it. We live in a very dense subdivision (townhouses, etc) and I was able to view 3 other cribs from the neighborhood...including sound from one of them. I'm not at all comfortable with the fact that if I can see them...anyone can/would surely be able to see into our home as well.I was hoping that we wouldn't have the problems with the interference, because it is a very nice design, video had good quality and a decent price."
2,I've already returned it.,"The audio static from this monitor made it impossible for me to sleep. Most of the time the audio and video reception were fine, but about once every two minutes a loud static would broadcast making it impossible to fall or stay asleep. By the second week of this of this, I was too jelous to watch my son sleeping perfectly soundly on the monitor while I was kept wide awake!"
1,Old model was better,This monitor is not great. We had the older model and you could move the camera around to see different angles of the crib. On this one you cant!! So annoying. We returned it.
4,It's a mom-monitor too!,"My wife and I are the caregivers for my 98-year-old mother who lives alone three floors below our 12th floor condo unit. We needed a way to periodically check on her both day and night as although she has very limited mobility, she still has the ability to move enough to fall from her bed or a chair. The Summer Infant Day and Night Monitor has been the perfect solution as the images and the sound reproduction the camera provides to the handheld monitor in a solid concrete building have been clear either in full daylight or total darkness."
3,ok,the picture quality for the size. I would prefer to get the same brand jsut the one with the lcd screen. Infact recently purchased one and tell ya what we use both!!!
3,Lasted 1 Year!,"We got the monitor as a shower gift. It worked well for the first 9 months, but after that the volume didn't work all of the time. Some times in the middle of the night it would go silent and we would not hear our son crying. I gave it three stars because the video quality is pretty good and it worked really well at first. Today we broke down and ordered a new one through woot.com so I hope the new one is better and last a little longer. I love having the video on it to see why he is crying and to know if he needs me or not - this is how we got our son to sleep through the night."
3,"Great, until it dies","We had this item for a year and it worked great. We would get static, but it wasn't too bad. The picture quality was good day and night, all in all, it met our needs. Then, three nights ago, the screen image on the handheld started going in and out. The following night it was completely gone. I know about changing the channel, we tried that. It's not that, the image just isn't there. Thank goodness when we bought the monitor we also bought the 15 month protection plan and are able to get our money back. This is a fine, easy to use product, but make sure you have some sort of warranty or something on it."
2,"Great video, but terrible sound","If all you are looking for is a great color/night vision video monitor, this is your device. However, if you want to be able to listen in on your baby as well, this is not the way to go. I was very excited to have this monitor until I plugged it in. I have tried to use it in my home, my parent's home, and now our new home in another city and in all three places the video worked great, but the sound mechanism put out a very loud static that prevented us from ever hearing the baby (yes, I tried it on both the A and B channels in all locations). Friends of ours who also have this same device have the same issue. We think that maybe the wifi we have in our homes could be interfering with the sound mechanism, but for $135+ that should not be an issue. I have not used other video monitors, so maybe they are all like this, but I would not buy this for or recommend it to any friends or family members."
4,Great Monitor,"This is a nice monitor. It is really nice being able to see your little one instead of relying strictly on noise. Being able to see will prevent you from going into baby's room when not necessary. I also like the idea of adding another camera to monitor a second room which I plan to do for my 4 year old. The time out feature is really nice too and a must have for the night time monitoring. Easy to use, easy to set up and works great. The only negative I have so far is the picture is not the best but the baby's room is dark, even in the day. Even with that, the picture is enough to see when he is awake and needs me."
1,Will keep you awake more than the baby!!!!!!!,"I always listen to what other mothers have to say in their reviews, it always helps. I thought I should give back and give you a heads up on this monitor. I have this monitor and it cracks and makes all kinds of crazy sounds. It has kept us up more than the baby. At first I thought it was just mine but, my girlfriends had the same problem. I gave it one star because I do recommend a monitor with the screen, it really helps!"
2,Range of reception great if you never leave the room!!,"As we plugged it in and saw the first images we were amazed. This will be great for monitoring our baby......until we walked out of the room.By stepping through the threshold of the baby room, we lost picture and had tons of static interference, even after trying both channels. We needed to immediately return the device.As a monitor for freely monitoring your baby, I could not reccomend this product.The main reason for going with this model was becouse of the 900mhz frequency which was not supposed to be affected by the wireless internet we have. It just lacks in reception capabilities altogether."
3,baby monitor,"This is a fine item,unfortunatley it picked up the neighbors signal as well as the babys romm. We had to replace it with the newer digital model that the company rep said would not pick up or allow others to pick up your camera."
3,good but could be much better,"I have had this for over a year now and love being able to watch my daughter down the hall. Unfortunately when I bought this it was $180 and I dont think it is worth it. You need a regular sound monitor in addition since this one creates really bad static. So, I like the other features of this monitor, but for the money it should be able to have clear sound like my generic $30 Evenflo monitor. My mother and best friend also have this same unit and we all have the same problem with static, doesnt matter how far away. For the next baby I will try something new, maybe with color!"
3,"Good monitor, static chriping keeps me up at night","This is a pretty good monitor for the price. The picture quality is good and if you are within 1, maybe 2 rooms of the camera unit it works really well. The microphone cuts off but when there is a sound in the room it senses the sound and turns back on. I've never had a problem with not hearing my baby. My baby's room is on the other side of the house (2 rooms + bathroom away from my bedroom), so it's just at the point at night where it gets great reception except for this constant static ""chirping."" It has these little static blips all night that are pretty annoying...In conclusion, good product, but spend the extra money and buy a DIGITAL (this one's analog) video monitor system if you have a wireless connection in your house."
2,"Nice concept, poor execution","It's a great concept to have video monitoring of your baby, but I had to return this unit due to the following problems:1)Very bad reception...being even 30-50 feet away (and our house is only 15 years old) the reception turned snowy2)Only 2 channels...so very likely it's going to receive interference from phones/WIFI/neighbor/etc. If you've ever seen normal baby monitors or cordless phones, there are dozens if not hundreds of channels.3)The video camera itself is extremely light...so when you aim/tilt the camera forward, it falls over! You'll need to put a rock or other weight to keep it from doing a summersault off the table/nightstand/shelf.#1 and #2 are what really got to me. We live in a world of cordless phones, WIFI, and all sorts of other things that may interfere with each other. This unit really should have had better reception planned into the design.However, when it did work, it was very handy! The night vision was great!"
2,Stopped working after 1.5 years.,"Was quite happy with the unit until it broke after only 1.5 years of use. Most people use the same monitor for multiple children, we'll be needing multiple monitors for one child."
1,Don't get this,"This monitor is great if you're in close range, but if you get a room apart from it, it starts to have static. You're losing enough sleep because of the newborn, you don't need a monitor keeping you up because of the static as well."
3,Works great for a while,"This monitor is great for the first few months. Don't count on seeing full color. The night vision isn't bad though, and the sound quality is good. The only problem I have is that it didn't last very long. The place on the hand-held where you plug in the adapter became loose and I practically have to tape it in there or it will move and the power goes out, which is not good in the middle of the night if you want to hear your baby! It also picks up weird interference, if you are near the hand-held and you move a certain way it makes this strange pulsing static noise."
2,Not that great,"Once I received the product as new (first time I was sent a used one even though I paid for new), I experienced more issues with it than the used-sold-as-new version. There was a consistent delay of 10 - 20 seconds before the sound kicked in whenever I turned on the monitor. Also, the picture, while on battery mode, cut out way too much--the monitor wasn't even that far away from the camera albeit on a different floor. If I lived in some spacious house instead of a small townhouse, I wouldn't have thought the problem was with the monitor itself. Sadly, it was. Also, forget about using the monitor without the AC adapter unless you want the annoying headache of listening to static half the time. On the plus side, the picture quality was pretty good, even in the dark. And, when the sound was available, I could hear every utterance from my twins. Still, those two things were not enough for me to keep this model."
2,Good Product Bad Adaptor,"The adaptor for the camera broken just in 1 week of use. Product itself works very good, but i have to pay extra just to get the adaptor fixed."
4,Video monitor is SOOO much better than an audio monitor,"Being able to SEE your baby is SOOOO much better than just hearing (you can see if your baby is on his/her stomach, etc.). Set up is very easy - just position the camera, plug it in and you're good to go! The downside - it becomes much more addictive than the audio monitor - you find yourself constantly watching your baby on the monitor. Oh no - his pacifier just fell out (but no crying). Should I go do something??? I would highly recommend this product!!!"
1,stick with black and white,there is actually no need to see your baby in color. The color works only when there is a bright light coming into the window. So save yourself a few dollars and stick with black and white.This unit does not have any security so i usually gets distraction from other units around the area.
2,Color is quite light,"Not a true dark red as in the photo, more of a dusty rose, or pink. High quality hat, however."
1,missing piece,"did the outline first in about an hour and there was a piece missing, very pissed off. The only puzzle I was angry over, and of course if it is opened you cant return them"
4,An informative book,"I found this book a fascinating, especially for a required college textbook. In his introductary chapter, he is redundant and tries to give the air the Native American religions are much more full of meaning than Western European religions. I was glad to see the rest of the book didn't make such ethnocentric and blanketed statements.The rest of the book is a quick overview of Native American religion. It explains in a very easy manner about the way they live and the differences in their cultures, and provides various examples and humorous stories to demonstrate Brown's findings.In closing, I think this book is a must have for any anthropologist."
1,scked,this came broken. wasnt worth the money. dont ge it. yours will most likely come broken too. so dont get happy
1,Does not meet tech specifications,"The unit does not provide a clean video feed per NTSC specifications when measured on a waveform monitor. The brightest video areas (white levels above 80 IRE units) were clipped/compressed.Can't tell if this is an inadvertent double termination of the RGB signals looping through the device or something else. I did check to insure that all connections were according to instructions, and no joy. A device advertised as ""Plug-n-play"" should just work, and the tech details regarding proper hookup and use should not be ambiguous. Not recommended.I went with the Grandtec device - decent video measured on the waveform monitor; more foolproof, looping RGB connector cable, and it just worked right out of the box."
4,Kevin Martin of Candlebox,"""Thoughtless Innuendos"" - One of the best songs I've heard in a long while. A great track by the singer of Candlebox. Check it out!"
2,Bad intonation,"Ms. Jo is a FABULOUS coloratura...truly inpeccable. But this? This is NOT quality...she shows terrible intonation (out of key) and her tonality is really not anything special, nor is it worth listening to more than once. I am a great fan of Sumi, and I truly enjoy most of her work...but this is perhaps a side of her voice best kept ""low profile,"" for it displays very little talent.My voice teacher told me that to be a coloratura someday, I would have to practically ""live"" in the upper register...well, I can see what she meant...it seems that most coloraturas to not have much of anything else!~"
5,Camoflouge,"Grandson loved it, it fit well, was made well and combined with the whole outfit , he couldnt wait to show off to his friends."
4,"Good Air Quality Primer, Seconded","The review I was going to write is almost exactly like the first review posted giving it 4 stars, so I will just second everything mentioned. Good air quality primer for the environmental professional, but if you are already an air quality scientist or specialist, you may find it a little basic. Excellent overall quality and information on all the air quality issues affecting North America today."
3,Problematic Plastic Handle,"So this has a plastic handle and does not even have a one piece head. It will be prone to getting raw meat juices in the seams on the head and handle. The head is also small for a tenderizer. I would have given it less stars, but I guess it is what it says. Spend a couple bucks more for a one piece aluminum. I will probably either toss mine or send it back."
2,Doesn't last long enough,"The bubbly did not last long enough. As a matter of fact, the Incredible Hulk, Strawberry Shortcake etc for a little over a dollar that I bought at Walmart lasted alot longer bubblewise than this did."
4,Lightweight,"This is a nice light weight skillet especially for the price. I was hoping that the lid from my Pampered Chef set would fit, but it doesn't. The glass lid does sit on the skillet to form a seal though, so it serves the purpose."
4,Saget's Folly,"If you want a movie satire that isnt family fare, this is it! If you expecting a cute penguin movie like Happy Feet, this aint it! and If you are expecting a cute Bob Saget (from the show FULL HOUSE) film, this is not it!This film pokes both fingers of fun at the Oscar Winning doctumentary March of the Penguins. Bob Saget said in the film documentary also on the disk, ""I started to adlib dialog to the movie, as I was watching it"". This film feels like that adlibbing in a more scripted and tighter form.Samuel Jackson does his best channeling of Morgan Freeman's narration in this film. Writer/director Saget surrounded himself with the voice talent of Lewis Black, Christina Applegate, 30 Rock's Tracy Morgan, and most of the Full House TV cast (Jodi Sweetin, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, and ER's John Stamos) whop seem to have fun doing this movie.It is light hearted, sexual romp using stock penguin footage. Those who like the Aristocrats, will LOVE this!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,I think a little context is needed.,"It might be best to see March of the Penguins first. Then you will enjoy Farce. Other wise it's just a movie with penguins talking dirty. It is a good satire on the original. Definately adult. It won't scar your little ankle biters but put them to bed. Then you can laugh a little less self consciously. The penguins talk, Carl, Jimmy & Marcus played by the voices of Bob Saget, Lewis Black & Tracy Morgan. Samuel Jackson does the Morgan Freeman part, the narration. A dozen other voices that you'll recognize. It covers the penguin life cycle. The endless marching, eating, marching, mating & birth of the next generation & again marching. Profanity laced jokes abound on food, sore feet, sex, the meaning of life, love etc. Bob Saget is breaking out of his mold of sugary sweet sit-com star & game host. Sometimes junvenile, many the jokes are straight out of the Yiddish joke telling tradition of bitching about life in general. Truly funny."
1,Painfully not funny.,This was painful. I could only tolerate about 20 minutes before I completely gave up on this DVD. Rather than paying to purchase this movie I would have paid $10 not to have wasted my time.Not funny. Not intelligent. Bad video quality. Painfully boring dialog. This is an embarrassment to all the 'stars' that contributed. It will make me very wary the next time I see the names Samuel Jackson and Christina Applegate on a DVD cover.
1,Not Even Worth Picking Up At The Video Store,"I am a college student, I love stupid and crude humor, but this movie was just a waste of time. I figured it could be good for a quick laugh, but man was I wrong. I had to get baked out of my mind just to tolerate watching it, and I still only laughed once. The humor is so juvenile (grade school level) yet the movie was marketed towards the young adult demographic. I would rather put a nail through my bean bags than watch this trash again."
4,Farce of the Penguins,The movie was cute but not as funny as I hoped it would be. The disk arrived in good condition and played perfectly.
3,Newer Edition is out,I purchased this book only to find out that there is a later updated edition available from the publisher. Which is just released in September 1998. So do not buy this book but the later edition which consist out of two volumes.
2,Complete Waste of Time!!!!!!,This book is of absolutely no use to anyone looking to actually LEARN something. CD was even more useless -- shouldn't have even bothered taking up space.
2,De ja vouz,"In the far future, , only genetically engineered humans are allowed to exist. They are concieved and carried outside their mothers, then they are divided into classes according to their genetic characteristics. Thus, their education, type of work, and future mates are all determined by the state.The dominant class of immortals (Optimen), who are supposed to be guiding the human race, are instead abusing their power, and limiting human reproduction and mixing. As a result, several underground movements collaborate to overthrow the optimen (Brave New World, anyone??).This novel feels like a sequel Huxley might have written. It lacks originality, new ideas and has no surprises. It is to be read only when one has read all the good ones."
4,"At last, the ULTIMATE lost tale has FINALLY been told","I was so excited to finally read the tale of the Tomed Incident. I had always thought that Tomed was a planet, not a starship.As I read, it didn't really make sense what the final plan was until much, much later into the book. Why steal a Romulan starship? It didn't make any sense to me. The Federation ALREADY has a cloaking device why get another. Then the pieces started to fall into place. With the desstruction of the Tomed, I actually dropped my jaw on the amount of devistation. Without giving away the twists, it was an enjoyable book (a bit slow in the middle for me, though). I do recommend it to people fond of historical Star Trek tales. It is NOT a Next Generation perfect world book. It is much darker than that, so HUGE fans of Next Generation please be aware: You may not like this book."
2,A moral vacuum as vast as space itself,"No doubt this is a well-crafted Star Trek novel, involving and suprising, which brings together characters old and new to provide the ""untold"" story of an episode referred to in the Next Generation series. All this work was spoiled for me by a resolution that both strains credulity and turns the stomach. I'm a big fan of ""dark"" Star Trek -- but this story portrays Starfleet characters commiting horrible, immoral, blatantly criminal actions after meticulous planning involving the manipulation of literally thousands of sentient lives. I like a story that forces characters to question the morality of their own actions; there was none of that here. When the ""twist"" was finally revealed, I found myself cringing in shame that I was previously rooting for these people. I think the putative bad guys deserve more admiration -- at least their actions reflect their stated principles."
5,Awesome trilogy,"Cary Bybee's ""The Last Gentile Trilogy"" is a must-read for anyone remotely interested in end times, Revelations-based fiction. The story is well-written and the characters are so real, identifiable, and believable. I found myself not being able to put the books down because of so much going on. The story line has something for everyone...action, suspense, drama, romance, and even comedy. The scientific approach to much of the subject matter is very refreshing as well. The way Mr. Bybee interprets end time phenomena through science is very impressive and well thought out. I've also read the entire ""Left Behind"" series and, in my opinion, Mr. Bybee's trilogy is much better. It moves along at a quicker pace and is not drawn out over 12 different books. Do yourself a big favor and pick up this trilogy: you will not be disappointed."
5,"anything ;he sings is great, he shows such feeliings","this is a star that puts feelings in all his songs, and if he feels it will not be good and describe how he feels, then he does not record. He lives a life of love and it shows in his music, he now has a new baby and a wife with his grown daughter, what a great combination, and he is sure easy on the eyes."
4,Pretty Good,"Plenty of everything in this show. Lots of swearing, so probably not something you want to show the kids. If your college age though- it's awesome!"
1,"Dunce, it doesn't learn.",I got the remote and quickly did a code search for all my components. Then I tried the functions provided and found that only half of them worked. (I could scroll Up and Right in my TV's menu but not Down or Left). Then I tried fixing the commands that didn't work and add the ones that were missing. I did get a couple of commands learned but 99% of them refused to be learned making this remote an expensive paper weight.
3,"Nice start tolearn,but difficult to hear exact pronunciation","It was very hard to distinguish between the words starting with an ""h"" and ""p"". In addition, the words ending in ""s"" or ""ch"" were also difficult to determine. I found myself trying to convert the armenian alphabet to english phonetics just in order to pronounce the words correctly. There is no formality or streamlined thinking to this program. They give you a very short list of the alphabet and a few rules and that is basically it. The tapes consist of vocabulary words spit at you in no random order or grouping. Perhaps a workbook breaking the language down to groupings of pronouns, seasons, months of year etc. would be a more beneficial way in addition to the tapes to learn this language."
3,A Good Book To Know About Nutrition,"I bought this book for a class and it shows pretty thouroughly everything you want to know about nutrition. It seems to talk a lot about nutrition fads, and how quick fixes in nutrition to lose weight, gain muscle don't add up too much. It is pretty much by the book on everything. The main message I'll make is that this a book to read if you are wondering about your nutrition habits. It gives sufficient information on nutrition, recommended to all because it is easy to read."
2,A Little Dated- I'd Go for the More Recent Shalom Sesame DVDs,"I bought this DVD for my congregation's library. I watched most of it and felt it was probably too dated to relate to today's children. But I love the concept of Shalom Sesame! If I had to do it over again I would have bought the more recent Shalom Sesame DVDs. As far as cost/shipping etc, I have no complaints :)"
3,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Shawn Mullins is underrated, but nevertheless this is not his best performance. He sounds good with an acoustic guitar and his storytelling songs, but after a while it just starts putting you to sleep."
1,Didn't Work for Me,Looks like I'm in the minority here. Clunky and inelegant prose and way too wordy. Add in an annoying font style and the story establishes no rhythm. The author's attempts at wit and creativity land flat. A definite thumbs-down.
3,Adequate,"This thermometer is accurate in some temperature ranges, and not accurate in others. I base this on comparing it with three other thermometers, including another Taylor brand. It seems to be inaccurate between 60-80 degrees Farenheit, but accurate at 90-100. Also, I find it hard to read, since the increments have large marks between the numbers and small ones at the numbers. I would have liked the increment indicators to be the same length. I'll keep it, since the price was right, and it looks good. But readings are plus or minus three or four degrees, generally."
1,I have GOT to stop buying this woman's books,"I keep buying Bertrice Small's books because I am trying to find the same magic that was in Skye O'Malley and The Kadin. Apparently...so is she. Either bring Skye back from the dead or let her go. Each book starts off with ""I'm your third cousin twice removed from the half brother that was the fourth son of the fifth wife of So and so...."" There wasn't anything new in this story IN FACT the plot was ABOUT trying to be like Skye O'Malley. START A NEW STORY"
3,"Interesting Book, False Advertising.","I wish Ms. Small would realize her forte is in writing historical fiction, not romances. This book is so much more about the politics of the English Civil War than about the relationship of two people."
2,"Interesting, and yet disappointing","The ideas presented and explored in this book are interesting and are worth the buy.The arguments and justifications given to support the theories, on the other hand, are incorrect, misleading and baseless.I wish the author had discussed his theories (that are based on physics as it is understood today) with a good physisist. This would have prevented the book from becoming a piece of pseudo-science instead of simply remaining as a wonderful, thought inspiring, pioneering work."
4,Good Book,"I thought that this book was very well written and since I am from the STL I was excited to discover the story was set here. The book made me realize that in novels and movies, we often expect relationships to have fairy tale endings, when in reality life does not always work out this way. I was fighting for Nikai and Robert, I wanted them to work, but problems on both ends (mainly Robert's) hindered this. A good book filled with REAL emotions, REAL problems, and REAL people."
5,Excellent,"I've just completed this book and could not wait to give my review. The story is an emotional page turner. This story possesed all the components to make it a ""Best Seller"". I understand that this is the author 1st novel, but, I can see that she is a highly skilled writer. I was very impressed with the way she was able to bring ""Karen and Derek into the picture without skipping a beat. Overall, a great story and a story that seperates the ""boys from the men"" and the ""ladies from the little girls"". Hats off to you J. Powell, and I can't wait for your 2nd book."
2,Completely unrealistic...,"There were so many things wrong with this book: First, it was way too long with too many unnecessary details. Second, nothing (I stress nothing) was believable. Who moves to another country with someone they have only know for a week? Who tries to have a baby with someone they know is cheating on them? Third, the ending; there were too many things that the author introduced but never addressed. What ever happened with the second music group? She moves in with the producer but are they a couple? Can she have children? I'm glad I got it from a discount store for only 1.99."
2,Do not buy this item - It is not well designed.,"This pen is very interesting, it has a great concept but it performs rather bad. The other reviewers were right in saying that this product fails in every aspect, its a great technical feat but it does not deliver. Some problems I found was when I was trying to scan a book, this becomes very difficult as you have to hold the book down, while holding the DocuPen hard against the book. Towards the middle the Docupen actually wrinkles the page. Now dont get me wrong, it works great if you were scanning a single page, but it fails for books. Its also rather cheaply made, I think the next generation of these items will be much better. A button to ""scan"" would have been better as well."
1,BROKEN BY DESIGN - A true piece of junk.,"Bought this thing expecting a miracle. Did not expect a piece of junk. It's cheap flimsy plastic (why not anodized aluminum for a $240-$300 device like this?). It TURNS OFF after every scan (absurd). It TURNS OFF while you are DOWNLOADING pictures over the USB cable (ridiculous product design).You also have to specifically buy san-disk brand mini-sd memory or it will not work. I had a nice Kingston piece. Did not recognize it. Nice to let people know ahead of time.Sorry, this thing is pretty much a rip-off. How these guys get away with this junk is probably BUYING OFF Ziff Davis PC magazines and relying on the lazy folks who do not return this broken-by-design piece of junk. EASILY THE WORST DESIGNED, WORST QUALITY ELECTRONICS DEVICE I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY ON."
3,Not what I expected....,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but more than I got at least. The book itself seems outdated and the ideas were for me, non-starters. I was disappointed though I'm sure there are several who really fell into sync with the book. Not badly done it just didn't trip my writing trigger."
4,Good read,"somewhat helpful insight on mens ministry and some of the opportunities we have in developing a mans attitude towards a good administrator with others and guiding young men especially in what God wants us to do. shipping was prompt and the product was as decribed. thanks, rod"
2,Out Dated principles,I have read this book and found it to be good on the nutritional side but very outdated when it came to Training and coments on the non use of suppliments. I would recomend Dorian Yates book it is much better.
3,Mystic Yoga,This video assumes you are in great shape physically and structurally. I am recovering from lower back pain and it does not work for me but I hope to be well enough to do it soon. I recommend this one only if you are not experience any back pain. :)
3,Spongebob for the Gamecube,"Lights, Camera, Pants is an average game, in my opinion. I'm sure that the target audience is children and my own children thoroughly enjoy this game, but from an adult-who-has-been-subjected-to-playing-the-game-repeatedly-with-my-kids' perspective, I found the game to be repetitious and hardly a challenge. Spongebob The Battle for Bikini Bottom is a much better Spongebob Gamecube game that I think kids can enjoy, but is still challenging enoubh to keep the interest of parents who play video games with their children."
3,Imitation Love - Jackie Merritt,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERPASSIONATE CONSEQUENCESCord Durant had learned to love Abbie Forbes during their one, unforgettable night of passion. It didn't matter that she'd walked out on him the next morning; she wasn't going to get away again. And after he discovered that she was carrying his child, Cord devised a simple plan to get the elusive Abbie back in his life--and his bed: marriage.Respected TV anchorwoman Abbie Forbes just didn't have one-night stands. So what had lured her into the arms of Cord Durant? As he proposed marriage with threats and ultimatums, Abbie had to wonder, and she had to choose. It was either a scandalous end to her career, or a commitment to a man she barely knew."
2,"Music is haunting, not peaceful","As someone who has Spanish language and music as a part of my daily life, I thought I would love this CD. I bought 4 CDs at the same time and tried them together: Acoustic Dreamland, Instrumental Dreamland, Daddy Plays and this one. This one is my absolute least favorite. unlike some of the other negative review I did not find the direct references to black people to be racist or otherwise disturbing at all. What bothered me most was that the music itself is not soothing. Much of it feels discordant which gives the disc a very subtly haunting feel, as if it should be in the movie score for something like Chucky or Dolly Dearest.If you are looking for truly soothing music that is agreeable for both adults and babies the current top choice for me is the Acoustic Dreamland by Putamayo. Those are literally love songs from parent to child. You may find that you love it even more than you little one does... I know I do."
5,This is a wonderful CD,"I am not aware of any cultural heritage songs on here (or lack there of) but it is a nice CD. It has a change of STYLE, rhythm and a change in tempo,varies by song! It's great! It seems like there is some songs sung by women, some sung by men. My only very minor little tiny issue, is that when we leave the CD on play (across the room) the last song is a touch faster than the previous song, and almost creates a stir on my sleeping child. Of course, I can never find the remote, so, maybe it's my fault. Anyway, my child is breathing even and slow, usually after just a few songs. The child falls asleep , so don't even make it to the end of the CD most nights."
3,Slightly offensive,"Since I do not know spanish, I was glad the words were included. I found a few of the songs racially offensive."
4,Book Review,We heard about this book on our recent visit to Stockholm Sweden. The book is a wonderful children's book and one that shoud be considered by parents.
1,curious george rides a bike,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. NOT WHAT ADVERTISED TO BE. NO ANIMATION. ONLY NARRATED A GRAINY FILM BOOK AND TURNED PAGES AS THEY NARRATED. MY GRANDSON HAD NO INTEREST. HOW COULD ANYONE? I WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE IT TO A CONSIGNMENT SHOP OR DONATE TO ANYONE, IT IS SOOOOO BAD."
1,Awful,AFter seeing the movie I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD... I was very disappointed.
5,Spectacular,"I was a little worried about buying this set b/c of the tone of some of the reviews, but I went ahead and did it and I regret nothing about it. This is a spectacular 3 CD set. The Bond CD is my fav, but the other 2 groove excellently as well. I would encourage anybody that likes trance to give this set a try. You won't be disappointed."
1,Nothing to recommend it.,"I've studied the ""Gated Community"" debates for years, professionally, and this book hasn't a single original idea in it--the research is rehash, the conclusions tepid, and the writing itself is sallow at best, and sophmoric otherwise. One suspects this project was designed for Ivory Tower purposes, as the authors give no indication of ever having been involved in Urban Planning in any way--a necessary prerequisite for a monograph such as this, I'm afraid.... MY suggestion to the potential reader is to simply relfect on the obvious issues at stake in any discussion of Gated Communities, and *think*--for the present volume is sorely lacking in intellectual rigor as well."
1,The stench of gratuitous antisemitism mars book,"I noted some mild antisemitism in the ending of this book. When I contacted the author, he sent me a warm missive wishing all religious Jews were dead. 'Nuff said."
3,"Not awful, but he is capable of so much more","When I read Titan, Wizard, and Demon more years ago now than I care to count, I thought to myself, this is some of the most imaginative Science-Fiction/Fantasy blended storytelling that I have ever read. The official review said that Steel Beach and The Golden Globe received tepid responses, I count them both in the top 10 of my favorite all-time sci-fi books.Red Thunder and its sequel both disappointed me, they are not horrible, but only die-hard fanboys are not going to see these as inferior to his older books."
3,"A nice tribute, but not up to Varley's usual standard","I love John Varley's other work, and Red Thunder is certainly a skilful tribute to Space Family Stone and some of Heinlein's earlier work, but it was not up the the standard of Varley's earlier novels.If you are an admirer of John Varley then I recommend you try Red Thunder, but don't expect another Steel Beach or Millenium."
4,Dead Water Creek,"Do you like fish stories? Morgan O'Brien must, because she found herself up to her neck in fish and murder, an unpalatable mix that smelled up the laboratory of her best friend Elaine. A complaint about funding from a scientist brought Morgan to Vancouver to investigate the financial aspects of research on salmon without annoying the researchers. But the combination of a missing research assistant, missing funds, a fraudulent resume, broken love affairs, all added up to a case of missing fish, secret formulas and murder. Complex relationships and tender egos add to the chaos as Morgan enlists the help of Dinah, another assistant, to unravel the puzzle's many loose ends. Talented author Alex Brett takes the reader behind the scenes of research and its complexities and variations. A look into academic deceit that has far reaching consequences in the world of fisheries. A recommended read for the mystery buff who enjoys a bit of science while following the trail of a killer. Enjoy."
5,Personalize a home with embroidery!,"Embroidery projects usually focus on clothing, but they can be used to personalize a home, too - as embroiderer Kristin Nicholas demonstrates in COLORFUL STITCHERY: 65 HOT EMBROIDERY PROJECTS TO PERSONALIZE YOUR HOME. From dragonflies on pillows to lap blankets, egg cozies, and more, these colorful embroidery projects lend to gift-giving as much as home embellishment. Each comes with a full-page picture and easy details on fabric choice, notions and stitches."
4,I Love Fisher's writing style but the topic wasn't broad enough,"The money illusion, AKA inflation and currency deflation, has been explained extremely well in this book but it's simply not the most interesting topic that Fisher has written about. He seemed to have to find too many examples to defend his case but it wasn't really necessary. He is a master of writing and explaining these complicated subject matters. This book simply isn't one of my favs of Fisher but it's a short book and the beginning of the book is the most valuable. In summary, well worth your time reading this very good book."
2,Definitely not a keeper...,"I had bought this CD based upon the tracks that David Gans had played on his radio show, ""Dead to the World"". Although the disc is a great listen the first time through, it certainly will NOT find much rotation in my CD player. There are stand outs, such as ""Cumberland Blues"", ""Black Peter"", ""Friend of the Devil"", ""Dark Star"" and ""Black Muddy River"". I'll probably just sell the disc to a used record shop, after taping my favorite tunes onto tape.If you can, borrow this disc from a friend. Don't bother buying it. The originals and many of the available live performances are much better than anything on this disc."
3,Weird Mix of trax,"A strange brew of all sorts of music, from hardrock to bluegrass to jazz. Some excellent material here, especially Elvis Costello , Dylan and the few jazzy songs. The a capella close harmony version of Black Muddy River brings tears to your eyes and is worth the perchase of this disc alone."
2,Two words ----- HENRY ROLLINS!!!,"Cream Puff War is a favorite of mine. And I spend my life listening to and touring with Widespread Panic. But for Henry Rollins to be on a Grateful Dead tribute album, disgusts me. He's everything the Grateful Dead was not. He's a straight-edge, violent man, who has never, ever performed a good song. Bob Dylan, diserved to be on, and the Stanford Marching Band was alright. But I don't know which came first, the Phish tribute or this. They both have the Stanford Marching Band. TOO PREDICTABLE! Jambands strive on switching it up. Not in good taste."
2,Real mechanics would never use this.,"Much of the info contained in this manual is just the most basic, generic mechanical knowledge, like how to gap a spark plug, etc. If you don't know a primary clutch from a secondary clutch, this might be a good book for you, but if you are looking for detailed info and specs that are specifically for your machine, get a factory manual instead. There was very little in this book that I either didn't already know, or couldn't have easily figured out on my own. Goes for pretty much all the Clymer manuals (car, truck, atv, etc.) that I have seen."
5,Bucket seat covers,"It is always hard to judge a product by a picture. They looked dark on my computer, but I ordered them anyway because I liked the graphic.I am so glad I did. They are actually a steel blue and they look great. I am very pleased and have recieved many compliments. They were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys."
4,car seat covers,this is a great item-love the way it looks and very durable-been on my car seats for at least a year-and still holding up-if there is one thing i could change about it though is it isn't made for seat with the seatbelts attached to the actual chair-therefore to make them fit-i had to cut a slit down the side-slip the seat belt out and sew it back up. but still looks good-and still holding up. nice product.
4,A barrel of laughs for the couple who can't stay indoors.,My husband and I love to camp and have done so since we started dating. We got this book to add insight to our endeavors durings our trips and it definitely added a bright side to our humor and technique. I hope you will enjoy!
5,Great Album,I absolutely love this album! It definately exceeded my expectations. Saints at the Gates is probably my favorite song on the album. I would recommend pretty much any artist on Yep Roc. :)
4,Overall Very Excellent!,"Michael Atherton did an excellent job re-creating the music of Ancient Egypt or what it might have sounded like in antiquity. A very relaxing CD oveerall.The only shortcomming was the female vocals. The singers, though good, sounded far too much like the Nuns of St. Hildegard of Bingen rather than more middle eastern sounding vocals. Had Atherton used vocalists similar to Azam Ali of Vas, or even from India or Egypt then this CD would have been absolutely perfect.Very well done otherwise."
3,Effective In Part -- Not Quite Enough Parts,"Atherton starts with a splendid idea and certainly enough talent to carry his idea off. Despite some fine moments in a couple of the vocal selections, the rest is very forgettable. Having done his bit for research, Atherton seems to succumb to the temptation to ride the CD out using a lot of faux-Near Eastern musical riffs that simply get tedious. Adding to what others have already said, I also wonder if the ancient Egyptians had such a paltry knowledge of musical form. This recording might have worked as an evocation of dockside bar music, New Kingdom, but that's about it. The vocal areas, unlikely as they seem, get the CD three stars. For too-brief but still shining moments, Egypt is evoked pretty well. Pity the rest was so blah."
4,Hang in there.,"When I first bought this item I really did not know what I was in for. I thought I was buying a listen and learn CD course. What you get are CD's, a dictionary, and a course book. I have to admit I was not keen on the idea of the course book and I hated the whole thing after a couple of days, but I stuck with it. Over all I will say that the course is good and you do learn to speak, read, and write Russian. This course teaches you how to pronounce the words really well. I feel this was better for me than courses I have tried for other languages. The only thing I really think could use improvement would be the CD's them selves. There is no English spoken with the words and sentences come one time really fast. You will find your self pausing and replaying a lot. If you want to learn to read and write Russian as well as speak it then this is a good course. If you just want to lean a few phrases and how to ask for things I might try something else."
2,Understanding Guatemala,"I could not put this book down.It was well written and well researched and after all of that, it was interesting. Spell binding.If you are interested in understanding what happen(ed) in Guatemala, you will want to read this book.Good visual descriptions.Who has the movie rights?Read it!"
4,Rainer sets it off!,"A fierce combination of brazilian breaks and nu-school jazz, this downtempo trio's offerings are a chill inducing affair for both oldschool jazzers and modern day loungers alike. A rare find!"
3,Not what I expected.,"I had purchased a white pumice stone in a local chain store before and liked the ""rough"" texture that would remove several layers of dead skin and smooth my heels without much force. This stone is not as coarse and will smooth my skin, but only works on the outer layer. I also purchased a razor to remove dead skin layers and that seems to work well."
4,great LITTLE watch,"I recently received this watch out in Iraq. It's taken some(alot) of dust, minimal water(shower), dings and hits in the gym and constant uniform changes(pins feel very secure). I can't yet put a scratch on it, I don't think I'll resort to a knife to do so. The alarm wakes me up and the large indigo display is great for a quick glance. It's very easy to figure out(11b) and program. It's just a tad thin when looked at on my wrist, but if you don't mind function over form, it's not terribly noticeable...given I am over 200 lbs, if it's not a huge g-force obsenity, it's bound to look small. I highly recommend it for anyone who prefers fabric bands."
4,Has Almost Everything - Durable,"This watch has really stood the test of time. My husband repeatedly buys this watch. But they seem to last forever, years. I am surprised it is still available. Great watch."
2,Not what I thought I ordered,"I ordered this product for my wife's work and Norton 2006 is the latest product that is usable on Windows 2000. I thought I was ordering Norton Internet Security 2006, but when it arrived I saw it was only Norton Antivirus. My mistake, not the seller's. However, it arrived ahead of schedule."
5,A Master in action...,"When you look into the so called ""world music"",normall you find a large selection of experiments that might interest you once or twice(if they do at all) or mostly a bizarre mix of musicians that are recording for the job.This record is just the perfect example of the opposite.Is so solid, so perfectly played, and concepts are so clear,that perhaps one of its main conditions is to show how very few good recordings of this kind really were made.The solo carreers of the components were later among the most important musical personalities of Brazil.Mighty inspiring music.Tastefull, and most important, great example of its time and futures times to come in music.Don't try looking for original copies if you do not have very deep pockets."
1,4 Ton Comealong,"Locking mechanism works sporatically at best. Cable frequently pulls out of drum.Not only will I not recommend this product, but I will go out of my way not to by another product from this company."
3,OK for small projects...Get the Factory Service Manual!,"This book is an ok resource, but the HUGE factory service manual will be your best friend. Pick them up for your specific year on eBay for $30 or less, and Haynes, Chiltons, and the like will be obsolete.I haven't picked this book up since I got the service manual...FWIW, similar factory manuals are available for most Chevrolet and Chrysler products...I've got fine ones for both my Jeeps, as well. If one wasn't available, I'd next look for a BENTLEY manual (not the car, the publishing company). If Bentley makes a manual for your vehicle, thats fine stuff, too..."
2,Too broad in years,"I think if they would narrow down the year range, this would be better. I have a 1968 Chevy C10 and I don't feel as though I always get the answer I'm looking for relative to my specific model year."
5,Beautiful Vocals,"I first heard about Sylvie after an NPR interview and I've been hooked ever since. She has a beautiful voice and this album along with her previous album, Tangos and Tantrums, showcase her talent wonderfully."
2,Boring and predictable,"Honestly, how someone can characterize this book as the most exciting thing they ever read is beyond me. I found the characters shallow, the story line completely predictable and the entire business of finishing the book simply painful to complete. If you're looking for a weak beach read, then this is your book. If, on the other hand, you're looking for something with actual suspense and depth, pass this one by."
3,Marks up your equipment,"These our great sticks; duable; feel great, however the black does come off and will mark up your cymbals and drum heads. You maybe better off buying the regular drumsticks and then taping them yourself."
5,So NY (i.w.i.n.) THE Darndest Thing (FIVE STARS),"After brief...This album is hot. Heavenly Packed. I can beat Lazar, Lampara and Moma. Why not? I just cant. Its Heavenly Packed. Sound will never be the same. It will never be the same. Disco Aroma is one of the best albums of otoño. And it will definitely jam the streets of New York. Pretty soon. Soon. Very Soon. V. Washington Square Park, Alphabet City, Williamsburg, Upper East, and deep inside straight to Baraza drinking CRYSTAL and saying hi to nestor (d flavor is on baby)"
3,If you got illustrator,tried it ... but soon found out that if you got illustrator you can export to text... and also you can import from word and convert to pdf... with illustrator save yourself the 50 bucks
3,Strap yourself in..,This real-life pilot writes a page turning tecno-thriller that keeps your attention all the way through a good action-packed ending. Bio warfare combined with the plight of the Iraqi populace make for solid reading.
3,Disappointed,"The foundation is interesting and the developing relationship between the two main characters has promise, but in the end, the book goes nowhere and the terrible editing was incredibly distracting. I generally like long books, but this book could have been about 300 pages shorter and accomplished the same goals. Strangely, I have an urge to read the sequel, which is why I've given the book 3 stars instead of 2. Sorry to be such a downer, but I was actually shocked at all the other great reviews."
1,Schindler's List,"This is a great movie, it's on my top ten. However it was very disappointing when I received the DVD in such poor condition. It has so many deep scratches on it that we even can't play it. It was a waste of time and money. Beware of this seller. They say their products are in ""New Condition"" which is a flat out lie. It looks like a cat used this disc to sharpen her nails on. I will not use them again, ever!"
4,nightwatchmen of bush and plain,"A beatiful book that you just can't put down. Details the lifetime search for owls in the australian bush by the author David Fleay. Whether for a scientific study or for pleasure, read this book."
1,My strap has a metal buckle--not Velcro,"The official description of this product doesn't mention the type of band closure, and it is not shown in the picture. I relied on information provided by other reviewers and chose this watch because several of them mentioned the Velcro closure. I never would have purchased this product if I had known about the metal buckle."
5,Great functions,This watch has a countdown timer that I use at work and that many watches don't have so it is perfect for what I need.
3,"Good Interface, poor materials","I've had this watch for about a year now and it's falling apart. Strings are hanging off of it, the strap keeps falling off and the face of the watch has several deep scratches on it. And I don't put it through much more than just wearing it every day. The strap notches are spaced about 1 cm apart, which for my wrist either means I wear it skin tight or loose and floppy.That being said, it has been a great cheap ""interim"" watch. It's not at all dressy-looking, but it has a big, clear display, lots of features, and it doesn't beep when you press anything (that drives me crazy!). Also, the watch face is a bit slimmer than other comparable designs (1 cm), and it's lightweight. If you can find this for $25 or less, you probably won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a permanent or rugged watch, this probably isn't it."
5,"Old one died after 2 years, bought new one",I had one for about 2 years and I beat it up but it still worked great until the batteries ran out. It lasted longer than I expected. Buying on amazon was cheaper than at miejer...
2,Too narrow for eyeglasses.,"I bought this for a second pair of eyeglasses to go into, but this particular holder is too narrow to fit most eyeglasses into, and the base is really light and easy to tip over. I have to leave one of the ear pieces out, and even then, it is so snug, you need one hand to hold the holder and the other hand to pull out your glasses. Not good. I tried to mangle it a bit so I could fit my glasses into it more easily, but it wouldn't budge. I actually bought two of these and both are the same, so it wasn't just the one that got made too small."
4,I got to keep it!,"I bought this for someone else. It was a little tight for her glasses, which are not very large. I kept it because I like it a lot."
2,Tapestry Eyeglass Holder,"This product is not made very well. The fur was detached from the frame, and it was lop-sided when standing upright. Would not purchase this product again. Thank you."
2,"Sounds like something from ""Come on Over""","Sounds just like ""That don't impress me much"". Hopefully the rest of the album will have something a little more refreshing and not sound like the rest of ""Come on Over."" Something a little different would be nice."
5,It works,I bought this for my sister after she had read about it in a book. Was able to save her about $80 by purchasing on Amazon. She says it really has lowered her blood sugar an average of 7 points on her accu'check.
3,Frying Pan,(haven't used it)I bought this size frying pan to use when I cook large quanties of food to freeze for 'ready to eat meals' later. It is a very comfortable weight. I like the handle.
1,All the idiots in one place,"So it's come to this. It's not bad enough that we have to be assaulted by Moore, Franken, et al in their individually published fevered rantings - now we have a COLLECTION of liberal pap all tied up in one neat package. It's a virtual boxed set of whimpering and sniveling being passed off as astute commentary. To the already convinced, enjoy your poisoned pabulum. To those with enough sense to see through the childishly circular arguments presented here - start running like hell - and don't stop until you're far enough away to escape the odor of these burnt offerings."
3,Great Rooster Model,"Decent book, somewhat dated. It has by far the best rooster model I have found: bird base plus several easy folds."
3,One-Way backs on cards!,"Why? Why?Why was this deck made with a, ""One-Way"" back design?You can tell what direction the is facing by studding the back of the card. Tarot card back need to by symmetrical."
5,Amazing deck!,"95% of my decks are in Rider-Waite style. So I wanted to buy real RW. This deck is very nice! The old good Rider - Waite in colorful, vibrant way! The colors are vibrant, but not harsh. The people's faces are jentle and peaceful. The size is ok, not large or tiny, just standart size. I am a beginner in Tarot, so this deck is for me."
4,Rider-Waite,I really like the colors. The deck is very bright and I think more attractive for some people when doing a reading.
1,Apparently this was a book was fiction,"Based on the fact that it was announced today that Scott Speicher's remains were identified, and that he was shot down in Iraq, it appears that the author's ""Pullitzer Prize nominated"" research was way off the mark. This book should now be classified as fiction - lots of drama and intrigue, but no truth."
5,better then sonicare!!,"This toothbrush is a bargain, and better then the previous one which I paid 3 times the amount for. With the round brush going around, and the square brush going back and forth, you can get into all the wood work that the he plain round brushes can't get to. I'm really happy with it, and I also got the pack of 3 heads on here!!"
4,Why by a more expensive one?,"To believe by default that sale price reflects the quality of the product it is kind of wrong. To talk about cost value, is another story... The value of this tooth brush is so excellent as the product itself."
4,quite a bargain,"I've been using these kind of power brushes for yearsm, and this is excellent. The new brush takes a bit to get used to, but sems to work well. For the price, it's hard to beat."
4,Works real well,Got this as a stocking stuffer for my wife for X-Mas and she uses it everyday (like everyone should). She loves it and she says it works well and does not want to replace it even when I asked her to buy a more expensive dual one. She won't get rid of it.
3,Too big for my mouth,"The battery in my Sonicare only holds one brushing's worth of a charge, so I decided to try an Oral B rather than spend another $100+ on a replacement.Having used it twice now... It's just too huge. I can't keep my mouth properly shut while using this, so I drool all over the place. It's a bit annoying.I MIGHT see if there are smaller replacement brush heads, but might not. Otherwise it seems okay, but again, since it's so huge it seems like it's not quite able to get the inside surfaces of my teeth. It should be noted that I'm a fully-grown adult male, not some elfish gal with a teeny tiny mouth."
3,Works great for the price,I bought the Vitality as a temporary brush until the repair on my Oral-B Sonic complete was finished. Considering this brush costs less that $20 it's excellent. I'd still rather use theVitality than a regular toothbrush if I had to choose. I think it keeps my teeth much cleaner thanmanual brushing.
5,girls of tender age,"I found this novel to be captivating from the first page into the last!!!!!!!Having been raised in this area of Hartford, CT, I found myself actually reliving my childhood years. It was such a powerful novel in that it was sad but yet funny in some areas. I definitely want to read more of Mary-Anne's novels and encourage other readers to do so."
4,Nice Book,"Okay Condition and Super Fast Shipping! Cover was a little tattered & the upper left hand corner of the book seemed to be chewed on, but over all the book was in good condition. Also there was what seemed to be a coffee stain on the outter pages of the book but the inside pages of the book were not stained at all."
3,bottom buddy,"It is a great help ONCE you figure out how to use it, i.e. how much paper, etc. to use. Thank you for this temporary help."
2,Not Working for me,"I really haven't figured out how to make it work for me. There were some instructions, but perhaps I can make it work some day, but I felt like I wasted my money. It seemed to need a lot of strength to clean between my buttocks and I don't have a lot of strength. I really liked the bag you could put it in for storage or to go someplace outside your home. It seems to be built pretty sturdily."
3,Bottom Buddy,"This is my fourth purchase of this product and have found it to be a very useful product. My only critizism is that it has a weak spot in the handle above the release button, and end up breaking at this spot. I usually wrap a few layers of electrician tape to beef up that area.Bottom Buddy Toilet Tissue Aid"
4,Roll of Wrapping Paper,"My order was received and processed quickly through Amazon. I received the roll promptly but one spindle insert had fallen out of the end. Got return shipping label immediately from supplier. Sent the roll back, since they don't supply just parts, and soon received a replacement. It was complete and was satisfactory wrapping paper."
5,Kids love it!,My 3 soon to be 4 year old needs guidance with this but is very interested in doing/learning the activities which are great for developing his writing/reading skills.
5,IA tutor,The quality of this used book was listed as being very good. It was like new; thank you very much.
5,For the history books Larry Burkett was spot on!,I remember reading this back when it first came out and I'm glad I did. I learned the necessity of living within one's means and staying out of debt the best one could. Now it's 2009 and we all know he was right. Our house of cards has come crashing down and we all suffer the results which will last for a long long time. Thankfully I listened and have paid off my last big debt which was my car. Now I'm for all practical purposes debt free with ample savings to live comfortably when I retire. Thanks Mr. Burkett from one very grateful reader so long ago.
1,Wholly Unoriginal Work by A False Prophet,"In the old testament when a prophet made a prediction that didn't come true they were exposed as a false prophet, taken out and stoned to death. I'm certainly not recommending it- just putting some perspective on our extreme tolerance for people that are consistently WRONG in their predictions. Only God knows what's going to happen, and it's GOD not government, or even we ourselves that provides for us. Burkett and a whole host of ""Christian financial advisors"" put WAAAAYYYYY too much stock in ""planning and preparation"". I don't discount it, but they do it and recommend it to the point of pride and idolitary. Do what YOU are supposed to do, and let God do the rest. Quit WORRYING (as worry is a sin) and trying to predict the future and get on with your life!!!"
4,Nice shoes.,"I am a recreational bowler, I don't even bowl on a league, but I go often enough that it is more economical to buy my own shoes than pay $4 a pop for a shoe rental. I really like these; they are comfortable, and just ""girly"" enough. The pink is a lot brighter in person than in the photo, though. We'll see if having my own shoes will improve my game, 'cause it needs some work!"
5,Buy this book now!,"""Soundly"" is a wonderful way to look at things - wholistic and positive without being draconian or extreme (or wimpy, for that matter). The book makes a great case for holding yourself to a higher standard (without knocking yourself for being less than perfect). Unlike just about every other diet/fitness/self-improvement book I've ever read, it's simultaneously reassuring and inspiring. It really was motivating to read - and not in that panic-stricken, last-gasp-for-salvation sort of way. He manages to give directions/plans that are both concrete and flexible - and even entertaining at the same time. All without the merest hint of self-righteousness or fanaticism. Not to mention - I've gotten the most amazing results so quickly."
5,DeMented forever!,"This soundtrack, being absolutely fabulous, is naturally perfect for Cecil B. DeMented.-luna"
3,the soundtrack is not complete,"Hi can anybody help me about the soundtrack romeo must die,it is not complete.I mean the scene where jet li goes to his brothers appartment and when he opens a closet and than find a baseball,then he get's memories about him and his brother in the sea,when they where little.While during this scene there played nice silent music(i believe a asian one) i have bought the soundtrack,but this track is not on the original soundtrack,where can i find it. What is the name of this song,who composed itCan any one help me please."
2,Sounded better in the movie,"The movie was great; the tracks went with the cinematography and amplified the imagery. By itself, I found the tracks a disappointing collection of self-absorbed wanna-be gangsta noise, not an enlightening beat or lyric to be found anywhere. If you enjoyed the movie, take the time to listen to the cuts on this CD before you buy to be sure it's what you want."
5,"A Wonderful, Wonderful Book","This wonderful little book is chockful of famous people who failed before they became successes, and the message of the book is hard to miss: never give up! When you discover that the Beatles were rejected by nearly every major record label, that George W. Bush was arrested for drunk driving, that John Grisham's first book was rejected by twelve publishing houses......well, it makes you feel like you can accomplish anything as long as you remain persistent. I can't recommend this book enough. It's great for anyone on the road to success... from high school graduates to aspiring writers, artists, and musicians... to anyone in your life who wants to make a difference. It can be done!"
3,interesting but not really complete documentary,"A very interesting documentary about the person Bob Moog, but I expected a more complete history, more about the full range of instruments wearing the name ""MOOG"".Further I miss important names as Wendy Carlos, Manfred Mann and others who helped Moog to become famous around the world.In spite of all this I'm happy that there exists a DVD to celebrate one of the most important inventors in musical history of the second half of the 20th century."
1,Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Unbelievable!!! The worst piece of crap ever!! My son loves ""Transformer"" type toys and we've been buying them for a long time. Even though some of them have been a little ""junky"" they always work. This hunk of junk is virtually impossible to ""Transform"" (and I've had a lot of practice!!!!) Don't waste you're money, both you and your child will end up frustrated!"
5,Fly Fishing With A K Best,Received this book promptly and am very pleased with it. I have not been able to start it but look forward to reading it. I was very pleased with the condition of the book and dust jacket.
3,"OK for the 24m old set & younger, ""Cozy dozy"" ""Cuddle Duddle"" a bit much","This book features full page illustrations of a parent animal and their baby asking the repetitive question in a very large font ""How does a <animal name> hug?"". The answer is the likes of ""snuggle wuggle,"" ""fluffy duffy"", ""swing-a-ling"", ""Pouchety-boing"", ""cuddle duddle"" etc. It's pretty saccharine stuff.Age: Might be very cute for the 6m-15m set, but definitely *NOT* for a child older than 24m. Basically, if your child is at the speaking stage, they will likely be offended that you are reading this book to them. I think my son would still have been offended even at a younger age. I personally wouldn't give it as a gift at a baby shower, unless the mother thinks baby-talk is super cute."
5,Good microphones for a home made Karaoke,"These microphones were a present for my dad, who has a home made Karaoke. He was impressed with the quality of the product and especially the price because it was very cheap. He won't need to spend more money in batteries because the base includes a charger. Excellent product."
5,awesome and good priced!,i'm geting this mic and i think that the price is pretty good but i had to earn 20$ to get this but if you buy the cushion things that go on it it looks pretty good!
3,Fairly good writer - for attachment parents only,"The author is all about attachment parenting. If you are an attachment parent, particularly a full time stay-at-home mom, you may get a lot out of the book.I personally did not identify with her and would not have made all the same choices. She complains that no one understand her, she's contemptuous of anyone else's advice, she resents help when it is offered, she feels like her husband can't possibly understand / doesn't get it - AND she complains that she feels so isolated. Part of me sympathized, this is a smart woman dealing with a very emotional, tough time. Mostly I grew impatient with her self-imposed martyrdom. But she is clearly a thoughtful writer and I'm sure a lot of people do go through what she went through. It's not a bad book, so I'll give it a 3-star rating."
2,"better than nothing,maybe.","This book isn't too bad,but not nearly good enough. I'm not sure just how stupid a human would have to be to benefit from it. The lessons or whatever they are,are so easy I stopped making my kids do them. there is nothing to learn from coloring in empty squares and filling in the empty letters of an incomplete alphabet. I do not suggest it."
5,bookreview,This book contains a wealth of rarely discussed historical facts that show the immense beneficial influence of Christianity on western civilization.
4,"Decent move, but only for serious runners","This is no Prefontaine movie. Ryun didn't have the charisma nor cockiness of Prefontaine, but he was a much better runner. There are not going to be any Hollywood movies written about him, so this will probably be your only chance to see what a great runner he was on video. This is a good movie for those serious runners, more racing and less drama."
3,good little portable seat,"i have a medical condition and need to make sure I can sit down when I need to. I have another one of these that has a round seat, this one is square and would be better if it were a little bigger. I do like that it sits higher up than the other one. I keep one in my car, and the other with my suitcase to take if I need to travel/fly....a lot of long lines and too much standing for me. These cane seats are a necessity for me"
4,"i like it, but...","this is a good mouse, but my first one would double click on single clicks after about a year. i bought a new one and the buttons seemed a little too ""loose"" for my preference. eventually got the cheap logitech one and it's been great."
1,product info wrong,"This item is NOT supported by Windows 95, It is unusable to me and I have to return it."
5,Wired works,"Yeah, I know, everybody wants wireless mice and keyboards these days. But the good old MS opticalUSB wired mouse never gets flaky due to low batteries, never needs ANY batteries at all, and never fails to work.It also costs only about $12 and has for decades. This is the only mouse I use, if I can keep getting them for all my computers - and so far, I have.If wireless is so cool and reliable, why do router manufacturers insist that you manage your router setup and settings with a WIRED computer?Wired works. Your refrigerator, radio, phone, TV, Playstation/Xbox, and all that other stuff will NOT interfere with it. It never breaks. It's the best computer hardware deal there is."
3,Lacking Features,"For a couple of dollars more, you can get one that fits in your hand more comfortable, has back and forward buttons on the sidem and doesn't make an annoying sound like this one. Its called the Microsoft Intellimouse Optical. Its ten bucks more, but its alot better than this one. I have both of these, and i prefer that one. You will notice the differnce. But, this is still a great basic mouse."
2,It's for kids,"I think this product is very nice for kids to play with, not for someone who is professional. The sounds are bad and the touch sensivity sometimes doesn't play, and others with one touch we hear many times the same note.The publicity should be more especific."
2,d'addario strings titantium ukulele concert EJ87,"I installed these strings on a mango wood uke because it has a soft tone and wanted to see if this would increase volume,according to d'addario. No, they sound ""dead"" compared to Aquila I had on. Seems like glorified fish line to me. Aquilas will be going back on."
3,Tune tight,I have tried many brands of baritone strings.D'addario string seem to need a lot of tension my uke groans and cracks under the strain.Also the tension is harder on my fingers.
3,Louder bull duller,"I replaced the original black nylon strings on my baritone uke with these based on other recommendations. The wound strings are louder, which is good, but the unwound strings aren't as bright as the old nylon strings. They actually sound like worn strings, particularly the B string. When it's time to change strings again, I'll look elsewhere."
2,no widescreen,"The back of the dvd box clear states that 3 of the movies are presented in widescreen format yet when I played those movies all of them are in fullscreen with no option that I can find to play the movies in widescreen, which I prefer, so don't buy this item unless your ok with fullscreen format. Just wish I knew this before I bought the set."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"Great series but BE CAREFUL!...There are two discs in the set and BOTH times I purchased this set from a retailer, both disks were of the same episodes. Instead of Disc 2 being of episodes 8 through 13, they were again of episodes 1 through 7 (even though on the disc it said it was disc two with episodes 8-13). I was very disappointed. Like I said, I bought it twice from the same retailer and both had to be returned due to this defect. From what I saw of the first disc, I loved it! I just want a complete version!!"
3,"Fairly good, but from a British point of view","Lots of actual combat footage and interviews with actual people who lived through it, from both sides. Worth the price for whats included. A good weeks worth of viewing here. The intro music gets very boring."
1,Cass Creek NOMAD Predator Call and Mojo Critter Decoy,"Thanks for the fine products. Just what I needed to help eliminate my coyote problem on my beautiful Colorado acreage and at the same time have the opportunity to try out one or more of my AR15 black rifles while I get back into the coyote hunting fun and excitement.sgt maj (ret) Stan Parker, us army sf"
3,Good until one year later,"I bought this product on Feb. 23, 2003. It is now Feb 8, 2004 and the machine fell apart in my hand! 2 weeks ago it stopped brewing correctly, it would brew very slowly and would just sputter unless I gave it a good knock on the back and then it would brew for a few minutes and then I had to knock it again, and so on. Then today I went to turn it on, and the on/off button popped off! All I wanted as a cup of coffee and was willing to stand there and ""help"" the machine do its job but all I got was a button in my hand. And I never dropped the machine, by the way.... Anyway I really had no problems until today but I never expected this to be a disposable machine. The carafe is a bit awkward and I always got drips when I removed the carafe to pour, but was ok otherwise. Be cautious if you don't want to be buying a new coffeemaker in one year, like me."
2,"Good for making coffee, hard to clean, fragile urn.","This is a nice coffee maker for making coffee and the ""quick"" shut off of the dripper is nice for impatient people like me. However, cleaning the urn is very difficult as the size of the opening is very small. I am a man with small hands and getting one of them in this urn with a sponge is very dicey. Using a bottle brush just did not do the trick of cleaning the coffee grime that accumulates around the bottom of the urn. The lid mechanism/handle is cheaply made and came uncoupled from the glass a few times (I was able to fix that). Then the glass broke while cleaning another time. The web site for Krups is not very easy to navigate in order to find spare parts."
1,Affleck and J-Lo meet Tom Clancy,"What happened to Joe Weber? This is the second consecutive farce of a book from him. I had forgotten how much I hated the last one - I never would have bought this one if I had remembered.For some reason Weber has moved from ""classic"" techno-thrillers to a mushy, ""Nick and Nora"" couple who solve the problems of the world in between gourmet meals and great wines. There is no suspense, because there is no suspension of disbelief. I couldn't stand it after ten pages.The Job Weber corporation needs to ditch its current ghost writer and go back to whoever it wrote the original Joe Weber books that first put him on the map on the recommended list. This current work is garbage and the author should be ashamed."
1,Don't waste your time reading this,"After getting into this book I quickly realized that Webber really doesn't have his own style or persona. He has adopted his style from WEB Griffin and Vince Flynn. The only difference here is the ""one up man ship"" in the story line and plot. I saw many of the same ideas in Flynn's novels but toned down and more realistic. Webber creates the ULTIMATE DISASTERS on just about every page and quite frankly it got to be a little over the top.From Griffin's genre he has given his hero's enough money to be able to any thing they want. However, I find it absolutely unbelievable that they could destroy so much of their equipment and walk away each time. He makes the CIA look like inept amateurs when the continuously miss their prime target over and over.If someone were to ask me, if they should read this book; I'd most likely tell them no. BUt if they insisted, I'd give tem my copy just to get it off my shelf."
5,krups gusto 880,"I purchased this on ebay at a very reasonable price. (under 50.00)I can't understand what people are complaining about. The unit heats the water on one circuit and them pumps the water with the other. Simple physics here. You control the amount of water passing through. I have gotten the crema on every shot so far.The espresso flavor is controlled by the quality of bean that you buy and amount of water that you allow to pass. Obviously, if you are trying to get too much out of your beans and dilute the shot;its your fault for a poor cup of espresso. My expresso taste great and it certainly gives me the caffeine buzz. Try sweetening up the expresso with condensed sweetened milk (like eagle brand).No complaints here for the functioning of the product. No leaks so far. You can't beat the price of the unit either at this amazon site for new or on the ebay site for the refurbished units which will go for under [price]. Five stars for price to value here."
2,Shopping for a new Machine!,"Figured I'd save myself $ instead of padding [coffee shop] coffers. I'm now back to [a coffee shop] and here sits an expensive paperweight. After researching and reading about many different machines AND getting a recommendation from a co-worker, I bought this machine. The espresso is VERY weak - no matter what you do. I have a grinder that goes from very, very fine to coarse (professional grade). Doesn't matter what I do, I cannot get the espresso strong! I've tried for over a month and I can't return it now. Doesn't even TASTE like espresso, tastes like strong coffee. If like me, you are trying to find a machine at a reasonable price, pay a bit more and get another machine. Otherwise, like me, you will be buying a replacement or forking over the $ to your local coffee shop."
5,A SHARP UNRELENTING ANALYSIS OF THE DESTRUCTION OF A WOMAN,"IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE THAT DIANNA WAS HERSELF OF NOBLE BIRTH - SHE WAS IN THE END - ONLY A WOMAN WHO HAD SERVED THE PURPOSE ROYALTY REQIRED OF HER. HER MISTAKE WAS THAT SHE BELIEVED IN, AND MARRIED FOR LOVE - SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED AND SHE WOULDN'T DISAPPEAR, SO SHE WAS SYSTEMATICALLY DESTROYED- THE AUTHOR TRACES DI'S DEMISE BY THE CLASS SYSTEM."
3,For die-hards only!,This a is good disc for the hardcore fan. It collects all of Vai's film contributions and jams it all on one disc. It's a compilation. Most of the material is very Vai but it feels rushed or 'light'. This is certainly not as 'DEEP' or on the 'same level' so to speak as his other solo recordings which seem so much more focused and artistic. He's playing for the films basically and it comes off that way. Some of the material is highly entertaining and borderline histerical especially the Crossroads stuff. This is for die-hard fans only. It's hard to imagine Vai gaining a larger audience or attracting new listeners with this. It feels like filler to keep his hardcore fans occupied till the next REAL solo effort.
1,Total Waste of Money - no warranty - bad electronics,"Bought because it was simple and small. Had the same trouble as other review for CD playing - skipping, etc(wish I had read the reviews before purchasing). Kept it because I was going to use it for my MP3 player playback. What a mistake -- started getting speaker hum after 2 months and just past 90 days no sound. The company warranties the product for defective parts for 1 year per table on warranty, but when you call and after spending 30 minutes on hold the outsourced telephone representative tells you that it only has a 90 day warranty because there are no replacable parts.Do not waste your money on this product. There is no warranty and the company uses defective, low quality parts that will not last."
3,Good action/Poor dvd,"The case of this movie looked so good so I bought it. Well, when the first scene comes out it looks like someone grabbed a personal camcorder and started filming. What a big dissapointment. The action is great, but poor poor video quality. Rent it before u buy!"
3,nose ring,"good if you are able to put these types of rings in , not as flexable as they say they are."
2,Generally disappointed although useful info obtained,"I found a great deal of the content to be superficial and there was also a significant amount of redundancy throughout the book. A VERY beginner-oriented book. That may may well justify the redundancy and emphasis on (shallow) breadth rather than depth. While I still have not found any other books that address what this book attempts to address, because of the reasons cited above, I can only give it a modest recommendation."
3,Hmmm...,"I can't help but wonder if the 22 reviews -- all giving this book 5 stars -- are some of the author's closest friends. I am not saying I didn't like the book, but the writing was drab. Through the first few chapters, I got it, Buck O'neal was a good man. So, I'm just saying that the stories were not told in a way that made me connect with Mr. O'Neal --he was just a nice guy and then he died. There are a few editing errors as well, which made it confusing. I am by no means a critic of writing, but I just don't see the amazing book everyone else here did -- anyone agree with me?"
5,Awesome!,"I was expecting to receive a book that was in poor condition, as it stated in the product description. However, I received a book that had no torn pages, nothing written on it - it was in perfect condition! Considering how much I paid for this item, this is awesome!!! Thanks to the seller for sending me a great book for school!"
3,"Plus points for being organic, but not that tasty","This popcorn has a distinctly different smell from the non-organic popcorn I'm used to. It also tastes different, but not better. Plus, I find more kernels unpopped over regular brands. Update--I was going to try another brand. I tried the Orville Redenbacher organic. It was awful. So in comparison, this Newman's Own brand in much better. I'm buying it again, and now think that my previous order of this from Amazon may have been exposed to a lot of heat. Hopefully, this time around I'll get a fresher batch. If I could revise the stars above, I'd give it a 4."
2,Problem with Leakage and Temperature,"There were wonderful directions and diagrams for using this product, so I have no complaints there. However, the machine took an incredibly long time to warm up and I either had to run a whole container full of water through it or make several espressos before it would make coffee that was actually warm. The warming plate never got warm enough to keep the cups warm. While it worked moderately well for making one cup, when I would try to make additional cups by taking the filter basket off and putting fresh coffee in, it would not reseal, and would thus leak around the filter basket. The troubleshooting guide in the owner's manual indicated that this problem was caused when grounds got trapped between the gasket and the filter basket, however, no amount of cleaning (and burnt fingers) seemed to make a difference."
2,"Adequate machine, worth the low price","After using the machine for a few months now, I can almost make a decent cafe latte. The espresso shots produced by this machine are not good enough to drink straight, so the foamed milk masks the bitterness. The machine's automatic frothing wand doesn't do a great job, but it is convenient. The machine takes a while to heat up to the right temperature. The ESE espresso basket doesn't work for me; it leaked everywhere and I quickly gave up. As for regular espresso, it seems to do an adequate job if you are very careful about the grind of the beans, the amount of grounds, and the tamping pressure. Screw the basket in _very_ tightly or it will leak. Always descale your machine with those tablets.In sum, if you aren't picky about your espresso and you'd like a cheap machine, this isn't a bad gadget to pick up. If you are a coffee geek, buy a fancy machine. You get what you pay for."
1,A Lemon No Matter How You Do It!,"What a disappointment from Krups! It took 3 pair of hands, a roll of paper towels, a separate cone filter, numerous cups and ALOT of patience to get a very poor version of Starbucks!"
2,Mostly Instrumental - Boring,This CD is mostly instrumental songs and my son was bored of it easy. Make sure to listen to all the songs before you buy it. My son is a Thomas the train nut and the other CD's I have bought him with more songs about the trains and from the TV are more loved.
2,Disappointing for Kids,We were disappointed with this CD. There are so many wonderful Thomas the Tank Engine songs on the videos that we were hoping they would be on this soundtrack. No such luck! Most of the songs are unrecognizable to my toddler Thomas the Tank Engine fan.
4,A classic study guide for Office Specialist Certification,"This a classic study guide for Office Specialist Certification. It helps a lot in passing the exam and contains a CD rom for the exam questions and answers. However a previous basic knowledge of Microsoft Office is necessary and which could be obtained through Training via interactive CD roms, now available at a reasonable cost."
3,Good and Bad,"Specifically regarding, Desert Trail with Dawn Rider from Cascadia Labs. These two John Wayne films from 1935 were produced by Lone Star Pictures which cranked out films in five days. Unlike other Cascadia releases, this has one excellent version of an early Hollywoood ""Cowboy"" or ""Western"" film. The Desert Trail source print was in excellent condition. But, the Dawn Rider print was in poor-to-fair condition.So, if you can find this at a good price then buy it for just Desert Trail. Look for another version of Dawn Rider because it is worth watching but not this version."
2,junque,"2 stars because it did crush ice, and because the store where I bought it let me bring it back, so I'm not bitter.however:-after the first use, the motor smelled like burned rubber-the glass jar doesn't lock or snugly ""fit"" in the casing when you use the blender - it just sort of sits there flimsily-all those buttons - does anyone know what all of these subjective sounding functions mean, or how many of them - ""mix"" vs. ""blend,"" ""liquefy"" vs. ""purefy,"" - even differ from one another?Keep your 12 buttons and give me an old-fashioned, 1 or 2 speed, solid kitchen appliance."
2,Good cheap blender but will only last a few years,"It's loud, the bottom gear strips out and gets harder and harder to get it to catch. It doesn't rotate food very well inside the blender jar because of the narrowing bottom. For something cheap, fine. If you want a good blender that will last this isn't it. This isn't the same Oster they used to make."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!Oster is junk,"Don't waste your money!!!!Oster is junk.........I have owned a vintage Oyster 10 Speed from the 1970s. I had used at least 4 times a week for 25 some years. What a great blender it was. It had finally died 4 months ago. Since then I have had 4 OYSTER blends. I tried 2 14 speeds- 2 12 speeds. Each one of them the motors smoked and quit. WHAT A PIECE of crap oyster is making.I thought after 25 years they would have made them better! NOT!!!!!!!!. I make a smoothie just about every morning with bananas, a few frozen strawberries and yogurt. It can not handle that. So today I went garage saleing and found a vintage OYSTER blender for $2.00. Works great. Im sure it will last longer that any new one I bought. I will be looking for more antiquers for backups.DEAR OYSTER COMANY: You have just lost a customer. No more products I will buy from you. You better go back to making them the way YOU USE to-because I will not keep buying."
5,"A cookbook for everyone, great variations on old favorites",What a nice surprise! I purchased this book expecting recipes that would be great for Florida. What I found was a book full of terrific recipes that are for anyone living anywhere. There are traditional favorites with unique twists and fresh recipes using creative combinations of readily available ingredients. I particulary like the selection in skill and prep time. There are quick and easy recipes for last minute plans. There are also more involved creations for an enjoyable rainy Saturday afternoon. The use of fresh ingredients and emphasis on healthy recipes was an added bonus. It's true; Junior Leagues really know how to collect the best recipes. I would recommend this book to anyone (it makes a great gift too!).
4,Does Decent Job,"While the CATV reception is not as crisp as a traditional TV, it is acceptable. If space is not an issue (depth of tube), then a traditional TV is a better choice. If space is an issue, this monitor offers good trade-offs. In addition to the compact size, the price is far better than the LCD TVs. We are very satisified with the performance and the warranty."
1,False Advertising!,"Wow, what a total disappointment. This is NOT a flat screen monitor. It's a great price for a 17"" monitor, but it is not what was promised. I will be sending this back first thing in the morning!!!"
5,4 by Four,"I have been LOOKING for this cd for the longest time. These are my babies. I had the cassette tape when they first came out. I played it so much that it got caught in my cassette player. I was a hurt teenie bopper. This is a very good cd and I'm so upset that they are no longer around singing. They were pretty much one hit wonders. OMG!!! My favorite song on this entire cd is ""Come Over."" I can still remember the words right now today and I'm 41 years young. I pretty much love the whole cd. When this cd came out I was in the 9th grade. I am so happy to find a seller last week via Amazon that was selling the cd for $50. I could not resist it because Four by 4 is worth that."
5,One Last Go....,I loved this DVD. I am a huge Ab Fab fan. I miss this show so much. I didn't care about the complaints from the other viewers. I bought it anyway. It's Patsy and Edina!! Sweetie Darling!!
3,It's OK but.....,"I purchased this for my son who is 10 and in 4th grade. The description did say for ""late elementary school"". Well, more times than not, a word my son needed to look up for homework was not in this dictionary. I'd say this edition is good for kids first getting acquainted with a dictionary as it is not intimidating, the definitions are at elementary reading level, and the pictures are a nice touch. However, by the time a kid is in 4th grade, this dictionary just isn't ""meaty"" enough. Also, it did not come with the CD as described."
2,Highly disappointed,"Purchased this book for my 4th grader. Yesterday she brought home a dozen words that she needed to look up in a dictionary and write the definition. THIS DICTIONARY HAD ONLY ONE OF THE WORDS. Since I had just recently purchased this book, I will be returning it. Not a good dictionary for children at all. Thought I was getting the best when I bought Webster's. Highly disappointed."
3,A good overall source of information,"If you're looking to learn about the ARM system architecture, this is pretty much the only game in town.It provides a good overview of many aspects of the architecture, however, it leaves out many key facts and in places confuses the simplest of issues.It is full of illustrative diagrams and examples; however some of the tables you are better off not trying to understand (see above about confusing otherwise clear subjects).Overall I liked the book, and even though it's 4 years old, it's still pretty relevant."
2,"Output is fine, input is not","I bought this for my MacBook Pro, which has line-in but no microphone input. I wanted a microphone input so that I could use a headset with Skype. I plugged the unit in and had to do nothing else (no drivers necessary). However, I found that no matter what I did, the input had a constant loud noise in the background. It varied if I touched the USB adapter or the computer, but it did not matter what microphone I tried. I also tried to move it away from the computer using the included extension cable as well as a 6ft. extension cable I use without issue for my HDTV tuner and neither improved the noise."
1,Poor design,"The basket release is difficult to operate, and broke on the second use. The heating element seems under-sized. If you want to cook frozen fries, you should know that 3 pounds will take forever. Better figure on 3 ozs."
5,Love these boots!,"These boots are so cute. Two of my gal pals now would like to order them, however, sizes are becomeing scarce. The boots have great traction in the ice and snow and are to my surprise are comfortable. They look adorable with a skirt."
3,there is a scratch in one the boots,The boots are very pretty. The Size is also proper. But there is a scratch in of the boots.
1,"Compelling Story, Poorly Reported.","This could be a haunting story, but it is made annoying by the author's hack writing style. I'm sorry I spent time and money on this book."
5,Excellent Album!,I heard the song raincoat on the radio and instantly fell in love with the song. When I found out the artist's name I went to Amazon to check out the price and reviews and discovered that the album had received rave reviews! I bought the CD and definitely agree with all the terrific reviews. It is a wonderful CD with every song very enjoyable. I have listened to it in my car for several weeks now and have yet to tire of it! You will definitely find an excellent deal with this purchase!
1,WARNING: Do not buy this copy!!!!!!!!,"First of all, my rating does not go for the movie. It goes for the quality of the tape. I bought this movie because I love the movie ZOMBIE and I bought this before Anchor Bay released a remasted copy of the film. The quality of the tape is the worst I have ever seen. First of all, it won't play well in ANY VCR!!! It jumps and scrolls up an down the screen for the entire film! The color is horendously. It is UNWATCHABLE! T-Z video (a division of EDDE entertainment) got the rights to an awful reel to the film ZOMBIE, blatenly added their own spliced in title called ZOMBIE 2: THE DEAD ARE AMONG US, and released it on the unsuspecting world. DO NOT be fooled by this, pay the little extra and get the remastered version by Anchor Bay. I cannot stress this more!"
3,Good Pratical Book,I used this book when I took OR class and I think that the book is quite good but it lack of theory calculation and also scientific calculation about each problem. In general I still believe that this is a good book.
2,Spongebob is Great But...,"I didn't like this game very much. It was okay at the begining but I couldn't skip the dialogues at all when I accidentally clicked on the same thing twice. That wasn't too bad, but all you can do in this is look for props and cast members to be in your episode. There's only one episode so it's sort of repetitious and there are no points or rewards for having the right characters in the episode (or so that I know of). Yeah, it's fun at first but I haven't finished it and probably won't since there's nothing new."
3,Pops Corn,I found this popcorn to be pretty much tasteless. The kernels were hard and there were lots of husks in it. I won't be buying this again.
5,Tastes like old fashioned popcorn,"I am delighted with my new Pop's corn. I eat a bag of popcorn just about every day at work because it's only 2 weight watcher's points and it takes a long time to eat, and is relatively healthy. I had been buying a different brand but decided to try Newman's Own because 1) it's organic and 2) the ActII was often good but occasionally not so good, so the quality control was questionable. Anyway, I have only had about 5 bags of this but so far it's very good. I like my popcorn slightly browned (much to the chagrin of my coworkers sometimes) because it improves the texture of it for me, but I am happy to report I like this popcorn without ""burning"" it because it pops up light and fluffy. So I recommend it."
2,Other organic is better!,"I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past. I have to agree with the other poster, the popcorn is bland and almost flavorless. There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better. Don't waste your money on such a vast amount of product!!! I would suggest even making your own popcorn- it is still going to be healthier than this and you can flavor as you like so it will taste much better than this!"
2,Not for those with conservative values,"I bought this film because I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan. Shah Rukh Khan appears as a narrator briefly before the film begins and the storyline occasionally pauses for him to interject a few comments here and there during the film. The story depicts the lives of three women who are seeking independence and to discover themselves. It shows them making choices which might be appealing to people who don't hold to traditional, old fashioned values. I think the point was to show the process as women were ""progressing"" in society. Because I have conservative values, this film was very un-appealing to me. And as big of a fan I am of Shah Rukh Khan, it was not worth buying, even to see him. In fact, I thought it was incongruent to have Shah Rukh Khan associated with this film. It's true, he does represent romantic love. But, his life reflects traditional (what I consider ""high quality"") values."
4,Worked fine for a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder,"The small instruction slip was not sufficient, but there were plenty of wiring hints online at club3g.com and with my JVC headunit. I ended up soldering the 3 blue wires together (the blue amp power wire on the amp power harness, to the blue antenna wire on the other harness, to the headunit blue remote power wire). This seems to work, but I don't have a powered antenna."
1,Fireworks-Dud or Stud?,"I first bought this product because of all the good reviews I read about it that it ranks right up there with Photoshop. This may be true if you can ever figure out how to use it. Unlike Photoshop, you won't find any good books or tutorials on how to use this product. Now if you can't use this program, what is it worth? Certainly not what their asking for it.I do see that Macromedia has work shops that you can travel to and some internet training for their products but at a high cost, and I don't know if they are any good, and I don't care to spend the money or drive the distance to find out.In my opion, if you can't provide a good tutorial and include it with your product and not as an added cost, then what good is your product to the average Joe.In my opion this Fireworks program is a dud, and these good reviews that I've read about Fireworks are not coming from the general public but from industry exectives."
1,These Fireworks Got Wet!,"When I heard what this program could do to energize my web site I was excited. However, the developers of Fireworks slighted the most important component of good software--help files & tutorials. The documentation is full of errors & ommisions. The help files are so archaic that they are useless and the user interface is not intuitive. Fireworks 4.0 by Macromedia may well have incredible capabilities but they are of no use if the user can't figure them out. The term ""fireworks"" conjures thoughts of a big bang in a small package. But we all know what good a wet firecracker is. In my opinion this box of fireworks has water damage."
2,Dries Out Wipes,"It dried out my baby wipes so badly I had to pour water into it to keep them moist. After two months, I just quit using it."
1,This is a waste of money,"Don't but this. Don't register for this. You do not need a wipes warmer. We tried ours, which was bought as a gift for us, and ended up tossing it. We didn't even bother donating it to Good will because we figured no one in his/her right mind would want the darn thing! It dries the wipes out, and by the time you get the wipe to baby's bum, the wipe is no longer warm. I don't know why they are still making this product. It is completely worthless."
4,"May not be a necessity, but is convenient","I have been pleased with this wipe warmer, despite reservations about getting it based on the reviews it has received. We have not had any problems with wipes drying out, browning, or burning smells. It makes using wipes more convenient, because when you are changing your baby it is much easier to yank a wipe out of this heavy unit with one hand while holding baby's legs away from their mess with the other, rather than struggling with a light package of wipes that may require one hand to hold the package while using the other to pull a wipe out. The wipes do cool a bit when you take them out, but they still are not as chilly as wipes straight out of a package."
2,Totally UNNECESSARY,"I don't have this model with the light, but we have a Dex wipe wamer. I wouldn't have purchased one but a family member gave it to me. As others have stated, this thing dries out the wipes, so much so that they really are ineffective. I thought it would bring my baby comfort because they would be warm, but instead I need to use a ton of wipes to get her clean. She really doesn't seem to mind when I use wipes at room temp. The only way I would recommend this is if you live in a very cold climate and it's really cold in your house."
3,Not warm,"I like the design of it, but, beside the fact that, it does not dispense, it is not warm either, the only things I would say its it is not super cold. I need to speed up to every time when I clean my baby."
4,Blending In,"This is best blender I ever had. It crushes ice effortlessly and blends an extra thick and smooth shake without any ice chunks. However it is extremely noisy, that's why I deducted 1 star."
1,Fell apart twice!,"The first one of these that I purchased fell apart within the first week. I flipped the switch and it made an awful noise. When I picked it up, a washer fell out of the bottom and I could hear other little parts clanging around inside. I returned it and got another. It worked great for about a month or so. Then yesterday the same thing happened! Flipped the switch, terrible noise, washers fell out and I could hear other parts clanging around inside. I have no idea what happened, but I am not happy. Amazon is kindly taking it back for a full refund. I will not be getting another Oster."
1,Breaks easily,"Worked great until the RUBBER coupler between the motor and the blade sheared off while making a smoothie using frozen fruit. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews of this product because they were absolutely RIGHT! This thing DOES NOT have an all metal drive as advertised right on the box!I used this thing for less than two weeks before it broke, and although it did a nice job blending, the reliability/durability just isn't there.Ignore these 1 star reviews at your peril!"
1,Piece of...,"What a disappointment! The Oster Classic Beehive blender decided to end its life after the 5th smoothie with a ""burn out"". Here I am shopping for my third blender of the year! I wonder KitchenAid or Cuisinart is any better considering its high price.Does anyone know who I should contact regarding the ""trash""? I bought it 8 months ago so it's still under the warranty. Do you know if there is an Oster branch/office in Australia?"
1,Piece of Crap,After reading all the favorable remarks I got sucked in and purchasedthis blender. It broke after 5 uses. I had metal parts falling out of the motor.It was extremely unstable and never felt like the blender was securelyattached to the motor head. Do not buy.
3,Loud,"We have used the blender a few times so far and it works okay - not outstanding, but not awful either. For the price, I think it's just your average blender. One thing to note - this blender is LOUD!"
3,"LOUD, powerful, classic.","After a while you learn what amounts of ice, milk, etc. work in this blender. I guess they sell different blades, but everything I've tried to make with the default blade require shaking the glass around and trying to push down the ingredients so they blend properly. This thing is loud like a jet engine and your neighbors will hate you for it."
1,CHEAP metal,"I've always had an Osterizer, but the metal in this model was of the cheapest kind. The metal in this model ripped apart like tinfoil in less than 6 months, whereas my model from the 60's lasted over 30 years. I guess they don't make them like they used to."
4,"Powerful, loud, cracked plastic piece","This blender is ridiculously powerful, and just as loud. It will pulverize ice and frozen fruits, but they may take some stirring and jostling to make it to the bottom of the blender.The glass jar is sturdy but the plastic bottom cap cracked in two places within a year of purchasing it. Fortunately Oster provided a replacement cap at no charge in spite of the fact that the piece isn't covered by the warranty. The customer support call was quick and easy.I recommend hand washing everything but the glass jar to prevent warping the rubber lid or damaging the plastic bottom."
2,Great... while it lasted,"I thought I'd finally found the perfect blender, and it worked great - for two months. I used the blender exclusively for smoothies, usually made with chunks of frozen banana, OJ, and yogurt. I was careful to make sure the blender was running and there was plenty of juice in the jar, but the ""all metal drive"" broke - there is actually a hard rubber coupling beneath the drive spindle, and it sheared right off. Oh well - on to the next blender! I also have to agree with other reviewers about the noise - this puppy will wake the dead! Don't plan on making midnight snacks with it."
3,Retro in looks and sound,"I purchased this blender to match my retro kitchen, as it is similar in design to the blender I grew up with. It looks and works just like the old one, except the blades are much sharper! I still need to pulse and stir to get everything mixed evenly. But the one real complaint is that it is so incredibly loud! I am tempted to put hearing protection on when using this. Other than that, this looks and feels like I expect an inexpensive, yet quality Oster to be."
1,Repeated failure,"I bought this blender based on the good reviews that it had received. Unfortunately, these reviews did not consider reliability. The black plastic ring that holds the glass pitcher broke right away. Oser gave us a new base for free (one time). Well that part broke again. Based on the lack of durability, I would not recomend this blender. Additionally, this is a very noisy machine."
1,Breaks when used with frozen fruit,"I make a smoothie almost every day with milk, frozen fruit, and spinach. I bought this blender because it had such great reviews, and I wanted something that would deliver consistent results. Well, this is not the one. I've used this for about a week, and yesterday when I added the frozen strawberries, the part that connects the blade to the motor sheared off. I'm not even sure how that is possible, but apparently it is. I'm going to return this as defective and try something else."
3,Have your earplugs handy?,"I absolutely love the retro style of this blender and had to have it! I normally just use it for making fruit smoothies (with frozen fruit), and it does have a hard time getting through the chunks of mango. I can only imagine it would be worse with something harder like ice. But I'm a patient person, so that doesn't really bother me. What does bother me is that it sounds like jets taking off in my kitchen! I literally have to cover my ears when I'm using it."
3,Damaged,"The product looks great, and I'm sure will work fine - but just wanted to give users a heads up that is came with the a broken part (the circular plastic peice that inserts into the lid). Would be such a hassle to send this huge thing back - luckily, I called Oster and they're just goign to send me the piece for free.Just wanted to let people know...I buy everything online, but after this I'm thinking this type of product might not be the best thing to get online...I would have been really annoyed if I had to figure out shipping back this huge box back bc of a damaged item."
5,Powerful & Effective Blender - Well Built!,We are very satisfied with this blender! Buy this one and do not bother with the rest. It has steel parts and it is simple and easy to use. This is the muscle car of blenders (sure it is loud but what do you expect?). We love it!
4,effective but LOUD,"This is a great-looking, great-working, sturdy, but LOUD blender. I am satisfied with its work, and I love its great looks, but I am not exaggerating to say that I wear hearing protection when I use it. (You can get cheap, effective ear plugs at a drug store.) If you're okay with that, you will not be sorry to have this product."
3,"Nothing Special, meets basic needs.",I was under the impression it would chop ice - it doesn't. It handles frozen fruit (e.g. strawberries and bananas) - but don't expect to throw full ice cubes into your smoothie.
2,Very dissappointed,"I owned an Oster in the past and when my friend dropped the glass jar and we moved, I just threw it away and said I would buy a whole new one. I wish I hadn't because it was much better than this one and Oster doesn't make it anymore. On the Osterizer, the jar spins on its base making the bottom spin off if you don't hold it in place yourself. The lid is a thin, cheap plastic that doesn't even hold liquid inside very well. In my old Oster I could shake what is inside to get it to rotate a little better when it chunks up. On this one I just have to stir like other cheap models that can't get the job done on its own. At least in my other one I could pulse it and put it on a combination of liquify and Ice Crush which is usually all I needed. On this on there is only one setting so I have no other options. I wish I had bought either another model or another blender."
4,Simple but does its job,The blender is sturdy and does its job well. The only thing I have to say is that I decided to make soup one night and felt terrible for the neighbors as it was rather late and the motor on the blender is pretty loud. Almost sounds like a drill.
3,Already smells like burning electrical...,"My last one burned out, but it took a few years. Evidently that's what happens with everyone. Yes, it's loud but it works well. It also looks good."
2,Not ice (or anything else frozen) crushing,"Did research to find a blender that would actually crush up my frozen fruit. Oster even states this blender has ""ice-crushing blades"" but the fruit just sat in the bottom and that old burning rubber smell started up after a few seconds. I ended up putting tons of water and o.j. in and still no movement. The fruit on top just sat there. :(This blender is only good for mixing drinks and maybe some yogurt or protein powder. Forget using it on anything frozen though."
2,2 speeds off and high,"Good for smoothies, terrible for soupEven with the lid tightly closed and my hand holding it down, the soup ran all over the counterCould be improved with a low setting.If the smoothie is too thick, the blender will dance around in a circle twisting the cord around it.Must be used with hand holding down the lid.Does make good smoothies."
1,Broke a year and a month after purchase,Which means the warranty is expired.It's very underpowered. When making smoothies I had to divide up the fruit and add it a little bit at a time...even after that the blender still had trouble processing.Stay away.
2,spend your money elsewhere,"I hate to say this about an ASC album, but this is simply not worth the money. There's not much here to like. 'E to W' is decent and the rest is pretty blah. If you're into ASC by all means give it a try, but you'll probably be disappointed. And if you're new to them please do not start with this album. Give Mare Vitalis a try instead."
2,Interesting but not worth the money,"This album really has some interesting riffs and ideas, but that's pretty much it. It sounds like the sketches you make when songwriting or the kind of songs you throw away after a couple of months because they simply aren't good enough or doesn't go anywhere.If you are a ASC fan, this is an interesting listen, but still not worth the money.If you haven't heard ASC before, then buy Two Conversations or Low Level Owl because that's their best work so far in my opinion."
3,"Much the same, but some gold here","Much of the album quickly blends into other Mould songs...they are great because they are Mould, but beyond that not too outstanding.Having listened to him play guitar all these years, I find the ""music"" of this album a little lacking. Huge chords and a lot of noise but not too much really good guitar like the older stuff.Still, I have to admit that every time I get about 3/4 of the way through ""Moving Trucks"" I can't understand why this song was not the #1 song in America. That last change between ""today is the day I can fly"" and ""no moving trucks to hold me down"" gets me every time"
2,outstanding product,I am extremely happy with this product. It works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick. It's a superb design and I am very pleased. I would highly recommend it.
4,To Know Her Is To Fear Her!,"Jessica (Spider-Woman) Drew made her debut in February 1977 in Marvel Spotlight #32 - which is included in this volume - and had a nice run of 50 comic books from April 1978 to June 1983.The initial 25 comics of her series is included, along with Marvel Two-in-One #29-#33. The artwork is excellent, though it took several issues to get the story line confidently moving forward (there are many parallels to the transformation of Peter Parker to Spider-Man). The character also had an animated series, appearing from September 1979 to March 1980 on ABC's Sunshine Saturday Morning.This is a nice collection for a solid character that may not carry the same punch with collectors today, but had ""All The World Against Her"" back in the day."
3,roulette secret revelated,"this is a good book about roulette, very simple and clear,in this world there is a method for win a lot of money"
3,13 Great Duets from Tom's 80s TV Show...,"This is a collection of duets with Tom Jones from his highly successful 1980s North American TV show. As the title suggests it features performances with his showbiz friends including the Tina Turner, the late Dusty Springfield, the soulful Isaac Hays, actress Cybill Shepherd, to the rhythm and blues song of Teddy Pendergrass. [Running Time Approx. 50 Min]"
4,upbeat and great to listen to,"i really enjoyed this cd! its really upbeat and has a good feel to it. every song is thouroughly different from one another with different kinds of moods of the song. thought I have to admit some are kinda repetitive and a little boring which would allow me to skip a little of the song to go to a part that i like, its still an enjoyable cd! if you like something different with cool grooves in a song, this ones for you!"
3,Where ?,"Anybody know where this was filmed ? I can`t find any location info on it. I notice the gas station is an Enco. This is what some Esso stations were called in certain states before they all became Exxon in `72 or so. In the game arcade I see some familiar attractions like the baseball game, the submarine game, and the helicopter game. I can remember playing all three of these on the boardwalk in Rehoboth Beach, DE in the early `70`s. Really brought back some summer memories. Another early Michael Douglas film you might want to take a peek at is called ""Adam At 6 AM"". That one I know was filmed in Missouri and is also sort of an early `70`s time capsule."
2,Bleh,I was really hoping to enjoy this book. There was something just not right about it. The writing was OK -- I wouldn't call Tom Perrotta a genius. The plot was fairly predictable. The only thing that surprised me was when Todd didn't take the bar exam.This was another Da Vinci Code for me -- totally overhyped and not worth my time.
1,A lousy book full of generalizations and the author's biases,"It's almost laughable. In a book based on stressing the importance of notholding prejudices, the author's characterizations are full of them. Note how he falls back on biased notions to draw the characters of the ex-cop and the Republican stay-at-home mother. There are no shades of gray for them at all. The whole book lacks depth and the reader walks away with nothing to ponder. I'm no prude, but it's funny how the only characters the author puts upon a pedestal are the child molester and the adulterers. No wonder Hollywood is making this trash into a movie."
3,Good but not great,"Not as good as Joe College or the Wishbones, but still, a good novel about a bunch of typical suburbanites. He's right on about the mindset of a lot of people who get married and have kids then wonder what the heck is next. The characters are unpreprepared for the lives they've created (or fallen into) much like many people we all know. And like most people, they proceed to screw things up even worse.A good, quick read that you can ponder as long as you like afterward, as it brings up a lot of interesting issues about American life."
