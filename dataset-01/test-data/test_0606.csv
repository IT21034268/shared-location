2,Not good for begginers,I've read the reviews before I decided to buy. Most of the customers said that the shape was just perfect for getting BP's that's why I bought it.. and after few tries I really have a hard time using it especially because of the shape of it and the way it is supposed to be handled. the bell is also sensitive even if i'm holding the edge of it..I wouldn't recommend it for beginners like me. A normal-shaped one would be better.
2,Not a fan,The bell is extremely noisy on this scope. Any movement on the bell seems to overpower anything else you are listening for. I sent this back and ordered the Classic II SE scope.
4,Beautiful Colors,That's beautiful and my doctor daughter loved that!! With different colors is more dificult someone steal and it has a good quality.
5,Great product for price,"I'm a recently trained EMT-1 and my instructor told me to purchase a starter Littmann for my first stethoscope. I found this product on amazon.com and saw that the price was greatly reduced, so I purchased it. I'm happy with the quality of the stethoscope, but since I'm new to the field and have not tried many other stethoscopes, I do not have the knowledge of how it compares to other similarly priced stethoscopes. It works well. I can hear lung sounds and the pulse for taking a blood pressure measurement quite well. Like I said, I bought this product because my instructor, who has been a paramedic for almost 20 years, told me that a Littman stethoscope was the way to go. I would reccomend this product for an EMT-1 like myself."
2,Maybe it's just me,"I couldn't hear well out of this. I heard better with my crappy Prestige stethoscope. I sent it back, bought the Cardiology III (which is too expensive, in my opinion, but I was having problems with the ear pieces hurting in the Prestige, and the cheaper Littman Lightweight wasn't doing the trick with sounds), and really like it. The oblong-shaped diaphragm piece on this product may be good for blood pressure measurement, but it's not as great for heart sounds or for listening in small areas (or on small chests). If you don't have the thing pressed down just right, part of it sticks up, and you can't hear. I heard a lot of ""artifact"" buzzing and rustling, but not much in the way of lung sounds and heart sounds. I don't think it's worth the money...I'd say either go cheap, or go expensive, but this product didn't cut it for me."
4,Great Stethoscope,Very good acoustics. If it lasts as long as my previous Littman (11 years) I will be very happy. Only problem is that the headpiece is heavier than the rest of the stethoscope so it tends to slide down towards the heavier end (head piece) if worn around the shoulders.
5,excellent stethoscope,the shipment was fast and arrived as expected. the stethoscope is made with high quality. the sounds that I can hear from a Littmann is different from other stethoscopes. I will definitely buy again from this seller.
2,Cant hear breathe sounds.,I bought this because I am a broke nursing student. Well I have never heard a breathe sound with this and quite frankly the throw away stethoscopes in isolation rooms work better. I just bought the Littman master classic II steth and when I got it I was so excited that I could actually hear out of it. Dont waste money on this just get a better one the first time. It costs more but it will save you a headache later.
5,I Love This Stethoscope!!,"I'm a nursing student and I wanted a better quality stethoscope than my school had given me, so I purchased this stethoscope. I'm very pleased with the sound quality, which is especially helpful as we are doing cardiac and obstetrics this semester and have to be able to detect abnormal heart sounds in both areas. I love this product and would highly recommend it. The price is also really good considering the quality. I also love lavender!! I was torn between the pink breast cancer one and this one, and I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,GOOD TOOL FOR MY PROFESSION!,"DAILY USE FOR PRIMARILY GERIATRIC RESIDENT'S ASSESSMENTS/EVALUATIONS OF THEIR CARDIAC AND RESPIRATORY STATUS...WORKS WELL. THANKYOU! P.S. Would like to see the color choice of ""WHITE"" OR ""GREY"" however..."
4,WoW,"Jenny is very hot & has no shyness What-So-Ever. like ""Wake up & Stretch"" a fantastic review of beautiful female anatomy !"
2,dougv,"The book has short stories by many authors.The stories are from the magazine Guidepost, which I didn't realise. To me, their stories are mediocre and don't hold my attention.The books by Corrie Ten Boom are far better. She says much in few words and is a very good teacher. Her experience in a Germanconcentration camp gives her comments depth and impact.Rather than buy this book get Corrie's books."
1,okthe corral!the earps and doc holliday a novel,This novel is the most boring one I have read on Doc Holliday. Not sure where the author is going with it.
3,good for beginners,"This children's book is written simply and would make a good beginner's book. However, it really lacks a plot and a purpose. You learn of this old couple's struggles being poor, but you never develop a fondness or any type of feeling for them. As you finish the story you're left thinking, ""What a waste of time."" There is no true ending to the story and you're left hanging."
5,"This book lives up to its ""bible"" title.","Consumer advocate Green tackles the entire gamut of expenses you're likely to face in life ... and in death ... covering everything from infertility treatments to funerals. Whether you're looking for child care, problem-free moving, or the best airfares -- this book has it all!"
2,Not right for me I guess,"Judging by the great reviews of this book, I thought this was going to be some life changing book that really spoke to me. Instead, the book was very difficult to read and I found myself having to sit down and force myself to read to get through it. I would read through a page and it wasn't making any sense. It was like reading jumbled words that had no meaning. Maybe this book would be useful to someone who is on a higher spiritual level than I am."
4,Great resource in spite of proofing errors,"I've had this Bible now for about one week, and I've been devouring the information. A lot of work was put into this resource, making it a wonderful tool for sharpening one's witnessing skills.Having said that, I am very disappointed in the many typographical and proofing errors that appear in a lot of the notes and help boxes. Missing punctuation, incomplete words, lack of spacing between words, incomplete references, etc. are all too common. Call me persnickety, but this kind of stuff just bothers me. It is clear that whoever handled the proofing of this Bible did a less than acceptable job. I have contacted the publisher regarding this and am waiting to hear back from them.If this shortcoming doesn't bother you, get this Bible. As previously stated, it's a great resource for sharpening one's witnessing skills."
4,The Girl With the White Flag,"This book is about a young girl, who gets separated from her sisters and as to wonder the war fields alone. This book will make you cry, by hearing the tragic things this girl saw. ""The Girl With the White Flag,"" was a good book, but it was very hard to believe such terrible things could happen to a little girl. The little girls name is Tomiko, and she meets up with this elderly couple. The woman is blind and the man has no legs or arms. They help Tomiko out a lot, and they give her a lot of strength and courage. She calls this couple grandma and grandpa. This book is not really a childrens' book though, because there are a lot of parts in the book that describe what this girl saw. One of the things she does is take the dead soldiers' food out of there backpacks. I enjoyed reading this book and I would like to find more out about world War II. The author of this book is Tomiko Higa."
4,Hope and Miracles,"This book with its unadorned account of survival through the terrible battle of Okinawa is an important reminder of just how cruel war is, especially to those caught in the middle. Little Tomiko struggles against all odds and lives to tell this amazing story of desperation and courage. Not for sensitive kids; I would recommend this to middle schoolers and older - this is the real thing, not just a video game. Heartbreaking and horrifying, but with beautiful moments and miracles."
2,Powerfinder Pro CD 1999,"As far as content and ease of use is concerned, this product is very good. HOWEVER: You can only export a total of 5000 records and you are not able to remove duplicates before you export (so you waste tons of records!). When you use up your 5000, you are prompted to call a toll-free number to purchase additional records and the company charges you an arm and a leg... up to 3 times more than you paid for the original software for a smaller number of records! And you can't just buy a new CD if you've already installed the first one on your computer! Looks like they've got you coming and going..."
3,No equations here....,"Yes, I agree. This isn't a ""pure"" mathematics book. It is often superficial. It does tackle many social and political issues. All that said, I still enjoyed reading it. The author provokes people to think about the topics and question whether a mathematical approach would clarify these ideas and points of view. Every day, the popular press bombards us with new ""scientific"" studies that supposedly tell us about causes for the ills of our society. Often, these studies use questionable mathematics to support their conclusions. As readers, I think we can all fall prey to believing the studies that support our views of the world and disbelieving those that run counter to our beliefs. In the Universe and the Teacup, the author tries to get readers to scrutinize and objectify this information a little bit more. Unfortunately, I think the book suffers a little bit from the malady it's trying to address."
5,Math Project,"I purchased this book for a math project I had to do in college math. The book has a lot of great stories pertaining to mathematics. Overall, whether you like math or not, the book is still very interesting for you to discover that math is involved in alot of things we do not realize."
3,Been Done Much Better,"The other reviewers have it right: Other writers have assembled rambling connections to provide insight into the interrelations between arcane sciences and ordinary life. Few have done it worse than this. This book illustrates that intelligence and education do not always correlate with insight and depth. With so little going for it, I am surprised that this book found its way into print. Both you and Miss Cole must have better things to do with your/her time."
4,If it's good enough for them...,""" I must admit that I bought this book because I had read that it was the only MBA preparation book that has been supported and sponsored by Goldman Sachs, Mckinsey, BCG, Bain and some other leading companies.When you get hold of a copy you soon realise why they backed it. It's about as comprehensive as a MBA book can get(more than 600 pages written in small fonts!) - perhaps there's even too much information - and the fact that it's been written by MBA graduates makes all the difference"""
1,WARNING! Don't Buy This!,"Purchased a set of these radios (2250BK-2) and received 2 unopened packages. Both sets of radios from 2 packages (all 4) do not transmit or receive a signal. Basically garbage out of the box. The best part (being sarcastic) is that the company has no support whatsoever. You can call their number and have fun wading through their automated phone system, but it's pretty clear that this whole product line is DOA and should have been recalled. Thank goodness I won this for $0.01 on ebay."
2,not what i expected,Tried this in my 2004 nissan frontier. Didn't work as i wanted. Had to modified it to fit.Would not advise any one to buy this to work in a 2004 frontier.
5,Woman of Hospitality Bible Study Book,"We're using this in a neighborhood study with women from our church. Dee Brestin is an excellent author and this is a topic many women today need to study and apply. While hospitality is generally viewed as having people into your home, this study stresses the hospitality of our hearts: opening our hearts and our lives to minister to others in the name of Jesus. Great study!"
4,A great review,"This is not a workbook for the novice. It assumes a pretty good prior knowledge of the language. I have two years of high school Spanish and two years of college Spanish, and it is very challenging for me, especially the vocabulary. Excellent review workbook, however, with all of the vocabulary in the back of the book. If you want the answers to the exercises, however, you need to order them from the publisher."
5,Workbook in Spanish,We live in Costa Rica and had this book sent to a friend in California so we could pick it up on vacation. The book arrived in plenty of time for us to get it and take it back with us.
3,A so-so introduction to VB.NET,"This book might serve as a decent introduction to VB.NET and some basic .NET concepts. It does provide some useful guidelines for VB6 programmers to migrate to VB.NET by highlighting the key differences between the two. However, if you have a strong OOfoundation (especially if you are a hardcore VB6 and C++ programmer), you won't get much out of it. ASP.NET and ADO.NET are covered in roughly 6 pages each, and they certainly don't help too much either.The examples in this book are terribly formatted. The indentations are inconsistant, and program segments are not properly aligned in most cases, and that makes the code very irksome to read. That is truely unprofessional, considering the examples are mostly under 20 lines. I can't imagine myself reading badly formatted code like that for a few pages -- I would probably tear the book apart.Hardcore developers? Look elsewhere, you deserve a better book."
5,I AM SOMEBODY,"LOVED IT!! Very insightful. I felt like I was the musician. Loved the friendship of Sam and Helena. I love Toby/Ruby. Would love to know what happen with them. This is my first review so, please forgive me if is a little lite. I would highly recommend this book. It gives you an inside view of the music business from the side of the musician from unknowns to superstars.To Be Someone"
3,Antique Linens&Lace Field Guide,I found this to be a helpful reference guide to a collector. The pictures are clear and the descriptions are good.Not much in the way of pricing but good information to help learn about the multitude of antique textiles. This is a good addition to a collectors library.
1,[bad],I wish I could get my money back on this book. It took me foreverto read it and I still did not finish it. Threw it in thetrash can. It may have been more funny on a cd.Save your money people
2,vintage bag,"I purchaseed this product for my daughter to use to college. She tells me that after a month of use, with only 3 textbooks it became heavy and the straps did not give her the comfort and support she needed. Now its just sitting in her closet. I guess it wasn't originally made for school books."
5,Birthcontrol Hoodoo Man,i was listen to this record in the 80' and im totally forgot how good this band was until i heard it on a radiostation this was really good old rock and roll still today specially Gamma ray
3,Good not great,"These are good liners but they are no way a custom fit. I drive a 2010 Rav. I knew when i bought them they would not be a perfect fit from reading the other reviews. They are a better than average floor mat, just be aware they will not fit perfectly."
1,Good Idea; not practical,"I had a problem with easily opening this product. It was very hard to get each individual part open. Also, the compartments were too small and not able to hold 8oz of powder formula and I don't see how it would hold a small child's snack either. I gave it 1 star for the idea."
3,Are these BPA-free?,"I don't have this and am thinking about getting it, but is this BPA-free? If you look on the bottom and see the recycling number, if it is 2, 4, or 5 it's BPA-free, if it's 1 or 3 or 7 it probably has BPA. I wish they listed what kind of plastic it is! If it is 7, polycarbonate, then it HAS BPA. Can someone help out?Thanks!"
4,good but not perfect,I like this product but you have to move around the compartments to really get all of your premeasured formula into the bottle. I wish it were easier to get it out. I use this product to cut down the hassle of night time feedings.
4,"Little old, but useful","As a vegan and a guidebook junkie, I'm always on the lookout for restaurant guides to whatever particular area I happen to be visiting next. I have yet to try out a lot of the restaurants mentioned in this book, but my favorite part is that the author notes the difference between when a restaurant has vegetarian choices, and when they actually offer vegan choices. Also, fun to read!"
5,Excellent resource,"We are ordering this as an update to the one we've been using for the past couple of years. Offers good, practical advice to determine where to go when to catch what! WE use it frequently -- my husband reads it just to DREAM about fishing -- We both use it when planning a trip."
4,Master of the Wah,Earl Hooker unfortunately didn't live long enough to get his due.I believe this is his last recording with a few older classic tracks added on.This showcases his tasty and restrained or intelligent use of a wah wah pedal.Good crisp recording - for anyone that appreciates the blues.He was really peaking as his health was failing.R.I.P. Earl
5,I had forgotten......,"I just reintroduced myself to this wonderful musical team. I have all their films on VHS and i'm hoping that someday someone will have enough sense to put them on DVD. As far as this CD goes it is wonderful. I've written reviews on most their films. I saw them all as a child at a festival many years ago. I'm not in their era, i'm really a product of the 60's but their music was like none other and if you think about it, it paved the way for such operatta's like Les Mis, Phanton, Miss Siagon. I'm still in awe of Jeanette and Nelson. What beautiful voices and perfect pitch. I think my favorite song if i could really pick one would be ""Lover Come Back to Me."" The emotion is overpowering as it is with most of their duets. Refresh yourself by buying this great CD and let your mind fall in love all over again."
1,"Dude, where's my Outlanders?","I don't know anything about the Guardians but I know about the Outlanders and that they were not in this book, even when bad facsimilies with their names were on the page. I knew after the first chapter that this one was not written by Mark Ellis, the series creator.Awakening was a very angering book for a lot of reasons, the least of which was the ""Team Phoenix"" attitude that Kane and Grant and everyone were a group of incompetents and they were the ""real deal"". This was a very dishonest and even nasty tactic on the part of the writer, Victor Milan.I buy the Outlanders series so I can read about the adventures of Grant, Kane, Brigid, all of the Cerberus crew, not about a bunch of thawed-out lowlives with gun and movie fixations.I hope this writer has not taken over the OL series because I don't think I'll care to be around to see what he does to it."
4,Not Meyendorff's final position,"Although Christ in Eastern Thought is a wonderful book over all, it materially fails in its evaluation of the Cyrillian-Miaphysite Christology professed historically by St. Severus and contemporaneously by the Oriental Orthodox Churches. Indeed, subsequent to the writing of Christ in Eastern Thought, in which Meyendorff acurately, if noisomely, repeats the anti-""Monophysite,"" Byzantine party-line propaganda, Meyendorff participated in scholarly dialogs with leading Oriental Orthodox christologists and expressly concluded that their expression of the Faith is and has always been entirely Orthodox. Would that Meyendorff had issued a second edition of his book, as many may never discover what Meyendorff's more considered opinion of Oriental Orthodox Christology actually was. Apart from this one failing, Meyendorff's is the best English language book on authentic, apostolic Christology available."
5,Keyboard Controller Extraordinaire,The Oxygen 61 Controller is just what I wanted in a controller. The action is workable for most any circumstance I have come across. The Price was very good considering all the features
5,It deepened my appreciation for Vince Gill's musical talents,"After seeing Vince in concert and several times at the Grand Old Opry, I was curious as to how the author would capture this man on paper. I was impressed. I learned much of the early days and a glimpse of his personal life. This book deepened my appreciation for Vince Gill, the man, the artist, the musician and the great humanitarian. I highly recommend this for any Vince Gill fan. It was refreshing to see an author intent on portraying her subject with sensitivity and perception. I couldn't put it down!"
1,imperfect condition...,I asked them to replace the item twice since one of the handle was broken both times. The reason was so simple. They did not pack well at all! They never came in perfect condition... I simply gave up to purchase it after all.
5,Everything is Illuminated,"Everything is truly illuminated in this wonderful film about Jonathan Safran Foer, a young Jewish man, played magnificently by Elijah Wood, who, in the process of searching for his roots, transforms the lives of those around him."
4,very creative Movie,the film took me a little while to get into but once I did I was really enjoying the exchanges and various inter actions with each character.Elijah Wood was very Good in this film. the vegeterian scene early on cracked me up and the reaction he got in the House. the film is haunting and yet has it's moments where it makes you think and then laugh in places. but the pacing and overall direction of this film is really solid. I enjoyed this film which i viewed recently and the film will make you think and question so much.
1,consider other options,"We bought this phone for our son, within a week the outside screen busted. The main complaint is that samsung will not stand behind the product. We were asked to send $95.00 before they would even look at it. Or put it on our credit card, then maybe they could fix it or not, those were his exact words. We hung up and decided we will never buy anymore Samsung products. My niece has a nokia and they replaced hers for free and even paid all shipping. Think twice before buying this one."
5,Miracle pillow!,"This pillow has been a god send, I've been suffering with a trapped nerve in my neck and a subsequent muscle spasm in my neck/shoulder for some time and nothing I try is helping but this pillow has helped no end. It did feel a little weird at first like my head was tipped too far back but I guess thats because we all sleep with our necks in the wrong position. The instructions say to only use for an hour or two at first which is difficult since you're supposed to sleep on it but one side is less raised than the other so you could always start with the flatter side and then flip it to the more sculpted side once you get used to it. All in all this is worth every penny and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering with neck/shoulder pain."
1,BEWARE - hand-stuffed pillows with no quality control,"I purchased this pillow directly form Arc4Life for my husband and it is great. So there is definitely value to this product and I wanted one for myself. However, all pillows are stuffed by hand, and while I assume there is some type of quality control, such as a standardized weight, the actual product varied TREMENDOUSLY. I received a pillow that was about 5 inches high, so no normal person could ever use it-- my shoulders were raised off of the bed.Unfortunately, arc4life cannot recognize this lack of quality in their product and I was unable to get an exchange on it. I'd say that buying this product is a gamble."
1,arc pillow,"I was really excited to get my pillow! after the first couple nights I woke up with a sore neck, as it warned me. over the next couple weeks, the pain got worse and worse until I had to stop using it. I've now been going to my chiropractor several times a month to help the pain. this pillow made my neck MUCH WORSE."
5,"Excellent, relief at last","This pillow has allowed me to finally get relief from my burning and tingling hand issues due to cervical disk problems. I also have fewer problems during the day now also. If you are having sleeping issues due to neck problems, get this pillow.Very comfortable, and I can seep on back or side, but works best for back sleeping (which I can now do)."
2,Traction pillow,"Pillow is very firm in the neck ""arch"" area and wide- like for a big guy maybe- pillow should come in varied sizes- firmnesses"
2,Did not help,"I have tried many, many pillows over the years hoping for something that will help. This was another one in the collection that failed. I gave it nearly two months.I have loss of C curve, cervical disc herniations and disc degeneration. I think it's going to take more than a pillow to get relief with these problems. It might help with minor loss of C curve, but if you have more than that, don't expect miracles from a pillow."
2,Not happy with it,I bought this in hopes it would help with my herniated c5/c6 disk in my neck. I thought it was overpriced but would pay just about anything to get a good night sleep with my current condition. This pillow sucks. Unless you are very comfortable laying perfectly flat on your back then it is of no use. You can sleep on your side but then its just like a regular pillow thats way too firm. I tried using it for a while and it was too uncomfortable. Im just going to by a tempurpedic.
4,Great Pillow,"I have a slight reverse curve in my neck and routinely get migraines. I purchased this pillow hoping it would help and have been using it for about a month now. At first it made my neck hurt more and made my neck very stiff because my neck was not used to being in that position. After a few days though, it made my neck feel really good. My neck actually hurts more now if I do not use the pillow. We will see how much it helps my headaches long term, since it takes time to work.The one negative I have is that you have to sleep in a particular position for the pillow to work. Yes, you can sleep on your back or either side. However, if you sleep on your right side, you have to sleep on the right side of the pillow (not the center or the left). It is not a big deal, but is a minor inconvenience."
5,BEST PILLOW EVER!,"I have tried dozens of hard foam, mushy memory foam, magnetic, etc. cervical pillows but none of them give me the proper support as this Linear Traction Pillow! It may be a little large for my frame ( 4'11 1/2"") so at times the sides may seem a little high but it still feels better than any other pillow. I can also sleep on my side in the center of the pillow and be perfectly aligned. This pillow is so supportive but soft!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this based on the reviews, as I have had neck muscle stiffness and pain on and off for two years. I have gone through chiro, massage therapy, acupuncture, and it still gets stiff easily. I was hoping this would help, as my memory foam hurt my neck after a while.Well, it may work for you but it just made my neck hurt more. It really wasn't uncomfortable to use, just hard to get used to. I gave it a week because I read about it sometimes causing stiffness in the beginning, but by the end of the week the pain was truly unbearable ... I am returning it."
3,"Good, but contradictory","I read this book after reading Mr. Pope's other book, ""Colleges that Change Lives"". I think this is a much better book, particularly in giving more detailed information on selecting a college in general. The other book was very skimpy on general information and consisted primarily of college profiles.I still have some issues with Mr. Pope's small (some might say tiny) school bias. At least here he provides more background as to why he believes what he believes. And the list of schools (though lacking in any depth), does contain a lot of larger (5000+) schools.If nothing else, Mr. Pope's two books are important -- they were pretty much the first books to take on the ""Ivy League or Bust"" mentality that seemed to mushroom out of control in the 60's and 70's. For that alone he deserves praise -- just take some of his diatribes with a grain of salt."
1,Why set your standards high?,"Speaking as an ivy-league grad myself, I can tell you this book says some untrue things. That being said, my brother, an attendant of a bush-league institution (Duke, pusha... what is that fifth these days? hahaha) told me I ought to read it. If you want your children to set low standards and do poorly, this is the book for you. If you'd like your children to be actual successes with the ability to sit down at an interview with more to say than, ""my college was a good fit,"" then the ivy-league is still your best bet."
3,It's ok for the price,the mailbox is nice especially for the price but it's made of very thin metal that bends easily. Overall it's a good product.
4,A chilling read any time of year,"Ms Booker has hit the mark with this book....has you on the edge of your seat and just when you think.....well, you have to read it yourself. I highly rate this book."
2,"GREAT COMPANY, poorly made product","I bought my first Orbit Aluminum Turret Torch Spray Nozzle #56410 and loved it for about 3 months when the shut off valve broke. Contacted the company and they sent a new one out very quickly no questions asked. The new nozzle lasted about a year and now the shut off valve is broken. Also the ""chrome"" finish peeled off in small pieces over time and now it is really ugly and looks like I might have had it for 10 years instead of one.I will not purchase this product again. I gave it 2 stars as for the few months it lasted I really enjoyed it and the design is a perfect fit for your hand."
1,"Initially subpar, then total fail","Brand new the nozzle worked okay except in ""shower mode"" when the strength of the water stream was highly non-uniform across the different holes. Now, 4 months after purchase, the switch to turn off the nozzle has completely stopped working despite simple moderate use."
5,Better than it looks,"Usually products that offer extra features lack the quality of the regular ones. I was worried about the taste when i ordered this, but is better than what i have thought. Also the spoon idea is really great! No messing around anymore."
4,Great source of motivation and information on the writing process,This book contains almost everything a beginning writer needs to know about a vast number of topics on the writing process. It could also serve as a guidebook for those who are well into a writing career. I love all the quotes and advice from well-know established writers. Their insight gives a human touch to the writing process. I feel that The Writer's Mentor may provide just the push I need to finally sit down and write my first book.
4,JMS all you need is this book,I bought this book because I needed it for a project. If you need a consise and easy to read. It covers all you need to know to write your code this book is for you. There are other books with 600+ pages which cost more $$. It has links to JMS providers that you can use to run the sample code. The code is simple but to the point. I was able to compile the code without much changes. I would have give it 5 if it had one or two more chapters with more advanced samples.
1,SonicMQ marketing broschure,You should better read the JMS spec and the JMS tutorial from the JavaSoft JMS site. This book here is a SonicMQ marketing broschure and nothing more.
4,Good introduction but need some updating to JMS 1.1,"This is a reasonable good book, as you can expect from O'Reilly. There is a good introduction in the topic (e.g. where is Messaging used for, what kind of messaging does exist, what is JMS), and it offers chapters with some practical code how you send and receive messages, and so on. It contains real Java code with excellent explanation.If you're familar with Java, don't know anything of Middleware and JMS, this is a pretty good start. If you read this book, and you play with an free open source JMS implementation (e.g. ActiveMQ), you will soon get things working.*HOWEVER* This book is now arround 5 years old and *ONLY* covers JMS 1.02, where JMS 1.1 is now common.*BUT* the majority of all other JMS books are also 3-5 years old, and some also covers only JMS 1.02.If you keep this in mind, I think this is a pretty good purchase."
1,Genoa,"I was very disappointed with this film I thought the film beneath Colin's capabilities, rather vulgar. It went nowhere and had a really stupid ending, left you feeling - is this all?"
2,Boring,"The theme of loss was potentially interesting as it is something we can all relate to, but the presentation was incredibly boring. It was very repetitive, slow, and boring. The Blair Witch shaky cam shots were also horrible. To give credit where credit is due, Firth did his usual stellar job, but he had so little to work with. His character was also a little pathetic, so there wasn't much to like. I found myself saying over and over, ""Is this over yet?"" When the credits finally rolled, I was relieved to see it end but disappointed that I invested so much time. The finale was very unsatisfying."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"I was looking forward to yet another intelligent Colin Firth film, but this one was too obtuse for me. The pace was so slow that the last 10 minutes seemed like 30.One bonus of watching a film set in another country is that one gets to enjoy the foreign experience vicariously and to see beautiful vistas, but not in this film. The lighting was terrible. The actors were often filmed in shadow in dark interiors or alleys. I am sure the director did this on purpose to echo the darkness in the souls of the three grieving characters, but somewhere around 30 minutes into the film I didn't care. I perfectly understand why this film was never shown in theaters and went straight to DVD."
4,Good for Older ESOL Students,I teach ESOL and these books are great for teaching reading while providing age appropriate material. It is quite reassuring that there are books that ESOL students can find interesting.
2,A Very Bad Well-Written Book,"Oh Miss Becnel. She knows her art very well indeed - watch her make medieval life positively aglow with colour, from the harshness of the life during those times to the colour of the language.Having said that, after so many tortured turnings and plot mechanisms I wanted to grab a sword myself and skewer the silly man of a hero and the annoying heroine. He keeps insisting on marrying well for political advantages yet is not above forcing his attentions on her. She is intelligent but is totally ninnyhammery when it comes to him. After all the hardships he put her through, when she tells herself she still loves him, I want to run her with a sword myself. Anything for the book to end.I never did know I have such violent tendencies!"
4,Love Wins Between Two Enemies!,"Enemies attracted to each other, trying to deny the attraction. Differences to overcome, history to overcome, struggles and more struggels. Good story throughout with love winning in the end. The intimacy shared between the main characters was erotic and moving. The book was a good read, I look forward to the next in the series."
3,Not as good as her others,"I have read three other books by Ms Becnel and loved them. This one was just okay. I would not read it again. I got alittle tired or Rand(y)'s almost constant state or arousal when Josselyn was around. Sure he admired her intellect, her loyalty, her spirit, but that lust was almost always the driving force. And Josselyn's constant--I shouldn't want him. He's my enemy. I hate him. But...--got tiresome. If it had not been by Ms Becnel, I might not even have given the book a three. Do I want to bother with the second story? I doubt it. I did not even like the character Rhonwen. Rhys and Jasper seemed okay, but Rhonwen irritated me. I'll try her again, but I'll heed other readers comments first."
4,Old fashion living with the romance of today,"My Girlfriend and I bought this book and decided to discover ""what romance novels are like."" Our thoughts were that they would be a cheep story to introduce sex. I was wrong. I mean sex is in the book, but it was presented in a tastfull way, not the best, but nice. Not a bad read. Pages went swiftly by!"
5,Excellent entertainment,"I grew up watching this series, and the only part about it that disappointed me is that there were not more seasons available apart from season one. The best sketch is watching Ryan in ""Party Quirks"" be a ""Foal being born"". Excellent for anyone who wants a good belly laugh."
5,Brilliant DVD from a Brilliant Show,"So, I am an unashamed fan of this epic TV show - so this review may be a little giddy with happiness that the seasons are starting to roll out on DVD.But I will endeavour to stick to form and evaluate the DVD being presented.This DVD presents season 1 of the american version of ""Whose Line is It Anyway"", I don't fully agree with other reviews there that say this season is weaker than later seasons. This is from the same producing team that created the British version that ran for many years. Although Drew Carey does improve as a presenter in later seasons!The DVD has a few extra bits on it that show outtakes and stuff that never made it to air. My favourite is when we get to see the between the takes footage. The performers making fun of the producing team etc.This is one of the only DVD series I would buy without even seeing the quality of them. But it really is a great start to hopefully a full collection of this epic TV show."
1,average john doe,Still waiting to receive the cd..... Told it's still on back order. Never again shall I order item thru this sight....
2,Blind Climb,"This is a nice story about a blind man who climbed Mount Everest. But, a better DVD of this climb is the documentary called, ""Farther than the Eye can See"". It is so much better to see the real thing. He and his dad are amazing people. Buy it."
5,Back with a vengeance.,"Paris is back bustin on the government and the hip hop industry. The intro, Ave Bushani is a classic, considering the ""omen"" like singing in the background in reference to our great(yeah right) leader. My favorite cuts are Sheep to the Slaughter, because of his reference to everyone who is pro war yet isn't fighting, especially the ARNOLD Schwarzenneger reference which rings truer now, Ain't No Love with Kam, Lay Low because he is speaking from the heart, especially about Hip Hop in the lastverse, man that gets me hyped, and AWOL, because it is true. This CD is definitely a classic. PEACE"
1,Garbage,"Sent RUSTED parts, they were all rust red and about to break from such a poor condition. Holes weren't pre-drilled. This is a piece of garbage, don't buy."
3,"ok, but the wrong screws came with it, and if you are not careful you will ruin the table top","Some of the screws were too long and screwing the horizontal part to the top resulted in the screw going all the way through the top. Be careful to hold the screws up to the pieces that they go in so that you wont have the same issue that i did. After ruining the small part of the table, I was able to work out a way of only using the larger part of the table top."
5,What I have been looking for!!,"I had ordered this and received today from Bed, Bath & Beyond. It is beautiful and solid. I wasn't sure after reading the reviews how sturdy it would be and was prepared to make a trip to Home Depot for hardware. But the hardware that came with this unit was far superior. It was built in 10 mins with no issues. I have the table flat so it does not tilt since I have a larger desktop replacement laptop. And I used a small soft towel under the fan of my laptop so not to scratch up the finish. My only complaint is the table is not a little longer. Would had liked to have room for my Belkin N52te. :)"
3,almost a western,"This books is essentially a western only it takes place in a weird surreal landscape that is being ripped apart by these horrible demon creatures. The action scenes are downright brilliant, and characters are great. But the landscape he created just bored me. And that's one of the things I love most about westerns is the landscape. Theres a town filled with people with television heads and that's just cheesy. Still, it's a good read. Highly erotic."
5,Graeme Connors review,"OK, I do NOT own this ""CD"" yet,but, I do have the MP3's ofthis recording though, and I love every song !!![....]"
3,Rather incomplete.,"It's an interesting glance-thru, but the projects are out-of-scope for most people and require buying supplies from the publisher."
3,Not the Best! Going Back To Escort!,"I've owned this detector for a year now and I have just decided to sell it and go back to an Escort Model. The only reason I gave up the Escort Passport model was because I lived in Va and needed stealth because detectors are illegal in Va. The problem with the theory is that the STI Driver does NOT have anywhere near the ability of the Passport. Many times by the time I received the warning on the Driver I was already looking straight at the cop. Useless. Several times it also seemed like it completely failed to recognize a threat at all! Again useless. And as a side note, the amount of false alarms I received with the Driver on ANY setting was ridiculous.Very annoying and distracting. The only positive feature I can say about it is of course its stealth ability - yes you have it BUT at a big cost. And I am not referring to the price. I've decided to to take my money from the sale of this and to go back to Escort. Good Luck!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,"This gnome measures 6 inches high by 11 inches long, not the 14 inches as the description indicates. I was expecting a much larger gnome. I order frequently from Amazon and have never been disappointed whether ordering books or other items. This is certainly not work $29 even with free shipping. I would not recommend this purchase to anyone."
4,Great Product,After taking this product for one week I saw a marked improvement in my weight loss. Even when I cheated on my diet I still lost more weight than I did before.
3,I am still trying to lose weight,I not only have a thyroid issue but am extremely overweight. I just ordered my second bottle. I have trouble sticking to my diet- I love food and can't get enough of it. I seem to have a food addiction which is sad because my health is on the line. I will continue to take this because I believe I need a thyroid stimulator.
3,Thyrotrill,"no change in my energy level or in weight loss. It did make me go to the bathroom more, not constipated anymore."
1,Rip Off,This was the biggest waste of money. This product does not work and I was totally disappointed. I followed the directions on the bottle and did not lose any weight. Total rip-off.
4,Gave my thyroid the boost it needed!,I am tremendously happy with the results of Thyrotril. My thyroid came to what seemed like a screeching halt. I couldn't stop gaining weight diet and exercise alone wasn't doing it for me. My personal trainer recommended Thyrotril so I decided to give it a try and I'm real happy I did because like I said I am tremendously happy with the results. I highly recommend it especially to people such as myself with an inactive thyroid.
4,This helped my thyroid get a boost,I really like this product. I feel it helped me with my inactive thyroid. I was diagnosed with.
2,Umm....,"Is anyone else disgusted by how the hero practically rapes the heroine? Usually, I don't mind the domineering attitude of Brown's characters but I found that just a little disturbing. Actually, a lot of bit disturbing."
3,Not As Advertised,The tracks on this album do not match what is on the film there are bits in there that I do not recognise and I have watched the film so many times I am nearly word perfect. So if you are looking for a match don't buy this CD
1,not working anymore,it just got stock moving continuously to the right and won't move to any other side!
3,Poetry that makes learning history fun,I spend a lot of time looking for quality literature about historical events that is appropriate for the younger reader. Mrs. Livingston is a celebrated poet who has really found her niche. Her style of poetry is just right for this subject.
4,shih tzu book,"This is a very informative book. Geared more toward the show dog owner, but has information useful to the pet dog owner, too.Many great photos.I am sure we will refer to it often as we raise our new Shih Tzu."
1,"Once gold, now garbage","I have been using Roboform for more years than I can remember, and have found it intuitive and idispensable. But no longer. Much commentary focuses on the fact that Siber Systems has broken its promise of free lifetime upgrades by charging for v.7. This is a valid complaint and, if anyone is going to start a class action suit, count me in.But even setting that aside, (I paid for 7), Roboform 7 is useless junk.1) There is no way to direct what folder passcards should be stored it.2) There is no way to direct it to the folder in which I have hundreds of stored passcards from v.6 or earlier.3) Even with v.6 or earlier, every time I went to the Roboform site for an update it would try to sell me another one of severel otherutilities, all of which had bad user reviews.4) Support has always been nonexistent.Bottom line: Spread the word and let's all do our best to put Siber systems out of business and hopefully in jail."
1,"Beware, if you switch from PC to Mac...","You have to buy Roboform Everywhere if you want to use your existing passcodes on a Mac. OK that's only $10 more. No big deal. Be warned though, the process of syncing the passcodes on your PC with Roboform Everywhere on your Mac is a trainwreck. This software is just not ready for primetime. I can't believe they're trying to pawn this off as a Mac solution. Don't waste your time like I have. Roboform Everywhere is Roboform Nightmare if you are trying to get you existing passcodes installed on a Mac."
2,No what I was expecting.,This book was in a worse state than described. You need to refine your descriptions.However that being said I only want it for a reference copy.
1,Vanguard Saga of Heroes,"The first copy I received the CD key was already being used, so I had to send it back for another. The game still has a few bugs, which can be annoying, but its still playable. Overall I was not impressed and I did not want to continue to play after the first free month."
2,Probably fun on a brand new top of the line computer,"I've managed to get three characters through the first few levels, and I want to like this game. It has a lot of interesting race and class choices, the world really is massive, and the crafting and diplomacy spheres seem like they could be fun.But I can juuust barely run this thing. I have a pretty decent computer, not exactly cutting edge, but for example I can run Oblivion without much problem. I've dialed down the graphic settings but I still get tons of lag, and it's gotten bad enough on several occasions that I just give up and play WoW instead (which runs perfectly.)It's early yet, maybe these problems can be ironed out. If you don't have the game yet and you don't have a REALLY good computer with a top of the line graphics card, I'd say hold off on this for now."
4,Vanguard Saga of Heroes,vanguard saga of heroes is a good game want's you get passed the begininglovels. there are some diplomatict quest's if you like that sort of thingthe realausem of cuting down trees his great the overall game is goodbut the only draw back is that it is done by SOE.
5,Underrated Book,"The Golden Age of the Moor remains one of the best books written that talks solely about the Moors, their origins, and the advances they made in Spain. This book is pro-Moor. It doesn't talk about slavery, the Inquisition, etc. It's made to clearly show the impact Moorish culture had on Europe. Meaning this is a rare book, because very few come from this angle. As one studies the Inquisition, and many books written on it, you'll notice that many authors sweep the ethnicity of the Moors completely under the rug. Either that, or they'll write them off as Berbers (a language group consisting of numerous different clans and groups). There is no other book that comes to mind that shows how deep the Moorish influence was. My copy is worn out after so much use, this is a very underrated book though."
5,The best rocking baby to sleep cd ever,"Love, love, love this lullabye music. I used to rock my niece to this music, and then both my sons. They still listen to it every night at bedtime and they are 7 and 4. It makes a great gift! You will memorize the words and they will become a family tradition. Buy it!"
2,Electronic amplifications ruin these !,"Not my cup of tea. Songs too cutsie, swingy and electronically modified from the original acoustic sound. I don't know whether baby might like it; he won't be given a chance to listen to it."
5,Not the Tonya Goodman Sykes CD,"These lullabyes are beautiful, so no penalty of a lower rating from me. BUT, if you are buying this as a gift (or a replacement for a worn out CD or cassette that's been listened to so much it's worn out) & you have the Tanya Goodman CD, go look for the more expensive version. This $9 version is ""varoius artists."" If you haven't listened to this CD before, then this version is probably fine. But if you love the Tanya Goodman-only version, then find the $23 CD & get that one. It takes extra time & extra $, but it's worth it. I can't imagine listening to these lullabyes sung by anyone but her."
5,Wonderfully Lovely,"I guarantee that these beautiful soothing lullabyes will ease even the fussiest of babies to sleep. I particularly like that there are instrumental versions of each of the songs, so that you can add your own voice to these night time melodies. My sixteen year old daughter still smiles when we bring this out to listen to them. These songs are a part of her and her infant years. I know someday in the future she will be singing these to her babies as well. Wonderful for your baby and perfect as a gift!"
5,Wonderful Lullabyes!,A Child's Gift of Lullabyes was given to me as a gift in cassette tape form when I had my baby daughter. Now she is a teenager and we still love these songs. For me they also bring back those special babyhood days. We lost the tape so decided to replace it with a CD and continue to enjoy it. Makes a great baby gift!
4,Canon PowerShot,This was a really good purchase. Very pleased with the camera and was VERY pleased with the accessory kit.
4,Can a Police Procedural be cozy?,"Chicago cop Suze Figueroa and her partner Norm Bennis exchange witty repartee in their squad car, but Figueroa longs to be a detective. Her chance arrives when the detective squad is felled by a bad dinner date. She and Bennis take on a serial killer while balancing their other cases and working within the confines of the city budget and their own time limitations.Figueroa and Bennis are characters transported from a British cozy to the mean streets of Chicago, given some absolutely delightful dialogue and a fine-tuned sense of justice, and set loose to wreak havoc on the bad guys. She and Bennis come down to the wire in solving one crime, while another is taking place right in Figueroa's home.D'Amato takes a solid plot, compelling characters, and an exciting location, and sprinkles in some terrifying antagonists to make ""Authorized Personnel Only"" a great read."
4,These socks feel great and very comfortable.,"I've been looking for a nice pair of these for a while to wear with my Vibram Five Fingers for light hiking. I have previously been using a thicker sock from a trip to Japan that have been nice for the added comfort but are pretty think and don't have a lot of breath-ability.I tried these on when they came and they feel great, I was surprised how light they feel but I've only had the thicker ones of my own to compare them too. They seem sturdy enough and felt comfortable on all my toes. I am around a size 12.5 shoe, but usually wear a 13. Got the large size as they ranged from 11 - 13 and it fits fine. Only if you were 14 would I suggest the XL.Hopefully I can update this after a few short hikes."
5,Fits Like a Glove!!,"I bought the socks to help with keeping my toes from rubbing against each other when I walk. I walk a lot living in NYC.So far so great!! I hand wash them each night and so far, standing strong. VERY happy with this product and I WILL be buying more, though so far, haven't had to buy a new pair!! And are MY toes happy!!!"
3,"Product fine, fullfillment not","Amazon prices used to be competitive with brick & motarretailers on these bars. Now, I use AMZN only for flavorsunavailable locally.But the big problem is shipping. The order included somewatch batteries, which AMZN refuses to ship to a PO Box.So during warm months, bars arrive as a melted mess."
5,The Author is My Highschool English Teacher,"As my title says, Dr. William K. Klingaman was my 11th grade AP American History teacher, and is currently my AP English 12 teacher. The book itself I had used as a source to write a huge paper on Lincoln in 10th grade, which took the whole year. Well, it was endlessly useful. Im fact, the paper earned me a 93- no small feat considering how difficult a class it was. Then 11th grade came, and I realised that I had quoted my future Social Studies teacher. A fabulous teacher, I might add. Witty, great sense of humor, interesting lecturer. He gives THE hardest multiple choice tests a person could ever take, though. ;-)"
1,WHY ISN'T IT CORELLE WARE?,MELTS NEAR HEAT.DUH.....IT'S A SPOON REST TO BE USED NEAR A STOVE!WHY ISN'T MADE OF CORELLE LIKE THE REST OF MY COLLECTION.VERY CHEESY LOOKING....ESPECIALY NOW THAT IT IS CHARRED ON BOTH SIDES.
2,Uninspired music from the King,"Wow, I cannot believe that so many people have called this a great KD album.....believe me when I say it is not! I am a big KD fan, and love most of his work, except this album. King focuses too much on the lyrics and the story, leaving the music in the background, with no memorable hooks or riffs, throughout the album I feel as if king is reading a book with music supporting him....this is what distinguishes his albums, the music. Abigail and Conspiracy where great because the story supported the music, not the other way around.Buy this cd at your own risk...I did, and it was a big dissapointment."
2,A downswing for the wildly erratic Elizabeth Moon,"There almost seems to be two Elizabeth Moons - the subtle author of _Remnant Population_ and the inept hack of the Serrano novels. _Once a Hero_ was a pleasant surprise - whenever the Altiplano elements appeared in the novel, it shone, and the Fleet bits were innocuous enough to not weigh down the rest. _Rules of Engagement_ reverts to form, unfortunately. The few good bits (the Landsbride sequence) failed to redeem an otherwise awful story. Can we please retire the evil-patriarchal-religious-fanatic trope now? It's the worst kind of bigotry, and makes for a very tired sort of conflict. Also, a certain tendency in recent space opera usually labelled David Weber Syndrome or ""We-Love-Honor!"" runs rampant in this book. Secondary characters should have lives, agendas, and concerns that do not all revolve around the protagonist. Moon is capable of much more."
1,Making Sense of Change Management,The book is way too superficial and it seems to be more on a psychological aspect and reaction of change towards human and the dynamic of response from it...Basically cause and effect reaction and resistance force from a human point of view...
3,An Italian Nunsploitation Epic,"The Sinful Nuns of Saint Valentine is yet another interesting release from the Redemption line of Image Entertainment. An Italian nunsploitation epic in which a demented Mother Superior and a rabid collection of mentally disturbed and sex-crazed sisters lose their habits and morals with equal gusto. Inspired in part by 'The Devils of Loudon,' this is a classic of the genre. Definetly not for the casual viewer, but well worth the time for genre fans."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY !,"What a total waste of time.This is one of the worst movies of all time.Don't be decieved by the title,it's not what you think it is.The movie is 94 mins long and 90 of those minutes is a bunch of guys swordfighting and a group of priests talking...and talking...and talking,I think you get the point.If you are expecting what I think you are then save your money!"
4,Good quality tools,"I had just bought my Weber One-Touch Silver and I needed some tools to go with my new grill. Sure, I already had a cheap grill before the Weber, and some tools (very cheap and crappy) but what better to go with my new Weber grill then Weber tools? I decided on this set. This three-piece set comes with the usual... A spatula, a two-prong fork and some tongs. All of them are attractive and have a rubber material on the handles to keep hands nice and cool. The price is just about right at $30 but I was lucky to find a new set for $20. The spatula and fork are nice and hefty, they feel quite durable. The tongs on the other hand feel slightly cheaper and a little bit on the thin side. By no means are the tongs poor quality, they just don't feel quite as tough as the other tools. On the upside, the tongs are spring loaded and have a cool locking mechanism. Overall I recommend these tools to anyone in need of them!"
5,great tools!,Got these for my husband for Father's Day...the tools are GREAT! The handles are sturdy. My husband loves them!
2,Stuck again,"I love the style of these Weber tools. However, the tongs get stuck all the time. It must just be the set that I recieved because this is my second set and the first ones for our other house are fine. Just be aware of the challenge."
4,There is something down there,"you see them walking around and you've wondered where they go at night or come from.""The Mole People"" the whole story will tell you.Underneth the subways of NY, this is the story of the people down there,like way down there,some for more than 10 years.The scenes are real the location scary and the story compelling.It's a must see ""The Mole People"" there out there"
3,An easy to read primer into electric cars,"A generally good book that's a gives solid overview of what's involved in building an electric car. Armed with this book and plenty of motivation I'm sure you'd be able to pull of the build of your green shocker.However this book was let down by the consistent evangelically tone. And the chapters of waffle and filler around the history of the electric car. I bought this book a guide to building, I not too interested in reading about the past. I skipped around a third of the book."
2,"Good, but outdated","This well written, engaging book was written in 1994, and badly needs to be updated. The technologies have changed (batteries, motors, controllers), the candidates for cars to convert have changed (for example, you need to be very careful with the computer-driven dashboards and controls of most cars built in the past 8-10 years), and the assumptions about oil prices, electricity prices, and the global energy picture have changed.It is a little shocking that this book (and Michael Brown's Convert It, published in 1993 and not upbdated) are the only ones available for this exciting, rapidly changing field."
3,"Not Bad - a little dated, but better than most","Compared to my other review on the book: ""Convert It."", this book is much better - at least it's a real ""paperback""! The material is more up to date, however it is still somewhat dated. The newer controller chips available, tranformer technologies and battery technologies are described in a forward looking way... however these items are now easily available - so the book doesn't address them very well, they weren't reality at the time. Still a good read to get a comparison of different concepts. Your money might be better spent doing research on the pricey, but high tech Tesla Motors car. There is 2007 technology at work!"
4,Great but could have been better,"Much is used from the first edition. I have noticed typos, which seems strange but they don't seem to be too critical. This book is really great for learning how to do a conversion. Don't expect too many details on specific how-to topics like battery ventilation or component mounting; of course you should have the ability to be creative in those somewhat non-critical areas. This is a book where a picture is worth a thousand words and I think color photos would have been a nice touch when looking at engine bays. Overall its great to have updated info over the first edition, yet it is still limited to lower-end hobbyist conversions."
4,blue tooth headphone,This is the bluetooth device I have ever had. For the past three years I have used the Sony headset with great satisfaction and it comes with great sadness that Sony stopped making them. Its fit behind the ear and lightweight makes it fit snugly and comfortably and will not fall off no matter what direction you lean. There's no other bluetooth I'd rather have.
2,SubStandard,"This bluetooth is comfortable, light weight and the clarity is good. The only problem is that if your phone is more than 1 foot from the bluetooth, it will static like crazy!!!!! This is the worst distance I have ever experienced!"
3,I am the first to give this only 3 stars,"I enjoyed the family saga that is portrayed in the novel but that is as far as it goes. The novel is not at all historically accurate in that in the 1940's the characters speak of African American's as ""blacks"" and speak of racism. These terms were NOT used in 1940 America. Blacks were called negroes and nigras. So the book does not get 5 stars since it does not ring true historically. Also, introducing Martin Luther King at a civil rights rally as a young man in 1940 Mississippi is also highly inaccurate. I doubt that there were civil rights rallies in 1940. So based on the lack of historical accuracy and inaccurate speech patterns in this book, I can not give this novel more than 3 stars. Read it for the interesting family story but nothing more."
5,It arrived on time,I purchased life force organic soil mix potting soil not too long ago 2 plant my fruits vegetables and herbs out of the back yard the plants sprouted quick ! I will purchase more in the future .
5,Does well!,"Most plants should do well in this soil. Not to mention it's easy on your pocket. I think it ships from the western US, so it took me some time to get it in the mail, but I was in no hurry. Good product- no tears in bags or any inconveniences :)"
1,Another Rip-Off of a Great Series!,"I was about to purchase this book the other day at Books-A-Million but once I looked at the Copyright info I put it back on the shelf. I have all of the Bolo series that the Great Author Keith Lamar did, I couldn't wait for another one to be released. I fell in Love with the series and could relate with how some of the Bolos felt about their brothers and sisters. I am a 25 yr US Army and US Air Force Combat Vet (Nam to the Gulf and a lot in be tween.)This book is a rip-off of your hard earned cash! Only two stories were new the rest were just older re-prints. Publishers should never allow things like this to happen.Save your money until they only print ""NEW"" stories!GerryB45"
1,Major design flaw,"The inside liner of these shoes uses a material that acts like Velcro or terrycloth. This is an epic flaw. How did this material choice make it to production? If you wear these in the outdoors (like they were designed for) then your liners will quickly get embedded with grass, straw, sawdust, etc. Basically anything that you would come in contact with if you were camping. I wrecked my shoes camping for two days. I tried using tape and tweezers to pick the stuff out of the liner but it would take hours to clean these shoes up."
1,Very disappointed!,"After a problem getting my order to go through, I opened the box to find I had been sent used shoes. The soles were dirty, the pull tabs on the back of the shoes had been ripped off and the inside of the shoes were dirty! I guess this don't rate the shes, but the seller? Amazon gave me 20.00 for my trouble, but I needed those shoes for a trip out west. They have my money tied up and cannot get them before I leave. What were you thinking selling used shoes? You lost me as a customer!"
4,My low and high top ventilators need replacement laces! Where?,"My shoes are fantastic, I've gotten great wear and comfort from both of them, the high and low tops, but they need the black and gold replacement shoe laces! Does anyone know where I can get them! Thank you!"
1,design flaw causes tear after little use,"Great shoes except that it has a major design flaw. After very mild usage, I noticed a tear developing on the gray rubber/ leather interface towards the front inside of the shoe. For my first pair, I thought when it happened that perhaps I had bad luck buying the pair that failed quality inspection. So after the pair fully ripped so that I couldn't use the shoe anymore, I bought a second pair, thinking it wouldn't happen again. Guess what, it started happening again exactly as before. This is really unfortunate, since this pair of shoes would have otherwise received 5 stars. I would highly recommend you purchase a different brand, so that you don't buy a pair of hiking shoes every year."
4,Moab Ventilators via Amazon,"Men's Merrell Moab VentilatorHad to get one whole size larger than my normal shoe, but having done that, these are great walking shoes for living here in the Rockies at 8,500 feet above sea level.I have Merrell hiking boots (also one size larger) and some Merrell waterproof Polartec cleated slip-on shoes (that should have been one size larger)for getting the newspaper and blowing the driveway on snowy mornings. All work well. My original Merrell hiking boots from 20 years ago wore out climbing fourteeners."
5,Hiking Boot,Very comfortable. Broke in easily. First hike with the boots and went for 5 miles and never hurt my feet. Also had very good traction on the mountain. Very good desert boot for hiking.
4,"Great Shoe, Except...","One of the best shoes I've ever owned, and I wish I could give it five stars, except the inner lining is beginning to wear out, I believe way too soon. Yes, I've owned it for the better part of a year, but everybody I spoke with swore these would last a decade. I'm not so sure of that. Nonetheless, a great shoe and I'm sure I'll be purchasing more Merrell shoes in the future."
5,Best Summer hikers,"I have had these for two years now, exclusively using them for hiking during weekends. Conquered highpoints in Maine, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, with these hikers. I have flat feet and am over 600 miles deep with these shoes. Never once did I get blisters, never rolled my ankle, and hiked around twenty miles a day in comfort and luxury! Great warm weather hikers!"
2,Twirl??,Yes- Hollywood did its best with this movie but it really is fun to watch. I twirled for ten years and my coach was actually Blair's baton twirling double. Plus alot of extra padding. It isn't realistic but thats what movies are about.
1,Not realistic at all,"I'm not quite sure exactly what the other reviewer was trying to say (are you even sure your facts are correct?), but this movie is absolutely NOT realistic at all. I've been involved with competitive baton twirling for over 10 years as competitor, coach and judge, and saw nothing in this movie that even remotely related to actual twirling competitions I've been in or to. I do like watching it on occasion, though, because there are a few spots with good twirling - obviously the work of cast members and extras other than the stars. Competitive baton twirling does have its fair share of stage and soccer moms, but is a recognized sport in the AAU - not the modeling-type beauty pagent gone wrong protrayed in this movie. Watch it only if you want to have a good laugh and see some ""stars"" before they were known."
3,Decent Entertainment,"Overall I found this a good read though I really think it would have been much better dramatically edited and condensed - some of the passages I had to skim/skip through as I got tired of their silliness. I liked very much the main character and her true love, and a couple others as well, and Burney provided a little bit of reflection on human nature, ethics and pretension, most notably to me how important Cecilia's own conscience was to her. There were many interesting historical elements, and I enjoyed the explanatory notes."
1,Not what I ordered...,"I originally ordered a U-8 USB cord for a Kodak Easy Share C643, but received a U-5. I called the company to get instructions for an exchange, did everything I was told, but only received a refund (minus shipping x 2). I have tried to get in contact with Adorama Camera, but to no avail. This is not at all what it should've been."
5,wonderful,"I loved this book. It is sad, funny and entertaining all rolled into one. I am looking forward to her next book. I liked it so much that I got several copies for my friends."
4,Good enough to use as a reference.,"The author did a great job of presenting the relatively basic information on configuring Cisco routers. You will find quite a few useful IOS commands discussed in the book that will want to keep it as a handy reference. I would also suggest looking into getting ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton. That book would take you deeper into mechanics of modern routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP), along with a discussion of Cisco IOS commands."
3,Long shipping time,"I ordered in January and got the Feburry issue at the end of February. A few days later, got the March issue. Had to call to extend the expiration date. Good luck. Otherwise, the magazine's content is as expected."
4,Correction about item description,"I recently bought this item from Amazon. In the description of the DVD's it says the aspect ratio is 1.85 which is letterbox format. Three of the movies are letterbox, but one isn't. The Eiger Sanction is 2.35, which is widescreen. If, like me, you do not like widescreen movies this could be a problem. I thought of returning the set, but overall it is a good deal at a good price and decided to keep it. The other 3 movies are some of Eastwood's best early works."
3,"Most information is useful. Slightly disorganized, which causes a very slow read.","Overall the book presents all the information you need to start using make - which is a lot of information. However, the writing style used when he's presenting sections that are supposed to be ""follow along"", leave a lot of holes and become tedious to figure out.There's also a lot of ""but we'll touch on that later"" - which puts you in the position of having to read through a part, knowing that he'll explain something better later in the book, which will for the moment, leave you wondering what it is he's talking about. Unfortunately he does this a lot, even right in the middle of a follow along example. Arg.I give it three stars because there aren't any other make books on make. This book does cover a lot of information and will definitely help you get started with make. Just don't expect to breeze through it without re-reading pieces of it 5 or 6 times. And definitely make sure you look at the errata for corrections."
3,Be cautious about using this product INSTEAD OF surge protectors on sensitive electronic equipment,"I have recently reviewed several manufacturer's online sites for this kind of device, and believe every site said to use this kind of device to protect the motors in your house--AND also to use individual surge protectors on your sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and sound systems."
2,a real dud,The clock setting mechanism did not work. It just goes around a dizzying pace. The speaker does work though.
5,I take it with me everywhere,"I have been using Skype for almost a year and have purchased a number of wireless and cordless phone options. By far, this has been the most useful especially at my desk.The sound it great and it works well connected to my PC."
1,Obsolete,"Only correctly works with Windows XP - how laughable. Even more absurd is Polycom support's communication regarding this laziness forcing regular users to secretly upload beta versions of Vista drivers to RapidShare in order to help other people try and get this to work. Also, (obviously I guess) echo cancellation only works with Skype. If there ever was a one-trick pony, this is it."
1,Absolute pile of ****,"It doesn't work. At all. I have spent upwards of 15 solid hours installing, uninstalling, reinstalling, updating firmware, upgrading and downgrading between versions of Skype, all on two different computers with different versions of Windows, just to be sure it wasn't me. Oh, and waiting days for Polycom's lame customer service to reply to my emails.I should have realized what I was letting myself in for when the installation CD came up with a dialog box telling me it couldn't find the file to start the install (turns out they set the autorun to the wrong path, so you have to navigate through the CD's contents and find it yourself. That shows you just how little attention has been paid to getting this product right).AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
2,Granfa Grig had a pig,"This book did not match expectations as advertised. It had many stains, taped pages,worn book cover edges. I hoped to cherish this book and use it as an inspiration for painting as my mother has used hers for many years. This book was a disappointment to me."
2,Misleading Title,More psycho-clinical than spiritual. Not what I expected given the Title of the book. Also could be confusing to someone new in sobriety.
1,symbolism of the tarot,"This book was vague and I felt that it was not revelant to tarot. It was way to philosphical and it left me a feeling of incompleteness and not much understanding of the symbols of tarot.it was almost paganist in nature and detached from trying to understand tarot better. For example, the way we look at the devil card now in reading tarot, the book description was completely opposite in interpreting it for our readings. It referred back to how it was viewed back in old times and did not help me to interpret now. Luckily I only paid $1.00 for it."
4,Quiet Bizarro?,"A lot of people's perception of Bizarro is that it's like Excel Saga, but written by junkies and dripping with gore, that it's either Bloodsucking Bimbos from Burbank or Naked Lunch 2: Nakeder Lunch. Sea of the Patchwork Cats, along with, say, the works of Andersen Prunty, prove that this is not always the case. Sea is thought-provoking and full of icy existential chills. The first few chapters are stark poetry that sets up a world without answers. It reminds us that Bizarro is first foremost, a literature of strangeness and otherness and the microwave powered sex cartoons are merely one end of the spectrum. I don't know if I liked this koan as much as I like the microwave powered sex cartoons (which are usually intense and brilliant) but it represents the weird' s potential for beauty and versatility and I'm all for that."
2,Original much better than the remixes,"I'm very disappointed in Remixes from the Underground. A few remixes are good--the first few on the CD. Then it's mostly downhill. The remix of ""The Same Dream"" is horrible. This was especially disapppointing because the original is terrific."
5,Completes the set,"Along with the MugsChantal Ceramic 15-Ounce Tulip Mug, Semi-Gloss Garden Green, Set of 4and the teapotChantal 24-Ounce Tea Pot, Red(choose your colors) makes a complete set and qualifies for free shipping. Lovely Xmas gifts!"
2,Evil Genius will never need this book,"I personanlly nothing wrong with the content, but the book title is misleading. This book is for student with no hands-on experience AT ALL, that is way too,too,too simple! The hand-drawing of schematic diagram make me think this is the book back to the 80's where computer tools were not available.This book may be ok to absolute beginner.However, if you have ever constructed any circuit before, even just on vero board, this book will never ever help you. To me, ""Practical Electronics for Inventor"" provide more useful information to beginner."
3,Review of Electronic Circuits for the Evil Genius,"A very interesting book, but I was disappointed with the fact that I could not make a printed copy (It is DMR protected)As there are many circuitry sketches requiring reference back to accompanying text, it would be much easier to do this from a hard copy of the book. As I have purchased the book surely I should be able to do this!5 stars if I could!!!"
2,Very disappointed,"I have read most of the books in this series and they all suffer from the same problems. They are full of errors that could have been corrected before release if the publisher hired a proofreader. This book is especially frustrating with poor graphics, charts, and tables. You can find some corrections to the text if you search the web. Do not purchase components from the source listed in the book (they are extremely overpriced)."
5,Better than I expected,"I didn't expect the round portion of this cable to be as heavy as it is. I assumed it was made out of plastic or something. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is made out of a nice, heavy, solid rubber material. Helps it stay put on my desk."
3,nice work,Andy has some really beautiful compositions and his player skills are right on par. smoothtouch@onthebreez.com
3,Not Andy at his best!,"Well, it is definitely Andy Narrell, but not his best. A bit too much of the same as before, but missing some of the spark and input from islanders which could be seen on his albums with David Rudder etc. Not bad, but still waiting for Andy to produce something ""new"" and inspired!"
3,Good for classrooms,"I use this in my classroom every year. It does a good job of introducing life at that time, periods of Shakespeare's life, the theatre of the time, and a few of the other poets (including the rivalry between the poets). The acting and narration are okay, but not great. The ""cast"" and ""acting"" are repetitive. For example, a scene used to illustrate Romeo and Juliet is later used to illustrate Shakespeare and his mistress. It is good at a high school level to supplement other introductory materials, but it would be too basic for a college level, and it can't stand on its own. I like this enough to upgrade my VHS (that I have been using for 9 years) to a DVD for my classes."
1,Awful,"This is an amateurish, poorly produced documentary about Shakespeare. Maybe it was a class project for a video class."
5,Works great,I have used this to treat some older boots with cracked leather and no longer waterproof. After treating there was a noticeable improvement in the softness of the leather. I have not used a lot in real wet conditions but they appear to be waterproof again.
1,Very Diisappointed!!!,"I wanted to purchase this CD, because it contained my favorite Joseph Spencer's classic hit of the early 70s, ""Good Morning Mr. Walker"" that made him an international musical sensation in the '60s and '70s, but alas, I was very disappointed that upon hearing a little snipet of the version of ""Good Morning Mr. Walker,"" on the CD via Amazon's Media Player, I decided against purchasing it. I was wondering as to why Spencer did not put the original studio-recorded version of ""Good Morning Mr. Walker"" on this CD. Surely, there are still original record player/gramophone/records or cassette copies of the original ""Good Morning Mr. Walker,"" somewhere on the planet, that Joe Spencer could have reproduced digitally on this CD. The current version on this CD appears to be very amatuerish and gruffly. Until the original studio-recorded version of ""Good Morning Mr. Walker"" is reproduced, purchasing any music or CD from Joseph Spencer will be an exercise in futility on my part."
4,"Disney`s ""Jumping Ship""","The lead actors are three brothers in real life working together in an action filled story. Having gone on a private boat cruise, Michael and Tommy (played by Joseph and Andrew Lawrence, respectively) find themselves being chased by a group of criminals. Forced to abbandon their boat, they and the owner of the boat (their cruise guide, played by Matthew Lawrence) jump off of it, and swim over to a small uninhabited island. It`s fun...with good music...and, with a tropical background :)"
5,FANTASTIC FLICK!!!,"It's a tremendous documentary, reminded me a lot of ""Breaking Away"" in that it's about bicycling. I would really recommend checking it out. It's very worthwhile, and a really unique examination of a great nonprofit--THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BIKE CHALLENGE.Love,Scott"
5,"For Daughter, Grandaughter and Great Neice",Out of all the lullabies this one has been a favorite from my daughter now 22 yrs. old to my grandaughter who is 3 and has fallen in the love with the lullabies and also to my Great niece! Don't ever stop producing this cd!!!!!!
5,"Wonderful, calming music for baby and toddler","I received this CD as a baby shower gift for our first daughter. She had a hard time settling down to go to sleep. So, I started playing this CD to her, when she was just a week old. The songs are so sweet. She would just relax and listen. I still sing some of the songs to her and she is now 5 years old. We liked this CD so much that we just recently purchased it for our nephew."
1,The product was damaged. But you did gfive me credit. Thank you.,I still wish to find and purchase a workable version . So anything you can do to help will be appreciated. Let me know.
3,A comedic look at the game of golf.,"In this video, Leslie Neilson pokes fun at all the rules and etticate of the game of golf."
4,Happy buyer,Book is in perfect condition. Very happy with seller. Would certainly use again.As far as the book goes: The chapters are short and to-the-point. The examples are adequate. It is a quick read and will be a great reference for a tricky subject like threading.
2,Form and Function?,"Have had this stethoscope for 3 years now. I love that is supports a great cause and I have no complaints about its functionality. However, it does stain easily as at least one other reviewer pointed out. I have tried everything to keep it clean (pen marks, general wear and tear), but nothing has worked for me. I take pride in neatness, cleanliness and professionalism. That being said, approaching patients with a stethoscope that looks like it's been living in a junk drawer became a bit of an embarrassment. Sadly, this one stays at home now."
4,my son is in PA school and needs a good stethescope,"good, basic stethescope which should be ideal for the work he is undertaking; and no more needs to be said"
5,3M LITTMAN CLSSIC,ITS VERY NICE STETHOSCOPE AND GOOD SELLER RELLY NICE NICE I USE IT IN THE PARAMEDIC FIELD SO EASY TO USE AND HEARING ANY THING
5,Hearing is Believing,"Before I purchased the Littmann 2210 Classic II S.E. Raspberry Stethoscope it used to take me up to an hour to crack a tough safe. BUT NOW, I can crack any safe in no time. The tunable diaphragm makes it a snap to hear both the high and low frequencies which is a must to get the job done so I can get on with my busy day!My wife also loves this stethoscope for nursing school, which is also nice...I guess."
2,3M littmann classic 2 S.E. stethoscope,I was dissapointed to see that the stethescope had been opened and the box that it came in had the seals cut. I thought it was suppose to be NEW but instead saw finger prints on my stethescope and it was clearly used. Buyer beware!
3,Good as expected,Stetho is good as expected. Price compred to other sites including all [...] comes to b cheaper because it ships free from amazon. I recommend my friends to buy this.
2,cheap feel and lousy sound,you get what you pay for...and you cannot return it! terrible product 8 more words required...terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible
4,3M Littman,"I was sent a duplicate Stethoscope. Only 1 was ordered, but I received and was billed for 2.No return info was in the package. Help......Product is great. Communication from Amazon....not so good"
5,One of the best!,"Absolutely love this stethoscope! Used it throughout nursing school and now as a nurse on a oncology/tele floor :) The quality is great, can hear up to the faintest lung sounds. The ear pieces are super comfortable, not like those Prestige stethoscopes. The one thing I was disappointed with is the color is a really pale peachy-pink, so unfortunately it may get slight markings on it with wear. Would highly recommend it though!"
4,dollar for dollar,"In today's world, a sad but true comment about a stethoscope in a busy hospital Emergency Room is that laying one down is often like giving one away. Dollar for dollar, this Littman delivers quite the punch. Sturdy construction and adequate listening with the diaphragm serves the purpose. Buying the green one at least gives me a slight margin in the field of recovery should I lay it down. And if it walks away, its not hurtful to replace."
3,A bit overrated,"I think this one is a bit overrated. It is better than the toy junk that came with my student kit. I can actually hear through this one but it isn't as clear as some of the other models I have tried. I probably would have went up a step in quality if this hadn't been so highly recommended. I guess this is a good beginners model, but since I am investing in it anyhow I would have preferred to pay a bit more and get something I wouldn't replace later. Also, the color was not true to the picture. Another student at my school ordered the same color and it was true but mine was more light pink than cranberry."
1,It is broken already,The diaphragm fell off this stethoscope within a few weeks after purchase. It is now good for nothing. Remind me never to buy Littman again
4,Littmann classic II,I have had this stethoscope for about a month now and have used it almost daily. It does what I need it to and is far superior to the others I have used. Very light so I do not feel like I am wearing a weight around my neck. I chose the brass finish which was very nice (looks like gold) against the black tubing. Everything I needed.
5,Nice,"I get a lot of complements on my stethoscope, and functions perfect! Cannot beat the price compared to other websites."
4,I Like It,"excellent product, thanks for all. everything is ok, color, reference, quantity, off course was a pleasure buy in your store. thanks again."
5,"Excellent, concise review","This is an excellent review for the certification exam. The exam itself is pretty tricky, because it tests topics that you probably never use in your day-to-day programming. The ""Exam Cram"" highlights those potential trouble spots, without wasting hundreds of pages on the language basics.I've been programming and teaching Java for about 4 years. I think I would have passed the exam without studying, but it would have been close. Thanks to this book, I did well on the exam."
4,Serves its purpose!,"Use this book to supplement any additional learning resources for SCJP Exam. Chapters are short and to the point. Great for quick review and reminder. Did find a few paragraph's which where not clear and up-to-par but in general, this book serves it purpose of quick review. Don't think many people will learn Java or pass the exam with just this book alone. A decent purchase."
3,Don't just use this one,"I took the exam recently, but found that Mr. Brogan's book is a little short on some of the topics of the exam. I however highly recommend using for its concise coverage of the material, but look for another good book especially on the topics of threading, awt, and inheritence. These were tested heavily on the test I had (surprised to see at least 10 questions on AWT and listeners on the test!).These areas of the test, I found the questions to be ambiguous and tough to decipher. I would recommend reading the O'Reilley book on Java Threads and a good AWT book. Since AWT isn't my speciality (I do server side programming), I am not sure which book would be the best.I also used the Simons book too, but that book is filled with fluff on the API and can be quite intimidating to get through. If you're looking for a quick study tool, here's a start, but by no means let it be your only source. Besides the test should not be taken lightly...study, study, study!!Good Luck!"
5,Excellent review,"By working through Core Java Volume 1 and then reviewing for the test with this book, I managed to pass with a nice score. Without the Exam Cram, I sincerely doubt that I would have passed at all. It even helped to clarify many concepts that were spotty after working through the much longer Core Java book. The only caveat is threads - while the author (very) briefly reviews the main concepts, you'll likely need another book to understand what the heck he's talking about. Great job, Bill!"
1,Factual error on the VERY FIRST PAGE!....,"You would think that a study guide would be pretty accurate, but ... WOW! I found several factual errors on the very first page of the book. The following error is on the ""Cram Sheet"" which is the very first page of the book (right behind the cover). The Cram Sheet says ""Logical OR operators | and ||."" Well, | is not a logical operator; it is a bitwise arithmetic operator. It goes on to say in the next two sentences ""The | operator always evaluates both operands. The || operator 'short-circuits' an evaluation and does not evaluate the right hand term ..."". WOW!!!!!!!!!! Nuf said!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Necessary but annoying sometimes,"Like the other reviewers, I agree you need this for the most efficient path toward passing the exam. BUT it has several ( 3 so far in 1st half of book) imprecise explanations which can lead to incorrect answers on the exam.I was not so critical until I received a rather terse reply from the author. He wrote ""you know what I mean"".I suggest if that is what the author truly feels and he wasn't just having a bad day, then you should not rely on this as your only guide. Get something that is more definitive ( e.g. Java 2 certification study guide )to double check the definitions and explanations in this book."
4,good concise review of exam objectives,I passed the SCJP2 Exam using this book in conjunction with Roberts & Heller and Barry Boone's book. The exam cram title is very appropriate in that the book does not really try to teach you concepts. You should have a fairly good grounding in Java fundamentals and use this book as a refresher before taking the exam. The practice exam in the book should be a pretty good predictor of whether you can pass the actual exam.
1,Horrible,I had just got one and the quality was horrible I just started playing it and it does not sound right I have been playing the sax for over 10 years. I would not recommend this instrument to any student or professional.
2,Drew,"I'd better keep reading KH's paranormal books, they are overly better than this one. The problem with this book was that Drew knew everything and everybody in the world. How could he? The love story is fairly good, but the thrilling part is heavy and sometimes boring. So I can say the love story drew and won the thrilling part."
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"I had moderate expectations for this book, but was really blown away with how good it ended up being.It's exactly the right length and goes into just the right amount of detail.I look forward to sharing this book with family and friends.This is written by pretty much and unknown guy with an unknown publisher; yet it is head and shoulders better than more commercialized material."
1,I would not recommend this video for young children.,"Having some exposure to Ms. Duvall in her Fairy Tale Theater series, I expected much more from her Mother Goose Rock 'n Rhyme. The characters were rude and quarrelsome, and the scenes were loaded with double meaning. I didn't want my 2 1/2 year old daughter nor my 15 month old son picking up on any of the behaviors within this video. My wife and I turned it off within 10 minutes of its playtime."
2,Disappointing...,"I believe this DVD was designed for those who are uninterested in reading the manual included with their Lowrance sonar/gps and unwilling to practice adjusting the settings on their own to experience how the unit functions. I expected to learn how to become a more proficient user, but found the instruction so basic, it was not helpful. The quality is satisfactory, but the depth of information provided is what most would call entry level. I would not recommend this unit for those who have already used Lowrance sonar/gps products."
5,Pure Genius,"Omar Sharriff is very likely the greatest living Blues Musician/vocalist/keyboardist/composer on the planet. He also covers everyone from Gerschwin to Hendrix with brilliant originality. Having heard him play live many times, I can also testify that he is a hell of a nice guy, who should be playing Carnegie Hall instead of dive bars. His current status in the music universe is sad testimony to the state of our society. Omar eschews rap music, and he has more integrity in one fingernail than most rappers will ever have, even if they live to his age, which is unlikely looking at their lifestyles. Omar is 70 years ago, born in Louisiana, and later a transplant to the West Coast. He now resides in Sacramento, California.Jeffrey M. Reiser M.D."
5,Fantastic,Came across this album recently and it's fantastic. I would agree with the reviewer who states that Great Balls of Fire is out of place but it's magnificently played. Wish there was more of Omar's work available.
5,Solid set of lectures,"The book is a scientific diary which presents some theoretical results of the physics of black holes (often peculiar, like the black hole horizon having electrical resistance of 377Ohm/square) and introduces the holographic principle. Conceptually the level of the presentation is high but mathematics is kept at minimum which makes the book an excellent reading for anyone with a solid background in quantum mechanics and relativity. The book is very clearly written."
5,you take too long for delivery!!!!!!!,"The cd that I recieved was very good. Although I have not yet recieved the second cd that I ordered, TWO MONTHS AGO!!!Is there anything wrong with this picture??? service?"
5,Favourite anime of all time,"I actually bought this series on VHS several years back. I've seen it like 70 times (seriously), and it is still my favourite. This anime is action-packed to say the least and, together with an incredibly story this makes a killermovie. I had to get this DVD pack as my VHS is getting worn. The VHS series consists of five parts, while this DVD pack contains 7. It is the same story though, the episodes are only split up differently"
1,Why is Rachel weeping?,Rachel is weeping because people are selling Red Strings that have not been wrapped around Rachel's Tomb. Rachel's Tomb-- you know?--in Israel. Provide more information if it does indeed come from Israel.
2,Fooled!,"I was torn between this phone and the Vtech, and because of the ATT name I chose this one. Fooled! Ths background hiss in the handset is very annoying. So much so that the phone is going back tomorrow. Maybe the Vtech will be better..."
1,Returned it the same day,"I purchased this phone to replace a Panasonic kx-tg2570 that had it's useful range drop to 10ft. I unpacked the 2440, hooked it up, charged it for a little while and tried to make a call. The ""hissing"" noise from the earpiece was so LOUD I immediately repacked it and returned to the store. I had a 6 year old, 900MHz, ATT phone that sounded 100 times better. What happened?Don't buy this phone - unless you prefer one way conversations."
1,"Coleman 28-Quart Cooler With Bail Handle, Blue",The lids keep falling off due to faulty hinges. This model used to have much sturdier construction.I would not purchase this type again.
3,Not what we expected.,"Our men's group selects books to discuss, generally of a thoughtful, Christian nature, but sometimes we range farther afield, as we did with this title. I looked at the contents and some sample pages before ordering, but our reviewer, who was more thorough, said that the treatment of out-of-body experiences was not what he was expecting so we declined to buy multiple copies for the whole group. This is not a negative comment on the book, but an acknowledgement that it is not suitable for our purposes. We advise others to carefully examine the OOB examples if they are looking for something specific that may not be there."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK,"I am a big hockey fan and have read many of the best books out there. I picked this one up because the Espositos are a famous hockey family, the way Phil played was a precursor to how the game was to be played in the coming decades, and what Phil has done for the game since he stopped playing. Phil's life is a great story, but he should have gotten a better ghost writer for this one. It is not written well, it rambles and lacks any real string that guides you through the story nor leaves you with any real life lessons. It is effectively a chronological listing of select events in his life, and is written using prose, etc. seemingly targeted for high school kids.Phil was and is one of the biggest players to have influenced the game and I was expecting a book that was of the same caliber as his play and his approach to life during the game and after the game. This book did not deliver on those expectations.(Sorry Phil.)"
1,Espo fans on the shot,"Don't waste your time or money on this.Sloppy, poorly written, filled with cliches."
4,In My Opinion the Best Black Stallion Book,"Firstly, before reading this I recommend you first get familiar with ""The Black Stallion"" by reading a few of his books. Also reading ""The Island Stallion"" would greatly help. This book is about the closely matched competition between The Black Stallion (The Black) and The Island Stallion (Flame). It starts out as a letter to Alec Ramsey asking for help from Steve Duncun, but it turns out to be so much more. As the competition builds between the horses it also starts to build between the owners as well. This book will bring an exciting combination of shock and suspence."
5,It's delicious!!!,"... You feel high listening to those musics, when I walk you don't feel like stopping, you just want to keep going."
5,No Sense of Direction,An immensely enjoyable book with pearls of wisdom at the beginning of each chapter. It is written with humor and honesty that show understanding of the frustrations of world travel as a backpacker when visiting many countries. The contact with fellow travelers was sometimes hilarious. His description of the indiginous people of many countries was so vivid I could almost see them. The book was like walking into and participating in a travelog.
4,"If you like to travel, this is your book.","No Sense of Direction was exactly what I needed to get away without actually getting away.This is a fun, and interesting, book that tells what it's like to travel on a budget without any set plan. I took a similar trip years ago, and while I was reading this book, felt like I was traveling again. The author meets very interesting people along the way, uses short chapters to keep the story moving, and has a style of writing that's very engaging. If your idea of traveling is staying in four-style hotels, then this isn't the book for you. But if you have a limited budget, and have ever had the urge to just take off and see where your travels take you, then I certainly recommend this book. Even if you don't go off and travel, you'll feel like you had!"
3,Forgotten,The only thing I can say about this was that I think I enjoyed it at the time but I can't remember anything about it.
3,Caught by the re-publish!,"I love Charlaine Harris, and have read all her books. When this was published I should have taken a closer look as I didn't realize that I had read it a few years ago. I just wish that Amazon would put in the description that it was a re-release."
4,Solid Mystery,"This earlier book by Charlaine Harris is a classic whodunnit with a nasty rape being the central impetus for the rest of the story. Harris does a solid job of putting together the world of a college town, but not a strong job making the characters stand out individually. The narrative is compelling and the story moves along rapidly. A solid mystery."
5,1984 BOOK - STILL RELEVANT TODAY,"A 1984 novel; however, the subject (rape) and its treatment is the same as today. Nickie Callahan, a New York model, returns to Knolls, Tennessee to continue her college education. She moves in with an old, dear friend (MiMi) from her younger years. At Houghton College, there has been a rape of a young first year student in broad daylight. This novel really moves - took about 10 hours to read. It was worth every moment."
2,I couldn't read this...,"First let me say I am a Charlaine Harris fan. I've read and enjoyed all the Aurora, Sookie, Harper & Lily novels she's written. They usually took me a day or so each to read. I've spent three days trying to read 'A Secret Rage' and I got 64 pages into it and quit. I just could not find anything to care about in the 'heros' of this story. One a hyper-rich southern belle who's only problems appear to be a bad taste in men and trying to bend the entire town to her will and the other a rich, beautiful model whom at the terrible age of 27 was told by her agent she was washed up and to quit before she was milked dry... Boo-hoo? Like her other early novel (both reprinted, in my opinion, only because Harris had become famous) ""Sweet and Deadly"" I couldn't find any reason to care about the main characters and therefore couldn't find any hook to draw me into the book."
4,Penelope delivers again!,"I was introduced to Penelope through the Blue Bottle Club and subsequently have read all her other books. They are all good in their own right. Amber Photograph falls short somewhat, but I cannot put ANY of her books down. This fact totally amazes me since she is listed as ""Christian Fiction"". I love all her characters and take something from each book I read. I will re-read all of them in the future and share them with anyone who will take them and return them to me."
4,"Great looking, but....","This vehicle is highly detailed and in some ways historically accurate, but all the little doo-dads that come with it dont stay put on the vehicle very well. The driver that comes with the vehicle is almost impossible to get in the drivers seat and make it look like hes driving.All in all a fine model, but not a good toy for kids or 30 year old kids like me to play with."
5,best of it's kind,I recintly pucased this product. i was looking at it in the store and thought it would be a nice adition to my collection. when i opended the package i was very amazed at it's detial and detialed accesories. the rifles look worn and they even make the vecle it self look like it is in combate i have been using these XTREME detail product to pay a game me and my friend s have been making and the products like the building and every thing elese make the 10 foot by 5ft board come to lfe all the soldgers and there wepones look so life like and a detial i wouldn't be suprised if they did not breath. these product are not made for little children nore amed at teens and adults thier are many small parts . they are like pre built modles that are detail right down to the pupil of thier eye. i feel that i got more then what i payed for they give u your moneys worth and a bag of chips.
3,Our Dog Prefers Soft Treats,"Our dog will not eat the Wellness Wellbar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats; however, we crush two of these up for each daily feeding and mix them with his regular dog food. For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year. He loves these.Wellness WellBar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats, 50-Ounce Pouch"
4,Happy dogs,"My two dogs really seem to enjoy these. I have one who will not eat regular dog biscuits and our vet suggested these. She will still hesitate, but she eats these pretty quickly especially if we break them in half for her."
4,A novel of choice,"CROSSPOINTS by Alexandra York blends the greatness of Ancient Greece with the mixed premises of modern New York. It portrays heroes, villains and middle-of-the-roaders-all in convincing fashion.The plot, theme, characterization and style are all first-rate. You feel like you are right there, in the story, going through what the characters are going through. It is thrilling enough to want to read quickly and deep enough to make you slow down and ponder the fundamental ideas presented.The heroine Tara has the kind of idealism and beauty not seen in today's literature--and is certainly the kind of woman I'd love to meet. Bravo!Inspiring in its Romantic Realism, this is truly a novel of ideas that dramatizes how choice preceeds human action."
5,Excellent reference for linguists of all levels,"Ever wondered how a particular language functions? Well, this book is the one to use! It includes grammatical sketches of languages with sizeable amounts of native speakers. Each section generally contains the some of the following about a language: brief historical background, phonology, morphology, syntax, and if it's not written in Roman letters, a chart for that particular alphabet/syllabary. One of the things I particular liked was giving word-for-word translations then giving a free one. This gives me an idea on how languages like German, Japanese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, etc. form their sentences (like SVO, VSO, SOV). And also for some languages, like Polish and Spanish, it lists the allophones for a phoneme. A word of advice, I highly recommend having at least some knowledge in linguistic terminology and in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), since this book uses them extensively. This is one reference work that you should definitely have."
5,A must!!,"This text is clearly one of the best in its field. It is well organized and very thorough. The organization and attention to detail make it a great referrence source and an easy read. It should be in anyone's library that takes of critically ill patients. I would highly recommend it for fellows in critical care medicine. The ""Pretest"" question and answer study guide that is a companion to this text is also excellent and a great tool for the critical care boards. I am anxiously awaiting the next edition."
5,Start Here!,"If you are curious about Asatru and just looking for a primer than this is your book. A quick (and good) read. You will have a foundation from which if you choose, you can expand on with more detailed works down the road. However this little book is as good a primer on any subject that I have ever read."
1,"Because of this man, punk rock probably will be dead pretty soon.",This sucks. This sounds like a mediocre Misfits cover album. The lyrics are just plain f@*king stupid and the cover makes me laugh. Get Misfits - Walk Among Us instead of this piece of trash if you want good horror punk.
1,Not tough enough,My miniature Dachshund loved this toy while it lasted. My puppy is 4 months old and within a few days the squeaker was no longer working and within several more days the squeaker was pushed into the toy creating a hole in the toy. My dog still attempts to take the squeaker out by biting at the hole. The plastic is pretty tough but they needed to make the squeaker and surrounding area stronger to withstand an aggressive persistent chewer.
1,All coasters in my Pioneer BDR-205,"My Pioneer BDR-205 burner produces all coasters with this pack of discs, every time.Burning the same files with the same burner to Verbatim discs works perfectly.I've bought a lot of Ritek/Ridata CD and DVD media in the past and never had trouble, so this is disappointing. I won't be buying any more Ridata BD media."
2,This book sends the wrong message to children,"I'm afraid this teaches children the wrong lesson. Bear works hard all year to grow tomatoes. Bunny does nothing. In the end, Bear has tomatoes and Bunny doesn't. So far, so good, ... but then Bear hands a slew of tomatoes over to Bunny and everyone lives happily ever after.The lessons Bear learns are good ones. Hard work pays off and being generous is good. However, the lesson for Bunny was that he can sit back, do nothing, and his neighbors will take care of him.Yes, it's a childrens book. Yes, it's just a rehash of Aesop's old tale about the grasshopper and the ant. Still, at least Aesop had the grasshopper learn his lesson. What's missing from this book is the moral ... that last page that says ""and this is why you shouldn't be Bunny."""
5,A knockout bargain,"How can I review the greatest string quartet ever? The recording is quite decent, a remastering of LPs that were already excellent. Don't think scratchy reissue.And the performance? My god, these guys are total quartetness--I just listened to the Dissonant Quartet, and there is a rhythmic thrust beyond others, no matter when recorded. The proof is in the astounding gasps--there's no more accurate term--in the last movement. There may have been equally good performances that I'll never know because they were early 20th century, but thanks there are these great performances that got the benefit of good recording."
4,Beyond The Ashes,"As a fellow writer, I do not enjoy reading other authors material. On this ground breaking book I had to break that rule. this book has so much heart into it, I just can't put it down."
4,The Start of Chronic Pain Relief,This was recommended by my physical therapist due to my chronic pain. Been using three weeks and I feel it's helping.
4,Egoscue is ready when you are!,"I purchased this after spending 16 months doing specific egoscue ecises developed for me by them for debilitating back and neck pain I had for over 10 years. Patience with Egoscue is a virtue. Now that I am finally feeling great and can do so many sports I could not before, this video series allows me to maintain my good posture. You feel so grounded and srong when you complete this workout. It is really quite easy,but offers you the benefits of a really good workout."
3,Sad but fun,"I just finished the second and final season of this series. I was left with a saddness. Peppard was one of the actors that was ""cool"" but never really became great. I played who was in what tv series with guest cast and I was struck by how many of these people are now dead. Banacek is dated by the clothes and cars that are seen in the shows. The mysteries are a mixed lot. Some are hard to figure [the magican one was kind of neat], while some were too simple[the missing airplane[. However that isn't the point, the point is the ""cool"" factor. I remember wearing those turtle neck shirts, smoking those pencil thin cigars, and never getting the girl, oh well. I think that this series might do with a revisit and upadeting. Anyway bye bye to a ""cool"" time in tv."
5,stukapendable,the stuka is a great collectable at reasonable price it is a late model dive bomber since it has machine guns instead of 2 37mm cannons for its arsenal. but still great camo scheme and the figures come with beutiful realistic uniforms. one thing i didnt like was that the swatstika was replaced at the tail but that i can fix. buy when you see it!!!!
2,not useful for self-learner,"The accompanying CDs that contain only exercises, but not the lessons. Not helpful for learning at home for self learner"
5,Beautiful Paris,"Mr. Crawford provides triple pleasure with this wonderful tour of Paris. There is the exotic and often unusual views of this magnificent city, his great photographic eye that provides capture of both noble and pedestrian scenes and his painter's touch to digitally enhance these beautiful images."
3,"More than ""cool""","While ""Miss Misery"" may seem at first like the hipster's guide to New York, it is really more of a surreal coming-of-age novel that just happens to find its inspiration in the world of early twenty-first century pop culture and e-communication. David Gould is suffering from a twenty-something malaise, trying to make the shift from adolescent potential to adult reality. He must learn to choose his own life. His inability to do this leads to the breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend, a webblog-fueled depression, and, eventually, a total crisis of being that tears him in two . . . for serious. As he explores the landscape of New York and suburban America, he comes to find out what is actually important to him. Like any good coming-of-age novel, it's a story about learning how to live, and it's a strong debut from Mr. Greenwald."
2,bad characters,"This book started well, the middle was okay and the end was dissapointing. The main characters are not very believable. The doppelganger concept was somewhat interesting, but holes in the concept were distracting, and the end was a big let down.The main characters are relatively uninteresting and have no real depth. I thought the biggest problem was when the main character (David) went on a trip to Utah. His actions seemed totally unnatural and contrived.If there are any authors out there reading this I have one request: Please do not end a book with one of your characters saying something like ""Gosh, that was a fun adventure. Maybe I should write a book about it.""I'm trying to think of what I would recommend instead of this book. The only thing that comes to mind is ""Middlesex"" by Eugenides. I think it is a much better book."
5,Love It,"Bought the normal version of this about a year ago and installed, seemed to work alright but then i sold the car. Time came around again to installing new subs and I was going to go the same route but saw this for only $2 more. Decided worth the little extra amount and would highly recommend the competition series. The fuse is WAY better because my AGU kept shorting out. Will never go back when i have to make my next purchase."
2,Not worth it,"I picked this book up looking for a good overview of Barbarossa with a lot of pictures. Well, there are a lot of pictures. However, if you want a good overview of the Operation, look elsewhere. There are almost no maps, so the author's narrative of events becomes very abstract for those who haven't memorized Russian geography. The narrative itself is not bad, but is rather dry. As for the pictures, which should be the crowning jewel of this book, there are almost none from the Russian perspective. The author's personal collection was used, and appears to be entirely German. The few pictures he inserts of Russians who are not not captured, shot, or blown up, come from elsewhere. The book should more appropriately be called ""German Images of Barabarossa."" I recommend Osprey's Ostfront for a more well-rounded, better written and visually appealing introduction to Barbarossa."
3,Good book for assessments overview,"Network Security Assessment is a quite good book. It lists many scanning tools and techniques appliable on different network aspects, reordering ideas to a confused security beginner.I need to say it doesn't do an in-depth scanning analysis for any assessment aspect, and few chapters are more tools lists than else. I also disagree on subjects placement in chapters.But it has a wide range of discussed arguments and I appreciated it very much.Readers with no strong knowledge on scanning techniques should consider this book a good starting point for deeper studies on every argument quoted in it.Readers with enough knowledge on widely used scanning techniques have nothing new to learn here."
4,Not so much for a puppy ^^,"I like this leash because of the built-in traffic lead. However, I think it would be put to more use on my crazy blue heeler than on my sweet little mini aussie puppy. He walks on a leash no problem, but it freaks him out when the traffic lead handle swings out a little further than the lead over his head.On my heeler though, this leash would be useful with the extra handle. I wouldn't necessarily recommend for little dogs or puppies, but for pullers or city dogs, it'd be a good choice =D"
4,Dancing Gale Harold. How bad could it be?,"Bought this movie because I'm a Gale Harold fan. I found it a bit odd, but certainly worth watching more than once. The scenes of Gale dancing are fun."
4,Fine,"It was basically a fine DVD. Once in a while, it did pause, but then started again. So I would give it 4 stars."
1,Poor Quality,"Recording of ""Once an Eagle"" is out of sequence. It has seven parts and eight windows for each segment?We had to watch it twice to pick up parts out of order. I wonder if all copies of this DVD has the same glitch.Most disappointing and would love to return it and try a different one to see, if it too, has not been recordedproperly. This problem should be corrected and anyone who reads this and has had the same problem I hopethat you report it. I also hope that Amazon is aware of the problem with a product they sell. If you can sit throughthis irritating ""jump around"" it is a dynamic movie."
3,once an eagle,"while i enjoyed seeing it again, 1st in '76, this remake is incomplete by app. 2 hours. i'm not happy. the story now has no end."
2,"Great Story, Faulty Disk","We love this story, and San Elliot does a fine job of acting, however it was very difficult to select and play each episode. We were completely unable to play the final episode (8). I would rather have had the episodes put together, like a regular movie, especially with the difficulty we had. We will be returning this product for a refund."
1,Once an Eagle,"Moderately good storyline, but very broken on this replay of a movie made for television. Do not buy this edition, as the story is chopped extensively by the various breaks for tv commercials and next weeks edition, etc. etc. I was very disappointed in it."
1,Don't waste your money,"It got to me just fine, but it skips through several pieces. Each time you shut it off, you have to go back to beginning of disc. Doesn't have a good menu at all. Poorly done all the way around."
4,maybe,i have read that a new company is taking over the rights for the film. hopefully the missing footage will be restored.
5,Best Sellers,"I remember this one from the mid '70's when I was in high school. It keeps the thrills going through out. Not only is it a good war yarn that led the way for Winds of War as well as War and Remembrance or the North And South trilogy, but it gives a good look at the social climate of the times. Once an Eagle and its stable mate The Rhineman Exchange makes for a great weekend. Helps you remember The NBC Best Seller series that led the way to some of the greatest of all Mini-Series. Gone are the days of Sam Elliot at his best as Sam Damon, who his wife tagged as a Knight Errant."
4,An Exhausted Fixer,"if you go into this record expecting the same record as ""per second...every second,"" you'd be wrong. you have to go back to wheat's first two indie records, and then listen to the ""per second"" demos to understand what the band originally started out as.this is a sonic experiment, similar to wilco's ""yankee hotel foxtrot."" it has its accessible songs, and it has its beautiful dissonance. ""a prayer for kathy"" is a slow builder, and it works towards something big.i think it is a moving statment. so just listen."
5,Wonderful product & Great Shipping,"The product was delivered as promised, inexpensively and in time for the holidays. The person who received the gift loves it! It was one of the few bar sets I found that was classy and fit with the style of her living room. Highly recommend this product and this seller!"
5,This was superb,"This book is great for everyone from a medical student venturing into research to an accomplished researcher looking for ways to improve his or her presentations. The author emphasizes concise writing, visually logical and simple graphical presentation, and focuses on the issues that trip up even the experienced researcher. I use it frequently."
5,Taste Like I'm In The Islands!,"The cakes arrived very soon after we placed our order. They are fresh, flavorful, and there is absolutely no difference in these and the ones I purchased in the islands."
5,"A complex, but readable, biography of a remarkable character","A very thorough, engaging biography about the fascinating creator of Sherlock Holmes. While the going becomes overly dense on occasion, most of the chapters move along purposefully enough to create a coherent whole. Filled with many interesting and entertaining anecdotes and information, and not a little unwelcome speculation. Recommended for Conan Doyle or Holmes fans, as well as those interested in the late Victorian/early 20th century period."
1,Cheap quality trays! do not recommend,Do not get them. You can grow wheatgrass in Lasagne trays instead. They will cost you much less and will work just the same.
3,Nothing like the real test...,"this book simply does not model the actual test even one bit. Like everyone else says, the questions are too redundant and the same idea could be reduced to a couple of lines. This book has detailed questions about scripting (which isn't on the test) and it had other questions like how to log on to an IBM mainframe and some other stuff like that (also not on the test). It did, although, do a good job of explaining, and if you could answer about 60% of the questions, you will pass. The questions on the I-net+ are mostly 1-liners, so this book did not help that much in preparation. But if you wanna test yourself with the deepest and most complex questions imaginable for this topic (up to 1 1/2 pages i think, addressing complex scenarios), then get this book."
5,I installed on my 97 Subaru Legacy GT,"Be careful when opening the box, it's a little flimsy. Came with a hose and mounting equipment. Looks and feels like a quality product but I haven't been able to use it much since I blew a head gasket."
3,"Ok, for beginners","This book is OK for beginners. It has good welding, chopping and technical tips but no significant and attractive designs. The designs are outdated and honestly not something I want to be seen with in public. The online designs are much more attractive and up to date. So if you are a experienced welder and chopper just get the online designs. If you are just starting out this book will help you on the way. Hence the 3 stars. If, even some of, the designs where included the 5 stars would be appropriate."
5,Charming Ring,"When I received my turtle ring, I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was even better than described and I have had tons of compliments on this ring. The shipping and packaging was bar none better than most jewelry companies I have purchased from. You won't be sorry if you decide to order this ring from Gem Avenue."
5,I love this workout!,I am not much of a reviewer but this workout is easy to follow and it gets my heartrate up and I sweat (which I love)!
1,Wish it were better; I love Cindy,"I ordered two of Cindy Whidmarsh's DVDs produced by Natural Journeys after loving her 10 Minute Solution / Target Toning DVD (produced by another company). The quality (video and sound) of Natural Journeys products leaves a lot to be desired. They were so bad that I returned them to Caiman, explaining that the beginning of one of them was lopped off, and the other was so bad that I could hardly hear it. On the other hand, I use the 10 Minute Solution DVD nightly. It's absolutely wonderful. This is the first time I've overcome my sciatica in 30 years. I would recommend the 10 Minute Solution / Target Toning DVD -- and all of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs -- since the quality is far superior to anything I've seen so far (except The Firm; they're great too). But don't bother buying any of the Natural Journeys DVDs or you'll be disappointed."
1,Too fast,"Everything is too fast in this video, especially the weightlifting segments. This type of speed just invites injuries. Workout is filmed outside in someone's backyard--don't really understand how you can translate a lot of these moves to an indoor setting--kind of impossible to jump rope on carpet and throw weighted medicine ball up into air when your ceilings are only 8 ft. high."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased these several years ago. I love the Channellock line of tools but this is by far the worst I have ever bought. I am not a professional electrician but I do some electrical work as put of my job and these have never got the job done efficiently. I have found it to be much easier NOT to use them, if fact I gave them to my kids to play with. 2 stars are only for the fact that they are made in the USA."
3,A Good Place To Start,"Making Wood Folk Instruments is a great reference book. If you're looking for detailed ""how to"" book, you may want to look elsewhere. But if you just need a spark of imagination or want to see what the end of the journey looks like - this is a reasonable expense.I found myself distracted by the decidedly outdated photographs, but was still intrigued by the ideas and simple instruments demonstrated within the book. I built a mountain dulcimer from the project pages, and with just a few modifications it is a very nice instrument.Get it. Use it. Keep it around. You'll use it again."
2,Bain de Soleil Mega Tan,I used this product devotedly for several years until it became almost impossible to obtain in stores or internet orders. It might even be unavailable? I switched to another newer self tan product with 15 SPF and found it to be highly superior. The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin.
4,Great but not a PS2 compatible,The only problem I have with this is I have to go to some other room besides mine to see this DVD.
4,Good product,"These work MUCH better than the plastic safety latches most stores carry. Very easy installation. The metal is flexible so you can adjust them a bit. This does also mean that occasionally they won't catch, but it does the job on keeping small hands out of cabinets."
4,"Easily captured me, as his journey apparently captured him.","After a trip to Zimbabwe and Botswana recently, I became entranced with Africa. Kevin Kertscher validated my new-found emotional attachment to the continent. His fascination with and acceptance of his experience is easily understood by the reader. And his strong visual sense and training is apparent in his verbal description of his experiences and environment. This is an easy read of a way of life so foreign. I don't know that I would have the wherewithall to travel as he had done, but this book makes me feel as if I had been along with him on his journey."
4,Hard Case Crime Does It Again!,"Domenic Stansberry's The Confession is an off-speed thriller from the stellar Hard Case Crime line of new and old noir classics. This one takes a little while to get going, but once it does, it keeps you guessing right up until the end. The only flaw, I found, was the use of an unsymapthetic narrator. This took guts and Stansberry gets full marks for going that way, but seeing as the book is first-person, we get closer than we'd like to the narrator. This is a minor point, but slightly marred my enjoyment of the book. The novel's merits far outweigh its faults. Great, literate writing, unrelenting suspense, and characters that ring true. All in all a great read. And I recommend it!!"
2,An OK story under the wrong banner,"Sure, Domenic Stansberry had his book THE CONFESSION published under the HARD CASE CRIME banner. That doesn't mean this feels anything like the crime pulp novel it claims to be.It's a psychological thriller (a fairly unoriginal one at that) and extremely dark. I felt sort of glad when I was through with it just because I knew that after I read it once I wouldn't have to really return to it again unless I was in the mood to read passage after passage of some guy rambling on about the psyche and how it can make you go crazy sometimes.Sort of self-indulgent and pretentious at times, but has it's moments."
3,Miss having woody do the voice over,but it's still a good woody allen film. It doesn't have the quality of cinematography of his older works but it's still good.
2,Very Poor Streaming Quality,"While the movie was okay, I may have found it more enjoyable had the video streaming been more reliable. I was on a hard line connection with high transfer rates, and the video and audio continually were not in-sync, which likely made my opinion of the movie less interesting.This is not the first time I've been disappointed with a streaming movie from Amazon, and the irony of this was that this particular movie was provided as a Customer service gift for ""loyalty"". Not sure how loyal I can stay to the streaming video aspect of Prime Services, but I'm hoping they can do something to fix this problem if it is an ongoing issue for other customers as well."
4,Stellar film...,"Wonderful performances including an Academy-Award winning one from Penelope Cruz, excellent score, beautiful locales--all more than enough reasons to enjoy the deliciously sexy ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". Only quibble is that there are no extras on this DVD. But the film is well worth adding to your collection."
4,Solid Woody Allen Fare,"The major part of Woody Allen's body of cinematic work considers sexual matters bordering the perverse. ""Vicki Christina Barcelona"" is more of the same, but done, as always in Allen films, deftly. The absurdity of the situations was amusing, and I found myself smiling frequently during the film. Penelope Cruz was outstanding among a number of good performances. As a guitarist I appreciated the partial renditions of ""Granada"" and ""Leyenda"" in the background."
3,"Good date movie, but every character talks like Woody Allen","I won't delve into the plot, acting, scenery, editing and everything else that constitutes a movie. Plenty other reviewers do that. This movie didn't have to be believable (the grad student who knows little Spanish and spends no time in the library) or particularly witty (wow, did a character actually use the phrase ""turgid argument about the categorical imperative""?)....I was just irritated that every character sounded like Woody Allen! Whiney, self-absorbed, quick to moralize about everything objectionable....could the man get out in the real world and listen to how other people talk? Heck, even reading a book by Richard Price might help him...."
2,Woody Allen's sex fantasies,"Seems like the centerpiece of this movie is a certain sex fantasy (I won't offer a spoiler) involving Scarlett Johansson. Stilted dialog, wooden acting- I found the whole thing implausible, and the characters completely unsympathetic. I give the movie two stars only for the stunning scenes of Barcelona."
2,"Somewhat engaging, but ultimately dissapointed","Definitely carried by the strength of the actors and some intelligence of the dialogue, but in the end the story melts away like an icicle. Once again Woody shows his lack of skill in writing overly dramatic material.More dissapointing, in the end it's fairly misagynistic on women as all three either self-destruct or wander aimlessly thru life. A brief hand full of comic moments douse the emotional banality of the story. I enjoyed the spanish locale as a twist of the allen discography, but that ultimately didn't save this lemon."
4,Review: Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"I bought this movie for two reasons: Scarlett Johansson, and Woody Allen. Both were pretty predictable. My wife thought the male lead (Javier Bardem) was sexy, but I thought he looked like the guy at Jiffy Lube. Anyway, I would have to call this a ""chick flick"" as there are motivations that escape me, but made perfect sense to my wife (The engaged girl having an affair with the male lead made no sense to me). Great photography and scenery. Good for what it is, but not particularly interesting to me."
2,Woody is going downhill fast,"This is not much more than a holiday movie about two rather silly girls getting involved with a macho guy and his crazy hysterical wife. None of the characters was convincing or interesting. I think Woody was just looking for an excuse to spend some time in Barcelona with some pretty girls. It's a really bad film. I hated it, despite the nice scenery and cute girls."
1,What's not to love????,"Let's see...adultery, casual sex, threesomes , women in passionate kiss...and rated PG-13. And we are miffed at what our society has become? In addition, bad acting - tedious dialogue. Scenery beautiful."
2,Easy Yoga,This video does not make you sweat at all. It is for beginners. I was looking for a yoga video with more movement so I would sweat and I found this to be very simple. I was disappointed the words Power and Sweat were in the title and feel it is a misrepresentation of what the video is. This is more something I may do before bed.
5,good supplement for captive tortoises,"I'm always concerned that my 6 spur-thighs are getting all the vitamins and such that they need. In the wild they can just keep walking until they find everything required. In my garden that is limited by what is available. I dust their food with a different supplement each day. I'm currently using 5 different ""dusts"" and one spray liquid. 3 boys and 3 girls range from 4 to 6 years and are in very good health with nice smooth shells. The girls lay 3 to 7 eggs per year each and all the hatchlings have survived. I guess this stuff is supplying what they need."
2,"Works great, breaks soon.","I purchased four of these in 2002. All were carefully installed (the door must latch much be adjusted if required such that the deadbolt moves easily in and out of its strike) and are in light residential use - probably a max of 500 cycles on the most frequently used lock.As of October 2004 two have failed; one mechanically (motor turns but deadbolt does not move) one electronically (no response to keypad or programming button).These *are* convenient - but at a minimum I'd install two of these if there is any likelihood that you intend to use them in a keyless mode - that way you will still be able to use the other if one fails.----------Update: as of 04/09 all four have failed ... two electronically, two mechanically."
3,Not So Great!,"In my opinion, not his best. I much prefer 33, Todos Los Romances as far as singing, mood music and Luis Miguel at his finest!"
3,Good for eBay shipping,I bought this to help me ship things I sell on eBay. Works well and is easy to use. Good value for the $
3,You talk about a supportive partner!,"This goes to show that when you love someone you will do what ever it takes to care for that person. Like the vow says, in sickness and in health. Her partner was there in sickness and in health. He never left her side. That shows real love. So nice to see in this day and age."
4,"Useful supplement to the book, but don't use it as a standalone product","I noticed there were a lot of complaints about the production quality on this DVD.But I think it adequately performs the job it was created for: real time demonstrations of the level ""1"" meridian stretching routines described in Cooley's book. In fact, I think the actual selection of exercises for the ""Level 1"" routine is a bit better than those in the book (a couple of the tougher ones have been replaced with level ""2"" exercises that actually seem easier - to me - to perform.)Yes, this is a very bare bones DVD, but it certainly is inexpensive and has enough worthwhile material to be worth getting - IF you like the ocncept of ""resistance/meridian"" stretching and if you liked the book version of ""The Genius Of Flexibility"" and want to see the exercise s performed with live models. But again, I wouldn't recommend the DVD by itself - it is unlikely to convince anyone who isn't already enthusiastic about the concepts in the book."
1,The Worst Production Ever Done,"I bought this DVD after I read the book of the same title, expecting clarity and helpful hints in order to be able to use the author's principles to advantage. Instead, I got a DVD so poorly made that it negated every principle put forth in the book. The audio was abominable and terribly noisy. The actual directions were unnecessarily repetitive, and sometimes unintelligible. Mr. Cooley jumping in and out his minimal set was only distracting and not informative. If I could have given this product a 0 I would have. Mr. Cooley's genius was nowhere in sight."
1,This book is not worth reading at ALL!,"Yeah, this book is an absolute rip-off. It is just some 15 year old kid who saw resident evil (the movie) and 28 days later and decided he wanted to act like a big author and write a book combining these two movies. It is vulgar and crude and not even something a 15 year old kid should be publishing. PLus, he looks like a complete weirdo, have you SEEN the picture on the back. This book has no substance, and it is just so pointless it is unbearable. You get to the end feeling like you did actually just read something written by a 15 year old high school student, nothing more. It is really no good at all."
4,Good for Intermediate to Advanced Speakers,"This book does a good job laying out the grammatical rules, and explains them fairly clearly, but it is definitely geared toward those who already know some Japanese. A great deal of the book is in kanji, including some of the words they're explaining to you. Some of the examples have kanji and romanji to help you, but the author expects you to already have a solid grasp of the writing system. He leaves many words and examples untranslated, which makes it harder to grasp the concept for those who don't know any kanji, like myself. Even so, it's fairly understandable, and those who don't know kanji can still learn from it, albeit with a little more difficulty. I think it is a good resource, but I would recommend it for people who have already learned some Japanese."
3,Trust Lightnin' on Arhoolie,"As Lightnin' Hopkins' output for Arhoolie Records goes, this album is a lesser entry, but the fabulous Texas bluesman always seemed to be in good form for Chris Strachwitz's label, so all of it is worth having. These cuts are from a couple different sessions in the late '60s; the vast majority of tracks have Francis Clay on drums and one even has a full band. Again, fine, fine stuff, but there are a few too many remakes here. ""Mojo Hand"", ""Rock Me Baby"", ""Hello Central"", ""Little and Low"", ""My Starter Won't Start This Morning"", ""Baby Please Don't Go"", ""Trouble in Mind"": Lightnin's put all of these on record before, some of them many times. And he's not as inspired as on, say, the Arhoolie album ""Texas Blues"". Still, get this; it's still quite good and you could do a lot worse."
4,Tougher Then The UltraLights.,"I purchased my Black Diamond Vista Tent from HumbleOutdoors for about $330, it came with a free BD Footprint and free shipping.I needed a large backpackable tent for my sea kayak. A tent that could accommodate two people with room to spare, ability to fit into my smallish hatches, and able to handle the strong steady coastal winds. The Black Diamond Vista Tent fit the bill. It is solid and has two large doors. This tent is the perfect compromise between size, price, strength, and weight."
2,Mislead advertisement,I was thinking this was a over the hump floor mat that included the actual driver and passenger mats too. From the picture and description that is what I thought. Really disappointed with the product I got for the price. Would not recommend this to anyone. Find better deals elsewhere.
5,Excellent Service,"The delivery was prompt, I was very satisfied with the product, it was exactly how it was advertise. I have no problem doing business with merchant in future"
4,great net for $30,Surprisingly good net! It is a competition net for all-weather: sturdy and durable with metal cable that allows tighten the net without sagging.
2,This song doesn't do the album justice,"I caught a part of Donald's song Mishal and came to find out he and Cretu from Enigma hooked up - Strong combo - However, forget this weak single, check out the tenseness in Simple Obsession and Snowing Under My Skin!!! His voice reminds me of the song River's Of Belief which Cretu sang."
5,the heaven's voice,"hello, everybody, there no words to explain, when a heard for first time this new version of ""all out of love"" with andru donalds. now this is a classic.a ask to emi to release this in brasil, quick, quick.the emi's staff have to think more seriusly about this because we all need to know more about andru.HIS IS THE BIGEST NEW SENSATION ON MALE VOCALHE WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGER OF THE NEW CENTURYKISSES FROM BRAZILBIRA RONCHI"
3,book purchased,The book that I recieved was exactly as was described. I was pleased with this and would recommend this company to anyone wanting used books. Very good condition for being used.
3,A different kind of musk,"Musk is one of my favorites, but this musk is more for a more mature woman. I wound up giving it to my mother and she loves it. Great INexpensive Christmas or birthday gift."
5,Excellent!!!,One of the best European comic book!!!The writing is awesome and the art is simply amazing!!!A must have for all European comic books fan!
5,THE book for beginners learning how to cook.,This is a wonderful book for people who know nothing about cooking. The book is well organized and easy to understand.
5,Now You're Cooking: Everything a Beginner Needs to Know to,"This book is not just for beginners. I have been cooking all my life, but found so much helpful information in it that I have ordered it for all my daughters and kept a copy for myself."
4,Interesting Thoughts,"Mr. Handy has expanded on some of his thoughts from his earlier books plus some updates. It is a good documentation of his life experience and in the process gave a roadmap for those who wants to have a portfolio life, entrepreneur or have to work as an independent as organisations downsize or go bust.As always, his thoughts are profound. Some trends are some way yet and some among us may wish it does not happen. Only time will tell. What is instructive is that it gave us a peek and perhaps prepare and arm us for the eventuality.A nice read over the weekend if you seek inspiration to become your own employer."
3,The Royal Jewels,"Very beautiful review of the gems and the people who have worn them. I would have liked to have seen more of the jewels that exist from historical royals such as Elizabeth I or Henry VIIII, ect. A history of the gems origin would have enhanced the presentation."
2,"Comfortable, but not for long.....","I purchased these boots a little under a year ago, (about 10 months) and wore them about twice a week, until about two months ago, when I began using them as my every day boots. In that two month span, my heel pad fell off, and the stitching between the sole and the leather separated. I brought them back to western warehouse (now boot barn) today, who called justin, and justin told them ""tough s#!t, where not taking them back."" So although they were comfortable, I am not happy with paying $150 for boots to last me a less than a year, and less than two months of hard work. I hope you get your stuff straight, justin."
5,Fabulous!,Creative Albums is full of wonderful ideas with easy to follow instructions. Donna's fun narration combined with the fresh colors and textures in the project photos will delight you.
5,Inspiration and fun!,"How fun is this book?? Donna D. will open your eyes to what a scrapbook is, and exactly how to create one from the ordinary and everyday items you find around your home. Forget about heading to the scrapbook store -- dig through your office supplies or the junk drawer instead! Inspiring."
2,Meh?,"Definitely the worst of the Voyage series. What is depicted on the cover and in the book description has very little to do with the actual story, so I was extremely disapointed. You tend to hate Brad, and when he comes to his big ""realization"" you don't care. Raven Queen and Islands in the Sky had the same tone and feel of the original book, but this one is ""blah"" and boring. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Animal testing,"The product its great, but I search for companies that dont test on animals, and theres a lot of good companies now a days that care for animals, like mac and l'occitane, clinique, etc"
3,Gonna miss Andy Whitfield,"This is one of those movies that is just full of amazing ideas but it never feels more than a B movie. Granted, this film was released direct to video, but it was such a great idea that I feel it should have truly deserved a big production budget. For what it was, it was pretty good. For what it could have been, it was okay. I love Andy Whitfield and my heart goes out to his and family and friends who will truly miss him in a way the fans never will. Rest in Peace Brother."
3,JUST RIGHT BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!,"GABRIEL is a movie with a very interesting story but the lack of budget drove its makers to ceativity. it was good but could have been better. it could have been a very visual experince, considering the story.andy whitfield gave good acting, years before his ""spartacus"" role.for a kvie, it could have been trimmed to one and a half hours and the pacing could have been faster.all in all, it's not bad, but it is also not great. it has all the potentials, though.."
3,Meh,"Well, the angels all became very human. The movie throws you an unexpected twist towards the end, and then falls flat at the very end with a stupid supposedly dramatic ending twist.If you love Andy Whitfield, it's a nice watch; however, he's wearing clothes for most of the movie. If you don't care, then save your two hours of life for something else."
2,Terrible Movie,I thought this movie would have been better. I finally just turned it off because it was so bad. Very disappointed.
4,MOVIES,I have to be honest I haven't gotten around to watching this movie yet I've been so damn busy but once I do I'll redo this review!
3,Confusing end,"5 stars for the sexy female ""Jade"" character, less 2 stars for the confusing end.Towards the end of the movie, we see Archangel Michael healing Gabriel and Gabriel throwing himself down from the rooftop. Wait, didn't we learn earlier in the movie that once any angel, good or bad, dies in this earthly realm, s/he remains dead as a human mortal? So why is Gabriel ""commiting suicide"" after his earthly mission has been accomplished?BTW, this movie is about Archangel Gabriel being sent to earth after his heavenly compatriots went missing during the battle to oust an evil one. I'm not quite sure how to rate this low-budget movie just yet. I guess it's OK."
4,I liked this movie a lot.,"I always love a movie about good vs. evil. Especially when Andy Whitfield is the good. I thought Gabriel moved a bit slow. For such a low budget film you would think they would have speeded up the plot a bit.However, for such a low budget film, I think they put a really good body of work out in this film. It kind of reminded me of sin city. I enjoyed the fight scenes. Wish there were more of them. I imagine it looses some of it's effect on a 19 inch computer screen. Would have loved to have seen this in a theater. Would love to see it brought to the states and put on big screen."
4,A must read for most every woman.,"A well written book which sheds light on the root cause of ""need to shop"" behaviors. The book reads like a fun novel but very intelligently written with loads of information. Most anyone will benefit from reading this book."
4,Lot's of great ideas,"Yes, Orange County has Disneyland, the Knott's Berry Farm, and all those other wonderful tourist destinations. But where to go with the family when you don't want spend hundreds of dollars? How about a county park where you can dig fossils. Maybe tour of an envelope factory. Or perhaps you already have some ideas and want to know what are the best kid campgrounds and beaches, when the local festivals happen, or which musuem is best for your crew. It's all here. A great book full of ideas and places to spend an afternoon with your kids -- or without them!"
5,Worked very well!,"This product worked very well. Where we live, there are lots of wasps and we need to kill them quickly. We can not always wait for dusk to spray the wasps."
5,Keyless Remote,"This purchase was awsome! I didn't have to do much. It came with instructions that were simple. I still use til this day, I am very happy."
5,Keyless Remote Clicker works GREAT and priced great!,I wholeheartedly recommend this product and this vendor. The Keyless Entry Remote Fob Clicker for my 2003 Ford Expedition got here very quickly (in about 3 days on standard shipping). It cost less than $10 (compared to the $60+ the dealership wanted). Programming was simple. Instructions were clear. Works great. Now I'm wondering why I waited around for several months without getting one! Definitely happy with this purchase.
4,great size,"nice size, light weight but cheaply made. quality is fair-good, not great. the reservoir falls off easily and it was hard to get the handle to fold. I do not travel much so it is fine for when I do."
4,A travel through time,For History nuts like me this is a great colection. Only problem is that I had bought some earlier colections and found them to be compleate in this searies so check the wording closely to see what you already have so you don't end up with doubles. But a great colection of leaders how empires were built and so much more worth every penny.
3,Interesting,"While visiting Austria a few months back, I was exposed to these guys and it is very interesting music. Fun and bubblegummish, great to dance to. Except all the lyrics are in German. I would buy their stuff if I could find it out here."
2,Commercial Line???,"When I read a product with ""commercial"" or ""contractor"" I think its more powerful then the normal homeowners equivalent of the same brand. This product was worse then the normal homeowners kind I had to buy from Target after this didn't clear my drain. I saw slight improvement and thats why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Don't pay extra for this product."
2,purchaser,"I purchased this pen for my Daughter who is a Judge. And the top keeps falling apart. It won't stay on! I would not buy this product again, if this company doesn't replace this defective pen.would someone get back to me? ThanksJanet"
2,Good but there are much better.,"A easy to read, informative book with great lists and sheets but preachy to say the least. The authors of the book seem more concerned how your guests want the wedding to be than what the bride wants. For example, they suggest a French manicure, light pink or another pale color because ""Fire-engine red might be fun for the honey-moon, but it will probably raise eyebrows during the ceremony."" They go further by saying wearing perfume for your wedding is a bad idea because one of the guests may be allergic. While practical this is the couples wedding, not the guests wedding.If you want you wedding to truly be you ""own"" skip this book. However, if you like to be told what to do, right down to the underthings you wear then this is the book for you."
5,David Daniels has the most glorious countertenor voice I've ever heard!,"Beats even the great Peter Pears of old--could listen to this man sing forever! Do yourself a favor and get his first album of Handel arias, as well."
3,SOOOOO DISAPOINTED,THIS TOY IS SO BULKY AND HARD TO MANUVER FOR SMALL/YOUNG HANDS. TOO HEAVY AND HARD TO FIGHT WITH (EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE JUST PRETENDING) BATTERIES DRAIN QUICKLY AND NOISE IS ANNOYING. A BIG WASTE OF MONEY!
3,"Adequate, not great","Let's Go is an extremely reputable series of guide books, and are among the best in large city coverage. That being said, Let's Go 2004: Spain and Portugal falls flat ina few key areas. Foremost in this regard is covergae outside of the larger cities. Unlike The Rough Guide to Spain, the main competitor with this book, let's go seems to almost gloss over several rural areas well worth visiting. In several parts, especially cultural background and dining, the information seems too generalized to be of any use to anyone other than the standard day-tripper from one of the larger cities. By no means do I mean this is not a well-written and informative book. It is simply that it is a notch below what we have come to expect from these excellent guides."
3,Too distracting,"Being very excited to read the autobiography of a great saint in God's kingdom, I was looking forward to reading this book. The actual autobiography, I realized has EVERY PARAGRAPH NUMBERED!?! It is so distracting that I'm looking for another version."
5,Learning how to deal with some tough choices,"The book is a remarkably lucid explanation of why and how you should discuss the end of life with family members. It is a combination of practical ""how to"" and ""what is"" information about the kinds of choices that have to be made with terminal illness with examples of how real people have faced these choices. It is written with a somewhat wry humor and great compassion, from the experience of the authors, who work in the hospice movement, their own families and friends. Based on the notion that difficult, personal issues should be discussed over a kitchen table (or wherever everyone is most comfortable), it is essential reading for anyone who has older parents or who themselves will become old (which means pretty much everyone who is an adult). Highly recommended."
5,"The twins big brother, is in love again!!!","If you read big brother on love again? ahve you read big brother in love???That's the first part, about steven fill in love with jill hay, but, instead his in love with Cathy. Why not read both of the books, and find out!!!You don't want to miss all the fun???Do you????"
3,"Useful for Production Engg students, not all topics covered","The book is good. It has the requisite number of solvedproblems and most of the topics of material forming suchas Fundamentals, Forging, Drawing, Extrusion, Sheet MetalWorking are coveredwith clear cut mathematical derivations, but topics likeAdvanced Metal Forming (High Energy Rate Forming, Flow Forming..)aren`t covered. Latest techniques like Liquid metal Forging,No Draft forging are missing.Overall, it is a necessity for all Production Engg studentsbut not completely exhaustive."
1,"Norton Ghost - don't buy, look elsewhere",Many of the instrustions are poorly written. On making the (most have recovery disk) the computer crashes to the blue screen of death. very poor support. Actually no support - the details I will not go into. Look elsewhere for a better program.
1,Does not clone,"I used to like Ghost because it clones well when upgrading hard drives. I bought the version 12 and expected it to work well, but it failed to clone my hard drives in 3 computers. It always stoped at 99% and failed. Do not purchase this software unless you test this function. I had to use Acronis' True image to get the job done without any problem."
5,Nice looking quality grips,"I bought these to replace the stock grips on my Pt99. The grips installed without any problems. The pointability and recovery from recoil for the second shot has improved with the installation of these great looking grips. Now thats what I call real ""Gun Control""."
5,Missonary Doreen Irving is unforgettable,Missonary Doreen Irving is a fantastic person. I was a young lad out of high school when I first heard her testimony of being freed from satanism and witchcraft that was over 20 years ago. Today what she said still leaves an indelible impression on me. Her lessons have helped me even beyond what I could realize. Please get her books you will learn things that will stay with you for a lifetime.
3,Not the same picture,"The mouse pad I received does not have the same picture as the one put on Amazon. The one I received has a much closer view of a ligthouse, it only shows the top. I will try to take a picture and post it. I still like the one I received due to me just genuinely being a fan of lighthouses. But it's just the idea that they show one picture and then give you another one completely different. It's not the thickest mousepad I've ever bought. It's actually very thin for most mousepads I have ever paid money for. It's about half as thick. Overall it's okay due to it's still a lighthouse and it's still a mousepad so it still does it's job."
5,THE RAREST OF GEMS,"This book is superb, and like nothing I've ever read. It's memoire, it's history, it's poetry, and it's like entering the heart and mind of a young girl in China's Cultural Revolution. It's funny, moving, heartbreaking even, and so very beautiful I've kept my copy with me everywhere I go. I think it's a mistake putting this in any age group. It's truly timeless and yes, some young readers will be delighted to read this, but so will adults of every age. If you're looking for a special gift for someone, this book is just about perfect. What more can I say? This is pure writing at its very best, and ""Little Green"" will be around forever."
3,Extremely Powerful Revelation,"Simply put, The Ark of the Covenant is very possibly one of the most important books of all time, 2nd only to the Bible.The book is a veritable keystone which completes the picture of Jesus Christ as the genuine Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.If anyone is reading this review is interested in the book and a copy is unavailable at Amazon, you can find the book from a handful of websites (e.g. Anchor Stone, Wyatt Archaeological Research, and Jonathan Gray's archaeologyanswers site).In my estimation, the work done by Ronald Wyatt and Jonathan Gray is too important not be read."
3,Good.,"This is a pretty good CD. It's a bit weird that so many tracks don't include the actual names of the songs (#24 is ""Pa Janvier""/""Pauline"", etc.). And it's a typical soundtrack-type album in the sense of being a little incoherent."
3,Rock Around The Clock,"This Classic Album is a steal at this price,NO collection should be without it,These guys created Rock and Roll and here they are at their very best.Paul Bye"
2,"Tons of errors, rushed","I have to agree with many of the reviews. The book seems rushed - tons of errors, material is not covered very well.The explanation of the AXIS architecture is good, but that's about the only part of the book that I liked.The case study has too many errors."
1,Ripped wide off!!,"Boy, was I disappointed!!The editing just plain sucks, every effect in the book was used, slo-mo, jerky movements, fake colors, and so much of it!It's not really watchable, my girlfriend left after fifteen minutes, luckily it's a short video so I didn't have to wait much myself.I'm sorry to say that I feel ripped off but it's the truth.The other review was positively glowing so I felt compelled to give my take on this video, It's not fun to bash anyone like this but other buyers have a right to know that not everyone that bought this video is satisfied.The video has a very homemade feel but for all the wrong reasons, they just went nuts editing it. It's gonna look SOOO old in a few years time."
3,Most overlays are the same deal,"Expecting these plastic overlays to be perfect on such a large surface is a little crazy. You will have bubbles no matter how careful you are. The back doesn't cover the whole thing, but that is by design. Since it is a curved surface it wouldn't stick otherwise. So with that in mind it covers the back as it should without lifting up on the curve. As for the front, bubbles all around. Try to avoid getting hairs under there. Use non-powdered gloves and if you have some kind of little card to help guide it would help tremendously. It takes some patience to get the thing on correctly. It's overpriced, but it does do what it is made to do. (Prevent screen scratches)."
1,I never got it!,"I never received this book. The venderIsle of Passion: A Novelsold it and then refunded my money, saying they did not have one."
3,Maybe more than 20 per package...,"I would like to see the single flavor Zipfizz available in more than 20 per package. Although, the item did arrive in in a very timely manner."
5,The Handbook of Digital Publishing Two Volume Set by Michael,"""Michael Kleper's The Handbook of Digital Publishing is by far the best, and most complete, publication on this subject anywhere. This is the knowledge library of digital publishing. It will always be on my desk and is my reference source. Brilliantly written by one of the, if not the most, knowledgeable experts in this area. A must for everyone in our industry. Well done, Michael."""
2,Not good for pot lids,"Since the lids for most pots have a handle on the top, they do not fit unless you use every other slot. I suppose it would be OK to hold plates. I was disappointed because I purchased it specifically for lids."
1,Discontinued for a good reason,"This product has been discontinued most likely because the on/off button keeps falling off. I have had to replace three under warranty. The first two times, they were accusatory and said their research showed toothpaste was breaking down the rubber. Huh?The last time, they sent the R710 to replace it, which is not comparable to the 9500. The R710 has only one brush head, no cord storage in the base, and no sensitive setting. The R732 has the extras including two brush heads, but Sonicare refused to send it.So I have to go out and buy three brush heads (they don't sell singles)and live with a lesser product because Sonicare makes bad products and doesn't honor their warranty. I'll never buy a Sonicare again."
5,sonicare,"We have multiples in my home and we just love them---In fact, I stopped using one a few years back and my periodontist said to start using it again--so here I am and it's great>"
3,On-Off Button splits and breaks on Sonicare - water damage,"I am on my 3rd one. 1st I bought from my dentist, on/off button split, then I bought the set of 2 from costco. Second one split, now the third one is splitting. There is a design defect on this model."
3,Cleans like a champ,"Still using it today. The brush heads are a little expensive, but I use them for 6 months. If you brush carefully and gently, they will longer and clear better."
3,Nice Christmas gift,I got this for Christmas and it's nice. I used it already and my teeth felt incredible. I would totally recommend this to anyone. It's great quality and works very smoothly.
4,clean mouth feeling,"I am using my Sonicare toothbrush at least once a day and certainly like the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth. It is easy to understand the directions for using it. Another feature, after the intial charging, it is always ready to be used."
5,"Pricey, but it works.","A friend recommended this to me. I was wary about spending this much on a toothbrush, but I'm a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for"", and this lives up to the hype. I like the timer, the brush is easy to grip and use, and the battery really does last a full 2 weeks between charges. It actually makes me want to brush more often because you just get a really clean feeling after using it."
5,A Very Good Buy,"I'm very happy with this model after the origianl SoniCare I owned. I can reach behind my back molars so easily. The few negative reviews are whiners. The one with the torn on off button must have dug his finger nail into it to tear it the way it was torn in his picture. I'm very pleased with this model that I use every day now, not like my other original model that was not as comfortable to use. Nice electronic features also."
5,Good Grief!,"Is there anything good that can possibly come from the experience of grief? While most grief books often focus decidely on the grim, this author finds humor to be a healer of her heart. If you are grieving, you too will find something to smile about as you read her story of recovery from the loss of her husband through taking on a new pet and embracing the wisdom of her most-admired president, Harry Truman. This book transcends its categorization, however, as a grief recovery book. Anyone would enjoy it!"
5,A Perfect Little Book,"This wonderful treasure of a book will have you laughing out loud one minute and reaching for the kleenex the next. It doesn't matter if you have lost someone dear to you or not, whether you own a dog or even if you know nothing about Harry Truman, this book's universal theme of finding your way back after a loss of any kind, will stay with you long after the last page. I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,"nice size, insulates well","I bought this bottle to pack smoothies in a child's lunch box. It keeps the smoothie cold, and the wide mouth makes it easy to drink from, unlike the sippy-type bottles we've tried. It's also completely watertight.It's basically a small, slim thermos. Very nice."
1,Horrible!,I was so disappointed. Bought this due to great reviews but the scent isn't even nice. It smells cheap and is. The cap on the bottle doesn't open properly. I don't even want to use it for a room spray! Buyers beware.
2,totally confused,"Im dumbfounded by the reviews on this perfume, because most of them say it has a clean fresh scent. So i purchased it and it smells very musty and thick. nothing clean, fresh or crisp about it. I took it to work to see if if was me and asked how others thought it smelled and they said, old, musty, nasty, etc. out of 23 people, not a one said clean or fresh. So Im confused by the reviews here."
1,what happened to the scent in design??,"For years I LOVED design,LOVED it!! Recently I have returned 6 bottles. The scent is NOT the same! I bought a bottle from TJMAXX, thinking someone tampered with Amazons bottles. The one from TJMAXX is also lousy. What hashappened to this wonderul parfum?? I looked and looked for some address to contact the company but cannot findanything. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,fake,i bought this pruduct because ive used it before and i love the way it smells so i desided to buy it from amazon the price was great but when i got it i new it was not the real thing it looks so cheap the box is fake and the botle is not even done wright i cant beleave they are selling this stuff do not buy it
5,my 82 year old aunt LOVES this perfume,I order it for her birthday and she asks for more because she gets so many complements on it. It is her favorite.
5,I desperately want to read this book again!!,"I was about 18 years old when I first read this book: I was attracted to the book at first by the author's name, having grown up with his satirical songs, but after having read the book, I found him to be nothing short of a philosophical genius. I have since lost my copy, and am searching EVERYWHERE for an available copy. If anyone knows of one, PLEASE let me know!!"
5,Best book I've ever read.,"My best friend found a dusty old copy of this book in a box in his parents' attic when we were kids. He read it and passed it on to me with the caveat, ""If you don't have my book in hand, don't ever bother coming back."" This was 15 years ago. My friend and I still quote passages from the book almost every time we see each other. I was fortunate to find a paperback version of the same book in a used bookstore some years ago. I paid $2.50 for it, although I would have gladly paid 100 times that price for this rare, insightful piece of art. This book is not for the ""virgin ears"" of the religious right. It fact, it gets downright raunchy at times. (One chapter is titled, ""Short Chapter, Long Footnote."" The ""chapter"" consists of one word -- f*ck.) I consider myself a well-read bibliophile, and this book is unquestionably my favorite."
3,Good Value,"This was a replacement lock for a rental house - fortunately, I was able to get the same lock set that was being replaced, so installation was a snap. The old set had lost a lot of its luster, and the handle on the outside didn't work any more (why it was replaced), but it was about 8 years old. Not sure if that's a good lifespan or not, but for the price, it didn't seem unreasonable."
2,Be Careful!,"This audio book is abridged. It has only 3 hours of listening time. It is a British production, and the abridging is mentioned in tiny print on the back of the case. After discovering this, I purchased the unabridged version, and found it had eleven and a half hours. If you do not like abridgments, do NOT buy this version!!"
5,As promised,"This was relatively simple, I needed MiniDV tapes for my Panasonic PV-GS80 camcorder and these fit the bill."
3,Mini Tapes,This was a gift for my daughter and her husband to go with the camcorder we bought them. They said they were happy with it.
1,I will NOT order from this vendor again!!!!!!,"I received the wrong item. Instead of the 60 minutes MiniDV I received a 30 minutes MiniDV that was ""not"" Re-writable. My son had already opened it and it was going to cost me more money and time to returned it. ""I AM VERY DISCONTENT""."
3,Ok quality - my SONY tapes worked better,"Ok quality - my SONY tapes worked better. First time when I replayed the recording, there were horizontal lines on screen. Had to rewind and replay one more time before it got clear. It was scary because it was the only footage I had from my Los Cabos vacation.."
5,What a great buy!,"I've been having fun making tapes of weddings, parties, etc. I'll be ordering more tapes soon! I was thrilled at the price, delivery time, and quality of the product!"
5,"Fondly remembered stories, which are great fun to read","Ignore the John Q. Idiot review. I read the JLA #100 crossover when I was 10 years old, and I had no problem sorting out the multiverse concept and which version of a character came from which earth.Len Wein did a great run on JLA. Included are the JLA #100 crossover, where the JLA and JSA travel through time to rescue the members of the Seven Soldiers of Victory, the crossover introduced the Freedom Fighters of Earth X, where the Axis won World War Two, the story revealing the tragic fate of Sandman's sidekick Sandy, and more. No, there are no borderline psychotic ""heroes"" or ""kewl"" graphic violence in these stories. They are from a ""simpler"" time, but are much better plotted than most of what one sees in comics today."
4,Awesome ideas to spark inspiration!,This is the first Donna Downey book I have bought. I first bought it to make the photo blocks which appear on the cover. The only thing was that the size stipulated in the book aren't a size you can just go buy. No plank of wood comes in that size to simply cut it. You would need someone with some good power tools to get it to the size mentioned. I ended up making mine smaller with blocks I could buy individually at a craft store. There are some really great ideas in this book though. I have made more than one coin folder screen for gifts and everyone loves them. There are a few projects that use things you cant find just anywhere. For example a vintage printers drawer or a watch makers tin. The good thing that Donna does in her book is tell you where she gets her materials even if its getting them off ebay! I plan on trying one of her other books very soon!
2,Not Impressed,"I was looking forward to this album after hearing ""She don't love me like you"" but was not as happy with it as I thought I would be. It was a gift so I only heard it once."
5,Great CD,"If you like Stars or the Arcade Fire, you'll love these guys. Just sweet chill music. My favorite is ""Morning Eleven"", ""the Mule"", and ""forever lost"". Great CD"
2,Truly Gutless,"The book involves the usual hand-wringing about a loss of things like moral truth in an age of skepticism and relativism. But then Armesto, having described the situation disapprovingly, knows better than to step forward and state that there is indeed such a thing as absolute truth, to tell his readers what it is and then to demonstrate it in such a way as to convince us all what it is. This is a telling failure for someone writing a book titled A Guide for the Perplexed. It ought to convince any perplexed reader that fervent belief in the truth is no evidence of the truth and that all the different truths Armesto describes is stunning evidence that moral relativism is the only real truth any honest person can accept. Besides, when Armesto laments the decline of moral truth, who does he think is responsible for more bloodshed, moral relativists or moral absolutists?"
1,The timer did not work and caused the breaker to trip in the house.,Tripped breaker when I plugged it in. Feels cheap. I dont think it was damaged during shipping because the packaging was good. must be a manufacturing defect.
1,Awful,"The thesis of this text may be true but the statistics used to ""prove"" it are hogwash. Mr. Craig should plot the proportions of pilots who crash against flight time instead of the raw numbers. Bad use of statistics."
4,Great book to keep as a reference and a reminder!,"When I first read the book, my confidence level dropped because I am in this ""Killing Zone"". In the begining it does make you think that no matter what, if you have less than 350 hours, your chances of getting killed are pretty good.What I do like about the book is - it is a great review of basic aviation knowledge. He breaks down the the reasons of why pilots die. It's all about the basics and not becoming complacent. It gets you thinking. It reminds you that like a car you don't have the opportunity to pull over and evaluate the situation.I recommend the book to all pilots and especially student pilots. It is a good reality check for all pilots and students. Above all it is the type of book you keep on the side as a reference.The statistics need to be updated."
1,"Poorly packaged, damaged goods","I received this CD in a flimsy padded envelope. When I opened the envelope, the CD case fell out in pieces. I put the CD on the player and it barely got into the first track when it started to sound like an old record, with the needle stuck in a groove. I returned it, but I wrapped in bubble wrap and put it in a box. It's not like Amazon to package items this poorly."
4,Better than average Boxing history book from 70s...,"If you can find this book, I recommend it. It is better than Gilbert Odd's ""Boxing: The Great Champions"" and John Durant's ""The Heavyweight Champions"" overall, and I learned more from it than the other two combined. Definitely worth a pick up if you want to read about Boxing's Heavyweight champions until George Foreman."
2,Shuffleboard,"Good price, but the quality was not what I expected. It did not appear to be professionally made or assembled. Product returned."
3,"a little choppy, but okay","This book is part of a long series of point-counterpoint essays ranging from pornography to immigration to developing nations. So many books either talk about desegregation alone, mixed-race marriages alone, or multiracial children alone. This book brings all those themes together under the interracial label. The essays in this book are short. In fact, some are quite choppy. They are mostly reprints from magazines and oftentimes the title in this anthology does not fairly represent the words of the specific contributors. Still, this book has some well-known, excellent writers here. For people sensitive about racial mixing, the point-counterpoint approach may be painful: you have been warned. Still, this was a good introductory book for people, especially young students, to start thinking about various race-related issues. I would have edited this anthology much differently, but it's still a kiind okay book."
5,Belldandy never fails to delight,"Heartwarming and fun story. Season 2 continues the story Keichi and his Goddness Belldandy. The second season starts off right and really touches on their relationship.Characters: I love all Ah my Goddess Characters: Keichi, Belldandy, Urd and Sculd. Urd is like a big sister who always given Keichi great advice and help him with Belldandy.The season also started to build on Belldandys love for earth and Keichi. I think this is the sweetest anime made."
3,"absorbs well, but has an unpleasant odor","These absorb very well, but the smell of the fabric is a turnoff. Even after several washings, it is still there. I've purchased other microfiber towels in the past that did not have this problem."
1,Not recommended,The dish towel arrived defective with loose threads hanging from it. This is a very bad quality.
4,Good....,"I liked this better than some of the later Alex Rider books, but it still left something to desire...."
3,bond,"I suggest this book if you like action but not too much. It was a page-turner because you wanted to know what would happen next. I did not connect to the character because he did not seem like me or anything. People who like James Bond, but without the main character using guns would enjoy reading the book because Alex never uses a gun in the book."
4,Look Out,"The book was good but, some of the stuff I didnt like was that every chapater it feels like it skips a lot. But some things I like about it has action and you have to use your brain to understand this story."
4,Point Blanc Review,"Point Blanc is my favourite Alex Rider book. It has a brilliant plot and is very well written. With the brilliant descriptions it feels like you are under the surveillance of evil Dr Grief and you are trying to find out how sixteen trouble makers suddenly turn out to be model students. The death of two of their parents keeps haunting you. Unfortunately when you call for help none comes, and this may mean the end of your sleuthing!The whole book is wonderful, but the ending stands out a mile. Anthony Horowitz gives you clues that are almost impossible to find. Point Blanc keeps you guessing even after you have finished the book."
4,An OK Book,"I think that this book could have been better. I don't think it was very exciting for some parts, but it got better at the end. It's not the best book in the series, but it's worth it to read it."
1,"typos, confusing answers in this book!","Just finished this book as a review before taking the NCLEX. Anyone using this book should be aware that there are typos and/or wrong answers given for test questions, both in the book and on the CD. An example of this would be the book (and/or CD) stating that ""B"" is the correct choice for a mulitiple choice question...but when the reader reads the details as to why B is the correct choice, the book/CD contraindicates itself, and the reader can see that B is not the correct answer at all. I found this happening on multiple test questions, both in the book and on the CD, enough to where I can't trust the book to offer a reliable practice test, which it what the book touts. Very disappointing. Stick to other NCLEX review books for more accuracy."
5,Love it.,Easy to read. Packed with info. The CD NCLEX mock test has been very helpful to me in identifying my weakness. I'm an RT in a bridge program to nursing. I just started the program. I took 150 questions of the CD mock test so far. I got about 70% correct. My weakness seemed to be mostly in non respiratory pharmacology. I'm hitting that topic hard now.
4,Worth getting,"I'm in Fundamentals of Nursing and this book has definately helped me since our test questions are done ""NCLEX Style"". After getting a D on my very first test I ordered it. Took my second test and got a B. It is right on the money in getting you to think through the question and what is really being asked. Lots of good info. Highly recommend."
2,Bad Skimmer,"First let me start with the fact that when I got this skimmer the venturi piece was broken. I tried to fix it with everything, but to no avail. It kept leaking when I shut it off. Then the peice broke completely draining half my tank onto the floor. i called the company and they told me that peice commonly breaks. they sent me a new one, and I was very carful when putting it on. Now the peice above it leaks, and I cannot get it to stop. Do yourself a favor. Spend the extra money. Your fish are worth it."
5,Piacere (Pee-ah-CHAIR-ay),"This is the Italian word and pronunciation for ""pleasure,"" as in, ""It was a pleasure."" The author taught me how to say it correctly. I'm trying to say it with what she describes as ""attitude."" This was a pleasure read. You can almost hear the church bells clanging, smell the pure Tuscan air, taste the Porchetta (whole, roasted pig.) There are nuggets about Italian wine and Majolica and the Etruscans and much more. The author has the gift of folding you into her family. I feel that I am part of it now."
1,Big Mistake,"These questions are misleading - I ordered one book, and received and paid for two - I have sent emails complaining, and all I get back (weeks later) is this stupid email asking me to rate the book - which book? - where were you when I asked how I got two books? And how do I correct this? - but NO, instead you send me this idiotic questionaire about ""the book"" I received - is anybody there? Are you people there, or am I talking to a computer? You pretend to care, but it appears you are just robots - HOW DID I GET TWO BOOKS, AFTER ORDERING ONE, PAY FOR TWO and GET ZERO RESPONSE TO MY QUESTIONS?!! Your computer generated concern is phony - the books were fine, Amazon is suspect!"
5,CAPTIVATED,"I was in a world of exotic sunrise. These four women are truly talented. Ms. Small's Ecstay was the bomb. I really enjoyed the characters and the love story all together. Susan Johnson is still one of my favorite writers because of her love scenes, and she did not disappoint me at all. Thea Devine's, Dark Desires had me wishing for a man to make me submit, Sorry my opinion. Love the Plot it is a must to read this story. This was my first story by Robin Schone, and I liked the plot and the love scenes.If you like eroctic stories this book is a must. I hope that these four will be paired again in future books."
3,Fascinated is better,"Captivated is worth the price of admission ONLY if you are an Erotica specialist. The sequel ""Fascinated"" is almost twice as good. The stories are all better, and the sex is hotter. Fascinated also has (oddly) better romance. When a writer has the ability in the short format to combine Equally the romance and the steam IMO then you have a great book. Captivated falls short in that department."
2,Not particularly erotic!,"Out of the 4 stories, only Small's was what I would call erotic. And, there was certainly no romance in the story! Johnson's section was just boring, and not worth reading and I didn't finish it. Devine's story might have been sexy, had there been some romance to it. Schone's story was somewhat slow and not what I would call erotic. An unusal sex act for a male and female pair of lovers, is a far cry from eroticism to me! However, the story made the best stab at being a romantic tale. All four authors are talented enough to have done better."
5,Review of Mike and a Lynx Named Kitty,I really enjoyed this book. I found it to be heart-warming and inspiring. I am a librarian and am going to recommend it to all of my young patrons! I plan to read it to both of my daughters and know that it will become a family favorite.
4,A First Novel Worth Reading,"This gentle tale of Mikk's journey from awkward child to performance master and the conflict of art vs. censorship at the hands of the galactic-powers-that-be was an unexpected pleasure. The resolution of Mikk's fate and Waitman's intriguing cast of alien races held me throughout the whole entertaining ride. This book is a breath of fresh air in a marketplace of bloated, pedestrian SF tomes. Folks expecting sweeping space battles or a hard science fix may come away from Merro Tree wanting. Most everyone else should be prepared to sit back and enjoy this impressive first novel. It will be interesting to see whether Waitman takes as much care with her next book."
4,Not bad,"I got this tool for removing the battery in my rv as it is in a tight spot. It seems to do the trick pretty well. I found the same tool for half the price at an auto parts store about a month later,"
4,Super Reader,"A multi-sided political struggle develops. Humans, the Tuatha De Danaan, and the Fomorii. These are all basically opposed to each other, but the Dragon sibling group seeks an alliance with sympathetic Tuatha to help them do something about the problems that beset them.The problem they have is that some of the others are quite nihilistic, or don't really want to do anything. God psychology can be tricky."
5,The essence and completion of Basic Channel,"Basic Channel provided the raw material and Scion extracted the essence of it, to produce techno so complete that one is left with the feeling that nothing substantial can ever be added.Track 1 is one of the most sublime pieces of techno ever produced, and the rest seems almost insignificant in comparison, even though it is also superb. Some tracks seem a bit cluttered, opposing the minimalism of the originals. However, this in some ways emulate a live mix at a dance event, so it seems perfectly natural to have a bit of pace and a full soundscape.Basic Channel was the frontier to which techno was pushed at the middle of the 90s. Their marriage of dub and techno was so complete that it took almost ten years before anyone managed to take this type of music further; I believe it has only been done by Fluxion, Deepchord and Octex."
2,My cat was not a fan until...,"My cat was not a fan of this until I tied it on a string and hung it on his ""luxury suite"". He would have nothing to do with it before... even with the cat nip. I dont think he likes the cat nip... he sniffs peoples shoes longer than he sniffs that thing. It is a cute toy and maybe better for cats who love cat nip. For now he plays with it if it is swinging above him."
5,Great toy...,"My cats really like this toy. The feathers have not fallen out, even after having it for several weeks. The catnip scent is strong. There is a velcro pocket within the toy in which you can replace the catnip."
4,They've destroyed it with lovin',My cats love this toy. We have three cats and they love this toy. The only problem is that they have loved this toy to tatters. They licked it until they removed the fabric and got to the center......kind of like a tootsie pop!
2,Poor image quality,"The book has a great selection of Greene & Greene houses and design elements. Unfortunately, the image quality is poor. The lighting is often poor to begin with, and the attempt to correct for it in post production was not done properly in many cases, the result of which is a posterized effect and a loss of overall depth, contrast, and sharpness. The color balance is off leaving most of the rich, reddish mahogany and other woods looking green and flat. It's possible that all of this is the fault of the book's Printer, in which case I feel sorry for the photographer. Been there......"
1,Ok at first but then...,I enjoyed this product for some time until I could not open this USB drive to plug it into my computer.I would suggest that you look for this product with another vendor.
4,"Hot & Steamy, but Plot Not Fully Developed","This book had alot of promise- unlikely ""man-eater"" gets the hunk in an ultra-romantic Tuscany setting. But right from the get-go, I thought the author rushed into the courtship between Lilly & Trevor. Trevor went from belittling Lilly before the fashion show to dragging her back to his pad, then Italy, and subsequently marrying her in a span of less than one week. Talk about whirlwind romance!Overall, I enjoyed the book- it was spicey, hot, and romantic. But I feel it would have been a better read had the author developed more the romance between the main characters."
5,Review: Strawberry Road,"Rome Jordan is a benign and somewhat ordinary guy, burdened with family and career concerns typical of middle-aged executive-types who gradually become aware that their lives are lacking in substance. Without warning, his world is turned upside down, and he must muster the courage and resources to confront a succession of threats to his and his family's safety. Moore is a talented writer who knows how to weave a complex series of events onto a thrilling tale of personal courage and resilience. Readers will find this suspenseful account of a man's struggle for survival against seemingly overwhelming odds to be both entertaining and enlightening."
1,They break way to easily,"I have never had a vacuum belt break until I purchased my model vacuum and had to use this belt. The belts feel to rigid, that may be why they are breaking."
3,South Pacific,South Pacific has two songs that are cut off on the cd. Just a few words of the song and it is gone.
4,"A cute story, not as good as the original","While I enjoyed reading this story to my young daughters, it isn't as good as the original. My 2 and a half year old twins LOVE the ""pasta song"" and continually ask me to sing it - so it was worth purchasing."
4,Our kids love these!,"We got these a couple years back and our kids love them. We give them to our kids one at a time for birthdays and Christmas, and they're some of their favorite videos. I grew up reading these books and buying the videos was actually cheaper than buying all of the books individually because there are 4-6 books on each DVD. Don't worry... my kids still read plenty the traditional way, but they enjoy seeing the classic illustrations animated and hearing it dramatized and with music. We have also purchased other Scholastic videos that aren't in this collection. If you can afford these, get them. Our family loves them."
1,Videos won't play,"DVD's do not work with my dvd player, only on my laptop. :( I like the videos however, Sarah is great."
2,Not a good microphone for the money,"Had this microphone been stereo and not monaural, I might have rated it higher. The sound quality wasn't bad, but it was only in one channel. For this price, you shouldn't have to add a stereo adapter to the mike's plug or mix the audio to stereo in post. I sent it back and bought another Rode Videomic. Very pleased with the Rode."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","The idea is great. The only problem is, it isn't high enough to clear the battery terminals and tops for the water (marine battery). My father, who I bought it for, had a hard time getting his hand all the way around the handle. If it was about 6 inches taller, it would be perfect."
3,Short...but compelling (Review refers to CD),"""Washington Schlepped Here"" is a better then average spoken tour of our nation's capital. Drawing on his experience as a former Washingtonian, Reagan administration bureaucrat and novelist, Buckley gives the listener a quirky tour of many of the special places in D.C. The author's emphasis on the Lincoln assassination sites alone makes this CD a great addition to anyones collection. I expected this book to be cynical and demeaning to various figures from Washington's past. However, Mr. Buckley delivers a city filled with honor, courage and sacrifice. The spoken CD therefore balances idealism with a healthy dose of skepticism. Although it is supposed to be used in conjunction with a tour of Washington, it can be listened to without traveling through D.C. Overall, a compelling, albeit short, tour of many interesting places in and around our capital."
5,Children sit comfortably,"This the second one I bought for my daughter. The first one, as the baby grew, hunched her forward and she wasn't comforatble & would get cranky after a few minutes (very stressful). Then we bought this one and she loves it. It reclines safely (one handed while driving), durable for the weight of older children and she's not doubled forward. The first car-seat was a waste of money - this is worth every penny."
2,"Nice looking, but an absolute PAIN TO CLEAN!!!!","We've had this seat a few months now and our child seems to enjoy it just fine.Unfortunately, Cosco ""engineers"" must have failed to realize that children do, at times, tend to throw-up, sling milk, stuff cheez-its and overall, trash a car seat over time.So I brought the old car seat in tonight to clean and let me tell you, you'll need a set of blue prints and a tool chest to get this thing prepped for the wash. It took me about a half-hour to pull the cushion off and I'm no slouch as a handy-man.So unless your OK with your car smelling like old milk or your child has perfect dining habits, look for a better design.So come on Cosco - Seriously!!!"
2,Problems With Child's Neck,"I am unhappy with the reclining feature on this carseat. Every time my child falls asleep her head falls forward because I am unable to get the seat to recline any further. I am returning, and, I paid $170 for this seat in the store. Will try a different brand."
2,I Had To Return It!,"I bought this booster for my 3yr old because I wanted to give her Britax seat to her younger sister. I loved the look, and the adjustable armrest. However, the latch system was not easy to use. I could not get the latch straps tight enough and the booster was moving all over the place. When I tried to use the 3rd anchor for the top of the booster the strap popped off when I was tighting the anchor strap! I returned this seat and went back to Britax...I don't even know why the heck I left!"
3,Good seat but misleading for some,"I registered for this seat and received it at my baby shower back in November. I am a first time mom and when i saw this it said for children 22-100 lbs so the other day, I decided to switch my 5 mo old son who is 20 lbs and 27"" long into it. It turns out this seat is ONLY forward facing! So it cannot be used for children that small. It was a tiny bit mmisleading because of the weight and a lot of babies are 22 lbs way before their 1st birthday! So, if you are looking for this for your child under ONE YEAR OLD...look elsewhere. Look likes an ok seat though !"
3,SHORT HISTORY OF EARLY ISLAM,"This book gives us a broad look at Islam during its formative years from the time of Muhammed to the fall of Baghdad in 1258. It covers Islamic politics, theology and trade as well as the major events of the period.Although I did not find this book to be as interesting as many others, it is worth the read. It is also recommended for those who only want a quick survey of this important period in Islamic history."
1,Vastly overrated,Characters and situations not credible. Characters almost without exception unpleasent and unlikable.
4,Better than I thought I would be,"I purchased this book after reading several reviews and wasn't sure how it would measure up to North of Montana, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I have to admit I enjoyed it alot more than I thought I might. Originally, I was a little skeptical about the story line, and there were a few far reaches with some of the characters (Galinis was a little hard to believe and to get a feel for)but overall it had a good pace and keep my attention with great baseball insight and several well written characters. I would recommend this to other fans of April Smith."
3,OK but Wanted More,"I am a huge baseball fan and enjoy reading a lot so I thought ""Be The One"" would be right in my wheelhouse. Female baseball scout Cassidy Sanderson discovers an 18-year old potential phenom who becomes entangled in a mysterious blackmail scheme. Seemed interesting enough.Though the book was a quick read it just didn't click for me. The elements of baseball were good but the storyline seemed to move very slowly. I thought that author April Smith had many transitional passages that didn't advance the plot and thus diluted much of the action and suspense. Definitely not a page-turner.This was my first April Smith novel. She seems to have a following that enjoys her books so I will likely try some of her other works. ""Be The One"" just wasn't the right one for me to start with."
4,BEWARE...TREE DOES NOT LIGHT,"This a great piece by Department 56 BUT the tree does not light up! Per the company, the box misrepresents the product and the tree was never intended to light. But I didn't get the piece for this feature. I wanted it for the cute skaters that circle the tree, so that is why I rated it so high."
1,Another person with a switch failure,"I have five of these. I bought one and liked it a lot. Then I bought 4 more for various places in the office and studio. It's bright if you put it close to what you are working. And it puts off less heat than a CF bulb, which is to say that it is really cool.But, in the first lamp I have had the failure that was described in an earlier review. It began flickering then shut off. It now will stay lit for about 30 seconds when you first turn it on and then shuts itself off. The high rating on MTBF on the LEDs is meaningless if the switch only lasts six months.I am going to see what the scoop is on repair. If I can get it repaired, I'll up my rating, because when the light works it is great. If not, I will give it 0 stars and wait for my investment in these lights to be worthless in another x months."
1,Worst Guide EVER!!!,"This is the worst guide that I have ever seen. A guide is supposed to ""Guide"" you through the game. This guide only shows you pictures of selected items such as the stage layout, creatures, and boss's. This is not a step by step manual to assist you through the game. I had to resort to an online website to assist me with the game. Whoever wrote this guide should hang their head in shame. As for most of the other people who wrote reviews, they wrote a review about the game, not the guide. How could anyone give this guide anything more than 1 star?"
3,The Everything Baby Shower Book,"This book is well laid out with a large and varied amount of information, with plans for having formal baby showers to simple and casual ones. However, I found that it is lacking in recipe/food ideas, and that many of the games are those found in the plethora of other shower books available. I also found editing errors, such as (pg 203) a reference to ""the bride"" as opposed to the ""new mom""... since this is a baby shower book, I felt that this was evidence of poor editing. It also does not do a good job of addressing the newer trend of men attending showers, or of dealing with having a teenage baby shower. Unfortunately, this is a realistic need, and is what I'm looking for. I did find several games that they will probably enjoy, guys included, but other than ""Mystery Guest"", nothing that I didn't find somewhere else. I am not impressed with this book, but will be using it anyway. It's not bad, but others are probably as good for less money."
2,A Waste of Money!,"I bought this book with the intention of using it to help planmy sister's baby shower. With the exception of one or two ideas,I found the book to be of little use. I would recommend browsing through it at a bookstore (with pen and paper in hand)or borrowing it from someone and saving the money to use towardsthe shower you are planning."
3,I dunno....,it looks good... but it was for a friend of mine that i broke when i stepped on it by accidently...
2,buzz lightyear nightlight,My son loved this nightlight but soon after use the buzz character broke off of it and was to tiny to hold again with glue.The light it makes is very dim.Great look for a themed room but not a useful nightlight.The ones with the actual bulb make better light for nighttime trips to the bathroom or for the kids that are scared of the dark.
4,"Not miraculous, but a bargain for anyone with HDTV","Anyone with an HDTV and a Wii should own these cables. Current info is that no successor to the Wii will be released any time soon. Previous rumors of a high-definition upgrade to the Wii have been denied by Nintendo at trade shows and in interviews. Getting 480p resolution is the best you can do, and it is worth the small investment in these cables to do so. Making a whole collection of games look better instead of spending the same money (actually, a little more money) on one more game seems like the smart decision here.My TV is just a 32 inch 720p HDTV. The difference in image quality is noticeable."
4,"The cables worked well, quick shipping, Thank you!",The cables added some crispness to the image and having the Nintendo certificate of approval helps me with peace of mind. Recommended for Wii players on an HDTV setup.
4,Subtle improvement - Not HD Quality,"I bought this expecting a noticeable improvement in picture quality, which I did receive. I knew it would not be close to HD quality, but compared to the Xbox or PS2 its still a long ways to go."
4,I think you need these for HDTVs,I have friend who use the standard composite cables with their HDTVs. I think everything looks washed out with those and these cables help make last-gen graphics at least seem tolerable on modern sets.
4,HD For Wii Dummies,"With the success of HDTV systems all over, many need to upgrade inorder to play their favorite video games in high-definition. That case needs to be shown with all systems, including the Nintendo Wii. Although the Wii has a audio/video cable, there needs to be a specialty one for those who have those new televisions. This one that Nintendo made is very convient, and has the highest quality in service to function well with the new system. It is easy to setup and is worth its money. Although there are other companies that have made other specialty cables for HDTV's for the Wii, you're only bet is to stick with this one from Nintendo.Price: B+Quality: AOverall: B+"
3,Component Video Cable,Cable is excellent. Should have come with game by default. Only problem is that it is shorter than needed when attached to a flat panel on the wall. Don't know if it would work ok extending it.
4,Wii component cables,"I was able to pick these up for about half the price of them new in the store. Just wish the packaging was a bit upgraded. Seller did not specify with a original box / packaging and it was not included, would have been happier with it."
4,Once again...,"I'm a tad too old for this. Most of the complaints for this book are the same as the last book, though the strengths are still there. The conversion scene was well done, to my way of thinking. However, I still do not understand why assaulting an unwary opponent from behind is a bad thing. I've probably read too much military fiction, but still. I don't get it. A pretty good book, though."
1,The Occult Cannot be Christianized,"Another sad example of trying to make occultic material ""Christian"" and somehow, therefore, acceptable and less offensive to God Almighty. Wrong! The spirit of Harry Potter under any other name and any other religion is still the rebellious occultic spirit of Harry Potter, no matter how ""Christian"" you try to make it. Evangelize the devil and he will still be the devil when all is said and done. Don't let this book deceive you if you are a Christian. The new age movement is sneaking into our churches through this kind of literature. It tries to make the dark occult world look innocent as if by adding scripture or a ""Christian"" theme changes it. It looks innocent on the surface or at a glance, but it isn't. Don't be deceived. Read what the Bible has to say about sorcery and the occult. God is very clear and serious about what He thinks of it. He never changes His mind on moral absolutes."
5,Jakob Dylan's Voice is Better Than Chocolate,"This was my first Wallflowers CD. I love Bob Dylan, and when I found out his son was in this band, I thought I'd give it a shot. I intended to buy Red Letter Days when I went to the store, but ended up buying Rebel, Sweetheart instead. I'm glad I did. It's my favorite album. It's one of those great CDs where you don't have to skip over any of the tracks, because they're all so good. My personal favorite is ""God Says Nothing Back,"" but it certainly runs a close race with all the other songs. If you get the chance, buy the dual-disc version. You get to see the band play their classic, ""One Headlight"" and a song that never ended up an album, ""Halo,"" among others. Jakob and the other band members meld really well, both as vocalists and instrumentalists. Now go buy this CD."
5,Solid MB with good expansion,"Great feature set, with lots of expansion headroom. Ready for next gen Intel CPUs. Four DDR2 slots, and when you're ready to upgrade to DDR3 memory, this has two slots. Lots of USB. Onboard audio is good. Good performer.Linux users: The onboard LAN and RAID (this is software RAID, not hardware RAID) are fine for Windows (Intel provides the chipset's (ICH9R) drivers), but if you're using Linux, disable RAID in the BIOS settings and stick with Linux software RAID--Intel does not provide the chipset (RAID/SATA) drivers for Linux, nor does Gigabyte. For networking, I always install good quality Ethernet cards and avoid the integrated LAN."
2,Not so great,"I loved this the first trip I brought it on. It was easy to inflate and stayed pretty well inflated for a four day camping trip. But the second time I got it out, it completely deflated during the night. It made for a very uncomfortable weekend. I searched for the leak to patch it, but never found it. I later heard from others that air mattresses with built in pumps have a habit if having leaky seams around the pump. It has a warranty, but you have to ship it to Coleman. It's cheaper to buy a new one than to deal with shipping costs. I'm sticking with Coleman air mattresses, but I won't ever buy one with a built in pump again."
4,Fun Read,"I read this book, thinking that it would be an addition to my List Mania list: Belly Bump Books: Chick Lit You'll Love. I was a bit surprised to find that pregnancy doesn't hit the pages until the book is almost over (I'm not giving anything away - just look at the title!). Despite that, I found this to be a fun, light book- perfect for the beach or on vacation. Even though I didn't want to, I really came to love Venus and I adore her Faux Pa, Whitman. Filled with intrigue suspense, and yes, true love, this is a great read."
1,eternity moment perfume,i have a feeling it's not a genuine eternity moment calvin klein perfume. will not buy again perfume on your site. sorry
3,Nice,"Sweet, feminine and subtle, its a lovely perfume, which is inoffensive and thus suitable for most occasions. The top notes of the perfume are floral and it dries down to a Litchi note, which distinguishes it from a flat floral scent. Nice sillage, I could smell it on me for 24 hours.Its missing a wow factor, but its a nice clean fragrance which can be worn almost anywhere."
5,A must read for those interested in Kumeyaay ethnography,"A solitary piece of the tragic Kumeyaay mosaic is preserved in the autobiography of Delfina Cuero. This simple woman's account of survival as her world and worldview are swept away by an unstoppable deluge of European newcomers is touching and heart wrenching. It's also a shameful indictment of the horrendous treatment these fellow humans received from successive waves of Spanish, Mexican and American conquerors. Necessary reading for anyone interested in our indigenous history."
5,Contains the greatest tune for lifting spirits ever written ...............,"It is rare that I remember where I was when I first heard a particular instrumental recording.But I can tell you that I heard ""Leap!"" from this cd 17 years ago on an afternoon FM radio program. And it still remains the most uplifting tune I have ever heard.I immediately bought the cd and found other lovely tunes, like ""Elegy"", a beautiful tribute, thanks in large measure to the exceptional cello playing of David Lockington.I simply can't imagine not owning this cd. I know some people experience dark times, and to them I say that if you have ""Leap!"" on a portable music player, then you have an endless supply of the most powerful anti-depressant on the face of the earth, with no adverse side effects."
2,Game could be fun but...,"This game is like a Gta game army style. You can run steal tanks, jeeps, humves, chopters, ect. The shooting is good but not awsome, the graphics are a little under par compared to Splinter cell and Ghost recon, Sound is a little above what i thought it would be, Game play is where this game shines This game has so much to do in missions but the buggs and annoyances bring this game down"
1,worst printer ever,"Ok, it's not very expensive. But it is still a complete waste of money. I'm so tired of page after page of lines smudged into complete illegibility. It's not even good for printing rough drafts (the reason I bought it). I'm throwing this printer in the garbage and buying something (anything) else. A 20-year-old dot-matrix printer would be an improvement."
1,WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN HORSE DROPPINGS.,"PRINTED OUT FOUR (4) PAGES AND QUIT ON ACCOUNT OF REQUIRING A NEW COLOR INK CARTRIDGE. HEY FOLKS, IT IS BRAND NEW! THE PRINTER LASTED ALL OF TEN (10) MINUTES. TWO HOURS OF SCREWING AROUND WITH THE INK AND ZERO (0) TECH SUPPORT SENT THIS PILE OF MANURE TO THE DUMPSTER."
2,Pretty cheap,"I think it was good in it's day, back in 2003. But now, it is not compatible with new Windows 7. Had problems with it recognizing new ink cartridges. Then, could not install both updated printer driver and installation software. And the ink cartridges dry up fast and are expensive to replace. Definitely time for an upgrade! I wouldn't invest in this printer."
2,Not going to get again,It is a very loud whistle but took much more breath to create the noise then it should have. I also didn't think i'd mind the different shape of the whistle but it does feel awkward. Maybe with extended use I'd become more comfortable with it but unfortunately i'm not going to put in much with it.
5,I need a part 2 !! What an Eye Opener!,"The best first person account you will ever read! ""Because you are a girl"" will take you through the most excting and informative reading you have ever dont of an auto biography. You can feel the authors words come to life. its like they are being repeated to you in person. If you like giving books as gifts, then this should be at the top of your list!"
5,fun and educational!,"This is a great idea for kids who are proud of their savings and want to put it in more than a wallet! I rated it fun because it so cool to put the money in and you get a password. some have little swipe cards also. It looks awesome too! I rated it as educational because it teaches kids what ""deposit"" mean and ""withdrawl."" It also teaches kids how to almost run a bank and teaches them responsibility to keep track of their money. I have heard that the money doesnt always go in and u have to open it to put them in but other than that I really do think this is a great toy! Parents:buy this for your child for christmas!! Kids:put this on your wish list!"
1,What a piece of junk!,"I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas. There was no way to make the bill feeder work. He was sorely disappointed, and I had to return the item for a refund. Don't waste your money."
1,Where can i get one?,to whoever owns these ttoys. i was wondering if this toy wil every come ut in asutralia. i live in australia and i would be very very very interested in buying one.Will they ever come out here? could you please notify me if they do.(i only have 1 star cause i havent played with one before
2,Don't mess up,"If you make even the slightest mistake, as the previous reviewer said, you will have more air bubbles under the protector than you know what to do with. I too will likely throw mine away."
5,brave new films,Excellent!! A real eye-opener. A must see collection for anyone who wants to learn the real truth behind some of the most important issues of the day.
4,Helped get me through multivariable calculus,"The textbook I had for multivariable calculus was absolutely worthless, so I really leaned on this and the Calculus 3 tutor volume 1 and 2 DVD set to help figure out how to do the problems. It does not cover everything you will see in class, it hits the most important topics and gives several examples. If you are in Calculus 2, this is not really going to help much. It is almost exclusively things you are going to see in multivariable calculus. You will get some of the sequence and series material you will get at the very end of calculus 2, but it does not go into all the integration techniques you will learn there."
4,Read Edited Version,"I originally read the hardcover and it wasn't too bad. I've just recently read the paperback and there was a huge improvement in grammatical errors. I actually enjoyed the story much more this time around because there were very few mistakes if any.Yeah the plot is a little out there and the characters could have been developed a little more, but I think overall it was a decent read. So if you haven't read this book yet, I suggest reading it as a paperback because 1. it's cheaper and 2. it seems the publisher had the book edited this time around lol."
5,"Unrealistic, but I loved it","I disagree with those who called the book trach. It wasn't very realistic, but the story was entirely too sweet. Nicholas truly loved Camille and the dialogue was passionate. The love scenes were steamy-- I truly enjoyed it."
2,1st A Comment Then A Suggestion,"A Twist of Fate is quite predictable but still readable.The best interracial story I ever read was An Infrequent Pairing by SaFiya Dalilah. An Infrequent Pairing is a synergism of fact and fiction that takes the reader on a journey through the lives of a young interracial couple- Naomi Jones (Black) and Dillon Brady (White/ Irish American). It examines their beginnings and unlikely meeting at an HBCU (Howard University) to romance and marriage. The story is not without life's tribulations. Death, adversity and triumph. Naomi and Dillon exemplify resilience in the face of opposition from family and public scorn. Their love is enduring and contagious. This novel can truly be appreciated for its real life references and insight into a couple based on the author's true life experiences."
1,Wolf Whistle,"not a very good horn, it is not as loud as i thought it would be and the whistle is very slow and it did not come with any wiring for the button or a button its self.. but after purchasing everything install was very easy... i would not recommend this horn to anyone get a better quality horn"
3,Journey 2:The Mysterious Island,"It was ok for kides, know a good movies,make cheap, movies not make good,no storeis life, will want know one to rent, no want no one to rent or buy"
2,A Sleeper,We fell asleep watching the movie or it was watching us... did not see the entire movie tried to watch it twice but fell asleep both times.
2,Boring!,"All I can say after looking at the movie and all the 5 star reviews...is ....have any of you ever seen a ""Good"" action/Scifi movie?! If you take away Dwayne's pecs and a little bit of computer graphics...you have a predictable shallow presentation! Don't waste your time!!! Godzilla is more entertaining!"
3,Trite story designed to show off sharp colorful 3D,"Sean (Josh Hutcherson) a rambunctious teen receives a mysterious encoded radio message that says the island is real. He assumes this is sent by his missing grandfather (Michael Caine.) Sean's stepfather (Dwayne Johnson) who is trying to get Sean's confidence enables Sean to go on a fantasy sojourn. As you guessed, it has to do with a mysterious island with strange animals. One strange animal that Sean tries to cotton to is Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens you may remember from the ""Robot Chicken"" (TV series)). Most of the story is interaction between the characters and interaction with the local creatures.Do not try to make sense of the film details. Just go with the flow. Enjoy the visuals as I believe that is why the movie was really made."
4,"Good, Light and Fun","I really enjoyed this film. I found it to be light, quick, fun, and a well orchestrated showing.Excellent for family viewing, yet provides a solid viewing experience for all ages."
4,The scenery is stunning,"Rented this to test our new Plasma HDTV after the rear projection died. Not only was the movie itself pretty good, the video colors were stunning. An enjoyable film."
4,Good family movie.,"My kids loved this movie and I did to right along with them. Do not expect this to be academy award type or ground breaking,it is what it is. Action adventure with the ROCK."
3,Pretty cheesy...,Sometimes you wonder how some movies ever get made. Who in their right minds would put up hard earned money to finance this thing? This is one of those movies...
3,Fair family fare!,"This is an fair enough way to pass a couple of hours as a family. A boy (Josh Hutcherson) is drawn to a mysterious island in the middle of the ocean and drags along his stepfather (Dwayne Johnson), a helicopter charter pilot (Luis Guzman), and the pilot's daughter (Vanessa Hudgens). The island is a biological anomaly with big animals being smaller and small animals being bigger. The film has to rely upon a lot of CGI, which even our kids noted ""looked fake.""When the island begins to sink into the ocean, the characters must work together to escape safely.Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) is good in these family films with his charming demeanor. And the kids enjoyed performances by Hutcherson and Hudgens.Outrageously unrealistic, but an okay film."
4,Journey 2,To me this was an enjoyable childrens movie. Not quite as good as the original movie. Do not regret the purchase
1,Pass on this one,"Even though the movie has a few ""big"" names in it, this one isn't worth the money. They shouldn't have tried to do a sequel to this movie. The first one was much better."
2,Pretty Lame,I know it was a fantasy movie but Dwayne Johnson has done better. This movie was pretty lame. Some of his lines were just plain stupid. But then other parts were not bad. Basically a movie for kids who don't know better and could care less.
3,"Fun for kids, in that cheesy way that kids seem to like","My sons, ages 9 and 11, thought this movie was hysterical. I was glad I had something else to do while they watched. I am a fan of Jules Verne and I think they tried to fit too much story into too little time. It's got a fairly good cast-- Michael Caine!-- but the goofy one-liners and pec-popping by The Rock was a little over top on the corny factor for me. The CGI is decent, but decidedly lower-budget. Good for the kids, but be ready to have some potty language repeated."
2,Just Okay,This movie was just okay. The visual effects looked fake. It did not keep my childs interest for long. The acting was subpar.
5,Journey 2:the mysterious island,Dvd arrived quickly and in great condition. Movie played kile a new one and storyline was excellentas a follow-up to the first movie. Thanks!!!
2,Movie OK but ON DEMAND gets D Grade,"Good movie for the kids, but the ""On Demand"" video quality on was poor: D rating, for the low resolution picture on 50"" HDTV since Amazon broadcast compressed file size (to save on capacity or to lure you to upgrade to HD quality)."
5,Greg is the man,"Greg was my teacher in college. He was a pretty cool guy. Anyways, this book is great; not to mention published in like 50 languages. What else is published in 50 languages? Uh, The Bible. Thats right, The Bible. Buy this book now."
3,Okay Mini Knife,"Decent knife for small applications. This knife is thin, small, and sharp. I can't say I carry it around, but for simple mundane tasks like opening letters or bags/thin packaging it is fine. Not your workhorse knife."
1,Not a good phone,"The sound quality was really poor, worse than Panasonic KX-TGA2224, which in turn is worse than GE 27998GE6, which is good, but not as good as those SONYs they have sadly stopped making (yes, I personally have tried all of these). There is a reason they are putting the price down. These things, if they sell, they get returned (like I am doing)."
5,Weidenbacher a no-nonsense uncommon Name,"Without reading this book I can recommend it because the author's grandfather has the same name as me and was my Uncle.The author had the good sense to get out of New Jersey and into the coal mining country of Pennnsylvania. Oddly enough one of my aunts by marraige family left the same area for Newark,NJ.Talked to John and he seems like he could write an interesting book. Leaving the Garden State shows good common sense.Semper FiWoodstockWeid.com"
1,not the same as before,Herdez salsa has a new paper label on the jar. It's not the same product. It seems to contain the same ingredients but the texture and the taste are different and I don't like it anymore. I loved their previous product but have thrown out my latest purchase. It sucks!
1,You have better things to do than to futz around with a CPU fan,"I can't speak to how this fan works because I never got that far. I realized after I installed it that I needed a 4-pin connecter instead of a 3-pin one. OK, that's my fault. But how is it that the negative reviews here on Amazon are more informative about how to uninstall this fan than anything that comes with the product? The box has a picture on it that's full of arrows and completely undecipherable -- do they tell us what to do with the push pins or show us the direction of the airflow? Not a single word. On the inside of the box or out. Not on their website either. Just pictures.Except for their brilliant marketing approach - it's tooless! Oy yay! Because goodness knows that those of us who are buying CPU fans to install ourselves are averse to using tools. And words. Thermaltake has us pegged."
1,Buy something else...,"I have had this fan for only a few months and the fan has already seized, making it useless. Dont waste your money."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I've gone the furniture-in-a-box route many times, and this lovely little table is by far the best piece I've ever purchased. The feel is solid and sturdy, and the design simple and pleasing. The assembly instructions have one mistake, however. The cam locks should be turned 1/2 turn clockwise, not 1/4 turn. If your table is wobbly, that instructional error could well be your problem."
2,Not as good as the previous efforts,"On this CD they backed off from the more synthesizer new-age sound thathad been her trademark. This album was practically a hip hop album,nothing really interesting or captivating on this one. I hope they canget back to doing stuff like 'Apples and Diamonds' and 'Tigerlily' andreally all the stuff that came BEFORE this one. That was the nicheBertine had, almost exclusively, and should continue developing."
4,Good Bag.,"I really like this bag, the only thing that I would change about it, is the color of the inside!"
2,Unconvincing and unmoving,"I bought this film hoping it would be a great cult masterpiece like the above reviews made it out to be, but i'm sorry i was sadly disappointed. I felt Martin Donovan was great as Matthew Slaughter but that's all the film had going for it in my opinion. I didn't laugh once, it wasn't funny at all. I guess it was too amatuerish, yeah that's a good word for it. Don't get me wrong, i loathe mainstream culture, film, music et al. But this film just lacks so many things, sorry."
4,"Interesting, quirky film","I love it when I find a movie whose ending eludes me until it actually occurs...and better yet, a film that is intriguing enough to engage the viewer without pulling any cheap tricks. This quiet, precise, immensely appealing film cannot be immediately labeled and categorized. I was (and am)fascinated by all the characters and am curious as to where they will be in 10 years...I'm passing this film on to several friends because I'm curious as to what their take on it will be."
4,Creative and funny.,"I don't like all of Hal Harley's films, but this one really struck me as quite good. It is a very orignal and creative tragi-comedy and has all the makings of and Indie-classic. The performances are hilarious, even though they look quite stale, but then I think that was the idea. Martin Donovan is a great actor in all of Hartley's films, and his Matthew character is incredibly unpredictable, which makes him one of the best screen characters I've ever seen."
5,Wonderful film - hard to say why!,"I love this movie. I am a big fan of Martin Donovan / Hal Hartley and consider this the best of both. I love the dry dialogue and the quirky music - they blend so well! This is an unusual movie, and it was my introduction into independent film years ago. It got me hooked on indy films and I love this type of cinema much more than the big-budget hollywood blow-outs. Do yourself a favor and chill out watching this for a couple hours, you won't be sorry!"
1,It's supposed to be a motion picture.. A MOTION PICTURE!!!,"It should have been a radio show. Fortunately, I didn't fall asleep, even though I wanted to.. so I can give you my full honest opinion: talk less, show more, don't be so self-consciously witty as to border on pretence. If you MUST own a Hal Hartley film, make it ""Henry Fool"". He's figured out these ropes much better in recent years. Better yet, go for a director that makes full use of the medium and get Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man"". If you must have lots of blabering, wait for ""Celebration"" (okay, so it's not in English, but you'll be wondering where your socks went). In the meantime let me know if I can get a refund on the two hours of my life I spent watching this thing."
3,Good/okay Korean horror film made better by striking visuals,"Unique, moody and well-shot little Korean horror film, about a young woman who starts a new job as a night attendant on a train - this particular train's last run, I think - on the night of her birthday. Sixteen years ago, a horrible accident on the same train resulted in the loss of 100+ lives, and some of the same cars from that train are still attached to this one ... which is maybe why, from when the train first starts its run, our attendant begins to see flashes of the old train on the night it crashed in 1988. Ghosts abound - or is she seeing things? The mysteries (and deaths) begin again, getting creepier as the train rolls on picking up more passengers (victims?) ... but in the end, the plot is a bit of a mish-mash that makes for a nice horror flick visually, but nothing you can really get emotionally attached to as a film. Average, worth a look if you like Asian horror films!"
3,It's okay,"Red Eye is an okay Korean Horror movie. The major problem I had with it is the pacing, it's really slow. And there are not enough scares."
1,Way Out,These supposed plots seem beyond credibility reason and rationality. I regret having bought this video. What a waste of money! Please do not buy.
3,Paranoia will destroy ya...,"you can't believe everyghing you see. I enjoyed this movie for the novelty, however, I find this pill a little hard to swallow."
5,EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD VIEW THIS FILM!,"This is a must see for every American, if we can pull our head out of the sand long enough.Alex Jones has done an amazing job here."
4,If u think this is good u should watch Jones' 911 Road to Tyranny Film,Huge Alex Jones fan. All his docus are very informative. He can come off as a bit extra at times. Highly recommend this also watch his 911 Road to tyranny one of his best works yet
5,False flag operations of the new world order,"This movie takes a very disturbing look into the false flag operations used by western governments as a pretext to obtain global control. This film will change your worldview into one that more closely reflects reality, a reality many would not wish to accept. It is a must see for all who value life and liberty."
5,Only if You Want to Know the TRUTH,"Some people don't want to know. Some people think they have it already.Some people's mind block it and will not let it in. There are others who by nature must know for themselves and are willing to investigate.Terrorstorm is for the latter group. The TRUTH is ugly. In fact a kind of ""worst case scenario"".America was conned AGAIN by warmongers!"
5,Terrorstorm should wake up the conspiracy deniers,"Terrorstorm is an important and courageous film whichshould wake up the conspiracy deniers from their mainstreamtrance.Like holocaust deniers and mafia deniers,conspiracy deniers dangerously providecover and flack for the defense of the standardoperating procedures of evil and deadly combinations.The power elite, the corporate elite, and secret police collaborationsare now so blatant in their criminality and lies that it takes an act ofwill comparable to Oedipus's self-blinding to deny their evil deeds.Alex Jones rips the mainstream veil off the history of false flag operations."
5,just what I was looking for,"Needed this sugar bowl to complete my set of Johnson Bros. Blue Willow. It's exactly what I was looking for, at the lowest price I could find. Arrived in half the expected shipping time. Thanks! Very happy with the transaction."
2,Doesné come with the pen,"I thougt this would be a very good educational gift. But guess what, it doesn't come with the pen. It should be written e large and huge letters. I felt cheated."
3,"Hardcore, film noir type stories (no average comic book!!)","With a gritty writing style, Brian Azzarello introduces the concept of untraceable bullets and the ability to do whatever you want with them. There are no average comic book stories in this graphic novel--they all deal with adult themes and language. The artwork is also gritty but it works well with these types of crime stories. The hispanic characters were all different with some good traits and bad traits. Now I have to read the 2nd graphic novel!!"
4,Chunky puzzle,My 4 year old son is delayed and chews on everything. That means that smaller puzzles quickly take a beating. He also has fine motor issues and these shapes make it easier for him to pick up.
5,Nice piece at a Nice price,"I picked up the table today and my husband put it together in a few minutes. I was pleased that it was made from real rubber wood which I learned is a renewable resource from rubber trees. Too often the term wood; is really particle board or manufactored wood. (code for sawdust and glue pressed together into sheets)It is placed behind my couch with two tall lamps on either side. It matches the Pergo floor underneath, and is a great value. It looks like a much more expensive table. The added shelf underneath is a great place to store magazines and books.I think this table will be around for several years!"
4,A few tips,"I really like my console table. I've purchased and assembled five pieces of furniture from the Mission Collection, and this piece was in fact a bit wobblier, but I think that's due to it's height. I've found that placing a dolop of wood glue in the dowel holes helps. I also tighten the camlocks with a screw gun, which gives you a tighter screw that just a hand-held screwdriver. I also suggest assembling the table without tightening any of the screws or camlocks, and then setting the table upright and stablizing it by applying pressure from the top. This prevents wobbling. After it's level, you can then tighten all of the screws and camlocks. This technique worked on the console table, coffee table, and end table. It's now very sturdy, and I even have four cats that are always jumping up on it."
1,Save your money - DO NOT BUY THIS TABLE,"I am SO upset with this table. Like some have said, this table is nice to look at. But it wobbles because the peices aren't secure. I put this together fairly easily - that's a plus - but it's so shaky that I'm afraid to put anything on top other than a lightweight lamp. I purchased several Mission style items from Target, assembled them all within a matter of minutes - but THIS table is the only one that is unsteady. Had the pegs from the bottom tier of the table not broken off when I tried to take the table apart, I would have finished disassembling it and taken it back to have my money returned. I will NEVER shop at Target again."
5,Great Sofa Table,"This table is great and VERY easy to put together. I put the table together myself with my 3 1/2 and 1 year old sons watching on very closely. My husband was surprised when he came home to find it all ready put together and in place. The only downfall was a tiny little chip on the edge of the top of the table, but I flipped it around and put it to the back and you don't even see it."
5,Spell Binding,"I was overjoyed to find this sensational album/CD. I have been truly enchanted by it since I got my first cassette of it 10 years ago. Spell binding, Rich weaves a a lush path of musical inner vision through the essence of all you imagine the rainforest to be. Here are the shadowed, secret trails deep through the jungle, the jaguar's lingering gaze, the dazzle of dappled sunlight over head in a catherdral of trees; crashing intensity of tropical rain, and the steamy mist rising all around you, shot through with the flaming colors of tropical flowers, birds and orchids. This recording is beyond New Age or Ambient alone, and to me is the benchmark against which I measure all other ""rainforest"" recordings."
4,Too wide.,"It's too wide to fit in the USB port of my computer (Dell) at work. The front panel of the computer where the USB port is recessed such that the DataTraveler hits the side and won't go in. Other than that, it works just fine."
2,"Good tips, but Depressing ""outlook""","I ordered this book after reading it at the library. I really enjoyed the easy to read format, and the tips for helping my son is what made me go ahead and order my own copy.HOWEVER,my large complaint is this is a depressing book! It gives the negative ""future"" of dyslexic children as limited to careers that dont require higher education. It goes on to talk about most dyslexics are dropouts, unemployed or at dead end minimum wage jobs.Obviously that is not true. While I'm sure many are, it is NOT the norm. Dyslexia does not limit possiblities. Yet, this book seems to focus on the negative rather that the positive that can happen with good intervention.It's still a good book, just ignore the negative and remember that your child's future isn't limited by dyslexia."
4,"Back to the Dietz ""universe""","William Dietz has long been one of my favorite authors and I've read almost all of his books. I'm particularly fond of his Sam McQuaid books. This book, Freehold, is set in the same universe. Dietz stays true to the premise and the universe that he created with this work. Hearkening back to many of his earlier works he fills Freehold with characters that you can buy into, villains that you love to hate and fast paced action sequences to keep you turning the pages. While some of the character development could be better, Dietz doesn't fall into the trap he did with the Legion series and ramble on for pages about politics. Rather, he creates a very enjoyable, and quick, read. If you've read Dietz before, I'd highly recommend this book. If you haven't read anything by Dietz, then this is a great book to start with if you want an enjoyable book."
3,Clunky - but seemingly effective,"I bought this a while back for my first iPod... I thought it was really clunky looking, and the silicon sleeve that fits on the iPod made it harder to use things like the hold button and dock. But it did seem like it protected the iPod well.When I lost my first iPod and ended up buying a replacement, I ordered a gelaskin instead. It is much prettier and I no longer have issues with getting it to dock or using the hold button, but it is probably less protected in case of falls and bumps."
4,very cliched but things work,"having listened to Led Zeppelin's music for years now I always wondered why a Group that had as strong a following as them&were a Huge Act kinda just fell off?this Book answers alot of that.while the Music would have been much more interesting fully brought out more this Book explores the Personalitys of the Band Members.it's Cliche ShowBiz Life,Sex,Drugs,&Rock&Roll&Ego tripping.this is the kind of Book that if you have a One-Sided View of a Act just based on there Talent you may or may not look at them the same.But aside from some Issues within themselves,they were still a Happening Band&that Made there Mark."
2,a big waste of paper,"Most readers, including myself, were disappointed with this book. I expected to read about Led Zeppelin's musical creations, not their several encounters with groupies. Although the groupies played a big part in the band's writing and behavior, we did not need to have every detail about what they did. Richard Cole talked more about groupies and his own life than any of the band members. I was hoping to learn what Led Zeppelin was like in the studio, on stage, etc., but this book was about trashing of hotel rooms, relations with women, and other useless information that had nothing to do with the great music they created. I was going to give this book to my thirteen year old son for his birthday, but after reading it, I realized it is NOT for young teens."
5,Zip Pole works just like they say it does,"I am a ceiling contractor and it is important to keep the dust inside our work space and not in other parts of the office areas. Also, we need to set up quick and not screw around trying to set up the visqueen. The Zip Pole is fast and easy and it does work just like they say."
3,Took Two Times,"It took two times for Amazon to get me the book I ordered in ""LARGE PRINT"". I'm not sure what the problem was. I ended up buying a used book. The book was in new condition. Just frustrating to receive wrong items."
4,Better than I thought it would be!,"I must say that I am a 33-year-old female DS user, and a mom to 2 boys (ages 10 and 7) who also have their own DS system. We all have a copy of this game. I didn't think that I would like the card-based battle system but I thought that I would give it a try, if only to be able to play multi-player with them. First of all, the game is absolutely adorable and the graphics are great. It's fun to see all of the Final Fantasy characters in a kid-friendly setting (we all liked Kingdom Hearts, too). The card-based play turned out to be really easy to get the hang of with this game. The mini-games can be tough for those of us who are beyond our best years of hand/eye coordination (but, hey, I rolled Asteroids when I was 8). I'm a bit behind the boys, but getting through the game anyway."
5,At last!,"Have been looking after this one for a very looong time. I have it in my hands now. And I still love this album. An E-M (electronic music) must have.Disc, artwork and overall condition was excellent. I highly recommend this merchant"
3,Mission Coffee Table,"I love this table in my Florida Room, but it has a couple of unnoticable scratches on the top. It's good for the money."
2,Wobbly,"I have 4 pieces from the Mission Collection, including several others in a different finish. I own this coffee table and it is very unsturdy. The end table is sturdy, the console table is sturdy, and the 4-shelf bookcase...but not this piece. It could definately be from my doing, maybe I didn't do the best assembly, I'm not sure, but I assembled all the other pieces myself as well and those are perfectly fine. I'd say for the price of this item, it is a great find. Just be sure you tighten the screws extra tight if possible, to avoid any problems, it might help in the long run. The quality of the wood is surprising, it's not cheap in my opinion, and it looks very good. I would say overall this item is worth the price, but watch out when putting it together, it might end up falling apart someday."
1,Don't waste your money.,"When I recieved this table, the package had been opened and taped shut again. After unpacking the parts, I found that one end piece of the table was broken. It looks like someone returned it to Target/Amazon and they just put it back on the shelf. Since it was shipped to me directly from Target, I don't blame Amazon. Target should know better than to screw their customers. Obviously I won't be shopping at Target again."
4,Informative,This book is very informative for those who are curious or interested in practicing UT. Most of the book is listing all the clinical research done over the years.
1,Disappointing,"The perfume is fading away VERY quickly. In fact, it is so lightly scented that even immediately after applying it I can barely smell it.I am not very fond of the fragrance either. It smells like washing up soap, not the usual fresh and invigorating smell of Arden's perfumes."
5,My mom loved it!,"My mom has loved this perfume for years. It is kind of hard to find, but I was happy to see it on Amazon. Fast shipping and packaged nicely.Thank you!"
1,I should have listen lol,"I always read the negative reviews first but I thought this is an Elizabeth Arden product how bad could it be, let's just say this is a mixture of bug spay and light flowers. Previous reviews were right about not seeing the Arden name anywhere on this product. This has to be a marketing ploy to sell this so buy at your own risk."
1,Not a Simmons Items - Counterfit,The item I received has a zerox copy of a simmons mattress label on the package and is made by another company. not quality. very sketchy!
4,Read it in one day,"This book has sat on my shelf for years after I read a review of it somewhere. I bought it when I saw it on sale but never picked it up to read, thinking it would be dry, textbook-like reading. I was so wrong! I had some time to read yesterday and opened the book for the first time--and I didn't stop until I'd read the entire thing! I wouldn't have thought that a book like this could be such a page-turner, but it was. I couldn't wait to read about the subject of Vollmann's next interview. There are a few egregious editorial mistakes (""all the sudden"" appears early on the book, followed by two strange instances where a female interview subject is referred to as male and vice versa) which threw me off a bit, but overall the book is remarkably well-written, full with facts and truly human stories. At times the chapter seem a bit disjointed, but Vollmann's real-life ""characters"" were so interesting it didn't bother me much. Overall an informative, enjoyable read."
3,Stylish hot box,"The carrier is well made and looks great. However, if you plan to transport your best friend for more than a few minutes, he/she may smother! It would have been a much nicer design if the back of the carrier was mesh too."
1,DO NOT BUY,The small is the only size airline aproved and the small is WAY TO SMALL for anything but a kittin. I returned this produce and got a full refund.
5,Excellent,"My girl loves this product. She loves going into it, the amount of room (I got the larger size); it's like a safe haven when we take car rides. And it is easy to sling over my shoulder when I want to carry other things. It has a leash inside so she can't get out. Very win win. Highly recommend. If one thing to change, they should have a zipper at the top of bag so I can reach my hand in and comfort her."
5,great,these movies are great i love gore gore gore gore gore gore gore night rider! it is worth it to get faceless alone
4,Effective Elucidated Evangelism,"This book is good for its intentions to reveal the secret of evangelism. Comfort talks about how to approach evangelism and get lasting results. Basically the secret to effective evangelism is not getting to people through emotions. The law of the Lord is what should bring people to Christ. Comfort explains the reason why this is not just an effective way, but it should be the only way. Going a different route leads to many ?back-sliders?, because of false conversion. He gives examples, in his experience, of people who have been effectively evangelized to and of people who haven?t. On the cover it says that everybody who has a burden for lost souls should have the book. I also say the same thing. If you truly want to bring people to Christ, and know it is a sure thing, you should buy this book."
3,Some misapplications of Scripture,"It is okay, but definately using scripture out of context to make points. I prefer the Bible to interpret itself."
2,Terrible Quality,"All I have to say is that I bought this for my friend, he dropped it once, and it broke. And it wouldnt turn back on. We tried everything. Horrible product, please dont buy."
4,Awesome,"This is the highest quality green laser I've ever seen. The only bad thing is that the laser quality slightly degrades over use, but a battery change may fix this. Overall, awesome product. And only $20 to, the other ones I've seen are at least $150. This one is on sale for $20! I've ordered three now, and they all work."
5,Great,This is a very informative book. It gives the reader a lot of detail. It is a great book for those wanting to fix or repair old radios.
3,Good quick read,"I am an avid reader of gay fiction and I enjoyed this book because it was different from others that I have read. Firelands is a quick read with lots of plot twists - some more believable than others. Just how often can one person be stabbed, frozen, assaulted, etc. and still survive? So if you are looking for a good book to cuddle up with, read one. But if you are looking for something in any way challenging, leave this one on the shelves."
5,Terry Fator,"Excellent product, excellent quality for what I need, shipped promptly, will be back. THANKS for the EXCELLENT service :) :)"
4,Terry Fator Live from Las Vegas,I live in Las Vegas but cannot afford to see the show so this DVD was great. I really enjoyed it and the quality was excellent.
5,Very Funny!!,"I first saw this DVD when I was in Vegas on the bus ride home from the Grand Canyon. I laughed the entire time. Terry Fator is, hands-down, one of THE most talented people I've ever seen! You forget his puppets aren't real people! This DVD is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to laugh. In case you're wondering about language/content, it's pretty clean. Some slightly off-color jokes and ""hell"" and ""jackass"" are the only things that might offend some people. Even if they do offend you, I would have to say, ""Get over it and watch this DVD!"" My favorite part is the Michael Jackson bit. And Vicki. Ya gotta love her!"
3,Its Okay...but I have reservations,"I like Terry Fator's Las Vegas Shows....with some reserve.I have followed his act from the time he burst on the scene at America's Got Talent with Emma Taylor singing Etta James. I watched him live at Utah State Fair 2007. I liked that it was clean, entertaining and a whole lot of fun.But when I watched him in Las Vegas he added sexual gags and references to marijuana. His newest puppet Vicky the Cougar was so crass with her sexual inuindos that I skipped it...and when my friend came over I let him know why I was skipping this part. This is not a DVD to watch with children in your family. Terry has compromised what made him famous in order to be popular."
5,Great Addition to a Wine Cellar,I have used this item with fascination. It does not replace chilling the wine but rather adds a fine touch just prior to serving. Beautiful device with presentation stand.
3,ok book,"I guess my son just isn't into these books. he's 7 and this isn't something that he just wants to do. when he's antsy i have him do this book instead of watching tv. he doesn't hate it, it just isn't interesting to him i guess"
3,24 hour banking for children is frustrating at times,"I got this for my 10-year old son's birthday. The best part of the bank is having the combination lock listed underneath. However it is very hard for my son to get it done correctly. He was confused with the words ""counter clockwise"" and it did not specify to go around twice.There is no way this can fit the amount of money it claims to. The safe area is very small with the door being tempermental at times and not easy to open up after doing the combination. The ATM card is useless.The key to having the balance portrayed accurately is you have to press the withdrawal amount when you take money out and press the deposit money button to input money.It is bulky and hard to find a place to store. Nice concept, but we were frustrated when the door opened slightly and then I smashed it to remove the money and tossed it out."
1,whatever!,"this thing is a peice of crap. when you put money you have to roll it in. so it is difficult to put money. and the code is on the bottom. i had a better atm than this from my parents, and it is like the real thing, but the wierd thing is that it is the same brand. i just got this one from my friend and i advise you to just get the other atm."
1,NOT A SAFETY BANK.. WASTE OF MONEY....,"THIS IS NOTHING LIKE A SAVING BANKIT CAN BE EASILY OPENED BY MANY WAYS,....THISTOY IS A WASTE OF MONEY NO ONE CAN SAVE MONEY IN THIS KINDA BANK.."
5,Help for teenagers who are hurting,My daughter was suffering bullying and terrible harassment. This book helped give her a perspective. The other thing that has helped her was the pyschology class she took which gave her an insight into why people act the way they do.
3,child's table; use caution,"This is an attractive little set and the price was right. However, a parent may want to fix some problems before letting their child use it. The seat slats are only stapled on, (as we discovered in a narrowly averted accident,) so I would recommend using screws on each of the slats and also checking all the fasteners, and gluing, nailing, etc. as needed."
1,Very disappointed,"The box it arrived in had large gashes torn from it, was re-taped with a remnant of ribbon embedded - obviously a returned gift. The set had been listed as new. Inspection of product - table damaged beyond repair. Very disappointed with order and especially the inconvenience of having to return this & find another. I will shop locally."
1,horrible,I thought I was renting a comedy not a irritation fest. there was nothing funny about anything that happened at least half way through it cause I couldn't finish watching it. Was this even in the theaters? I would be surprised if it was. Horrible not even worth renting. I was annoyed by the characters the situations and what they did from start to the point i stopped watching...
4,"Funny, but could have been funnier","This movie looked hilarious when I first saw the trailer. All the funny parts are there of course, but I feel that it could have been done better. Some scenes were very original such as stuff you've seen in all those new stupid movies like The Hangover, etc etc. But both actors do a fantastic job. They were both funny. I recommend just renting it."
3,Lollygagging,The storyline and situations feel contrived and clichéd. This movie wastes the great talent of Zach Galfinakis. He is the savior of this movie.
3,Pretty Funny!,"This was an ok movie! But it was not nearly as funny as I thought it would be! The Hangover all though not related to this movie, as everyone thinks. Was alot better and had alot more laughs!! And the classics like Plains Trains And Automobiles, The Great Outdoors, The Great Race. They will never be outdone by these newer comedy's. It was worth watching just to say you have seen it. But if you need a really good laugh. Don't expect this flick to make your eyes tear up and your sides hurt!!!"
2,Wasted opportunity.,"Due Date was a movie that had so much going for it and it just could not succeed. The acting was top notch. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Zack G. were excellent. There were some one off jokes that were just hysterical. But sadly the entire story is very weak. Some of the humor is forced and with such an uneven script the story is very weak. The movie does have some black humor and if they allowed the characters to be themselves then it would have been much funnier. As it is, Due Date is weak and so unfocused as to not be funny. Missing this would not be a tragedy."
3,SO/SO,"Barely three start. If I had stopped watching it somewhere around half way, I would have given it two! But, they through in a couple of twists in the plot that made me say, ""Oh, okay, I'll see how this turns out."" In hindsight, I have to wonder if they put them in after making the movie, saying to themselves, ""Wow, this movie needs help."" ;-)All in all, I'm SURE glad I didn't spend the $$$ to watch it in the theater. And, if you don't have ANYTHING else to watch on a Friday night, this will do, but, again, only if you don't have ANYTHING else to watch."
1,Broken within 24 hours,"The electronic safe is very cute, makes neat sounds when opening & closing. However, the hinges on the door are very flimsy! The weak post broke within the first 24 hours of play. My daughter is not a rough child, the toy is not well made. I will never purchase another product made by Summit products."
1,Music For A Suicide,"If you're depressed, stay away from this stuff. The ""music"" delves right to the core and irritates your marrow with its long sinuous lines of decadent atonality. This ""music"" would serve well as the soundtrack for the Jonestown Massacre or Heaven's Gate Cult as they commit their final act of mass suicide. It is unnerving & unsettling. It's a score that could only have been composed for wristcutters. Sorry, but that's how it touches me."
2,I did not received what I asked for.,i received two copies of the same CD. i had two disc 2's and no disc 3. I missed 5 episodes in the series because of it.
1,pourquoi??,Pourquoi le dvd de one tree hill ne se fais pas en francais...je cest quil a des subtile..mais moi je le veux en traduit en francais!! Si on en na au quebec y devrai y avoir une lois la dessus...traduction en francais...je veux pas lire mais ecouter le dvd! merci davance
5,UMMM.. SUSPENSFUL...,"I cannot wait for this to be released, I have been waiting since the end of the first season. I was so thrilled that they were making this into a DVD box set. So the first season was so sweet, what happened this season? Why the suspense? Not that I don't like it, but all the cliff hangers at the end of each show, I mean come on, I cant take this anymore. It is like they save the climax for the end, but yet it drags to the next episode. Anyways, I am just dragging on, I love this show and have seen every episode. Every twist is brillient and each show makes me want more. So give me more and release this DVD already!!"
5,Outstanding!,"This is, without a doubt, the best treatment of race relations during the Civil Rights era by any author, black or white. One factor of this novel that I found particularly intriguing was the contrast between the civilized, semi-aristocratic family portrayed in the book and the ""white trash"" and transplanted northerners in their midst. Overall, an underrated classic."
4,good movie,arrived very fast and to the west coast where i was visiting my sister for the holidays.. thank for sending it there for her and i t o enjoy
5,Great Story,Linda Hamilton is one of my favorite actors and teamed with Rob Stewart this is a fantastic tale of overcoming hurts and unearned hardships. A fantastic Christmas Storyl.
4,"Not the best script, but . . .","Not the best script, hairdos, or storyline, but hey, Linda Hamilton is in this movie. If you enjoy her versatile acting ability, you will enjoy this movie. I know, I know, it is somewhat corny and the daughter needs some lessons in humility and appreciation, the ex-husband deserves his childish new wife, but it is still worth watching. Linda Hamilton's character is somewhat naive and weak, but grows in determination and ability to survive some of the tough issues that come her way. For those of you who demand happy endings you will get one. Me, I just enjoy watching Linda Hamilton in just about any role she tackles."
4,Secret Love,"Brenda has done it again. This was a wonderfully written book about two wealthy individuals that come from different backgrounds, fell in love, overcome obstacles and remain in love, continuous growing love. What an inspiration. After reading this book, I have begun to look at my spouse with lust and count my blessings. Keep up the good work Brenda. Your creative style of writing makes reading your novels more enjyoable and imaginative"
5,The secret's out and it was worth the wait!,"Jake Madaris and Diamond Swain have been secretly married for almost two years. Brenda Jackson fans have been waiting for the secret to be revealed. It was definitely worth the wait. The book is divided into two parts: the meeting and courtship, and the unveiling of the secret. Jack and Diamond's story is red hot..."
4,"Secret Love deserves a ""Proper Unveiling""","Brenda Jackson, a leader among African American romance novelist, gives readers an outstanding tale of committment, patience, love and trust. Jacob Madaris is the type of seasoned man,who could convince a woman like myself who is not attracted to older men, to repent. Diamond Swain is so fortunate to meet and mate with this guy. Brenda weaves in a negative force in the form of the obssessed reporter, and while he did not harm Jacob, I could have missed his presence all together. The chemistry between Jacob and Diamond was conveyed in such a realistic manner, the reader had enough romance to appreciate, void of any impending violence. I am looking forward to the next novel by this acclaimed author."
2,I must have missed something,This is a boring and melancoly CD that will soon find it's way to the used CD store.
1,Never thought I could get an EXPIRED supplement!!!,I bought phytosolaire and got it about 2 weeks ago. After I took it for 2 weeks I was looking at the bottle and for some reason I checked the expiry date because it never occurred to me that I have to check and found that the supplement EXPIRED 11/2008.
5,DARE TO DREAM!,"Dare to dream--this is DREAM MAGIC'S ultimate message. By learning how to use our dreams' spiritual essence we can truly reclaim the night and put it to good use, manifesting love, prosperity, peace, and pleasure for our waking hours. Sirona Knight's dream rituals, spells, and down-to-earth advice makes this a welcome, if not essential, bedside book to warm our dreams, and help them come true!"
1,Great album,I really enjoed this album It is one of their best together. I highly recommend it. They haven't lost the magic touch! Hope there is another album by them They are one of rock's great duos!
5,Totally satisfied,My son was happy to receive this for Christmas and is enjoying watching it. He was very pleased with it.
3,Too Tiny!,"I have used a headset for years, and couldn't live without it! Radio Shack quit making them, and that is the brand I have bought for years and loved it. The Plantronics has tiny numbers, and when the phone fits into the base, it is nearly impossible to get out in time to get the call before the phone stops ringing!"
4,second one we have! works great,"Have one exactly the same for the past 2.5 years, works perfectly well, and now we got another one, since they are so comfortable. You can do dishes, clean floors, write on computer, everything - since it's hands free! Also can move around the house and the connection is still very good. recommended! wish they would make more types of these..."
1,Poor sound quality,"After having two Plantronic CT10 phones for years (both of which recently broke), I am very disappointed in this model.1. The sound quality is very poor -- there's a constant buzz in the background. I never had this problem with the CT10, so I know Plantronics can do better.2. You cannot use the phone while it is charging.3. I liked the clip on the old model, which could hook onto anything. This one will only slide over a belt or a pocket, and it is inclined to pop off.4. The keypad buttons are tiny and flat, so as you're dialing, you have little sense that you're hitting the right numbers."
2,Lot's of Wireless Networking issues,"I purchased this phone with high hopes of using it as my primary home office phone. The phone directly interferes around 50% of the time with my 802.11.B wireless network. Since the phone channel can not be fixed, the Plantronics CT12 will randomly knock me completely off the network. No amount of calls to Plantronics or fiddling with my wireless channels improves this problem. Thier answer is that the channels are choosen by the phone and there's nothing they can do. I've returned the phone for a refund.The other problem is that the phone can not be used while it's in the charging base, so you'll need to have another office phone for when the battery runs low.If it weren't for these two major issues, it's a nice phone with clear sound and the little red light on the mic boom is cute."
5,amazing range,I have had 1 of these for 2 years use it in a fabricating shop and i have dropped it numerious times with no damage to it. Sound quality is very good even when i am over 1500 feet from the base . yes it is a very good phone only wish it had a better belt clip on it
1,wish I had listened-doesn't work with wireless,I tried everything I could think of...but no luck. I kept getting bounced off the internet or off the phone. Either one is unacceptable. Back it goes...if you have wireless-trust the many reviews. Not worth the effort.
2,Stick with the CT10!,"I sent back the CT12! I can't use the speed dial feature on the Plantronics CT12 on an already-dialed line to access my voice mail, so I have to manually punch in my phone number with area code and # sign rather than hit one button. ARGH!!!You CAN do this on the older CT10 ! I have several long string numbers I frequently dial for conferences and international access, and I can do this with the CT10,using the MEM feature. Plus the CT12 you cannot use while it is in the charger base. The older CT10 you can pop it in the base, if your call runs long and the battery is depleted and carry on. I had replaced the CT10 because I really wanted the caller ID, but ended up returning the CT12 and just buying a supply of replacement batteries for my 10 YEAR OLD RELIABLE WORKHORSE CT10!!!! Because the CT10 is older, it DOES NOT interfere with my home wireless network. You can still pick up a new CT10 from people selling old stock on the internet, too."
2,"Too much static, causes Wireless drops","I had an old RadioShack 900Mhz Cordless Headset Phone that started to develop problems with the Headset wiring, so I purchased the CT12 even though there was some complaints about Wireless drops. Most said that this could be avoided by moving the channel that my AP, a LinkSys, broadcasts on. Well I have tried both channel 1 & 11 and this phone still causes intermittent drops. Worse than that, I was receiving way too much static unless you were real close to the base.Consequently, I returned the CT12, which was painless with Amazon, and have since started looking for a used CT10 (900 Mhz). Perhaps I just had a bad unit, but this didn't work for me."
3,Great but not in a wireless house,"Conflicts with my wireless router all the time, shuts down my entire network. I need to sell this to a wired only house, they would love it!"
1,I Was Disappointed,I was excited about getting a better phone. I do all my work on the phone and depend on it for my livelihood. I used this phone for one day before sending it back. I could not get the volume loud enough and I got an annoying background hum. I do better with a cheap cordless from Radio Shack. Oh well...
4,Kills wireless router network,"Great phone, nice size, nice sound quality but the red light blinking makes a little noise in the speaker but not bad. The thing that made me return it the same day, was within minutes of using it, my wirless network would crash and reboot. Not great when you work from home. Make sure you check the frequency your router uses before buying."
2,Plantronics - Disappointment in Purchase,"I purchased this plantronics headset to replace the CT version that I had for 3 years. I was disappointed with the fact that you cannot use the headset while it is in the charger charging the battery.you were able to do this on the prior version the CT10.Lots of nice bells and whistles, but the basic phone technology available on the earlier version has been reduced.Would think hard about buying this one....j"
4,Plantronics CT 12 Cordless Headset Phone with caller ID,I want to say that the Plantronics CT 12 is a fantastic phone. The reciption is very clear. Also it very easy to use. The phone is so much better that a regular phone becuase of the headset that comes with. It is so much easier using the headset that to use your shoulders or hands to hold the phone. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who is starting their own business.
5,This Book is a fitting tribute to our Queen: DAME ELIZABETH TAYLOR,This book by Gianni B. Is a fabulous tribute to the QUEEN OF HOLLYWOOD. I HAVE BOUGHT MOST OF THE CURRENT BOOKS ON DAME ELIZABETH & although all the photos are in black and white you can see the love in each photo. I miss seeing her stunning eyes in color but the candid shots Gianni took are priceless. I especially enjoyed the pictures of. Elizabeth with her children. A stunning cover too for the most beautiful woman ever. BRAVO GIANNI B.
2,Greek's Bridal Bargain,"I couldn't stand Bryony. She was so stuck up, and so stubborn and self-obsessed, I couldn't relate to her. I honestly didn't even care about her happiness, and more wanted to know about Kane's feelings and his life."
4,Not my favorite sort of music...,"Although I can see how this music would have wide appeal, I confess an enjoyment for quieter, more introspective music by the likes of Riley Lee, Anoushka Shankar, Kokin Gumi... shakuhachi flute is a favorite, and other zen-inspired stuff. Although this kind of soaring, uplifting, joyous and emotional music can be appealing, it isn't a favorite here, and thus I can't give it the highest rating -- any rating involves a bias. However, it seems to be among the finest of its type. Thanks for reading."
2,OKAY,"The game played fine, I just found it boring very quickly. I don't think it has enough challenges to keep it interesting."
5,The President's House: A History (2volume Set),"I first read volume 1 of this 2 book set of the history of the White House while on vacation in Florida over 20 years ago. I have since searched continually for the set......even searching on Amazon. I was so excited to see it finally pop up on Amazon....and immediately ordered my set. It is a PRIZE! It contains a very detailed history of the house itself, with all the changes it went through from the beginning, but also the story of all the First Families who have lived there up to and including President George Herbert Walker Bush. I could hardly put it down, but the way it is written...lends itself to occasional reading! I hightly recommend it! It is a treasure!"
3,A Comment about Mrs. Eisenhower showing Mrs. Kennedy around the White House in Dec. of l960.,"I have been reading Mr. Seale's book, 'The President's House"" and I found a very striking contextual error. In the section, in Volume II,about the Eisenhowers, the author explains that Mrs. Eisenhower pushesMrs. Kennedy around the living quarters in a wheel chair before the Kennedys move in; page335 of Volume II. In J.B. West's book, ""Upstairs at the White House""written with Mary Lynn Kotz, page 192-3, Mr. West relates to us thatMrs. Kennedy was not pushed around in a wheel chair by Mrs. Eisenhow and suffered for thislater when she had to recouperate from walking and standing too long after caesarean surgery. Mrs. Kennedy later relates this incident toMr. West and asks him where the wheel chair was,(cite p. 194 of West.s book.I was surprised to read this incongruency since Mr. Searle sites Mr.West's book in his bibliography.Mr. Searle has certainly cleaned up the story."
4,slow - be careful,First off - the product is good.Shipping was slow.Product came damaged - I called Masterbuilt for a replacement part - was told since I bought thru Amazon they considered that as 3rd party and were not supposed to warranty it. They did however 'make an exception' and send me the part. So if you do buy and have to call them don't say you got thru Amazon
1,One Word Discribes This Machine...,"CRAP!!!Seriously the worst fax machine I have ever owned, even worse then my terrible $59 brother!This can only fax a few pages at a time, 2 to be exact. Anything above that won't go through.SSSSLLLLOOOOOWWWW Printing and Faxing... Turtles walk faster than this thing prints and faxes!Printing out pics is a nightmare, granted this isn't really made for that type of printing, but if you decide to print out a small pic it looks terrible.Calling customer service is great until the operator starts talking and you can understand a darn thing he says. I've called several times so it wasn't a one time thing.All in all the worst purchase I ever made, and buying from staples I thought I was safe however they only have a 15 day return window. I will never purchase a Lexmark again!"
2,"OK, but that's it....","Nice little boat but very little little info in this book that cannot be found for free online. It is a basic boat without anything that would require someone to actually purchase the book (like I did) to build it. Many similar plans for basic boats such as this can be found for free online. It's not a bad reference book if you are truly a novice or collector, but nothing here will satisfy the intermediate or advanced craftsman."
5,Ipod Mini-Mount Pro-Fit,"Good product, arrived as expected.This mini-mount works great for Ipod Nano mounting.I have mounted these products in two different year model Camry's and could not imagine using my IPOD with out them.(Used metal mounting plate on the center console - sold separately for specific car models.)"
4,Works with Zune 80GB and HTC Touch Pro (Fuze),This fit my Zune 80GB perfectly with the mount's adjustable sides moved to their max setting. I was also able to hook up the Zune sync cable without the cable hitting the bottom adjustable feet. I was also able to use this with my HTC Touch Pro (also known as the AT&T Fuze). My Zune and Fuze are held firmly in the mount and I am even able to turn the mount upside down and my devices don't fall out.
5,I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!!!,"I was not prepared to read such a fine book. I knew it was the first book for Joan Taylor, but I had no ideal that a first book could be so good! The way the book was written, I could actually envision what the characters looked like. I literally wanted the book to keep going. This was one of the most entertaining books that I have read in a long time. Congratulations Joan Taylor."
1,Back when romance was all about rape,"I happened to run across Easy Connections at a used book store and picked it up. I wish I hadn't. This was not a good book, let alone a good love story. Dev should have been punished for his rape of Cathy, not rewarded. Guess what people, rape is a horrible reality, and enough women are blamed for their own rape in real life, we don't need to reinforce it in fiction. The way the whole thing was handled was both offensive and laughable. Is this the example we want to set for impressionable young adults? There is a reason this books is out of print, because it could never be published today."
3,Was getting good until the end,"I liked Easy Connections but I really hated the ending. Cathy should have gotten away instead of staying with Dev who will probably keep on hitting her and their son for the rest their life. I was sort of hoping Cathy escapes to the states and go to an art college theer where her wish comes true and she becomes a famous artist. So that supports Cathy and her baby. But noooo, the author had to go and make Cathy give up and give in to Dev who btw RAPED HER! So all in all the plot was good but the ending and some other parts of the storyline just needs some work."
5,Donna,Fantastic lease. Love the second handle that help me train my pit bull. Very sturdy & enjoy the blue color. 5 Star Seller *****
5,Great!,"Carrying on the series smoothly, CIRCLES OF SEVEN answers questions from the previous books and still leaves enough suspence to have readers on the edge of their seat, waiting until they get the next book in the series. Never start reading these books if you have a busy day ahead, and most certainly do NOT start them in the late evening! You'll want to finish it all, even on pain of not enough sleep.Very enjoyable, the series continues to be a very clean, Christian oriented fantasy series that even non-religious readers may be able to enjoy wholeheartedly."
5,follow the wind,"I enjoyed the book very much,it takes a rather in depth look at some very different personality characters,and as with real people they have their faults and failures as well as their good points. I found it to be a good character study of the effect love and kindness can have on peoples bad points."
1,I agree...SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"This video is not worth the money. It looks like (the person said before) a daycare where the parents dropped their kids off and did not even know they were being taped. This is a stupid tape. The only reason it got 1 star was because that was the lowest score I could give it. I am sorry but like they said, the box is VERY misleading!"
5,For the regular user who wants to understand Mac OS X,"This books covers most of what all regular users of Mac OS X might want to know - or at least be able to look up. It is written in an easy to understand way, without becoming too simple. It is matter of fact and clear. The book describes all parts of Mac OS X Panther, without making it too complicated. For most regular users the level of knowledge this books gives is quite enough - and some might say that it is even too much.I warmly recommend this book to anyone using Mac OS X who wants to know some more about the operating system and all that it involves. It also has some simple trouble-shooting, various tips, a very good listing in one of the appendixes of Where Did It Go? meaning some of the things in OS9 compared to Mac OS X Panther.I use this book for my courses about Mac OS X for regular users and have also used its two former versions."
3,not for theory challenged,Definitely not for the theory challenged as it includes only melody lines and chords -- not full arrangements. Great for auditions if you're working with a seasoned accompanist with solid chord theory and ability to play from charts. Otherwise your audition could trip up on a mediocre pianist scrambling to improvise.
3,Great Features but Disappointing Performance,"As a crock-pot owner and user for 20 years, this crock-pot seemed ideal. It had all the features I was looking for, plus many wonderful others. Unfortunatley, the lid doesn't fit well. I had read this in other reviews about other newer models, so was sure to be home during my first use. After a few hours of cooking a roast, I noticed a lot of water on my kitchen counter. Moisture was running down the inside of the lid and collecting on the rim of the pot and spitting out. I'm sad to say I'll be taking this one back to the store and pulling back out my 20 year-old model."
3,Christmas gift gone bad,"I was very excited to see a high tech crock pot under my tree, only to find out that it is difficult to manuever. The menu screen is hard to read and I don't believe there is over 200 recipes, its like uh...what are my options? Not only is there little choice really, the buttons don't exactly function well. You have to push them very hard and you have to be a magician to find that working spot. If you have lots of time, this unit is for you."
1,No Need,This was a waste of money or maybe we did not install properly the splice that comes with the Pet Safe Fence works great no need for this.
2,"Great plug-in, disappointing book","While CourseBuilder for Dreamweaver is a great plug-in for building interactive quizzes and tests, this book did not help me learn the program. I found the examples difficult to follow particularly in regards to the suggested modifications to the Action Manager tab. More than once, the step-by-step examples did not match the available options on my screen. The files on the CD-rom were also locked so I had to complete extra steps to copy and unlock them. On the plus side, the book does include a chapter that explains the key steps in the process of Instructional Design which is a useful process in building useful instructional materials."
2,Does not look like picture,"Besides the fact that it won't attach to my changing table (without drilling holes in it!) or my crib, it also looks cheap when you take it out of the packaging. This is the only gift from my shower I'm returning."
2,"Good plans for medieval furniture, lousy research!","The plans offer a good starting point for anyone interested in medieval furniture construction, but please don't take the accompanying background seriously, because it is full of inaccuracies and insubstantiated rumors. This said, if you are an enthusiast of medieval furniture, use the projects in this book as a starting point for your own exploration of medieval woodwork and to guide you in your research."
1,Not very useful to the beginning woodworker,"There are many problems with this book. The author uses the wrong terminology; he makes mistaken assumptions on the construction of the furniture; his woodworking methodology is very lacking; he dosen't appear to be a seasoned woodworker talking about making medieval furniture, but someone into medieval times writing about the furniture; 8 of the 19 projects are considered mideval on a technicality - beging made 50 or so years before the time frame ended; he says dovetails sould be cut with a hand held saber saw. I can picture people running to the local home center and buying 2x material and digging at it with dull chisels claiming it is medieval because it is crude. There are some good points. The tapestry and candle stand are inspiring, and the couple pages of resources at the back of the book. Anybody serious about medieval furniture should not consider this authoritative."
4,A good book for the price,"I picked this book up on a whim (at it's current low price it was easy to do that). I thought I might like to try my hand at medieval furniture construction in between scabbarding projects. After reading the book I've come to the conclusion that this volume at least doesn't have any projects that would fit in my house very well, but that's not the book's fault. So, although I doubt I'll be building any of the projects in here, nonetheless I'm glad I purchased the book. It's an interesting thing to read through and I did get some good ideas from it for some scabbarding projects."
5,Surely a winner!,"The proposed venture seemed irresistible. Obtain a former Atlantic luxury liner due for demolition and adapt it for gentle holiday cruising around the British Isles. Register the venture in France and run luxury gambling rooms on board. Several men become involved in launching this scheme which appears to prosper until one of them is murdered.Crofts displays all his considerable skills in creating all this, timetabling and detailing all aspects of this vast enterprize, providing mini travelogues along the way and contriving an almost fool-proof alibi.Having surveyed most of Freeman Wills Crofts' output in recent years, I would not argue with anyone who rated this his best book."
3,"Interesting, but dated","Bob's book covers more on his life story than the actual meat of playing video poker. I did enjoy reading it though.Vegas changes a lot, and this book has not kept up with that change.Overall, interesting, but if you want to learn how to play video poker, this book is not for you."
2,The real money is in book and video royalties,"Even though he won over $1 million in a five-month period, he had to put most of his winnings back into the machines in order to win the next big jackpot. Mathematically his strategies are probably perfect, but that doesn't put money into my pocket. I've played video poker using his strategies and I lose every time. I guess if I had a bankroll of $80,000 to spend I would eventually win a jackpot, but then what's the sense if I win a jackpot of $40,000 when I'm already down by $60,000??!!! The book is a nice story about his life while earning a living at video poker, but his real earnings these days are from the sale of books, strategy cards, and video poker CDs."
4,Spiritual Path,"Having been a fan of Michael Stearns music for a while I was intrigued to listen to ""Singing Stones""... Like most of his music its an actual experience that really connects with the universe and anyone who is following their spiritual paths....It has a way of awakening the senses.....and gives listeners an insight into the mysteries that native sacred sites hold...."
4,Serial Mama,"In the 1890's, 3 women were sentenced to death for murdering children that they had taken for money.Mama's Babies is based on these real-life 'baby farmers', and is seen from the point of view of a (fictional) teenaged girl who begins to realize her life isn't normal, as children continue to join her ""mama""s household and eventually disappear mysteriously."
4,Kid's Review,"""I hate Mimi! I hate her! Now that Mimi died, who's going to help me with my homework and have special tea with me?"" Claudia has just suffered a sad good bye. Then someone else popped into Claudia Kishi's life. Carrie Addison. Carrie is a small, quiet 9 year old girl who makes Claudia realize that as terrible as she felt about Mimi, she realized Claudia knew her love. Claudia was lucky. Then Claudia relized it would be harder to be Carrie Addison.I thought this book was great. I would read it 10 times over if I could. It was great becausse it has a few lessons for Claudia. I recommend this book for ages 8+."
1,Piece Of Junk,"This printer is a piece of junk! It just wastes the ink incredibly fast and ink is freakin expensive! It cant load paper at all, it always jams and then tries and prints anyway, then when you do get paper through it, there are big ink lines on the back from where it was draining out. The only half decent thing is the scanner, that works good when scanning something to the computer, thats about it."
2,DON'T BUY!,"This printer sucks up ink like no other and ink cartridges are expensive. I purchase new ones, even though the software says it's still full. Once I put the cartridges in, it will last for a few pages, then start streaking again. I tried to do the maintenance cleaning just in case the nozzles were clogged, but this didn't help either. As far as the scanner goes, it does a good job."
3,not nothing,"Yes, the universe was created 6000 years ago in 6 literal days as described by the One who was there, Jesus Christ in the first book of the bible. The Big Bang is a fairy tale with zero scientific backing. Also the universe was created from spiritual substance, not nothing. Get the book Refuting Compromise and Dismantling the Big Bang by John Hartnett."
3,Knights & Emeralds,"Great 80's movie, brought back tons of memories of the 80's. I really liked the main female lead Beverly Hills."
4,Right Head size,"This headset is really nice in terms of functionality. The fidelity is superb even in noisy environments. If your rear ""ear to ear"" distance exceeds 91/4"" you will not be able to use these. I am at the max and I have a relatively small head (hat 71/8"")."
2,big head?,"Nice product...easy to use, connected well with my blackjack! Good sound! Gave me a complex....would'nt fit around my head very well, and pulled on my ears. If you have an average size head then you might should pass on this one. If you have a tiny head then this is the product for you."
4,mcfarlane sportpicks NFL,"Don't believe the hype. Won a orange Ricky Williams, but received a green regular instead. Amazon needs to keep up with it's inventory"
4,Teach Me Tonight,"Nicole Henry's voice is perfect for the music she's chosen for a collection of the standards in the cd. I have all of her published music and always look forward to the next cd, which always impresses me.."
2,Not one of her best,"I like Mary Balogh, but I didn't like this book. It was very formulaic and the secondary characters were much more interesting than the main ones."
3,"Ok, But I like the other ones better.",This is an all-right set. Be warned it shows shapes ect. but does not tell the baby what they are (that's your job). I much preferred Little Steps: ABC's and Little Steps: Numbers & Shapes individual DVDs that my son had (and played out). In fact I just ordered another copy of the ABC's for my 17 month old. Unlike this dvd collection. the others actually tell the kids what each letter/ shape ect are so I can go do house cleaning and know she is getting the most out of video. Thanks to Little Steps: ABC's my son knew all his letters (could recognize and say them) before he was 2 years old. Decide which you have time to do before you buy this set.
1,Not the size the ad says,I put the jacket in my wish list becasue I fell in love with it. I did receive it for a gift from my brother. The jacket write up says it is a Giovanni Navarre Ladies Leather Jacket w/Belt -XXL (22-24). The jacket I received is probably a small. It is labeled a XXL but it fits my 8yr old. Wrong size completley. Sent an email to seller about returning it and no response. It will cost half of what it cost to return the item. This seller is crazy. DO NOT EVER BUY FROM THEM-THEY SUCK. Now I am stuck with a jacket that I cannot wear!!! Thanks alot for nothing. Mary H
3,jazz??,this is NOT Windmill Saxophone Quartet but a trio called Windmill female vocals a cello and contrabass.
4,The meek shall inherit the Earth!,"This will reverse your pre-conditioned beliefs about who is the bad guy and who is the good.Wearing my PC hat, this is an anti-ableist film. Instead of joining the millions of films that make the disabled look bad, this film has a mentally-challenged man as its hero. Disability rights advocates may want to spread the word on this film.Politics aside, this film is incredibly sexy. It has female and male nudity, back and front. It takes place in a taboo environment. I would love for US filmmakers to make films like this and be inspired by this Spanish example.I rented this film on a fluke and had a serendipitous experience!"
5,Holiday Switch,"This was a Christmas present for my Mom, she loves to watch Christmas movies. I haven't watched any of the movies that I've bought off Amazon yet, but she hasn't complained about the quality of them yet so all is good in the world!"
5,Holiday Switch,"Yes, I like this movie a lot. My daughter and I watch it together, and we both laugh, and have our favorite parts.It is something we look forward to sharing every holiday season! Thank you for a great movie!"
2,Not as good as my old pair,"I had another pair for about 6 years until the leather broke through on my thumb. So, I would say the old pair was pretty durable. I used them a lot as they fit well, too. Bought this new pair........and the fit is no longer good -- large is NOT large. They are very tight at the wrist, and the palm/fingers are too short....the leather is noticeably thinner and does not protect me from rose bush thorns......and the color sucks. My old pair was a nice blue.I would return them, except I've worn and used them now. Bottom line is, if you've had these before, you may be sorely disappointed in these new ones. The quality and fit have gone down hill."
4,A Pedal Car Enthusiast's Delight !,"302 page edition (volume # 4) featuring year 2,000 values. More than 600 individual large, sharp, full color pictures are shown. Includes over 100 pages of manufacturer catalog pages, advertisements, newspaper clippings, original postcards, and much more. Pedal Car fans will enjoy this work and find it an invauable reference."
3,Not for beginners,"It is a okay work out if you are already familiar with belly dancing. If belly dancing is new to you, I would not recommend this workout. She doesn't explain the moves very well and is hard to follow. I tried numerous times, hoping that I would eventually figure it out. But I never did and had better luck just doing yoga."
3,fun but complicated,"Gentle workout for the mother to be. It's great for stretching out a sore back. Not for the novice dancer. The moves are barely taught before they are put into a dance. I was lost most of the time, but it is a fun alternative to prenatal yoga and walks around the neighborhood."
3,NOT for beginners! But a good workout,"First off, this video is NOT for beginners. If this is your first try at belly dancing this is not a good or most importantly not a safe way to start. There are certain techniques and positions that you must keep in mind when belly dancing and this video does not cover them. These techniques provide proper balance as well as safety so that you don't hurt yourself. (ie soft knees, weight shifting, pelvic positioning)I've been dancing for a few years and now that I'm pregnant (and unfortunately in a location that does not offer group classes) I wanted something to do at home. It was a nice workout and got my heart pumping and blood flowing. I'm four months pregnant and took it really slow. This video is fast paced and doesn't break down moves. Belly dancing is about a mind/body connection so be sure to listen very closely to your body."
3,Easiest printer ever for photos; slurps ink,"This printer comes with the easiest-to-use photo organizing and printing software we've ever seen. This is the first setup that my wife is actually willing to use. That's no small statement since we bought our digital camera three years ago -- which takes excellent photos -- but it's always been too complicated before installing the Lexmark software, which is a snap.We printed about 100 borderless 4x6 photos before the ink ran out. Definitely we'll buy the high-capacity ink next time. With the high capacity ink I think it will come to something between 20-30 cents per photo.At high resolution, the printer is super-slow. That's okay for us. Overall, it's a great purchase, but time will tell if the cost of ownership is too high due to the ink consumption.Update 12/23/2006 (after 2 years): This thing is way too expensive to maintain; the ink costs more than double the competition -- even the ""generic"" ink is more expensive. Time to get a new printer."
5,THE book for Windows 2000 VPN,"I reviewed this book before it went to press and thought it was excellent. I received a copy of the finished book and have already used it on many occasions to help configure Windows 2000 VPNs. This book is not for those looking to learn about VPN technologies, but for those looking to implement VPN services on Windows 2000. It provides detailed step-by-step configuration instructions and I highly recommend it."
2,Mediocre,This is a mediocre book. I find the style of writing somewhat confused.Like the half dozen other books on networking and information security that I bought from New Riders over the past few years (this was definitely the last one) it makes you wonder if they employ editors at all.
3,JUST A MILD SCOLDING,"Agatha Christie with good dialogue and a smallish dose of contemporary reality (ie violence, sex, etc) is how I'd describe Minette Walters on the strength of the Scold's Bridle and my earlier reading of the Dark Room. Its suitably complex in its plotting (although not as labyrinthine as the Dark Room, fortunately) with the usual (large) range of suspects. Ms Walters is also a competent user of language. This is why my review isn't scalding. The reason I'm inclined to scold Ms Walters however is because I just couldn't feel empathy with any of the characters -they are too stereotyped and one dimensional. Some of their actions I found totally unbelievable -when the doctor and her husband suddenly fell in love (parentally)with Ruth I nearly choked on my own incredulity -I thought I must be reading Barbara Cartland"
5,Sometimes an author gets it just right.,"Are there some authors that you hear good things about so you add them to your to be read list, but somehow you never seem to get around to opening one of their books? That's the way it was with Minette Walters and me until I finally took the plunge and read ""The Scold's Bridle."" Let me assure you that it won't be long until I read everything else she has written. This is a first rate novel and a top notch mystery full of surprises, wisdom and especially some very smart dialogue. Thank you Ms. Walters. Now who else is waiting in that ""to be read one of these days"" pile"
2,I read this because of the reviews and was disappointed.,"Reading is such a personal thing. We can't all like the same thing. Allowing for that this book looked like it had a good story line and I had never read a judith french book before so I gave it a try. Well, the story/plot definitely was good but I didn't care for the disjointed writing style of this author. And there were too many inconsistencies. Sorry folks. I wouldn't bother with this one."
1,not Hoover not even compatible just doesn't fit buy else where,It's NOT Hoover it's no name crap that doesn't fit in my Hoover Fold Away Turbo 3100This is the second time I ordered filters. I'm very annoyed
2,Not too helpful for Windows users,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a Mac guru to help with learning to use a recently purchased iBook. I am a longtime and skilled PC user.I can see where this book would be helpful to someone who was familiar with previous Mac OSes, but it did not spell things clearly enough for this poor Windows user. The book even recommends buying ""Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual"" instead of this book for Windows users.The portions of the book that I have managed to wade through have been somewhat confusing due to typos, unclear labeling, and mislabeling, i.e. referring to a $ as a pound sign.I generally consider O'Reilly books an excellent source to learn from, but this book was a disappointment."
4,Aircraft Accident Analysis,A very interesting book providing a wealth of information on some well known aircraft accidents. I was especially interested in the commercial jet aircraft accident reports.
5,Wonderful stories for 4-year-old,"Our 4-year-old daughter absolutely adores these stories. She asks to hear them almost every night. Each short tale teaches valuable lessons with a dry sense of humor that we both appreciate. I have gifted these and every recipient loves them just as well. Don't hesitate to buy, especially at such a reasonable price."
1,"beautiful voice, horrible material - avoid","Like Athena bursting out of the forehead of Zeus, Ella Fitzgerald seemingly came onto the music scene fully armed with one of the most beautiful voices in the history of jazz. Unfortunately, the fates conspired against her, and cursed her with some of the most insipid material imaginable on these recordings. (The liner notes themselves admit that the executives at Decca had no idea what to do with the talented young woman.)Save your money and buy the ""Best of Decca"" for the classics such as ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"", and spare yourself the torture of the terrible lows."
3,gloves are fine,"The service time was excellent. Gloves are fine.Didn't like the colors as much as in the add, butpictures cannot represent perfectly the color of an item."
1,did not work,"I bought this item to keep my son from sucking on his fingers. It did not affect him, in fact he kept wanting to put it on. Lol."
1,A misleading title and a mediocre book,"I thought this book was going to be a thorough study on Heidegger's concept of the "" They "" - as the title of the book implies. The reality however is that the book is the worst kind of intellectual hodgepodge mixing different ideas (Sartre, obscure intellectuals) while only occasionally touching on Heidegger. I was sorely disappointed."
2,"Basics, bad hosts, and little else...","Chris Moneymaker is quick to tell you two things. First, that is his real name. Second, that he is a world champion poker player. After that, this DVD is devoid of much information. Yes, they explain a couple of games in a ""how to play"" format. But as far as tips to make you a better player, or better yet a winner, not so much.(...)It's kind of like you gambled and lost."
2,dont waste your money,"this video is like 20 minutes long and just cover like the very basic of poker. so if you know nothing about poker at all you might want this video but beleive me you shoud just save you money for ice cream and join a poker site. it free and you can learn what this video is saying in 10 minutes. their are a number of poker sites that u can play on and u can play for free until you learn the game to your satifaction then you can buy chips and play for real money, some good sites are ultimate bets and poker stars. so dont waste your money or time getting this dvd."
2,"Wish You Hadn't Told, George","Being a huge George Jones fan, I felt as though his music was the one constant in his life that enabled him to ""go on"" after whatever disappointments life dealt; sing about the pain and let it go, sort of deal. After reading this book (and I really wish I hadn't) I am left more with the impression that his music was just a means to fund his habits and addictions. I'm not sure what I expected, but this book wasn't it. The book's focus seems to be repetitive through and through on being ""high"" or ""drunk"" and stupid things George did while under the influence. No big love story on the George and Tammy thing. He even divulges that he has, in fact, physically abused his current wife, Nancy. I'm going to forget(or try to) that I ever read this as I listen to all my GJ music and remember what I was doing when the song(s) came out, and NOT what George says he was doing when he recorded it/them."
2,"Buy The CD, Skip The Book","I have come to really hate celebrity autobiographies. Their writers are full of excuses and rationalizations for their often erratic and sometimes unconscionable behavior. These books are usually only a gimmick - ancillary promotion for the performer's latest CD or movie. And for those such as Mr. Jones, whose music has made him one of the immortals, they are particularly useless. Mr. Jones' CD of the same title is a much wiser investment of time and money than this book."
4,great towels at great price,"I had purchased similar microfiber towels at Costco a few years ago and they were great. I tried looking for them online and found these here on Amazon. These things are awesome for anything. I clean my car, dust my tv, dust furniture, heck even clean my paintball guns. They are extremely water absorbent and tough. When they get too dirty, just scrub them off with soap and water and they're ready to go again.The only reason I went with 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are a bit thin. My previous Costco ones were a tad thicker and thus a little more absorbent."
2,Not great,"Got them, they work, just sorry they are from China. Guess I will have to stop shopping on line so I can see where stuff is made. Tires from China were recalled today."
4,Cover For Your Bundt Cake,This lid is a nice compliment to the Nordic Ware Bundt pan. It is not flimsy & I like the locking lid feature. It looks nice to take to someones house. Good value for the price. Doesn't easily scratch up.
1,Too Fragile,The first one I got was broken in the box. The second one I got broke (shattered really) the first time the lid was dropped. UGH! I love this. Walmart has a 'tupperware' style one that is fantastic. Now that this one is broken I wished I bought two.
5,Best I Have found for the Purpose,"This is ideal for the price. I have read many reviews. My only advice: return if defective, but don't turn it down for minor issues."
5,Kepps food fresh,"This is a great product, just what i wa slooking for, easy to clean and handle and keeps bread and cake fresh longer at room temperature."
3,Could be sturdier,The cake keeper did not meet my expectations. I ordered 2 and had to return one as it was broken. It is much more delicate that I had expected from Nordic Ware. It serves the purpose but can see where it would crack very easily if not handled very carefully.
5,The Ultimate,"This album is simply unbelievable! My wife and I cant stop listening to it. My neighbors come over and listen, awe-struck by its beauty. I know it sounds crazy but this album is something else. If you dont buy it you are missing an emotional experience. I have been an avid stereophile for over forty five years and own many recordings but I cherish this one the most of all. Buy it before you cant!"
1,ABC Colon Cleanse - 12oz - Powder ABC Colon Cleanse - 12oz - Powder,"I remember this product working very well when i was younger , and it worked great. I was on the dr natura product for a sometime and was always amazed on how i felt . But since that product is a little more i decided to try ABC again after losing my job to save a few dollars. Anyways 2 months in i have constant gas and bloating and the taste is not the same that i remember . Long story short ill spend the extra 20.00 dollars and go back to dr natura colonix program. FYI you must call the company if you only want the fiber and not the whole pricey package"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I am on day 3 of this and I must say I was expecting a lot more. The taste of this alone is awful. I have only had one bowel movement since I started 3 days ago. I am extremely bloated and gassy, which was what I was hoping to get rid of by doing the cleanse. I have drank about 8 bottles of water a day, ate lots of veggies and fruit, hoping to pass a BM, and nothing. I'll keep at it for a few more days but so far I am disappointed."
1,Disappointment,The author attempts to lead inexperienced coaches down a path of genious only to complicate the subject. The triangle thing is not a good method.
1,Very Dissatisfied!,"I've had a problem with one of the DVD players. I notified Electronics Expo twice and you once. To date nothing has been done to resolve the problem. I'm very unhappy as it was a Christmas gift, ordered and paid for well in advance. After this experience I will be reluctant to purchase anything of this expense from Amazon again."
1,Not really fond of this this type of story. I did not realize it was all together different then the other Hannah Bowel books.,"I was not thrilled with this book. I have read many Hanna Howell books that I enjoyed ,but not this one.I o.k."
3,Got Me Hooked,I really enjoyed this one. The premise behind it was well thought out. I look forward to her finishing this series.
4,Old time boogie,"This compilation appears to start out in chrono order. Disk 4 is more big band style. Some songs are duplicates of others on the set. Some covers of more famous versions but mostly original. Very low background noise. This set lets you hear how it started out and influenced the later artists that we have now in blues/rockabilly and other genres of music. The production isn't as good as today, but it's still worth the cost to hear what the early pioneers did with the tunes."
5,Cummings MS Reading class,"I think that this book is really important because you can learn many things like whats dengerous.For example when Tony and Joel went to the Vermilion River and one of them got drown. You donnt need to listen to your friends all the time, especilly if they are wrong."
4,The Graet On MY Honor,"My name is Kyla Iversen and in 8 grade. I read a book called ""One My Honor"" and it's about two boys who are friends, they go on a bike ride to Starve Rock Park. On their way, one boy stops and wanted to go swimming. But something happens at the river. It's a good book and one that you can't put down. It has a very good ending and an easy book to read. The book makes you just want to never stop reading and when you get to the end it makes you want to read it over and over again."
5,A great book that will catch you by the heart.,"This story kept me on the edge of my seat and I could not put it down until I finished it. Marion Bauer does a wonderful job at pulling the reader into the story and leaving them spellbound. This is a great book for boys or girls to read alone or to use as a read aloud in the classroom. If it kept me spellbound at the age of 23, imagine what it could do to a classroom of 4th or 5th graders! They won't want you to put it down until they find out what happens. This would be a great book to use for open discussion in the classroom."
4,fifth grade litature group,"Why is the book called On My Honor? "" On you honor Joel. You won't go any where but the park?"" "" On my honor.On my honor is about two boys who break a promise, and one of the boys drown when they go to the river instead of the park.Joel dared Tony to swim to the sand bar. That's why Tony died.After Joel couldn't find Tony he despratly needed help. He ran out in front of a car and asked for help.But there wasn't any luck.Joel went home and locked himself inside of the house.His father came home and wonderd where Tony was but Joel lied. Tony's mother and father were very worried.Can you imagine what the rest of the story is about?If not this is a good book to read."
3,Not very good :-(,"Made in China! It works though. I have a 360 in a 81 CJ7 with a Howell Injection System. Test your old one by looking on UTUBE for instruction how to test it. This and a new O2 Sensor helped my fuel problem as the ECM was sending info to the TB Injectors to push more fuel out. Now the fuel pressure guage shows the right amount of fuel pressure. Make sure you disconnect your ground when changing out any sensor to reset the computer (ECM) !!!!Cheap China Junk! 2-8-13. 2000 miles and 10 months later, I tested this junk with my multimeter the 3 various ways and it doesn;t hold up to the vaccuum test. I'm now giving it a 3 stars due to its availability but the MAP & O2 sensor is the life-blood for the ECM to get the air/fuel mixtured ratios right and this China junk has made me mad. Problem is you can't find USA made parts. I'd gladly spend more money on better quality."
5,SUPERB SWING JAZZ,"This is one of my favourite jazz CDs and returns to my HiFi on a regular basis. Great recording, outstanding musicianship and swing music. A joy from start to finish. Enjoy"
2,way too lightweight,"I had high hopes for this book & was totally disappointed. The best (only) line in the book was in the excerpts. Instead of specific help, I found only candy sweet aphorisms."
2,"sweet, but not much useful information","I purchased this book because I am planning on adopting a child as a single parent. I had hoped to find some useful information on parenthood, but this book was more just vague optimism and humor from a divorced parent. It is a positive and sweet look at being a single parent, just not very informative."
5,Perfect Pick Me Up!,"This book not only made me feel that in an imperfect world I can do the job that God intended me to do but it also made me realize that there are women out there that are dealing with the same problems as I am. I felt that Patrice really knows from experience what I am embarking on as a single mother. I know that some of the worlds greatest teachers learn from experience and to me what better teacher can you have than her......Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! This book made me laugh out loud, and that was something I so desperately needed. Small enough to carry in my purse so that way if I need reassurance I just pull it out and begin reading what she as well as what I wrote in the self help pages! If you have an hour or so read the book you will be glad you did!"
1,"If I could give it 0 stars, I would","This book was a total waste of money. I bought this for myself, and despised it. I read it once, in disbelief that anything so bad could be published, put it on the shelf and never looked at it again until it was time for a garage sale.Don't make the same I did and actually purchase this."
5,Great TV,"I buy most of my items based on Consumer Reports recomendation and this is the Highest rated TV by them. The price was very good and delivery by Amazon.com (electronics Expo) was prompt.The picture quality, as Consumer Reports review said, is outstanding for HD, SD broadcast and for DVD playback. In fact, picture quality is far superior than the LCD HDTV, Plasma HDTV and Samsung DLP HDTV that I have seen. Sports in HD from local CBS channel shows simply stunning! I have paired it with Sony upconverting DVD Player (excellent performatce), Terk indoor HDDTa antenna (great reception of local ATSC, HDTV channels) and Direct TV and so far I am very happy with this purchase."
3,"Great color, but thin, and bubblegum scented!","So these are the perfect bright pink color if that's what you're in the market for. Not fuschia, almost hot pink. They are the thinnest sheets I have ever purchased - light passes throught them. I am not loving the quality, but they will work for my daughter's bed for now while I hunt for better quality. To my surprise, they are bubblegum scented. Yes, scented. Why anyone would feel the need to add a nasty ridiculous chemical smell is beyond me. Two washes and they still smell. I wish I had known that, I would have never bought them. And I purchased three sets. All three smell like bubblegum."
4,So far so good,Bought it to replace Belkin hub that went wonky. Liked this one cause it gave me more ports. Doesn't seem to run as hot as the Belkin (Good I hope). Fired up fine and works fine.
4,cables,Merchandise came on time and was highly effective for my needs. Easy installation and pwer adaptor allows anything to be used w/o hesitation.
3,Product Description Incomplete,"I've purchased Modiano playing cards several times in the past from different vendors. I assumed that all designs of these spectacular cards came in a case befitting their durability. However, the cards i received had a less than satisfactory case to store them in. There was no mention of a case in the description and I accept full responsibility for making an assumption. However, i will not purchase from this vendor, or any other vendor for that matter, until the details of the case are specified."
4,The ONLY way to make it through a night at Copy Club.,"I didn't expect much from this book, but it has found itsway into my collection of favorites. The protagonist's angstregarding his love interest and his career were tempered by the author's wry sense of humor. I thoroughly enjoyed every page, and am on my way to the bookstore right now to pick up Welter's next two novels. END"
4,"Great way to begin, for kids or musically challenged adults",A really easy introduction to playing songs that sound good right from the start. Painless way to learn to read music. The accompanying CD works well with separable recorder and accompaniment.
3,easy to follow but should include scales for practice,This book is good for getting use to a few notes. I was hoping to see scales in this book which is very important if a player wants to develop more as far as theory is concerned. I also noticed that the music stayed mostly in the key of C. This could be a problem since a lot of Celtic recorder music uses other key signatures like G. This booklet does include a fingering chart for all the notes you will probably not use in the included songs but will use later on with other music.
1,Full of Holes,"Swiss cheese of a story with cliched characters and pitiful writing. Most stories get a little better as they go along, this one just got worse and worse. It was hard enough to accept the lead character Philip Mercer, geologist/ international superspy and all around hero. But the story and its characters werefull of convenient holes. With 400-plus pages you'd think theauthor could have spackled some of them. If DuBrul is really among the best in adventure writers, I think I'll give up on the genre."
3,Oh Please!,"Lots of fun, at first, but eventually I just couldn't handle all the conveniently placed holes that let Mercer escape out of yet another impossible situation. I finished it but hated the last 100 pages or so because it all became so unbelievable. I've also read some Cussler but Mercer puts Pitt to shame.I mean, really, a left-over submarine.....Reminded me of the old cliff-hangers where you actually saw the hero die in the last 5 seconds ... but, no, in the next episode he magically survives.Not for the serious reader."
4,Loved it,Philip Mercer has shown nice character development from past books. Jack duBrul gets better with each new book with more fluid writing and more realistic characters.
2,Simply Awful,"I like twin labs so I decided to try this instead of the liquid vitamin that I normally use. Huge mistake. It's not that the other B complex didn't have a strong flavor, but this one is just horrible. The other liquid B went into my breakfast smoothie and disappeared flavor wise. One teaspoon of this stuff mixed into 24 oz of protein and fruit and other vitamins dominated in flavor and ruined the whole thing. Given how fantastic I felt with the other liquid complex, this one is not worth it on any level."
2,Nice but not authentic Muwashahat,"The authentic muwashshah is a combination of a great poem and melodic music supposed to bring the audience to the state of ""Tarab"". ""Tarab"" can not be explained by one English word and it is often described as the state of spiritual ecstasy where one departs from any surrounding sound or distraction and gets carried away by the music into a level of enjoyment unknown before.These musical compositions by the excellent Morkos ensemble are parts of muwashah and never a complete muwashshah that carries one to a state of ""Tarab"". Most compositions are shorter than three minutes and you barely get into the rethym before you move on into the next song in hasty manner. If you just want to know what a muwashshah is go ahead and buy the CD, but if you are a muwashshah fan this CD will leave you frustrated as a wasted opportunity."
4,Great Product,"The Akro-Mils Storage Bins made it so much easier for me to organize my garage. They were a lot sturdier than I expected. I had some other bins that cracked too easily; I expected these to do the same, but they didn't. The only objection i had to this product is that they didn't have lids; however, the fact that they are stackable more than makes up for this. I strongly suggest purchasing this product if you have a pile of random nails and bolts that need organizing."
1,Vista 64,I am really hoping this will play on a Vista 64 as I already bought it and waiting for it to arrive.
3,A moment of time in Irish-American history.,"True, the recording quality is poor. Yes, his reedy voice makes me wince. But considered within the proper context, this album is a landmark.After listening to Frank Quinn for a spell, I even stopped wincing. I was caught up instead in a moment of time, when he and his Irish friends recaptured a bit of home through his music."
5,Lester And Buck in '44,"Lester Young's sax is like slick ice and Buck Clayton's trumpet is pure fire. Writers often cr- iticize Lester's postwar playing and now you can hear it and contrast it with the 1939 sides which feature the under appreciated rhythm section of Fred Green, Jo Jones and Walter Page. This is high-grade stuff, my brothers and sisters from two musical masters."
5,Warn 36655 Rear Full Floater Hub Lock Set,I ordered this as a repair to my original Hub conversion installed in 1999. I ordered PN 36655 and received the new updated conversion hubs. They now have an internal sleeve that slides into the spring to keep the spring centered within the hub. The manual dial now has a setWarn 36655 Rear Full Floater Hub Lock Setscrew to keep it secure in the lock or unlock position.
2,Nothing of much value,"This book is a compilation of generaly available information and boatloads of case law.My problem is that most people that buy airplanes likely know the difference between a LLC and a Corp. This book offers no new information in that regard. The case histories are likely of little use unless you are an attorney yourself.Most disappointing is that it offers no direction into why one might want to use an LLC vs. corp, it simply tells you what they both are. I was looking for some examples that might apply to my own situation with advice on what course might be most beneficial to me.Instead, I found that the book gave lots of information (most of which I already know) but no opinion or advice on what to do with any of it ...This might be more considered a reference and is not very educational."
5,Great for kids and parents alike,"Julie has combined catchy tunes with intelligent lyrics -- a potent (and rare) combination in the children's-music kingdom. The songs are timeless, yet fun -- they keep my toddler, baby and age 30+ husband (and me) rocking at the same time. Now THAT'S what I call good music."
5,Excellent product,We have used this product for 3 years with excellent results. It was recommended by our doctorThe idea that a user must write a small composition to rate a product will defer me from any positive reviews ink the future
4,CosaminDS 108 count Capsules.,"I must admit that I am still skeptical about taking these type of joint relief pain relief capsules. My knees aren't hurting as much as theyve had but is it the exercise that I've increased or the weight that ive lost? See I'm skeptical. Not willing to test Karma, I purchase these capsules every time I'm out because I'm not willing to test Karma."
4,It does seem to help all of my aches and pains,"I have had multiple spine surgeries, shoulder and wrists surgically worked on. I have auto immune issues. I used to take prescription Meloxicam anti inflammatory meds every day for past five years to help with pain. I had to stop due to stomach issues. I tried this Cosamin DS and after the initial two weeks of taking 3 or 4 pills daily I am down to 2 pills daily and it does seem to help with the pain in my joints. Its not completely gone, but anything that helps me get thru the day without taking meds that are hard on my stomach is a godsend. I would say try it --- if it works its worth the money spent!"
4,ONE STAR - Updated Review & How to remove the stand / pedestal for wall mounting,"Ok, I just purchased this TV and have spent the past hour and a half trying to remove the stand/pedestal. I searched the web to no avail until I saw a review posted on Amazon. So to help all those people with the same issue - you simply remove the 5 screws on the back of the tv closest to the pedestal (there are 6 parallel screws - don't remove the top middle screw - hope this makes sense.) The stand is connected to a metal plate that will slide out of the base of the TV and voila!More later....once I get the TV hung and turned on!!!"
3,comprehensive for beginners,"""Comprehensive Owner's Guide"" is a bit misleading. I was raised with dogs, I know dogs and I know the breed my parents had all of my life. I don't really know Cardigan Corgis. This book didn't give me a lot that I needed. It would be wonderful for that person who wants to get a dog that has never, or only in childhood, owned a dog. Most information was about geting, raising and training a puppy. It doesn't mention anything about adopting an adult dog from the rescue (as I am planning on), it doesnt talk about introducing adult dogs to other dogs in the family (for instance; my parents three dogs) or introducing it to your curent pets (for instance; my cat). But it does go on, at length, about finding responcible breeders and care and training of puppies. All usefull information, but not what I was looking for. (If you want what I needed, try Cesar Millan's A Member of the Family, I found more applicable info there, for my situation.)"
3,For The Strong At Heart,"The movie was an interesting watch. I was thrilled to see an original, strong, inspiring, thought provoking movie, which connected with me immensely.There are many positives about this movie which far outweighs negatives if any. The movie has got strong characters. The hero is a hero in true sense: He has character (going to the girl's college and bringing her home as his life partner without wasting any time), fearlessness (choosing revenge as his personal duty), belief (declaring and deciding to kill enemies one by one instead of all at once) to name a few.For those who opine that the movie is too violent: After watching the movie, I've done my research on the central characters in real life. The reality it seems was no less violent than what is shown in the movie. The movie is a masterpiece. But I won't be too pleased if other movie makes imitate to make such movies lest it can have a negative influence on the immature. A must watch if you are a strong man at heart."
5,Excellent resource for creating professional presentations,This is an excellent book for anyone in the field of fashion or textile design who needs to make presentations to clients. Plenty of information on how to organize your thought processes as well as give your presentations impact. I would most certainly recommend this book to someone just starting out in the fashion industry. Even seasoned professionals could gain some new information on becoming more creative in their presentation of their product lines.
5,I bought this in perfect condition,"Perfect condition for very cheap, shipping cost more than the book did. Perfect condition, no bends, no writing, unbelievable. I hope I find the rest of my books this easily."
4,"Excellent recognition guide, with photos and all","this guide follows the jane tradition in recognition booklets. good information, tells all the specs about the weapons. packed full of sub guns, machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and virtually all small arms."
1,Not A Janes I Hope... Nooooo!,I got the first edition and was very disapointed. Didnt even come close to what would expected from a Janes Book.
3,THIS BOOK WAS O.K.,This book was quite interesting but in the middle of the book it was quite boring because they talked about her life style for too long so they were dragging it a bit but that's the only thing I did'nt like. R.L. Stine wrote better books than this.
1,A bad ending,"I thought that this book was really interesting in the beginning and middle but I thought that it has the worst ending. I felt that the ending to this was not the best and it was really stupid. Other than the ending, it thought that this was a good book."
5,Bad Dreams.. Online Review,"Bad Dreams was such a great book! Ilove reading R.L Stine's books. I am doing an online review for my teacher Miss O. I rate this Five stars!! Its about a girl name Maggie Travers who has horrable murder dreams. Im not going to tell u what happens, but sweet dreams!!"
2,Too Much Void,"Whatever happened to Roach's music since his magnificently haunting opus magnum, 'Dreamtime Return'? It's a puzzling question. Unfortunately, this one's nearly a monotone, and I cannot recommend it. There seems little rhythmic variation. Roach is a brilliant artist; let's hope he gets his edge back."
5,Deep and eternal,"Like an earlier reviewer, I also bought Roach's Void at the same time as Lustmord and Rich's Stalker. I agree with the previous reviewer that Stalker is unbelievably moving, but unlike him I resonated very strongly with Magnificent Void. It is rich with subtlety and fullness--as if the universe were belching forth from the void in super-slow-mo. Not as image-inducing as Stalker was, it is rather a deep unfolding of the mystery in its own time. I can understand where the detractors might come from based on its slow progression, but it really works for me."
2,Without pace or spark,"First, a confession: I started skimming around page 30 and gave up altogether around page 70.The book addresses a fascinating subject, but the writing is maddeningly repetitive. It is almost without the shaping and telling detail that makes history meaningful.Productive reflection on what is important and why is almost absent.If I had counted how many times the author asserts that no one has ever treated the topic adequately before, you would not believe the number.In summary, I'm prepared to believe there is useful information hidden in there somewhere; I'm just not prepared to waste any more time trying to find it.(I have given it two stars (rather than one) because a historian might find the references useful.)"
2,Flaky DVD player,"Got this at Christmas 2003. After about 4-5 months the audio on the DVD player worked only intermittently. That problem seemed to spontaneously correct itself, but now the DVD freezes up completely after about 1.25 hrs. of play. The remote doesn't have a mute button. The sound from the speakers is good, but the problems with the DVD player are unacceptable."
2,Waste of money,"Whatever happened to specifying the audience for a book. I really do not know how to categorize this book. The content of the book was definitely written for the CEO types, then why would a CEO need a CBT (Supplied on a CD ROM). A very weak index for the book makes it even hard to use. I did like one aspect of the book. Towards the end, about sixty five pages have been dedicated to a usable cross reference of Developer 2000 properties.I like the books with 400 pages or less, but this one falls short of its promise. I put very little to no value on the accompanied media, because if I wanted a CD media, I would have bought one. Spending $... for a cross reference of bunch of properties, is too steep in my opinion."
3,Jake & Never Land Pirates: Jake Saves Bucky,"At first the movie played great, after 3 weeks it now skips, had to purchase another copy in the store"
4,ZZ Top Live From Texas blu-ray,"I found the picture to be very crisp & clear however the vocals were somewhat muddy. My system is professionally calibrated & I have yet to experience this problem on any of my other B-D disks, live concert or movie alike. This was somewhat of a disappointment. Other than this disk delivers the goods."
4,Essentiak Top,I've been a ZZ Top fan for a lot of years so this is a compilation of both p;d a new music I'm happy to own.
2,The boys have seen better days...,"Excellent song selections for the DVD, but the music itself has none of the energy and excitement that ZZ Top used to bring to bear. The boys are old and they even move like they need something for their arthritis."
2,I love ZZ Top.........,"unfortunately, I do not love the sound mix on this. I would really like to hear this concert without the flatline audio. I was relieved to see others having the same trouble with this dvd...I thought it was me being overly critical, or my own equiptment's shortcomings. I found it almost impossable to watch. I was so excited to get this disc too!"
2,Not worth it,Love ZZ Top but there were too many camera angles in too short of time. Not to mention the audio quality was so poor it didn't sound as good as the CDs on surround sound. The guitars sound okay but awful (repeat) awful vocals. So dissapointed.
2,Live In Texas - Via Cell phone camera?,I agree with those who say the vocals are muffled. I wished it sounded a bit better. It would also of been nice if more songs were included. LaGrange was long & drawn out and toward the last 2-3 minutes it didn't even sound like LaGrange.I dislke the dead spots where they stop singing and let the audience sing. You couldn't even hear them.Now that they are all 60 years old I wonder how much longer they'll continue.And what's up with that lettuce bowl hat Billy has been wearing lately?
3,Where are the cassette tapes?,"This book is very good, but I agree that without the tapes it leaves out the most important part of learning legal transcription. Where are the cassette tapes? How can I get them? For the price of the book, these tapes should be included with the book."
5,Like walking in a pine forest,"Anything from ""Smell of the Tree"" is a good product and it really does smell like a pine forest."
5,What a hammock should be,"I'm not an expert on hammocks but I am very pleased with this product. Once you get the hang of it, it's extremely easy to use and supremely comfortable. It's a great place to spend a few hours with a book and a beer on a hot summer afternoon. And the bright colors look great. I'm 5' 11"" and weigh about 195 pounds and this hammock can hold me without any problem. Note that you will need to purchase tree straps and karabiners or some other device to fasten this to your favorite uprights. All in all, a very satisfying purchase."
4,fantastic,i bought this cd by chance in a little shop i dropped into when i visited memphis about 2 years ago. i have since given it as a gift to about 3 people and they have all loved it. sublime stuff.
2,disappointed,"after reading the reviews I expected a quality slipper when i ordered these but in a very short time my little toe was walking on the outside of the slipper, This was very disappointing since this is more than I usually spendon slipp ers."
4,"nice slippers, kind of narrow","these are nice slippers, the stitching looks good and the soles are fairly heavy although I think they should have a little more tread. These run small, I got a size bigger than I wear and they fit but they are narrow at the toe but I think they should stretch since they are leather."
3,Great slipper but doesn't fit,"It was disappointing to have to return these quality slippers but they were tight in the toe box and loose in the heel, not a fit for me."
1,Not soft & comfy,"I received these slippers as a gift for Christmas. They are not the ones I wanted but they looked soft and warm & durable so I started wearing them. I'm sure they will last a long time but they are not as warm as they looked, Their soles are too hard so it's hard to walk quietly when I'm the first one up and they don't have enough cushioning so they feel like a pair of shoes not like my old plush falling apart slippers. To boot, if you wear them without socks the label pokes the bottom of your feet. I'm unhappy that I'll be stuck with these for a few years."
1,Stopped working after 2 days,"Windows 2000 server. I then tried it on my Windows XP SP2 PC and it failed. The board is able to display the boot screen but dies as soon as the video driver supplied by the manufacturer is loaded.With a second video card installed, I could not see any resource conflicts in either the Windows 2000 or the XP PCs.By the way the product shipped was not a GeForce 6600 but a 6200."
5,"Visible, functional, affordable","Love this vest! My very active border collie wears one of these every time she leaves the house. When we walk I can see her for quite a ways in our woods and if she strays into the street, she is visible. If she gets rolling into some nasty stuff,the vest is chucked for a new one and most of the nasty stays off the dog...GREAT PRODUCT !"
2,Old version,"If you're going to buy this, get the new version (there are 5 now). The old versions are too out of date to be useful. However, the new versions are fantastic, highly recommended!"
5,Great Hairdo!!!!,"Great Story!! This story is so funny and real I cannot think of a better way to teach about respect and caring! This story has great animations, and the characters come alive from the creative writing! Definitly a high recommendation!!!!!!!!!"
4,Gets you inside the mind of one who lives to climb mountains,"Having read Into Thin Air, Eiger Dreams, and seeing the movie Everest, I have been vicariously experiencing the adventures of these men and women who feel compelled to climb. Addicted to Danger by Jim Wickwire helped to answer some of the questions about the mindset of these individuals. Chapter one about his account on Mt. McKinley and his friend's death captured my attention early. The triumphs and tragedies were spellbinding. I would like to have known more about the effects his long absences had on his wife and children. I don't think most spouses would be so understanding, but that is another story. Overall, thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Big bummer,"This is the guy who saved the expedition on his return to K2, who in fact allegedly got Jim Whitaker to go back. Simply a most fascinating guy who sits down with ghostwriter and puts it down full of arrogance and detachment, devoid of all humor, wit, or any sense of passion or personality. So bad, I couldn't finish it, and I worshipped this guy a little after reading ""The Last Step"" by Ridgeway. Wickwire is an amazingly interesting guy, but seems to try very successfully not to be one in the book. Especially interesting if you lived in Seattle (I think) in the 70s and 80s. I just wish he made his interesting life into a halfway decent book."
3,"Resonable Action, and Annoying Egos","While the action kept me reading on, the depth of the characters was lacking. Sometimes I wasn't sure if I was reading an adventure book, or a self-help guide. I can appreciate his attempt to develop the inner conflict between what he really wanted, and his sideline attempt to be a family man. However, I found it hard to sympathize much with Jim Wickwire. I finished the book thinking that the author had carried out his egotistical nature into a book to share with the world. I did not finish the book with a feeling of admiration for the sport or the climber, but with more of a disappointment. These caliber of climbers seem to be a rather dysfunctional and egotistical bunch. In that sense, I think the author failed to make his point. In a good sense, I think the author has taken a hard and perhaps humbling look at what is really important in life."
4,Excellent autobiography on one's desire to climb,"Wickwire tells a powerful story from his college ""bouldering"" days to his attepmts on Everest. I have heard stories before about the famous bivouac on K2, but to hear him tell you himself is simply amazing! An extraordinary tell of a man who was driven by that unknown ""sixth sense"" that all climbers have and get tired of explaining it to those those who ask ""why climb"" -because if we have to explain it, you'll never get it."
1,radio shack version not so good either,"I bought the Radio Shack version of this phone (same phone, different labels) and it is has a horrible popping noise every second or two. The speakerphone part works okay."
1,For managers only.,"This book is useful only to complete newcomers to data warehousing, particularly managers, although I consider Rob Mattison's or Vidette Poe's books to be better for the latter group. There is little substantive for the hands-on practitioner who has to build a real data warehouse. In fact, this book has very little to say about data warehouses at all - most of the book is generic project management stuff. If you need hard-core information about the design of a real data warehouse, try Ralph Kimball's or Erik Thomsen's books"
2,Daphne- not of the brilliant blue,"This movie is just a waste of money and the story is so juvenile that it might as well be rated NC-17 for how much skin can we show and not be rated XXX. Don't waste your money, especially if you have young children at home."
3,"Good vintage tracks, but duplicates another release","This CD includes sessions recorded in 1954 by two prominent trombone artists (four tracks each). Originally released separately in 10-inch LP format, they were later combined for release on a 12-inch LP under the title ""Slidin' Swing."" It's good material for anyone interested in jazz of that era, and the packaging is excellent, with reproductions of the album art and original liner notes (in a readable format) as well as new liner notes for this release.For a collector of vintage Urbie Green tracks, this CD appears to be a must-have, displaying the skills that earned Urbie the top spot on Down Beat magazine's New Star poll that same year. But if Urbie is what you're after, pass this one up and buy ""Blues and Other Shades of Green,"" a recent release of material from the same era that includes 16 tracks of Urbie, including all four of the tracks on ""Slidin' Swing."" (See my review of that CD.)"
2,IF you can stand the vocals,"If you can stand Chris Botendahl vocals, then Grave Digger is really a great band. But this album is not so good, speaking from a musical point of view."
3,The leader and the plague!!,"Grave Digger is a great band and this album is in accord with their great tradition. The tragedy is that their leader, Chris, also ha one of the worst metal voices ever recorded over the face of Earth, and this without doubts makes them lose some potential fans."
4,Useful,This is one book on International business that is less about equations and more abput understanding the socio-eonomic dynamics involved in International business. Definitely worth the price.
5,Love this shampoo!,"I have thick coarse hair that is colored, and this shampoo is the best. It smells really good too! It is my absolute favorite!"
2,Hair breakage,The product is to prevent hair breakage .This reminds me of pump it up .And pump it up maintain the style but you lose hair.Pump it up is 1..99 not 14.99
2,Only God has the answers- not this author,"People want an easy explanation of how life originated, who is the creator and where do we go when we die. People who choose to believe there is no penalties in the afterlife for the bad things we've done or who think a certain author (man) has all the answers (without any proof), will love this book. Those who want to know the real answers to these questions from the author of life and the universe itself, owe it to themselves to pick up a copy of a better book on the subject. It's called The King James Bible and has been around since around 60 A.D. It's the inspired word of God as handed down to man. It's the most popular book on the planet and has stood the test of time and will remain so for generations after we've passed on. Why not dust off your copy and read it today?""For my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge"""
4,A little too long,I saw this valance and knew that i had to have it for my daughter's room. It's made very well and she really liked it. My only complaint is the length and width of it. Her window is on the smaller side so it does take up a large portion of the window (over half). I guess that's my fault though for not measuring before i bought it. All and all a good product for the money.
1,should be called the guide to pro football teams,"I was hoping that this book will have at least a little something about the game itself, or the history of the game. It is by far not all that you would ever need to know, even the team statistics are not arranged, but rather scattered all around the chapter. This book would probably help those who know nothing about football or the teams and wish to learn something quickly. I am a New Yorker and know very well the local bars and hangouts -- they were not mentioned in this book. The hotels suggested were outrageously expensive as well, that's not to mention that the stadium is in New Jersey, and the recommended hotels are in Manhattan. Why would the writers do that, I don't know -- there are tons of hotels in New Jersey which are better and less pricey. Overall, this book is no more a guide to football than a cook book is a guide to flirting."
4,A great old New Age sampler,"Hearts of Space 1: Universe Sampler 90The ""Hearts of Space 1"" is one of the first New Age CDs I ever bought. The music for me is just as fresh and good to listen to as when I bought it back in the early '90s. The sampler covers the top Hearts of Space artists of the time and gives someone who might want to try New Age music an entry point to see if it might be a musical style they might enjoy. I've bought other CDs based on what I've heard on this album and not been disappointed."
2,wipe toileting aid,"This is not an easy product to use. It requires a lot of practice to master this item. My mother who has arthritis can not use it with ease. However, it is a good product once the use of it is mastered."
4,Great Toy,"This toy, the Bratz's Lounge, is a great toy. It may or may not come with a doll, depending on where you get your lounge. Also included are a pair of slippers, (most likely pink) and 2 pillows. The edge of the lounge folds up like ""Craftmatic"" beds you see on tv. That feature is pretty cool, but it wrinkles up the fabric covering the lounge.The fabric that covers up the lounge is EXTREMELY soft and furry, like feathers or ""ripped"" satin. It feels like a cloud! The only problem with this fabric is that it is easily wrinkled by Bratz, for example if your Bratz sits on the lounge with the ""fur"" going the wrong way, trying to get it back down is quite tough. Good Luck.Another thing you want to watch out for is the legs of the lounge. They come off for storage, but be careful you don't lose one. :)Over all, this toy is FANTASTIC! It's a lot of fun, especially if you have the Slumber Party Bratz Dolls. Have fun and be careful about the legs. I SUGGEST YOU BUY THIS TOY!!!"
2,Too Out of Date,"Rawson's ""The Art of Southeast Asia"" was written in 1967, almost forty years ago. The current edition is a 1990 reissue in paperback; no changes or updates were made to the original text, and therein lies a real problem.In the last three decades, there have been tremendous advances in the study of the art and archaeology of SE Asia. This new knowledge has left Rawson's book sadly out of date. (By the way, this is not a criticism of Rawson's scholarship, just a recognition that time marches on.) Unfortunately many of Rawson's interpretations and identifications, which seemed quite reasonable given what was known in the 1960's, are no longer considered correct. For this reason, the book cannot be recommended for most readers."
3,"I am a music lover,but....","As an experienced music lover I am a little disappointed with the audio quality. The playing was good and in the Glenn Miller style, but lacked oomph, appeared a little flat.Some of the offerings on you tube featuring the Glen Miller Band recorded in the last decade were much better and more enjoyable.You had to tap along with that music."
3,Started out so promising,"This story started out so well. The cover is adorable, the drawings a great, we loved her name and Lettice's determined personality comes through. The ending was such a disappontment. Lettice works so hard and ends up being chosen for the starring role in the recital. Her family then (wrongly) assumes since she's a ""star"" (all this from just an ""end-of-term show"") that she's now to busy to be bothered with them and isn't interested in being with them. So, Lettice literally tosses off her dancing clothes and throws it all away to be just a rabbit? Most of the book is all about all her hard work to follow her dream and then it was like, oh well who cares. If the point was to show how to appreciate what you have at home, then the story ending left a lot to be desired and was terribly abrubt."
1,Resurrecting the Jack Chick Tracts,"The is just another regurgitation of the Jack Chick's tracts. Why read this when you can read the original Chick Tracts instead for free? The Jesuits were after all the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation and drew the ire of the most extreme of the fundamentalist protestant groups. It is little wonder that Jack Chick was antagonistic towards the Jesuits in particular.My father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather and I were educated by the Jesuits - they are indeed the greatest educators and there is nothing that beats a Jesuit liberal arts education which teaches you to think and understand logically and through the application of philosophical concepts. If there was a Jesuit conspiracy I would be in on it.Book is just another conspiracy theory without any foundation other than I heard it so it but be true."
2,kitty tee pee,"i bought this because i've had several cats who loved to scratch the tee pee. it kept them away from the furniture. the problem is this one is so cheaply made that my cats won't use it. they keep going back to the old one, which is falling apart. what gives?"
3,"Nice-looking, but that's the extent of it","While this box is nice-looking, the cardboard is not as thick as you'd think. As with everything made these days, the manufacturer uses the bare-minimum grade cardboard to still be able to call it ""cardboard."" At what point is the material really ""thick paper""? If the cardboard were much thinner, the box would collapse. If you're looking for durability, don't get this product line--I don't think these boxes can get knocked around much. Heaven forbid, the box gets wet--hasta la vista, boxy. A plastic--a durable plastic--would have been a better material choice. If you're looking for a showy box, which will hold light items, and which is not get moved much, it's an okay box. I feel the boxes of this product line are worth half of what they cost. The box is expensive for an ""somewhat showy average"" box. I may start ""crafting"" my own boxes."
5,Answers to many questions,"recently there was some question because this doll originally did not have a ring. I saw on a myth show that this doll was actually pulled from the shelves of a very large reatailer. This has since been solved and she wears a ring on her left hand, unlike the original.I hope this clears up some questions."
1,Yuck,My cousin got this toy and i am in 7th grade and dont think it is very approprite. They shouldnt be playing and seeing the dolls having babys. I think it is very gross and not good for young children.
5,I love this Barbie!,This is a helpful Barbie for the older/youngest sibling that is going to be getting a new brother or sister in the family. Not only is she fun for the child to play with but you can discuss being pregnant and then caring for a baby!
5,I love it,I love this doll. I got her last christmas. I don't even play with my other brbies as uch as I play with her. I think that is a great toy. Some people say the doll is inappropriate or whatever but they need to grow up. How is it inappropriate? But anyway I have the whole happy family except the grandparents (which I hope to get this chrismas)and I love them all. I recommend the whole happy family to every little girl in the world.
5,Very informative and educational barbie.,"I rate this doll excellent.Many people,or parents were outraged,because the doll was pregnant.I took it very well,because if a child asks me why the doll has a belly,I would explain to the child and would make it easier for me to explain to a kid.Some people were outraged,but I don't understand their outrage,because there are worse things on tv than a pregnant doll.I find the doll to be educational,for one the day I have a daughter and she asks me about sex or becomes curious about sex,I'll just give her an example of what happens to curious girls that want to experiment with sex,midge is a great doll for this example.Great doll great work MATTEL JUST EXCELLENT I HOPE YOU DO MORE JOBS LIKE THIS.THANK YOUSincerely:Hortensia AZUA"
5,Awesome!,"I'm a huge Forensic Files fan. I always go out of my way to watch it when it's on TV, but of course I can't always catch it. While I do consider myself a big fan of the show, there's plenty of episodes I haven't seen, so I gotta say this set is pretty perfect for me. I'm pretty positive I haven't seen ""Deadly Parasites"" so I'm excited for that. The theme of this set particularly appeals to me, I'm huge into mysteries of any kind, especially when forensics are involved!"
2,I spent more time rewinding than actually working out!,"I got this set because I wanted to switch up my workout routine. I had been doing Tamilee Webb's 'I want that body' and 'Tighter Assets - Cardio Blast' - which I loved, but wanted to try something new. The Firm Box is very cool (which is the reason for the two stars), but the videos are horrible! The first time I did Cardio Blast, there was only one move I had to watch over - The Firm series goes from one move to the next without telling you what's coming next, or explaining to you how the move goes. I would not recommend this at all. Cardio Blast and I Want That Body gave me excellent results in a few months - I'll keep the stepper for Tamilee's Weight Loss and toss these videos. They're just a waste of my workout time. If you're looking for an easy to follow, yet challenging workout, look no further than Tamilee Webb."
2,Not up to the mark,"I have read Robert Freeman's books on oracle9i and Rman. Bothare real classics. I was expecting the 10g book in the same league. I must say that this book is not up to the mark. It skims through lot of topics and does not give good examples. After completing book, It does not give any lasting impression. Just Stick with Oracle online documentation and save Money."
1,I dont regret owning this. -Jult Warfell,I was lost in the storyline but if they had the budget for a full season. I suppose I would enjoy it more. -Jult Warfell
4,Pretty god for relaxing,"I like this Cd at night, to fall asleep to, although many of the tracks are alike. I am also an ameture filmmaker, I used some tracks from this CD in a movie I've recently produced. Overall, It's an Ok CD"
3,"Great book, tough read","The theories in this book are rock solid, but unless you have a degree in mathematics, it will be a very tough read. There are lots of complex theories and equations that the everyday Joe might have a problem following.Also, this book mostly covers 1 deck blackjack which is not played in any casino in the world these days. Most casinos use 6-8 decks, but the theoretical aspect of the book holds true regardless on how many decks are used."
5,Oystein's most mature work,"Richly orchestrated, with lush arrangements and complex themes, this is Oystein's best album yet -- and that's saying something. Reviewers who have knocked this album seem to have been expecting something else; but this is an album you should come to with an open mind. It is also definitely an album for adult listeners. It is too refined to appeal to listeners used to the mushy end of New Age music, or who don't already listen to and enjoy serious orchestral music.Though the music here is never difficult, it isn't just background ambient schlock. Sevag's talents as a composer/arranger are at their peak, and this is the culmination of a career it has been a great pleasure to follow. Like so many Nordic musicians, he has found his way to a stately, rather grand style that ranges between Romantic and Baroque.Highly recommended."
2,Font Much Too Small,"This Ballantine Books edition of Glazier's useful book is printed in a font that is *very* hard to read. There have been/are other larger editions of this book that use larger fonts and are more readable. I suggest you try to obtain one of them.While searching for larger editions, I also discovered--but did not examine-software versions of this volume as well for both Microsoft-based and Macintosh computers."
4,Amazing!,This was recommended to me by an author in my MFA program. Of course I bought it and I'm so glad that I did. It has already been of great help.
5,One of the best purchases of my life,"Every writer needs this book. It is not negotiable. I was lucky enough to find a hardcover copy of Word Menu about five years ago on a bargain book table, and at least once a month, I rave to my wife about how much I love it.All true writers know that nouns and verbs are the meat of writing. This is what makes Word Menu great. The book puts words into categories like walking, hats, and ships. Suppose you know what a certain type of gun is, but you don't know the name--with Word Menu, you'll find the exact name of the thing.I read somewhere that the author, Stephen Frazier, made this book his life's work. He is now dead, but what a legacy to leave behind! I think the next step for someone eager (or crazy) enough would be to produce a visual word menu, because often we know what an item looks like, but we don't know its name. A great, great reference tool."
5,Music Straight from Heaven,"Sacred Treasures is one of the most beautiful discs I have listened to in a long time. The music evokes a heavenly choir. My personal favorite is track 12, Cherubim by Tchaikovsky. It moves me to a different place. A place I'd like to stay."
4,Lily is very real,"I have read both Private Lily and Sweet & Sour Lily to my girls, ages 7 and 5. They both love Lily because she sounds like them, she's between their ages, and she speaks and thinks just like them. The books are easy to read and short enough to finish in a few nights. Good!"
5,Essential for 10g DBAs of Highly Available Environments,"I work in the high availability support team at Oracle Support. Too often I see DBAs run into problems that cause downtime that could be avoided if they had understood and implemented sound HA practices. I have personally seen several cases where a company's database was down for hours or even days due to lack of a sound HA plan. These cases could have been avoidable if the DBA(s) had understood and implemented many of the techniques described in this book. This book describes each of the HA options available in Oracle 10g along with practical examples and labs. After reading this book, you will be armed with a tools you need to create a database environment that can survive multiple types of failures. By increasing your understanding of Real Application Clusters, Data Guard, Flashback, Streams, Recovery Manager, and other HA options, you can avoid unnecessary downtime and run a successful HA database.(...)"
5,Been using them for years,"Length:: 6:34 MinsI have been using my Rousseau router table insert for about 5 years now. I recently bought a replacement set of rings because I chewed up the inner ring. The replacement set fit perfect.In the attached video, you can see my router table in action as a build an arched top keepsake box from cocobolo. The neat feature about the box is the place for a picture framed inside the lid.For the rest of the videos in this series and video on other woodworking topics, visit www.EagleLakeWoodworking.comThanks for watching!Best Regards,John W. Nixon"
2,Link to the online examples not found in book ...,I read through the first 5 chapters of this book and did not find the link to the examples. On page 18 there's an entire paragraph or two that talks about the online examples. But does not provide a link to them. I was able to find the examples by googling for one of the source file names. I've provided the link below. Hope it saves someone the time of having to search like I did. [...]
3,Not for a beginner,"If you can download the entire 10g distribution, set it up, findthe author/book sample database, oracle text (?) and .....then the book is great. One day later ... aaaaa.I was learning sql on 10gExpress fine before this. These guys really need asupplimental read.me. There wasn't much in their samples download,which by the way, isn't with all the other oracle pubs,you have to go to 'lastest' publications."
1,"Where in the world did this ""non-fiction"" come from","Having known many of the people in this tragic story, I was shocked at the exaggeration and misquoting throughout the book. It was also very poorly written and difficult to follow. It is much more like trashy fiction than a respectable account of the truth."
2,Another delivery with wrong side panel!,"Like another customer, we received two identical side panels instead of A and B. Should be mirror images, but both were identical. Could not assemble...not a minor detail!!! Otherwise item appeared to be of decent quality and finish was what we wanted and expected. Because I get free shipping with a Prime item, because I am a very satisfied Amazon customer (with this one exception), and because there is still enough time to receive another and assemble it before Christmas when our granddaughter arrives, we are going to try again hoping the next one will be correct. From what other reviewers said, it appears that most were pleased with the product and did not have our problem. Crossing our fingers in CA!"
4,High Chair,"I was pleased with the chair, it was just what I was looking for. Went together easily and the price was perfect. Would recommend this to others."
1,"Disappointing, virtually unusable with Mac OS X","I've had the Cavalry CAUH2560 for some time, and it works OK with Windows XP. Unfortunately it scarcely works at all with our Mac OS X computers so it is essentially worthless for us and I'm about to replace it with a different make. (I.e., it works very occasionally if I reboot; but then may just as likely cut out in the midst of a file transfer.) It may well be that Cavalry's firewire/USB models would work better, but I no longer trust the manufacturer because its claim that the unit is usable with ""Apple: iMAC or G3, G4, iBook"" is misleading. For a backup system what is needed is reliability and full compatibility with different OS; and this model has not provided that. (And I can second another reviewer's comment that the instructions and FAQs are incomplete and poorly drafted.)"
3,OK - but won't completely close with an SD card inside,"On the positive side this multi-card reader (RW023-001) is advertised as being able to recognize XD - picture cards and it also recognized the SDHC card that I have, while an earlier model JumpDrive Trio (JDT, rev C) did neither of these things. On the negative side, this newer model did not close completely when an SD card was placed inside of it. It seems some dimensional tolerances are not quite right. I tried several different manufacturer's SD cards. However, the SD card was still able to be read, if firmly seated electrically. It still seemed rather odd that the flip up lid would only partially close but then not slide tight as it did with the JDT model."
2,kegelmaster,"I used this product regularly (3x per week) as instructed in the product DVD. One year later, the product broke in my hand as I was tightening the knob with springs in place. I returned the product to the seller and never received any acknowledgement during the last 6 weeks. The product worked well but doesn't last long for the cost of the item. I would strongly recommend against purchase and give this seller a very low rating for poor customer service."
4,Good door viewer,"Easy to install, clear to see through. Fits many thicknesses of doors, and with it installed about 5' 6' off the ground, you can see the welcome mat out front, the porch overhang, and the walls on either side of the door(very good viewing area basically). Subtracted a star for the price buts its probably what they have to charge for ""free"" shipping. I'd try your local hardware store first."
5,security at the door,this viewer was easy to install and provides excellent view; it is a very clear image; just install it according to your height and you'll be pleased.
5,Excellent Field of View,"We were replacing a door viewer we had purchased locally. The optics were very fuzzy. This Stanley V805 is wonderful. Nice finish, very wide angle and super clear optics. I am very pleased with my choice."
4,"Easy to install, nice optics.","These were installed on my door to my garage. I wanted to be able to see if I had closed the garage door without opening the inside door. They were very easy to install with the instructions provided, took about 5 minutes. The optics I think are pretty good, what you would expect out of a peep hole. The finish is good, and there have been no problems so far."
4,window alternative,"In my camper design project, I am not ready for windows yet. I used one of these door viewers on my door, and am putting one on the other side of the trailer in lieu of a window. The view is clear, and very extensive in daylight. I can't see in from the outside of it, which was a plus in deciding to purchase the second one. In the yard-light-dark it has a bit of interior reflection. When it rained, it got foggy for a while. I think in a covered exterior door situation, I would give it 5 stars. I may get a third."
3,Great film... no extras,"Sabata is a great adition to the Italian Western genre: the characters are well rounded, the plot is involving, the music is cool and, above all, it stars Lee Van Cleef and William Berger.There are no extras, only a set of trailers for other westerns (Italian and otherwise). Sabata is a sadly neglected film which I think could do with a special edition.At least it's uncut."
5,Dynamics of Tranquility LIVE,Steve over the years has evolved musically in many ways. One of his greatist achivements is his way of blending ancient instruments (didjeridoo etc.) and modern synthesizers into a soundscape. This CD shows how dynamic Steve can be in a live setting using the blend mentioned above. At times very powerful and in other times tranquil. It is a ride so turn up the volume and enjoy!
5,Brilliant!!!,"I bought both ""Sledge Hammer seasons"" to my son for a birthday present...I don't remember how many times he said: ""Thank you, thank you, thank youuu, it's sooo great, what a gift!!! (Must order them myself...)Janne/Sweden"
4,Just as I remembered Sledge,"A special nostalgia set for my family. The first episode seems to always be the best, though. Ol' Sledge is back again, and what a hoot!"
5,Is it funny?,"Is it funny..It is more than that. Is it hilarious? More than that...It is Sledge Hammer. He knows, what he is doing! I'd give 50 stars...Walter"
5,Laughter is the Best Television!,"Sledgehammer! is back, and I love every minute of this show. I haven't laughed so hard since . . . well, since I originally viewed Sledgehammer! back in the 80s! Here is a loveable cast of characters, a little off beat, kinda crazy, but believable in a strange sort of way. Alan Spenser has created the very funniest sort of humor, because it is just one tiny step over the line from reality. And all this goes back to a time when we could still laugh at and with ourselves; before the idea of ""political correctness"" stole that right away from us.If you are or were a Sledgehammer! fan, you already know you have to have this set . . . so what are you waiting for. It's a bargain! If you haven't seen Sledgehammer! before? Well, you are in for a real treat, so treat yourself. This is Dirty Harry with a sense of humor, the Sargent Joe Friday they never told us about and the real answer to restoring law and order. Trust me, I'm a trained professional!"
5,"""Picasso"" is Martin at His Best","Not only is ""Picasso"" a hilarious romp into Steve Martin's genius imagination, the play also tackles the ""Big Issues"" that make our culture tick. While discussing Art (capital ""A"") and Existence (capital ""E""), the characters also hum with humanity and integrity. Leave it to Martin to bring Einstein to the masses."
5,See it staged,"Picasso and Einstein meet for coffee. I saw this produced at Cambridge's American Repertory Theater and returned twice in order to get my fill. To date, this is Martin at his finest. His theme, the dependant and invisible relationship between the seemingly disparate worlds of art and mathematical science, is deftly explored with the whimsy of his previously published short stories. Please, do not be swayed by previous reviewers who are thrown by effects based on simple theatrical devices such as asides or sotto voces. These forays into the audience (to me) represented the Theory of Relativity's elastic concept of time and space as applied to the artistic presentation of story. Without having to bow to the box-office-numbers God of film, Martin is free to run with his wonderful intellect. I suggest you come along for the ride."
4,Honestly...,"I've never read the other plays in this book, so I can only comment on Lapin Agile. This play alone is worth purchasing the volume for. If you are familiar with the other scripts or plays that Martin has written, this will not dissapoint. The pacing is perfect. The humor is amazing. The visitor is hilarious."
5,Jeff Wilke 1000-Piece Puzzle - Pirates Paradise,I am really happy that I purchased this puzzle. It went together nicely and the colors are brillant especially the sunset.I plan on hanging it and it will add a great touch to the room. I would highly recommend his puzzles. I also bought Jeff Wilke 1000-Piece Puzzle - Light House but haven't started that one yet.
5,A story of touching courage and hope,"This is a book I discovered on a visit to an African bookshop and read out of curiosity.The story is about a woman and her daughter who are both destitute after the death of the husband and the lack of any family support due to the vagaries of African family politics. The story centres on the woman's quest to get her daughter educated as this is all that she has left to bequeath to her. Her quest takes her to her in-laws and finally to trying to sell some goods at the market in town to raise the money for school fees and a uniform. Her naivety coupled with her determination makes you empathise with her and the words of the author told against a backdrop of poverty, disease and illiteracy add poignancy and charm to the story. The book is not long but at the end it fills you with hope and leaves you wanting more. I fully recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have an insight into the mind of a typical African woman."
4,Professional Looking Business Cards,"I am very happy w/ the product. My business cards look VERY professional, there are NO frayed edges that most business cards leave. My only issue is they jam if I use side one, but work fine when I print on side two. That may be my printer?"
5,AN ALTOGETHER SIGNIFICANT WORK,"Dr. Slaton skillfully traces the evolution of modern building construction practice as well as the rise of the engineering field that made it possible. As an aside, she successfully argues that the emergence of modern architectural ""design"" was less of a european phenomenon than generally supposed. The research is thorough, and presented in a very entertaining fashion. The book's well worth the time and money."
2,Very disappointed,Have to agree that these shoes do not wear well at all. Too bad they are so cute but I think I'll have to go back to Robeez and try Tredz.
3,True to life fiction from someone who has clearly been there,"This story has all the elements of good entertainment but could be non-fiction. Mr. Harrell has clearly ""been there, done that"". You will enjoy this story and will likely learn a few things."
5,cool toy,totally cool everyone who sees it wants one or more wish i could get a commission i probably sold 20 of them
2,Fell apart the first day,"I thought this product would be alot of fun and generate alot of laughs for the kids. They did think it was fun at first, however the hardware came apart quite frequently. I saw a piece from it on the floor the other day. I guess they got tired of putting it back together all the time. Another toy for the garbage :("
5,whut!,This is Pac no doubt bout it...he just made is voice a little aigu ....have u listen i give a shout on ras-sa-rec-shun cd...this is Pac! he just try to put some confusion!
5,Still reading,"I have this book for over two years now and I keep coming back finishing it. It is hard read especially if you've been in abusive relationship and struggling with understanding who's fault was it and what is my part in it?It is written by a man, who does not have blaming attitude toward women and trying to look at the situation from all ends. I very much appreciate this book. As a new in counseling profession for me it is a must read."
3,Not bad but has flaws,"This isn't a bad gun but it needs to be sighted in,i shot my friend with it at point blank and he didn't feel it at all.Durable but if misued it can break.My sister threw it on the ground in our house and the screw sockets in the stock-fold mechanism broke..."
3,"Was hoping for more. This would be great for kids, 7+","I bought this to be able to record lectures and put them onto CD or listen to them in my car. The Wolverine works on one AAA battery which is simple and easy to replace. Since it's a flash drive, you can jostle and drop (lightly) it and it still keeping running. The voice recording quality is very poor and playback is only on the unit. you can't transfer files to the computer or to cd. The earbuds it comes with aren't very good quality as expected.Over all the machine is pretty easy to use with USB plug in and your mp3 files transfer within seconds from your computer. no software necessary for ME/2000/XP. This is a great simple mp3 player or portable file device for starters or the young, but not for folks like me that wan to do more with their files. Easy navigation from file to file, but it doens't allow for multiple playlists. It' small and sleek with a protective rubbery coating to prevent scratches."
5,Incredible Show!,"I had no idea this show even existed until long after its network run ended. I can totally relate to this show because I'm at the stage of my life where these guys are. I love how the characters are developed. They're all very real, with just the right amount of real humanity, no underplaying or overexaggeration. I can't recommend this show highly enough, especially to those like me who are staring down the prospect of middle age."
3,It could have been sooo much better,"I liked this book, especially the letters exchanged by the two main characters; they were very witty. However, when they meet in person, there's not the same spark, and the plot becomes a bit boring. So, not one of my favorites, but not a total waste either."
3,Only because Brockway is so good.,"I didn't like this book. I had to force myself to finish it. The reason for my dislike was Lily. She was so cold. I couldn't warm up to her at all. I didn't feel she deserved Avery's love. It wasn't until the last few pages that she said she would marry him. I know it was because of her background, but you should be able to feel something for the heroine, sympathy, empathy, or admiration. I felt none for her. I thought she was not a good character. We are all entitled to our opinions. Most people liked this book. I didn't. This book was one of the few Connie Brockway books that I don't have on my keeper shelf. I'm glad I read it. Most reviews were glowing. It just wasn't for me."
2,Not worth it.,The information in this book can be obtained from the library or on the internet if a person wants to look. This book is good if you need a general guide and starting point.
2,I hope I get this when promised...,"I purchased this Streamlight on March 26, 2012, and today is March 29th and this item still says it has not shipped. I need this as a gift and I am hoping to get it by the promised day."
4,Happy with new HD,"I replaced my original 30G HD in a Dell Dimension 4100 without any trouble. The WD HD is working fine and the computer is slightly faster and more stable. By staying under 135G I did not have to upgrade the BIOS.My only disappointment is the HD did not come with any mounting hardware, software or instructions. Turns out I did not need the hardware and was able to get the software and instructions from WD's website."
2,Have very little to do with Christmas,I didn't like this DVD most of the cartoon have nothing to do with Christmas ... if you are expecting Christmas cartoon stay away from this one.
4,Great Book,"I really liked this book, I grew up in Kaneohe and I now live in Arizona. This book made me a little home sick."
3,A must for the mature witch,"This is a great little book for a witch who has been practicing for a few years. For beginners I would not suggest it. If you are a witch that follows the creed ""An harm none..."" you can use this book as a good start but change it to be more ethical. If you are into Gypsy craft than this book is the perfect book to start with. Either way it is a good addition to a witches library but use with care. Blessed BE"
3,The Good Spellbook is an ok Book,The Good Spellbook is for experienced witches and wizards only because the spells are oversimplified making the beginner have little to work with.
5,G- sus H. k(cry)st!!!,"WHAT,YOU NEED YER HAND HELD??this is ACID KING's new releaseplace in yer cart,pay for the thing, receive & enjoy -dont be an A -hole"
1,Lame,"I am a theater teacher at an international school. I read the reviews and bought the book in anticipation of using it with my 8th grade students. I was too embarrassed to bring it out. The monologues in the book were awful. The funny ones fell flat, and the dramatic ones made me gag. They were so stereotypically sappy. This book might be okay to use with younger children, but I would never use it with my middle schoolers."
3,39 experiments,"The book is filled with fun experiments. Many use the same reaction principles to teach different lessons. Kids will become bored working through the entire book, but there are a lot of fun activities."
3,Not Bad,"is important to have a partner in order to have control over the premature eyaculation and the book is not that clear it should be more simple, but it as some points that I really like it I'll give it 80/100"
3,Euclid's Window,"I wish this book had been better. The math was dumbed down and superficial. Not that I learned nothing from it, but I too often felt like we'd just got started on some subject that piqued my curiosity when the author would drop it like a hot potato and move on to something else.Mlodinow could've spent less time on the pointless bibliographical material (which I generally enjoy if it adds in some way to the learning, but this material, like the math itself, was too sketchy and superficial to add anything) and more on the math.Lynn"
2,Not Tasty for my Dog,"These days it is not easy to find US made dog natural treat with relatively low price, and having treated my 3 year old Westie long time with Healthy Partner beef/turkey strips, I gave Zuke's a try; yet as soon as I opened the bag, I knew that my dog would not like it; it dosen't look good or smell good and I don't even like to taste it, how my dog would like it ?"
5,Our favorite treat from Zuke's,"I have been buying this product since sep 2010. My dog loves this the most. He sometimes refuses other treats but never this. So it must be good. It comes in one and a half inch squares. It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training. We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price."
5,Important book,"As the review above suggests, this important new book should be compared with The Tao of Physics and read by anyone interested in the future of medicine, either western or Oriental. Milburn's synthesis of the two different systems is clearly laid out, and can serve as a review for those already familiar with some of the concepts. Recommended!"
4,"Preserve the environment, or drill for oil?","The discovery of oil on a family property initiates a series of events including murder. Crofts keeps the reader, as well as Inspector French, working hard to identify the murderer and discover how the crime was done.This is one of the last and one of the best detection novels by Freeman Wills Crofts. Suspense and intrigue are maintained steadily."
4,My first pair of pointy-toed shoes...,"....and I didn't know that I should have ordered them at least a half-size larger. This is a georgeous shoe, but I've only worn them for about 20 minutes. The patent leather is top-quality, but the heel design was the selling point...true designer styling. If it wasn't such a hassle, I would have exchanged them. I'll probably sell them on the website marketplace at my company...there's lots of well dressed women there, but not, too many with a size 7 1/2."
1,Save your money,"We were actually excited by the promo running for this one, so we ordered it. when it arrived it seemed like a nice one. Then we used it and found the sound quality lacking and whoever designed it had for some reason decided to put the opening for the mouth piece on the opposite side and away from your mouth which makes it hard for the other caller to hear you. Save your money and keep looking."
5,"Good optics, but heavy","I am very satisfied with the lens, good optics, even on edges of the image. However, the lens are pretty heavy, it is hard to use it from the hand. But with a monopod I took nice animal photos from great distance.Zoom lock is a nice feature if you carry the camera over your shoulder. It keeps the set ""short"" (no unintended extension if lens are looking down)"
4,zug des lebens,"The story line, acting and authenticity of surroundings, clothing and Yiddish propriety and music are excellent. The story is humorus on a subject that really isn't and it is all very well done.The negative side is the lack of access to this video for American or region 1 players. I have yet to locate a DVD that is playable on region 1, outside of French with English subtitles and French does not sound at all correct for a Romanian yiddish community. It would be much better make this DVD available in English or better yidddish with English subtitles. Every synagogue should have this DVD. The version I have is German but for European or region 2 and I have been unable to find anyone to convert it, although a freind has been able to download it with region free software for me."
4,It Works,"It pretty much does what it's described as doing. I like to always have some on hand just in case I need to reseat my CPU. Unlike many other folks, I can't say I've spent a lot of time comparing the temperatures of one thermal compound to another."
4,Top-Notch Carpet Cleaner,"This Hoover SteamVac is the best I've owned. It made quick work cleaning my house and motor home. The automatic soap dispenser is a nice feature since it allows switching from soap to rinse without changing the water. After rinsing, a couple of additional passes over the carpet left it almost dry. The floor scrubber worked well too and actually left tile floors COMPLETELY dry after a couple of passes. The hand tools are a different story and Hoover needs to look into ways to increase suction so more of the soap, dirt and water is picked up. The carpet remained quite wet after using the hand tools. I highly recommend this SteamVac for open areas. For small areas that need hand tools, I use my old GreenMachine(c) instead."
4,Great Carpet Cleaner,"I bought this carpet cleaner based on a combination of reviews at Consumer Reports and Amazon. I cleaned the whole house this weekend and was surprised at what all we sucked up. Stains that were in the carpet from the previous owners came right out with no extra effort. It was easy to use.The only negative thing is that the upholstery tools don't seem to wrap up very nicely and store on the unit as well as they advertise. Given that you have to completely unwrap them and plug them in at the base each time you use them, it makes more sense to keep them stored somewhere else anyway."
4,good steam cleaner,"Cleaner does a good job all most carpets. Use it for small stains and high traffic areas. We still use Stanley Steamer usually in spring to do entire house. Although this unit does a good job on spots it is way too time consuming to do large areas and leaves area too wet. Had older version and developed a crack in the water supply canister. This seemed to be a common problem with the older units. I hope they improved on this. Also spot brush didn't hold up well on older unit either, it broke within first two years."
3,"Good vac, sketchy Amazon","I ordered this new from Amazon (""ships and sold from Amazon.com"") and when it showed up it was obviously a refurbished model, slightly dirty and dinged with a piece missing. It's only missing the cord wrap hook, so I used it while I wait for Hoover to send the piece (their support is barely competent). The good news is that the vacuum works great and after a few sessions I was able to get rid of the cat smell left from a previous occupant.Again I'm only giving thee stars because of the shady refurbished way Amazon sold it as new, but I guess that's what I should expect for getting the product as cheap as Amazon offers. Hurray for the race to the bottom!"
4,IT BROKE after 3 months!,It broke after a few months! The brushes stopped turning. repair guy said 4170 to fix. he said he gets these in all the time and they are made of cheap plastic parts. he recommened not getting another one because they need constant repairs. It worked great while it was working. now if they could just make them to last more than a few months!For some reason I can't change my star rating. otherwise it would be 1 star.
1,Worked great -- and then it broke,"We purchased this unit on Amazon about a year ago (15 months or so). It cleans carpets better than the big name brand guys with steam extraction units hooked up to their van (we had them come out twice, then we got this). This unit also did an OK job on tile, but the squeegee on the front fit the unit poorly and would fall off. So the reviews that note the unit cleans well are all spot on.Problem is, today when using the unit, 3 different plastic parts all broke. This was in the course of normal use, and it wasn't being manhandled at the time. Not only is this unacceptable, but the repair parts from Hoover are nearly $100. Given the other similar reviews about lack of durability, I'd only buy this unit if you are willing to replace it every 6 months to a year."
3,Carpets OK - Hard Floor Forget it,"OK,On carpet its pretty OK. Hoover could make it self propelled as its heavy for this old lady to push around.On hard floor -- for get it. Its the great mud machine. It dosen't scrub well, it dosen't pick up the water well, it does make some nice mud that it leaves all over your floor.Also the squeege thing likes to fall off. I wanted to purchase one machine to do carpets and tile floors. That was a mistake. I will have to buy a machine just for the tile floors.The good news is a got a pretty good carpet cleaner, and its building up my arm strength -- who needs a gym when I have this Hoover carpet cleaner.PS I love me new Hoover wind tunnel self power vac. I haven't jamed it yet and I have messey pets."
4,Lifesaver,"My carpets were a mess, mostly due to my single large dog.I actually bought this at Sears and brough it home today. Cleaned my carpets. It got all the stains and the stink out and about an hour later they are mostly dry. I live in a dry climate.Very happy. It was easy to use and easy to clean. I did spill a bit, but nothing too shocking for hauling water filled objects around. My carpets looks just as good as they do when a pro comes to the house.I bought the Platinum collection Pet plus detergent and I'm concerned that my dog may have a reaction to it. The smell is very strong. I've ordered the anti-allergen detergent, because it is odor free."
2,Beware of tank leaks!,Worked great for several months and we were very happy with it. Then parts started breaking. Tank cracked and values leaked. Thought it was just a fluke but when took it in for repairs they said almost all of them start doing this after time and the companey started making new parts (better material) because of this problem. Paid $100 to get new parts and works great now. Make sure yours has the new tank design before buying.
5,Does a great job!,"I've used it on carpeting, tile flooring, and carpeted stairs. It did a great job. The wand for cleaning stairs doesn't have the same suction power as the main unit, but it did a great job getting the stairs clean. It took them a little longer to dry (overnight), which is not a problem. Cleaning tile flooring worked well too, and the rinse feature is very useful here. Much less wear and tear on my back using this maching versus a traditional mop. The squeegee picks up much of the water. If you continue to go over it repeatedly, you can probably get all of the water up, but I chose to use a towel to get the remaining water. The attachments are very easy to switch out. The unit is easy to take apart to clean. I highly recommend this machine."
4,"Works well, durability questionable","Cleaner arrived with one of the hold down latches for the waste water tank broken. I called the support line and they promised to send out a new one. They sent me the wrong sided one, I needed right, they sent left. I called and they said they were sorry, but the right was on back order and I should get it later on. I used industrial tape to hold the tank on. The right one arrived a few weeks later,followed by two more right ones. That's right, I got a total of 3 right side latches and 1 left side latch.I have an old dog that pees on the carpet often and the cleaner is easy to use and works well. I am a little concerned about the long term durability based on my broken latch."
1,Too heavy and it doesn't heat the water!,If you want to superheat your water first and then carry it over to this behemoth and then work up a heck of a sweat pushing it around then here it is. Otherwise it's a cruel joke.
1,Arrived broken,"The first time I took it out of the box and tried to use it, it wouldn't work. Water spilled out all over from the hoses in the handle. I have just spent an hour trying to find a repair shop to fix my new machine. Presently it is just a heavy unusable thing in the way. Very frustrating for something that costs so much!"
1,You can have mine!!!,"We'v had this Hoover for about 2 years and Im ready to junk it. After the first 3 or 4 cleanings, I thought the unit worked rather well, but then the problems started. First the scrubber wheels stoped spining. The brush drive uses plain steel gear pins that rusted due to the fact they are directly exposed to the fluids entering the machine! After cleaning and relubing these parts, it was working again. Then the leaking started. I replaced the rubber O-ring seals and it still leaked. I called Hoover and they mailed me a new water bucket and bucket base that had been slightly redesigned, It only driped slightly at first and now with about 4 uses, it litteraly has water running out of it!!!! This is without a dout, the worst possible design for fluid transmission in and out of a machine. Other than that, it cleans great!"
4,Steam,"I just purchased this cleaner based on a ""Consumer Reports"" review. I have used it only once and I think it did a good job. My only complaint is that I think calling it a ""SteamVac"" is a misnomer since I can see no heating element in the machine, the only heat is the temperature of the water you put in it and you certainly can't get steam from the tab, and as you use it the water cools no steam involved."
2,Not Bad at first...,"I initially liked the cleaning power of this machine. I have 6 animals and it seemed to work well for the first couple of times, then the clean water tank leaked, gasket sticks open and the springs came off the dirty water holder. So I was going to send it back, but had an inkling that Sears may have parts. Going to check on this. I even looked on line for solutions, one was to use vaseline on the gasket, didn't work."
3,So far? So Sol.,"I bought this after reading reviews various places. I have this basically off white (ecru?) carpet that I despise - it was here when I bought the house. So I let it get pretty dirty because I was trying to figure out my options. This option was cheaper than replacing the carpet. So I tested it on a very dirty spot, it was actually black! The thing worked but I had to go back and forth over it for a while (several times....) to get the stain out.The stain came back. Not sure what that is about - probably not the fault of the steamer/cleaner but of the carpet owner. The stain is less intense so I assume that it was diluted by the cleaning and then seeped back up the fibers as the carpet dried.I'll get serious here soon and try again."
1,unhappy with my purchase,For the first two years the product worked great. As of recent I have found that the tubes leading from the clean tank have begun to leak excessive amounts of water which defeats the purpose of cleaning my carpet and tile floors. Now I must send it for repairs which is not what I expected with minimal use. Very frustrating to say the least.
2,Problems since we bought it...,"It was supposedly a highly rated unit. Every time we have used it, it leaks out the bottom. Hoover sent a tank after we called.....seems like they know it is a problem....however, still leaking water....consider alternatives."
2,All Terrain? Please,"Borrowed this unit from a friend, to check it out before buying, they had only used it once. The soap and water containers leak, not to mention the container fell out of the vacuum when i went down a 5mm ridge. And yes it was in properly. Then the blue handle which locks it into place snapped in half. A tube of epoxy later, and its ok again, but still leaking a lot.Carpets get cleaned yes, but the build is very flimsy."
2,Do you want a product that only lasts for a few uses?,"I wonder how many people who rated this item highly wish they had kept it for more than a couple of months before writing their review. Things you are guaranteed of: The thing will leak dirty water all over the floor. And possibly, the soap dispenser will stop working. And finally, when less than a year or 10 uses have gone by, you'll be stuck with a brokeny machine that makes a loud whirring noise.The cost per use is ridiculous on this machine. You might as well just rent a more powerful cleaner from the store and clean half as often--you'd still come out ahead considering your frustration level would be lower!"
4,"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner, All-Terrain, F7452900",Works very well. The reservoirs for the clean and dirty water are a little on the small side and require frequent changing. Happy overall and would purchase again
2,Short Life,"I bought this product over a year ago to clean up after my two dogs. For the first six months or so, it was a real life saver - easy to use, worked great, and really sucked up the dirt and water. But then I started having problems with it. First the valve on the clean water tank started leaking. Now the trigger release valve is shot. (At least I think that is the problem.) Whenever I put the clean water tank on the machine, the water streams out of it. Like other reviewers, I, too, have had problems finding parts for it. I can appreciate that some people think this is a great machine, having only used it once or twice, but to that I say: use it for a year and then tell me what you think."
5,The Best Thing,"Richard Page has gone a long way from Pages in the late 70's with Steve George, Mr.Mister from 1982-1987. And solo projects in the mid 90's. Richard Page still has that good music of his. The updated version of Stevie Wonder's Heaven is 10 zillion light years aways sounds like a Mr. Mister song because Pat Mastelotto does the drums and Steve Farris did the gutiar. And it was also very nice that Richard Page dedicated this album to his Mother who died in 1996 when this album was released. Overall, this album was very good music that relaxes and soul soothing."
2,Visually pleasing but lacking substance,"It is tempting to look at this book and its many colorful images and pleasing layout and expect a good informative read. I found, however, that it is not really suitable for use as a guidebook either for novices or for experts. If you are looking for a book that tells you how to use the program, look elsewhere. The author provides many step-by-step examples of how he does things, but provides no background whatsoever on the tools he uses, why he uses them, and what they really do. You really cannot *understand* the program using this book, so its not for beginners. For experts, the how-to steps are probably not advanced enough. All of which leaves the reader wondering exactly who this book is targeted at."
1,"Shoddy, unsafe crap",Words can't describe the horribly inferior quality of these barstools.I had to take them apart and glue them back together just to try to make them safe enough to sit on. Then I was still afraid they would collapse and someone would bust their head open on the tile floor.I ended up throwing them out just to get rid of the image in my head of someone spilling their brain on my floor.
3,"Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me.","Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me. It has a good smell of coconut skin & not too sweet. However, I prefer the Kind Bar Almond & Apricot without yogurt (love it!) since the bar is softer/chewier. If you like a bit sweeter taste, choose the one with yogurt."
5,Convenient and taste great,I use this at work when I do not have much time to eat. They sustain me very well.
5,"Handy, nutritious, delicious energy/breakfast/candy BAR","It is hard to describe what these bars actually are. First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet. TA DA! Enter the KIND BAR company. These work as candy bars. YUMMY. These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals. These definitely are nutrition bars. Packed with good natural ingredients, these bars are great to keep in your desk or pop into your purse for any emergency hunger attacks."
2,Delicious but loaded with calories and food miles,"These tasted so much better before I read the nutrition label. Also, I felt really bad when I realized how far they traveled to my Trader Joe's shelf in Massachusetts. So though they really are delicious, I can't justify buying this product again because though it is indeed ""kind"" in the sense of being vegetarian, it isn't really all that kind to the planet -- or my diet."
1,Defective,"I gave this DVD as a Christmas gift to a friend with scoliosis. When I later asked if she tried it, she confessed that she had, but the DVD was blank. This was months later - after the Amazon return policy was invalid and I had long since thrown away the shipping papers. So I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you can try it out immediately and be prepared to return it if defective."
3,So Many Screws,I didn't know there were so many different types of screws. These were not exactly the kind that I wanted. I give these screws a 3 out of 5.
1,"So, so bad...",Ugh...let me start by saying that somehow my 6 year old son loves this video...and it does teach him basic stranger danger lessons.But from the adult perspective this thing sucks. Seriously. I have seen better video quality from elementary school student productions. Blah.
5,Love at first read,"A friend of mine suggested that I pick up this little paperback book titled ""The Deal."" Normally I take his suggestions without question, but when I read the back copy, I was a little hesitant. Still, keeping an open mind, I bought the book and...I read it in one sitting.The characters completely jumped off the page and begged me to fall in love with them. Cochrane and Lambert deftly handle their characters and aren't afraid to let a reader get really mad at them one minute, then remember why they like them so much the next. It speaks truthfully to real human relationships that anyone with a heart can relate to. Bravo! Go out and buy the book and devour it as I did and will again."
4,Red Midnight,"The book takes place in Mexico. Santiago and his little sister are trying to escape from being killed by the solders who have already killed everyone in their village. Santiago escaped to his uncle's house with his little sister. When they arrived there, his uncle's neighbors were there watching his possessions. If the solders found out that Santiago ran away, they would kill him and his little sister. They will have to sail to the United States. The neighbors gather up all the food they have, for it will have to last for 20 days. The neighbor will sail with Santiago and his little sister faces some exiting adventures. You'll just have to read the book to find out!I liked this book. I liked this book because I always wanted to know what happened next, or if they ever reached the United States. I couldn't put it down until I reached the end. I would recommend this book to any one who likes a fun adventure."
1,What if you have a urinary tract infection?,"Mmmmm yummy! Common cold? Pee on it. Tastes good, too! What the heck are you people thinking? You aren't gonna pee out anything you didn't already take in. Except by the time you pee it, your body has extracted its favorite nutrients.It's like eating out of the dumpster of your favorite restaurant. Or more like the port-a-potty.So, who wants to take their wine glass out back and scoop up that stuff and drink up!"
3,Just ok,These are ok but they are not as good as the original Dr. Scholls Arch Supports. The originals provided a lot more support.
5,Great little book,Great little bookGr8 material to sit withand from a selfless person.Im enjoying it.
3,has its ups and downs,"The book has absolutely everything you need to know word-for-word to get certified in NALS. It comes from more of a nursing perspective so little details like how to operate the jackson-reiss and anatomy of the airway will be extremely redunant for respiratory therapists.I found the CD-ROM included was very buggy in my computer. While it was helpful to see everything happening at once, the videos' content should have been more closely watched, since during a chapter about mechanical ventilation saying bag at around a rate of 40, will clearly show the person at the head ventilating at a rate of closer to 70 or 80."
3,Misleading product title,"To be clear, there are 2 chairs in this package, not 4... don't be fooled by the product title 523/4 is the model number."
5,Amazing--90 billion out of 5,"This CD is really amazing. My favorite vocal songs are 'Serenade' and 'For Fruits Basket'.Serenade is a slow but beautiful song. They should have played it when Tohru was holding Kyo near the end of the second-to-last episode. It really goes with the two of them. When it gets in your head you don't want it out. And there's a nice instrumental section that goes really well with the songs--especially when the drums come in ^_^. All in all, really beautiful.For Fruits Basket was translated and the translated one was the opening of the English DVD's. A very beautiful song, both translated and original Japanese. The instrumental version of it makes me cry. It goes to Kyo and Tohru so well again.If I had time to review every song on this CD, I would, but I can't right now. If you really love Fruits Basket--or if you cried at the end--this CD is a must."
2,not a official biography,"if you think you will see footage from his glory years think again it's a bunch of people that used to work with him in the past recalling their experiences with him no significant performance footage is shown, a waste of time."
3,Not happy about this,If your dog likes Naked bars then this is the same consistency. It's hard and sometimes my dog will eat it sometimetimes he'll just leave it. It's quite hard.
1,Pets don't like this one.,"We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor."
5,Dogs love them!,"They smell rather smokey, so I wasn't sure my dogs would like them. They are rather particular. But they love them. Just re-ordered more!"
4,"Not Really ""Jerky""","It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape. Think Pringle vs. a potato chip. Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides! The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye. A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for."
4,Dog loves them,"Inured 10year old dog loves these treats. They were not what I thought I was ordering, but I am so glad I ordered these. They are the perfect size for the dog, not too big. She likes the lamb. I will buy these again."
4,A must,"I didn't get this when I bought the Sansa and now I have numerous scratches on the screen. This kit a good value. The protector screen is very useful. The leather glove is good, but blocks the record button, makes the menu button a bit hard to press and is just a tad to narrow for the usb connector. These are pretty minor though. The case is top notch. If you have a Sansa and you are looking for a good valued case...this is it."
3,Sansa E 200 Travel Case,"I got this case because the Sansa E 200 will scratch easily. I give it a 3 star because at the bottom of the case where you connect your cable, the leather straps are to close and you have to move the leather out of the way to plug in your sansa. I Also have the inmotion speakers for the sansa and this also makes it inconvenient. The film is a little difficult to put on because of air bubbles. As for protection, it does a good job, especially with the hard case when traveling."
1,Don't waste your money!,This item would be ok at best if it could fit your player and accessories- but it cant. It is too tight of a fit to fit the items that comes with it! If this case costs say $2 or $3 maybe- just maybe. I bought it and have never used anything that comes with it except the screen protector. Save your money and just buy a screen protector!!! I want to give the item zero stars but Amazon won't allow it. You can buy the same accessories that come with this case cheaper if you just buy non- OEM products.
2,"WTF $9,999 price!","I thought I'd give this item a try, the reviews are pretty good. What kind of price is this anyway? Is it a big lot price for 5000 units? IS IT FILLED WITH PLATINUM COINS? A purchase is impossible until this typo or joke or whatever it is is discovered and fixed. I didn't want to rate it at all but I guess you have to. Please Amazon fix this price gaff."
4,5 Piece travel case set,This order was filled and received in just 3 days. The leather case is well made and fits well although it needs some type of arm band or a clip for workout shorts. It does have a loop on the back for a belt to go through. The larger case has room for storage of ear buds and is padded to protect the player from damage. A clear plastic square the size of the display is identifies as an aid to remove the plastic covering the dispay during shipping - and I dropped it in the trash.
2,nope,"sorry but, the first album was awesome, the second one was great, but this one... nah... don't think so. They turned bland and boring and I quickly tossed this away. Luckily, a few months later in '99 Dave Lombardo kick some a$$ with his talents on TESTAMENT's ""The Gathering"", which is better than ""Solidify"" 100 times fold. Hell, it blows away anything Grip Inc ever put out but thats not their fault. Yet, on another note, if comparing this release to the likes of ""Rob Zombie"" and ""Powerman 5000"", I can see how one could consider this a 5 star album... It just amuzes me that some people are so un-educated in metal music... If you want HEAVY and ANGRY bands, check out The Forsaken, Dying Fetus, Carnal Forge, Hypocrisy, Decapitated, Behemoth, Immortal, Immolation, Incantation... the list goes on forever... go to metal-archives.com to find info on over 8,000 metal bands in every subgenre."
1,Archway Oatmeak Cookies,I would love to write a review but I have not received the product yet.Please check into this for me.Thank you.
3,Spanish Christmas Music,"We're raising our son to be tri-lingual, with English, Spanish and French. I've really hunted for songs and books in Spanish and French. And there are some really good ones that I would listen to even without my son in mind. This one is OK. It reminds me of Christmas Carols at a school concert."
5,Review of From Judgment to Passion,"Rachel Fulton really wrote two studies in one book here. The first deals with the development of the devotion to the crucified Christ from 800 to 1100. Her most original idea in this section is the linking of the emerging devotion to the crucified Christ and the Eucharist to millennial anxieties. The second study focuses on the emerging devotion to Mary as the compassionate mother of Christ in commentaries on the Song of Songs. Overall, this is an excellent work. I would like to have seen more discussion of sermons preached on Marian festivals during the twelth century."
4,Side Sleeper Pillow,Pillow is everything I expected. Luckily I ordered two because I needed two to make me comfortable. Worth the price.
4,Fluffy pillow gives good support and stays cool,"I'm allergic to down so I have to order hypoallergenic types of pillows. I ordered one of these to try since it was on sale for 12 bucks. I liked it right away but you really have to sleep on a pillow a few nights to see how it fares. After a a week trial, I decided that I liked it so I ordered more. After a months I'm still pleased. The pillow gives good support without being too firm. I fall asleep quickly and have no neck pain in the morning. Now that it is getting warmer, I especially appreciate that the gel fiber seems to stay cooler than a regular pillow. If I wake up hot, I flip over the pillow and it is noticeably cooler than my old pillows. I've spent a lot more on pillows that I did not like as well. I recommend these for every bed, esp at Amazon's bargain price!"
3,"Great locks, BUT color received is RANDOM","Five stars for these locks, colors are great and they help to identify luggage at baggage claim and the numbers on the dial are large and easy to see. However, the color of the pair of locks received is random (green, orange, pink or purple). Would order more if I knew what color was going to be shipped. These locks have a plastic body and are slightly larger than the standard metal TSA Master Locks.Master Lock 4680DBLK TSA-Accepted Set-Your-Own Combination Lock, Black"
5,Worked Well,"The four locks I purchased made it from the US to China, on two in-country flights in China, and back home in one piece. Sturdy and light-weight."
2,Luggage Locks,We just purchased 2 packages of Master Locks. Three out of the four worked fine. The fourth was broken and would not work at all.
1,AMAZON SHOULD BAN THIS PRODUCT,"Recieved the locks but when i tried to set the combination on one of the locks it JUST DID NOT WORK .It has been the worst product i have bought so far, One out of two locks worked and the other one , well it was hell to get it to work.Returned the item within 2 hrs of getting it HUGE DISAAPOINTMENT.AMAZON SHOULD BAN THESE PRODUCTS IT IS A STAIN TO ITS IMAGE AND A CURSE TO BRAND LOYAL PEOPLE LIKE US who shop on amazon with full faith."
5,Good Locks for Travel,"Locks worked well. I used them through South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia and back to the US without any problem. Easier than carrying keys around which I tend to lose."
1,Crappy service!,Do not order these locks! No way to tell them what color you want. Wanted green and got pink and orange. Sent off for replacement and was able to tell them I wanted green only. Got one pack of the green ones and another set of pink! Sent them back for credit according to their directions and got credit for one set not two. Order at your own risk. I'm done with it.
1,"Rubbish --- Don't Bother -- Use a Rope Instead, Tie a Knot","Looks good, but worthless. One of the locks is still sitting on my deskbecause as I was creating the code it locked up and TADAA, It set the code. My fault. :( ?Pretty Colors!"
5,Easy to Spot Neon Color and Safe Too!,I bought these from Amazon and got the neon pink. My bags are easy to spot in baggage claim. I carry valuable hunting sales samples when I travel and my bags are always checked by TSA (note in bag) but the locks are in place.Very safe.Every AIR traveler should have these TSA APPROVED locks.
3,Stuck on bell tower sniping,"Fun experience with these two games, the original and the expansion. Until I got to the bell tower sniping at Foy, in the expansion. I can't get past this and wish the developers had put in multiple ways to accomplish the mission. Any game I get stuck on, that doesn't give me enough options to complete, gets penalized in my rating, what good is a game I can't play or finish?"
5,Color Pictures Make the Book,"In this book author Shirley Dunbar shares with the reader her research on glassware produced by the A.H. Heisey Company, from 1896-1924.This book contains page after page of large, full color pictures of the different pieces. This is always joy to have as it makes identifying your piece so much easier. You can also find the market value of each piece which is another great plus.We are given a history of the Heisey Company and its founder and helpful tips for buying and caring for glassware.A well researched book that every collector would want in their library.Shirley Johnson"
5,the first is always best,"the first season of shows are the best, because everyone tries to put out there best product and get 'picked up'"
1,totally implausible storys and events partially annyoing characters,"The title says all I have to say...I was looking forward to this series, but stopped waching after the second DVD."
5,The Best of the Best,"This series is without a doubt the (not one of the) best series I have seen lately. It has action without depending on violance, it has excelent acting and it holds my attention for the full hour long. The characters all get along, well except some time Eliot get a little frustrated with Parker. I was saddened to see the show canceled. Please let me know if Leverage is picked up by another station."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"One of the best show to be on television. Never should have been cancelled. Great story lines, acting, and chemistry between characters is great."
3,somewhat of a muddle,"Plains Song is overall a sound novel, but suffers from some structural problems. It is as if Morris could not figure out the overall trajectory of the plot? Who are the central characters of the novel, and what is the overall conflict to be resolved? There are muddled intentions here, and it shows throughout this work. But overall, Wright is a master at detailing life on the Midwestern plains and the pivotal changes encountered by its inhabitants at the turn of the century. This redeems the novel somewhat, and makes it, if not anything, an interesting artifact."
2,Disappointed,"This book is not very thorough. I was disappointed at the information, I found the other books I ordered to be much more comprehensive!"
3,o.k,"this book was worth my 7 dollars but i wouldnt have paid more. o.k, the characters were very trifling"
3,You write simple and direct. It's hard to put the book down,I went to my doctor's appt. today and took your book with me. The doctor loved your smile on the jacket and said you should put your face on the front of your books. I feel that I can relate to most of the female characters in your book which makes it realistic for me and good reading.
3,"Light, fun, reading for the summer","Babysister will have you fussing, yelling laughing and thinking oh you poor thing. She is evil, she is spoiled but I am sure she knows better and at times she has a conscious. Now Darren is just pathetic. Malcolm has some serious issues he needs to work throught. These are just a few of the characters that make up Please Please Please. I thought this book was fun to read. I think as a first time novelist the author did a good job."
2,A good beginning with room to grow as an author,A good beginning for a first time writer. With room to grow there's much potential for further talent development.
4,Great Book,"I was very surprised that I really enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. This books moves along at an exciting rate and will catch your attention right from the beginning.All families have secrets, but what this family will do to protect theirs will shock you.Good read."
4,A Good Book for Beginners.,This is a good book for beginners who wants to grasp the basics of Oracle Financials. It would have been better if areas like Multi-org and EDI were discussed in more details. Discussion on Procurement Cards could have been strengthened.
1,Full of errors,"I was surprised, if not shocked by the number of errors I found in the book. Some of them seemed like poor editing -- for instance the mention of three authors when we know of only two. Some errors, however, were very serious since they inaccurately described the way Oracle Financials modules work.I am not certain who did the technical editing of the book but they obviously knew nothing about Oracle Applications. There were too many fundamental mistakes to blame the problem on an oversight.I would recommend the book to anyone who is trying to get an overview of Oracle Financials but would not rely on any information contained in the book in a real implementation."
2,Good book with wrong name,"If this book is called ""Oracle Financials Overview"" it would be an excelent one. But there is no way in hell this is a ""handbook"" because there is nothing inside to make you use this book more than once. It is good just to give you an overview (but good one indeed). And what ""planning and implementation"" (from the book title) are you talking about? Again, this is an Overview and nothing else!"
4,Murder mystery and horse-carriage world in interesting combination.,"There's a lot to learn about horse-carriage driving, the competition and love of the sport. All that and a cast of super active characters. Keep your eye on that fifth wheel."
5,What A Shine,"I just got my beautiful Crystal Star Pendant,I think it is beautiful, I am so glad I got it.It costs more then the other pieces. I think who ever gets thiswill love it. The Lt Blue Crystals really shine. So do the Lt.blue roseary beads. I have to tell you my husband loved this piece also. Now that I got one I am thinking of getting one for my son's wife.Thank you Paris and thank you Amazon.com"
5,A complete course under one cover,"3D Animation: From Models To Movies is a complete introduction to the creation of professional quality computer generated animation imaging. Key features included comprehensive coverage of fundamental 3D graphics required for animation; exercises to develop and hone computer animation skills; detailed tutorials for cover modeling, texturing, rendering, lighting, animation, and special effects; a color gallery displaying the work of talented students and artists; and an informative survey of cross-platform issues with explanations of how to apply animation techniques to a variety of software applications. 3D Animation is a complete course under one cover, and it's accompanying CD runs on either Windows or Mac, features a demo version of Maxon's Cinema 4D XLv6, a complete version of Strata 3D; all book images in full color, and tutorial support files."
3,no subtitles,"I am a fan of the show but was very disappointed to discover that the subtitle feature was not available. I often watch TV late at night and don't like to have the volume very loud, as I don't live alone. The subtitle feature has been a blessing for me when watching movies and other TV shows on DVD. I didn't start my Highlander collection until Season 5 was released, so I am not very optimistic that the other season sets are going to be different. I will still get all 6 seasons but are not going to rave about them. I also didn't like the packaging. Who wants to have to remove one disc to get to another? I will probably have to keep my Highlander DVDs in a CD wallet to make it more convenient."
4,Is there an audio book version available or coming out soon?,"I'm only a quarter in but it's obviously a very good self-help book for young african american adults. Some of my a-a friends are in dead-end jobs and are bored out of there skulls while at work, doing low paying, menial tasks. An (un)abridged audio CD/cass version of this book (read by the author esp.) would be just the ticket to bring my friends out of their doldrums (and perhaps out of their current work situations--if they work through the book's strategies and affirmations)! So...how 'bout doing the audio, girlfriend?Expect a more personal review when I finish reading the book..."
2,She continued to work at 26!,"I have to agree with other 1-3 stars reviews... I wanted to read a book by a person who retired at 26 with enough money or passive income to support her for the rest of her life.Contrary to other reviewers, I didn't like the first half of the book... it was like a memoir and pretty depressing... I paid full price for this book not to read a memoir, so I feel my money was wasted. I was expecting a kind of business book with how-tos, action plans, etc., and these didn't seem to be happening at page 100 or so, I almost gave up finishing the book.However, I liked the end half of the book much better. The book still doesn't give you step-by-step plans, etc. though, however, it has some good points and advices, e.g. excuse making... Boy, I've heard all excuse she mentioned in the book... and about decluttering our intimate space, serving whole humanity with our unique gifts, etc.Sorry, two stars for my money and time spent."
2,Effete's too big,"These flacccid disjecta membra would seem trivial in Reader's Digest, escapist in an in-flight magazine and fluff in any language"
2,Hard to work with,"This yarn has inconsistent quality. When making a project, I prefer a yarn with even thickness throughout the skein. In the future, I'll choose a different product."
4,Interesting history and some funny stories,"I must first admit that I am a bit biased (Violet is my great grandmother). Having said that, the book is good, not great. There are many stories throughout the book which do have an interesting historical perspective of things. Having lived through this entire century and having a better memory than most anyone I have ever known (she is still razor sharp on recalling events back when she was 4 or 5) she is able to talk vividly about how different situations affected the average American back in the twenties, the great depression, and many other events during this century. Give it a look if you see it in the book store. Definitely worth at least a curiosity glance."
1,Not worth Watching,"The opera was unknown to me prior to my decision to see it.Alas, it reminded me of a poorly produced, poorly acted, lacking of virtue high school play!No memorable songs, no great story line, no acting ability anywhere!ALAS, i simply can not reccomend it for any reason at all."
4,Technical details incorrect. Unit uses Candelabra Bulbs,Light kit is fine and works well on Hunter fan. Surprised to find it uses Candelabra bulbs since the description on Amazon stated that it uses stardard bulbs.
1,WARNING: wrong item,"WARNING: If you order this book, you are verylikely to get something completely unexpected.The ISBN-13 for the book is 978-1588801494.You are likely to get shipped the CD,Slum Village Fantastic Vol. 2,a CD with the EAN: 7-88581-01497-4.Note that most of the sellers' names have cluesthat they are primarily sellers of music CDs,DVDs, etc. -- not book dealers. Their feedbackhistory also has clues about what they sell.Sorry, this is not a review of the book, itself.But, I have yet to see the book."
2,Disappointed,"The first disc is a narrated history of Trent's beginnings and how he got to where he is today. A lot of good and interesting information, but it's delivered in a dull voice over that's obviously being ""read"" with only a few short snippets of Trent in actual interviews. The second disc is a compilation of mostly HORRIBLY recorded interviews. The quality jumps constantly from clean to more noise than voice. It also seems like they edited together snippets from different interviews to make complete sentences or thoughts sometimes. I love NIN but I'd have to say that you'd have to be a real fan starving for anything you could get your hands on about Trent to want to sit through either of these discs more than once."
1,Root Cause Analysis: A Tool for Total Quality Management,"I found this book to have very little practical information. A much better book for gleaning ideas that can be implemented is ""Root Cause Analysis: Simplified Tools and Techniques"" by Bjorn Andersen."
3,Arrived in perfect condition,"Arrived in perfect condition, but I paid for overnight and it took a week to get here. So I give it a 3."
4,For the beginner,"If you haven't read other self-help books, this is a good one. However, if you are pretty introspective and have delved into what makes you tick by reading other books, this one is rather basic. While the author shares good techniques and insights, they aren't new and I didn't care for many of the exercises. I also found some of the items she shared, such as poems she wrote, quotes she made, etc., a bit annoying for some reason. Too syrupy?I was disappointed in this book because I didn't find any lightning bolts that really made me think. It appeared to be a compilation of a lot of ideas that have been put out there many times."
3,Basic Guide for the San Juan,"This is a good guide for someone new to southern Utah and the San Juan River, but it offers very little for someone looking for more in-depth information. 75 pages are devoted to history, geology, mormons, etc., with only 12 covering the river. Again, if you're already familiar with the area, the first 75 pages are unnecessary. The final 12 pages are very easy to read, as compared to other guides, but very little information is given beyond the location of rapids. There is essentially no information concerning side trips (hikes, pictos, petros, ruins, camps...). Very bare-bones. I'm also alittle concerned with the thinness of the pages, and I wonder how it will stand up to getting wet."
1,A piece of junk,"I waited 3 weeks for this item. When it arrived, I removed it from the box. It is large and flimsy feeling. It needed a charge. I plugged the ac adapter into it, and the ac adapter recepticle inside of the headset fell right out! What a piece of garbage!"
2,early failure,"I purchased two of these nozzles, one split after a month; the other is still working fine. For the money, it's a decent product, but the female threaded bottom cracked in my hand as I was watering some shrubs, so from now on, I'll buy nozzles with metal handles only. Mark in NY"
1,Worthless!!!!,"I bought this item at a craft store. The middle portion of these are springs that you stretch up and let go which on impact is supposed to punch/set the eyelet & hole. To even punch the hole in regular copy paper it takes at least 4-5 times. Then to set the eyelet? Forget it. I still have to hammer it down because the edges stick up. I don't know if the punch sides aren't sharp enough or what, but it was not worth the purchase. Sorry..."
4,Good but Uneasy and Uncomfortable to watch if you have a younger sister...,"Well, when I bought this item I hadn't read the whole description. I only read a little bit and all I saw was 27 year old guy breaks up with girlfriend and falls in love with 15 year old, there's more to it then just that. It's basically an incest anime, he falls in love with his 15 year old FULL BLOODED sister and she falls in love with him, too. I have to say it was a bit uncomfortable for me to watch it seeing how I have a little sister who is 7 years younger than me. It's really uncomfortable especially the part where he sniffs her bra and then masturbates. But other then the whole incest taboo thing, this anime was alright. But, I advise anyone who has a younger sister not to watch it, or any sister at that, actually. If you do watch this and have a younger sister then I'm sure you can tell how this anime would make you feel. So for the romance and story I give this a 4 out of 5."
5,Greatest Book For ANYONE...,This is truly the best book for anyone who wants to be Jacked and be Impressive...Arnold Includes the pics of himself and many others for inspiration and visual Form. Arnold is truly the Bodybuilding Godfather and this book will guide you to the Body of your dreams!
5,Very good product,"This is the mother of all books or guides about body building. It covers everything you need to know about the subject. New developments, equipment, etc., have been made in the sport since the publication of the book, but it's still a great reference. If you apply its contents, you WILL get results."
5,informative and helpful,"It has it all in one place. With its 800+ pages, it covers all aspects of the sport, as well as being a great motivational material. If you want to know how to perform an exercise, how much protein should you take, what is ketosis or how to set your training for your body type - it is all inside.Of course you may not agree with everything it is written here. Personally, I don't use Arnold's approach (but HIT routines instead). Still, I like the book for being so extensive and informative."
5,Fitness Forever,"I came across this book when I was 14. At that time I started bodybuilding to strengthen my back which was effective. Some exercises do not require the aid of weights but just using my body weight was sufficient to progressively build and consolidate muscle groups. No matter if I workout at the gym, at home, holiday, or on business trip the exercises are effective. This is definitely a book to own and take action no matter if a beginner or have been working out for years."
4,everything you will ever need to know,"Forget the new diets, new exercises, uneducated personal trainers, just buy this book, and your have all the knowledge from diet, training, technique... just everything, even how to pose!Arnie was the best, and he has given all his knowledge to the world in this book. This book is indeed ""the bible"""
5,arnold is numero uno,This book is all you need for complete advice on training and nutrition. There's no need to buy monthly subscriptions of fitness magazines when this book provides more than enough information than the average person will need.
5,Serious bodybuilders only!,"History of the sport from the late 1800's to 1990's +. If you are a serious bodybuilder looking to tweak all the muscles of the body, get this volume. Loads of pictures, illustrations of anatomy, nutrition schedules, etc. As titled, it is an encyclopedia; as only Arnold can tell."
5,The Best Keeps Getting Better,"The new edition encludes all new photos of the modern bodybuilders, plus a nutrition section as well. The great thing about this book is that it covers every major aspect of bodybuilding from a beginners standpoint to a person who has been lifting for years. A must have for anyone who loves Arnold and wants to expand their knowledge about bodybuilding"
5,Arnold covers all the bases,"The first bodybuilding book I ever bought back in high school and it got me off to a great start. Arnold goes over just about eveything in what could be considered the ""Bible"" of bodybuilding. It's worth the money just for all the pictures but the information is great as well. Caution: the workouts are intense and could lead to overtraining, you have to remember that bodybuilders have special ""helpers"" that aid in recovery so listen to your body if it tells you to back off. But overall this book is great."
5,knowledge,From A to Z this book has absolutely everything that an individual needs in order to get the job done in the gym.
5,A Must-Have Book for Bodybuilders,I purchased the original book many years ago which helped tremendously and this new version is awesome. If you ever thought about entering a bodybuilding contest for the first time. Buy this book.
4,Good Reference guide,"This truly is an Encyclopedia that can be used not only by bodybuilders, but by anyone that wants to get involved with progressive resistance training. This can be a guide for the most experienced, to the novice who has never picked up a weight. Great reference for planning and maintaining an exercise program."
1,Never will do business with them again,"Jewelry Display Stand Blue DressI submitted a purchase order for this item last week and after several days received a cancellation stating that the item was ""out of stock."" When I checked the item it showed in stock. I could never recommend Bella Casa Boutique to anyone nor do future business with them. The $29 item might be worth $20 in shipping but I will never know..."
3,Simple and Good,"I will keep my review short,, it is good as long as you like Frida Singing Phil Collins songs, I would recommend this to hard core early to mid 80's Music Lovers that is why I bought it, to have on CD and quite a few of the songs are very good, but my guess is the people reading this already know about this and will buy it any way, so that is about that as it is not Great, it is not bad,, it is a good solid album ( I mean CD)"
3,Nice until the stones fell out,I am afraid to wear it now because I lost a stone and don't want to lose another! I think it is gorgeous though...
2,Doesn't stay together,"This was given to my 2 year old for his birthday and the pieces don't attach together tightly. It falls apart rather easily. So, we tend to pass on this toy and play with something else."
3,"Elegant writing, mushy content","Hood is a graceful writer, but her memoir is an example of self-indulgence and emotionalism posturing as spirituality. Her faith is based on the search for an emotional high, and has little to do with the traditional spiritual disciplines that are the staples of the spiritual life: prayer, meditation, silence, and scripture study. Read it for vivid descriptions of her expensive vacations, but not for spiritual inspiration."
4,18v Cordless Handheld Jet Engine,"Very powerful vacuum, easy to use, and easy to empty.Emptying this little beast can be done without getting your hands dirty. Although, to really clean off the filter, you'll have to get a little dusty.Yes, it is loud, but it's really not too much louder than a full-size upright vacuum."
1,Garbage in garbage out,This product sucks litter & dirt in fine.The only problem is it falls back out onto the floor as your taking it back out of the room.
5,Great Handheld Vac,We have tried many different models of handheld vacuums. The Black and Deck exceeds them all as far as power and performance. Has excellent vacuuming power and battery is strong for all those quick pick up jobs. Highly recommended.
