4,Very entertaining and funny movie,"My wife and I continually laughed as we watched this entertaining comedy about a couple of misfits who come up with a hare-brained scheme for robbing banks. But it works! What's funny is to watch how casually they approach the whole thing, having conversations about anything BUT robbery as they approach the next ""victim's"" house. The movie continually takes on new twists as their fame preceeds them, Terry keeps getting every symptom known to man (and some not!) and they suffer from the trials of having a faithful, if not too bright, getaway driver.Yes, the romance does get in the way occasionally. Yes, we figured out the final twist before it was revealed (but only by a couple of minutes). Yes, there are a few slow spots. But if you're just looking for a couple of hours of entertainment with good laughs, this is definitely a movie to see."
2,Mediocre at Best,"After reading all the glowing customer reviews for bandits (they must work for the movie studio) I felt compelled add my opinion. I would rate this movie as fair. Bandits wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good either. It has maybe five good laughs for which you're subjected to a great deal of implausible and boring filler. Wait for it to come to HBO. I bought into the hype and saw it early, big mistake."
4,"""BANITS"" IS SMART, FUNNY & CLEVER","""BANDITS"" COULD BE THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR BUT ""BANDITS"" HAS A MIXTURE OF ACTION AND COMEDY THAT DOSENT FIT. ITS LIKE YOUR SEEING TWO MOVIES OF TWO DIFFRENT KINDS. THE ROMANCE BETWEEN CATE GOING FOR BRUCE AND BILLY BOB IS STUPID I THOGHT PEARL HARBOR GOT ITS LEASON. NEVER THE LESS ITS FUN AND CLEVER JUST THAT BILLY BOB THORTON IS FUNNY CATE BLANCHETT IS CLEVER AND BRUCE IS SERIOUSLY MOVING GRADE- B+"
1,I WISH I COULD HAVE WALKED OUT ON IT TWICE!,"If you loved this movie, please, for the love of all that is holy, keep it to yourself."
2,Not all that useful,"For such a deep program like FileMaker Pro, this is a relatively thin book. What looks to be a QuickStart Guide is actually a QuickStart Project. The project is creating a mileage tracker...Not exactly something everyone needs. Why not lead us through something like a contact list, which everyone needs...I digress. This book has large pictures and an even larger typeface to get the novice FileMaker user their first project. Like most tutorials these days, it leads you through by the nose and doesn't really explain how this could apply to other projects..."
3,"Cinnamon, not clove","This is a good soap with a strong cinnamon aroma. I, and friends, agree there is no hint of clove scent. If you specifically want clove aroma, as I did, this is not it."
4,Nice selection of Cicero!,"This book is good for anyone needing a helpful omnibus of Cicero. It was refressing to feel his rhetic, and see the similarities between his day and our day."
4,A powerful quick read,"I was moved from tears to outright laughter in the span of four hours. The author, Luther Nussbaum, does an outstanding job of bringing you into his thoughts, fears and emotions as his world collides head-on with his worst nightmare. I was drawn into this very personal story and found myself thinking Luther's thoughts and feeling his pain. The Nussbaum family's love and their enduring passion to embrace events with realism and deep compassion sprinkled with a dose of humor made me want to preach the power of the human spirit.I highly recommend buying this book. Get it into your bookclub or just hand a copy to a friend. This book has both ""Oprah"" appeal and enough detail that you will learn a tremendous amount about the realities of working with individuals who have fallen into a coma.Many kudos to the author who, with his family and friends, reminds us what it means to be truly blessed."
3,major misstep,"Any director will tell you: casting is 95 percent of a picture's success. And that's where this film fails: everyone is perfectly cast, but for the two most important roles: Sean Connery can never play frumpy, and Michelle Pfeiffer, while not as glaringly miscast, also is a poor choice.Apart from that ..."
4,Russia House,Have probably seen this movie 4 times and enjoy it immensely. I also really like the background music. Would recommend it highly.
4,I like john lecarre,Well. ActedMore. Words and phrases and then I have 18 enough to be able to make the quotation. Now
5,Alaskan dream romance,"This book was a thrilling ride all the way from Fairbanks to Barrow. I loved Kay Westmore. What a wonderfully developed character with guts, determination and charisma. She has a soft side too. Lela, Kay's love interest, is dignified and proud. The portrayal of her rich cultural heritage as a native Alaskan is fascinating. The descriptions of Alaska are beautiful and the story well scripted and exciting as the adventure unfolds. There ia a real connection between the main characters -- Kay, Lela, Steff, Russ and Grace. Grace, Kay's boss, is a real hoot and Russ, Kay's colleague, is a riot. He has some great lines. And that stuffy oil company PR guy is also comic-relief. Young has a dry sense of humor that you learn to appreciate. And Kay's growing love for Lela is wonderful and unfolds nicely. It doesn't happen overnight but happens in a more meaningful way I could really identify with. Read this book!"
3,Ogre Slayer 2 at SheVa Con,I watched this in a Anime Room at SheVa Con and i give it an ok rating...probably be better in subs but most Anime are.
5,superb overview !,"I cannot understand why this band is so underrated (?) in USA. In Europe Supertramp still is very famous and popular. This CD is a good overview for someone who wants to get Supertramp to know. For hardcore-fans there might misses somes pieces (""Hide In Your Shell"") but nevertheless this anthology gives an excellent view for the unique talent of the band. Listen to ""The Logical Song""; ""Goodbye Stranger""; ""Rudy"" or ""School"" and you know what I mean."
3,footprints... ew,"Warning: it looks cool but you might end up with gross footprints on it because it's clear glass.I like the WW scales because they tend to be better calibrated than other scales. That said, this, like most others has some problems.The biggest issue is that if you move it from room to room or go from one place to another and weight yourself it will give you a different reading. Every scale I've ever had has done this. I still don't know why.If you keep it in the same place and weight yourself right there you'll get an accurate picture of where you are on your weight-loss journey."
5,Easy to use,I bought this scale for my mother and it has helped her and her grand kids to lose weight. It is easy to use and precise.
4,Sharp and Clean Design!,Prompt delivery and good service!Simple but sharp design of this product. Useful modes for kg and lb.
5,An Excellent Interpretation of Americas Two Pastimes,"Baseball and Sex. Two Pastimes that have been present in America since the 1800's. Well sex went back even further than that. Anyway, this adaptation of the life of minor league baseball players and a woman who is drawn to rookies is both funny and in alot of ways true. You don't have to be a big baseball fan to love this movie as the comic wit of Costner, Sarandon, and Robbins will keep you hooked. Also, the storyline is very interesting. Most definitely a video that is worth repeated viewings."
3,A classic that actually hasn't aged so well,"A lot of what seemed so supreme and quirky about this movie now looks common place. Is that because it's been imitated a lot? Maybe partially. But there's also Shelton's showy screenwriting and habit of falling into cliche. And Sarandon's character, although the actress tries hard to fight it, is simply Shelton's wet dream. In the end, instead of being strong, she is Crash's very willing love slave.Still worth it for Costner, Tim Robbins, and Robert Wuhl. And some great, hilarious, sad scenes."
3,Better than most of napoli's books.,"This was a very easy read. Instead of interpreting the story of Hansel and Gretel, Napoli rewrote it. the authur had interresting ideas, but they didn't ring true for me."
2,Respectfully Disagreeing,"I was disappointed after reading through this book. I think my main frustration is the author's use of labels throughout. Of course labels simplify, but I was hoping for a more compassionate and complex look into the struggles of all the people involved with Borderline Personality Disorder... instead this tends to reduce everyone to either an ""Ozzie"" (someone in a relationship with a person who has been diagnosed with BPD) or a ""BPD."" And that, to me, seems to be ""splitting"" the population in half - and the us vs. them is symptomatic of a larger attitude problem.People who have been abused by those suffering from severe BPD need trusted friends, a safe place, courage, and truth about themselves and others that will set them free. If you find yourself in this difficult place, pursue your own health and the health of those you love, but do not get this book."
2,Woman is the source of all evil,"This movie is like a mirror for a muslim society. All men in it are purely saints - sincere,loving, honest, clever, and only women are the real cause for all trouble possible.There is simply no woman in this film who is not a liar, a cheater, disloyal and dishonest. It's only a man that can sincerely put his hand on the Quran and take an oath, but not a woman because of her ""treacherous"" nature.She is a defective and inferior being. It's no surprise that this film was made in Iran."
1,not pleased,"this shocks does not fit a 2005 nissan frontier nismo off road, but they do fit the 2004 version!!! or at least the ones you sent me!!!but since i live in the dominican republic, it's to costly to send them back, so i sold them over here and ordered the ones i needed from a nother website."
2,yuck!,"Charlotte Hughes has some writing talent, but the plot and characters she created for this book have no redeeming qualities. If you're looking for shock or disgust, have at it, but don't expect to feel any sympathy or empathy. The characters just aren't worth it."
3,New ones differ from older models.,"Been buying these prep boards for years now and usually have been quite satisfied.However, over time, they are going to stain. Be aware that no amount of soaking, dishwashing, washing by hand, using every available recommended product on them is going to remove the stains. They will need to be replaced eventually. Also, they do get ruts in them over time from knife cuts. The biggest issue for me is that the small circles underneath used to be rubber and would stay on the counter while in use. Not anymore. Now they are plastic and do not adhere to any surface without using a damp towel underneath.Is it the end of the world? NO, but sure do wish that info had been stated prior to purchase. Sadly, this will be my last set because of that and also because there is just far too much plastic in use in the world today and now have begun to use bamboo cutting boards which are fantastic!"
5,Great cutting surface,"I have been using these Cusinart boards for years and perfer them over any wood or other man made surface. The big advantage is that they have curved edges which keeps liquids from spilling off the edge while you are cutting. I haven't seen any other cutting boards with this feature. Also, this material will not dull your knives. Sharp knifes will leave slight marks on the surface. The only reason I replaced mine after 5 years of heavy use. They clean up perfectly in the dishwasher. A very well designed product."
3,Technically great but difficult to digest,Good reference Book. Not an easy read. Binding was also very poor and fell apart on the boat in a very short time
5,The Girl Done Good AMY WINEHOUSE video,Amy Winehouse: The Girl Done Good is an indepth documentary on the vocal attributes of Amy's incredible talent. Highly recommended for any Amy WInehouse fan to compliment their Amy collection.
4,very happy with this,"it's a great price, it's great for storage.. it's rounded and soft and durable and I don't have to wonder if her fingers will get slammed or her bumping into it - it will last a long time."
2,Strolling Pain,"This product was okay for the price, but the handles are too low for average height or taller people. If you're pushing the stroller for any length of time, it gives you a pain in the back and shoulders."
3,Not bad,"I have received the stroller and it is quite nice. Much nicer, I think, than it appears in the picture. There is a good strong locking mechanism so it can't fold up on your child that you can press with your foot into place. The breaks work very well (one on each back wheel), but the tires themselves are so slick that the stroller can slide even on smooth surfaces - so be careful. The harness attaches on either side to the seat behind the child and between the legs. It is a basic inexpensive stroller so don't expect much. I do wish the wheels had more traction though. Because this is a safety issue I won't rate it more than a three, but otherwise it isn't shabby. The biggest problem that I have with it is that I'm 5'8"" and it is way to short for me. Please note that I was charged $7.75 for shipping for this when I purchased it here."
3,"A good deal, but not the best cable out there.","I understand a lot of people giving this a good review due to being a very good deal. As a deal this product sale rated a 5, it was fabulously cheap for what it is. As a PRODUCT, it's good. Works fine. But it isn't as sturdy as better cables, it's a bit flimsy honestly. If you are not going to be moving the cable around a lot, if you are just going to plug it in and leave it, it will hold up great! Go for it. If you are looking for a more resilient cable that can withstand many unpluggings and repluggings and being stepped on and so on, this cable won't do for you at all. This is more meant to be a stationary solution for when you need a nice long cable. I can't see it withstanding a lot of abuse though."
5,Stunning Quality for this BRILLIANT Young Director,"Eugene Kotlyarenko's new film 0s and 1s marks a great achievement in film history. Never before has the format of a movie been completely from within a computer screen. By fluttering between the first white iMAC early 2000's designed Email, Chat and Music platforms Eugene weaves a complicated tale of a hopeless guy trying to find his stolen computer. A series of HILARIOUS mishaps and misunderstandings all framed within the organic cyber movements of you the viewer make for a watching relationship that you've never had with a film before. You come away from this film thinking that this may be the most AMBITIOUS, HUNGRY, TALENTED director out there now (and then I googled him and found out he was under 30 and was like WOOOAAHH!!) A MUST SEE for young directors, and seasoned film aficionados alike. I will definitely keep my eye out for all of Kotlyarenko's new work. A+++"
1,This product is worst one I ever brought,This product come with a washer that keep causing the leak. It works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak. Now I just leave it in my garage and can't return it or use it. very bad investment.
3,somewhat disappointed,"I was disappointed in this showerhead. It is very large and the water pressure was very poor. It is not what I expected with Pollenex, I returned it."
4,A good short story,This is a well written short story about a young man who goes duck hunting and finds romance. It is an easy and light read. Enjoyable.
3,Working off the Pounds,"This scale keeps within 2 pounds of the last weight, but is about 7 pounds less than the scale at my WW meetings. Okay for general weigh in, but not great."
4,Good scale,"Good scale, but under actual weight by a few pounds. But I have found that it is consistant, so you can still track your weight loss with accuracy. Not bad for the price."
2,ERR,"The scale part itself is great, but ... if you don't step on it correctly, your body fat reads ERR. I still, after 3 months, haven't figured out how to position my feet for it to read my body fat ... the main reason I got the scale."
4,I love this book!,I have been a fan of slam poetry for years and I was so excited to get this book. It is so profound and beautifully written; you will find yourself slamming along with the poets in this book. It is very powerful.
4,Amazing photographer.,Steve Bloom captures our fellow creatures in ways that enhance a spiritual bond between us. His pictures show us wild yet somehow knowable beings.
5,This Edgar is wonderful and magical.,My book club members loved this story about Edgar Allan Poe and his love for Lenore. This is an outstanding story and the music is wonderful.
5,Up there with Harry Potter and Goosebumps!,My friends and I are doing book reports on Edgar Allan Poe and this audiobook of stories and poems is very helpful. Mr. Poe seemed to have a troubled and sad life but he wrote so many neat poems and scary stories. I have friends who write poems and draw. So a bunch of us can relate to Mr. Poes story.
5,My friends and I liked this Edgar A. Poe tape and the music.,This thing is really creepy and it makes you think. I like Stephen King and my friends like Charmed and Buffy. This is kinda like that. This is actually interesting stuff. The music is like techno stuff and classic music mixed. My friends and I think it adds to the story. Mr. Poe had some wild things going on inside his head.
5,MY DAD TAKES THIS!!,"My father swears by this product and says that he assists in controlling his weight and assists in his digestion. It also helps with his aches and pains. So, I found it here on Amazon, which is the type he likes because he likes the freeze dried capsules, which I have come to find out are rather difficult to come by......so another satisfied customer......thank you Amazon."
2,"pretty cheap, limited fun","I got these to play with at my desk at work in a call center. the magnets are pretty strong, but they're not as pose-able as I thought they would be. They were fun for a couple weeks, but now live in my drawer"
3,(MythTV) Buy a cheaper card,"My goal was to use the PVR-350's video and audio output port to display directly on my TV (for a MythTV box). The general consensus on the Myth mailing list was that this is isn't a very well-supported feature. It works for watching and recording tv, but the IVTV X Driver didn't work, so I couldn't use mplayer or xine to play movies, etc. Also, it's not clear if this is going to be supported in future versions of myth.In the end, I grabbed a cheap Nvidia card (with s-video) and ran the audio through my computer speakers. I still use the PVR-350 for getting the tv signal and recording it. It works really well for this, but I think the PVR-150 can do the same thing and it's $45 cheaper. Which is more than the Nvidia card cost. :)So, if I had it to do over again, I'd probably just get the 150."
4,Works great with Windows Vista,"I have this card installed on a Windows Vista Ultimate system for over a week now and it has worked very well. For the installation, the latest driver(s) were automatically downloaded via Windows Update and installed. I checked and they matched the latest drivers from the Hauppauge web site.Windows Media Center automatically recognized the card (including the FM radio) and everything worked from there. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to a very slight hum that I am hear - but it really is minimal. I am working with Hauppauge support to see if we can resolve or even if it is an issue w/ my PC. I have had good support from Hauppauge!"
5,Smooth and Trouble Free,The item appeared new and the service was smooth and trouble free. This item is part of a huge project and was a gift; so I haven't heard anything about quality yet.
4,great TV card and easy to use software,"I use this card to record DIY channels and hockey games. The picture quality is pretty good. I used to have it on windows XP pro but now it's running on Media Center Edition. I still use the WinTV2000 sw... don't ask why :)If you plan to use WinTV2000 on MCE, make sure you disable Media Center Receiver Service. Otherwise, you'll get an error, ""Failed to create TV Window. hTV=0x3fa1f8 Err=8"". Your hex address might be different than mine.I hook up a VCR to convert VHS into digital as well.The only negative thing about this card is the picture gets super white when content is bright in a large area. Watching ice hockey would be an example since the ice is really white, the details such as the puck and players would get ""brighten"" up as well and blend into the ice. So to fix that, you have to lower the brightness and contrast but that would effect other viewings like movies and shows."
2,Could be better...,I bought this scale a year ago and am now looking for another one because this one no longer works. In the begining it was great and gave me readings very close to what I was getting at WW meetings. I have a 16 yr old son and he was getting the 10lb differences overnight on it and has complained since we got it. Now the little rubber things on the bottom that center it have started coming off and the scale refuses to zero. Or it zeros then refuses to weigh you! It's kind of silly that the rubber things are stacked instead of solid so you might loose one and not know it. Also they should be longer or sturdier so that the scale stays balanced.
1,Repeatably inaccurate!,"I have found that this scale will weigh exactly the same, to the 10th, multiple times in a row. Wait 10-15 minutes, weigh again and it can be over 2-3 pounds different! Again, over and over it will show the ""new"" weight exactly the same. Wait 10-15 minutes, weigh again and it will be off by another pound or two! You also cannot chose your goal. It sets it at 10% of your starting weight no matter what. This thing is pretty worthless. We are going to a beam scale."
2,Worked great.......for three days!,"Santa brought this for my son for xmas, it was his favorite ever gift but after only three days the graphics would not show on the tv, my son was devastated. We emailed memorex , thinking we may be able to replace the graphics card but after 3 weeks they mailed us back and basically told us there was nothing they could do as we live outside the 48 states, they offered no advice or remedy. My advice, give this karaoke machine and memorex a miss"
5,Will Change the Life of You and Your Son,"I was thouroughly impressed with the writing of this book. While being careful to not overstate the obvious, the authors were forward and truthful. I felt that their honesty and integrity as men were painted in the way they told their own stories.When I read this book, I had both of my sons in mind, and will read this with them one day. No hesitations.A big ""thank you"" to Fred and Mike."
4,Susie Porter saves this one from the bin,"I am not a huge fan of erotica and probably never will be. Still I have to admit if I ever become a convert this would probably be the culprit. Susie Porter's erotically charged performance is enough to make any man stand to attention. It is quite uncanny. The poetry is nothing ""life threatning"" but the performances are good and the plot is not hopeless. Great score by sling gun theory.I recommend it."
1,Dull,"A sad little film about murder, lust, and sex. I believe that the film wanted an erotic flavor to it, but naked people do not erotica make. A girl is apparently missing and her family hires a lesbian detective to find her. I don't think it mattered too much if the detective was a lesbian, but she falls for a self absorbed bi-sexcual married female professor, Kelly McGillis. The story revolves around finding where and if the girl was murdered. Kelly McGillis was so unattractive that I couldn't concentrate on the story. I'm straight, so I might have spent too much time thinking why the dectective, Susie Porter was attracted to Kelly McGillis and it could have ruined the film for me, but I came away wishing I had not wasted time on the film. I did manage to figure out the ending half way through so that was another bummer. I can't see why anyone would like this film. Kelly McGillis looked like Susie Porter's grandmother by the way."
4,unique,"I have never read a book like this. The changes in dialect from chapter to chapter really help you envision the characters' attitudes and moods. The plot is truly a woven tapestry - certain threads tying things together from story to story, yet each one different and important in its own way. The only reason I didn't give it that fifth star was my disappointment in the ending. Moore does a great job of slowly giving you more and more detail to the underlying theme of magic and mystery throughout the book, then he just drops it in the end. I would definitely recommend this to any reader looking for something different from the usual pop-culture fiction."
5,fantastic deal,Both of these pans are great. Before my sole piece of cast iron was a very small skillet. So this was a great addition. I'm not sure I need any other pieces after this.
5,Best way to cook,"Have just recently dicovered the wonders of cooking with cast iron, will never go back to teflon. Bought this set to go along with the large skillet I bought, 2 pans in one, cant go wrong. With proper care these pans will be around for many years after I'm gone."
5,GREAT cookware that you can easily make non-stick,"This is a GREAT and very useful cookware set. I also have a set of Le Creuset enameled cast iron cookware, which cost tons of money, but I love Lodge since it's so cheap but it's such as great quality. Ideally you use this for sautee or deep fry, since the iron cast allows high heat and good distribution of heat. Food tastes better compared to non stick pans, and it's definitely non toxic.It says pre-seasoned but you might need to re-season it to make it raelly non stick. Put a generous layer of vegetable shortening and stick it in the oven for a couple of hours, then leave it overnight to cool off, then rinse with hot water to clean. Don't rub too hard when cleaning so the coating won't wear off. Re-season as needed, usually after a few months of use. Food will slide easily and cleaning is also easy when you rinse with very hot water."
4,Good pot for moderate quantity stews and sauces,"Of course this pot and the accompanying lid are heavy for the volume of cooking they provide, but the preseasoning, which is very good, and heat retention qualities make it an excellent pot for cooking stews and sauces from start to finish, i.e., searing the meats, sauteing the vegetables and slow cooking to finish all in one vessel. I originally purchased this pot to use as a chicken fryer, but I find that it is not quite big enough for my purposes, unless you are prepared to cook in two or more batches. There only two of us in my household, but I'd still like to be able to cook more than 3 pieces at once. Still, I am happy with this pot and pan combination, and although the shipping packaging from Amazon was something less than inspiring, the pot arrived in great condition and ready to use."
5,Great Buy,This is the most fantastic buy. I didn't cook with cast iron before because I though it would be too difficult. This little powerhouse has allowed me to eliminate about 6 different pots and pans. It's wonderful. The Lodge cookbook is also extremely helpful!
4,Sort of a hybrid.,"I have decided to use cast iron for almost all my cooking, so I ordered up a few to fill in gaps in my kitchen pots and pans. This was smaller than I expected. The bottom is not as deep as it looks, although it is fine. It isn't quite a dutch oven, nor is it a frying pan. The top pan / lid is really nice as a shallow curved sided pan, however you give up the self-basting top to get a second pan. The finish was really quite good. I would have liked to see this one before I purchased it, I may have opted for another pan. But I still like and use it."
5,Best cast iron skillet I've found yet,"I have been a long time lover of non stick cookware, but over the past year with all the new ""bad"" things coming out about them I decided to try a good ole' fashioned cast iron skillet. It was the best change! I try and buy only American made products and sometimes they are hard to find. This is not only made in the USA, but it works wonderfully and has made me a better cook! These are heavy and they are not for someone who has a weak wrist, but cooking on them is wonderful and so simple and the clean up is WAY easier than on any non stick pot or pan I've ever used. I love the fact you have a skillet and cooker all in one. Truly, this is one of the very best investments I've ever made and it wasn't even a big one. I cannot recommend this enough. I'm ordering a larger one to accomodate bigger meals. We are a family of 3 and this one sometimes is a little too small, but it still works great."
3,I just bought mine 2 weeks ago,"It looks discolored and as if its painted and the paint it coming off when I clean it or cook. If I wanted some China junk I would have bought some!I normally love this company and LOVE cast iron cooking. I just cant believe how much America has changed and how sad it is, we are stuck with this made out side of good old USA because its cheaper else where. Yet I paid about the same maybe 10 dollars more for my old set and it lasted yrs tell it fell and broke."
3,"heavy, but does the job","This pan, as I expected being cast iron, is not for the weak limbed. Oof, heavy! But so far, so good. I bought to use at work to make lunches on my induction range, since stainless steel pans are pricey and that or cast iron is the only option that works with induction via magnetic properties of those two metals. The pan transmits heat fabulously - be careful as it can get too hot and overcook your food if you don't set your heat right! and I would still recommend putting a bit of oil in with your food so that it does burn until you learn the complete range of temperature. Nothing sticks, but you can easily wind up with some nice brown welts on your veggies from the quick sear. Easy to clean and I don't have to worry about scratching it either, which is an added bonus in an office with 5 other boys who don't know how to cook that will likely be using. Great pan for the value"
1,Rusty and useless,"I bought this set having read all these wonderful reviews. In my teen years I was dealing with cast-iron a lot, that's was what my family cooked with, so I'm not new to this. However, the food started sticking to the bottom of the pans from the very beginning, even with oil, and after two uses both pans got ugly rust all over them. The handles on both sides are different in shape and holding angle, with makes it hard to handle this heavy pan. To crown it all, the handles are hot (I know that's how thew cast-iron supposed to be, that's a remark for those who are new to cast-iron cookware), and the more shallow pan is quite impractical in terms of using it as a cover for the deeper one. My overall impression is that using these pans has been the worst cooking experience in my life."
5,A must have!,"Bought this pot for my college grand daughter to make no-knead bread, knowing she did not need a real expensive Dutch oven I decided on this Lodge.I wanted to try it out first; boy was I in for a shock worked out as well as my Le Creuset Dutch oven with no worries about ruining my LC. And now I have 3 pots in one YES I decided to keep it for myself-not to worry though I bought my sweet grand daughter another.I use this lodge for everything and it does take such a wonderful beating...Great chicken fryer and Dutch oven. I use lid turned upside down to warm tortillas-and to fry a steak/hamburgers.So easy to clean I don't use soap just wipe down clean, and I then coat with a thin layer of veggie oil to keep it seasoned.I was such a snob about my Le Creuset cookware Well I guess an Old Dog can learn new tricks. Tehe TeheLodge Logic 5-Quart Double Dutch Oven and Casserole with Skillet Cover"
5,Hubbys Favorite Gift,I purchased this for my husband and he is thrilled with this gift. He has already been using both pans and the cookbook!
5,Lodge logic combo cooker,"The item is very heavy, you will need good wrist strength to lift it with one hand.Apart from that its very high quality and i recommend using pig fat to condition it further."
3,Depression and it's effect on the creativity of Samuel Becke,"The poison in Beckett's pen may stem from an unending battle with depresion. Fueled by the heinous occurences he may have witnessed or been told of in his period of living in Europe, he descibes the seemingly endless pain of plodding through life with the weight of depression gradually ebbing away his desire for life. The constant inability to find joy in any of the fragments of life in his timeless prison of daily existence manifests itself in the grotesque situations he helps us invision and the apparent absurdity in trying to believe that any of life can substantiate one's existence. Sounds like major depression to me and goes right along with his abuse of alcohol and probable low levels of serotonin."
1,Very Disapointing,"I just finished watching this dvd. I only rented it, because Robert Pattinson is in it.Robert was only on there for about the first 5 minutes. I rented this from red box and I thought that this would be a good movie. I wouldn't consider this a movie. It is a bunch of short stories. None of them have anything to do with the other. I definately would not waste my money buying this movie. If you have to watch it, then I would recomend renting it and I would rent it from red box, so it would only cost $1.00 Just by watching the previews that are on this dvd, I don't think that I will rent anymore dvds that are produced by phase 4 films. Overall, I would give this zero stars, but you have to put atleast one."
1,What a Freakin' Stinker!,"I bought this because RPatz was in it ( for about 1 minute half hidden by the shadows)! The movies annoying format ( a series of what I think ""educated"" people (I'm not one of them) call vignettes or scenes or stories within a story. The only story worth watching was the one with James Franco. Don't waste your time or the electricity bill on this movie! I just want to know who puts up the money for crap like this, so I can ask them to send me some!"
4,Love & Distrust DVD,"The movie was okay. I would of liked to seen more of each story, but I guess that would have been impossible."
1,Not worth watching,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The stories were boring and very disjointed. What a waste of time! If you don't believe all the one star reviews here, go check them out at Netflix."
1,Love & Disgust,"This is without a doubt the worst movie of 2010 and is a high contender for worst movie of the last decade. My boyfriend and I tortured ourselves with this film and kept our fingers crossed that the stories would all come together at the end. Well, they didn't. It is poorly edited, confusing and just plain stupid. Please don't waste your time or money. We got this movie out of the RedBox and I'm thinking about not returning it. No one should have to go through what we went through. I would have much rather watched my daughter's movie selection, ""Barbie in A Fashion Fairytale."" At least her movie had a plot!I don't ever comment on movies, good or bad, but this is one of those special situations where I feel the need to perform a public service and warn others. DO NOT RENT, BUY OR IN ANY WAY SUPPORT THE VIEWING OF THIS FILM!One more thing... Amazon requires you to choose a rating when you fill out one of these things. I wanted to give this film a big, fat ZERO, but they won't let me!"
1,A Waste of Money (and talent),"If you're looking for a Rob Pattinson flick, don't bother with this one. If you _need_ to see it, go rent it -- and be prepared to want your money back.Despite all the hype about it ""starring"" Rob, he shows up for about a minute. His performance in that minute is, as usual, superb, but it's a total waste of his talent and his time. The ""movie"" is actually five completely unrelated segments (each with it's own credits at the end), the best one actually being the one with James Franco. The last one (with Robert Downy, Jr, who stands by his car asking various women to ride with him -- and that's all) makes no sense at all, as it is in itself simply a bunch of unrelated scenes all jumbled together.This is the most disappointing ""movie"" I've ever seen."
1,Love & Distrust,"I was expecting a movie to watch not clips from different titles. If I would have know that this was not going to be a movie to watch, I wouldn't have bought it. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,Hope somebody made some money on this junk...,"This movie is a waste of time, a waste of money and a waste of, usually, good actor's talents. I do not recommend buying, renting or anything else with this one."
2,so - so,"Not overly impressed. I can't change the names of the main components (i.e. TV,Cable... ) I would like to have changed the names to work for the systems I have, which ended up being a moot point since the remote does not seem to interact with Wii systems (and lets be honest, if I had known that upfront I wouldn't have purchased this). From what I can see it doesn't do a whole lot more then what every other universal remote on the market does. Now before someone tells me that I need to ""learn the remote"" I have read all the documentation provided, and when I tried to log onto the Universal Remote website, every PDF link for this remote was down, plus 75% of the suggestions when I searched on RF20 where just pages that told you how to buy one - so I didn't find a lot of help there either. Just my two cents. Now if you have a PS or Xbox, this remote seems to work for those."
2,universal rf 20 review,"I still have my remotes lined up on the coffee table after buying this ""universal"" remote. I was able to progarm most of the buttons, but it just wouldn't work for particular buttons on my Comcast digital remote. The up/down buttons and for some weird reason the number five for example. Tech support said I was doing it right, but to just ""keep trying."" Needless to say I'm now looking for another remote after having wasted my money on this one."
3,Prefer MX-500 and URC-200,"I have used the URC MX-500 for ten years and it still works great, but the backlight broke a couple of years ago. So, I replaced it with the RF20, which is similar to the MX-500. What I don't like on the RF20 is the lack of the high quality ""gemstone"" buttons, which seem to last forever. The rubberized buttons of the RF20 started losing their labels and rubbed off on the edges, by the second year. Now the most used buttons no longer work well. In addition, the backlighting is only serviceable. The MX-500 is still available and remains excellent. Prefer that by far. The URC-200 is very, very similar to the RF20, but has the ""gemstone"" buttons and vastly superior backlighting. Find one of these discontinued excellent URC-200's on EBAY or elsewhere, if you can. Otherwise, the RF20 is fine. Just plan on replacing it as needed in a few years."
3,Not up to date,"Got the remote to control the blue ray player from the bedroom. No Blue ray codes in the manual. After going to the learn mode it will turn off on and ""push"" the volume control from the TV which did have a code. Tried to program my RF fireplace but discovered it cannot learn RF. Also none of the codes worked for my Directv which I have in RF mode. I'm going to return it."
2,URC-200 is a better choice!,"This remote is a huge disappointment after using the URC-200 (the previous version from Universal Remote Control). The physical features that made the URC-200 one of the best remotes ever are gone. The RF-20 works pretty much the same in operation as the URC-200 but it is more difficult to use because of the physical changes (e.g., the navigational pad's redesign is not as responsive and hard to use). The buttons are also not of as high quality and the overall awesome feel of the URC-200 is gone.I'd recommend getting the URC-200 or looking at Universal Remote Control's professional remote selection to get a design more like the URC-200. The RF-20 is a real let down."
4,Takes forever to program but works well,"The RF20 is a pretty good remote, but it's a killer to program, esp the Macros. No lie took me ALL DAY and 4 Calls to Technical Support to program the thing. I have to say,URC's Technical Support Dept. was VERY HELPFUL one of the best and got me through it though. The instruction book seems to have everything needed listed but for some reason I found it hard to follow and somewhat annoying to read.The remote's got a few quirks like it may take a few attempts to get it to learn from your other remotes, and having to come all the way out to square 1 to see if your learned commands took, but nothing I couldn't live with...Beats having 8 remotes on the coffee table. One thing though, my girlfriend hates the thing, feels its too complicated bouncing through the menus...so I guess this solves who controls the remote issue...LOL.Once programed works well,I'd recommend it's purchase."
1,worthless remote,"Never consistently worked. Needed to be reprogramed often. Only good for the tech savy, not good for the grandparents or babysitters!!! This remote spontaneously stopped working only after 6 months. Customer support informed me I have a defective remote, then suggested I go purchase a new one at my own expense. This was because they were backed up and it would take me a ""long time"" to recieve a replacement, purchasing a new one of their products would just ""be easier"". I opted to wait for the replacement, hopefully this one will work better. Customer support with this company is useless. I will never purchase another product from Universal Remote."
1,Worthless,"I bought this remote figuring that it would be the ultimate remote, but after messing with it for a whole day I put it back in the box and filed it away for another day. I went back on the web to look again for a better remote. I found the easiest remote to setup and use in the ""X10 remote"" It took less then 5 minutes to program, and it was up in running. The best part is that it only cost $41.00. All the programing codes are built in and it has a 2"" by 2"" color T.V. screen with all the T.V. Icons. so forget the other remotes and get this one. So DON'T BUY THIS REMOTE! ""BUY A X10 REMOTE INSTEAD"" You will be impressed."
5,"Well made product, highly recommend.","Fantastic remote.Pros: regular size buttons (for some reason, most universal remotes have very small buttons), very easy to use, low price and easy to program.Cons: none yet."
4,Works well as storage zipper is a problem,This is for storage not travel. If you don't manhandle it (I broke one pretty easily first time out) you can store 4 mens slacks and 2-3 jackets. THE ZIPPER IS THE PROBLEM HERE. Its on the side not the front and doesn't go all the way up. Theoretically the side zipper would afford you easier access to your clothing and allow you to pick an individual garment more easily than a front zipper. The fact that it doesn't go up all the way negates this advantage. (Does anyone test these things in real life circumstances?) The 3/4 zipper makes getting your garments out a chore and a pain. After buying a HONEY-CAN-DO storage bag with a front zipper (that goes all the way up and is a bit better for access to your clothing) and this one I'm beginning to think that I should get individual storage bags for my jackets. Basically for ease of access.
1,Beware of this Kindle edition of Odes (Modern Library Classics),The translation is Horace Odes is wonderful. It's just the problem with the kindle edition. After turning a few pages the Latin text and their English translation begin to mingle and mix together (e.g. first half of the same poem is Latin and then the second half is English Translation)! I think the publisher should fix the problem first!
4,Before Charlie's Angels there was Honey West,"It seems strange that the star of ""Forbidden Planet"" should be a TV star years later. The ""gadget"" private eye was new in the 60's: the miniaturizedradios, telephone bugs and TV cameras used in the show as props werealmost science fiction. The Martial arts in the show is pretty contrived by modern standards. Some of the plots have been recycled in other TV shows since as well. I regret that the show was in black and white as it seemed to have deserved color. The original Star Trek and the classic ""Prisoner""series are other 60's series that have held up with time. The beauty of Anne Francis in the title role gave the series some attraction as well."
3,Nothing beyond Nostalga,"Honey West is a product of its time. During the series initial airing almost 40 years ago, I can easily see how it became a classic cult series. But time has not be nice to the series. The production value definitely shows its age and some episodes are difficult to sit through."
2,Oldies but kinda goodies,Honey West was a syndicated Private Eye series that starred Anne Francis. Ms Francis was a real hottie in her day but her day is gone. The acting is rather stiff and corny to say the least. Mix that with the fact that this series was in black and white and you can see why it is not a series that I remember and I am 62 years old. If you are a person that enjoys old TV series perhaps you will like this set but I doubt it. I don't think that it is something that even a person in their 40s would sit through for long. A different time and a different audience (one who had never seen special affects and other technology) may have enjoyed the series.
2,Not worth the price.,The harness on this binocular is pretty good by the binos themselves are overpriced and hard to use. There are better Gen 1 night vision options than these.
2,Not what I expected,I wish I had known about generation 1 being the worst of the choices.....I would have gotten generation 2 or 3 which is a step up in quality.I don't even remember if they gave me that choice? Anyway I'm keeping them because their ok.
5,Perfect,"Daughtry is a perfect CD, with every single song having amazing hit potential. This is the only CD in my collection of 200+ where there isn't at least one song I want to skip. It covers all the bases - catchy top 40 rock, hard rock, and rock ballads. I'm very picky when it comes to rock music, but I love all 12 songs. I've allowed friends and coworkers to listen, and they're impressed. If you're on the fence, wondering whether or not to buy it, I can assure you this is one CD you'll love. I'd rate it a 10/5 if I could, but as it stands, this is a SOLID 5 stars!"
4,Good Debut,Good album not a great one but good I've seen Chris do better when he was in Cadence and the guitar player when he was in My dog Lucy
5,Excellent CD,This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard. I can truly say that I love every song.
5,Awesome,"I have to admit, this CD wasn't bad. I am a fan of Chris and even though it isn't as ""Rocky"" as most people would expect, it was great for his voice.You have to admit that Chris needed to do this album so he can start making a name on the radio. You can't say that not one rock band didn't ever make a bubble gum song in order to get onto the radio. Heck, even HINDER did it with ""Lips of an Angel""I would buy this CD for the quality and just the sheer lyrics of it all. If you don't think Chris can sing, then you will agree, he sure can write songs!Buy it, you will like at least a few songs to get your money's worth.Peace!"
2,very mediocre.,"I am shocked seeing all of these 5 star reviews. THIS CD IS VERY BORING. I wouldn't waste your money on it. It actually reminds me of The Real Thing by Bo Bice, except even more boring. Sounds like a Nickelback Clone."
5,"""MY"" American Idol!!","What a fantastic Cd! Daughtry is a superior vocalist and artist. He is definitely ""My American Idol"". Can't wait to hear more from him. #12 track on this CD is awesome and should be released as his next single. Just a beautiful song, period."
3,"Great voice, but mostly depressing songs","I am a big fan of American Idol and I love Chris' voice. When I bought this CD and listened to it, I thought the musical aspect of it was great. I only wish Chris didn't quite sing so many broken hearted songs. I hope he includes some happy love songs on his next CD...after all, I do believe he is still happily married!"
2,"Not trying to rain on anyone's parade, but..","I am just not that impressed with this CD. I was worried that he was becoming too one dimensional on American Idol, and unfortunately, that continues on his CD. The material does sound a little like Nickelback, but that's not exactly the problem. It's not a Nickelback or even a Live clone. The problem is that the riffs don't let loose enough and it's too slow and ballady to stand out. Nothing pulls at you like his version of ""I Walk The Line"" did. I don't know if Chris planned it this way or not, but to me, the edge is missing and it blends in. I like ""There And Back Again"" the most, where he can really show his rocker persona. He has a good voice (definitely better than the singers in Nickelback, Fuel, Creed, and Hinder,) so I hope he does better next time. If you disagree with this review, that's fine, but I'm entitled to my opinion."
2,"ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME, BLAND","I was so happy when chris one of my favoite idols released his cd. I was even more excited when I got the cd home. the problem is that even the best song which is the single It's Not Over are nothing to get excited about. the songs are dull with no life. chris I have to say tries to save this cd by singing his heart out. But that's not enough. I'm not giving up on Chris yet, I will wait till his next cd comes out and this time listen to the cd before I buy it. I very suprised that it was this bad, but I will try again."
3,A Bit Bland,"I was rooting for Chris all through the last American Idol. He has a great voice that works so well in the rock genre. The sound of his voice reminds me a lot of a Creed or a Nickelback.That being said, this album was a bit of a disappointment. The songs are just a bit on the boring side for me. They all kind of sound the same to the point where is just sounds like one continuous song. No song really stands out and commands you. I guess I expected more seeing as how he did not win AI and seeing as how that gave him more creative freedom with his style and with writing.I am not saying this album is horrible or anything, I just thought it would have more depth and a little more kick to it. There are a few good songs included on here but, nothing that really reaches out and grabs you like I know that he is capable of."
5,Awesome!,Been waiting for this one. It didn't disappoint. Daughtry is going to be the next Nickelback.
2,When will it end?,"I actually had somewhat high hopes for this album. Daughtry showcased his impressive vocal capabilities along with an appreciation for the classics on American Idol, so I thought his album might be a fusion of those two qualities. Wrong. The music on this album is utterly indistinguishable from the legions of other ""alternative"" artists on the radio today. Simple guitar riffs repeated over and over, yawn-inducing percussion, cookie-cutter song structure...when will this ""alternative"" wasteland finally be done away with? I anxiously await the day."
2,I miss that Absent Element sound,"Don't get me wrong - I love Chris Daughtry, and will continue to buy his CDs. But some of this was a little too ""generic"" sounding for me. There were only 4 songs I liked on the CD. I really miss the driving beats and individuality of the Absent Element sound from Chris' earlier days."
5,Daughtry Rules!,Thank God this man didn't win American Idol because then they would have had too much influence over his career. He obviously doesn't need it. This album is great! Taylor who?
3,daughtry,"great first album, but not as good as i anticipated. first single rocked, now we need something a little more original."
3,Decent Album,"I never watch Idol, but I kept up with Chris because he rocked. I saw this album and bought it spur of the moment. Chris has a great voice and it shows on this album. However, the songs are very pop-rock and the lyrics are unimaginative. Nothing makes this album unique and it grows tired very quickly. I hope Chris meets his potential and lays down a rocker next time."
4,Pretty good debut,"I thought Daughtry was the best of all the idols (not too hard) but forgot about him and just found the album. I agree with a lot of the reviews that this is pretty generic but I like it. You can compare the album to Nickelback but people always compare groups to other (see reviews on Creed and Days of the New). With some harder rock and a better band and writing, he can have a great album (Slash not withstanding). His voice brings the CD to almost 5 stars. I'm very surprised at how good this is with the little time he had after AI to put it together. It's probably a very good thing he didn't go to the finals or this would probably be another Bo Bice debut."
5,Fantastic!,I loved Chris's voice from the moment I heard it on American Idol. By far - he should have been the winner. His new album really showcases his voice. It is a great album; I love all the songs!
3,A 3 star CD.,"1 star for It's Not Over1 star for All These Lives1 star for BreakdownThe rest are mediocre. All of this has been done before, Cris Daughtry and Daughtry are just a mastermind's way of tricking the public. Buy a real rocker instead."
1,BORING!,"After hearing this album, if it weren't for the breaks between titles you would think it was all one long boring tune. although i don't watch ""Idol"" and didn't ever hear of this guy, i now know why. save your money, and buy something that has somebody with a little bit of talent.I think my ears are bleeding!"
4,"Good, but could be better","The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. That being said, I am still a little disappointed by the lack of ROCK songs that make Chris who he is. All the songs are well written (all but two by Chris) with great lyrics. This just further proves that Chris is not only a great singer; he is a talented song writer."
4,Around the World on A Thousand Dollars a Day,"Rogers made a bundle in Wall Street and then takes some time off to travel the world on a motorcycle with his girl friend. He starts in Ireland on 28 March 1990 and finishes in San Francisco on 31 August 1992, 65,067 miles later. This isn't just an around the world motorcycle journey but a look at the current state and future direction of world economies. If you have read Dave Barr's Riding the Edge, Barr goes around the world on a dollar a day while Rogers does it on a thousand dollars a day. He even buys a new bike for his girl friend in Japan to finish the trip because her old one wouldn't make it. Even though this isn't a ""how-to"" book it does give a little more advise then Barr's book."
2,Wrong Information,"This Item is listed with the cast as being that of the 1943 Technicolour Phantom with Claude Rains. IT IS NOT! This is a rather poor copy of the 1925 Lon Chaney version. PLEASE get your facts straight! I already own the Lon Chaney version, and I wanted the Rains. I mean, for pete's sake, you even got the DATE wrong!...for BOTH editions. Pay attention, please (lol)."
5,The Phantom of the Opera,"This is one of my favorite Universal Monster collections. The story is centered around the Paris Opera House.Claude Rains does a terrific job as the Phantom. Nelson Eddy is in fine voice as the male operatic star in love withChristine. Edgar Barrier plays Raoul the detective who competes for Christine's love. The color jumps out at you. Great music! A must have for any collection. And watch closely and see Hume Cronyn in this film, too."
2,BLAHHH,"For the very face that this movie is involved with the very idea of Phantom, I must rate it at least two stars, but other words I truely think that this movie is a waste of time and money. It does not tell you his real emotions except perhaps being a perverted old man who has a special likings for young women. Nothing was accurate to any story I've ever heard and compared his being with that of a sewer rat. The love story is absolutely awful, esspecially because of the fact that no one gets the girl, the one who was obsessed with her dies, and the two ""dashingly handsome"" men who competed for her affections, gave very little mind to the fact that she chose neither of them in the end. The best character was the violin!"
4,He's there . . . The Phantom of the Opera . . . .,"It was good , but I am still wateing for the one with Sarah Brightman and M. Crowford before I by it . Not long ago I asked someone , I don't recall who , if the one with Sarah Brightman would come out . They answerd by saying that It would be held of and hofely Premntley ! ! ! I should hope not ! I am thinking , why don't I just by bouth this one and the one with Sarah Brightman ( if hers comes out to home video!That is .) I like Sarah's better ! ! !"
5,Elegant,"These look great installed on cherry cabinets with a black countertop. Can't understand the pricing though. Only a limited number available at a promotional price, then the rest are available only at a price three times higher."
5,"The ""bible"" of groundwater","Despite the fact that this book was written almost twenty years ago, it is still considered the definitive work on groundwater geology. A must-have for hydrogeologists and groundwater engineers."
5,A long tradition survives,"Most scholars assumed long ago that the Taoist/Buddhist hermit tradition in China had died out with the coming of the Communist regime. Renowned author and scholar John Blofeld always lamented this loss in his numerous books on the subjects.Inspired by the ground breaking work of American Chan and Taoist author/scholar, Red Pine, ""Amongst White Clouds"" has given us solid film evidence that the hermit tradition is very much alive in China and had, in fact, never disappeared completely.It was wonderful to see that the profiled hermits also included a woman. Although the interview format is very basic, the spiritual nature of each recluse is readily perceived by the viewer.Any serious student of Chan and Taoist studies will find this documentary a sheer delight to watch."
2,BORING!,"This was an OK book. Definitely NOT a favorite of the throughbred series. I thought it was hokey and boring. I hated the end. Why did they have to turn it into a ""love story""? From the book: ""Samantha threw her arms around Tor and tilted back her head to receive Tor's deep, passionate kiss. His mouth was sure on hers, and Samantha could feel the loving warmth of his embrace coursing through her body."" Give me a break! OK, so maybe I'm not a love story fan."
5,It was great,This was one of Bentley's better books. It really focases on samantha and her past life. I really loved it:)
5,"awesome flavor, one of my top favorites","wow awesome flavor here, seasonal but i wish it weren't because i would buy them all the time. tastes so good, perfect with coffee or anything you want. great great great"
5,Foyle's War,I watched the entire series on the Kindle Fire. What I liked about it was that the acting was very good and it was an authentic view of life in England before and after WWII. The mysteries were well done but it was educational to see England during those days. I even enjoyed looking at the way houses were decorated and the way people adjusted to war and bombs falling. This entire series is well worth watching. Its just wonderful!!!
3,Be Extremely Careful,"I agree with the review of the person in San Jose, but the standards for passing my test were higher. I needed to score 500 or higher (they've also changed the way the test is scored, this would be equivalent to a 50 now). If that's the case for you, I highly recommend the Priceton review ""Cracking the CLEP"", and I'd also recommend you add a third review book. I sincerely feel that if I'd relied only on the Comex book, I would have failed the exam. Also, make use of the free guide available from CLEP. It has 50 test questions (much harder) that will give you a more accurate gauge of how you're doing. Until you can get at least 1/2 of those questions right, don't take the test!"
1,Dont buy this book!,This book is a joke. The practice tests include topics not even covered within the book. The illustrations are mediocre and largely irrelevant to the material. Did I mention this book hasn't been revised in years? It states theories that were disregarded years ago. I only wish I could get my money back.
2,Not enough information,"The information covered in the review book is not sufficient. This guide focuses on some areas that are not covered in the exam. The exam has areas that are not covered in this book. The book has a lot of information, but not enough to sufficiently study for the Natural Science CLEP exam."
2,Need more than just this book,"I studied from this book as well as the CLEP General Exam book for 4 weeks and still did not pass the test. Now I must wait 6 mths before retaking this subject, and I am now looking for another book to further educate me material that was in the actual clep test. The information covered in the review book is not sufficient. This guide focuses on some areas that are not covered in the exam. The exam has areas that are not covered in this book. The book has a lot of information, but not enough to sufficiently study for the Natural Science CLEP exam."
3,"A good starting point for the test, but plan a few more items","I used this book for the CLEP natural sciences exam. This book is a good starting point for your review, but it's not enough. I used this book as the primary resource, followed by the Official Study Guide 17th edition for review of test questions. I also bought Barron's Review Course Series, Let's Review Earth Science book for review. It covers a lot of stuff in more detail. Be prepared for the Biology and Chemistry portions of this test. I studied the CLEP guide I'm reviewing here and found the questions in the back to be pretty good, followed by testing myself with the CLEP Offical study guide and the Barron's book for thumbing through for review areas. I studied for 2 days, maybe 5 hours total and scored a 68 on this test. I hope that helps and good luck if you plan to take this test."
3,Best of southern rock,"The good news is you get 2 disks, the bad news is it is more country than rock. I really would not by it again because by the time listened to all the songs on it I took it out of the car and listen to other southern rock groups and went to my favorites. This was my fault because Amazon gives you a great way to preview all the songs both audio snips and number of songs and sound quality. I bought it because of the good reveiws that I usually go by that were all really good. I will trade or give it to someone who is more into country."
1,"why this repertoire, NOW?","It almost hurts to say anything negative about this magnificent tenor..this man who has succeeded in ANY repertoire..arguably the greatest tenor of his generation..But: Why Placido did you record this material now? As another reviewer aptly put it - some 20 years too late? These songs requre a fresh, young Italianate voice. At this point in his life, the great Placido Domingo does not meet any of these requirements. I can only conclude that Domingo was persuaded to record this material only to ""complete"" a career repertoire that includes Handel and Wagner, and everything in between! My advice: before you start to dislike these glorious love songs from this recording, find them done - the way they are supposed to be done - by the inimitable Giuseppe Distefano."
4,Makes good reading,"Somewhat self-righteous and pedantic at times, but highly pertinent on the whole. Actually makes very good reading. Mister Fiske seems to entertain a pet hate for foreign metaphors, French in particular, except when it suits him (portmanteau is coat-hanger in English).Would definitely recommends it as a teaching reference at university level.As a last word, Mister Fiske would do us a great favour by publishing all his works into one single book. References to other work(s) smacks of (concerted) mercantilism."
1,Not their best.....,"The first Fantomas cd was 30 tracks of brilliant insanity. this is merely background noise with a few good parts but they come too little too late. On the self titled, or ""book 1"" to some, i can close my eyes and envision a storyline to the tracks, on this cd i really don't know whats going on and don't really care. i've heard these noises before. there's very little actual music being played on here, and don't get me wrong i love Mike's solo albums and his work with Merzbow, but i expect ALOT more from Fantomas. I don't think i'll listen to this very much, if i ever do again.I'll have to agree with another reviewer in saying the best part of this recording is around the half hour mark, but before and after that, its really not worth the money i paid. it belongs in your collection if youre a fan of mike's work, but not many other people will really get this or even care to. Myself? I'm patiently awaiting Suspended Animation."
4,great pump,I have several of these pumps. I use them to pump the rain off my flat roof. The plastic parts need to be replaced after a year.
1,Big Waste of Money!,"In preparation for the A+ exam I had already purchased the Exam Prep and Exam Cram books and CD package. To give myself an extra ""edge"" I also bought this disk. It came with no instructins or documentation of any kind. The biggest disappointment was the questions. There was not ONE QUESTION that I didn't already have on the disk that came with the first package I had alreay been using. I can't believe that the people who offer these series had the nerve to market this disk separately."
3,Best Motivator Ever!!!!,"Every other day when i`m doing workouts it my room i eventually get tired then I look at Bruce Lee with the ""IF YOU GIVE UP I WILL HIT YOU WITH MY NUNCHUCKS"" or ""GET REVENGE WITH YOUR MUSCLES"" Angry expression.I`ve never had a better motvation to workout *Exaggeration*Still worth it."
3,Tin Tin Out tries to bring Tears4Fears into the millennium...but others have done better,"Call me Mellow is mixed by Tin Tin Out in an attempt to bring us that electro house feel, but it's not catchy enough, becoming a bit too repetitive after a while. For real magic, checkout ""Chosen Few vs. Tears for Fears,"" which features brilliant new mixes of ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World,"" or The single for ""closest thing to heaven."" The Solasso club mix really retains the tears for fears sound while giving us a hard, modern dance track."
2,Not great,"I was disappointed with this book, as it felt that I was reading a 17 year old's school project. Maybe one could argue that the opinions put forward were naive intentionally so as to give the impression that the characters were illinformed. I do not however feel that this is the case. I think that this is purely another blatant example of Mr. Elton standing upon his soapbox and smugly preaching his political beliefs to us. Save it for an editorial. I did give the book two stars as it was short. This was the biggest favour that Ben Elton could have possibly bestowed upon us."
2,No longer so good,"They changed the recipe or something, cause they no longer taste like white chocolate. :( It's an odd sweet, creamy taste that is definitely not like it was a few months ago when I got my previous shipments. The last batch I received through subscribe and save has an expire date in June 2012. It tastes awful.I called Clif and the customer support gave me some canned response of 'The taste can vary slightly from batch to batch'. Sent me some replacements and they tasted the same. Awful. I have canceled my subscription to this particular Clif bar( I still have 2 others). Really is a shame, this WAS a great flavor. What Clif did to it, I do not know. Again, these no longer have a distinct white chocolate taste, but rather some other sweet flavor I have yet to identify. At the end of the day, some may still like the taste I suppose, but the bars no longer taste like they did."
1,Lacks necessary serial number - lessons are unusable.,"As a reasonably knowledgeable person looking for some information to teach some middle-schoolers a little about game graphics, I purchased this book. This is a book for the person who wants to understand a little something about 3D graphics. The explanations in the first 2 chapters are easy to understand and I wanted to continue by working through some of the lessons, thinking I could use the program with my students. The program, gameSpace Light is readily available on the Internet and was also provided on the CD. After installing it, there is a link to register and get free serial number to make the program run. The only problem is that Caligari was sold to Microsoft and no longer supports gameSpace. I spent the better part of 2 days searching for a serial number.There is a link to the author's website. That doesn't work either. I give up!"
5,The Hand of God - The Hubble View,This excellent collection of pictures from space presents an awesome and inspiring view of space through many of the Hubble photos accompanied by pertinent and profound quotes from thinking peple.It is a marvelous and thought-provoking encounter with the heavens regardless of your religious views.I have given it to my children and friends and received 5-star responses from all who see it.
3,I blame the gargoyles,"I like this movie. Really I do. The music is incredible, as is the acting, as is the animation, as is Frollo.With all the potential it had I was just not satisfied. So I blame the gargoyles. They felt out of place in the movie and just seem to take up time the directors could used in other ways. I suppose they were supposed to represent Quasi's psyche, but I think they could have come up with a better idea. In fact, this could have been the first animated musical that was not geared towards children, they could have come up with something better, but Disney didn't take that step. So we got stuck with bickering, fast talking gargoyles as comic relief. It really is too bad."
3,Hunch Back,"Excellent movie, wonderful music. Grandchildren have thoroughly enjoyed this movie - very good message."
3,Not highly requested by my kids.,"Good Disney movie, but my family just didn't find it interesting enough to want to watch it over and over like most of the Disney movies we own. Our favorites are Dinosaur, Lilo & Stitch, Monsters,Inc, Toy Story...and we watch them often. This one tends to hit the back of the shelf before we decide to dig it out again.1smileycat :-)"
4,"A classic, Underrated Film","The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of the most underrated Disney films of all time. Never do you see any aspects of the film promoted in the disney parks alongside other classics like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. The film is very unique, and the music is beautiful. Definitely a great buy"
5,One of Disney's best,"*Minor Plot Spoilers*The beautiful outcast Esmerelda never withholds love from anyone, even the feared and deformed bell ringer Quasimodo. While the cruel Dom Frollo will stop at nothing in his witch hunt for every last gypsy in Paris, Quasimodo (among others) stop at nothing to hide and defend Esmerelda. I love this movie. It's an epic struggle of good and evil; of love and heroism. Based on the book by Victor Hugo, the story is incredible. The animation is gorgeous. And the music superb. 10/10 on every level."
1,Not too good.,"I saw this movie when I was maybe seven I suppose. It was downright disturbing. I mean they tie up Quasimodo, throw rotten fruit at him at him, they show Quasimodo's Mum being killed while trying to seek refuge in a chruch, we see the evil guy nearly drowning baby Quasimodo in a well, a house is set on fire with children inside, there is predjudice against gypsies, there is a song about Hell (I didn't fully comprehend the message they were trying to get accross at that part, I'm pretty certain it was Hell though), they nearly burn Esmeralda at the stake and a whole bunch of other really WEIRD stuff goes on. It's a big royal mess from beginning to end. I understand bad thing shappen in the world but this movie was intended for children and I don't recommend it for small children or anyone else for that matter. In a few short words, it creeped me out and I didn't see a point to it."
1,R rated cartoon... very violent....,They should warn parents with children before entering the theater... Hard to believe it comes from Disney....
1,Just too much of adult content,"I saw this when it first hit video and did NOT like it then. My husband since bought it, having never seen it, and assumed it was just another Disney film.Even the very premise of the movie is a horrible one for me. A mother gives up her infant for freedom and then ends up dead anyway. It paints religious leaders in a horrible light and then has this same leader lusting for the girl he wants dead!It's dark, and very anti-religious. If I want my children to know the history of religion. I'll tell them and NOT let a movie that is for entertainment do a very shoddy, one sided job!"
5,A breathtaking masterpiece,"""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is with-out-a-doubt one of Disney's best. The music itself will sweep you off your feet into a world previously unexplored by Disney, leaving you breathless. Not only is the music great, but the story is so well put to film that you may find yourself watching it over and over and over....For anyone who thinks that the movie may be too much for younger children to see, I say this: Disney makes movies that inspire kids to follow their dreams. Hunchback does just that. It disregards the sugar-coated custom of most children's movies, and shows kids that life sometimes deals out a hard hand to play. Quasi, like a lot of people in the world, isn't perfect. But in the end he over comes his personal struggles, showing great moral fiber that most disney characters may lack. I just dont why it is wrong to show kids that not all hero's are perfect - that following your dreams is not just the hero's right, but everyone's."
5,"the best ""how to"" book on being funny.",this book is very comprehensive and very logical. tons of information for writing comedy and being an outstanding stand up comic. everything about creating and performing comedy is here. this book is sensible compared with the other books which are just so-so.
5,More than just helpful,"I find the advice in this book not only practical but sage-like. Anything you want to know about how to do stand-up comedy for a living is in here. Of course, some would argue that you can't learn how to do stand-up comedy from a book, and they are right. But you can learn how to learn to do stand-up from a book and this is that book. She also gives guidelines about what not to do, you can ignore them, try them out and find out she was right, that is also part of the learning experience taught by this book.It is going to take me years to fully comprehend how accurate and useful this book is and I'm happy she wrote it."
5,Best welding book,This is the best book I know about welding. Mandatory for everyone who works or wants to know more about this subject.
5,Good-bye My Lady,"Great movie depicting the love shared between a boy and his dog. As always, Walter Brennon plays an excellent part as the boy's uncle and of how children should be raised and the shaping of a child's character."
3,"Not the best video for beginners, but...","Intermediates will reap benefits from this video, which helps expand the chest after a day of slouching forward. However, unless you have some previous experience with yoga, or unless you are relatively physically fit, Walden's routine on PM Yoga may leave you feeling a little sore in the morning. The pacing can be rather quick - especially during the more active vinyasas in the middle - so it would be best to view the tape at least once before trying the poses. Better yet, try out one of Walden's other videos, Yoga Journal's Yoga for Beginners, a gentler intro. to yoga, common poses and yoga props. Then you will be more prepared for pm yoga and the other ""for beginners"" videos in the Yoga Journal series."
4,Super Sexy Shoe,"I love this shoe - you won`t be disappointed! It is sturdy and comfortable, thanks to the platform in the front. Remember to order a half a size smaller than you normally wear though - I ordered the size 7, but because of the heel height, a 6.5 would have been much better. Other than that - a really nice shoe!"
2,"Dinner With Friends HBO Dvd ""New""?","The description of the movie was ""New"". Upon inspection of the product when I received it, it was obviously used. Smudges under the packaging, old stickers on corners that someone had tried to pull off when they first received the dvd. I would consider other sources before I would buy from this company."
5,Dinner with Friends,"I love this movie,,it is very real...and I love Dennis Quaids last line at the end of the movie.. This movie arrived really quickly and in excellent condition!"
5,Must have for Roxy Music fans,"Having seen the band a couple of months before this concert, I was very happy to find this concert recording. I was happier still when I saw and heard the DVD. Both the images and the sound are excellent. If you have a DTS home theater system, the sound is absolutely amazing. Of course none of this would matter if the performances were poor but here Roxy Music are splendid. The song selection is perfect and draws from all Roxy Music eras. Original members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzanera, Andy MacKay and Paul Thompson are joined by other top notch musicians including Chris Spedding. Highly recommended for any Roxy Music fan."
4,"When punks get the blues, this is the soundtrack...","Hard as hell to find but worth it.Cheater Slicks' cult classic 1991 blues-punk LP Destination Lonely has been OOP so damn long that you should resort to anything, without hesitation, if you see an attainable copy. This is a really memorable record filled with snide on-edge vocals backed by catchy garage music that is caked in alcoholic blues sorrow and accompanying Ramones-chug.And yeah there are some weak spots but, overall, it's a strong album that fans of the Blues Explosion's less experimental stuff will instantly love. Best songs are the frenzied ""Murder"", ""Hear What I Say"" and the sad closer ""Time & Again."" P.S. the CD cover art is way cool."
4,Easy Listening,Not huge into bluegrass but I like Brad Paisley. Sometimes you want to hear something soft.. Good Deal
2,informative but visually lacking,"When going over an encyclopedia, one of the main features you expect to have, next to each informative description of theweapon system is a visual overview, either in a drawn format orwith a picture colour or black and white, and this is where this book is lacking. Thoughthe book describes several weapons systems, it fails to deliveras there is too little in the way of visuals.Personally, I would steer those interested in modern militaryhardware into the direction of the Jane's Military books as theyoffer what this book lacks"
4,Action/Suspense,"If you have little faith in a corrupt system, this movie will do little to restore any rose-colored glasses view of things. Since I fall into that category, I enjoyed the story very much. Does the bad guy get his just desserts in the end? I like it when they do. Good story, good action, good all around in my humble opinion."
5,Satisfaction,I am completely satisfied with this purchase. I've only had it a month and I've watched it 3 times and lent it to 3 friends. Thank you.
5,Shooter,"This was one of the greatest action movie I seen in along time, and Mark Wahlberg did a great job in this movie. This is a must see movie."
5,Most Underrated Movie of '06,It's a crying shame more people didn't see this flick in the theaters. It is still one of my top 5 movies of the year. Who would have thought Markie Mark would turn into an acting powerhouse.
4,Lots of Action and Suspense,The action here is almost non-stop with a perfect cast. The story is good with an ending that ties up everything just right. Don't think too hard about the story (gunshot wound in the shoulder that's good as new in 2 days)just set back and enjoy the ride.
5,WATCH THIS SHOT,"SHOOTER (DVD).Shooter is based upon the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter. I enjoyed the novel some years ago; I enjoyed the movie last night.Gunnery sergeant Bob Lee Swagger( Mark Wahlberrg) is a sniper. He's been recruited by Spooks to a special mission that only he is good enough to do. He gathers up his trusty .50 caliber Barrett sniper rifle and takes a couple of practice shots, then agrees to do the mission. Of course since Spooks are involved he is set up for something that he didn't do, Spooks are notorious for weaving a web of deception and double crossing.The movie follows Swagger across the country making one outrageous shot after another. In the end Swagger pulls off a twist, gets the girl and saves the day. All in all a very satisfying movie.Gunner July, 2007"
1,Danny Glover RUINED this movie.,Danny Glover's lisp/slurring was so distracting I'd rather have been watching the Home Shopping Network.YUCK.
4,Fun ride,"This is a fun movie. It's a good shoot 'em up with a decent plot line. Acting is good from Wahlberg and Glover among the other leads. Compare this to movies like ""No Way Out"", ""Clear and Present Danger"" and ""Under Seige"". I doubt Oscars or Golden Globes will ever be won from this movie but it's an audience pleaser. Rent it and prepare to enjoy yourself!"
2,a mediocre screenplay with a mis-casting actor,"if compares to the original fascinating 'point of impact' by stephen hunter, this 'shooter' is a failure, not just the screenplay but also the hero casting. m.w,'s image is totally different from what we have visualized 'bob lee swagger' should be. even you didn't read the first 'swagger' series, you would not feel thrilled by the choice of m.w., because he's absolutely not 'swagger' should look like and act like. added up by a somewhat messy screenplay and other badly casting supporting roles, this movie is a far-cry from what we wish to be produced. i was kinda heart-broken when i found out that the great series was totally ruined by this mediocre movie and those hollywood stereotyped explosions. better check with the marines to see if they know how to get ready-made stuff from a hardware store to make pipe bombs so powerful. i seem to remember that 'point of impact' is a very lethal but also very quiet novel, where those explosions come from?"
4,2 Hour Film that had very few filler moments,"This movie reminded me of The Bourne films, in a way. Mark Wahlberg played a nearly indestructable ex-military man, who was the most amazing shot in the history of mankind. Very entertaining film, great action sequences, and like my headline suggests, non-stop 2-hour thrills. Highly recommended."
2,Not too good,"I thought that the action on this movie was fair but the story line was boring, slow developing and predictable."
3,The shooter has three names...there's a coincidence,"I thought this was a pretty good action movie. Michael Pena clearly saves this film from being a total waste of time with his mildy-eccentric role as a newbie federal agent. The plot is extremely unrealistic. Overall Shooter is worth a rental at least to see the magnificent display of firearms and explosions, because that's really all there is to it. Enjoy."
3,"Okay, but just okay","It can be fun to watch if you've never read the Stephen Hunter novel and can overlook some technical inaccuracies. Or, if you can just forget about the novel and watch the movie for itself.But for fans of the Bob Lee Swagger character created by Hunter the disappointment can be that Wahlberg's character is not the Bob Lee Swagger that Hunter created and wrote about in three novels- a retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant, Vietnam Veteran, and ol' squirrel hunter type from Blue Ah, Arkinsaw.Hunter's Bob Lee Swagger represents the quintessential Scotch-Irish type of rural Southerner from the nineteen-fortysomething era. Wahlberg's Bob Lee Swagger isn't that man."
3,Worth watching if you are bored,"This movie has a good storyline, the plot follows well. Unfortunately the acting by Danny Glover and Mark Wahlberg does not follow through. Mark Wahlberg was my favorite actor when he did Boogie Nights. I thought that was a fantastic performance. Unfortunately, when he plays tough guys roles, it doesn't follow through. It comes across as fake. He is better suited to playing roles like in Boogie Nights and not that of a professionally trained killer. Glover does a bad job of playing a bad guy. Really poor. It is a shame because he is very charismatic in Lethal Weapon.I thought the movie was really well done otherwise. The scene where he was trapped and surrounded by 24 mercenaries on all sides and closing in quickly was exciting. The story kept unfolding new angles and couldn't wait to see how it all ended. The special effects were good. Had they had more believable actors, I would have given this movie 5 stars."
2,Violent waste of time,"Since it only cost $1 to rent, how could I go wrong? Now that I've seen it I realize someone should have paid me to watch it. The answer to everything is just kill it."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"This is an extremely boring action movie. There are a few good action scenes but nothing you haven't seen before. Mark Wahlberg plays a sniper who shoots and kills people. Not exactly what you would call a sympathetic character. Wahlberg is set up by the Government to take the fall in an assassination. The problem is there is no character development and you simply don't care if Wahlberg's character lives or dies. The movie is devoid of drama and simply relies on the power of the action scenes to keep your attention; unfortunately, my attention was lost about a half hour into the movie. I give it another half hour then I gave it the gong."
4,Shooter (HD),"Plenty of twist and turns to keep you on edge! Good, suspenseful, action-oriented film. Danny Glover as a villain is interesting."
2,Where have I seen this before,"Familier plot, familier acting, familier ending. Not a single original thought in this movie! I like Mark Wahlberg - only reason why the movie gets more than one star.Aren't you tired, like I am, of a movie where a bad guy(s) are the corrupt/unethical/immoral/incompetant political/government forces?"
4,Solid,"I have watched this film about 4 times I think. It is rare that I watch any movie more than once. We have been inundated in our society with one man army/hero films(Batman,Superman and shloads of others). Yet this one stands out for me because it points to certain political truths. A good double feature would be this film paired with Bulworth. Start with Bulworth and then watch this one."
5,wonderful any time of the day,"Nature's Path Organic Corn Puffs Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)This is a simple cereal with no additives, very low on calories and full of flavor, especially having it with fruit. I make a 'smoothie' with 8 oz of frozen fruit (peaches, mangos, strawberries etc.) put the fruit into a blender with 1/2-1 cup of milk, your choice or just a cup of water. flavor with a packet or two (your preference)of Splenda blend and pour into a bowl of (I use 1 0z of the corn puff cereal) it is a very good breakfast to me. Also I use some sugarfree, calorie free flavored syrups (Torani brand) stawberry or raspberry for additional flavor.So if you choose to you might enjoy this product as much as I do, try it,you just might like it and your body might like it too."
5,The Best of the BBC and Trollop,"""The Way We Live Now"" is a riveting BBC 4 part series focusing on a Bernie Madoff like character, a scoundrel who convinces nave and greedy people to invest in a railroad scheme existing only on paper.Anthony Trollop was best known as an observer and biographer of society's mores. The scoundrel, Augustus Melmotte, entrenches himself within the nobility and elite and wins a seat in Parliament. Everyone around him is treated ruthlessly as he amasses his fortune and spends it lavishly. His only daughter forms an obsessive passion for a some handsome womanizing, fortune-humting gambler and tries to move heaven and earth to marry him.There are several other plotlines and the story does not drag for a single moment. One of the very best BBC series ever."
4,A Must See,I enjoy most movies of this era/ setting. After reading reviews I really wanted to see and especially with this yr being a political yr. The title is befitting to the movie and surprisedly to life today. I thoroughly enjoyed & think all will. Great cast etc. Condition & exspediate shipping was just as seller notated & was very pleased. I recommend to all
2,Not worh it,"Basically a bunch of examples you can find on the internet for free. It doesn't systematically teaches you the programming fundamentals.It's ok for a few quick solutions, but not the book you need to really learn actionscript."
3,Cheesy fun!,"Good cheezy 80""s horror some nudity overall something to watch on those bored days where u wanna see a throwback film from the 80's"
2,"Encore impo-aid vacuun, battery operated impotence device","I was dreaming , this Vacuun would be the solution for my impotence problem...after the ""installation"".....the MOTOR operated by the Bateries.....did not suck almost anything....and I did wait five minutes !!!"
3,My own weird application,"As an amateur astronomer, one of my devices is an electronic eyepiece for my telescopes. This eyepiece has RCA video composit output. I often go out to dark sites with my telescopes and I wanted a small screen portable display to run off the 12 volt car cigarette lighter. This display has worked out well with the electronic eyepiece but off center viewing gives the typical LCD color distortion. However it is fine for my purposes. I would recommend the display but just realize the limitations of an LCD display."
5,Great,This book was very important because my class just started and the assignments started right away. I received my book in a timely manner and the book is in great condition. I am pleased!Successful Project Management (with Microsoft Project CD-ROM)
3,Half Complete,"The book came quickly and in good condition, however the description was very misleading. It is titled ""with Microsoft Project CD-ROM"". This was an incorrect statement. I only received the book. I was not too unhappy b/c I did not need the CD for my class however if I had it would have been a problem b/c I thought I was receiving it. Came very quickly though."
1,Not as advertised,I received this book today and was advertised as having the Microsoft Project CD-ROM but it was not included. Very disappointed.
1,A practicing scientist's view,"If you are willing to base your (or your patients) healthcare decisions on vague analogies and such sources as 'The esoteric literature...' then this book may be for you. I found it kind of boring, and the author's attitude to hard science pretty high-handed, considering his background. I entirely agree with a previous reviewer's analysis ('Fundamentally disappointing')."
2,It's only OK.,"Not as convenient, or comprehensive, to use as I had hoped. I've seen better ""cheat sheets"". I don't use it."
3,solid crime novel but not his best,"This was Ellroy's first published novel. It's a good, solid crime novel. It's mostly in the tradition of his predecessors like Chandler and Hammett, but some of his future trademarks are there, like the seedy anti-hero who eventually discovers and follows his own moral imperative. It's a bit bumpy in spots, and sometimes the plot falls into place a bit too neatly, but it's a good read. It's not nearly as amazing as the L.A. Quartet or American Tabloid, all brilliant books for which he has become justifiably famous. I read this after reading those (as well as My Dark Places and Crime Wave). Had I read this first, I would have been shocked by his later work. Maybe The Black Dahlia is a better place to start for the Ellroy novice.. This one seems almost quaint in comparison."
2,Disappointing and careless.,"Ellroy's first novel, and it shows. Not a bad book when compared with other writers, it's definitely below par for Ellroy. As a former caddie we can presume that Ellroy handles the sections of the book dealing with ""loopers"" and their lives accurately but other than this the plot of the book falls into place ridiculously easily. Is it really so simple to impersonate a police officer on the telephone every time you need some information? The book is also careless. A character is described is ""slim and athletic"" and then twenty pages later as ""fat and strong"". If you read this one, read it before you read any other Ellroy then maybe you won't be so disappointed."
1,Really?,"Okay, I confess, I've only read the first chapter. So far the author has insulted every major ethnic group and religion save the one most currently politically correct. There isn't one redeeming, likeable quality about the lead character and the use of expletives is sophomoric. Normally, I persevere through subsequent chapters but can't think of one reason why I should. Even at $2.99 I feel ripped off. Really Amazon what were you thinking making this the daily deal? Sorry folks, I love a good mystery but thumbs down on this one."
4,A Mystery in Retro,"This is a good mystery. It reminds me of the film noir style.It has that retro feel and transports you to the yester-year of a time long gone. The story has a lot the twists and turns we mystery lovers crave. A definite page turner, that has action and emotion."
3,Brown's Requiem for Kindle Touch,Some decent stuff here but defenitely feels like a first novel. Not Ellroy's best but I bought it for 99 cents during a Kindle sale so I can't complain.
2,"Good Idea, but $...- for a 20 page book?","I haven't read the book, but I refuse to spend $...- for a 20 page book. Of course a hardcover is more expensive than a paperback, but it's not needed for children between 4 and 8 (they are no toddlers anymore). I prever more comprehensive books for less money. (or save the $...- in a savings account for my kids)."
3,Not the best movie...but still pretty good!,"It was a little dull at some parts but also exciting at others. The comedy's okay, has a nice ending. Catherine Zeta-Jones delivers, as usual!"
3,Available much cheaper as part of Classic Sci-Fi TV set,"9 episodes seems very paltry, especially for such ancient, low-production-value content -- At that price I would expect more like all 52 episodes. In fact, you can get the same number of episodes of Space Angel, plus 141 additional 50s-era sci-fi tv shows, for $1 less than this collection by getting the fullClassic Sci-Fi TV - 150 EpisodesDVD set.Classic Sci-Fi DVD has the following episodes of Space Angel:1. Power Failure2. Scratch One Chimp3. The Gladiators4. They Went That Away5. Cosmic Combat6. The Light Barrier7. Expedition to a New Moon*8. The Donovan Plan*9. Visitor from Outer Space** These 3 episodes are also included in 'Space Angel Collection One.'The actual cartoon is surprisingly watchable and interesting, despite the cheesy animation style. Think above-average science fiction comicbooks from the early 60s shown one panel at a time, with audio of the characters speaking instead of word-balloons."
4,Additional episodes on COLONEL BLEEP dvd,segments that make up the episode titled THE GHOST AND THE CRYSTAL MACE (about the discovery of planet of space ghosts) can be found on a dvd titled COLONEL BLEEP AND FRIENDS VOLUME TWO.The SPACE ANGEL segments are numbered 236 thru 240.Here's a list of the COLONEL BLEEP episodes:COL. BLEEPS ARRIVAL ON EARTH (no copyright date)SCRATCH AND HIS FEATHERED FRIEND (1956)THE LUNAR LUGER (1957)THE KILLER WHALE (1957)THE FIREBOMB (1957)THE PIRATE PLOT (1957)
5,The Best - The One to Get,"This DVD of Space Angel is the best out at this time.The mighty Hal Smith will amaze and astound you with his many varied & sundry vocal talents in Space Angel just as he did in Clutch Cargo and Captain Fathom -- not too mention all his work with the Cloakey's and Davey & Goliath etc, etcNow, I just wish I could remember where I put my copy."
4,"great remote, easy to program","Great remote for the money. Easy to program.This remote operates my receiver, lcd, dvd and direct tv (satellite).The components are stored 50' from my counch in the kitchen pantry and this remote operates them all with out problems."
4,"Easy to program and use, effective.","The remote ""learned"" all but one seldom used command for HD TV (change screen format), but everything else works like a charm. Once programmed, the RF commands were automatic. I moved all components into a closet behind the wall mount TV, the master blaster worked virtually anyplace I placed it in the closet due to infra-red reflections. Just plugged it in and started using. Didn't even need the plug-in infra-red transmitters. The remote feels solid and well constructed. Some of the buttons could be a little bigger for my taste, but then you'd have a larger remote, so it's a trade-off. I'm very happy with the product and price."
3,The Time Eating Great Value,"GOOD - RF to IR station allows you to hide your devices and not have to point the remote at your gear. Learn commands on-the-fly for unfamiliar devices. Build custom macros for ""one-touch"" access to your home theater devices. Pretty durable and decently constructed. Feels solid but not high-end (not surprising for the price).BAD - Extremely time consuming to program well in custom situations (MX-850 with an MRF-260 is a pricier yet much better choice). Clumsy LCD screen allows barely adequate abbreviations in many cases.OVERALL - Very good value if you are willing to invest (realistically!) a half of a day to program this remote."
4,"Works great, a few Gotchas","The biggest problem I had was that half (3) of the LED transmitters were bad so that when I switched to using RF, several things didn't work. Hint: there's a hole in the transmitter's case which lets you see if the LED is working when you press a button. I called UR customer support and they were quick to send me 3 more LEDs.Once configured, it works great. Highly recommended. Only minus on operational side is that I can't program unique power-on macros that will, for example, turn on only the DVR, TV and receiver AND set the receiver to TV/Cable when I want to watch TV. The better logitech remotes do this, but its a minor hassle to hit a few more buttons and everything else works great."
3,worn out in two years,"The most frequently used buttons no longer worked properly after two years.The macro function is pretty handy, and programming is very flexible. Not bad for the price."
2,Useless for 220 V 50 Hz in Europe,"The universal remote is supplied with an electric plug 110 Volt, which makes it useless in Europe. Should be supplied with an electric plug 220 Volt 50 Hz to Europe. There is no link to communicate easily with the supplier and no answer."
4,RF20 Remote,"URC RFS200 PowerPak Bundle w/ MasterControl RF20 and PowerBlasterI purchased two of these for the IR/RF capabilities and have not been disappointed. This si a great first remote, I say first because it is not color. This is an easy to program and use remote, even my wife can use it :)"
5,Worth Reading Twice (and more!),"What a supreme pleasure to have all these voices gathered in this volume--voices that were or would have been twice-silenced, as those of both women and lesbians. This tour-de-force collection opens the floodgates for more gorgeous, canny, wise prose from women who love other women -- for all women, and for all men who understand the vitality and beauty of all human connection."
1,"Bad, Bad Camera","This camera takes awful photos. I have yet to take a photo that isn't fuzzy, grainy and dim. I do not recommend this camera. I'm returning it ASAP."
3,Not really impressed...,I was happy with this purchase until I printed some of the pictures. The photos were a bit blurry. The pictures were taken in a variety of circumstances and all looked a bit off (fuzzy). Some of the pics were indoors with a flash some outdoors with the stabilization feature turned on.I did like to size and navigation menus. The red eye feature worked well. The shutter lag was good too; pretty fast turn around time to take the next picture. I didn't like that the on/off button was so sensitive. It was very easy to accidentally hit it. Battery life was nice and long too. I have since returned this camera.
2,Small but not worth the shots,"I purchased this camera for around $300 at Best Buy after all was said and done. I wanted it for landscape shots while hiking. I found that the images remained grainy or blurry no matter what I did. The size of the battery had me out of juice halfway into the Grand Canyon in a helicopter. What a disappointment. Regardless of whether you are in SHQ (super?) or HQ mode, the images were never clean or natural. The video capabilities on it work great! Unfortunately I purchased this camera for the photo quality, and now I am stuck with it. I will do more research next camera I buy, and purchase something a bit more hefty."
3,ONLY 2 PADS included,"The description is misleading and I would not have bought this product had I known that it only had 2 pads. It has 'either knee pads OR elbow pads' and not 'knee pads AND elbow pads' as the description states. Basically it is up to the kid/parent where they use them. There are only two pads included and now I have to go find a set of knee OR elbow pads to make up the difference. Not what I wanted to do right before Christmas. Very misleading.The picture is exactly what you get...one helmet, two pads."
5,Great Helmet,"My son loved the helmet, he is 3 years old, a little big for him but he will soon grow into it, we put a ball cap under it and off he went. If your child likes Cars, they will like this. Of course, Amazon shipped it quickly and it arrived on time. Thank you amazon for yet another great purchase."
2,Empty rhetoric from a jockstrap pragmatist,"Santayana is known broadly as the guy who said that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it -- whatever that means. And therein lies, in miniature, the charm of this tireless windbag, most of whose vast output is thankfully out of print. The statement in itself means precisely nothing, and its perfect emptiness is what renders it most useful. It requires a trememdous volume of ignorance to make Santayana profound, which is, I suppose, why he was for so long America's national philosopher. If you expect philosophers to be blowhards, then Santayana will never disappoint you. For the rest of us, instead of this volume and the five-volume bolus of which it is the condensate, one can read William James' essay ""The Sentiment of Rationality,"" the wisdom of which it, as it were, repeats."
2,Bright lights and weird noise,We got this to replace an older purifier. what they don't tell you is that this one has a lighted dial that lights up the whole room and a high pitch noise that is hard to sleep through. Part of the reason we got this was the white noise effect of the fan but this one has a screechie noise that is not good and my wife can't handle the bright lights.
4,Works as advertised,"In case you are wondering as I did, this one is the -N model with the new permanent HEPA filter."
3,Too loud,"Then machine is probably quite effective, I have no way of measuring it. However, it is very loud, much too loud for a bedroom or a quiet sitting room."
4,lucky,"My entire family noticed how much cleaner the air in out house was after running this air cleaner. It gets rid of pet odor, wood smoke, dust and more. The only drawback is the noise it makes. It is difficult to watch TV in the same room as it is running. We run it on low when we are watching TV and on high at night. It does make a nice background noise to sleep to. Overall we would recommend this product to others."
2,Doesn't do the job,"First, let me say that I dealt with the extreme brightness of the light from the machine with a piece if duct tape. I could even kind of deal with the noise (even on low), but the machine just dried the room out and simply didn't do the job. I was replacing an oreck that I couldn't find filters for anymore, and this machine didn't even come close to doing the job that my little oreck did. I returned this machine, as it made me feel worse, instead of better."
2,Much louder than I anticipated!,"This purifier is much louder than I thought it would be. On the ""turbo"" setting it is so loud, I had to leave the room. Even the ""sleep"" mode is loud enough to make it a bit uncomfortable to be in the room with, let alone sleep. To be fair, I'm not familiar with how loud other comparable air purifiers are. I haven't had it long enough to determine how well it filters the air, but Boy! It sure is loud."
3,She's an Inspiration,"I picked up this book about a year ago because it was unique. It was about cycle touring and written by a woman. As I read I became more and more impressed with Anne Mustoe's travel accomplishments and hope to be able to emulate these in my own travels.This book does not discuss a particular journey, rather it talks about different types of things that she encountered on multiple trips and the people she encountered along the way. She acknowledged in the beginning of the book that another book about scenery would not be appreciated and that it is, as much as we don't want to admit, not fun reading for those who didn't go on the journey. I appreciated the insight on situations and the story-telling aspect.This book should inspire people to take their own trips, especially women who think ""I could never do that, I don't know how to fix a bike"" or ""I'm too old"" or ""I can't find anyone to go with"". Anne has defied all of the misconceptions of what it takes to travel adventurously."
2,Interiors II,"As much as I love Iyanla Vanzant, I was a bit dissapointed in this book. This was basically ""Interiors"", a previous book, rewritten in a different format. The book was good, but it just wasn't the new material I was hoping for."
3,Unexpected,"This was the autobiography of Rhonda aka Iyanla Vanzant. I was expecting some assistance with getting over past negative experiences. No such luck. Mrs. Vanzant does offer some (minuscule) pearls of wisdom but her own story is so overwhelming that it's difficult to relate to the lesson. I also did not enjoy the heavy reliance on the Course in Miracles., a philosophy that I do not embrace."
2,Not what you'd expect.,"If you're looking for a good biography, this is the place. Unfortunately I was not aware of this before I bought the book. I didn't find it at all helpful in shedding light unto my own problems. Her lifestory is intersting, however, a biography was not what I was shopping for."
5,Nice Replacement,This replacement handle is easy to attach however it does not come with any screws so be sure to keep the ones from your original handle. It fits perfectly and seems like it will hold up. I'm happy with this purchase and would definately recommend this product to others.
3,Trenchcoat,Got quickly and in usable condition. Movie had been a rental which I had not known ahead of time.
3,Plunger is cheaper and very effective,"The previous reviewer makes a good point about the use of a standard, ""Home Depot, Lowe's"" $2.50 plunger. If you do not drill a hole in the middle it completely mutes the sound. However I DID drill a hole in the middle of mine, and it works just fine. Used it to play at a benefit concert today in front of 500 people, and with the hole drilled in it the sound was excellent. $2.50 and the labor to drill a hole in the center is a lot cheaper than buying this mute, although if you can afford it, this is probably better.... By the way, since I have not used this mute I gave it 3 stars to try to be fair about the evaluation. It's probably way better than a plunger with a hole in the middle, but it should be because it costs ten times more! If a standard plunger is good enough for Wayne Bergeron it's good enough for me! : )"
1,Missing lots of information covering vintage Robots,"Very disappointed by this book, it's missing lots of information about vintage Robots and not even any price guide.It's costly and the pictures are awful, I would avoid it. Far better books out there."
2,cbx D&G pipes,"While this was the look I wanted. The care taken in the manufacturer of the pipes was poor. The ends of the pipes were not done cleanly. It required the grinding to get the flaring off the end that was left from the cutting tool. None of the pipes would slip into the collector. This extends the assemble time, when it could (should have) been removed in the manufacturing process.The instruction said that no re-jetting should be necessary. I have recently rebuild the stock 79 carbs. I went from a machine that could easily exceed a 100 mph to a max of 90 mph...This is a totally low mileage stock bike.All this being said. This is the price I had to pay for the look I wanted. They do look good."
5,Outstanding,"What a great album this is! It certainly is the best of both worlds, with some Spanish tracks and some English, some fast, some slow. For those of you who have only heard Rick's English albums, listen to this - you'll immediately recognize quite a few of the songs. Full lyrics are supplied.""Salte de Espalda"" and ""A Quarter at a Time"" (both Honky Tonk numbers) particularly stand out as far as the fast numbers go, and ""Podria Volar"", ""Tal Como Ayer"" and ""Un Momento Alla"" are the best of the slow songs.You know how you sometimes get a song in your head and then can't stop humming or singing it? Well, this is one of those albums with just those kind of songs on it."
1,Not what is represented,So disappointed to open the shipping package to see a plain boringtent instead of a colorful themed teepee. My 4 your old grandson wouldhave loved the Indian theme the picture represents. Instead he was unimpressed.To Amazon: You should depict the item you are selling accurately!
3,"Good information, but full of errors.","The topic(s) of this book are highly valuable, but the book itself is full of math errors. Be sure to check the website for revision information. It would be much more useful if the sample problems would have an answer key."
3,Contemporary Engineering Economics,Not the best textbook I have read. Examples in the text not as clear as I would want it them to be in illustrating concepts. Examples could include more steps that are sometimes left out.
4,Good Information...,"I know the author personally and I think the book is not bad. I took him for 2 semester and I enjoyed it, albeit tough. I know the book has gotten fairly bad reviews on multiple sites but it is written with an IE perspective. With that said, I think it is pretty good for a somewhat experienced person."
1,Ugh,We haven't enjoyed this book at all and it wasn't what we expected. Wish I had returned it right away but now we are stuck with it.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"What a waste of 70 minutes of my life. The premise sounded interesting (a corpse recounts the events leading to her death), but even Bela Lugosi could not save this turd from stinking up my DVD player.The characters and dialogue were absolutely horrible, especially the moronic ex-cop/bodyguard. I can take a fair amount of cheesiness in old horror movies, but this went way beyond cheesy. It was just plain bad - and not even remotely scary."
5,My favorite bedding,This bedding is a little more expensive than other brands but I do have to say it is my favorite. We use it for my sons guinea pigs. I also like how it comes in different colors.. not that that matters really!
5,perfection,"I recently purchased this book and I have found it to be the most well written book on trees. Every detail of every tree you want to know about is in this book. I am an amateur tree enthusiast and I wasn't intimidated by any of the reading material, I found it to be detailed with important facts. I find the author's writing style to be very interesting and easy to understand The pictures of the tree, leaves and bark are very helpful. I highly recommend this book for people wanting to plant trees."
3,Well made but a tight fit,I bought this short cable to connect my laptop and notebook to my desktop internet router. The cable seems well made but I found that the coupler end that goes into the laptop/notebook is a very tight fit. It's difficult to install and to remove.
4,What I expected,The product was what I expected and the price was the main reason I made the purchase. I have never gotten a bad wird yet knock on wood.
4,Great Cable,"Littly pricy, but a great cable. You will plug this in and never get another, so why not get it? You may want a longer one though, I just use this from my cable modem to my router."
5,Great short Ethernet cable,"My previous cable kept causing our service to be intermittent, but after plugging this cable in it has worked perfectly. It is a little short so make sure you only need 3 feet."
5,Cables Work Fine,This cable works perfectly in building a home network. No need for the expensive ones.
3,Ends hard to extract from tight spots,"Works fine. Ends click into intended locations OK.But when one tries to extract an end out of a tight spot (in my case from the back of a Logitech Squeezbox Internet Radio), one finds that the design of the ends makes one go through hoops, to somehow press the clip down to get the end out of the unit."
5,Good cable,"Bought this cable and good thing I did, as even though I had some old cable around the house, one was bad, and so the computer didn't recognize the network. I replaced the bad cable with this one, and worked perfectly."
3,I sing of farms,"I liked the Aneid much better. I had read an earlier translation of the Georgics, which was high falutin', deep in 19th century style. This one flows more,and the language is more natural, butI had hoped to tranported back to the verdant fields of Italy during the Roman era. Unfortunately, it made me realize that much of the Georgics happens to be dull."
5,Good So Far,"This steering stabilizer has helped my 91 Cherokee overcome the dreaded ""death wobble"". Thanks Rancho for a great product!"
1,"Too much Strathern, too little Descartes","It is extremely painful to watch the author work hard to interject his scorn of religious people, religion in politics and, well, religion in general. Philosophy and Christianity have had a deeply intertwined and mutually supporting relationship, yet for the author, Christianity was a ball-and-chain around the neck of philosophy and educational systems. Scholasticism earns the the most damning denunciation, it was BORING. This is supposed to help me understand Descartes? Bosh.In short, we learn lots about the author's views and not much about the book's subject."
5,A new direction in music,Afterlife has procured this sound from a different dimension. A new direction in ambient intelligent listening pleasure. Listen and you will make it part of your millenium collection as I have.
1,Worst Accounting Book Ever,I just finished a Governmental Accounting class that used this textbook. It is by far the worst book I have had in 4 years of college. The examples are horrible. There is no color. Most accounting authors try to make the material interesting. This is a book that will turn potential accounting majors away from the field.
2,Tinkerbell Seat Cover,I love the tinkerbell design and the color but the seatcover tore at the seam within the first couple days I had it.
1,Dreadful,"Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful.It's a Sylvestor Stallone movie. That should be your first and only necessary clue. If, like me, you have a fascination with this whole climbing boom and get sucked into watching this, you'll quickly discover what a dog this movie is. Bad acting, bad plot (loosely based on real-life events but not enough so to save it), bad, bad, bad.Only climbing movie that's worse than this is ""Into Thin Air."" That's one of the greatest books ever, but as a movie it's a train wreck."
1,What's to like?,"Bad script, bad acting, bad technical climbing techniques, impossible scenarios, etc make this movie laughable. And would someone tell me if the helicopter rescue team member is really laughing when the woman falls to her death in the opening scene? Sure looks it to me. Terrible casting as well. A really really bad movie."
4,EXCELLENT STALLONE ACTION MOVIE!,"I am lucky enough to have a huge 10 foot screen in my home theater, so watching a movie like this one really makes me appreciate it! The view of the mountains in this picture is amazing and not for those with a fear of heights! Lithgow plays a nasty heartless criminal and does have fun with his role. A great action movie that will knock your socks off!"
5,The BEST RF MEMS Book on the Market,"Rebeiz has done an excellent job in constructing a book that is valuable to both novices as well ""experts"" alike. You will not find a more comprehensive treatment of RF MEMS in one place anywhere else. This book covers both mechanical (static and dynamic)and electrical (EM) modeling of the all important MEMS switch. A survey of MEMS switch topologies and results will quickly get you up to speed as to who is doing what. The discussion on packaging and reliabilty are timely as these are arguably the two most intense areas of focus at this time facing the MEMS community. To round things off, phase shifters, varactors, filters, reconfigurable networks and antennas are also addressed as key RF MEMS technologies that have the potential for great engineering impact. Simply stated, if you have an interest in MEMS, you will benefit by reading this book."
5,Love it,"Great show. I saw the movie and that was the first I had ever heard of ""RENT"" but this really is a great show. This is the last performance I think and this is a great taping of it. Captures all the scenes well and the extra songs that weren't in the movie, are really good as well."
5,Best Version of this Musical,"I have seen the stage performance before in Milwaukee WI and enjoyed it more than the movie. When I heard they were releasing it on DVD/Blu-Ray I was very happy. I grabbed it on blu-ray instead of DVD like I had originally planned. I am extremely happy I did that. The quality makes me feel like I'm on stage with them, and the audio (through my Home Theatre System) is just amazing. The performance by the actors is one of the best I've seen aside from the movie. I can only hope that when I go see the show in Appleton WI November 7th (2009) it is as good as this was."
4,Loved it as much as possible,"There's no way to recreate Broadway on film. I just saw Rent (now Off-Broadway) in April and it was AMAZING. This is not the same experience, but Eden Espinosa is amazing as is Will Chase. Definitely worth buying."
5,Une bonne performance,"Franchement,quant j'ai entendus qu'un dvd ""live"" de Rent était sortit j'ai sauté de joie, mais quant j'ai appris que ce n'était le Casting original j'ai frolé la depression...En bon Renthead, j'ai commandé le dvd, l'ai inseré dans le lecteur et me suis attendus au pire.Oui, c'est Pas Adam, Anthony, Idina, Taye, Jesse ou Jermaine mais bon... Les ""petits"" s'en sortent trés bien. Franchement, n'ayant pas eu la chance de voir le spectacle sur scéne, c'était pour moi la seul occasion de voir ""Rent"" de la maniere dont il faut le voir, je n'ai pas été déus. J'ai passé un excellent moment (merci pour les french substiles!) et je ne regrette pas mon achats.J'aurais juste voulu une OBC performance... Et pour tout ceux qui regrette cette achat, je n'ai qu'une chose a dire:Forget Regret, or life is yours to miss..."
4,RENT makes history again,"Any true fan of this show will want this DVD. The video production is amazing. Sound is great. I wish they would do this with other shows.The only negative I see is that I didn't like the way some of the ""new"" actors came across. If you've been a fan since the beginning (and especially the cd recording) you've become accustomed to certain voicing within songs. It's like going to a Led Zeppelin reunion concert and anyone other than Robert Plant is singing. HOWEVER...this DVD is STILL AWESOME!"
3,Strange Collection,"This is a collection of poetry in which the poems are arranged alphabetically according to title, thus the reader jumps around from century to century, poet to poet, with no connection. This is an interesting way to organize a poetry anthology, but not necessarily a satisfying way. In addition, while I found wonderful poems by Thomas Hardy (""Heredity"" and ""Transformations,"" for example, neither of which I was familiar with), I felt that many of the poems chosen were not that poet's greatest writing. The Walt Whitman choices seemed weak to me, as did many others. Somehow the Shakespeare songs from plays seemed startlingly incomplete . . . as did this anthology."
2,"High expectations, unfortunate result","For a new computer, HP came highly recommended by a techie co-worker. But we've been sorely disappointed. We crashed during the first start-up. The CPU fan is very loud at times, whirring at an irritatingly high volume. Customer Service said that was normal, but no computer I've had before was that loud (and between home and work I've had many). The biggest issue, however, is when we had trouble using the windows media center, Customer service told us we need an updated graphics card! Why would they put together and sell a software/hardware package that isn't compatible!? But I asked twice, and the rep kept telling us we needed to upgrade for the installed software to work. Very disappointed."
4,Cinnamon oil for cooking,Nice product....not as hot as I would have liked for Cinnamon candy during the Christmas season but over all a good product
2,Not Good Enought,"When I first started to read this book I was really impressed. Then I kept trying to find specific information that I could use. There is very little. A good book for history and hype, but there are better books for useful knowledge. I would suggest Kieran's Photoshop Color Correction."
1,Initially works great but easily defective.,This is another product which got defected within 4 months of install. Initially worked well but completely dead after 4 months.
4,"Good Item, Bad follow up.","I received the item and gave to someone as a gift. When they opened it appeared to be missing a part. I tried to contact the seller about the issue, and after a week. I did not get a response. I decided to take one quick look through the box as the seller did not have many bad reviews and I just could not believe I was having such a bad experience with this. It turns out that the main control panel was just much smaller than we had anticipated looking at the pictures provided. Not necessarily a bad thing but a little guidance from the seller would have been nice. Now its been sitting in a box in the closet when it could have been installed. I have yet to see how well it works but it seems like a very nice unit. The main reason I picked it is because it has its own microphone. Well see. If the price was close I would probably go with a different vendor."
2,Research Before Buying,"Not based on the product itself because I never hooked it up. The return was handled well, but they did send the T603 instead of the T605. I have a 05 Honda Accord and it is not the most user-friendly when it comes to aftermarket stereo equipment, I took this product to 2 different car stereo installers in the area, one said they couldn't do it, the other could but it would be about $150, plus I would need to buy a $30 harness for my car. I couldn't find the one I needed and decided $300 was too much for the bluetooth feature. Decided on the Gogroove instead that just plugs into the cigarette lighter. Review will be posted once I receive."
3,"Too much, too soon","...this book said more than what a 10 yrs old needs to know. I want him to know all about the changes he is going to experience, but I don't think is necessary to expose him in the way that this books does it about sex and sexuality. I was impress about the open language and subjects for a 10 yr. I let him begin to read it beacuse he told me he wants to know,he is mature enought to handle this so I let him. I don't know when he is going to have conversations like this with his friend so I want him to be inform. After the first two chapter he stop reading. I encourage him to continue and he said didn't feel comfortable about the subject. I just think he is not ready."
1,Not for younger boys,"I purchased this book and ""What's Happening to Me?"" for my 11 y/o son. He read ""What's Happening to Me?"" with no problem. He started reading this book the same day. He brought it out to me after reading 3 chapters and said he wasn't ready for it and didn't want to read any more of it. He came back out a little later *very* upset by what he had read, crying and saying he couldn't live with it. It took him 2 hours to calm down enough to go to bed. He asked me to write this review. He says the book goes into too much detail about the sex aspect. He said he thought the book would tell what happens during puberty but this book dealt too much with sex."
1,Inappropriate Material For A 3rd Grader,"My son came home with this book for his 3rd grade biography book report. I was reading through it so that i could quiz him to make sure that he read it. There is MUCH inappropriate material dfor a 3rd grader. It is designed for elementary students....but it includes the details of getting his slave, Sally, pregnant (exact word used) at 14 years old. Sally was also Martha's half sister since her dad also had six children with one of his slaves. INAPPROPRIATE!!! This is not an exaggeration!! They also went on to talk about how our Nation's Father died in great debt. How is any of this educational or inspirational to an 8 year old. Someone was lacking some great judgement!!"
3,"Joe Simpson comments on poor ethics, rightly so.","I found this book hard to get through. It seems as though Simpson is trying desperately to rationalize the loneliness he felt in Touching the Void. Fully qualified to do so, he covers countless acts of unethical behavior in mountains around the world and sums up his views by declaring that mountaineering is losing grasp of its humanitarian roots. His proof is unequivocal, and maybe he's nipped something in the bud..."
3,Not for beginners,"This book is not for beginners. Nowhere does it explain the basic grips nor how to flip the sai - the single most important move to know.The stories are interesting, and the kata can be worked out from the pictures (although there are some photos which don't match the description). There are also a small number of defence moves against sword but nothing is shown of defence against other weapons such as the bo, jo, etc.If you are already familiar with the sai, and you would like to expand your knowledge of kata then this book may be useful."
5,awsome !,"How can one resist Paul Auster ? His style and depth takes completely new dimensions from all that I have seen before. So charming and intriguing, his writing is fresh, spontaneous and moving. Well done, loved it !"
3,a mediocre book,"After first reading the novel ""Moon Palace"" by Paul Auster seems to be a quite mediocre book. It just deals with the life story of a man called Marco Fogg and includes a number of sub-narratives. Although the blurb promisses ""the history of modern America"" and the main character`s ""quest for his identity"" and re-examination of ""his relationship with America"" these points are not really clear after reading the book once. I would have expected these topics to be developed more precisely so the reader can understand and recognize them more esily in the book. Generally the story has not got much tention in it, but in spite of that it is not boring, either. It just goes on and on without any climax or specific aim. To my mind the book is okay, but I would not read it twice."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"Great book, very well written. There were some unclear parts to it and I didn't like the ending very much, but overall definitely worth a try."
2,mostly annoying,"After reading so many of the positive reviews on this page, I felt compelled to write my own. The opening of the novel is great, with the story unfolding as this young college kid trying to find himself and to survive...but as the story unfolds, it becomes annoying...the story becomes unbelievable, almost like a big joke with this long winded yarn being spun that leads this boy into a string of coincidences, eventually revealing knowledge of his family's past. the yarn is incredulous, silly, lacking in integrity due to this...and gets worse as the story grinds on. i was so annoyed that i finished the book out of spite for the author (if that makes any sense)i don't remember the ending because about 3/4 of the book defeated itself."
3,Interesting but worth finishing,Unusual story about an an unusual person. Grew weary of the character and did not finish but I can see where people would like this book.
5,Captivating from the first page,I thought this novel was provocative from the beginning to the end. I love books that show how greed and lust rule the lives of so many people. This book explored that natural behavior and the author did a fantastic job with character development and making a complicated storyline seem easy to write. Kudos to him.
1,Picture quality is bad.,"There are many reasons I wanted to get this movie, and many reasons I was dissapointed. I am studying french and am a fan of Charlotte Gainsbourg, so I picked this up. This movie is in engligh, not french, so those who want a french movie will be dissapointed.The biggest problem with this DVD is the picture quality is bad. The picture is more like a VHS tape than a DVD. There was grain in the picture, and it was not clear or sharp at times. It is not as bad as Fox Lieber, but for a DVD I expect great picture quality.The third reason I would suggest people pass on this movie is the story is not that interesting. It did not hold my interest. As much as I like Charlotte Gainsbourg and would love to add more of her movies to my DVD collection, this movie is not on par with her other works."
2,Cement casket in the garden,"This was a terribly dark film. I couln't watch the whole thing. If I had, I would have contempated suicide. Not recommended."
1,Junk,"I ordered this as a gift from my Mother's wish list. It arrived wrapped in a cellophane plastic. When she opened the plastic, the facing on the two front drawers simply fell off. I offered to return it, but she wanted to use it right away so I hammered the facing to the two drawers back on. Would not buy again."
1,Digital Video Essentials (double sided DVD w/ SD & HD),"This was not helpful at all. I could not make the basic adjustments to my new HD LCD television in the ways demonstrated in the video presentation. I could find no reference to LCD anywhere in the presentation; only CRT and projection televisions. When I tried to e-mail support at the Joe Kane web site, I was informed that no support was available. I wrote a letter to Mr. Kane at the address on the web site 3 weeks ago and have not received a reply. If it were possible to give a ""no stars"" rating I would."
2,so so,"Very full of unwanted info. difficult to navigate, still have not completely calibrated my television."
1,"Not a movie about sharks, a movie about poop","This movie is the story of a man, Mark Desantis, who is killed. Mark's laptop is harpooned and then he is eaten by sharks. His friend, Shark Expertman, suspects foul play. So he and Mark's sister go on a shark filled adventure to the bottom of the fishing grounds of some local tribesmen. The tribesmen didn't harpoon Mark's laptop though so the heroic duo look elsewhere. Then they find bad scientist. He is bad, or is he? But he is bad, because the whole movie is bad so are all the actors. The shark footage is good, but because it is literally ripped from past ""Shark Weeks"" it was really familiar. As a final note, the last shot of a shark clearly shows a fishing line stuck in it's mouth. This line has nothing to do with ""Shark Attack"" but probably had something to do with the Discovery Channel episode it was initially filmed for. This movie should be shark attacked. Poop."
2,Not what I'd hoped. Bring back the 458,"This bra is NOT the Lilyette 458, it isn't as pretty and it doesn't minimize as much as I'd hoped. Lilyette discontinued the 458 which was a GREAT minimizer with prettier detailing and more lace on the cups. This one is much flimsier, poorly made and my blouses gap open with this one -- the 458 really did a much better job. Bring back the 458 minimizer!! The bra's elastic started coming loose on about the third washing and it is just plain tacky looking now. This one just doesn't cut it."
3,too much highlighting,The product was delivered quickly. The book has a lot of bright green highlighting throughout the book which makes it a little diffcult to read.
4,Allies to the Rescue,"This is not a review of the product, but the film. Just watched it on TCM. It blew me away. Next to Judgment at Nuremburg, it's the greatest post-WWII film I've ever seen. A very important German peace activist is targeted on a train. Four men who happen to be on the train, from four different countries (Britain, France, Russia, & the U.S.) all team together to rescue the activist. Truly great stuff. I took it for a lazy Sunday afternoon flick, but I was very suprised to see a pure classic. Robert Ryan and Merle Oberon are the two headliners, he the U.S. representative, she the secretary to the German activist. Great character actors round out the cast. Excellent!"
1,Romantic Italy,"I purchased a cd at Walmart this week with the cover exactly like this one and it is a fake.Someone else is singing the few songs that are sung and the rest are instrumentals and not very good ones at that.I am only writing this so that folks will beware of false cds from Pavarotti. People will do anything to make a few bucks.I had to put a star up in order to get this published, but it deserves no star."
5,GRIPPING HORROR,"After reading another of his books, Kindred, I searched out this book. I don't read that much, but this book quickly grabs you and makes you want to keep reading. He has great horror themes, but doesn't overdo it, also he writes excellent characters and draws you in. In my opinion, he is better than Koontz and King, two authors I like and am not down playing."
4,Works great,"These diapers work great and I have seen absolutely no leakage even over night. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because they are actually smaller than the average size charts, (so while I bought them for my 2 year old my one year old is wearing them instead) If you keep this in mind though they will work just fine for you, just buy up a size from what you think you need. Price was still great."
3,Disappointing -- could have been better,"""Thrown together"" is the right description. This was done on the cheap, with lots of stock footage of the 1930s-50s, to his Hollywood days (however, lots of Ed's early home movies & photos had been destroyed after he was evicted from his last decent home in the 1970s). The best parts were the bits from his best-known movies, but I would have liked to have known more of his seedy days & seedy movies - his descent into bad porno films. The feature film ""Ed Wood"" remains the best ""documentary"" of EDW, Jr."
2,Not very good...i've read better books from this author,"Eliphas Levi has a lot of great books that are out there. This isn't one of them. It does have good info on all the elements that you wanted to know, however, there are better books by different authors that can teach you better than this. Only get this if your a huge fan of Levi or get his other books and just skip this one. Not worth the time, nor the money because its a lot of money for a stabled bound book."
2,Sorry...but I'm still looking.,"Bought this about two months ago and am already on a search to replace this mediocre (at best) toaster.Here's the problem:1. While I appreciate the separate bagel setting. If you actually want to ever use this to toast bagels don't waste your money. There isn't a bagel made that you won't have to try and cram into the (supposedly) wide bagel slot. They just don't fit !!2. How is it that a toaster can only toast one side of bread? At first I thought I was doing something wrong. I'm not the best cook, but was it possible I'd forgotten how to make toast? But over and over again...one side of the bread is toasted, one side is not toasted.So here's the cons:1. Bagels don't fit.2. It doesn't make toast properly.Other than that it's a great toaster : -)PS: I gave it two stars because it ""looks"" like a nice toaster. I thought whoever designed it deserved some stars."
3,Not that Bad - considering his producer...,"Black Rob finally dropped an album after five years. His flow is pretty much the same. The album does not really capture any growth on his part as an artist but more or less growth on the part of Diddy as a Producer; much improvement.Black Rob can use this album to build up his career again. He can do like the LOX and leave Bad Boy and really explode on the scene. Other than that, I think he will suffer the same fate as Loon, G-Dep, Da Band and Craig Mack; be hot for about a year, make his dough off this album and then fall by the way-side. I hope this isn't the last we hear from him."
5,Off da Sh*ts,"This is that raw east coast, ny sh^t i've been waiting for. Lately all i been hearin is that dirty south, southern flow. It's bout time to stop focusing so much on tha south n for diddy to do a little less promotin ""tha band"", and a little more promotin cats like this. Robs got talent. 5 mikes.5 mikses.......Sh*ts a classic."
3,Ok,Worked well for a while then would not hold a long charge. I used it mainly for my deer feeder. I ended going with another moulltrie brand.
3,Complaints and Grievances (2001),"This album was originally titled ""I Kinda Like It When a Whole Lotta People Die"". But then 9/11 happened and they changed it. Personally, I think they should have kept the original title even after 9/11. He should have sent a copy to the families of the 9/11 victims. FU(K 'EM! But he doesnt talk political on here AT ALL. Its just a bunch of dumb jokes and observations which are funny but not like his more risque material. But he does threaten to molest a toddler, openly attacks the school system and threatens to shootdown rich guys in hot air balloons into a sewage treatment plant. Classic Carlin. Not the best from the four time grammy winning, legendary comedian."
2,Mediocre quality,"I ordered this pendant because the design looks great online, but once it arrived, it was nothing like the picture. It's very small, and the back of it is completely hollowed out. This wouldn't be a problem if it had a bail you could use to hang it on a cord, but it doesn't. So, in order to wear this pendant without showing the ugly backside, you will need to loop a soft cord (silk might work) around it. In the end, I am returning it because it's just not worth what the seller is charging for it. The quality is not great, but I might have kept it if I hadn't paid so much for it."
2,A little disappointing...,"This is a decent book if you are interested in a theoretical treatment of web services but not in building systems that produce and consume web services. Yes, there are examples, but because the book is not tied to a specific web service platform it is not well grounded. I've been working with web services for over a year now. It is easy to speculate about web services architecture in the abstract. However, when you pick a platform to develop web services on, you quickly discover that you have to keep compromising your architecture because of various limitations. This book is unrealistic: it ignores many of the constraints of the real world. Perhaps it is meant for architects that don't have to actually build any software."
4,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. I own a copy of it, and there's some good information in it, even though it's starting to get a little outdated at this point. And ignore the review by the person who said this book ""is horrible"" and suggested getting Java Web Services Architecture instead. That person *is* the author of that book, and is just trying to drum up sales. I've seen that book, too, and it's okay, but not great."
2,Don't waste your time on this one,This book was so booring that I gave up after reading half of it. It gave me almost no useful information at all. I have not had any practical use of this book so far.
2,Richard E. Grant saves this from being a witchy disaster,"Warlock Julian Sands (One Night Stand, Rose Red) escapes from 1961 Boston to 1991 L.A. who stumbles upon good girl Lori Singer. Meanwhile, Singer encounters another person from the past, Redferne, played by Richard E. Grant (Hudson Hawke, Gosford Park) who is a witch-hunter and wants to stop Warlock Sand from getting his hands on the last pages of a book called The Grand Grimoire or Satan's Bible so he wont unleash all hell. It has some good interesting things in here but really, its much of a snooze fest and Sands is that a great bad guy but the real treat is watching Richard E. Grant play his role to the maximum and Lori Singer cant act. Not bad but not that good either. Julian Sands is in the second Warlock movie and actor Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons) plays another Warlock in the 3rd installment."
3,Somwhat Exiting,"I like cult movies they are good, I would definately buy this movie, Julian Sands is a good actor"
5,inspiring to me,"This movie have meant a lot to me over the ages. Sands best film ever (with Phantom of the Opera as second). He have a great carisma that is unusual when thinking of all mainstream-actors that is out there. And when a movie also deal with my favorite subject it's even better. I myself own a copy of the Grand Grimoire (it isn't that hard to find it as in the movie!) and The Key of Solomon. Too bad they use the name Book of Shadows (which is widely used today as a general term for a witch's personal spellbook), but in general people don't know such things. Anyway, I think it still is one of my favorite movies even if it's old. Go and see it and get inspired! But do not follow the Left Path though :-)"
4,A great baseball movie about life,"The story is real and the acting terrific. A great family movie about baseball and life in general. The dvd extras are great, too. Anyone with a sports movie library must have this one! It's up there with The Natural and Field of Dreams!"
5,Excellent Family Feel Good Show,Dennis Quaid is great in this. The photography is good and the story line is better.A great feel good show for families.
4,Mostly Enjoyable,"It is great to see a heartwarming, real-life story such as this come to the big screen. Dennis Quaid is great and the cinematography is fantastic (if you like the desolate plains of Texas). It does get a little too long in places but that is a minor complaint. Another in the great tradition of Disney films!"
4,A wholesome family film,"This is a good movie to watch with the whole family. It may also spark some interest in baseball for those not already interested. All in all the movie is entertaining, realistic and believable as far as families and emotions are concerned."
1,DIdn't Even Work at All,"I bought this adapter for a an ibook/g4. I plugged in and the computer didn't register any power come in. I tried several other power sockets with the same result. I fiddled with all of the connection between the adapter and the power socket, the adapter and the computer and the connections of the adapter cords themselves. It simply didn't work at all. Nothing. I sent it back. I don't suggest anyone order this faulty device."
1,Does not work!!!!,"My power cord was dead on arrival!! It did not work at all. It's obviously cheap quality, but also the ac adapter & cord that plugs into the computer are a different color from the cord that plugs into the wall. It just seems like they take random leftover parts and put them together. I'm returning this cord immediately and finding a better place to order from!!!"
1,"Good service, but terrible power adapter","I was excited to find a replacement power adaptor for my laptop for less than $20. It shipped quickly too. But after about 2 weeks of use, the power adapter has already fallen apart and no longer works. Waste of money."
2,Unfortunate product flaw,"The adapter was the right shape and size for our iBook G4, but it did not fit the port correctly. This meant that the cord ended up disconnecting with even the slightest movement... the fit was such that it lost contact (and therefore, charge) if it even rotated a small degree.However, Osprey-Talon did a great job of supporting me. They sent a second unit for me to try (which had the same problem, unfortunately), and offered a prompt refund as soon as it became obvious the adapter was not going to work."
2,Adapter Hums and Heats,"The adapter actually does work just fine; however, the transformer box heats up very quickly and intensely. Should you touch it after it's been in the wall for 10 minutes, you will not be able to hold it in your closed fist for fear of burning yourself. In addition, the power cord is short on one end which makes for a disappointing range from a wall-jack. Students may want to look for a product that is longer or, if it is possible, gamble on always getting the seat right next to the plug."
1,"Buy the real Apple adapter, not this one","I bought this to replace my original Apple power adapter, which had become frayed at the plug and was being held together by electrical tape, but then finally stopped charging. I plugged this new adapter into my Apple G4 PowerBook, and it still didn't charge. Since I didn't want to bother with returning this cheap item (and I thought maybe it was the computer itself), I removed the connection at the end of the cord and compared it to my old adapter, which was already torn apart.This new adapter had half the amount of metal wire inside the cord as the Apple one, and it was in a different configuration. No wonder it didn't work! Later that week I went to an Apple store and bought the real adapter - now my computer runs fine. Don't try to save money by buying the cheap imitation. Just get what you need from Apple."
2,power adapter/cord for PowerBood G4,"Initially the product was excellent! After about 3 weeks the cord started falling out of the adapter, disconnecting, of course leading to the shut down of my Mac. Very disappointing!"
1,The Most Boring Play I have ever read.,"There is not a single passage of entertainment in this play, or anything even scarcely enjoyable about the reading experience. You will never finish it unless you are at all interested in the Thirty Years War. If you're going to read anything by Brecht, try the witty 'Threepenny Opera', which succeeds at everything that Brecht needs to do to impart his political beliefs without putting his readers to sleep."
1,Futile.,"""Mother Courage and Her Children"" is a repugnant play. With odious characters, a misguided plot, and pitiable dialogue, it's a marvel this play has survived the times. I would hate to see the play performed - pure torture. A waste of time, and I do not recommend."
1,Waste of money,"No good for a beginner and irrelevant for the more experienced.In the form of a series of questions and answers. It's neither a tutorial nor a desktop reference.If you need to learn CSS try Eric Meyer's ""Cascading Style Sheets, the Definitive Guide"" and Charlie Wyke-Smith's ""Stylin' with CSS""."
3,Fairly Simplistic Recipes,"This book came highly recommended at a recent programming conference. So, I suppose that my expectations were set too high. If you have been working with CSS for awhile, then I do not think that you will find many new and exciting tips in this book. However, if you are new to CSS, then it can be helpful."
2,"Sorry, Out of Date","Well written and easy to use but some ""settings"" have changed on Blogger and it is a bummer to have to figure that out.Time for an update."
3,OK case but it looks cheap and flimsy,"When I received this box I was quite disappointed with its quality and functionality. The construction looks flimsy and the plastic looks cheap. I've expected that there will be separate sections for the reader and for the cables. Nope. There are no separate sections and worst, placing the reader leaves not that much space for the two cables (one cable to connect the reader to your car and one USB cable). Actually, I keep both cables on top of each other. One can argue that I don't need the USB cable but it actually fills the empty space above the OBD II cable.In general, this case holds the reader and the cables, but I would go for something which offers more space for all Equus accessories."
3,good classic country,"Joe has made a good classic country song. The tequila song really went big, but in my opinion its not at all the best one on this album. Joe has a very distinct voice and plays that well into the music."
3,A worthy read,"Not the best of the Tales of/from series, but certainly an enjoyable read. If you buy it, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Okay, but not the best collection of short stories","The problem with this book is that it is a media franchise and the authors are thereby limited. Read the The Best of Fantasy and Science Fiction: 50th edition. Or pick up a copy of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, many of the authors in this anthology (Oltion, Bell, Crispin) often appear there. As I speak, this month's issue has a wonderfully weird story by Bradly Denton and a short space opera by Yoon Ha Lee. Next month (April, 2000) will have a story by R. Garcia y Robertson, the best action adventure writer in the genre today."
5,Little Things,"Graig Wilson's work is an act of genius. In a society where all things are measure by their price tag, Craig Wilson appreciates the small things in life. He has been my favorite write for USA Today since day one, and I was excited to hear of his collection of columns. He is able to poke fun at things, and be serious. His writing style is wonderful. His view of life is simple, and wonderful. Everyone should read this book, and appreciate the simple things of life!"
4,EXCELLENT PUMP,It's light and pretty! It doesn't take much effort to get your tire up to the right pressure and the valve works so very well. I wish I had sized it properly before I went to Lebanon because this one is way way too large for my frame but there is NO WAY I am going back to any other pump! The grippy parts work so well I didn't need the velcro. So there is no real need to use the pump peg.
3,Great Ideas!,"Small Group Idea Book is filled with great ideas from experienced small group leaders. I have used a couple so far in my small group and they have gone fairly well. It's a great book to flip through when you're stuck on ideas to make your lesson more creative and applicable. The only problem with it is could be more organized. Everything is so crammed without space to separate each idea. It would be better if there were several indexes categorizing each idea, so the reader wouldn't have to read the whole book to find an activity suitable for the lesson."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"This is a wonderful book on human relationships. The concepts in this book are well worth working for. As a student of psychology, I have often found conventional psychology confusing. I have held Dr. Glasser's beliefs for quite some time and now I have found them researched and recorded! I am very excited about this book! This book gives a wonderful insight on human thought and behavior. Conventional psychology fails us in so many ways. We can see this as we look at the world around us today. We must each understand one another's quality worlds instead of trying to force our own quality worlds onto other people. If we all worked at simply getting along with each other and finding happiness, the world would be a better place. This may sound trite to some--all I can say to them is ""READ THIS BOOK!"" If you want to get along better with your spouse, your children, your co-workers, etc. ... READ THIS BOOK! If nothing else--do it for your family--especially your children!"
3,Choice Theory,It was hard to get into with the new terminology I was learning in the book but it does make sense. I would like to explore more of Dr. Glasser's books.
4,good for those needing framework,this is a great book for those begining in the counseling field or those who like a serious framework to work with.
4,Choice Theory,"The book was very interesting to read. It is filled lots of information that can help you with relationships, children etc."
5,Everyone should get a copy!,"I love this book. Even though it contains so much information we all know, already, it somehow was just what I needed when I needed it.I give this as a gift to a lot of my middle aged single male friends who cant get past their ex's or cant get on with life as a singleton.I totally CHOOSE to take responsibility for my life, where I go, what I do, and how I do things. My past is my responsibility and I accept that and embrace it. It is very freeing.I highly recommend that you read this book and embrace your choices in life. We all have them!A great read, and even better rule for life."
4,Packed with information!,"After poring over the GRE prep books in the bookshelf, I selected this one because it obviously was much more packed with info than the others. Check for yourself! There is much less white space in the Barron's than, say, Princeton Review's guide. The word list is great, and the math review was stellar. I'm not sure how good the analytical prep is, though. I have yet to take the test."
1,Dysfunctional,It doesn't work; it says there's no DVD in once I've put a DVD in; and I've been too lazy to walk to the post office to send it back so it looks I might be stuck with it since I think there's a 30 day return limit. Not too happy.
1,Terrrible Customer Service,I purchased this item in April of 2006. In August it started to have lines appear across the screen. I called into Poloroid's warranty company and was told they would have to find a local tech and call me back with his information. I never got a call back and had to call 3 times to contact them to find out the status. They finally gave me a local tech's number and he came out but wouldn't do anything except look at the tv because the warranty company never emailed him to verify they would pay for the repairs. Since the I have called the warranty company twice more and been told to wait a few more days to let them contact the tech again. Now after reading the previous review I am going to call in to try to get a refund. This will be my 6th call into the warranty company in over a month to try to get this fixed. Stay away from this company!
1,Cutomer no service,"I am trying to hook a surround sound system to my Polaroid 32"" TV and have not found a way to shut the TV speakers off.I sent an email request to their customer no service because I do not have hours to wait on hold.Now two weeks later they still have not responded.I will never by another Polaroid product."
1,Loose dog!,I bought a Hamilton collar of this style for a large dog. 120#. Chasing a squirrel in the park and coming to an abrupt halt at the end of the lead the steel ring on this collar can move up to the buckle and release the snap tabs. Voila! Loose dog!Not something you would want to have happen around traffic or people who are afraid of dogs.
5,"Quick Dry Cement w/Applicator, 1oz","Quick Dry Cement w/Applicator, 1oz . Convenient. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
4,Another NON-toy,"1) This product is NOT a toy -- it is a tool! (Not recommended for chronological or mental children)2) Same old Testor's glue that used to be sold in aluminum (tin?) ""toothpaste-like"" tubes, BUT this has a tiny dispensing nozzle similar to a hypodermic needle -- Absolutely fantastic for serious modeling work and without the hassle of trying to buy hypodermic needles or syringes from the local drugstore ((Thanks, Crackheads)). Question is how soon the nozzle will plug to the point of unusability. Looks like I can keep it open by inserting a small length of 22 ga wire before putting the cap back on."
5,Heat Of The Sun Is One Hot Title!,"Strunz and Farah are amazing artists. This album showcases their talent, and proves that they are the best in the business. Do not hesitate to purchase Heat of the Sun, or Americas which I also have and can recommend."
4,awesome,My girlfriend loves it the picture dosn't show the color right but i will post pics to show it so you can see what the mats look like.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Like Mom always Said....You live and Learn.This is TOO time consuming and is NOT PERMANENT - SAVE your money for the professional hair removal and you can save what little time you have for better things!!!Used this product just as instructed! All treatments were done on time and the results were A WASTE OF PRECIOUS TIME!I DO NOT think you should waste your money on this item.
4,"Great book, but hard to read hence hard to learn",This book has a lot of great stuff but you have to have the patience to sit down and read it line by line. Can't scan through the book and hope to learn something. Even need to type in the script and try it yourself. Some of the most important ideas the author just covered in two sentences. It does teach a lot of useful stuff but it is absolutely not a beginner's book. Save me from my job interview.
1,Spotting Price Swings & Seasonal Patterns...,"Very disatisfied. CD was extremely brief (about 18 minutes) with no other materials. CD case gave a website to go to that let you download supporting materials. Supporting materials covered a lot more material than the CD did. I did not receive what I thought I was getting. I also paid for 2 day shipping, and product took 5-6 days to arrive. I felt cheated all the way around. I should have used the author website for purchase, rather than the ""used"" section."
2,Not for a family viewing,"We first saw John Caparulo on a comedy tour DVD with other comedians and found him very funny (and clean). However, when we watched this DVD, we discovered his over use of the ""F"" word and that some of the topics weren't funny or appropriate. Even the parts he did that were funny on the comedy tour we watched previously weren't as funny on this DVD. He has some funny parts, but definitely not appropriate for a family viewing."
3,"Certainly not ""The God of Small Things""","When I saw this book on the shelf in my local bookstore, I instantly grabbed it without a second thought.My mind was salivating for Morocco; I was looking for literary paintings of the country I long to visit. Instead I received an ankle deep text, entertaining, but lacking the complexity and metaphor I seek in literature. Freud, however, is able to capture the world ""through a child's eyes"" quite well. Still, this is certainly no ""The God of Small Things""."
3,Much Better Than the Movie.,"I read this book because I am a big fan of Kate Winslet. It was a good book with a good story, however, I don't feel that we were given enough details about the characters. The text was too broad and many parts of the book kept me wondering."
4,The eyes of a five year old,"""Hideous Kinky"" is a superb book in two respects; firstly, in its narration. Permitting the reader to see the world through the eyes of a five year old is a rare treat at any given time, but when the world viewed is one as beautiful and exotic as Morroco, North Africa, the book becomes a modern classic. The second reason that I rate this book so highly is the storyline, and the issues it raises. Does the mother act in love or in selfishness, is the journey to Morrocco one of free will and love or a rash act of irresponsibilty? The reader will make his or her mind up, while treasuring the visions of North Africa through the eyes of a little girl"
3,Interesting & Diffrent dance music,"A dance-group using synths and especially drums as their trademark, pretty unique sound actually. The great melodies match the drums just perfect. ""Played A Live"" was one of the biggest and most played dance song of that year and it's also the highlight of this album. But there's more then just one song here. ""Samba-Dagio"" is a samba influneted song, hence the name. ""A-Gusta"" is a cool song with a electro sound, synths and drums. The group are still alive, recently they had a hit i Europe with ""All the people in the world"" a remix of a pop song. The album itself is passable, defenitely a diffrent experience but the song have a tendacy to sound very simular after a while with a few exceptions. Still allright to purchase."
2,Brought in Dead,Very slow starting but picks up towards the middle of the book. Not one of Higgins best.
1,Negative reviews?,"Let me explain something to the plants that the makers of this product paid to write online reviews.This product doesn't work, period. When I started to attempt to repair a disc, the wheel that buffs the disc immediately started to crumble since it's made of extremely flimsy rubber.Not only that, but after using the product as much as I could, the disc went from somewhat readable to not readable at all.You want people to waste their money on products that do the exact opposite of what they're supposed to do? You want to lie about your experiences using a product that can't possibly repair a disc?You know what? Buy this product, and see for yourself. I'm sure that when alot of people come around explaining how this thing ruined their favorite cd's and dvd's, digital innovations will have to pay for the inconveneince."
1,Don't bother buying!,"This is one of the most cheaply made products I've purchased anywhere! The plastic is flimsy, the belt is thin and it scratched the one disc I tried it on beyond repair. We purchased the Aleratec DVD/CD Disc Repair Plus ( for 5 dollars less than the Skip Dr.!) which worked extremely well."
5,NONE BETTER,"I bought this for my girlie, and she loves it. I love it on her, well I love anything on her. The seller invoice that came in the mail with the smell good tried to charge me $60.00! I emailed Amazon, and when I got my credit card bill they did charge me the correct advertised price, $15.23 & free shipping. When you buy this just be sure to check your credit card and make sure they are on point. Hopefully they took my email and corrected the seller trying to steal from their customer."
1,this card is utter garbage,"i bought this card not once but TWICE and both didn't work in ANY computer it was tested in, almost frying the motherboards in the process. visiontek needs to recall this model because others WILL suffer as much as i have."
5,Neutrogena T-Gel overnight dandruff treatment,"I love this stuff, it works really well and i really pack it on. It smells really good and soothes my scalp when its really dry. I cannot find these products in the stores but always buy it online, have been using it for years. Girls, warning, it will mess up your nail polish though."
4,"A user-friendly, if boring, textbook on comparative politics.","I had to read Monte Palmer's _Comparative Politics_ text for a class. The book compares the political structures and systems of ten different countries: Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, China, India, Mexico, Egypt and Nigeria. Of these ten I read the sections covering Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, China and Mexico. The edition is a little outdated (2001). It doesn't fit well with the post-9/11 political setup, and it doesn't have very up to date statistics for the countries listed. And needless to say, the book itself is extremely boring and tedious to read. However, the book was uncomplicated, easy to follow and understand and very well organized. It does an excellent job at showing the political parties in different countries and the variety of problems that they face, with a general emphasis on economic problems, social democracy (healthcare, human rights) and environmental problems."
5,Country Fan,"Refreshing Country Music from abroad. This debut album struck like lightning on the European Hitparades. The live concerts testify to high quality, without technical abracadabra ! The music is highly recommended to country loving folks. This charming debut singer has the potential to go a long long way."
5,Great Album!!!,This is the best cd I've bought recently.Ilse's voice is fantastic and she is just as good when she's on stage.
2,Boring,"I am a keen lover of African music, I have lots, but I found this album deeply uninteresting. There's something missing here, it's very empty music, no deep African soul, paint-by-numbers stuff. Outwardly the music sounds African, and some of it is pretty, but you wouldn't call it rootsy, as it has a lot of commercial Western touches, like programmed drums and other electronica. Kind of African wallpaper music. Toure Kunda just don't do it for me. For greater originality and more bang for your buck, I'd recommend the likes of Oliver Mtukudzi, Salif Keita, Habib Koite, Cheikh Lo or Baaba Maal all of whom are many levels above these guys."
1,did not work,"The light that I bought doesn't work at all, first of all I had to break off the plastic pieces in order to make it fit into the socket and when I plugged it in only the charging indicator light come on, but when I pressed the switch the actual light didn't work. I gave it one star because I'll be able to recycle the plug and the light when I take it apart."
5,Muhlenberg or not...,"I bought this book because I am a descendent of the Muhlenberg family... However, I never expected to enjoy it... This well written history is the first time I have been so close to the experience of the American Revolution since ""Johnny Tremain"". The struggles you just don't consider as a 21st century resident are strongly represented. Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg left his well-educated world in Germany to deal with an unstable and often unfriendly new world in Pennsylvania. He struggled to create the Lutheran church in America while raising his family and caring for a wife who suffered from seizures. His children went on to be extremely important men in history. Wonderful and important history which includes many notable figures (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Benedict Arnold, Alexander Hamilton, etc.)."
1,"NO SUBTITLES, NO CAPTION","Sorry, but this edition does not have subtitles and caption, in any language. I spent 176 $ with a hope that at least it has captions.. grr"
5,I dare you to try it!,"The FlyLady Knows what she's talking about! Through her own experience, she has learned what works and what doesn't. The babysteps she walks you through definitely work. Starting with a simple thing like shining your sink, you will end up with a greater self esteem and confidence. You will never be ashamed to have someone just drop in on you again. You might even find yourself wishing some solicitor would knock on your door just so you can show off your clean and decluttered house! When I started, I just couldn't wait for friends to come over so I could show them the difference she made. And all in 15 minutes a day. That's right, 15 minutes! I am happier, hubby is happier, and even the cat is happier. I challenge anyone to read this book and just try not to fall in love with FlyLady after the 1st sink shining!"
5,Super Book!,This is a great book with an organized plan of how to get your home and life under control. A quick read so you can get started immediately. This book tells you where to start and how to keep a plan going. It has helped me immensely!
5,AWESOME,I can't get enough of this book. I have read it over and over.It is the number ONE helper to get you organized.From someone who has REALLY been there.
1,This book doesn't get me soaring!,I belong to a group of 6 women that meet regularly and work through a book to improve some aspect of our life. We heard about Sink Reflections and thought we would try it. We were very disappointed. The book was very choppy and did not read well. A lot of the information seemed to be taken from the Sidetracked Home Executive books which we had before this book. We felt that there were too many quotes from e-mails and not enough solid how-to information that would really work for busy people. We will stick with the Sidetracked Home Executives book!
1,Poor Quality Binding,The book itself was a good read. BUT it fell apart on me the first time I picked it up to read it. I sent it back to Amazon and it was replaced promptly but the replacement book fell apart too. This is a book that I would like to use for future reference. I have it held together with a rubber band at the moment! :(
5,NOT A STEPFORD WIFE,Best book I have ever read on getting your entire life together. Written by the most humble person on earth. If I were rich I would send this book to all my friends. Anyone who dislikes this book has a screw loose!!
3,Motivational but compulsive,"I like the idea behind ""Sink Reflections"" and the Flylady and I'm sure this book/method works for the absolute beginner but for those of us who already have a grasp on clutter, I didn't find much new inside.I think the Flylady is more of a motivational writer than a ""how to"" wizard -- I didn't find much value -- some good common sense tips -- but nothing really earth shaking new. Also, her little ""isms"" drove me nuts. Too cutesy for my taste. As for the e-mail list ... good lord, how can anyone get organized when they receive 1000 e-mails w/in 24 hrs? LOL Final analysis of this book/method -- if you need a kick in the pants, get it. If you're already established in routine but want more in-depth knowledge and original ideas -- skip it! Beware though if you sign up for the e-mail list. I'm not joking about the e-mail reminders. They come all day long!"
1,Cost?!,"Doesn't seem right that the Kindle version is more than the hard copy, would love this,but not until it comes down.part of my clutter control is not buying things that take up my space. I'm trying to empty my book cases not add to them."
2,"Not the best, actually","There's some good advice here; however, the turn-off for me is Ms. Cilley's personality, and the book is infused with it. Most of the reviews giving this book/system less than five stars (and/or five exclamation points in the all-caps title) reflect many of my thoughts on this book--the treacly homespun attitude, the annoying religious references, the inability of Ms. Cilley to accept differing opinions (when I once disagreed with her, it was the subject of her next mass mailing), the demands to wear shoes in the house (sorry, not gonna do it), etc. For me, the negative outweighs the positive, and there are plenty of other books out there with essentially the same advice."
3,Not what I thought they would be,"I was surprised to see the size of these earrings, they are so light you have to touch your ears on occasion to make sure they're still on. They have a habit of not hanging correctly. The design is nice but it's almost too small to see."
4,Scene 23 Is Amazing!,"When I heard there was going to be another popstars the first thing I thought was that it's going to be another Eden's Crush.But when I bought this album I was surprised. Scene 23 is an excellent group who can sing,dance and the songs are great!.Especially their first single ""I Really Don't Think So"" which hopefully (the video) won't be a TRL flop like Eden's Crush's video for ""Get Over Yourself"" was (Though Eden's Crush is still da bomb!!!!!). Anyway this cd is also enhanced, when you put in ur computer and you can actually relive the popstars experiance. You can learn how to dance and sing kareoke. There's also pictures of the group and lots more. The cd also features three songs form other artists that were used during the auditions.""I Still Believe"" by Mariah Carey""I Wanna Know"" by Joe""I Believe I Can Fly"" by R.KellyI wish instead of putting those songs on the album that there were more songs by Scene 23 on it. That's why I gave it a 4. But it's still good."
2,Scene 23: Not To The Standard Of A Hit,"This album is truly an EP (less than 8 songs). This was a project to promote POP STARS 2. Like Pop Stars 2, this EP is not anything great to buy. I bought it at the expense of someone else (gift certificate).Now, what has to be addressed is the need to put R. Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly"", Mariah Carey's ""I Still Believe"" and Joe's ""I Wanna Know"" on this. First, it wasn't necessary since the group didn't try to remake those songs and Second, it just invaded space for other songs that could have been on the EP to make it an LP.""I Don't Really Think So"" was at least an attempt of a single to be a single. It wasn't released even though it was a video along with it.Each song was created to just promote Pop Stars 2. From the musicianship to the actual concept of promotion, it's sad that each eccentricly talented person who was chosen on the show didn't get their just deserves. It wasn't worth it."
3,The 7 songs are not enough!,"it's okay... i hope scene 23 gets to have another cd released soon because this one doesn't showcase their talents very well. also, the cd seems like a sampler since 6 of the other tracks are of random things, like the sound clips."
4,E for effort,"Held my attention. Not great, or good. Great to see a movie with real effects no cgi, and no budget. I collect classic Italian, and horror splattered stuff like that. Glad this is in my collection."
5,great film.,"The Odd Life Of Timothy Green , great story line, well created. Watch and enjoy it maybe even a second tone."
3,Expected more.,"Perhaps I expected more from this movie. It was entertaining, but it seemed that it could have gone much more into the heart. I don't know exactly how to put it. I still would recommend it."
4,Nice family movie,Touching movie that was charming and sweet. Good for older kids (7+). We enjoyed the movie and had not expected to be entertained.
4,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"Not exactly what I thought it was going to be. But, I loved this movie. I will probably watch it again sometime. It had funny parts and sad parts and happy parts. Definitely recommend."
1,Good concept bad execution,Disappointed. Trailer created too much hype but the story is very weak and the performances are too forced. The movie is not convincing at all and it's a chore to go through it...
2,Wholesome is not an excuse for a bad movie.,"I should point out that I'm a sucker for a good fantasy story but this isn't it. If you value ""family friendly"" (whatever that means) above all else and if you're willing to park your brain at the door you might enjoy this one. The script is juvenile if not plain bad. Hollywood can do better and it serves movie lovers to look elsewhere (Moonrise Kindom for one)."
1,My PC doesn't let me see it :(,I don't hate it - can't even view it to see it. Should not have purchased the download version. I'll stick to purchasing dvd instead. I wish I could get a refund.
1,"Too ""odd"" without the punch.","We kept thinking the story would get better, and actually the story could have been a good one, but somehow the vibes didn't lend itself to the potential power in the movie. Just kinda flat. Acting was adequate enough, nothing to win any awards from me. I wouldn't recommend paying to see this movie. Ok if it had been a freeby."
3,Was let down,"I was really excited to watch this movie, because I am a big fan of Jennifer Garner. I was let down and pretty confused most of the time throughout this film. I didn't like the ending and thought they could have done a much better job with it."
3,Meh,The kid is really cute but a lot of the acting is over the top. I'll buy the basic premise of the movie but caring about a pencil factory and believing its redemption will come from a pencil made of weeds is simply too outlandish. The ending was telegraphed too early as well.
4,Better then expected,Story to remind yourself to be grateful for everything you have and the joys that children can bring in your life
3,A cute story...,"Not a blockbuster, but a cute fairytale movie. I watched just after the Sandy Hook tragedy, which was not intentional. I was just looking for a couple of movies to watch on the plane and this one looked interesting, not having any idea what it was about. I cried a lot!"
4,Good family film.,"Nice family movie. Great message of love and acceptance. It was a little sad at times, but if course all works out to a happy ending."
3,Cute,This movie shows that not all people are the same. People in the world judge others by performance more than character.
2,Hmmmm,"The was interesting but stopped short of being deep and having meaning to it. I thought I was going to love it and wanted to love it, but I was left disappointed."
3,Strange,"The idea was good, made sense, but kind of felt, what the deal with the boy was, glad to see that the ""parents"" moved on in the end, Not real believable. But the idea was good"
4,Definitely a Disney movie,Cute but unrealistic. Try not to think too much while watching this movie. Good to watch with kids or loved ones.
4,Heartwarming movie,"very sweet and touching movie. I enjoyed it very much, the only thing is it had a little cheesiness in some parts."
3,Movie was entertaining but quality of movie was low,I would recommend the movie. It is an entertaining story line and it is a good clean movie. Very suitable for kids of all ages.What I did not like was the quality of the movie through Amazon. We typically use another company but decided to try Amazon for this movie. It was more expensive on a per movie basis and the quality was not good. There were parts that were very blurry and it actually locked up several times. I am unsure of whether I'll use the service again.
4,good movie,sweet movie. It had a happy ending and it is definatily worth watching. Fairy tales do come true in this cute movie. It something for all ages that the whole family can enjoy
5,The Odd Life Of Timothy Green,This is a great family movie with a heartwarming message about the gifts we all possess. Everyone loved it including Dad!
3,Timothy Greeen,Didn't get to finish movie. Rent time (i believe) was 24 hrs. Something came up and Poof! Will try not to rent another 24 one.
2,Not as interesting as it sounds,"This movie is trying really hard to be that kind of movie that mixes whimsy and real emotion to create something meaningful. But it's forced and it fails, it's also slow and repetitive. The story fails to really ever draw the audience in, things that were clearly meant to be good moments are tacked on and don't mesh with anything that happens before or after, and the acting is unconvincing."
2,BARELY ENTERTAINING-MOSTLY IRRITATING,"Unfortunately, this film fails to make the fantastical notion of a pre-teen boy emerging from a backyard garden to teach two childless thirty-somethings all they need to know about qualifying as adoptive parents entertaining or enlightening. Never really develops either a sense of magic or invites our willingness to ""suspend disbelief.""The amazed parents are mostly irritating in their efforts to understand and protect this child as he interacts with his disciplined, highly motivated, over achieving cousins and their driven mother, his bullying school chums, a cold apparently ""old maid"" town matron, or a skeptical soccer coach. The movie exhibits a better touch in the subplot of the ""budding"" Timothy and a prospective candidate for his first crush. I never really understood how he managed to actually motivate any changes to his various antagonists.For the record I am generally not irritated by this type of movie and wanted Timothy's ""odd life"" to be so much more."
4,Very different...very nice family movie!,"This was totally different from what i expected, based on the trailers. However, it was also much better and sweeter than I expected. Very pleasantly surprised. Wonderful family film!"
2,Nothing New Under the Sun here.,"Would not have bought this movie if I would have seen it first...poignant, yes, but nothing really new, a bit ""weak"" I guess I would say. I own it but I don't think I would care if I ever watched it again. I didn't hate it, I just didn't love it."
3,I like Jennifer Garner.,Scenery and shooting was good. Storey good but I probably did not buy into it easly enough to be entertained by the movie. My wife loved and had some weepy times.
5,Heartwarming movie,as an adult who wanted children of our own and having lost our first child we identified with this couple desiring to become parents. It was a heartwarming movie with a wonderful story line. I highly recommend this to anyone.
3,Unusual and not believable,"Cute story, but not my favorite for Jennifer Garner. Timothy was a cute believable character in the movie. Really--leaves growing from a child's body???"
2,Lost my money,"I got it, fell asleep on it, then never got back to it. Wasted my money. However, never thought about re-ordering it either. Will wait for it to come on cable, as I should have in the first place."
5,DVD,"This was a surprisingly good film, despite the unlikely story that's told. Great family film, and I'm very glad I purchased it!"
5,Great Family Movie,This is a great family movie. I would encourage all to watch and enjoy this fabulous movie. Many themes in it worth talking with your kids about.
2,Disappointing,Disappointing for a Disney movie. The movie trailers shown on TV implied a movie about a fun fantasy that the movie never delivered.
3,Product is fine,Product is fine; movie is just okay in my opinion. (that is why the 3 stars) The shipment came quickly and in time for Christmas...no problems there.
3,Prespective,The era globalizatation after fisnished east and west block grow the models of terrorisme. We can assumcced the prespective and the new model of terrorrisme in the world.
4,Nice Addition,"The ""Dale Warland Singers"" is an excellent singing group. This Christmas collection of 21 bands on the CD were a variety of familiar and less well-known carols. Personally, I did not like three of the carols by Stephen Paulus because they were too dissonant, but I was able to skip those. Program notes were excellent. I was sorry to see that this group is becoming unavailable for purchasing."
3,a very easy workout,"I have been using the bean for 2 months now. Its very easy to do and the video gives you many options. Everyday I do the 7 min work out, then add 50 crunches after. So far i have drop 4 inches, what a great start. If you want to lose major weight you might have to do more then this but it will help."
2,Defective Item,"The bean was a hassle to blow up, and when I finally had it inflated, it had a hole in the upper chamber. This made it useless and I had to send it back. It seemed like it would have been a good exercise tool if it didn't have the defect."
5,why spend more? Just buy these,The cost of buying 3 of these is the same as one of the more High class reactors. This comes with everything you need except for the pump.
4,Hilarious!,Lots of laughs as the story unfolds on this romantic and funny series of events with Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez portraying 2 policemen on a stakeout.
5,My lil' brother never complaints,"I bought this Nascar Floor Mat for my lil' brother it been exactly 1 year. He loves it and never complaint about it. Good floormat, good material."
4,A good buy,"Overall I am really satisfied with this product, I don't feel I have to buy a different model at a much expensive price. I think this one does a great job as well as the expensive ones.And Shoplet (the company that sold me this product) is great to work with."
1,Slot punch broke!,"Ordering from Amazon.com has been a terribile experience. I ordered and got a McGill 16500 Badge slot punch the second week of February. I used it for the first time the fourth week of February and it broke punching through a laminated badge. The badge was not very thick and did not exceed the maximum thickness for this punch. I then tried to find out how to return the slot punch on a very confusing Amazon.com website where I couldn't find a return policy. Since they only allow 30 days to return a broken item, I missed the window. lost my money and have a broken slot punch from McGill."
1,Too flimsy for heavy sweaters.,"First off, the sweater closet comes completely unassembled, so don't expect a ""plug and play"" experience.More importantly, the stiff plastic shelves are not connected to the plastic walls, so when you place too heavy of a load on them they bend. The only thing holding the shelves in place are a sort of gromet on a string onto which the shelf slides via slits in each corner of the plastic. Therefore, when the shelf bends under the weight of heavy sweaters, it comes off the string and collapses onto the shelf below.I imagine I can fix these problems with the creative use of wood or wire supports, but for 22 bucks I really didn't expect to have to."
2,NOT an Adventure Game of Old,"IF you like Tex Murphy games, Stupid Invaders, Syberia, Runaway, Myst, Liesure Suit Larry (Old Games), or the Broken Sword Series, then STOP.This game is the classic Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones Epilogues.I rest my Case ........."
5,Harry Potter,"I love this game, i like the new game better, but this is really cool. The only prob is its kinda hard to fallow along what taks ur suppose to do all the time but non the less i enjoy playing this game :) Shipment was VERY fast"
2,Let-down,"I, like so many others, bought this game expecting something exciting. This is the most boring Potter game ever. All you do is walk around while Hermonie and Ron get in your way. The tasks were incredibly lame. Moving the analog stick for control of the wand was not an improvement. The room of reward was pointless and it drove me crazy everytime Moaning Mrytle showed up. Her voice is annoying.I think that HP 4 has been the best game so far."
1,"Very good book, good presentation of .NET platform.",- No chapter on the .NET XML types.- No chapter on the .NET remoting.but its a very clear book with a good presentaion of C# and the.NET platform.
2,Cute book to read but not fast & easy recipes,"I like to cook but I purchased this book in hopes of getting some time saving tips and recipes and I have to say that while the book is a wonderful read, alot of the recipes have you cooking from scratch which makes me hate cooking.Examples: instead of having recipes using a cake mix and altering it, it has recipes for making cakes from scratch. And instead of throwing dehydrated onions into some water, the recipes actually have you dicing onions. For me, if I see a recipe has over 5 ingredients or the ingredients & instructions take up 2 pages, that makes me hate to cook !Needless to say, I was disappointed in the book as a recipe book."
4,Cable Extension Adaptor,"I can't complain. It performs as advertised. It is an extension adapter. It connects two coaxial cables, and doesn't mess them up. Therefore, four stars."
5,it works,"It works and after checking the DB levels after, signal loss was minimal. So there isn't much else to say. It works."
5,I feel so connected with this connector.,It's like we have a special bond. It connects. Someday I hope we can do away with coax and have fiber or wireless or teleportation. But for now I feel connected with this connector.
4,A great quick reference book.,"This is a great resource for anyone with a need or interest in identifying north american species, archaeologists, paleontologistsand biologists. A bit big for a pack but worth the weight."
5,Great for even young babies!,My daughter-in-law suggested this as a Christmas gift for my 5 month old grandaughter. She loved it! I was surprised at how lightweight it was. As soon as it was unwrapped she was holding it and checking out all the colors. I would buy one of these again! dh
4,Crushing brutality.,"Dimension Zero (Ex-members of In Flames) combine a pummeling late 80's speed thrash sound with more recent Swedish Melodic and death metal influences. Often much more brutal than their peers, if bands like At the Gates, Carnal Forge, Defleshed, etc are your thing, then you definitely wont be dissapointed by Silent Night Fever. Fans of more accessible lighter leanings of In Flames'/Soilwork's latest offerings beware!"
2,teologia evangelica for fundies,"Reading Dr. Hoff's exposition was taxing. His writing in the late nineties without mention that I have found of reader response criticism, post colonialism, and the such is unexplainable unless he is talking to/writing to his choir. I tend to be evangelical and am politically conservative to moderate in my politics. The author is nearly a fundy in my book and his book is an introduction to reading Spanish. Easy vocabulary. Bibliologia (excuse please the lack of accentus acutus) was found at www.rae.es and in none of my Spanish dictionaries.Overall ok in a popular vein. I had hope for something more scholarly. A lot of very old and outdated bibliographic entries imho.Reminded me of Towns' Commentary on John by Trinity. And Towns is definitely much more dated. At least there was some scholastics with Dr. Hoff.Marc BauerMontanaUSA"
4,Nothing new under the sun.,"Lots of new gadgets and inventions today but the old methods of yester year still tried and true. This is brought out in a wonderful easy read and fine editing by Mr. Plamondon. Capturing the past and sailing it into today with good common 'chicken sense' practices. I also have other books by Mr. Plamondon that have that same appeal. Success With Baby Chicks, Genetics of the Fowl and am looking forward to getting my copy of Feeding Poultry: The Classic Guide to Poultry Nutrition. These are a wealth of information for the beginner to the well weathered Showman or the serious breeders.I highly recommend these books."
1,Visiontek Sucks,"VisionTek sucks really bad. There prooducts die, customer support lies and i am never buying one of there products again"
4,People's Princess,"- Hard to believe that the ""peoples"" princess, Lady Diana has been gone since 1997. In Diana: The Last Year by Donald Spoto, the author takes the reader on a quick journey of her life and especially the last year. From the whirl wind romance with Prince Charles, which Spoto claims was an arranged marriage, to the breakup and then as Lady Diana found her groove and sported her wings.This book also claims that Diana was in love with Fayed Dodi and up to her tragic death seemed to have found happiness.The description of Diana's funeral and then to her final resting place at ""the Oval"" island at the center of the lake Althorp where she will spend eternity.Like most of Spoto's book they are a collection and summary of other books or recollection, very limited original research, but a good book to remember and learn of those sad few days."
5,It works.,Easy to install. Works. Protects. This item is no longer available in brick and mortar hardware stores. Glad to find one.
3,Nice but not for younger children,My daughter loved it but it soon fell apart. She was only 2 when I bought this for her and after about 3 months the doll fell off & the box began to peel. If you do buy this make sure your child is not too young and will be more gentle with it.
2,a disappointing read........,"I found 'An Open Swimmer' a very disappointing novel. As a student of English Literature in year eleven, I was required to read the book as part of the course. Personally, I found that Winton seemed to try and make it an abstract piece of writing. This attempted style of writing on Winton's part makes 'An Open Swimmer'seem too concocted and unnatural.I was disappointed also as I am a great admirer of Winton's other works like 'Cloudstreet' or 'Shallows'."
3,eat the review,"To paraphrase the great Randall Jarrell, a novel is a prose narrative of some length that has something wrong with it. Apropos of Ms. Spiotta's fine novel, the ending does not satisfy. The plotting, specifically (which I won't divulge here), turns overdetermined, glib and unrealistically coincidental in the last forty pages, one imagines in a gesture at closure and resolution. But these are unresolved lives she has memorably created, and the attempt to graft a tidy ending to the narrative feels forced and inauthentic. She is a gifted writer, to be sure, but does not yet trust her material sufficiently to stay true to it. Even so, I can definitely recommend the novel and look forward to her future work."
4,An adventurous writer....,"This is the story of two 70s radicals who caused a death and went underground, separating from each other and living for decades in alienation. In the end, it is a sad story of losing life for the sake of an ideal which, in the end, changes nothing. But I guess that point of view depends on your perspective. In any event, the writing is crisp and the author takes many chances, shaking up the sequence of events seemingly any way she chooses. That approach makes the book much better than it would have been as a straight narrative. I was drawn in, both by the writing and the characters and the hope for a reunion. Very cool book."
4,Clever book,"I enjoyed the plot and the author certainly writes well, and clearly did a lot of research. The dialogue seems natural and rings true.The only problems with the book (for me) was that the techy information and the anarchist references are so esoteric. But I just read those sections and didn't seem to lose anything by not understanding the lingo.All in all, a pleasant book."
2,Not so great,"Rather surprised at all the golden reviews - what's so good about it? There's only one main character, which is usually boring in itself, and Mara's as uninteresting as they come, while the rest of the characters are 2D in the extreme. There's not enough magic to be interesting, yet the whole thing is if anything TOO implausable. It bears more relation to one of my Gran's Catherine Cookson novels than Rift or Serpent War. Is co-authorship ever a good idea?"
2,"Good attempt, but flawed.","I must give this book credit. I'm a modest fan of Feist, and I think Wurts does bring a good perspective to his work and weaves in some intelligent politics into the story. I also enjoyed the three-dimensional characterization of the female protagonist, as too few fiction books have them.However, ""Daughter"" is not a great book as a whole. The politics, while decent, are nothing new, and theplot is a bit contrived in order to fit in all of the twists. Second, the ""culture"" is really just a mish-mash of other cultures and nothing unique. In fact, it's actually quite boring, and the book suffers for it. Finally, none of the characters are very likeable. The authors have done such a good job creating a dreary, harsh world, that none of the characters can get by without doing some very ugly things themselves.Ultimately the work is nowhere near as engaging or epic as it could have been, and ends up as a fairly weak novel."
5,"Great, too good to be just 'Fantasy'","Superb book, Mara is a truly brilliant character who develops smoothly throughout the novel, she makes mistakes as she goes through but learns from them. Her character develops in a very smooth way.This book shys away from the cliched use of magic to solve all the characters problems and concentrates on the characters strengths and weaknesses to solve the problems"
1,Will the Real Jane Feather Stand Up?,Has Ms. Feather become lazy? Is she trying to test her loyal fans to see if we will buy her books even if she makes no effort to write a good book? I have read every one of Ms. Feather's books and this trilogy is terrible. Where is the author who wrote Beloved Enemy one of the best romances I have ever read? I read The Bachelor List and started the Bride Hunt but couldn't get past the first few pages. The Duncan sisters are too unlikeable and the heros are 1 dimensional. How could Constance and Max from Bachelor List even like each other let alone fall in love. I can't overlook the dishonesty of the sisters who in today's world would be in jail for misrepresenting themselves as a charity! In the future I will be more wary of Ms. Feather's books.
3,love is eternal,"Good romance novel, but read all of the other books and kind of got tired of it. Space it out and you have a good series of novels."
4,A Fascinating time and place,"The City of Refuge is an interesting story of betrayal, retribution and of a people (the Egyptians) trying to recover from the disasterous reign of a ruler who tried to turn their traditions and their religions inside out. I found the book to be well paced and well crafted and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys true historical fiction and mystery (and not what is called Historical Fiction now)."
2,The VERY Basics,"Do not buy this item unless you need to understand the very basics about relating. This would be good for someone who has no idea about how relationships work (and they are out there, but they likely have no desire to read a book like this, which is sad because they need it the most). But, if you do have some idea, you will get frustrated by the simplicity because it will be stuff you already know. So, go for something more complex and deeper. Give this to your cold, affectless partner who doesn't understand what you mean when you try to talk to him/her about your feelings."
4,Good book to narrow your study focus,"Great book. Written by a fellow Lucent NetworkCare engineer. This is not intended to be a all in one book to pass the exam. This book allows you to focus your studies on what is likely to be presented on the exam. I would do further reading on each topic. I have heard from many canidates that the Caslow book has alot of the more detailed information that will be on the exam. I did however find some errors between the the questions in back of the chapters and the text. Also, the major routing protocols where covered in about 7 to 8 pages each and x.25 was about 20. I have heard that x.25 is not a major focus on the exam, but the routing protocols are."
3,Not a good Book,"I read through the whole book , believing reviews of this book are accurate but i was deceived. It is not a good book for CCIE preparation. I guess i have wasted my time in this bookThanks-"
5,"Excellent size, great value","There's nothing particularly special about this spider skimmer, but it's well constructed and a great size for home use. For the money it's well worth the purchase."
4,Outstanding sequel to Fortunes Favorites,"This 4th novel in her series on the demise of the roman republic is well researched and fun to read. Although there isn't enough on his military conquests, we expect more about the conquest of Gaul in her next novel"
3,YAWN!!,"I have read the first three books in this series and found them to be excellent in every way, but this one was tough. It's loaded with political intrigue, and I think the author got carried away with the minute details of the personality clashes between Caesar and the ""boni"", and the seemingly endless political infighting of the Senate. As I approached the end of the book, each chapter became more monotonous than the one before it. The author was obviously trying to present Caesar as the penultimate politician, who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. In this she has suceeded, several times over. I have not yet read the fifth book ""Caesar"", but I intend to. I only hope that the drudgery that I endured for ""Caesars women"" painted enough background to allow the historically great Julius Caesar to take center stage. I also look forward to the characterization of Vercingetorix, a barbarian who was at least Caesars' equal in intellect and military prowess."
1,I'm either dead or hypertensive,"Was recently diagnosed prehypertensive so got this item to keep track of BP at home. I am a nurse in a doctor's office and get my pressure taken there, but I have to find time for someone else to take it. Wanted a home one so I could also see if there is a difference when not stressed at work. It is very finicky about positioning. The most frequent reading is ""Error"". The readings that I have been getting are generally 20 points off. My daughter who is not hypertensive took hers and it was off by the same amount. It is inexpensive and shipping was free, but still not worth the money."
1,Don't buy it!!!!,"This wrist monitor consistently gave out very high pressure to everyone in my family. After we visited our own doctors, we knew that it was this monitor that produced falsely high reading."
1,More sensitive than a spoiled child,"The ADC Advantage Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor is easy to put on, start, and read but ridiculously sensitive. So much so that if you pay attention to its readings you will end up with high blood pressure even if you don't start out that way. Unless you sit with the monitor exactly level with your heart or lie down while taking your reading, the monitor will almost certainly give you a high reading. Stand while you use it and the reading may convince you to call 911. Of course one should sit still, relax, all that good stuff while taking a blood pressure reading, but this monitor forces you to a degree of stillness that is almost mummy-like.I love the idea of the convenience and size of a wrist monitor but this model is just too fussy for me."
2,OK,I have almost finished but the flavor is very weak and will not order this product again. Will use brewed poducts as their flavor is better.
3,Ok black tea,"I don't know anything about Pu-erg tea, this is the first time I have had it and it's fine, not my favorite type of tea, most likely won't buy it again . I ordered it because it's supposed to have health benefits etc. but I am not wild about the flavor."
3,Interesting price hike,I had this item in my cart yesterday at $7.99. I pop on this morning to add a couple more items to my cart and wow! An over night price hike up to $14.99!! Dr. Oz made a comment in a magazine about the great affects of this tea. Tisk Tisk. I give it 3 stars only because I've not tasted it and at that price hike I'll not be ordering it from THIS (Prince of Peace) company. Too bad all the PoP company saw was dollar signs.
4,Genesis is back,"Fans familiar with the Star Trek movies will recognize the title of the book from events in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn. This book takes the Genesis Device to a whole new level. Someone has stolen the Genesis Device technology, and weaponized it! Along with the technology that was stolen Dr. Marcus is also taken from her secret Federation facility for unknown reasons. Terror reigns on the scale that no one ever dreamed, not just planetary but against entire solar systems. It seems that the Genesis Device works flawlessly, but who started it? And why?This book is thoroughly enjoyable and a blast to read. It ties in story lines from the original Star Trek and the Next Generation seamlessly."
4,Top-notch adventure,"John Vornholt is one of the best of the ""Trek"" writers. His earlier TNG novel, ""Rogue Saucer"" would have make a killer episode. Here he returns to the Genesis Device, the destroyer/creator from the ""The Wrath of Kahn."" Try as the Federation might to erase it all, the technology exists, and someone has loosed it upon the galaxy. It's up to Picard and Co. to stop it before it kills billions more by destroying inhabited planets. The story plays out at a break-neck pace which makes it hard to put-down (and hard to wait until April 2001 to see how it finally ends). Discussions of the political effects of the Genesis Device's existence are clever, and the character dialogue rings true. And Geordi might even get a chance with his obsession, the lovely scientist Leah Brahms."
5,Love it,"This one is a little more laid back than some of their other releases. Lyrically, this album is strong and for the most part there is a mellow kind of depressing feel. Any number of these songs could have been singles. If you like 'Lucky' the rest of this album has a similar tone. I pretty much like all of Seven Mary Three's stuff but this album really stands out, to me."
3,Clever but not as appealing as I expected.,The story was not as cute as I had expected and my son seldom asks to read it.
3,Nice,"I love these small bowls. They are very pretty and true looking. The only thing I don't like is that they are made in China, I try to buy USA products, for that reason I gave them 3 stars instead of five. They are the perfect size for dips and/or salsa. The bowls came in a very nice box with a yellow bow. It would be a nice gift for someone."
1,Who needs a Christ anyway,"Mr. Jones is clearly a heretic who cannot stand the gospel of Jesus Christ, nor the prophecy that announced his arrival. If Mr. Jones's theology is correct, then it doesn't matter what we believe. On the other hand, if he's wrong, there will be hell to pay. This is a risk i'm not willing to take his word for."
2,Nice print but....,"I have owned this printer form 4 months now and can say the quality of the print is very nice, but the printer is a huge memory hog. If I have more than a couple applications open, firefox internet brower and an excel spreadsheet for example, the printer will not have enough memory to properly print the desired page. A solid black page results, of course you have no warning, that there will be a problem so its trial and error. I have wasted a vast amount of toner printing these solid black pages because of this. If you do buy this printer, you should close running applications before printing. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the print quality is good, when it prints."
2,highly overrated printer,"contrary to other reviews-I have printed brochures on heavy weight paper with success. HOWEVER, the drawbacks are numerous: it costs more to replace cartridges than the cost of the machine, I cannot, cannot, cannot get decent quality print on my art work. I personally would have appreciated Mac drivers...I now have to convert documents to print on my husband's PC. (We do not share well...) I am disappointed with the huge amount of ""fooling around"" that seems to be necessary to even get prints... I am getting more and more fond of my HP inkjet. Irritating, to say the least."
5,Excellent value,"I am very pleased with this printer. I've had it for about 6 months.The print quality is excellent; photos are very good.I have it under my desk, and do not find the noise particularly objectionable.Alas, it died after 2 years. Still a good deal for the money."
1,Need tp know what you are doing to make this printer work!,"This line of printers has been discontinued. The ink and drum cartridges are difficult to replace, and the printer has problems knowing when they have been replaced. All this can be overcome using menu commands, that take a while to figure out."
5,WOW!,"This is one of the best Chronicles yet, and not at all a disappointment from the other 3! This is a very good book, and I know it must have been a challenge for KAA to write, and a great read for ANYONE, (though you might be a little confused). This is a very surprising book for the Animorphs fan world. Well, buy it!"
2,Broke!,"This broke after a few days of my son playing with it. Loved it when it worked, but sent it back."
1,Philosophically a terrible portrait of the Second Generation,"Even after all this time i remember the potential this had and the way it disappointed. Hopefully something better will be filmed with the same title soon.The flaws are endless. The story upholds every stereotype and it is actually shocking to find out the director is asian. The director in his own right is very good in ""Bradford Riots"" which is excellent.In second generation however, the underlying messeges could not have been better written by a BNP member!philosophically it is stuck in a dead swamp and does not add anything progressive, distinct or dynamically challenging whatsoever which is ultimately what second generation kids are all about... everywhere, always..in the history of the world."
4,Neat little tool. Fits almost every screw around.,Neat little tool in a plastic case. The bits fit securely and do the job on all those tiny screws that can prove so aggravating. Even has small reset attachment that I used for resetting my modem. No more paper clips needed. No need to spend a lot as this screwdriver with 15 bits does the job.
2,Not Good Material,I tried using the tri-wing screw bit. It didn't work so well and the screw bit itself STRIPPED VERY EASILY! Not a good product.
2,Not Recomended for WII,"Purchased for replacing Disc drive in a WII, The tri-wing tip broke on the fourth screw, and the bit was not long enough to reach two screws that were recessed in the housing.I would not recommend this product for dismantling or repairing a WII"
3,"great price, low quality",what can you expect for such a low priced item?holder is not magnetic but still a great dealotherwise as described
4,Great tool for the price,The tools were effective in repairing my game system. I would reccomend the product for the person who knows what he/she is doing with regards to the repair.
1,Complete Junk,I bought this product for some of the smaller torx and the bits are worthless. The drive is made of cheap platic and looks as though it will break at any moment. A waste of money.
1,Very Poor Quality,"Bought this to fix an XBOX, so i really only needed two of the torx bits. I assumed I was getting a deal at only $5 shipped, unfortunately neither of the bits I needed fit properly. I wasn't able to loosen any of the bolts since the fitment was so loose, so I ended up buying another product later in order to fix my XBOX. I would advise anyone considering this product to save your $5 and go somewhere with high quality products like McMaster Carr."
2,Strips easily and is too short,"This is fine for single use per bit, but it strips entirely too easy. I ended up using a pair of pliers since the bit doesn't seat tight enough, it ends up spinning in the handle rather than unscrewing the screws! I had to turn the bit with the pliers because the handle was useless. Thankfully I rarely need to use this."
5,Best Album Ever,"Honestly, Ashey Simpson represents one of the greatest musical artists to be graced upon western civilization since the Beattles. It's not like she's been caught lip syncing more than once now. It's not like she has little to do with whats gone into anything she's ever made, or that there really isnt any reason why she should be famous to begin with"
2,Not Ashlee's Best Work,"Now, don't get me wrong. I adore Ashlee Simpson! But I found her second album quite disappointing. While there were a few selected good songs, like In Another Life and Catch Me When I Fall, I must say that I like her first album much better. I didn't find any really addictive and outstanding songs that I could spend hours listening too. And this album sounded like anything else on the top ten. I was hoping to see a more creative and mature side of her. But all I got was what's already out there. I truly am disappointed. If you're looking to purchase I Am Me, you'd be better off buying a few tracks off iTunes."
5,I AM ME!,I AM SOOOO SURPRISE ON HOW THIS ALBUM TURNED OUT GOOD. SHE MUST OF HAD A GOOD PRODUCER ON THIS ALBUM.FAVORITE SONGS:BOYFRIENDIN ANOTHER LIFEL.O.V.E.COMING BACK FOR MOREDANCING ALONECATCH ME WHEN I FALL
5,I enjoy this CD...,"I think Ashlee's ""I am me"" is a big improvement over ""Autobiography"". My favorite songs are all of 'em, but the last one is one that if I could I would drop... the album is good and so is the album art and the fold-out poster I got at Tower. I think this is a good come-back, and I am looking forward to her third album."
1,Who's she trying to be?,"Disgusting music, it's not that its negative. Avril Lavigne's music is negative and I love it. This isn't even good. Good neg music rocks, this music is fake trash. the meaning of the words."
1,The lousiest album of 2005 by far,I am me is most certainly the worst album of 2005.I am convinced that most of the five star reviews have been written by her overzealous record company executives or her family members.This album is a massive joke right from the first to the last track.DONT BUY THIS LOUSY ALBUM.Get something nice like LIVE AT ROYAL ALBERT HALL from CREAM instead.
1,I Am Me: A Mini 9/11/01,Ashlee Simpson did for good music what Bin Ladin did for peace and nonviolence in the world. She is hurting American core values on good music with this silly kids album.Her music status will be short lived though. Good music always prevails over this rubbish.Defend America keep Ashlee Simpson away from a recording studio.
1,Blonde again...but still talentless,"This 2nd album of hers is infact slightly better than her first. You can actually listen to this one without having blood run from your ears...or at least on some of the tracks. She gets one star from me for changing the hair back to blonde... and for that reason alone. She's still arrogant sounding, still screaming rather than singing. She still whines that she doesn't want to be like her big sister... sad part is she never has to worry about that because Jessica actually has this thing called talent."
1,Isn't There A Option For 0 Stars?,"Plain and simple, listening to the 30 second clips in the store alone almost made me want to break every single solitary bone in my body, just so I can tear off my arm and hit Ashlee right in the face. The music is drag, her voice sounds worse, if not better at ALL, and she doesn't have ANY talent whatsoever in the music business. Joe Simpson (the father) is more interested in the money aspect of it, and saw a HUGE dollar sign on Ashlee by making her success the same as her sister, THEN becoming her manager. Both should realize that they both need a new day job, because producers can ONLY do so much with a bad voice, and I give props to those producers for staying it out with Ashlee as she probably made you deaf; or worse, dead!"
3,"She should have followed the ""Autobiography"" style","In this album, I think she detoured from her first album. In the first album, there were more electric guitars, more screams and more excitement in the music. In this second album she made slower songs, very pop songs, and melodies that just don't catch you. I think that if she would have stayed with the ""bad girl"" look, this album may have been better.I gave it 3 stars because of 2 songs I really like (the only 2 songs I lke, actually): Boyfriend and Burning Up.Please to all the people who want to buy this CD, remember: This album is nothing like ""Autobiography"", you won't find songs like ""Love Me For Me"" or ""Nothing New"" in here."
1,L.O.V.E??... More like C.R.A.P.,Here we go again with Joe Simpson's second (soon to fail) attempt to show that he has another talented daughter.Wasn't SNL and the Orange Bowl good enough?
4,amazing cd,"I've always been a fan of Ashlee Simpson, when she was an actor and now a singer. I personally liked her first album, but this one is a major improvement. Tracks two and three alone make this CD worth buying! Give it a chance even if your not her biggest fan, the lyrics and back up music are amazing this time around."
1,what a flop,"this is horrible. maybe for a teenage 13 yr. old girl it's alright, but barely compares to her sister jessica. at least Jess can sing. Ashlee can barely use her raspy tara reid sore throat voice to belt out a tune. horrible"
1,A disaster,"I was not a fan of Autobiography, but I Am Me is definitely worse. At least Autobiography was a bit fun in spots. But on I Am Me, Ashlee is trying too hard to seem like a serious artist, and any fun is lost. Also, she's become a pale imitation of more artists. Only one song, ""Dancing Alone,"" is touching - and even that has muddled production."
1,completely no talent,"If you are over the age of 12 and buying this, you have a problem. What a piece of junk. With completely no talent but just the right packaging, marketing, and studio tricks, you too can be a star! I would give it zero stars if I could."
2,Immature and uninteresting,"Ashleeeee. Get out of the spotlight, you gotta butt chin. She's 23 and couldn't come up with anything better than ""I am Me"". This is bad enough, but its the follow up to ""autobiography"". Whats next, ""who I am""?If her cleavage on the front + relation to other talentless ho sell this crap, I have to ask, ""Do you people know about adult internet sites?""."
1,Metane gas will ignight,Lets hope this CD turns into the joke it is. Once day we will visit in a sociological book to demonstrate the challenges mankind faced and some of them so horrid but important to recall.Packed for the dumb - should come with a condom.
1,HaHa this is pathetic,"It suprizes me that even after her little ""acid reflex incident on SNL in whitch she did a little ho-down for us"" she still is making albums. She claims she does not want to overshadow her sister yet she has dyed her hair blonde. Yes Ashley, we know you are you- a pathetic singer shaming the pop and rock music genre."
2,Ashlee Simpson - I Am Me (2.5 stars),"Time ago a wrote a review for this album, but when i read it again i thought "" how could i wrote this!"" i had said that this CD was amazing! but after listening to it a couple of times i realize that this album was only a collection of eleven mediocre songs. Ashlee's first album ""Autobiography"" was much better than this, it had some beautiful lyrics but ""I Am Me"" only had poor written lyrics only talking about stupid things there are only a couple of great songs on this album, in my opinion they are: ""In Another Life"" and ""Dancing Alone"" the rest of the songs disappointed me. I hope that she does a better job the next time."
2,blech,"I actually liked the first album, ""Autobiography."" This one flat out sucks. It sounds like a Hillary Duff release."
3,Decent album,"I would actually give this album a 2.5 if I could, but since I cannot, I'll give it a 3. While I'm not a big fan of Ashlee Simpson, I purchased this CD after hearing a small preview of the album. There are a few decent songs on it, like ""L.O.V.E."", ""I Am Me"", and ""Catch Me When I Fall"". As for many others on it, I can't say the same. For songs like ""Boyfriend"" and ""Eyes Wide Open"", she pratically screams all throughout both songs and ends up sounding more like a hyena than a singer. Overall, this CD is pretty average. If you can stomach Ashlee's nasally whining on more than half the tracks, then this might be a good buy for you."
5,lololovelololo,i just can't get enough of this cd it's just good. the song that i'm feeling right now are l.o.v.e. and boyfriend those are her latest singles. i hope her next single is either coming back for more or danicng alone those two are also good tracks on her album.
2,Not Much of a Ride,"Compared to her first album, this album is rather dead. ""Boyfriend"" and ""L-O-V-E"", the two most radio friendly tracks, are the only ones worth mentioning. The rest of the tracks are uninteresting and uninspiring. Ashlee's first album was so beautiful that you would expect her follow up album to be much better than this. Quite a waste of money."
3,Not THAT bad...,okay this album isnt as bad as some people are making out. it has a few worth while moments such as 'boyfriend' and the 80's inspired ballad 'say goodbye'. 'L.O.V.E' is cheesy but quite catchy after a few listens. The real stand outs are 'I am me' and 'eyes wide open' - both worthy singles and way ahead of the other teen/pop/rock material out there from the likes of hilary and lindsay.theres hope left for a good third album.
5,HOW DUMB !,It's true people are judging the artist instead of the album which is dumb and pointless! You guys are just wasting space on here! In the first place why did u guys buy her cd if u dont like her? That's just sounds like a loser that doesnt have anything else to do in there lives besides making pointless comments about stupid ediotic things that dont even matter. what matters is the music. People want to know if the music in this album is good or not to buy. Not there life story!
5,I cried!,"So heart warming, so sad, I laughed and cried. I know this was a kids book but man it touched my heart and made me hug my dogs a bit tighter. It was a fantastic tale that I hope never happens but it makes me think that we really need to be careful in this world and not mess with the balance of nature because untold sadness can happen."
4,Great read,"Mark Spragg is quite the story-teller. After reading 'Where Rivers Change Direction' and now this, he's quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I was drawn in right away with the realistic coarseness of the characters and he held my attention throughout."
5,Extremely well written,"I enjoyed ""The Bird Artist"" by this author very much, so I wanted to read other books he had written. This one is a very well written, short work, but it tells a compelling story about the many types of obsession that exist in life. The prose is spare, but beautiful, and the tale moves along fairly swiftly to its bittersweet and somewhat mysterious and enigmatic ending. You're caught up in the lives of the various characters, particularly the unusual young woman who changes herself into the embodiment of a figure in a Dutch painting. Along with the title character, you can tell that it's going to end up badly for her, but like him, you realize that, ultimately, there is nothing that can be done. The book may be a little depressing, but that's the story it tells, and it's one that is well worth reading, if you like good writing."
3,Overpowering Art,"The main character in this novel never says a word, or perhaps it says 1,000. ""It"" is a painting, ""Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam"", by a European artist whose passion for the subject of the painting changes the course of every other life in this story. The changes wrought by those influenced by this painting are most strongly felt by one Imogen Linny, who is swept into the maelstrom of Europe by seeking out the artist just as World War II is breaking out. The lives left whirling in the wake of her journey echo the sense of a world out of control. Although we don't hear from the main character, we view it through the eyes of Defoe Russet, a museum guard, who because of his love for Imogen eventually steals the painting from the museum and suffers the consequences of his act. Defoe and Imogen are not the only ones who suffer from the work of art. Other lives are touched indirectly, none to any advantage. The end is with a warning: ""Don't get too close, please."""
4,Roald Dahl for Adults,"Reading the Museum Guard reminded me of the work of Roald Dahl, whom I'd read as a child. The author, Howard Norman, has a knack for creating characters that are awkward and strange, yet strangely familiar. Between the wide eyed appeal of the narrator, Defoe Russet, and the ne'er do well of his uncle, Norman has created an instant classic that will harken adult readers back to a time when reading Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Danny, The Champion of the World were at the top of their summer reading list."
2,Oil keeps bubbling up,"At the core of this book is a Peak Oil argument. The author hedges as to when this will occur, and adds that it may never happen if alternative energy becomes available soon enough and we conserve more today.But technology keeps marching forward as we can see by the 5 to 8 billion barrels discovered deep off the shores of Brazil.Peak Oil keeps being pushed back. 2002, then 2005, 2008, and Roberts is concerned about 2012 to 2015. He had no idea of the huge reserves recently found off of not only Brazil but in the Gulf of Mexico when he wrote this book 2 years ago.But it will never happen as markets constantly adjust and new technology finds more oil. This book is already outdated."
1,socket scanner,"Terrible piece of equipment, I hate it scannner is so slow, keeps changing itself back to RFID scanner, then it does notscan, have to manually go back into the program and change it to CF scanner.I am trying to return it to get my money back, what I wanted was a simple Class I."
4,excerpt in Dog Is My Co-Pilot,"A section of this book, from near the end, is included in the anthology ""Dog Is My Co-Pilot"". Although I found most of the chapters in Co-Pilot to be off-putting, the section from Planet of the Blind was interesting."
1,Interesting book,"This book is antiquated and does not have any other purpose than to entertain. There was a time when you could get reduced plane fares by being a courier. Today, that is not feasible. It is time this book is retired."
2,too little,"after waiting 5 years for something more from cornog (aka east river pipe). Im left waiting for something more. Besides a few decent tunes where his template sound is stretched a little (track #4) there is little else on this particular release. On the first track he croons 'where does all the money go?' while I wondered, where did all the tunes go? It made me really wonder if there was something more that he is holding back somewhere. Seems less inspired and shorter than all the other disks which you would do better to check out first."
1,Poor customer service,"Stay away from any products from Hitachi. I bought the TV 30 days ago. The shipping and delivery was quick and great. But after 2 days the TV broke. Now 30 days later it still has not been repaired. The service centers provided by Hitachi are incompetent and they receive no tech support from Hitachi. Also do not buy TVs this size on the internet. Amazon and it affiliate retailers will not accept returns for defective TVs if more than 37"" in size. You are at the mercy of the manufacturer and in this case Hitachi has provided no service. Stay away from Hitachi."
5,Jeero is the best!,"Jeero is unique. He has a nose. My sister got him for hanukkah and loves him with all her heart. Almost every morning he ends up on the floor and I see his little face, smiling up at me. I always threaten to sleep with Jeero and my sister fake cries. Jeero in the softest uglydoll and he will last for years to come. Uglydolls can get holes, so if your Jeero gets a hole, just sew it up. My uglydolls are Ox, Target, and Uglydog. My babysitter has Wage. My mom has Cinko. My sister has Ice Bat, Tray and Jeero. I HIGHLY reccomend Jeero. :)"
1,Waste of Time,There are so many more books on the market that tell a more interesting and worthwhile story about Macca. One part of this book is almost a direct rip-off of Francie Schwartz's book Body Count (She was Macca's girl in 1968). A much better story of her intense time spent during the White Album sessions and a very close look at the man with the other lads.
2,Not nearly as good as I imagined.,"When I saw this chair in the store and online, I thought it would be perfect. With all the positions and accessories, I thought it would be wonderful to use from birth all the way through the toddler years. For the first 6 months it was great, mainly because all I used it for was a recliner for my daughter while I ate she could be close to me at the table. Once she started eating real food and feeding herself, that's when the nightmare began. The chair is VERY difficult to manuever mainly because the wheels have individual locks, and if one gets locked, the whole thing stops moving. Also, it is very hard to collapse and put back up. When it comes to feeding, my daughter is now 18 months old and 32 inches long; we can't put the tray on this highchair with her because she can't see over it. About 2 months ago, I finally went to K-Mart and bought a $16 off brand highchair and am 100% more satisfied than I could ever be with this horrible excuse for a highchair."
1,no thanks,"I ditto all the previous posters. This chair is the pits. Tray is way to high. Does not sit ""upright"", its just awful. Have to fight with the tray to get it on and off. The only thing I can say is that the cover does wash well in the dryer. I've only had it for a couple of months and I am online shopping for a new one. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one."
1,Terrible high Chair,"This high chair is horrible. Even in the most upright position it still reclines way too much. My 12 month old (who is in the 90th percentile for height) cannot use it. She has to lean forward, get food, and then recline. It can't be safe! The only good thing about the chair is the nice fabric cover. I contacted Evenflo to complain and their response was ""too bad."" They stated that it was not designed to sit fully upright. What a mistake!! We are very sorry that we wasted our money on this chair and bought the Fisher Price Aquarium High Chair and are very happy."
1,Doesn't sit upright,"I thought this highchair looked great in the beginning, but after much adjustment I found that this seat doesn't sit upright even in the most upright position. My 10 month old is in the 90th percentile for height and weight and she still can't sit up and the main tray is too high for her. We use the snack tray and she wipes all of her food on the sides (in all of the cracks and crevices-Yuck!). I WOULD NOT reccommend this highchair-it looks nice, but that's it!"
1,Frustrated and Disappointed,"I never write reviews, but I simply had to vent my frustration over this highchair. Like other reviewers (wish I had read them before I spent $100) at first I thought my daughter was just small and would grow into this chair. But now that she is 11 months old and in the 75th percentile for height, and still cannot reach if I put the larger tray on, I am deeply disappointed. Also she leans forward on her own, without support from the chair, because the damn thing won't sit straight up. I now know I'm not just imagining this after reading other reviews. Do yourself a favor and read reviews before purchasing. This was a waste of $100."
2,Don't waste your money,"This is not a chair your baby can stay in for three years. The seat doesn't sit up, so my 15 month old slouches while he's eating. We've had nothing but trouble with the tray for the last few months. I have to beat it every day to get it off and on. We called Evenflo and they told us the tray was defective, but wanted to charge us for a new tray. They also couldn't guarantee that a new tray wouldn't have the same problems. Life is too short to fight with a high chair everyday. We're buying a different brand."
2,"maybe only for ""fantasists""","I was disappointed with the series (I read them separately and sequentially) because I was expecting something more ""strong"", being a horror fan. The story is ok, but I think it would fare better with fantasy fans. I usually don't read this genre, because I find it tedious and repetitive (as was the case with this series) but I was tempted to try and ""break new ground"" after reading a review about the first volume in the Fangoria magazine. Well, I will not be caught red handed buying another fantasy book, this is for sure (Lord of the Rings almost sent me in a sate of coma, blasphemous as it should sound, but what can I do? It's true.)"
1,Inconsistent information...,"I was excited to buy this book b/c it looked like a quick and easy guide for creating a web site in Flash. Unfortunately, I had to stop reading around page 49. There were inconsistencies throughout. For example, it instructs you to add 4 layers to the timeline in addition to the background layer...but in the next chapter, those 4 extra layers disappear from the graphics and explanations that follow. It doesn't tell you what happened to those layers. Very frustrating. So of course, I could not continue b/c the layers are the central and most important part of the project. I thought this book would help me understand Flash better, but it just confused me. I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money. I do not recommend this book."
1,improvements are insignificant compared to the high price,"I wish to say that I have had great luck with previous version of WordPerfect. This latest version really contains nothing except a bit more compatibility with windows and other server-based word processors.The PDF and HTML publishing option are really a moot point because WordPerfect only produces rudimentary, low quality PDF's and mediocre HTML editing and programming.If that wasn't the worst, Microsoft's Work's Suite 2005 contains 5 commercial programs including Word, Money and Picture It! for half the price of the whole Worperfect Office 12 product.There is just no reason to buy this product when a product of half its price performs better. I guess I would recommend Works Suite or plain Works instead they have the same feature"
5,"Where's the Money, Noreen","As a VHS, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the product. I have not seen the movie in a decade and looked forward to it. The wait was well worth it!"
1,Play station microphone,"We purchased this product after reading the positive reviews to use with our Sing Star Pop game.IT DOES NOT WORK WITH IT!!!! The game will not recognize the microphone. Now we are stuck with a microphone and game, neither of which will work. No separate microphones are available for purchase with the singstar game. Don't waste your money on purchasing this product!"
2,Might as well eat the Mic ! (T ^ T),I purchased this to go with my Karaoke Revolution games and aside from the few positive reviews which lured me into buying this it's crap ! The mic doesn't pick up your voice unless you have the mic pressed up against your lips which pretty much renders your singing useless when a microphone is pressed up against your mouth. I did adjust the microphone settings in the Karaoke Revolution game but that didn't make any difference. The sound quality is horrible and it doesn't work unless you're pretty much chewing on the mic head. Don't recommend this ... Stick with Singstar instead !
1,How dare they.,I can't believe the battery pack costs so much. A seventy dollar toy should have free batteries. Totally ridiculous. Now it's after Christmas and I can't find the battery pack anywhere. Those jerks! I can't even review how much fun it is because no one here has played with it.
1,IT STINKS,IT HAS SUCH A BAD DEAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BUY THE FLEX PACK SEPERETLY SO IT COST TO MUCH TO BUY THEM BOTH!
5,Working out well.,"Got this for my 5 year old son. He only uses it with my supervision. I knew about the battery so I got that as well. So far, the toy is working out great! We use it outside on dry grass only. He has run it down a small set of stairs also with no complaints. When we morph the toy, we always lift it by the tail. It does not seem to transform unless you lift it off the ground (I don't know if it should).Overall, it is working out great. Knowing that this thing is going to be abused, I also got an extended warranty just in case."
1,Big Hearthbreak for lillte ones,"It is very sad to see your little one opens the Santa's gift with such an excitement but can not play since it requires a special pack battery. Ok,Santa failed to read the box but the funny thing is, you have to pay another $30 for it & no store has the battery!!! They ran out way before Christmas!!Come on Tyco-think- this is for little kids specially if you are marketing it for this time of the year. For $100, put every thing together and make life easier for everyone."
4,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,Fast Times is a great period movie! Its an icon of the era! It was a must-have for my library!! Great acting by the entire cast! Should be required viewing for every adult! Enjoy!
3,not so good,I find this movie not as good as people told me that it was.There are moments that are interesting and times that were slow.I especially like Spicoli because of is attitude and how he acted in class(when he ordered a pizza in Mr. Hand's history class).It's the type of film that I like to watch to lough.Do there was some good part that came close to are reality.I give three star.
2,Another FT ripoff - still no no missing scenes restored!,"I can't believe the director of this movie keeps standing for the out and out censorship of this! It's (at least) the third release of it on DVD, and this latest (Nov. 2004) try is still a dud. The big problem remains the scenes which they only include in the cable TV versions of this, but keep cutting from the DVD. Why the heck do they?One of the missing scenes is a very cool safe sex/birth control scene in the mall, for instance. Fast Times sticks out as one of the very rare films that this odd censorship has been performed on. In fact, out of thousands of releases since DVDs started in 1995, this is almost the only one this has ever happened to!So again we can only ask why? WHY?"
2,not so good !!!,"My english teacher showed us the movie. Personnaly I didn't like it not be cause my teacher has no taste . I don't know it's just not my kind of movie. My favorit chracter is Jeff Spicoli played by Sean Penn he remind me of one of my friend. The movie is realistic be cause today tenns are almost like that but it 's a little bit exagerated, like Spicoli who always take his shirt off and takes his vans with him where ever he goes !!!! Finaly my conclusion is : this is for old people who want to be in high school again ... By the way my teacher is one of the best teacher that the world never has."
3,Disappointed AgainHow,"How come this isn't the X-rated version of this movie? We've got prudes coming out of the woodworks in this country. Come on, we're adults!!"
4,AMERICAN PIE (and the like) can kiss my ass!,"Before every stupid Ashton Kutcher/Jason Biggs/Ben Stiller/Vince Vaughn/Wayons Brothers/Not-Another-Teen-Movie teenage movie...there was FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. Hell, even before PORKY'S and THE BREAKFAST CLUB, there was FAST TIMES to set the scene for the teenage comedy. They did it with some style, some wit, some decent acting and a kick-ass music soundtrack for the new '80's MTV era!So to all teenagers out there who think they're seeing something original on the screen today, get to NetFlix right now and rent FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. You'll love it!And while you're at it, check out ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S for your further education."
4,Aloha.....,"This is an all time classic from the 80'sI was a freshman in High School when this movie was in theatres.I thought my next four years were going to be like that LOL.But even 20 yrs later this is still a cool movie, no one can stand to watch it with me because I talk along word for word.I just wish the DVD had all the scenes from all the different versions... IE the television scenes etc.... I will wait for a Directors Cut before purchasing. But this disc is still great for the casual Fast Times fan. Buy it"
2,It wasn't the best movie!!!,"My english teacher present us this movie: ""Fast times at Ridgemont high"" it wasn't the best movie that I ever saw but it was ok. It wasn't my kind of movie, except that I laugh a lot in that movie. Also my favorite character is Jeff Spicoli because he's so cool and funny, he look like like all guys of this new geration, in 1999. Jeff Spicoli he's the best but not a good exemple for teenagers. They got a good sense of humor to make people laugh like me.But the subjet I realy didn't like it, it was so borring, I don't know why maybe because it was a classic movie, if they would do a new version of that movie maybe it would be more interesting and teenagers would like it if it is more recent 'cause school and life in 1999 isn't like before in 1980, they have big different. If you want to see a movie, who present teenagers in 1980 you can rent that movie but don't waste your time and don't rent it. I'm telling you. Anyway that's my opinion everybody have a different opinion."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by the fact that many scenes from the original version were missing. I even emailed the seller to ask was this an uncut version and I was told yes, but the seller was misinformed or not knowledgeable about the product that was he/she was selling.I thought the price was reasonable and it came on time, as promised and was in perfect condition.WHY can't someone produce an uncut version??"
3,"Okay for its time, but not that Good!","I just saw this movie for the first time straight through and really wasn't that impressed. It does capture the 80's spirit and High School life during this decade as expected. The movie really needed more Sean Penn as Jeff Spicoli! He was very funny and believable as a stoner and managed to hold my interest in his brief appearances. Phoebe Cates is very cute, but her topless scene is a tad bit overhyped through the years because it lasts a total of 10 seconds tops. This is a definite fun rental, but I wouldn't add this one to my 200+ Dvd Collection."
4,Be warned --- this is the theatrical release....,"Others have mentioned this, but it is worth repeating: The TV version most people know is NOT represented here. There is close to 20 minutes of deleted footage that was reinserted for TV running time. It's always been my opinion that this footage helped the movie along quite a bit---not only are some of these cut scenes the funniest shot, but they expand the characters beyond cardboard cut-outs. That Universal was too lazy to dig these up is just inexusable!"
2,DON'T BUY THE DVD!!!,"What a great movie. An 80's classic. However, for anyone with a home theater, the soundtrack will be a great disappointment. How can you call a DVD a ""Collector's Edition"" when it is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono?!!! Yes, Mono. No stereo, no 5.1. Just mono. The extras also leave something to be desired. Don't waste your money on the DVD until Universal decides to release it with a decent audio track. And, why did they leave out the extra scenes that are on the TV version?"
2,Where's the deleted Scenes???,"Personally I have this DVD. My parents had me watch it one day and I enjoyed watching it so much that I had to go out and buy it. However, comparing this with the version that was released in the 80s and the version I usually see on TV...it lacks some much needed (and yet, hilarious) deleted scenes....To be honest, I think Universal should really try harder to release a DVD with these scenes restored into the film. Also, would it hurt to at least give us 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround? I also know that Universal has a habit of cutting scenes out of other VHS and DVD releases of films such as Weird Science. If anyone agrees that there Universal should put these scenes restored in their DVDs and VHS tapes, please contact them ASAP."
2,Fast Times suck's,"I saw this movie with my class and i think that it's very poor.They're too sex(the girls are too easy).The sex,it's not for everyone,it's just for adults.I think also that this movie will give bad idea to young childrens because there's drugs,sex,bad words...So you can see that i didn't liked this movie.The characters are not very serious but my favorite is Mark Ratner because he's the one who reflect the most the good childrens.It's not the same life that today,in these years they did what they want (sex,drugs,school).If you don't want to lose your money,don't look this movie ""It's very boring""!!!"
2,Pointless,"Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a good movie if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. Its basically a bunch of teenagers going through life. No real plot or anything. There are a few interesting parts, but other then that, this one is just boring."
5,Havanese a guide to owning & caring,Havanese: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog (Kennel Club Dog Breed Series)A great book for your Havaense collection of books.
3,Not bad.,"Worth it for the Aly & AJ and Circle Of Stars tracks. But some things, such as the not so nice Hilary Duff remix, would have been better off replaced with other tracks from last year's version of this cd."
2,Leaves an acrid after taste,"Underneath the chuckles, most of the characters in this film are disagreeable and unattractive, and after watching ""The Broken Hearts Club"" I wondered why so many gay people like the movie. Instead of being a pean to friendship or possitive gay attributes, the movie left me thinking ""These people are not what I would consider friends."" Pettiness, neuroses, loneliness, bitchy-competitiveness, obsession with youth, sexual predation for conquest's sake----all of these things exist in real life, and the movie gives a reasonably accurate glympse of them. But there is or at least there should be more to the fabric of gay life, and this movie sells the community short. I wonder if the laughter that the movie generates isn't really a mask for tears?"
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH,VERY BORING AND LACKLUSTER. A WASTE OF SOME DECENT ACTORS. ENDING LEFT ME FEELING CHEATED AND TIME WASTED. TOO MANY STORYLINES WITH NONE DEEP ENOUGH TO HOLD YOUR INTEREST. A SHAME THEY DIDNT DO MORE WITH THESE PEOPLE. COME TO THINK OF IT WHY DID I GIVE THIS 2 STARS
4,Cute,This movie was just so real and cute. Had deep characters and I was impressed by the cast. Great little 'gay' flick.
2,Clifford Movie,"This movie stars Martin Short who plays a very disruptive, evil 10 year old. His parents leave him with his uncle and things go bad when the uncle reneges on his promise to take him to dinosaur theme park. The movie had some funny parts although I found the movie a little unbelievable because Martin Short does not even come close (except his height) in looking 10 years old. The supporting actors were acceptable but not superb and the story seemed to move too fast. The plot seemed too simple or maybe just overdone, I knew how the movie would pan out from the start."
3,Not so bright,"I couldn't resist to write my review of this book.Pros:- Excellent review of exam topics- Excellent intro to the exam, and to start the preparationCons:- Even some questions from book do not get answeres with it's content- Required much more ""in-dept"" knowladge in order to pass the examI have many years of experience in this area, and without them, it wouldn't be possible to pass exam, at least for me. The book should be enough if you worked a lot with C# web programming. Otherwise, MSDN, secondary book, and/or a lot of practice can help out...I would recommend this book of course, but in case you are starter in .Net or web development, I would suggest some secondary help to.As any other book of this type, and good advice, any previous experience with .Net and C# is welcome."
5,Pretty Good,"Read the whole book, learned a few new things. Did all 3 practice exams included with the book (1 on CD). Passed the certification exam, barely. But it got the job done. Can't complain."
2,a bit dasappointed,"When I found this, I was delighted. I ordered it, and it took very very long to ship, and arrive. When it arrived, it was exactly the same as something I already owned. The product description was too vague for me to tell what it was. I can't say I'll be coming back unless the descriptions get better. Since I'm blind, it makes no sense for there to be accurate pictures, but not written descriptions to go along with them."
3,critical thinking is sure critical,"i find this book's title isn't matching with the content. i have thought before buying this book that it would cover on the basic elements of critical thinking. instead, it teaches me the process of writing argument essays in which i can find in a grammar books. Well it does cover the subject of argument better than a grammar books do. still i would not recommend you read it unless you find argumentative writing is your interest. then buy it!"
5,Ion Pen,"I bought this to put with my little purse. I don't carry a piece of luggage with everything but the kitchen sink in it but I often need a pen, so I love this one. I attach it to the side ring on my little shoulder purse. I have my phone, credit card, drivers license and cash. Ink Pen and lip gloss. What else does a girl need? My order came pronto and he even sent me a couple of new refills because the pen seemed to be dried up."
5,One who was there,"The only way this album could improve would be to add the best of Vol. 2 and Biograph. For the person who is new to Dylan, this album will hook you. Listen to ""like a Rolling Stone"" or ""Subterainean Homesick Blues"" and you'll want to explore the rest of Dylan."
5,Father of popular rock music,"The album compiles the best popular works to date by Dylan, a clear literary masterpiece. Anyone who is serious about having a complete music library could not be without Dylans greatest hits. I would be amazed that anyone listening to this album for the first time, would not be compelled to investigate this artist further."
5,"If you can only buy ONE Bob Dylan album, Buy this!","This album is great! Has a lot of his early hits, This truly needs to be in everyone's collection!"
1,This book reads like a draft,"This book has potential but failed to develop. There was precious little information or character development that made me care about if they lived or died. Too many things are unexplained. One final thing, is the book supposed to be scary or confusing? It is confusing enough in spots that I had to go back and reread sections. I did not loose sleep due to this book."
1,...not that much!,the book seemed cool at first but it was weird and the story is sometimes confusing and not understandable. i didn't like this book!
2,"Piccirilli has talent, but this is a silly book.","It is obvious that Tom Piccirilli can write - there are a few fine moments in this book. Unfortunately the story is so overblown and the menace so vacuous that I feel cheated by having taken the time to read it. I have worked in a college library going on seventeen years now, and God knows I've seen more than a few people, both students and faculty, with some serious issues - but this is just silly. Really. I've been thinking about this for a couple of days, and silly is the word."

1,Not Worth the paper it is written on,"I have just recently found out that I am HHV6 postive with CFIDS and my doctor told me I should read this book to find out more about HHV6. I wondered as I was reading it if my doctor has even read the book!! I found it not helpful at all, in fact it made a person feel like if you have HHV6 that you are doomed to die. The book had very little (and I mean very little) to do with telling you the facts about HHV6, it was written more like a BAD novel, it went into telling you about the Doctors and scientist who where working on the HHV6 virus and their personal problems and lives! I would not reccomend this book to anyone."
3,Not So Bad,"I purchased this highchair for my son three months ago. Assembly was easy and took maybe twenty minutes. The only complaint I have is that the main tray is difficult to get on and off. My chair has functioned to my expectations. However, if I had seen all of the negative reviews, I would not have bought it."
2,WORST HIGHCHAIR EVER,"Ok, I'll give it 2 stars since it serves its purpose, HOWEVER, the tray doesnt go on properly, the seat goes back and doesnt stay up like it should. AND now, my 20 mo. old pulled it on top of him last night. I was RIGHT THERE. SO, I will be calling EVEN FLO today! Thanks for the bad product Even Flo!"
1,"Impossible to Clean, Unstable and Dangerous","This chair is a constant frustration for everyone involved! It only gets worse as our baby gets older. We are ready to get rid of this and go with a simple booster. The tray is impossible to put on and off, it lurches back and forth (finger pinching!). The removable tray was nice until he figured out how to take it off and throw it across the room. Who thought of the fabric cover? Food gets stuck in the seat - there are so many nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in - I let scraps dry out and then have to get the vacuum to clean it!! As for all the adjustments (reclining, tray positions, height), who needs them?? Even the closest setting doesn't bring your baby close enough to the tray. And, he can wriggle around way too much and we are afraid he is going to turn it over somtime. Don't buy this chair."
2,baby hazard,"My husband and I registered for this highchair because it matched the car seat and stroller etc. But after receiving it and using it I decided I hated it because my son who is now 7 months old hangs over the side and his little arms get stuck in between the seat and the legs of the chair, so when we unstuck his arms it makes him scream. Also you have to almost completely remove the tray to get him out and as others have said it's not easy to put it back on, Needless to say he eats in his walker now. I do not recommend this highchair to anyone that loves there child."
1,"DO NOT BUY, THIS IS JUNK!!!!!!!!!","I purchased this high chair on looks alone [ BIG BIG BIG MISTAKE} . It looks sturdy and decent until you are putting it together. It seat itself [ MAKE OF FLIMSY PLASTIC ] is held onto the metal legs with maybe 4 tiny screws. The ""reclining"" back does not stay in an upright position. Not even worth the $50.00. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!"
1,Horrible chair,"I bought this chair, wasted my time putting it together with confusing directions, and then found that it was just junk. So flimsy we were afraid to put our 1-year-old in it even to try it out. Couldn't get the tray on and then couldn't get it off. Top tray didn't fit right. Boxed it right back up and am taking it back to the store to get a decent chair. Hard to believe they would even manufacture such a terrible chair. I just hope babies don't have to get injured before they are forced to take this thing off the market."
2,Easy Fold? No Way!,"When I chose this highchair, I wanted an easy, no frills chair that could easily be folded up and stored. Putting it together was easy, but the so called ""one hand"" design tray is anything but, AND folding the chair for storage is next to impossible when doing it alone. The tabs on the sides are made for Schwarznegger thumbs, making it almost impossible to fold or unfold. The adjustable height is a good feature, but slides all over the place if transporting the chair folded.For the price, as the review states, it's a good back up chair, but next time I will definitely play with the in store models before purchasing a chair. And from what I have read, others have had problems with many other Evenflo chairs."
1,Not a good choice!,"When my husband and I first saw this in the store we purchased it at, it wasn't set up so we went by the description on the box and the picture and thoght it looked and sounded great. So we get it home and not a good choice! The box said the tray was a one hand operation, two hands couldn't even operate this correctly! It was very hard to ever get the tray on and our daughter would get her feet caught underneath, so your not only looking for two yellow balls to line up, but your also trying to keep your child from getting injured! Then the cushion on the chair didn't fully stay on and food constantly gets under it- we returned the chair and spent more on a great chair by Graco. This chair would only be good if you need it for an emergency!!!!"
2,Not so easy to clean,"We have had this chair for our son for a few months, we haven't had all the problems most people seemed to have. What we do have is problems keeping this thing clean. With the plethora of cracks, crevices and hidey holes, it seems we pull out enough food to feed a third world country. You can't wipe the food out, it just pushes it further into the crevices. The easiest way to clean it, is to take it outside and use the pressure washer.It is not bad, but would not recomend it to anyone."
4,Nice Chair,No frills with this chair but serves it's purpose. Easy to handle. Baby seems to be content when being fed.
1,Another Dishonest and Self-Promotional Work,"Actually, if the reader can get beyond the Eckankar dogma and Twitchell's self-promotional tactics this book can be a good read! Just substitute your own Higher Self or God-soul in place of Rebarz. Twitchell created the character of Rebazar Tarzs in order to claim initiation into the order of Vairag Adepts (found in his previous spiritual path of Radha Soami Satsang). He was no longer a chela of Kirpal Singh (his real former Master) and thus created Eckankar and a lineage of Masters through plagiarism and lies. Twitchell claims his old Master was Sudar Singh, but why was Twitchell not appointed as mahanta/Master when Sudar died if this was true? Who took Sudar's place then? Thus, the need for the Tibetan... Rebazar Tarzs to take the place of the imaginary Sudar. Anyway, as you can see Twitchell's accounts of these meetings with the ""Tibetan"" now become suspect."
4,"Good, but not that great!","I enjoyed the Daimajin movies alot, but if you're into just watching monsters trash cities this collection is not for you. The Daimajin movies are very story driven unlike most godzilla flicks."
1,Box listed as Japanese with English Subtitles,There are no English subtitles to any of the discs. I have tried everything to get subtitlbes to work. The cinamatography is excellent but unless you are fluent in Japanese.
2,Simultaneously boring and yet interesting,"This book by McKiernan is the first book in my life that I have ever found to be both interesting and insanely boring at the same time.While the plot is sound and you care about the outcome of the main characters, you constantly find your interest fading in his constant verbose passages about absolutely nothing. The first three hundred pages seem to be him setting the scene for something that never happens, and appears to just be taking up unnecessary space.Of most annoyance are plot hints that are dropped here and there as though no one would pick up on them, but easily give away the outcome of the book.I give it a solid 2 simply for the fact that the outcome was important enough to me for me to finish it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, however, as it is extremely heavy reading and difficult to push yourself through."
4,Decent Book for Reference,This book would be great if you wanted to build an old gun...It is packed with gun mechanism diagrams....It is sorta weak in the edged weapons wection I thought...He doesn't do a really great job of describing some of the items....Better diagrams would have helped...The armor section is pretty nice if you are into that stuff...But..Hey..I learned what a halberd is!!!
5,Psychology and Political Violence,This book should be read by every political scientist interested in the role of mass violence in politics. It explores how politically salient identities can become the psychological basis for violence.
4,Great for Beginners,"This dvd is a great introduction to training in Capoeira. Presented as a Capoeira home movie, this tape allows you to take part in a Capoeira class and observe training without being distracted by a narrator's own particular feelings. There are some shaky camera movements and angels, but overall this video can help you start your journey into the world of Capoeira. Axé!"
3,For Chris Farley Fans Only.,"A Klutzy Overweight Orphan (Chris Farley) with a Soft heart is Raised by a Ninja Clan. When he meets a Attractive Mystery Woman (Nicolette Sheridan), hired him to Spy on her Corrupted Boyfriend (Mathaniel Parker), who is actually a Counterfeiter and a Murderer. The Overweight Ninja goes to America to Protect the Mystery Woman with the Help, which he`s doesn`t know by his Step-Brother (Robin Shou).Directed by Dennis Dugan (Problem Child, Happy Gilmore, Saving Silverman) made a Clumsy and Lousy Comedy but at times, it`s Very Funny. Chris Rock has a Supporting Role as a Bellboy, who befriend with the Clumsy Ninja. This was a Box Office Hit in Theaters and Also a Hit on Video. This was Chris Farley`s Thrid Lead Role, his last was the Underrated Almost Heroes. Fans of Farley and young Teens will enjoy this more than Modern Audiences. Grade:B."
1,"Downright Silly, Not Funny","Chris Farley plays the role of a clumsy ninja, ridiculous to the extent that I feel that it is an insult to ninjas. The movie is plain silly, not funny. This guy is worse than Jar-Jar Binks.Hard to imagine anybody could find this show funny.This is the worst comedy that I come across so far."
5,must see movie,"this movie was one of chris farley's best. it has comedy, action, and a fat sweaty guy.it has pleanty of physical comedy as well as verbel comedy. and with a cameo of chris rock that just makes the movie even better."
3,Repair manual for older JEEP,Helpfull but not as good as CHILTON JEEP Wagoneer/Commando/Cherokee 1957-83 Repair Manual. Recommend getting the above first. Shipping was fast and highly recommend Amazon if you are going to purchase this and any other repair manual.
3,Fair read but not a 'smoking bullet.',"I guess I wa looking for something new that I hadn't read before. Too many conspiracy theories thrown together to make sense. The best in this genre are 'Alien Agenda' by the bestselling author, Jim Marrs, 'Alien Rapture' a fast paced conspiracy thriller by Steiger and an ex-black programs insider, and 'Rainbow' conspiracy by Steiger."
1,Fundamentalist Christian material,"Very curious tract. About half the book is pretty standard material on UFOs, ETs, free energy, Freemasonry, Bilderberg group, and similar topics. So far, so good, although hardly ground-breaking. But the other half of the book tells you that the world is in deep doo-doo, so what you must do is...yes, I kid you not, read the Bible and hold forth for the Second Coming, whereupon you shall be saved. See, it's very easy, just do what the man tells you to do! Sure..."
1,"china 9, liberty 37","this was supposed to be an unedited version of the movies, including the 2 hot love scenes. they are deleted. i wish to return this movies. very disappointed."
5,FAR OUTPACES SIMILAR SOFTWARE,"Have been looking for a product that is easy but powerful to work with multiple video files, do the edits, insert transition and effects, and implement near pinpoint timing of audio elements. This product does it all as represented and if I didn't stumble upon it at an incredibly low price, I wouldn't have investigated it at all. For those yearning for its limitations, the only suggestion would have been for the manufacturer to provide a video of putting together a sample edited video. Otherwise, one has to click on the icons to learn the parameters of offered features, but again the time involved to pursue it is small compared to the power and ease of the product."
3,"A entertaining movie with some minor flaws. Still, SEE IT!","My friends still tell me how stupid I was to buy the DVD. I disagree. I thought this movie was very entertaining. Vertical Limit was one of those movies where every little detail went wrong and added more to the story. For some movies, this idea went well. But I think that it was the exact opposite of that. The story had some pretty wild parts. Some very unbelievable, corny, and very stupid parts. I thought they were cool at first, but then watched it for a second time seeing that it was just pretty stupid. All in all, I think this is not a bad movie. I just thought it could have been better. It was entertaining the first time but got old fast. But still, SEE IT!!"
3,The Trailer was more Entertaining than the Film.,"""Vertical Limit"" is a Fun Thrill Ride, which is to be Expected, some might also want a bit of Depth, or Character. Those who do will feel somewhat Letdown. Characters with Real Emotion and Reactions, Characters who we learn about and grow to care, if your looking for Characters like these.. Look Elsewhere. If your looking for two hours of Mindless Action and Thrills.. Look no Further.The Cinematography is Mind-Blowing, the Stunts are Unbelievable, Martin Campbell's Direction is pretty Standard Issue for him and the ""Personality-Plus"" Supporting Cast are Three times more interesting than then ""Dull-as-Dishwater"" Leads. (Chris O'Donnell and Robin Tunney are as Bland and Lifeless as 2 Stale pieces of Toast)If you go in expecting Cardboard Characters, Explosions, Close Calls and Inane Dialogue, you'll have a Great Time. If you Expect More.. I'll keep an Eye out for your 2 star review.P.S. If you've seen the Preview, you've virtually seen the film."
4,Better Storyline Than Cliff Hanger,"Vertical Limit has some excellent effects in a film that was better than i expected. The film is about a brother sister combo who always climbed with their father when they were younger, when due to a tragic accident their father was killed. The film contiues later along the line with the children not talking to each other and living their seperste lives when they meetup on a climbing expedition. The brother played by Chris O'donnell arrives at base camp to find his sister (Robin Tunney) is the leader of a party of rich business men whos sole aim is to reach the peak of the mountain in time to correspond with the flying of a plane. (recently launched from their new airline) What follows is a film full of special effects and cliffhangers that make the film one of the most watched films of the year. Bill Paxton plays his role to the usual standard that we have begun to expect from him, which make this cast come alive and portray the film to the best of their ability"
1,Don't waste your money or time,"Don't buy. Don't even rent. You'll regret the money (and even time) spent. The special effects are mostly adequate, and there is some great mountain scenery. I might of given it 2 stars to acknowledge that, but I want to bring down the average if I can, so that others may avoid this movie. It's the plot. Pointless, unbelievable, contrived challenge followed by dramatic skin-of-the-teeth resolution. Repeat a dozen times. One of those where you want to throw your remote at the screen or just turn it off and walk away. Roger Ebert should apologise for his moderately complimentary review. Ed Viesturs should dissacoiate himself from this movie."
3,Long and gross some parts were good though.,My family and I went to the theaters to see it and none of us thought much of it. But some parts in this movie were intense and breathtaking. I would probably watch it again. But it's your choice! Although I would not recommend it to children under 10.
4,Wonderful Action Packed Adventure Film,"Forget What The Critics might have said about this movie,because frankly it doesn't really matter what they think,because they give bad reviews to almost every movie they see.Chris O'Donnel leads an all star cast that includes - Robin Tunney, Bill Paxton and Scott Glenn,they all shine here in this action packed extravaganza. You can read what the movie is about in other reviews but i won't spoil anything for you here.As he did with Goldeneye and The Mask of Zorro,Martin Campbell once again gives us a wonderful action packed movie,with a great story,great acting and awesome action sequences.Also to note,the special effects add to the excitement.If you like movies with thrills,chills,pure excitement and beauty i recommend this winner from Martin Campbell."
4,Gives Me Frostbite Watching It,this movie had awesome special effects. I liked it better than cliffhanger because I liked the actors better. By this dvd if you love movies where if you blink you'llmiss something amazing.......
2,I was all set to like this movie.....,"I love climbing movies, I climb a fair amount myself, I love action movies. How could I not like this movie, right?This movie makes Cliffhanger look like a masterpiece. Yeah, cliffhanger, the one where Slyvester Stallone carries a rope through most of the movie and never, ever uses it. The special effects are relatively good, but the plot is the most nonsensical I have seen. I hate to give away the plot (though I use the word plot very loosely here), but I would think even a ... kindergartener would think twice before they backpacked nitroglycerin up a mountain that is avalanche prone. If you want a halfway decent climbing movie go see the old movie ""K2"", or the Eiger Sanction. Or heck, even Cliffhanger with all its flaws. The IMAX Everest films are spectacular also, though perhaps a bit too realistic for some."
3,"Good fx, tried and true plot, decent primary cast.","I actually enjoyed this movie - the pace was quick, the acting well done, and I have to admit - I really hadn't expected Bill Paxton in the role of ""bad guy"".Was the movie believable? Probably not. But that's not why we see movies, is it? Or at least, that's not why I watch a movie. Was Terminator believable? Or any Steven Segal movie?We watch movies to see ordinary people lead extra-ordinary lives. And I think this movie fills that order.Are there some Hollywood cliches? Of course. But the acting was solid. The motivation for both siblings' career choices are clear. The secondary characters were all pretty funny.All in all - this was a good movie and I don't consider the time I spent watching it wasted.Although, to be fair, my opinion may be jaded because I saw this on cable the other night.Perhaps, if I had spent [money] in a movie theater for the pleasure of the big screen and a tub of popcorn, I wouldn't be nearly so kind."
1,Worst Movie Involving Mt Climbing ever.. Into Thin Air a distant second,"The only interesting moment in this movie is the rock climbing scene in the begining where Dad insists that the Son cut him lose to save his kids.I am stunned Ed Viesters allowed himself to be part of this project. I mean, common, you copter up to 22k feet to start a climb? You would be unconcious in 10 mins. Trapped in a cravase? Well, bring up some nitroglycerin to get me out buddy... explode things above my head.OK.. one great line.... when the supplier mentions his girlfriend is ""French-Canadian. When she is Canadian, she can be quite nice. Today she is obviously French.""A complete waste of film and time..."
1,Awful...Makes Cliffhanger look like a Best Picture candidate,"This movie was terrible, and the special effects are about as advanced as 1980 or 1981. The acting, well it was worse than the story or the special effects. This was clearly the real Bill Paxton, and Chris O'Donnell has been lousy in anything I've seen him in. In fact, these guys make Lithgow and Stallone look like Best Supporting Actor and Best Lead Actor candidates for their work in Cliffhanger (and Cliffhanger as Best Picture). On top of all else I didn't like about this movie, it was absurd to think about the rescue team running around at 25,000 feet without even breathing heavy (yet the guys taking it easy waiting for them were wasting away of edema). If you want a mountain movie, go with K-2, or just rent Everest (Imax). At least they're based on real-life (the Imax version IS real-life), and provide a certain amount of inspiration to the viewing experience. Gosh, this one, was BAD!"
3,Vertical Limit... lands with a thud...,"Not being fond of heights to begin with, I found little reason to be twitching in my seat while viewing this one...After the disasterest beginning sequence the rest of the movie paled in comparison to other climbing thrillers in recent years like ""Cliffhanger"" and ""K2""... although backed by precision special effects in the action scenes... the story itself was too predictable and that is where the movie failed..."
1,Reprints of covers ... that's it,"I was quite dissapointed. This book is just a collection of covers. There are no additional material, early sketches, the process involved etc.Most of the covers are reproduced in smaller formats i.e. up to 4 covers cramped in a page. I thought thet each cover would occupy at least a page or reproduced in a larger format but sadly, this is not the case.It would be better if the cover art were produced in its original form i.e. no text or logos to deface it.On a positive note, there are some artists which I never thought have contributed a cover e.g. Dave Dorman."
2,plug didn.t fit,"I had to grind down male jack from wire from antenna before it would fit in my Siruis input jack. It was a pain.I was dissapointed size of the actual antenna was not bigger, but my reception seems to be OK."
1,Fell Apart in Minutes,"After receiving the product, I attempted to set up as directed. First off, one of the U-bolts wasn't threaded so was useless. Then when I connected the cable to the antenna, the entire connector came apart, exposing the mesh of wires and copper core. Also, now when I attach my original antenna to my radio, I get no signal at all. To top it all off, based on J&R Music World's policy, I get to pay for the shipping to send this piece of garbage back. Glad so many other people had luck with it."
2,Deception.,"Video - I was expecting to see the musicians play. The only thing I saw was semi-transparent squares of colour over musicians playing and different effects on the image.Audio - The audio isn't even in sync with the video wich screws up the whole DVD. The hi-hat sounds also pretty harsh at times and you can hear some distortion. The rest is ok, but nothing impressive.Conclusion - Its a shame that the artistic director tried to be fancy in a MUSIC DVD. Seriously, this hurts the performance way more than it enhances it. Its a shame not to be able to see such great musicians play. Buy the Ari Hoenig DVD instead."
1,Total Garbage,"Avoid this at all costs! First of all, you can only navigate in a TINY window within an annoying an unnecessary ""skin"". The maps are not detailed at all and it's annoying to have to zoom in and out with a button click (mouse wheel doesn't work) and the detail is EXTREMELY poor. Also, it works against you by having to move around in that tiny window. Don't waste your money!!! This is [bad] and we should expect better. I wonder if the folks at Rand McNally use their own software for navigation. Probably not."
2,Upsetting conclusion,"My son loved this toy! He got such a kick out of it, and we liked it as well. Because it was so handy we kept it in the car as a car toy for him. After a couple uses he started investigating the toy a bit more, including chewing on the eyes of the toy (which is very common, i'm finding!) and the paint scraped off everywhere! He was covered in black & white paint chips only after a 1.5 mile ride to the grocery store! It would be a GREAT toy if it weren't for the paint hazard. He hasn't had the toy back since."
4,Good reading,I found that this book held my attention and left you wanting more and not able to put it down for long periods. A good author for those who are not true book worms like myself.
2,You get what you paid for.,"It's ok for the price - sound quality is not great, but about what I expected. Distorts audio badly on higher volume input, especially if batteries are getting weak.Worst part - battery cover is not very secure (for something that is designed for a bike ride) and loses connection frequently, I have to adjust it (actually loosen it) to make good contact."
3,Adorable hat - not the best quality,"The hat with the ears is adorable on. It was actually a bit too small for my 11 month old's head though, so we had to do some sewing, but it is supposed to be a snug fit - and it looks very cute. The quality isn't great, and will probably fall apart in the wash, so I will have to be super careful. The feet are huge, but maybe they are supposed to be worn with shoes under them. I would probably buy this again, but it's not worth $40. Maybe $20."
3,There are better,"Bought this on strong recommendation of my physical therapist. It works, kind of OK, but it's hard to keep in place. Instead, I bought a similar product made by Pro-Tech, also available on Amazon. Works much better, and even looks better."
1,Best to get at a local store,"These knee straps work fine but there is a lot of package information that you need to read BEFORE you purchase this, such as: do not use if you have poor circulation, etc. Also, at the time I purchased this, the sizing information was not available so the strap did not fit; I was allowed to exchange it or refund but I had to pay shipping and handling to receive it and to send it back and I was charged too much for the ""handling"". I have since noticed that these are available at most drug stores and you can avaoid all of the problems that I had."
1,Not enough compression,The strap didn't provide enough adjustable compression. I ended up going with a Nike that gave much stronger velcro for adjustability.
5,just right,"I got this for my six year old who had been carrying all his money around in his piggy bank- bit cumbersome. THis is a perfect size for him. It fits in the pocket of his pants - back and cargo. The velcro keeping it closed is secure and it has compartments for ""credit cards"" which he thinks is very cool. Very compact and sturdy."
5,"Well built, durable, still played with","I got this for my son, who was 14 months old at the time. He's 4 1/2 now, with an older sister and a baby sister, and the truck is still played with and still looking practically new. Nothing is broken or bent or missing, and all the lights and the helicopter's rotors still work. This thing has been dropped, stood on, thrown in toyboxes. I'm amazed how well it has stood up."
4,Excellent Reference on Systems Engineering,"Wasson's book provides a very complete review of systems engineering processes, procedures and terminology. I found the section on trade studies of particular value for developing aerospace applications. Sections on requirements analysis and specifications were also very helpful.[...]Content-wise the book is excellent."
4,NOT BAD AT ALL,"If you ask any fan of GAINSBOURG which songs they like best,chances are they they will have many sung by FRANCE GALL,BRIGITTE BARDOT,FRANCOISE HARDY,JANE BIRKIN,R?GINE,JULIETTE GR?CO etc.There are only a few duets featured in this collection.If you don't have anything from him,it is certainly a good overview of his career, even if i prefer the 3 cds DE GAINSBOURG ? GAINSBARRE.There is a booklet with a short biography,and each disc is in an enveloppe with a different picture of SERGE through the years.The famous HISTOIRE DE M?LODY NELSON a concept album ,is featured in it's complete version which is a good thing, but i wonder why they did not included L'HOMME ? TETE DE CHOU,another concept album that is only featured in a track.I ,like many enjoy best the early GAINSBOURG.In his last years,the autodestruction seems to have an effect on his oeuvre."
5,Entertaining and engaging,"My kids love BOZ. He is clean, decent, teaches values, and is even educational while teaching about faith. Wow. Excellent!"
4,Good budget printer,"For the money, this is a good printer. I purchased it over the Samsung CLP-510 because I got a better price at the time and didn't have a need for automatic duplexing (which is standard with the Samsung unit but not the Minolta).Works fine with Mac OS X.The problems with the 2430 DL:Cheap plastic: The output flap broke within a week. The input paper tray has an equally cheap and breakable flap.Paper jams: I've had multiple sheets pulled from the input tray at the same time. Also, I've had paper jam within the paper path. Perhaps using a different brand of paper would help alleviate these problems.Envelope handling: You must open the printer to switch between envelopes and regular paper. Toner will not adhere to regular paper sheets if you forget to restore the settings after printing envelopes."
2,Nothing but headaches,"Product creates smeary images which can be fixed by frequent cleaning of the laser lens.After 18 months of light use, as it gets older and dirtier inside, it begins to think that many of the color cartridges are not installed, rendering the printer incapable of printing. Have not found a solution.Printer makes loud clunking noises under normal use.Manufacturer's support web site is less helpful than most others I have tried.Pros- Good initial priceBottom line: avoid"
2,super size shadow man,"well not much to say about this movie or the performance.seens like all the newer seagal movie have no substance.all the story line does is jump from one scene to another,with no flow like some of the earlier movies.i would say,watch it on tv.and spend your money on a good older seagal movie."
2,OMG!!!! What have I done!!!!,I laughed. I cried. I kissed 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Who will mourn for my loss? Not the Shadow Man that's for sure.
1,Disappointing,"Boring book. I returned it. There was nothing in this book that inspired me to knit. I was expecting cute, unusual, colorful sweaters for adults similar to her childrens patterns. No such luck. If you have one or two books of basic adult sweater patterns you don't need this one."
5,"If you have little kids, and knit - get this book","A wonderful book of child and adult knitting patterns. Most of them knit up quickly and easily even while dodging a rambunctious toddler, or knitting with a sleeping baby in my lap. Now there's something rare, a book of kids knitwear you can knit while you still have kids! Lots of good patterns for beginners, and some slightly more complicated ones for those who get bored with straight stockingnet or garter stitch. I can't say enough good things about this book."
3,DONT JUDGE MITHGAR BY THE IRON TOWER,"The Iron Tower is the first book in a long and popular series. The author readily admits that he was greatly influenced by Tolkein (and what modern fantasy writer wasn't, in some capacity or another?). McKiernan's writing is slightly simplistic in this first book, but it is a good story and it is worth the read. The rest of the Mithgar books do get better as the world of Mithgar and the other planes are better developed and the history of the world is written and explained. Don't overanalyze the book, and don't judge all of the books by this first one. You also have to get past the first bit, because it does seem at first that it is blatantly copied from Tolkein. I promise, it's worth the read, if only to establish the setting for the other 12 or so books in the series."
4,Very good!,"Just from glancing through this book, I could see that it was very well-structured and -selected. I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars because it was a gift for a friend, so I never actually read it, but it had all the makings of a great volume. I also hesitate to rate it higher because in not reading it, I couldn't tell if the political bias would be skewed one way or the other. Even though they are Blair's own speeches, the editor might have chosen certain speeches/essays over others in order to give his subject a certain image."
4,private,"I do not mind rating the efficiency of the service you provide but there are some ""products"" that I am not comfortable qualifying based on how much I, or any recipient, ""liked it."" I would prefer if this system of rating were not mandatory, and all inclusive."
5,Soooo Helpful,"To any of you out there who are looking for a way out, TRY THIS!! I have tried lots of things, even therapy, but nothing has worked as well as this book. Especially helpful for those who need structure. Provides a day by day 3 week guide to stoping the binge/purge cycle. I found it extremely helpful."
5,Insightful,"This book is not only a wonderful resource for sufferers of bulimia. But it is also a resource for thier family and friends. The book explains bulimia, tells Lindsey Hall's personal story, and has a special chapter for family and loved ones. Everyone who suffers from bulimia or has a spouse, family member, or friend with bulimia, should read this book."
1,Should Have Been Titled Warren Zanes by Warren Zanes,"I was hoping for a track by track analysis of Dusty's classic album, and was led to believe that's what I'd be getting. Good writing, but not what I was looking for. I'm disappointed."
5,Dusty done right,"I greatly enjoyed this read. As a matter of fact, I allowed it to slow down my other reading. The book is well-written, and I learned some deeper details that I didn't know. Dusty in Memphis is the first book in the series, and it is a book that I will own for a long time. If you love music, Dusty Springfield, and the Memphis sound then this book is definitely for you. I recommend it highly, and it does have some interesting insights into the Southern perceptions, and the actual way that living in the South is. A great read, a good price from Amazon, and a good time to be had. It's kind of sad when you finish a book this good."
5,Hermosos Boleros interpretados por cantante de primera,"I enjoy Alejandro Fernandes music very much. His voice in my personal opinion has become world class at this point in his career. Unfortunatley this cd made earlier in his career isn't up to his current standard. Another thing that isnt as good as ide expect is the quality of the recordings. Other than that, the songs are old favourites sung as the album suggests ""a la manera de Alejandro Fernandez"". I highly recommend this album to anybody that appreciates beautiful melodic music regardless of the language you speak, and for the price you cant beat it.I enjoyed it very much and will continue to enjoy it. You wont be disappointed."
4,And beautiful Kentucky too,"This is a wonderful compilation of short stories, many of which i had already read in Shiloh. The common thread that i found is that the characters in these stories mean well, but are slightly clueless in this business of life. Here you have Leroy, whose life is disintegrating in front of his eyes, or Sam, who looks back at his long life not understanding how some things happened, or Nancy, wondering how she ended up so far away from home. But there's something very endearing about these people, in most cases illiterate, living in the periphery of middle class. A very enjoyable read."
2,I thought it's Corelle Ultra...,"These plates are not what I have expected based on the reviews here. When the box came, i looked first at the bottom of the plates, looking for the Ultra sign. As Corelle Ultra are more thicker and they are break and chip resistant. What I got are thin plates that looks very cheap. They are made in China and not USA. Look at the other reviews with low ratings, they are 100% correct with the design. they have dull and blurred colors. I don't know but the cherry blossom design looks old and faded.I ordered two sets as a gift for my parents this Christmas. I'm afraid that my parents would be disappointed too. I want to return them. But the hassle of sending it back makes me think twice."
1,"the design is blurry , colors are fated","i really liked the design online, but once i received the set ,i liked that it's very light but the colors were fated and the design is very blurry .. returned it the next day"
4,Pretty nice,"The large plates are huge! Great for men and others with big appetites. The salad plates are slightly smaller than our old dinner plates so they are the perfect size for my meals. I love the pattern and shape. The cups are porcelain and have a slight square appearance which goes well with the square plates. I wish the cups were made out of the same material as the plates though. I have children and grandchildren in and out a lot, getting drinks and such. I'm always afraid they'll grab one of the new cups and it will get broken."
3,Average,"The plates are very pretty. Unfortunately, not the quality I was looking for. The plates and bowls are very thin. Every time I handle them I am afraid they are going to break. None have broken yet, though."
1,so disapointed,"I read the review then I decided to buy them.I realy like corelle dinner ware so I am looking for to get them but I got the set of one bowl broken. Immedeatly I retured it and they sent me back replace item so quick but,,,it was also broken one. I could not belive it but I thought They never check the stock and deliver me maybe same one I retuned. This time I order refund. Now I realy think never buy any brakable item from amazon anymore."
4,How to Prepare for the AP Spanish (Book and Compact Discs),My CD didn't want to work.... But it was useful.... I got 16 credit hours in Spanish for college.... But keep in mind that my first language is Spanish.....
2,shaving cream,"I had no problem with the seller...That was perfectly fine. But, after using Crabtree & Evelyn shaving cream, this was a disappointment..."
2,Easy for Men and men but hard for Women.,"We played with gave with 8 family members, four men and four women. All the men had any easy time answering the questions for the women. On the other hand, the questions for the women to answer were ridiculous. The men themselves did not know the answer to about 60% of the questions.Despite that, we had fun playing the game. What makes it fun are your players."
3,Just...o.k.,Played it once with two couples and we put it back in the closet. The ladies of the group felt that the questions were extremely bias in favor of the men.
1,SUCKS!!!,"Wow i thought this game would be fun. Thumbs down on that one. This game was terrible. The females had a much eaiser time anwsering the questions the males were asking. The males however had the worst time answering the questions the females asked. Even the females didnt know the answers to some of the questions they were asking us. All in all this game was really boring and all it incited was complaints from the males because we couldnt answer ANYTHING correctly. Maybe we are just stupid...but im sorry, the average male does not know who the first female cosmetic company was..or what Creme Ferechashsadh (something French..i didnt see the spelling) is...final verdict...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! TOTAL WASTE! Stick with Cranium...much better game! Durability is 5...considering as many reviewers felt..this will remain in the box from here on out."
3,"Not the greatest, but it's okay.","We bought this game for an annual party, after playing ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" last year, and really liking the idea of another guys versus the girls game. This is no Mars/Venus. Though most of the questions were okay, the women at our party began to boycott after one too many fishing questions. On the other side, some of the questions that the men were supposed to answer, the women wouldn't have known the answer to had they not been provided with it. We threw out the wild cards because this wasn't exactly a couples party and they were somewhat provacative in nature. All in all we ended up making up our own rules (as we did with Mars/Venus) and made the best of it. I would not recommend this to be played with a group (30+) of people. Maybe in a smaller setting it might come off better."
3,not bad,"good for beginners and gives you a good background on the subject. no color images, all in black and white."
3,sucks,This movie is about people who go to a trpoical island to film there two surfers but this movie has a bad plot and the salt water crocodile looks very fake and computer animized It is all true take my advice and dont buy this movie to watch bad characters and a really fake croc!!!!!!!!
2,toy,"Do not be foold thes is nothing like the Perfect Grade Strike gundam, it is mearly a High Grade model, unlike the PG Strike Gundam model it's movement and poses are very limited and dose not featur the detail or intricacy of it's PG counterpar, therfor i canot recomend this product to any serius Gundam model collector.I will however recomend this to any body who wish's to give or have a nifty toy (or aquier all three of the ""Strike Packs""), note the ""strike packs on this kit are not compatible with the 1/60 Scale PG Strike Gundam."
3,Not what was expected,"I bought this thinking that I was going to get a collection of John McDermott folk songs, but was disappointed to find it was a collection by multiple artists."
5,In Their Own Way,excellent. informative. as a homeschool parent I agree with many of his suppositions.
3,May not get all your cookies,"I ordered a large amount for a corporate contest and they arrived quickly but in separate shipments. The product itself is very fresh and tasty; however there were two packages that had the cellophane broken and only 11 cookies in the box, not 12. I make lots of purchases through Amazon, but will most likley not make a food purchase again."
5,HP Photosmart C4180 All in One Printer/Scanner/Copier,I love it! Price was just right and the ink cartridge price is also reasonable.
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"This printer was a great deal when I purchased it, but quickly caused me more trouble than it was worth. It printed great photos, was fairly easy to operate, and I liked it most of the time. However, it frequently did not want to work, caused my computer to lock up, and jammed. Then, after only having it for less than 90 days, it just quit working at all. Though this may be just a bad model, I will never own another HP product again."
2,Scan quality is a problem,"I agree the printer looks nice... nice size... easy installation... no problem scanning... until... I had to scan a newspaper article for a client. At 200... I could not read the type... at 300... still could not read the type... at 600 still could not read the type. Finally, I switched to my husband's Epson and got great quality on the first scan. So.. I am now on my way to return the printer/scanner and order an Epson instead."
4,Three years and counting,"When I purchased a new computer three years ago, this printer came with it. It is the first all in one (minus a fax machine) that I have ever owned. We use it heavily and have since we got it. With four kids, one of which is in high school and another in middle school, this printer gets used daily. We combat heavy ink usage by printing everything but very important papers and pictures on the economical printing setting. It still prints beautifully on that setting.We have never had a paper jam, it has never locked up, and we have never had ink spillage. My youngest son (who is now four) has climbed up on it many times as if it is a stool, still no issues (not that I recommend that).I love the fact that it is a copier as well as a printer and a scanner. It is so convenient, and should this one break I would purchase this same one as the replacement. The only real downside is that it does not have a separate tray to hold what has been printed. It is not a deal breaker for us."
1,A TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD PRINTER!,"This is one of the worst HP products that I have bought in 13 years! It is flimsy, has no output tray and the photo paper feed jams. Even the HP technician told me that, for the money, I should upgrade to the 5100 series - which I did. For $50 more my HP 5180 is conversely the best HP product that I have ever bought -- and an elegant compliment to my new iMac 24""."
1,My replacement model is ALSO screwed up.,"This thing is the WORST. It only connected properly on and off for the first month or so, then I moved and lost my software disc; then I returned the danged thing, they replaced it (due to my profuse whining) and sent me another. I ordered a new software disc, just installed it and found out the cartridge holders (??) on this replacement version are misaligned. I am going to take a sledge-hammer to this waste of plastic and go OFFICE SPACE on it. I have never had problems with a printer before - somebody point me to a field ..."
3,Nice printer that is expensive to run,"I got this printer as a gift from my employer. Functionally, it's a very nice printer, scanner and copier and I was very happy with it unitl I ran out of ink. The HP 98 b/w cartridge it uses has a capacity of only 11 ml (HP 56 is 19 ml). It does not take too many pages of printing to use it up. Office Depot does not make any remanufactured ink cartridge for it and you have to pay full price for the HP original.It may be an inexpensive printer to buy but it is an expensive one to keep."
5,Very cute puzzles,"My daughter loves to do jigsaw puzzles and has no trouble doing puzzles with 25 pieces. These puzzles come in a little wooden box with lid and inside has four separate spots for the four separate puzzles. Each puzzle is stamped on back with a different shape so keeping them separate is a bit easier (at least for the parents). She likes them but I have to separate the puzzle pieces because she just don't have the patience to do so and sometimes when the lid is closed some puzzle pieces will move from one section to another. Overall, its a well made puzzle that should get many years of use (unless you have a dog who loves to chew on wooden things)."
2,Problems with Melissa & Doug Products,"As with all of the Melissa & Doug products, the kids like them very much, but they are not well made. The paper on the front of the puzzles often isn't glued on well & therefore rips. Also the wood and cardboard on the puzzles breaks easily. These products don't last."
2,the show is Charmed has the author seen it?,ok i've only read like a lil of it and almost done and i was like 'man the author should get the real facts!' and so i read the lil part in the back of the book that said about the author and it said she never misses an episode of charmed and i was like well then that's one lie.
3,Informed Politics Not a Synonym for Deceit,"If the reader can ignore the inflammatory title of this book, she will find much good information about the political climate and world events leading up to the ""Day of Infamy.""One would think our knowledge that President Roosevelt used politics to prepare the US for an inevitable war would enhance our opinion of his leadership. Did FDR know that Japan was going to attack US interests? An easy, ""yes."" It is clear that the President may have been surprised only by the location and the intensity of the first Japanese strike. But is this really a shocking insight?Read this book for facts about FDR's time but form your opinions by paying attention to world events and using commone sense!"
3,Good but missing Bass.,"The sound quality is good, but if you are a bass lover, it will muffle bass and the vocal frequency. Treble seemed to be okay though. It did make a squeaking noise when turning in the player. Didn't test it long enough to test out durability. Recommend it if just using for quiet listening."
1,Unhappy!,"I have been grossly disappointed in this product. The main reason being, the connector is wobbly and loose when connecting to iPod touch and thus sound is full of static, uneven and unpleasant. I have to constantly fidget around to get clear sound of my music. I chose this over other mp3 adapters based on the reviews, but needless to say, it was a bad choice."
5,Great.,This adapter works perfectly. Awesome for 35 cents plus shipping. Replaced my old one. I will buy again when this thing messes up because these adapters always mess up sooner or later.
2,Not Worth It,"The sound quality is not good. I used it once and couldn't take the poor audio. I bought this because the cheaper one I bought previously had poor sound quality, but this more expensive one is no better. Save your money for a radio that comes outfitted with the proper connectors."
2,The Harlequin Romance Novel of Fantasy,"Unless you are a fan of romance novels I can't believe you'll enjoy reading this book. I have read several other novels that successfully blend romand and fantastic literature so that fans of both enjoy the book - this is not one of them.From the overwrought prose to the heavily telegraphed ""climactic"" revelation of the villian this book was a huge disappointment. I have nothing against a little bit of bodice-ripping in my reading but this really over did it.However, if you like your women basically witless and hopelessly naive, you may enjoy this book."
2,"Informative, But Terribly Dry","The translation is incredibly hard to read, with no pattern to the text and sadly thread-bare quality to the language itself. This reads like an astute yet uninspired translation by an academic writer. The tranliterations are a bit out-of-date (Athena as Athana, for example).Admittedly, Bowra suggest that Pindar himself is hard to read. There is evidence for this in the subject matter of the poems: Pindar covers enormous depth in small space.There are notes at the end of every poem, which, for me, are preferable to endnotes. One learns more than expect about the life of a lyric poet: Pindar's movements from city to city and his expectation of payment for poetry.I would not recommend this translation to a friend."
4,Great book,I am taking a meditation class along with the reading the book. I am sleeping better and feel more at peace. It has been a great investment.
5,All The Days Of Her Life,"I would recommend this book for anyone who likes to read because I think it have a lot of information about Diabetes. For example, the book tell you how it can be controlled, in specific it said that people with Diabetes have to take insulin shots, they can drink alcohol, they have to have a diet. ""Too many empty calories"" her friend Terri said. My second reason is because the novel shows the relationship between friends. For example when Lacey and Katie fight and then they became best friend again. ""I'm sorry, about our fight on the phone when you called me at the hospital. You were right about everything you said."" I also learn that we all have to accept our selves like we are and not try to be somebody else. So if you want to find more about Lacey and Jeff, please feel free to read this book."
2,Annoying Till the End,"This book, All the days of her life, is the most annoying book I've ever read. Lacey is the most annoying character. All I wanted to do while reading this book was yell, ""Open your eyes! You are a diabetic! Deal with it!"" Lacey's passage through fitting in with the ""In"" crowd with diabetes is a very, very irritating story. I would not recommend this book. I cannot understand why anyone would like it."
4,A must-have for die-hard Coop fans.,"I enjoy Coop's artwork. I don't have any Coop-inspired tattoos or examples of his work posted up around the house, but I think his style is visually stimulating (even without the sexual themes) and just plain fun. To me it screams 'cool' and takes me to a 'political correctness free' time of hot rods and pulp magazines.The Big Fat One is, like it's title states, quite a thick sketchbook. It's acually quite a bit smaller in height and width than I was expecting, but it's far thicker than I imagined. There are numerous fun sketches in there, including sketched versions of popular Coop works. I just wish there were some finished color prints included...but I understand that this is not what this book is about. Overall, I'd say it's a quality publication, just be aware that's it's all black-and-white sketches and not much else.-C.R."
5,No-mess Tylenol formulation,"This is a good advance over the liquid form, because it can be given to the kid when lying down, with no risks of spills.One tablet gives 160 mg of medication, for a kid from 24 to 35 pounds; two tablets are for a kid from 48 to 59 pounds."
3,Good rack...terrible hardware,"The hardware that they supply is cheap and I don't recommend using as they are cheap and aluminum rather than steel. As a result I couldn't turn the Allen bolt making it unsafe. So I had to drill them off and replace so that it felt safe for my kid to be on the back. Other than that, the rack is fine and is compatible with the copilot kids seat."
2,Throw away the hardware,"I wrote this review offline, but I see Gary Grossman has already covered much of the same ground. The safest thing to do with this product is probably to find matching size hardware somewhere, then throw away everything that came in the box.This says the hardware is stainless steel but as far as I can tell it's made of tin. I have already stripped the screws using only my hands and the little allen wrench that comes with the kit. I had a long tedious job getting the unit off the bike using a vise grip as a wrench. I'm taking the unit back to the store, as I still have a nut/bolt combo that is stuck...not sure what I want them to do about it. I've already wasted a lot of time. This is a little feature but it's a deal-breaker. I won't buy anything made by this company again. I'm giving it two stars rather than one because the rack itself is quite strong and lightweight."
1,Bogus product -- did not work.,"I was too hasty in handing this package over to my bike shop (was getting a new bike and wanted this mounted during assembly). It appears that my product was bogus (albeit very well constructed). Unfortunately, my CoPilot child seat would not slide onto the rack (rails were too thick). By the time I realized this, my 30 days for return had expired. It was then that I studied the design carefully and realized that it was not a true Blackburn EX-1. My neighbor's Blackburn actually has ""Blackburn"" embossed in the metal.If you order this, study it carefully and, especially if you plan to use it for a child seat, make sure it works before you mount it and throw away the package."
4,Almost perfect,"This product would be rated ""5"" if it were not for the constant pop-up indicating that it is low on ink. I have two HP printers that do this -- right after changing the cartridge the pop-ups begin. HP was contacted and could not assist me in solving the problem.Aside from the low-ink pop-up, the printer/scanner/copier works great -- very good quality -- much better than our previous Lexmark. A little slow but, for the price, I would highly recommend it."
2,Not Recommended,"I was so disappointed with this printer's performance that I finally just threw it out the window. I've had it for a few months now and when it wants to work it does an okay job but about 50% of the time it won't cancel or delete print jobs. When you restart your computer it decides to print the job you tried to delete the day before. It decides to go through an ""alignment"" process and print out a color sheet every time the ink cartridges are adjusted. If you decide to cancel the alignment it still prints fine but it tries aligning on its own anyway."
2,Good printer with poor ink life,"Purchased this printer in September of the year and quite pleased with all-in-one printer,copiers,scanner feature. It came out handy when needed.But to my surprise, after printing 30-35 pages in black & white it started giving me error that your B&W; ink is running out. It was also reflecting the same in printout quality ! I called HP sales as well as technical dept , and they came back with answer (after 55mins) that ""as inc cartridge came with the printer it would be off lower quality & life than the one purchased separately"", they won't be able to do much in that.Though I am struggling to fight with HP as well as credit card company, there is less in my control. Just sharing with you to make sure you are aware about this fact while purchasing."
1,sub standard,"i have had no end of trouble with this printer, and i did not pay 39.99 for it either.after almost a year of having only the printing function work i was able to resend it to hp. it worked a month but then had to put it in storage due to katrina. when i resurrected it, it only printed, again and then finally stopped doing that. have had it up and printing/scanning, not copying since august and yesterday, it just quit. i got a new cartrige but that was not the solution. heap of junk. totally unreliable. don't waste time or money of any kind on this one."
4,"prints beautifully, tiny cartridge","Just finished a print job, 400 pages, plus address labels. NO paper jams at all. my previous HP Deskjet would have jammed, especially with the labels. This printer prints beautifully, it is fast even with color. But HP now packages the ink in such tiny cartridges that you WILL run out quickly. Keep a cartridge on hand, but enjoy the speed and quality of this printer."
3,Just ok,I got this free from HP with a computer. The printing and scanning functions are ok but definitely not as good as my Canon and Epson printers and scanners. It also uses ink quickly.
4,Just what I was looking for,"I am very pleased with my HP Deskjet F380 all in one. It prints clearly and the colors are vibrant! This was definately a great buy for me and my family and a great asset to my home office. I am not very IT savy, but I was able to connect this to my pc with no problem."
3,Acceptalbe but not a great investment.,I got this free from HP when I bought a computer. I suspect HP sells these printers so cheaply because they make bigger money selling you ink.I haven't had any problems with it - software or performance. But it's just adequate. After making 10 copies the ink indicator was at 2/3. It really only scans marginally well. If you want it for color scans or pictures take time to research better printers.HP makes good moderate-use printers and this is one.
2,You Can Do Better,"Con:1. Jams every 2-3 print jobs. Requires a lot of time and TLC to keep it running.2. Software incessantly hounds you to waste ink on unnecessary ""alignment"" pages, whether or not you've recently installed a new cartrige.Pro:1. Fast print speed, for the price, when it's working. Unfortunately, this benefit is negated by #1 above.2. Has never jammed due to paper misfeed. The frequent jams don't waste paper, at least.Bottom line:This is not the upgrade I thought it would be from my old Lexmark cheapo. I thought the HP brand assured me of higher quality and performance than Lexmark, so I was willing to pay a higher price for the HP. Now I wish I had my old Lexmark back, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on the F340."
3,"It works fine, but not amazing","I've had this printer for maybe 3 years or so. It works great. What I mean is, it does what its supposed to do, print. Print quality isn't amazing, dont print pictures on it. It uses a crap-ton of ink. They make a KILLING off of ink. If you can find a printer that saves on ink, get something else. (At least I send them back in to recycle, what a waste of cartridges). Other than that, it works great with my Mac Pro."
4,Very good printer,"I was very pleased with the installation procedures once customer service directed me to turn off my firewall (the firewall apparently caused the installation to fail on the first attempt). I continue to be pleased with the printer overall, but would prefer that printing multiple pages printed in sequential order (print pages 2-3 prints 3 then 2; I want page 2 to print first and page 3 to print second)."
4,Reliable printer and a good value,"I have been very happy with my HP F-380 All-in-one pritner. The set-up was very easy. You do need to remember to buy a USB cable since it is not included. Black and color ink cartridges were included. The printer, scanner and copier software is easy to use. The quality of the print has been very good for black & white and also color documents. I have not printed any photos, so I can't comment about the feature."
2,Disappointed!,"This game was a big disappointment to our family. The rules were too complicated and it took way to long to play, most of the players lost interest long before completing the game. It was only played twice."
4,Presenting Murdering by Funny Way,"This is a first movie I notice Kelly in, and he performed in Hollywood much prior to other talents of Afro-America, surely.Relaying on personal physics rather than on contemporary sci-fi tricks, film impresses with the funny presenting of the murdering unstoppable."
1,Waiting A Long Time,"I first saw this movie on VHS back in the early 90s. It was so horrible, I remember my buddy and I were almost sick with laughter. Many reviews talk about the bad editing job on the DVD - but I remember the VHS version being just as horrible, which made the movie even more halarious. I'm sort of glad the swearing & nudity are gone so that I can show this sad piece to my son. I can't wait to see the jet-pack scene with his afro-fitted helmet."
5,Become The Star You Know You Are,"At last! A self improvement book that's fun-not only to read but to implement. Nozizwe casts a new light on Hollywood metaphors that make you the star of your own show. From decorating your own set to dressing the part to creating a fan club, Nozizwe's approach puts your desire to be the best you can be on center stage.Her suggestions are not only fun and imaginative, they're practical and affordable too. She encourages you to dream big and not settle for less than your heart says you deserve. I especially enjoyed the anecdotes and quotes that Nozizwe uses to illustrate how the rich and famous got that way.Reading this book is like a mini vacation. It will fire up all your creative chromosomes and inspire you to create the kind of life you've always dreamed of."
5,Great Doll!,"Love these UglyDolls! We bought this one for our god-daughter. Only one thing -- this doll is a blend of pink and purple, not the white the pictures appears to be."
3,Radio was missing a part,"This radio arrived with a selector dial missing: the one for selecting AM. I had to remove another dial from the radio and replace the missing one with that, which still left a dial missing. So the radio is incomplete, which is unsatisfying. It's not enough of a headache to justify repackaging and re-mailing the radio to return it. But I'm left wondering what happened to the missing dial. Did someone pilfer it? Did it fall off at the factory? Or did an employee at the line of assembly turn and sneeze at the precise moment my radio arrived for inspection? Food for thought!"
2,Product Failed,"The radio was larger than I expected. So be clear about the size of the radio you want before you order it. When the radio arrived, I put in batteries. It did not work. I then used the AC adapter, pluged it in and turned it on. The radio started to smoke and I pulled the plug. The radio never did work and I have returned it."
2,I guess everyone else likes it ... Why don't I ??,It seems like the majority of buyers like this model so I guess I am in the minority. When I first received it and unwrapped it it really looked sweet. Then I started playing with the knobs and realized how extremely cheesey they were. The felt like they were going to break off. I tuned it to FM radio and was not impressed with the reception nor the sound. The shortwave band was also very disappointing. Maybe it's just me and I don't know what I am doing (possible) but it didn't trip my trigger. I had to return it. Seemed like a steep price for just a so/so radio. One thing I really do like is Amazon. They really do all they can to make you happy.
2,There is better out there.,The real draw back to this radio is the it has a manual tuner. If you change a band the tuning must be re-tuned. I suspect it is a old style string and pulley style. Reception is good not great. Sound quality is very good with room filling sound. If you listen to 1 station this is a great radio. If you are a station flipper get used to spinning the dial.
1,100$ hunk of plastic.,"Pro:Looks niceSounds goodCons:** Analog tuner drifts like crazy **No Single Side BandNo external inputsMade entirely of plasticPower button defaults to sleep timerNo frills in the box (SW antenna, etc)Spend the extra 30$ and get a Sony ICF-SW7600GR."
4,"Bit twisted plot, but still lots of fun","I've hosted my own murder mysteries and I've used this one three times with three different groups of people. The CD can be customized so after you play it the first time you can print out new clue books for new people. The plot is a lot of fun but you have to ignore the exceedingly obvious clue if you use the real names of people. Otherwise, get friends who are not afraid to talk and question and have a good time. This one tells the murder who he/she is at the beginning and only the murder can lie. All the other reviews about these games explain how to play and how much fun they are. This plot is not too terrible, more suitable for older audiences."
3,Good,"This seat is great for the price. I really don't have a huge complaint, just that you have to get used to having such a smaller seat. It's relatively comfortable and I haven't gone any great distances yet, but I'm sure it would pay off. Overall, it is a great seat for the price."
2,of moderate value,"The base premise for this book is correct but it lacks sufficient development. Facts need to be checked more closely, ie Beslan. The authors take a subject that does need serious attention and give it a gloss over, granted we do not wish to hand terrorist a play book, but the book should be more detailed on terrorists group, mindset."
5,"Outstanding, must read book","This is an absolute gem! It's my second most recommended book this year afterThe Joy of Living: Unlocking the Secret and Science of Happiness. It is an easy read - with short, inspiring quotes on most of the pages, and combined with meditations on healing emotions/attitudes such as forgiveness, lovingkindness, compassion and peace. Thank you, Jack Kornfield for producing this phenomenal roadmap to the spiritual life."
4,Resident Squirrels love it!,"While it is definitely NOT totally squirrel proof it is effective at slowing my little guests down. They have managed to figure out how to get at it from the side. I've hung it at different levels and distances away from branches but they just consider it a challenge. I really don't mind now that I don't have to refill the feeder every week. It's pretty funny to watch them contorting to get to the seed. And I do think they are pretty cute. Also, they handle it roughly and so far it looks like it's still in good shape. I've had it out in the garden for over a month."
1,Not squirrel proof,It took about 2 days for my local tree rats to figure out how to defeat the mechanics of this feeder; about the same time as it took the birds to get used to it.
2,No agile squirrels allowed,"I needed to entertain my cat with a feeder that wouldn't be mangled by a local hooligan squirrel. This feeder, while sturdy overall, only lasted about 4 weeks because the hooligan figured out how to leap up, hang on and bend the hinges in a way that eventually broke them. Disappointing. If I didn't have this problem I would have been happy. It held 2 weeks worth of feed for the songbirds."
1,not squirrel proof,"I was just out looking at my Squirrel Proof Bird Feeder and there was a squirrel hanging off the side reaching in the tray and enjoying the birdseed. A little while later, I saw a RAT hanging off the side doing the same thing. Very dissatisfied and disappointed! These Texas rodents are too smart!"
4,Not quite squirrel proof,"Perhaps here in western NC we have a few very determined squirrels that refuse to understand what squirrel proof means. This feeder has cut down tremendously on who visits it, but there are two who can get up there no matter where I place it. I can foil them for a day or two (rubbing the tallest pole I could buy with Vaseline really helped.) I feel like the crazy lady on a U Tube video (running out and yelling at squirrels all morning) My next step is to add something to the feed. I tried the pepper but they never even noticed they were supposed to hate it. Another disadvantage is the only birds that seem to enjoy it are the smallest ones. Cardinals, jays, doves etc don't seem to be able to eat from it. That said, it really cut down a whole lot of squirrels gobbling up the food and swarming in my yard in a disgusting manner. It has gone down to just two squirrels from what seemed like a pack that could empty a feeder in 48 hours."
2,Smarter Squirrels,"I have two of these feeders. All I can say is that my squirrels must be smarter than the squirrels the manufacturer tested this feeder with (or should I say ""the squirrels with which the manufacturer tested this feeder""). My squirrels sit on one side (closing that side to the seed) and reach around to the other side and help themselves. The manufacturer might consider connecting the two side closing mechanisms with a gear so if one side closes, the other closes with it."
1,Poor Quality Construction,"Mine arrived with rivets popped out and the steel where the birds sit is thin and flimsy. I returned this product, and would not recommend it."
2,Confusing to birds,I got this feeder so that larger birds such as cardinals could feed at my feeders. This is hanging alongside a tube feeder. The birds hop over to this feeder and first try to peck at the food they see through the plastic side. Then they must smell the food at their feet and try to peck at that. The bar that they stand on is so close to the food they have a hard time getting their heads under the little protective lid without slipping back. It does keep the food dry and it is amusing to watch our resident squirrel try to get at the food.
3,Doesn't last,"I've used Dove and never had any issues, but I wanted to try a more ""natural"" deodorant like this one. The label claims ""all day odor protection"" but it hasn't worked all day for me. Also, I made the mistake of applying it right after shaving--big mistake! It irritated my underarm so badly, that I had to wash it all off."
4,Lots of fun,Our group had a good time solving this mystery; I was surprised that there are only 6 core characters (with 2 extras) as opposed to many other brands we have played where there are 8 main characters.
3,Game for Adults~good time.,"Great for adults. Only can use one time, unless you photocopy the invites to enable you to host more than one party."
3,I have yet to be able to play through the whole way.,"I thought this would be a fun game to get and it would end up being like clue. However, I think really you are just paying for a audio CD with 4 tracks and 6-8 books for players to play as a characters. We started this game once but everyone was pretty wasted and wanted to play something that didn't involve as much role playing. I am not sure how the story ends on the CD but I am pretty sure once you know the murderer you cannot play the game again without knowing who is the murderer. Hence not much replay value."
3,Doesn't work with car antennas,"Like most people installing the Sirius radios outside, I discovered that using the car antenna that came with the kit actually works better than the directional home antenna (and it's low profile to boot).Be aware that this cable doesn't work with the car antennas since they're usually shaped like an L. It will only work if your antenna end is straight. Not sure why this wasn't disclosed in the description.Also, regarding waterproofing. The instructions say to install it in a specific direction. It looks like if installed in that direction there would be no way for water to get into it. If installed upside down, it would fill with water.Other than that it works."
1,Warning. Very dangerous design flaw,"I am very concerned about the safety of this Britax/Regal Boulevard Seat. I had the seat for just over a month and I found my child seated with the straps loosened and completely off his shoulders four times after our journey home. I finally figured out that he just pulls on the quick release tap in front of him (under a cloth flap) and leans over; thus loosening the straps with the utmost ease. He is 3 years 1 month old.Thank God I was not in an accident during the 4 times his straps were off his shoulders!!!!Other than this ""flawed"" design feature, I find the seat quite nice given your car has ample rear seat space. However I feel compelled to give warning about the dangerous ""child accessible quick release"" of this seat and must give this seat the lowest rating possible."
5,"have used this product in the past, will continue","Have used this product for the past 5 years, and it works great on spots on my rugs..ran out of it andnow have reordered it...same product, same results, works great for spot removals."
5,"Tried them all, this was my last resort!","I've tried a ton of different products, even ordering a stain remover for $20 from QVC. I saw this at Home Depot as it was literally the only one on the shelf I hadn't tried.My husband was skeptical, but I have a playgroup coming on Wednesday for the first time. We had recently steam cleaned but already our tan carpet was looking pretty bad. We didn't want to steam clean again as we are planning to tear our carpet up in a few weeks anyway. This stuff is amazing! You could literally see it dissolving the stain. Our dining room carpet, as you can imagine gets lots of stains. This stuff attacked them and got out even old stuck on things that the steam cleaner couldn't get out.On top of that, we did the like the bottle suggested and rubbed it in with our fingers, it didn't burn my hangnails and it didn't have an odor at all!Try it! Super cheap too!"
1,"12 strikes and you're out, Folex","I tried this on a dozen stains. Not only did it not remove any of them, they didn't even change in appearance. I honestly think this product is 99% water, .5% dishwashing detergent and .5% pink food coloring to make it look authentic.I feel like an idiot for buying into their ""instant stain remover"" claims."
1,"Whoa, Folex really *IS* magic!","I've tried a lot of carpet cleaners and after reading a few rave reviews, I was excited to try this product that was repeatedly described as ""magic"". I'm normally very level-headed and skeptical but after trying Folex, I truly believe in the supernatural! ***It really IS magic!*** It was just like a sorcerer, what with the way it conjured up large, blotchy discolorations where before there were only tiny, barely noticeable spots. Much like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, Folex pulled my security deposit right out of my account once my landlord saw the half bleached/half discolored circles. Obviously this product was created by some sort of Super Wizard because the Folex stains not only remained after shampooing (which happened to remove every single mark on the carpets not touched by this stuff) but the Folex stains actually got worse with time! Now that's an impressive spell that is sure to convince any non-believer!!!"
4,The illustrations are what make it,"If you can find this out-of-print, oversized hardback, it is worth collecting. The illustrators lovingly present a detailed birds-eye view of Vinci, the Sforza compound, changing designs of palaces, the scaffoldings which supported some of his bronze works, period clothing, Leonardo's proposed design for Milan and its canals, and much more. It's hard to find, but highly recommended."
1,Not so Great,"Overall the playing of the game was very enjoyable. The only real problem is with the solving of the case. Not to give anything away, but there is no way the players can actually solve this case and it is quite disappointing. We have played other versions of Murder Mystery party games and have had a better time because of the outcome."
4,Great Fun!! Need more interaction with extra guests.,"This was a ""Family"" event! It was great fun, people came dressed as characters and ""really"" got into the action. We used our own version of food, and ""dressed"" the garage in theme decorations,wine bottles with candels, music, checkered tablecloths etc. We took the suggestion and chalked in an outline of the dearly departed.Co-hosts dressed as ""The Dog, and Beth"" and were ""family"" friends. They were to escort the murderer to the police to avoid exposer to the ""family"". We used a date close to Halloween for this one.All the materials in the game were first rate!Two suggestions, #1-that the host NOT PLAY a part, and preview the CD ahead of time in order to assist their guests with questions. #2-Extra guests are left out of the action, need more characters to write in somehow. But over all, a great sucess and we will be planning the next one soon!"
3,Jin Shin Jyutsu,"The intent behind creating the video did not manifest. I was truly disappointed after reading about and talking with practitioners about this modality. The entire production needs to be re-vamped. The attire was inappropriate to provide accurate information. This system deals with specific points on the body. The presenter wore a suit with her hair down thus preventing the viewer from gaining any insight except general. The presenter would have been better to wear a white t-shirt with white stretch pants or pants while keeping her hair in a tight bun. In the alternative, to have had an assistant to show the points and manuevers. The video is amatuerish at best. Although I appreciate the effort, it was a waste of time, money and energy. I find it difficult to believe the producer or editor failed to comment on these inadequacies prior to the video's release. A true disappointment."
5,Family Heirloom,It's a family heirloom. I have no complaints. My Father is listed in this book. My Grandmother participated in this book's research. Priceless.
3,Attachment system unsatisfacory,This product is fine except for the attachment system. Steel bolts go thru the toilet rim into nylon nuts. These WILL NOT stay tight. After a week or two out comes the screwdriver to retighten because the seat is slipping laterally. I think this needs a nylon washer and a steel nut so it can be tightened better without stripping a nylon nut. Pretty poor engineering for an expensive product.
5,"Superior Sound, Low Price",Simply stated? Awesome.90% of people who buy these speakers are attracted to the colors I bet. But all will be pleasantly surprised by the quality they put out.I was so happy that I ended up buying the 2.1 Avengers and the 5.1 system.I probably saved a few hundred bucks at least.
2,It All DependsOn What You Want,"If you're a researcher in the field, or if all you do is design high-performance airthmetic circuits, it's probably a good book to have. But if you have a specific job to do, like implementing a ""mundane"" radix-2 SRT divider, this isn't the book for you. As another reviewer said (and I should have listened) the authors simply leave out far too many details. Keep looking ... there are better books out there!"
4,Interesting and overlooked,"With a style and physical appearance bearing more than a passing resemblance to that of Terence Trent D'Arby, Dupont is not nearly as musically gifted as TTD, but still lays down a solid set of groovy, funky R&B that has more of an ""organic"" feel to it than much of the black popular music of the period. Always positive and optimistic, with uplifting subject matter set against fresh, earthy beats, Dupont deserves some respect and certainly some rediscovery for this mature effort."
3,Looks like a great learning toy,"I purchased this toy as a donation to a family with a 3 year old. It looks like a fun toy that will help a child learn to write in a fun way. It won't be presented to the family for another weeks, so I have no idea how well it actually works."
3,Ehhh..,"At first the book was in an acceptable condition, after a while as I flip through more pages, it started tearing page by page. Reading it page by page was a pain because it was ripped but who cares now, I did well in my class. xD Thank you for good shipping :)"
5,Buy this video...don't waste your money on the current tour!,"The energy; the talent, and the humor are all on this video. Relax, take it easy...let Styx take you back to Paradise! This is a better value than the Styx parody that is on the road currently with the Brave New World tour (where you can hear Grand Illusion, Come Sail Away, etc. butchered). This is a QUALITY show on tape to view at your leisure. Have fun! You'll love it!"
2,"Four Real, it's a stinker","University Games has done it again. First, Battle Of The Sexes and now another mediocre trivia game with cockamamie rules. This one even has a weird bidding system that requires you to put static cling numbers on plastic poker-style chips (losing durability points right there... those numbers will be lost inside a week, I bet).Maybe it's not too late to return it?"
4,"Unorganized, but great info for students of pasturing poultry","So, the bad news first --- this book is really a compilation of articles from the magazine GRIT. Each chapter was written by a different person, which meant there were lots of different points of view (good) but also that you can't use it as a reference (bad). As a result, this book should be read straight through so you can take the conflicting bits of information with a grain of salt.The other downside is only applicable to backyard hobbyists. Nearly all the articles are written by commercial pastured poultry operators, which means there's less information applicable to those of us just raising eggs or meat for ourselves.All of that said, if you're searching for the best way to pasture your chickens, this book should be on your reading list."
3,Johny is no Ronnie !,"This is...well...a good DVD, a must for Skynyrd fans, but I was dissapointed by the way Johny V. Z. sings, he lacks the energy necesary for being a Lead Vocalist for one of the classic rock bands of all times. He looks childish and wimpy considering the band he plays in, you can sense that he really DOES NOT takes his role seriously.How sad is to notice that Artimus Pyle is missing in the drums, he was the beat of the heart of Skynyrd.But after all...it is worth buying, the two new guitarists really know how to play.But...wow... I can not believe how Rossington turned to be ... an overweight, emotionless guitar player, and the back up singers are not worth comparing with the originals that died in the plane crash.But after all, I repeat...a must for Skynyrd fans."
2,Diehard 70's Lynyrd Skynyrd Fan,"Forgive me, but I've tried SO HARD to feel the magic of the old Lynyrd Skynyrd towards the current incarnation. I've tried to like the ""new"" Lynyrd Skynyrd, but sorry, Jack...no can do. I'll stick to the tried and true. The original Lynyrd Skynyrd had heart and I can tell that the current band is playing the music for the money, not for the joy of it. Lynyrd Skynyrd, in essence, died on October 20, 1977. Let the old band rest in peace. Fly on free bird, you're free! I'll always miss you!"
3,short comings,I thought they were going to be a little more substantial in weight and compression. Too thin to wear to the gym with confidence...
5,Wish it was longer,Good tv show that was cancelled too soon. love nathan fillion in this and a young emma stone. Just wish there was more
4,Concise summary of all things ADHD,"This is a well presented summary of both diagnostic and treatment approaches to Attention Deficit Disorders. It will make a good introduction and guide for individuals struggling with this condition, as well as for the parents of such individuals."
4,"Easy reading but far from ""dumbed down""",This book is a very easy reading but packed with lots of information in a very well organized format. After having two different professionals ask me if I've ever considered ADD as a possible condition I figured it was time to learn some more. I love that the author calls out how ADD is about how the mind organizes. He has a balanced approach to medication. He believes in a multi-pronged approach of developing strategies to develop strengths and minimize the challenges of ADD.
3,Misleading,"Good read, some misleading doctor talk such as stimulants (Adderall) is not addictive. You got to read this book and filter thru some of the doctor/pro medicine bs. Not recommended for anyone not educated in medicine."
2,Seriously?,"Long on feeling, short on data. Seriously, blaming chemicals in our food for potentially inducing surging rates in ADD without a single statistic of data to back it up? That's the kind of sensationalist hippy hogwash I would expect from a former Playboy playmate, not an MD writing a guide for patients."
4,Driven But Then Delivered From Distraction,"Finally a book on how to deal with ADD. Enjoyed the practical and easy explanations which is a good read for those of us who do have ADD. Talk about hitting the nail on the head with descriptions of those of us who have ADD! Yes, and I even started reading the end of the book before I started at the beginning which is a habit we ADDers have as written in the book. The book is written so you can skip around the chapters without missing information. There is even a special chapter if you can't finish the entire book. I recommend reading this book for those who have ADD and those who have ADDers in your lives."
2,A bit on thin side.,"The 4x4 pads are a little thin to my liking. Had I needed a thicker pad I would have to make an additional purchase. These are find for cleaning or use on a smaller wound where you could fold the pad once or twice. Be prepared to use two or three pads if you are using on a larger wound. It's a good value, just don't expect a substantial piece of gauze."
5,Beautiful music.,"I really enjoyed this DVD!I've read some of the other reviews where they complain about the sound, but my copy had no problems at all. Everything was clear as a bell, & no synchronization issues.Sarah McLachlan has an incredibly beautiful voice, & she is a wonderful & talented live performer, & all of that was captured perfectly on this DVD!"
5,Mirrorball DVD is a must have,"Mirrorball is the first music from Sarah McLachlan that I have purchased. It was recommended to me by an old and very dear friend. ( Thank you Betsy ). I have enjoyed the DVD immensely. I was surprised that the equivalent audio CD doesn't contain some of the better cuts from the DVD; in particular ""I will not forget you"". The DVD is well produced and the sound quality is excellent. Sarah is quite a talented lady. The interview was also very good; a down to earth, low key sort of interview that reveals a lot about the artist. She ends the concert with ""Angel"", a soul soothing piece of music."
4,tons of extra materials but 5.1 quality was dissapointing.,"This dvd has collection of great songs. 'Adia', 'Sweet Surrender', 'Angel', 'I'll remember you' and etc. also it features lengthy interview section that really brings the artist close to the fan. it's got photo library and lylics and multi angles loaded with dvd features. Video quality was somewhat blurry but my focus was on the music, so it didn't bother me too much, until I realize 5.1 audio sounds muddy too. for some reason PCM sounds lot better than 5.1 mix. multi angle was kind of pointless since all three angles were edited to show different camera angles and takes away the viewers choice to focus on one camera. i think there is a navigation problem in interview section. once you start the interview chapter, you can't exit until it's over. fast forward freezes the scene and menu button doesn't bring up the menu.i have toshiba sd-3109. Other than technical difficulties, it's a great dvd featuring many beautiful songs."
4,a performance dvd,"This is a dvd of several performance that went onto the mirrorball cd. I love the cd and give that five stars but the dvd gets four, because it isnt the same. I felt like something was lost when i saw sarah performing on stage, like when a book is made into a movie, you cant just let your imagination do the work you can see it. But the dvd is still good, and fun to watch now and then, but the cd is far better. Also the dvd has performances of songs that arent on the mirrorball cd, which at first irked me but then was ok."
2,"Horribly edited, and painful to watch","I loved Sarah's Mirrorball album, and really looked forward to the DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD is beyond horrible, mostly because of the editing. Every few seconds they change the camera angle, with never a fade-in or fade-out. After the first few songs it literally became hard to watch. Many of the songs seem lip-synched, though it could just be a poor match-up of the video and audio portions. Even the interview with Sarah was tough to watch, with the camera person zooming in and out and bouncing around. Buy this DVD at your peril, but if you do, do yourself a favor and pick up some Dramamine while you're at it, you'll need it."
3,"Almost good. But not so good, for specialty applications","Packaged and mailed to me promptly via 2 day shipping. Quite Sad That I returned it because it just wasn't good enough for the work I do. Its seemed like it would've been a great product (at least on paper). But for measuring RPM It doesn't sample fast enough to display a fluid rpm readout. Measuring RPM is finicky. At idle display reads a jumpy 920-1800 rpm while digital tachometer is reading a steady 950-1100 rpm. Not accurate enough for me. The rate that its sampling is very low/slow. And for Motorcycle work were 50 rpm matters, it just doesn't cut it. I'll just stick with my GTC TA100 Smartach+ for accuracy."
1,Huh?,"Is it just me, or is this too complicated? My ""included with my light switch"" 10 cent test light saved the day when I wanted to check for 12 volts on my car's electric window motor. It's pretty, but the instructions leave something to be desired."
4,Great watch for the value,"The watch comes with a nice backpack from a promo. Works great and feels solid. Only complain I have is after adjusting the time/date it was very hard to tighten the adjustment screw back. Invicta mentioned that the watch will not be water-tight if this is not done correctly; however, they made it very hard to screw it back.Other than that I love this watch."
5,Great Watch,"This watch replaced a more expensive Seiko. I actually prefer this watch much more than I ever did my Seiko. The Invicta is a great looking, masculine, and easy to read watch that looks far more expensive than its real cost. This watch feels great and is secure on my wrist. The best thing I like about the Invicta is its ability to look great with no matter what I wear - from shorts to casual dress. You'll be very pleased with this well made watch!"
5,A throwback to the good ol' days!!!!,"A modern exploitation film that hits all the classic notes!!! Bikers, blood, boobs, beer, debauchery, bigfoot, fetus desecration, cheesy acting, classic one-liners! Can't wait for the sequel!!!"
4,Feels good so far..,"It does the job and holds nicely (for now). I really like the look and feel of this leather cord for the time being. I do have a skinny neck and normally wear my necklaces high, so this works well. Be sure to know how 16"" will fit you."
3,Does what it says... but caution,"You need to understand lots of things beyond the advertisement here or notes that come with this product before you put it on and you go about your business.Be aware that your patella is connected to your patellar tendon and that tendon connects to your quadriceps muscle. If you tack down your patella (which this brace will most certainly do), you will influence things all the way up into your hip & groin.Caveat emptor - do your research. This is a short term fix for most people that it might benefit."
4,cho-pat patellar stablizer,"Works great but on me the top strap doesn't line up correctly so that part of my leg gets sore, but I was between small and medium and should have gone with the large. Only complaint is it doesn't work with hospital slippers and the tile floors."
2,Unreliable,"Mine's just stopped working, after 13 months of fairly light usage. It seems mechanically unreliable. I've had problems with it for some time - after I replaced the first printer cartridges, it began occasionally leaving lines with too little ink across the paper, requiring me to re-print documents. Now, after I just replaced another cartridge, the cartridge carrier is jammed, and the printer is completely unable to function. I didn't expect much out of this device, but I was hoping for something that would remain minimally usable for more than a month after the warranty ran out. Doesn't seem too much to ask.A lesser problem I've had for a longer time is with the scan software. It's slow, and doesn't have a particularly intuitive user interface. It's automatic selection of a page area to scan is pretty terrible, it's difficult to save scan preferences, and there's no way to scan a multipage document as one file."
3,Falls short,"I bought this all-in-one PSC years ago, knowing full well that while it wasn't the best thing on the market, it was an HP printer, and they usually held up well. Several years later, the printer is limping along well enough. The scanner failed, not necessarily because it doesn't work, but because of driver issues. This printer does not play nice with Windows 7, and trying to find the right printer driver can be a hassle. The cost of printer cartridges is outrageous, but that is hardly something limited to HP printers, but is normal for printers in general. Anyone considering this because of the lower price would be better off getting a better model, but in one thing, HP does last a long time."
1,"Owned for 3 years, big mistake since day 1","I debated whether or not to even write this review, as printer models change as fast as mobile phone models and nobody would probably even buy this one anymore. However, this printer has clearly made me regret purchasing it. As other reviewers have pointed out, just about every feature is problematic. The software take up an amazing amount of space, the controls are unituitive, it grabs multiple sheets of paper when printing causing jams and even when you remove the jam it still says that it exists; it does not always scan when you hit the scan buttom; and it absolutely loves to regularly print ""test pages."" Definitely suggest avoiding this printer."
1,PRINTER DIDN'T WORK - LACKED APPROPRIATE DRIVERS,"BEWARE - Box stated that printer would work with Windows 98. We have a network system that contains two windows 98 SE computers. The CD-ROMS in the box were only for Vista, 2000 and XP. I called HP and it could not make good on the blurb on its box stating that it would work for Windows 98."
1,Piece of Junk,"I've had the HP Photosmart C3180 for a few years and its a pain to use. I have to keep reinstalling the info to get it to work. The quick scan button on top rarely activates the instant scan feature. Sometimes the PC will install another copy so there may be 3 copies of your printer and you got to pick which one is in the ""ready"" mode.When I go through the Solution Center to try to get it to scan I get a prompt saying to check the connections........which are fine. Have been fighting with it for 80 minutes trying to get it to scan. I think its time to bring it in the alley for a little game comedian Gallahgher called SLEDGE-A-MATIC.Time to junk it and buy something that will actually work.Have had no compliants for printing out documents or address labels, nor has it used ink like others have posted. I did recently buy a # 99 color ink cartridge last month that had to be returned as it didn't fit in the unit due to the holes not being in the back part of the cartridge."
4,a good purchase,"A great printer for a good price. I've have it for about a year or so and it has been working just fine. If you are doing a lot of printer, ink durability may be a minor concern."
1,Horrible Value,"This is easily the worst printer I've ever owned. I tried to use it on my Macintosh network through the Airport connected by USB. I tried to connect it directly to one of my computers through USB. It didn't make a difference on the setup, which basically only does about half of what's advertised. Even after downloading the latest drivers, the scanner was nearly useless. My 5-year-old $100 flatbed did a better job and had more features. The ink cartridges last for 70-90 pages. I'm on my 6th or 7th one in 3 months, and tired of the Office Max people knowing me by name. I got this for free as part of an Apple promotion, and still feel like I got ripped off."
4,Good but loud,"The printer is good for the price I paid. I had a simpler version of HP but I really needed the scanner so I upgraded. My origonal printer was really quiet which I really like. I live in a dorm so quiet is good. This modle is cheaper but has more features and its parts are therefore louder when the move. For a college student, it serves its perpose. I am satisfied"
2,Out of paper! Out of paper! Out of paper!,Get used to it. You're going to get that message a lot. Even though the paper tray is stacked with fresh paper just waiting for your print job. And the company's troubleshooting won't help. I now keep a legal pad beneath the paper so the stack is high enough to register on the printer's sensor.What do you expect for $100?
1,The paper feeder sucks,"The paper feed on this device is awful. You can have a stack of paper in the tray and you get frequent ""out of paper"" errors. I finally wedged a piece of cardboard beneath the stack so the paper would trigger whatever sensor exists inside the tray.If you visit the HP website about this problem, you will get no help.That's what I get, though, for buying the cheapest printer I could find. The next time, I will spend more money."
1,A waste of time,"Problems with the color cartridge. I contacted HP, after an hour on the phone trouble shooting with no results they sent me a new printer with no new cartridges-same problem!!. I called them and they wanted to go through the same process again. I don't have time for this, all I needed was a new cartridge. I don't want to deal with HP or there customer support anymore. I'll buy from a different company."
1,bad printer,"Got this a few months ago after yet another Epson disaster. This one is okay for the money. What I don't like is the front paper loading. And when I scan photos, blacks seem streaky. Other scanners never did this. And no USB cable included? Lucky I just used my old Epson cable.edit: This printer actually drinks ink, ink leaks and now the print head doesn't work and I need a new printer."
1,I'll be replacing it soon,"The price is low, but the ink cartridges are TINY, and not cheap- I've spent more on ink in 6 months than the printer costs, and I don't use it THAT much. Sometimes it starts sucking up a 2nd sheet of paper halfway through a sheet of photos; so you've wasted 2 sheets, and about 10% of an ink cartridge. I'll be cutting my losses as soon as the next cartridge is gone (next week, probably...)"
4,"Works great, but....","Great as far as doing the job well, but its an ink hog. If you have to print or copy a lot, look for something else. {Unless you don't mind buying ink}"
1,HP Photosmart C3180 Printer,I was disappointed totally with the printer...I sent it back which cost me $18+ to the address it came from in FL. I am waiting for my refund so I can purchase another printer. How long do I have to wait for my refund?Sally Larson
1,It cost more than a buck a minute,"I'm not sure what I expected, but this album is 11 minutes of the same power cord over and over and over....ect. at least the live show last longer, and is slightly more entertaining"
2,Fake,"Smells good, but is obviously a knock off.""Made in Franoe""No worth the money, but still smells okay. Spend the extra money and get a real product. Trust me"
1,Not reliable.,"This company is not reliable. I still haven't received the book, and now I have to wait 7 days to get my refund on top of the 16 days I had to wait to make the complain."
2,Not for beginners.,"This book is mostly page after page of chords and chord progression. If you've never played before, all it will teach you is finger positions for different chords. There are no songs to practice on, and it moves quickly from easy basic chords to complicated explanations and musical techniques that won't help beginners at all. If you're already a pretty good player you may benefit from this book, but if you're beginning from scratch, forget it."
2,My least favorite Pratchett,"I've read six Discworld novels, and this was my least favorite. The book seemed to lose momentum in the middle, and, in my opinion, never recovers. Preferred Men at Arms, Feet of Clay, or Small Gods..."
5,Fantastic!,"I heard about Terry Prachett on a web site and decided to try his books. I'm glad I did! this was the first Discworld book I read and it's not the last. I was hooked on mysteries but not anymore! If you want a good laugh, this is the book to read! Rincewind is the funniest character I've ever read about, (But the Librarian comes in at a close second). All I can say is, Keep up the good work Terry!"
4,No one is safe with Pratchett,"Again, a sacred cow gets skewered in this new installment. Frankly, I do not enjoy the character of Rincewind as much as some of the other characters like Om and Brutha, but Pratchett's new target, the over traditonal societies that remind me heavily of Ancient Europe and China, have been begging to be cut to ribbons. No one is safe again, and where else can you learn about the several different meanings of AAARRRGGGH!!! ?Fun and inventive."
4,Can't go wrong with discworld,This is just the kindle version and a re-read anyway. The story is smack dab in the middle of the pack which means that a lot of other discworld fans hate it while others love it. There is never much consensus on these things. My only quibble was that I bought this and The Fifth Elephant and the footnotes on the Fifth Elephant were much easier to access on the kindle than Interesting times. I don't know why there is a difference but I found that you had to press the down arrow after scrolling over to the asterisk to bring it up. If you're at all familiar with Pratchett you should know that the footnotes are some of the best parts and its distressing to be unable to read them as they come.
5,One of the Best Rincewind books,"I Love Rincewind and Cohen, and Here they are.This one is based on and in Asia.So, Funny!"
4,Magnolia!,"The entire CD is a treat! You can hear the influences of Hendrix, Page and Clapton. Usually I like the faster and heavier songs. HOWEVER-once I heard the version of Magnolia, I knew that this song was going to be a classic! I have made mix cds, and everytime without fail when Magnolia is playing, people wil ask who the artist is. They will ask to hear Magnolia played over again (and again and again!). I gladly play over as many times as I am asked to. I wore out at least a half dozen copies of this album (which was by then out of print in the 1980's) I looked for YEARS to find a replacement copy, and was really glad to find it finally issued on CD. I would have given this CD 5 stars, but it only got 4 because it was a rather short CD. All of the songs are memorable and rock! Magnolia is the standout track on this cd and is well worth the price of admission alone!"
3,A reflection of the past...,"Being an educator of young children living in the heart of Appalachia, I wanted a regional book that would shatter the stereotypes of Appalachia. Instead, this book seemed to embrace them. Yes, many of the things were true, but they do not represent the Appalachia of today. This greatly disappointed me.The ideas represented in this book often reflect the history of Appalachia. I still use the book with my class, but we focus upon the ""Then and Now."" Unfortunately, if you live in another region of the USA, and if you are studying Appalachia, you might not realize that these are reflections from a past, not a true and current view."
4,333 Modern Greek Verbs,"I have found most of my Greek Language Books throw in verb endings which cant always be easily found within their pages. This book gives clear guidance to endings and examples of usage. The jury is out on how well the binding will cope with regular usage , hence 4 stars."
2,Audience?,"If you recognize that the title of this book is taken from Boethius then the book is not for you. I can't remember where I heard about this book (NPR I think). I got on Amazon and ordered it without thinking twice. I was mislead.This is not a book for people with any significant background in philosophy. It is clearly a self help book first and foremost. It belongs next to Chicken Soup for ______, not the original Consolations of Philosophy.If you are looking for self help wrapped in a pop introduction to an interesting group of philosophers this is the book for you. If you are looking for a philosophy book then I've got to agree with the reviewer who commented ""no clothes on this emperor."""
4,Erudite Whimsy & An Insightful Light Read,"Alain de Botton has written another book in his trademark style -- kind of a combination of erudite whimsy, like Woody Allen with a classical education. In this book, he consoles the poor, unpopular, frustrated, inadequate, lovelorn, and those facing difficulties with lessons from Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. This is not a somber, rigorous philosophical text, and it doesn't pretend to be; it lightly touches on the works of some of the heavyweights of philosophy, and it provides some entertaining insights. Overall, I thought it was a light, enjoyable read. If you haven't read any of de Botton's other works, read ""How Proust can change your life"" first (I believe it's slightly better), then if you enjoy that, continue on to this book."
4,Better Living Thought Philosophy,"Better living thought, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Montaigne, Socrates, Epicurus, and Seneca. Alain de Botton accounts of six great philosophers, and what they bring to an individual in modern times. Good read."
4,Completely Cute,"I had purchased How Proust Can Change Your Life some time ago and thought that it was wonderful. I was in the bathroom at Powell's and saw a poster for this book and went and picked up a copy right away. I really like the fact that he doesn't pick typical philsophers (Descartes, Kant, Wittgenstein). This was really my first exposure to Montaigne, Seneca, and Epicurus. His commentary was great as was the style and format of the book. Lots of pictures keep the spirit of it light and airy. This book felt actually helpful with the problems it dealt with, and I'm inspired to check into these philosophers that I didn't know so much about prior to this. I'd suggest this to anyone interested in philosophy, or I think it would make an excellent gift."
1,Difficult,One of the most difficult books I have ever read. Was mandatory for a class. Would only recommend if required reading.
4,Interesting Book,"This was just an enjoyable book. I have read it three times and will read again in the future. It takes place in war torn England and it is beautifully written. It has romance, drama, mystery and all the elements of a good book. There is murder, deception and love. The story is never dull and the characters are likable and believable."
5,Inspiring book!,This book inspired me to have a new attitude toward my home -- and my life! It is written in a mix of prose and lovely poetry -- both of which are full of heart-warming thoughts. I also like the use of word origins to illuminate these thoughts.
4,Favorite Old Testament Bible Stories,"This is another of the Happy Day Bible Story series from Standard Publishers. It is written for the four to eight year old. The narrative includes instructions for interactive involvement within the story line.There are eight favorite Old Testament Bible stories including Noah, David, and Jonah. These stories are arranged sequentially from Genesis chapter one through the book of Jonah.The book is illustrated by Jodi McCallum. The artwork is beautifully done with adorable characters. The backgrounds enhance the story line and stir the child's imagination.The text is written in short easy to understand sentences with words appropriate for the age level.I highly recommend this book for church school resource libraries, for parents, and Christian day schools"
3,"It's good, but.....","I liked the story even though it got a little long-winded. As much as liking the story was reading the descriptions of Berlin and Leipzig, especially the area around the Berlin Wall. Having traveled to both those places in 2005 and had a young tour guide describe the Monday prayer services in St. Thomas Church, made the text seem alive. The seemingly endless droning on about the conditions of the prison did little to enhance the richness of the descriptions of the cities and the events. Read it if you've visited this part of Germany or are looking for something about the final minutes of the reign of terror by the Stasi."
5,Sequel! Sequel!,"I am tired of waiting for the sequel to this book. When is it coming out? I like erotic stories that are not just about the sex, but about the relationships. In this book, I could really see these people together as couples with problems that are resolved through sex; and it came in all spectrums: black with white, black with black, short with tall, caribbean people, sexy albinos, lesbians, French, Africans. I agree with the writer in the spotlight: I too want to see the rest of Nadine's Husband by L. Preston Allen as well as the rest of Deecy and Pheo by Kwame Dawes. What happened to those characters? It can't just end like that. That's one of the problems with short stories, sometimes it leaves you hanging. But I still give the book five stars. Sequel! Sequel!"
2,"""HOW TO MAKE $100,000 A YEAR SELLING THIS BOOK""","There is nothing in this book to help you make that kind of money. The technology that is described in this book is out dated by almost 10 -15 years. in my opinion the only way he is making $100,000 a year is luring people with the appealing title of this book. Save your money and look for other books to suit your needs, or check this book out at your local library if you must read it for yourself."
1,Do NOT Buy this!,I bought this mat and it looks great. The problem is that the top of it is so lightweight that the mat does not adhear to the tub. I took a really bad fall and sprained my wrist and re-injured my shoulder. This mat dangerous. I would hate to think what would happen is someone elderly used this anD slipped in the tub. DO NOT BUY THIS. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED.
2,Penthouse Pet of the Year Playoff 2000,I rated this DVD a 2 stars because the video quality is too bad. The sound quality is not good either. The only good thing about it is Penthouse Pets. They should have done a better job with video and sound quality. Not recommend it
1,A Colossal Disappointment,"I bought this book because I was a big fan of David Wolstencroft's popular television program Spooks/MI5. The story started off very well, and the intricately constructed in the early chapters, only to fall apart completely in the last third of the book. It was as if Wolstencroft decided, ""Ahh, right then, I've grown tired of this one, let's finish it up and then off to the pub."" The story is outlandish, the characters stop being believable, and the ridiculous subplot involving a character who turns out to be mentally unstable just pushes that suspension of disbelief too far. If you're looking for something action-packed, try one of Ian Fleming's excellent James Bond novels (Casino Royale, Moonraker, and Dr. No top my list), and if you want an intricately woven storyline, you can't lose with John le Carre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Don't waste your time on this tripe."
1,Not good,"The good news is, I finished reading this book. The bad news is, I can't believe I paid $8 for it."
1,Word is much better!,"Due to my laptop crashing I had to use a rental computer to finish my novel by the deadline. I've used word to write 3 books, magazine articles and numerous academic papers and I've always found it easy to use and understand. Wordperfect is a complete pain, the help file is useless and the text often overlaps and looks like it is a typo which makes editing on the screen a nightmare. It was impossible to instructions of formatting a document for double spacing in the help menu (it only tells you that book reports should be double spaced, but doesn't tell you how to make it do it). I will be glad to get my laptop back and go back to work in Word."
3,"Smart, wise, yes. A good read, no.","I respect all those who like or love this book.The intellect and wisdom in the author are obvious.Yet for me, it had almost a shorthand style--as if writtenfor the author's own circle of friends who canautomatically decipher her particular meaning in every phraseor reference. It's very rare that I don't finish a book--perhaps 5 times in the last 20 years. But by page 60 or so,I realized I was never going to care much for the characters,and was never going to enjoy the act of reading it. I'm a HUGEIris Murdoch fan, I've read 15 of her books. I had alwaysimagined Byatt and Murdoch as contemporaries--indeed theyendorse each other's books, and Murdoch raved about this one.But for me, Murdoch offers all the human insight and philosophicalgenius and engrosses me in the stories at the same time.This writing is from an impressive mind, but I simply can'tcall it a good read."
2,AN APT TITLE,"There is little movement in this exploration of a mid level suburban English family. Admittedly, there are passages of remarkable insight, but enormous amounts of time are devoted to the author's obsessions with parturition, infant development,pale sexuality, and show-offy displays of her academic credentials in literature. I kept hoping for some original thoughts and theories of human behavior, but was disappointed and bored. Much of this material has been explored before and with greater skill and intelligence.As I moved from page to page it reminded me of slogging through the swamps of Mississippi, on bivouac, back in 1945. It was something that had to be done, but I wondered why."
4,An improvement,"I loved the music and picture features on my chocalate phone but never got very good reception. No one could hear me on that phone. Long story short, the phone I ended up replacing the chocolate phone with is this one. LG VX8600 is an improvement and I've had no more problems with reception or clarity in calls.The large outside display and large inside display are excellent. The inside display is 176 x 220 color display and full 16-bit color. The outside display is fullcolor 160 x 128. With the music playback controls on the front cover, it's easier to play my music and Bluetooth makes it easy for hands-free calling.Built-in USB makes it easy to connect to a computer. I had no problems getting it to work with either, for a pleasant change.The only thing I wish for is a better camera. Cell phones have been stuck with 1.3 Megapixel cameras for what seems like forever. It can't be that much more to include a better camera phone."
4,i keep coming back to this one,"I love all the Poster Kids records, but New World Record is the one I keep coming back to over and over. The album just has the best hooks, and guitar playing."
1,Snuff's enuff,"I endured Saw I-VI, noticing the trend of the series toward less plot and more violence for violence's sake. I got through half an hour of Saw 3d and turned it off. It was a numbing, horrid spectacle to say the least.S3d reminded me of the path Friday the 13th took. After five films, it devolved into gruesome acts of violence without any purpose, only that people wanted to see what interesting ways Jason could eviscerate his victims. You can't watch this stuff without feeling sick and distant, as if humanity had certainly gone downhill.S3d is nothing more than a snuff flick.If you like watching people torn apart and their body parts thrown at you, well by all means, have it at."
1,Very Bad,"So frustrating when the 3D Disc is not functioning well. It get stuck at 0.22second.How can you solve it?If you are talking about a replacement, can you provide me a guarantee that that will work?"
4,Good movie but confusing ending.,"I swear that I'm the only person who was clueless when the last scene was over, and I have been paying close attention to the whole saga. It's a great movie with all the blood and guts anyone could want, but the movie itself was confusing to me."
3,Movie could have been reduced to 30 minutes.,"OK, first off let me say that I own all of the SAW movies, and have seen them in the theaters; needless to say, I'm a big fan.I knew going in to this movie that it was going to be slim on the revelations factor seeing as how this is SAW 7 and we've pretty much figured out absolutely every thing there is to figure out in this saga. Of course, the only thing left was the issue with Dr. Gordon... Did he make it out? Was he alive? etc...In the first 5 minutes of the film, that's answered. Then a ridiculous set of traps begin which really have no purpose in the film except to fill the time. Honestly, the movie could have been trimmed down to about 30 minutes. Really this movie was just milking the franchise for another couple million."
1,Worst Way to Tie up a Series,"Honestly, this had to be the worst movie in the Saw franchise. The ending is predictable, and instead of answering any of our questions gathered throughout the series, they pile up more and refuse to answer any of them. Not only that, but the actors got worse. They added new ones who were completely terrible that I thought I was watching a parody or a sixth grade reenactment. The graphics, ""3D"", and gore was cheesy and boring, and the sold called anticipated ""most horrible trap in the Saw franchise ever"" was a complete joke compared to the rest in the series."
3,the blades never get dawl!!!!!!!!,"i rated thisa bout a 7 out of 10 cause i hoensly hadnt seen the saws ina while i kind of lost, forgotten diffrent charecters i was extremly on the edge of my seats, fast moving someof the affects made me jump i told my self i have to watch the saw series again to re understand the hole story but i liked what i ""saw"" what made me jump a few times i just was kind of on the surpise side seeing all of what happnd to these people i even heard a few people in audiance say ""tell me when this is over (certain scens bugge d them) if you liked th others this was one of the betters one in my book i liked them allbu ti feel part 4 was the dullest, if i was asked to pick oen of but i liked them all in diffrent ways"
3,3-D or not 3-D is to be...,"First off I got all of the Saw movies and I'm happy how all are interconnected tightly all movies pick up after where the last one left off,when I got this movie ""Saw the final chapter"" ( yeah right!!)I purchased the 3-D blu-ray format and I was upset on how this disc won't play in my Samsung BD C5500 player it won't even load up the silver saw going to chrome as the load up icon stops 3/4 of the way (85%)forget the rest..I had to play only the included dvd ( I got 3-D gear coming soon anyway ) I do have to note the pinkish blood and gore was strange,but that was overturned in my opinion as original Saw alumni Cary Elwes and Tobin Bell make their appearance..I don't want to spoil it for anybody buy I liked the movie the only thing that is disappointing was how the 3-D blu-ray was formatted,Lionsgate can do better I don't think you need a 3-D player to play the 2-D version of the film all the Sony 3-D movies play fine this doesn't make sense..It could be a Samsung thing to."
3,SAW -- should have stopped at #6,I thought this final Saw was somewhat of a let down. It just didn't seem to be as graphic as the previous ones were. Would l buy this last Saw again -- I am not sure.
1,3D SAW,"hi, i cannot play this dvd in my play station 3, i would like to have a replacement or instructions on how to make it work, regards."
3,Saw the final chapter,"I love this series but even I have my limit. I noticed that when they attempted to put this movie from its 3D version into the Blue Ray format I thought the red color looked a little odd and tended to bother me. Maybe it was just my copy I am not sure. Like, I said I love this series but I felt this one was just and endless series of ways to torture people with a lame story. Lets end this series."
4,good,"This one finally wraps up the whole series, although I found the whole series too long and in the end VERY predictable."
5,Quilting Improvisation,"This is an awesome book. Viki's ideas are wonderful and easy to follow. I recommend either of her books.However, be aware that the glue on the binding that the publishers put on the copy that received is a problem. My copy fell apart immediately.The info is great, but it is difficult to keep the pages together."
4,Works as stated and good price,The y adpater seems to be working well and have not had any issuse with the 2 that I purchased. Works well to add dual subs to a receiver with only 1 out for a sub. Good price!
4,Statistical Mechanics by McQuarrie,"McQuarrie, is a good resource for statistical mechanics, more so for those with a solid mathematical background so that you can fill in the gaps in the derivations and proofs. It is relativily easy to understand and covers the majority to topics well."
2,Wasn't for me but....,"I was looking for something new in ethnic music, and despite the reviews, for me this absolutely wasn't it. I am sure if I enjoyed dance music more, this would be better, but if you're looking to experiment, I highly recommend listening first before you buy! There are other good examples of ethnic European/Middle Eastern fusion that are simply easier on the ears. That said, I'm sure Balkan Beat Box is great for what it is, if it's your thing."
5,MY FAVORITE,"I HAVE ONE OF THESE CDS IN EVERY CAR ,HOUSE AND SHOP. GOT TO HAVE THIS ONE MY FAVORITE. GREAT VOICE!"
5,Best and Brightest of Newcomers,"The debut album by Andy Griggs will impress any fan of country music. Every song on this album is top-notch, from the mid-tempo songs like ""You Made Me That Way"" to great ballads like his first single and title song, ""You Won't Ever Be Lonely."" His talent is evident, and I am looking forward to listening to his sophomore album that was released last week. If you are looking for one of the next big stars in country music, I really think you have found him in Andy Griggs. (This, btw, coming from a long-time Garth Brooks fan!) Buy this album...you will not be disappointed."
3,Not as good as The Men from the Boys,"This continues after Men from the Boys ended, and continues, and continues....there is a lot of repetition, especially between Jeff and Lloyd who are reconciling and then not, over and over again. The same themes are rehashed several times, especially the ""we are all connected/family"" bit.This kept reminding me of Queer as Folk, and I could easily see it as one of their later seasons (not the groundbreaking first season) which were more soap opera-y.The new character of Eva was fun, her being the freakozoid that she was. The situation of Jeff and Anthony was similar to Jeff and Eduardo. There were some aspects of a mystery to this book--a genre that I never read--and I was surprised that that actually helped keep my interest in the book.A good, easy beach read, or a fun television soap opera."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is funny as hell and if you have a wack sense of comedy you won't stop laughing!, I would recommend this to anyone in need of a laugh."
3,Too soon to tell,"I have just begun to use the RED XL so it is too soon to tell if I will get results. It is an easy use, however, that does not mean I will achieve the results desired."
1,Do not buy,"This is a useless product. I do not exercise much, and I do not even get a burn from this machine. The DVD is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone. It looks like it is low budget!"
3,red exercisor review,"The red exercisor was easy to put together. I was worried it would be complicated but it was not. The exercises are easy to do, maybe a little too easy. I don't find the ""resistence"" button really makes a huge difference. The first video is really basic, but it does give a routine for a good start. This doesn't strike me as the machine to create a big difference in inches, but it seems to be helping with basic toning. I don't feel a real big effort from the exercises, but they do help. The good thing about it, is I can expand on my time on the chair, and that increases the results. The video is pretty cheesy - they could have selected and filmed with a little higher quality, but it gives a good beat to stay motivated."
2,Never used,"I bought this chair for my mom, she wanted it so bad. She used it twice, and maybe she is not as driven as most people to work out but she didnt like it or it didnt work."
3,Didn't seem like a waste at first...,"I really enjoyed using the machine so far. However, it already broke! I haven't even had it a month and it is totally broken. I am looking for a way to get it fixed but it is looking like I'm either going to have to ship it back and wait 6 weeks or buy a new one. What a waste!"
5,Red XL Abdominal Exerciser- Amazom.com,It is fantastic. I try to do it twice a day and I do see some small results in my clothing and how my slacks fitI LOVE IT
3,Mixed bag of early harmonicists,"This CD is a mixed bag of early harmonica work. On one hand, it contains a few forgettable tunes by some ""squawkers"" (my pet phrase for mediocre harmonica players). However, it also contains the work of ""Rhythm Willie"" Hood, a hero among harmonicists and the pioneer of the jazzy harmonica styles of Toots Thielemans, Lee Oskar, and Stevie Wonder. This partially makes it worth the price of admission. Some good old fashioned fun is to be had by the jug bands of Eddie Kelly and Jed Davenport. So if you get this used at a reduced price, it would be worthwhile."
4,Working great,"I bought this a few months ago to tackle issues with my digital cable signal. I was having trouble with pixelation on HD and premium channels.The second I hooked this up, the pixelation has 99.9% disappeared.I placed this at the end of a long run of coaxial cable and it works perfectly. It works with digital cable and does not affect my cable internet. A solid solution for hours of frustration on the phone with the cable company."
3,Don't bother,"The first one was DOA, and it took days to arrange for a replacement. Not worth the hassle."
5,The Best Cookbook I Own,"This is a tremendous cookbook. There's something for everyone, from simple recipes up to some pretty involved and multi-faceted meals. I've been fortunate enough to dine at Blue Ginger on four separate occasions, and it gets better each time. Every time I look through this book, it's an inspiration. Plus, it's great to be able to recreate some of the dishes I've enjoyed at the restaurant. The book's design adds to the experience; although there aren't pictures for each dish, the two color spreads are pretty impressive. Some of the more complicated recipes feature hard-to-find ingredients, but many use ingredients found in any decent grocery store. I've been most successful with the Gingered Sweet Potatoes thus far, followed by the Asian Marinated Pork Loin. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in learning how to prepare familiar (and not-so-familiar) foods in new and interesting ways."
5,"easy to follow, good results","easy to follow recipes, great results. The food is really different; I had a dinner party for a few friends and it was easier than usual and my guests raved about the food."
3,Good game Bad Directions,"This Game was fun. We had burgers,Dressed up,And decorated like the 50's.But When It came time to play the game the ""private dialoge"" Was written in first personand No one figured this out unitel the end of the first round.The overall plot was GREAT though but the answer is Unreal. Overall it was a Ok game."
4,Are ghosts real?,"My only issue with this Magic Treehouse book was that it includes a few scenes with the ghost of a cowboy. My daughter was only 5 when we first read it, so it led to the talk of ""are ghosts real mommy?""However, the book was very entertaining, and my kids still love it! We love all of the Magic Treehouse series and would recommend them as long as your children are old enough to know the differece between real and imaginary."
3,Have used for over a year.,"It's a nice moisturizer..a quality one in fact as it doesn't irritate my eyes at all like cheaper ones and does keep them feeling soft. But I don't find it doing anything else with lines, puffiness... anything. A tad expensive for a moisturizer I'm afraid."
4,Good under desk exerciser,"I was looking for something to put under my desk at work to do some slow peddling to burn a few calories during the day and to compensate for staring at a computer screen all day. This seems to be the ticket. Price wasn't too high. Collapses for moving. The only thing is that it started squeeking soon after using it, but I brought in some powdered graphite and lubricated everything. Now it's working silently away."
1,dont like it,"i really didnt like this book, and thought that it would be better than what it would have been."
2,Nothing special.,"This album is nothing special. Giro was just another Salsa Romantica singer trying to compete and make a name for himself in an already overcrowded field by the time this CD was issued in 1994. Frankie Ruiz, Paquito Guzman, Cheo Feliciano, Rey Ruiz and Gilberto Santa Rosa all made far better and more enjoyable Salsa Romantica albums."
5,GREAT,"Product arrived early, and was in brand new condition. Looked exactly as the picture depicted. Combined with the steering wheel cover i also purchased, this item gives my car a great look, and has fueled my need for speed! Signed: Satisfied Customer."
5,Date pieces,I love these - they are so easy to eat and not sticky like the whole dates. I love to mix them with raisins and I eat them daily.
5,If I were stranded on a deserted island with one CD...,"I never get tired of Second Coming. I never find myself in the mood to NOT listen to it. For three years now, this has been a favorite of mine. I think the tracks weave an interesting concept of the Second Coming, and tracks like Breaking Into Heaven and Driving South are hypnotic. The riffs on Daybreak are fantastic. In my opinion, this is the best concept album since The Wall, and I would even say it's better. I don't get all the comparisons to Led Zep. The Roses are so much better than that tired high school sound of 70s dinasaurs. Zep has their place in history, and a sound that fits fine for retro radio, but Second Coming isn't so dated. One more thing...if you ever have to go on a long drive at night, put this album in, crank it up, and cruise. It's great driving music, like Golden Earring and Pink Floyd. Actually, ""trippy"" might be a fitting description! Buy this and enjoy it."
2,Over-reaction then and now,"this isn't a 5 star or a 1 star album.their first album was a 5 star album.if second coming had been their debut, they never would have been allowed to make a second.it is just marginal classic-rock homage. yawn."
4,Five years on,"Yes, it took 5 years before this album was released, and, well, it wasn't quite like the first album, in fact you couldn't get anymore different.You got the birds, the bealtes, the beach boys & hendrix in the first album; in the second album you got led zeppelin x10.When this album was released it was panned by the criticts, but in retrospect, this must be regarded as one one the best rock albums of the 90s. You've got Lez Zeppelin licks mixed with typical laid back 90's british grooves and you've got a winner. In 1994 I admit I would have given it maybe 3 out of five, but now, 4 and a half out of 5."
3,Man...,"I can't believe all the five-star ratings here. This album is not to be condemned outright, but it's just sooooo inferior to the band's debut that it's hard not to be very disappointed. Compared to The Stone Roses, Second Coming would barely register, making one star too high, but on its own it's not that bad. It's one of those albums that for the most part sounds pretty good while it's playing, but doesn't leave much of an impression when it's over. Breaking Into Heaven and Love Spreads sort of come close to capturing the sizzling power of the Stone Roses of yore, and I wouldn't say any of the songs (with the obvious exception of the scarily bad hidden ""bonus"" track) are unendurable, but really--it's just ludicrous to compare anything here to Fools Gold and I am the Resurrection. Oh well. Worth owning for the price."
5,Only for the hardcore box maker,I'd love to review this book but I'm afraid I died of boredom trying to read it.
3,Confessions is not on par with Gage's typical literary works,"As an avid fan of Elizabeth Gage, I check with various book stores frequently on when her next novel is coming out. I happened to stumble across ""Confession"" and was thrilled to see that Ms. Gage was still writing, although I was disappointed that there was little publicity about the book. I must say that ""Confession"" does not depict the quality of Ms. Gage's other novels, e.g., Glimpse of Stocking, Taboo, Master Stroke. I can only hope that her next book, ""Hourglass"", gives us back the old style of literary works!"
4,Great lively music!,This music has terrific rhythm. Good for dancing or even exercising. CD arrived in perfect condition.
2,Update--Compatability with Panasonic DMR-E80H,"As a follow up to my post earlier this month---After having success with the first spindle of these disks I bought a second spindle and out of the first 8 disks, 3 would not record. I suppose one could get lucky with one batch and unlucky with another (when it comes to this Panasonic unit anyway). I won't be using the remainder of the 2nd batch nor will I be ordering more."
1,Lite-On LDW-400D hates these discs,"My drive has burned 9 coasters out of 10 from these. I've tried at 4X, 2X, and even 1X using multiple burning software packages. It simply won't burn.I also read on USENET a bunch of posts about the SONY version of my drive (different name) having the exact same problem.BUYER BEWARE!!! Mine are going back!"
4,None too shabby.,"I'd certainly say this book was worth the while. While much of what it teaches you may have already learned from another source (he does borrow from better well known teachers he has worked with, such as Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner,) there are a few unique lessons and exercises Moss offers. But what really drives this book home is the amount of attention he places on an actors work ethic. This book can be a huge wake up call to get actors to realize how much effort they must put into their craft. I will say though, I felt he did share a few personal experiences, intended to offer examples of what was being taught, that I don't think your average actor is likely to encounter and were therefore hard to relate with. I wouldn't recommend it as to be your primary book for acting info, but all the same, this book has much to offer for both new and experienced actors."
1,"Not Trek, that's for sure","I'm not a Trekkie, Trekker, or whatever. I have not seen every episode of all the various series. That said I have enjoyed some of the books written about the Star Trek Universe. The trouble with a multi-authored series though is the uneveness one finds in the mix. From what I remember of the original series, (and Next Generation and the new series) is the sense of wonder, a feeling of joy and camaraderie between the main characters. The authors of this book suck that joy and wonder out of everything and write a soulless gloomy novel that bears no resemblance to the Star Trek phenomenon. It is a novel of despair with not one refreshing moment. To me, the novels should reflect the spirit of the series or it's just a bad science fiction novel with characters named after the members of the Trek universe."
3,"Okay, but not great.","This book I thought was acceptable. At times, it was interesting, but overall it was just average.The story basically revolves around the Krik losing his command to Spock (temporarily) on the order of a well-respected Vulcan, who happens to believe that humans contaminate Vulcans. While in command, Spock is pretty emotional and seems to delight in knocking Kirk down a few pegs. Finally, the story reaches its climax when Spock, Kirk, McCoy and the other Vulcan are taken captive by very-powerful aliens who are basically using them as science experiments, much as animals are sometimes used for testing. In the end, they escape the aliens because Kirk is able to accept Spock as captain, then when they get back on the Enterprise, Kirk is given command again.I think that this story could have been told better, with less emphasis on Vulcan command procedures and Vulcan superiority. It was not very fast-paced or exciting, just a good way to spend a few hours in mindless entertainment."
4,Not bad at all.,"If you want a fast pacing action story, this book is not for you. But if you like a psychological thriller that you are thrown head first into, this book is well worth a read. You move alongside Kirk and company when they are trying to cope with alien scientists using them as rats in a maze. Nothing is what it seems to be and no one knows where to go for answers."
3,Still trying to find my niche,Had hoped this would help me decide upon a business to start. The video is good .
5,"I'ts official ,I like this series.","This is the second Harry Dresden book in the series of a wizard. I really like Harry he can really be tough when he has to be, but really caring and protective when his close friends and associates need his help. Karin Murphy of the police dept. has asked for his help in solving some very vicious and grusome crimes, which lead to the association of Tera and few locals of the werewolves of a couple of tribes. This book is a little harder to follow to keep all the people straight,but if you keep on reading and following the story he nicely bring everything to a nice closing. He can still show a lady a very exciting evening. I really want him to get together with Susan the local reporter they really make a nice couple, and I like Karin to, and I would like to see more of of Tera and the local werewolves. Now I have to read the next book in my collection of Harry Dresden."
3,Maybe There's Hope,"I am starting to like Harry Dresden. I wasn't sure in the first one but I believe there's hope. I like that he's a little bit of a mess. A wizard who can't keep his love life moving in the right direction, he's a little bit clumsy, a little bit of a liability, and a little bit of a screw-up but with huge hero-potential. I'm going to try out the next one. I have heard that #3 is when the series really starts. I'll keep you posted!"
5,Great story,I really enjoyed this book. It doesnt disappoint and is full of action. I'd recommend anyone to listen to this book.
5,Leader of the Pack...,"Jim Butcher does it again with another fun Harry Dresden book. This book picks up a few months after ""Storm Front."" The main meat of the story deals with a werewolf killer on the loose. But there are many kinds of wolves and many kinds of killers.Harry's police friend Murphy know that something is up and want Harry's help. But the friendship they had at the beginning of Storm Front hasn't weathered well... Murphy no longer has the same trust of Harry she once had. And that's what makes this book such a great read. The interplay of Harry and Murphy, and the steps they take to protect each other, and the consequences that result, make for a very worthwhile read.The mystery is well played and the action and adventure are well paced but the real magic of this comes from the great characters and their interactions. Harry's struggles both internal and external keep the reader interested and coming back for more."
4,3.5 round up to 4 for entertainment value,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because I was really entertained.It would be a 4 because it made me turn page after page and I didn't want to put it down. It would be a 3 because I saw no clear character development if compared with the previous book and I didn't have the impression my vision of Harry's world expanded. I expect some sort of progression in a series, things getting more complicated, getting to know more about the characters and their world, but I didn't get it in this book. I had the impression characters were keeping their cards too close to their chests, it was difficult to find my way in. As in the previous book, I like Harry more when he's talking about his lost family. There's something dark in Harry, let's find it out."
4,"Fun read - nothing more, nothing less","Light and fun reading. Good for relaxing without having to analyze or think too much when the mind is already tired from a long day of work.Butcher elicits the occasional chuckle as Harry tries to save the day, utterly failing in so many ways, one wonders how he ever made it past the first few chapters without killing himself.As another review mentioned, it's a bit annoying that for the sake of new readers, the source of magic, each character and such has to be explained again and again; not a big deal though.I wish they did better proofreading on this (and vol 1) though. Often there are it's/its mistakes or other grammatically incorrect sentences. This distracts from the reading flow as one's mental image of the current scene collapses under an angry ""Who proofread this!?"""
1,"Great ideas, terrible execution","A friend recommended this series to me, and the way she described it sounded amazing. When she tells me about the things that happen over the course of the series I'm fascinated, but the writing is really terrible and remarkably boring. I found I couldn't connect with any of the characters and had to give up on the book entirely."
5,Sequel Exceeds Expectations,"I recently read Jim Butcher's first Dresden novel, ""Storm Front"", and enjoyed it, but was not overwhelmed by any means. However, the promise was there. I loved the combination of hardboiled, well maybe medium boiled, private eye, the adventure, and more than a strong touch of the occult and supernatural thrown into the mix. With his newest Dresden sequel ""Fool Moon"", Mr Butcher has taken off the rough edges, delineated his characters and sped up the action to make this a really fun and exciting read. I can hardly wait for more Dresden adventures and look forward to seeing future character developments."
2,"Good to read, bad to listen to.","I thought it would be impossible to get bored with a book in which there are wizards, werewolves, magic, demons and all other kinds of creatures that I normally get excited about. And it may be very entertaining when read in an actual book, but as an audio book, this one is a killer. The narrator is Harry Dresden, Chicago's only wizard for hire, as he likes to remind us, and throughout the whole narrative, his voice does not change much. The plot revolves around a series of crimes committed by a werewolf, and the local police, helped my Dresden, is trying to solve the mystery of the killer, but not believing in werewolves is a major barrier in this process. The book is read by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Angel) who, I have to say, should have kept his delightful British accent. He kept putting me to sleep with his melodic but somewhat monotonous voice. So the bottom line is - buy the book, not the audio book. Or else beware.[...]"
4,Book review,"My daughter loved the book. She read all four of the series. These books are about supernatural forces, creatures, and events. I suppose any teenager would like them."
4,An enjoyable book,I am a fan of the TV series and I was worried that having seen all those episodes would spoil the books for me. This book removed those concerns. I enjoyed the book and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
3,Not Bad,I was a big fan of the Dresden Files tv series which ran on SciFi about a year ago. Ever since then I wanted to read some of the books to see how they were. I read the first two books in the series. They were okay but nothing great. IN my opinion the second book (Fool Moon) is a little better than the first (Storm Front). I don't think I am going to go any further. I did like the tv show and wish they would bring it back. Maybe that would give me the incentive to continue reading the series. If anyone can convince me that the other books get better I might consider going forward.
5,"O.K., Now This is a Movie!","If this movie were shown in a sports facility by the end people would be shouting ""Olivia, Olivia, Olivia!"" Brilliant performances by Olivia De Havilland, Montgomery Clift and the entire cast. I LOVE this movie! Get the popcorn and/or a drink, get comfy on the sofa and enjoy!"
2,Too Big,"I didn't realize the size of this stuffed animal when I got if for my 7 month old. I guess if it was a little bit smaller and not the size of him, we may be a little more fond of it. Guess we will hold on to it until he is a little older."
2,Fun to watch but.....,"this is definitely NOT a DVD that I would recommend for beginners. If you don't have any hip-hop dance experience and hope to learn to freestyle from this, GOOD LUCK. I couldn't keep up. If you are a quick choreography learner, you'll love this DVD....as a beginner I was lost and feeling like I was out of my element after 5 minutes. But as I mentioned before, it was fun to watch! He's an incredible dancer and watching the audition process was very cool."
5,Duffel bag second time around,This is the second year my son in law has asked for this Armor Gear Duffel for Christmas. He really loves it. It is his carry on luggage when he flies and his gym bag the rest of the time. He has worn out the first one. The manufacturer shipped in a timely fashion and I received it promtly and in good condition.
1,Phased Array Antennas (Wiley Series in Microwave and Optical Engineering) by R. C. Hansen (Purchased on 03/16/2010),"This book has numerous technical errors and inadequate references. The deficiencies apparently stemed from the author's attempt from the role of editor in his previous book on this subject published in the 1960s, which is comprehensive and of high quality, to a single-authored book without adequate research on each subject covered. However, this book does have the merit of bringing up new issues and progresses in phased arrays over the past decade, even though some controversies and inaccuracies were created in the process by the author."
3,Finally something nice from Pakistan,The Kukri or Kukuri knife has a long history in Nepal and India. This particular copy made in Pakistan should be advertised as a Kukuri and not Nepalese if made somewhere other than Nepal. The knife itself is very well finished and seems to have a good quality stainless steel blade. It is NOT razor sharp as advertised but is sharp enough for most uses. The nice wood handle and rivets are finished well and has a nice tight butt cap. It is a sturdy knife. My biggest complaint is that the sheath doesn't fit the knife. The sheath is too short for the blade which means I will have to either repair the sheath later or find a blade tip cover to insert into the sheath. The leather quality is above average for Pakistani items though. One of the nicer knives I've seened coming from Pakistan and I would rate it higher if it had a better sheath. A good collectors item or for general camping use. A very nice knife for the price. A Kukuri fancier will like this one.
2,Overpriced,"I was disappointed with this lantern. It is very expensive, the lightbulb is difficult to replace, and the long light stand is easily bent by pets or landscapers brushing aside it."
1,Broken,"I have quite a few of these along my two outdoor paths. They are on the inside edge of concrete walkways, so there's no mowing around them or other rough treatment, but most of them are broken where the lamp attaches to the post. I spent a lot of money getting them wired in, and I'm really disappointed that I'll have to pay to have something else put in if I want to replace them. Not recommended."
3,Spock Was a Hippie. Who knew?,"I had heard about this book for years before actually being able to read it, and I must admit I was a bit disappointed.I've always appreciated Mr. Nimoy's work in show business, but this book revealed a personality farther toward the ""other"" end of the spectrum in terms of logic v. emotion.I didn't expect him to be Spock (duh)... I just also didn't expect him to be such an unregenerate, almost-cliche 60's hippie. Sigh."
2,Not the best,The scenery was very nice but the choice of music and narration did not live up to expectations (the series Visions of Greece and Italy set the standard in this type of fly over travel experience). Thought the best part was at the end when they show the women performing a traditonal dance and that was cut short.
5,perfect,"Received my item ahead of schedule! I'm happy with my new hard hat! I been on a search for a black hard hat due to the work I do( shag driver,) and keeping a white hard hat clean is one hard job"
2,Disappointing,"I love all the Tinderstick albums and have all of them, however this one is very disappointing. They are beginning to sound like a regular top 40 R&B band. I hope the next one will be back at their old style."
2,No beginning or end,"I understand the negative reviews on this movie now that I have watched it. This movie felt like it was pieced together to capitalize off of the successful Bourne franchise. The story felt rushed and the ending was terrible. Right in the middle of an action sequence that seemed to be leading somewhere, it cuts to the star and the girl on a boat out in the middle of the ocean. And then rolls to the credits.Sadly that is a metaphor for the movie. It is like a boat floating out in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight."
2,"Slow, plodding, boring","While the Bourne Legacy has all of the elements of a good movie, it lacks much of the charm of the earlier Bourne movies. The actors do a good job, but the movie moves along unevenly, with meager action scenes interspersed among people telling us that stuff is happening. Many scenes contribute little to the overall movie to the point that once the protagonists board the airplane, some unnecessary 'tension building' scenes just pissed me off -- oh no! He couldn't find her on the airplane! He looks there! And there! Oh, wait, there she is. WHY IS THAT SCENE THERE. The climactic fight scene ends with a whimper and an unrealistic burst of CGI, as does the movie itself, which left the both of us wondering, ""That's it?""Basically the movie watches like the director/writer couldn't let go of any of the scenes he wrote. This film could have been much improved."
3,Not as good as it look!,Movie its bit confusing.Different actor subject almost the samethere's no real subject inside its justaction.looks like its all about what afterjason borne.
3,It's okay,Kind of predictable plot. Ending was pretty weak as well. Action scenes were good but the motorcycle chase scene was pure Hollywood.
5,"Excellent, entertaining",Perfect action movie - kept moving the whole way through. Aaron Cross was more fun than Jason Bourne (though I loved the first three). Highly recommend.
2,Bourne to lose,The previous Bourne movies ranged from good to very good. This one was not very good. I give it 2 stars.
2,A disappointment,"I had high hopes when I rented this movie and was really looking forward to it. But alas, my hopes were quashed...The movie starts slow and doesn't give you a story to allow you to relate to the characters or even care about them.Unfortunately, the movie not only starts slow it stays slow for almost its entirety. It only gets interesting near the end during the chase where you suddenly remember that this is supposed to be an action movie!As for the movie's conclusion, only 5 minutes after the one and only chase... it's a complete let down. You don't get any closure nor do you feel that you can't wait for the sequel like other movies have done.This is just a blah movie and in retrospect, I should've just waited for it to come out on cable. Don't waste your money"
4,fast paced genre,"of course i chose because it's a ludlum book. gritty, good, fast paced, typical ludlum fare so I consider it a good watch. actually this character is probably closer to 'real' than pretty boy matt damon who did a good job as bourne. if there is a sequel? I'm there."
3,Wish Matt Damon was in it.,It left me hanging at the end of the movie. Maybe there will be another one?? The action was still pretty good compare to the 3 before it.
2,Fails at trying to cash in on first Bourne movies,"This movie was clearly an effort to cash in on the original, successful Bourne movies, but fails miserably due to its lack of a developed plot. There are many things they could have done with this movie that they simply did not... trying to setup a new trilogy? Well, the first one should hook you on something interesting. I like Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz, but they were wasted on this film."
3,The Bourne Legacy,Where is Matt Damon? What a difference. I kept looking for him. Even when he gets old enough to need a cane he would bring more excitement.
3,the legacy is it's over for the Bourne series,"Well, the legacy is without Matt Damon this series dies. The action scenes work well here but the plot is even more convoluted with what looks like flashback clips from the other three movies. Sorry, Jeremy Renner, but I'm out. Just did not surprise and enthrall me like the very first Bourne movie did out of the blue or the third one did for all-out action."
3,Wind down to Bourne trilogy with weak intro to future Bourne movies...,Too much time spent setting up next movie and looking at logistics of how Aaron Cross comes to be and functions rather than seeing him at work. Should have started with him on a mission and ended with him firing a warning shot at those coming after him. Weak transition from Bourne trilogy but still worth watching.
3,Entertaining,"This movie is the sequel to all the other Bourne movies; however, it takes us to a far reaching journey that involves the creation of Super Humans. Not your regular Bourne movie.I had hopped that it was a true sequel to the originals, but was deseponted. The ending is anti climatic.If you are bored, this is fine."
5,Cool Movie,"All of the Bourne Movies are exciting, including this one. I liked the story line and the actors. I would tell people to rent it."
3,"Started out great, then got stupid","I'm a fan of the Bourne series and this one just doesn't measure up. The first half is exciting and fun and interesting, especially while in Alaska--the wolf thing was pretty creative. I was just about buying this guy as a 'Bourne' type and then they hop a plane and end up in Manila, and then it just gets stupid. Lots of holes in the plot. Chasing pills/drugs and 'virusing out' is just hard for me to believe the way it was presented. The villian in Manilla with his sunglasses and white pants was just ridiculous and i didn't buy it. And it didn't all come together at the end, the ending was weak. Didn't leave a cliffhanger for another one like past movies in this series. Not that I would see a follow up to this one."
2,"Good, but not as good","Good action, but did not live up to the previous Bourne movies, maybe it was tough getting used to a new lead actor."
3,"lots of action, no story","Bourn LegacyLots of action, very little plot/story line, predictable. Good photography. Movie much better without Matt Damon. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Not really Bourne,"While it has Bourne in the title and throws numerous references to Jason Bourne and has many of the same cast it falls far short of the Bourne Trilogy. The movie starts out exciting and fast paced, but eventually somewhere along the way it just falls flat. it has a horrible ending and the plot of the movie made little to no sense at all. If you're familiar with Anime just imagine Dragonball Z with villains that just keep getting more ridiculously powerful it is absurd what they come up with at times. That is how I felt about this movie as halfway through they basically release a Wolverine type clone from the X-men movies to chase down Jeremy Renner's character."
2,Sucks,"Compare to the original Bourne movies, it's definitely lack of thrill, not enough action, and the story doesn't make sense at all."
4,Action Out the Proverbial Wazoo!!!,"Enjoyed this flick with grandma, grandpa, wifey and my boys. Total Action Out the Proverbial Wazoo!!! Needed a single malt to take off the movie induced tension - good stuff!"
2,Good potential but weak ending,"The ending is weak. It had a lot of potential and lots of good action, but it seems like they just ran out of story-line and ended the movie. Definitely a setup film for the next release."
3,Don't expect much!,"Not as good as the other Bourne movies. Worn out plot. Not much of a story, just a real long chase."
4,Bourne Legacy,"Reaally enjoy the action, great stories. Completes my series. So I can enjoy it over and over. Like the actors and have other movies so follow them."
3,Did not like it,"This felt like is not at all going with all the rest of Bourne movies and with ending be so open , we all agree this was just very poorly made"
5,Excellent,Just enough of action with a good plot. Did not over burden the movie. Jeremy Renner is hunk. Good job.
2,"Despite the name and the effects, not engaging","It had lots of the ingredients of the first Bourne movies save Matt Damon but it just wasn't as good. The story was also not written by Robert Ludlum. They slapped the Bourne name on it and did seem to put quite a bit of money into chase scenes and effects but the story was disjoint and I found it hard to get too invested in any of the characters. I kind of followed the story but at times, it just wasn't well glued together. I watched it at home and found my attention straying. My wife left mid-movie."
3,"not bad, but not as good as the original Bourne movies.","I love a good action flick. This one had some good action but the story line looks like a rewrite of the Bourne films and to a Bourne fan, this did not say to me...WOW on the story line. The acting was good. Renner and Weiss work together well but like I said, they failed in my eye to get me to accept the story line as a Bourne movie."
3,Not Bourne....,Should have just stopped. Why did they have to make this one? Should have at least had a Matt Damon cameo in there somewhere. I'm a bourne fan and this just wasn't it!!
3,It was ok,"Not as much kicking butt as the previous, slow starting. I feel asleep twice about 2/3rds in. Pretty violent in the beginning."
4,Wow,"Wow wow wow lots of action, good story Can not wait for the next Sequel .If you like spy thrillers you will love this movie"
3,ACTION PACKED,"Great photographic panoramas....super chase scenes. Missed that there were No kissing scenes. Film was a good ride, enjoyed it alot."
2,I is nothing like the original Bourne series.,"I bought the movie for my husband and I did not watch it myself. He said that if he hadn't previously read the book, he would not have understood the movie at all."
2,No substance,Entire movie is about Jeremy Renner trying to get pills. Little to no plot or substance. Chase scene at the end of the movie seems to last for about 40 minutes. One of the worst big budget movies that I have ever seen. Save your $5 and rent something else.
4,Excellent,We own the Bourne trilogy and this one didn't disappoint. Our entire family enjoyed it and will watch over and over again.
4,Interestingly edited,"The move is filled with back and forths, laying the foundation for another government conspiracy while the hero assassin is suffering while the government program is being shut down to prevent disclosure. Enter the innocent scientist who did what she was told and neglects responsibility for the effects on the humans being tested. Jeremy Renner kidnaps here to ""save"" her and to get the formula needed to save his own life.......The themes seem old, though the acting was good. Rachael Weiz was excellent."
3,could have been so much better,"I am a huge fan of the previous Bourne movies and was somewhat skeptical about this ""legacy"" movie. Jeremy Renner does a great job, he is an actor that keeps improving and is very credible as a ""Bourne"" lead. The storyline was pretty good, Ed Norton well cast as the bad guy from the Federal Government. Rachel Weisz was a real disappointment however, she is usually a great actress but in this was totally unconvincing not helped by some pretty slack writing for her character. The worst part of the movie was the endless formulaic chase at the end. It just dragged on and on with none of the tension or believability of other Bourne movies. And then... the movie ended, very strange. Maybe it was a setup for a sequel but it left me feeling like I had seen half of a movie. Much better to restart the franchise with a good solid movie and build on that rather than the weak ending which is offered here."
2,Review,Not worth the money. Simply not as good as the previous episodes. Truly a waste of money. Needs to be reevaluated.
2,This movie put all three of us to sleep,Too much talking and not enough action. This movie just seemed to drag on and on.. Not as good as the previous movies. I am disappointed
2,Alot of Running no fighting,"Worst ever I totally regret I bought it, He actually comes in contact with three people that's it. The whole movie is about him running that's it. 3 I repeat 3 people he physically touched and got into a fight with. Shame !!!! boo"
4,Not the same w/o Matt Damon,It's not the same without Matt Damon but still just as good of quality and suspense. I'd watch it again.
3,Not conclusive,This movie was not nearly as good as the original three in the series as it did not come to a proper conclusion.
3,Honestly not worth buying,No where close to the original series. The plot was a feeble attempt to play off the original series. Failed miserably.
4,The Bourne Legacy,Loved the movie was unsure but was very surprised in the direction the movie took not at all what i expected
3,"Characters were ""meh"", action was entertaining","The ending was slightly disappointing, but not too bad. A lot of shooting, running/chasing and not as much ""thinking"" material, but I suppose that should be expected in a Bourne movie. =)All in all, I enjoyed it, but would prefer to watch something like Inception, Looper, or Skyfall, for a little more character depth without losing the action/adventure."
3,It's OK,"I loved all the Bourne movies, but this one was just ok. Something was missing in the story line, or it was just too long of a story for me."
1,forgettable,Quoted in a review as the movie you will be sorry you watched in the morning. They weren't kidding. Very boring and forgettable.
2,Definitely Not the Same Quality As Matt Damon's Films,"Being an outrageously huge fan of the Jason Bourne series, and having seen the first three, I gave this a look just compare with the trilogy Matt Damon, Paul Greengrass and Doug Liman did; WOW......what a difference!! Even giving Jeremy Renner credit for trying to follow up such a incredible series of films, this film was weak. The story line was a little confusing and the performers all seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. All-in-all, leave this one for when it comes on TV for free, or as part of an existing streaming subscription you may have (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc), where you won't have to pay anything for it......like I did."
2,A Bourne wanna be,"Not what I expected. This movie tries to give viewers a feel of Bourne movies but the only things it does is show movie clips from previous ones. The beginning of the movie is slow and predictable and once the whole plot comes ""into"" light you are left hanging. This was like watching an episode of your favorite TV show and told to tune in next week to see what other crazy things may come up. Renner and Weisz were good but not real chemistry between them. It was funny to watch them at the end of the movie get all ""naughty"" with their cheesy lines!"
3,Average movie,"The Bourne Legacy starts and ends with a lot of action scenes, but there is a huge lull in the middle. For about 45 minutes to an hour the movie generates little action. During this lull the science of how Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz)is able to solve Aaron Cross's (Jeremy Renner)problems with his ""super soldier"" medication is flimsy at best. Also you need to see all three of the previous Bourne movies to have any idea what is going on. The Bourne Legacy cannot stand on it's own.The Bourne Trilogy set the bar very high for any Bourne related movie. The Bourne Legacy lacks substance for a little less than half the movie. Unless you are a die hard spy movie fan I would avoid this one."
4,"I was skeptical at first, but I rented it and liked it","Spoiler alert!The ending left you wondering if there will be a sequel to the 4th sequel. Worth watching, but don't expect a whole lot of action and intensity until a ways into the movie"
4,Entertaining,"This movie is entertaining and worth watching, just not as amazing as the other Bourne movies. Still recommend watching if you like action."
3,reaching,"This movie was entertaining, but I felt as if the producers tried to hard to separate this movie from the other Bourne movies. There were times when the plot became very slow and hard to follow, especially in the beginning."
1,Very bad,A very sad experience. Do not waste your money or time viewing this over rated movie. You would be better off watching mickey mouse.
3,No Jason Bourne,The movie was OK to watch and on pure merit hoped it would be more like a Jason Bourne movie but it is not - Matt Damon MADE those movies what they are .... it is hard to get used to a new cast like this and a different story line ...
3,Not bad movie,"Action, violence, and an open ended movie to make another sequeal. No ending, its like a pre-queal of another movie to come."
5,A clue for the 5th Bourne movie?,"When the doctor (talented Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz) puts Aaron Cross (equally-excellent 2-time Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner) ""under"" in order to perform medical tests on him, she asks him to count backwards from 100. Probably very few people realized that he said, ""You are beautiful...ninety-nine...ninety-eight...ninety-seven...."" IN RUSSIAN. When non-native speakers of a language have to ""think arithmetic,"" they almost always revert to their native language. Hmm... Perhaps there is more to Aaron Cross than meets the eye???"
2,Disappointing,"This film merely skims the top of the Bourne series, dipping a toe into action scenes, then abruptly ending without ever deveoping the characters into real people. I was very disappointed."
3,good movie,decent movie. not as good as original ones. worth renting. glad i didn't see it in the theater. hopefully next one will be better.
2,Wait for the TV version,"If you enjoyed the previous Bourne movies you will probably wish you had waited for this to come on TV, you would at least have a shot at one entertaining commercial as you will not find one on this movie.I am not sure a third would have worked even with Matt but it would have had a chance, this is a terrible knock off."
3,Its an OK movie.,"I have all the other Bourne movies and got this one to complete my collection. Geez, what a disappointment. It was ok, but nothing special, the others are much better."
5,Excellent new addition to the Bourne series and looks like there will be even more to come :),Great new story line to the Bourne series. I have read all the books and these are always non stop action and intrigue.
2,Real disappointment,"The trailers made it look like it would be exciting and a fun move to watch, but it wasn't, the first 3 were much better and I can watch them over and over, this is a one and done !"
3,Hard to follow,"It pales in comparison to the original ""Bourne"" movies. It was just okay. Good actors/actress but not so good storyline."
3,It's not your father's Bourne movie,"The Bourne Identity was startlingly good - it was everything that the James Bond series should have been but never sniffed. The second and third installments were not quite as good, but close. And despite the understandable departures from the Robert Ludlum books on which they are base, they conveyed the thrill-a-minute experiences of the books.Just as The Bourne Legacy is not from a Ludlum book (Erik Von Lustbader - is that his real name? - wrote it), it is also not from the Matt Damon-Doug Liman team that made the first three movies must-see action cinema. It's still an entertaining action movie, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weicz decent. Ed Norton reprises his usual detestable character. But the plot is predictable and the suspense absent. But hey, it's better than any Jason Statham movie (guilty pleasures, all of them)."
3,Average,Wife and I just finished watching this. I have to say the original movies are way better. Please rent this movie first. Movie started off like a Senior citizen running a 100 yard dash. I was hoping this would be great like the ones with Damon. It seems like every time the main character in a great series is replaced the quality of the movie suffers(the last Spider-Man movie is an example) the acting was good but the director may need to think about a career change. Some may like it some may not. But like I said before RENT it first.
3,Disappointed,"There was plenty of action in this movie,but I was disappointed with the ending. They just seemed to be setting up for a sequel. Will the real bad guys never get theirs?"
3,So-so,"The movie was entertaining, but nothing like the Bourne series we are used to. I bought the other three, won't buy this one."
4,Done in the style of the series...,But something seemed to be off in post production. The reused scenes from the previous movie were either filmed using different cameras or were processed differently.
2,Was not impressed,"This is nothing like the other Bourne movies. It's long, there's barely any plot, and barely any action. It was definitely a waste of $5 and 2 hours."
2,They should have stopped where the books ended....,"Neither my husband or I enjoyed this movie, and we loved the first three of the series. The storyline was not cohesive and seemed much more 'evil' than the previous movies. I've talked to others who enjoyed it but we did not."
1,sooo bad,This movie jumped the shark. A distant fourth in the series. i just wish i could get my $5 dollars and two hours back..
1,S****,"Don't waste your time or money! This is a s***** movie. Would have given it zero stars if possible, or negative one."
3,I like the movie; just not the abilitiy to download it to watch offline,"I have an asus transformer prine that plays it great while on a wifi network. I travel a lot and would like to download it to watch while flying. I cant seem to get it to download. It shows an icon to download but does nothing. If the purchases can be downloaded on many devices and not just Kindle products, then it would rate five stars in my book."
2,Let it go!!,"I think the Bourne legacy is over. I think Jeremy Renner is a great actor. He was just put into a bad role. No fault of his, as he did his best. No one pulls off Bourne like Mr Damon."
3,the music was wrong plot good not enough personal growth,the same as above also fights were a bit staged jason fights seemed more real his training seemed unrealastic the cut aways were from a better movie
3,its a rental,"I have the other bourne movies, but i didn't like this one. it was poorly made the story was there, just not fully developed"
2,Boring,This movie was boring and slow. We feel asleep several times and do not recommend this movie to anyone to rent or buy.
2,Bourne -- the Fugative!,"This was a pure waste of talent. Bourne always had a personality and a mission. In this endless run, chase and never solve anything outing, it plays like an episode from the old TV series 'The Fugative', except Bourne doesn't solve any real problems for anyone else either. It's sad to spend so much time and money making a film that has no heart, no soul, no satisfactory ending.I wish Hollywood would wake up. Characters make even a poor plot interesting, while special effects, explosions and chase scenes do nothing but make the audience wish the show would end."
3,Not as good as my imagined,"Somehow, this movie doesn't give you the magic feeling as the original Bourne movie. There are a lot plots that you feel like borrowed from somewhere else, for example, the opening scene is kind of deja vu from ""Hanna""."
5,Great movie to the bourne series!,"This is the perfect movie to the Bourne series. It ties everything in, and it adds a new twist to it all. I really think it could match up to bond."
3,Not as good as the first 3,Kind of just a repeat of scenes from the first 3. Seemed like the plot could have had more depth.
4,Good not great.,Ok movie and I'd recommend it but I didn't think it was as good as the first 3. I'm a fan of Jeremy Renner but Matt Damon was better.
3,Good film,"I liked this movie, it has some good action and suspenseful movies. If you like action films of this gere, you will probably enjoy this one."
3,Watch the triology before seeing this or you will be lost,"Very technical movie, full of action but if you hadn't watched all the borne movies right before watching this you have no idea whats going on. I am a huge fan of the Borne series but this movie doesn't have the same flow as the previous three did."
3,Meh Matt Damon Series is better,Meh Matt Damon Series is better. Strictly a rental. I would not buy this dvd. Plot was predictable. . .
3,Bourne Legacy is just ok.,"It's ok, but not great. Not as good as the first three. Confusing at the beginning. Probably better on big screen (not laptop)."
2,Sets the stage...,"It was okay. It does try to set the stage for a new thread of stories, but I was disappointed that it seemed to drag on many times."
3,Good Jason Bourne follow up,"Yes, another Bourne movie.Tied Legacy to other Bourne movies.Had action and a story.Not as intense as other Bourne movies"
4,Lots of action,"I would recommend this to those, that liked the other Bourne episodes.It is probably more FACT than fiction.Makes one reflect on our current events."
5,Super good movie,"Awesome movie. plenty of action like all Bourne movies.Looking for next, hopefully with Matt Damon and Jeremy Renner.Watch it!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,No Regrets,If you are a fan of the Bourne movies you will not be disappointed. No regrets from buying this movie. Looking forward to a sequel.
3,A little slow but very attractive!,"It could have had more action but it wasn't a bad movie. I like the new actor in it, it had action but I understand it needed to build the plot up and let you understand the character. Not bad just wan't my favorite but I'd watch it again."
3,Not worthy of the series.,Very disappointing. First half is a basic rehash of the series with the exception of the new characters. Looks like they took the out-takes from the other films to make half of this movie. Once you figure out what's going on you have one cool chase and that's about it.
4,Nice Sequel,"I really enjoyed Jeremy Renner's performance, understated but powerful. Action packed from beginning to end. Can't wait for the next one."
1,Bourne Bored,"Time to hang it up on this series....even the killing and action had no direction. Paid $22 for the Blu Ray, not a good investment."
1,Reborn Bourne Flat and Preachy,"I was a big fan of the first three movies. Apparently I am more of a Matt Damon fan than I thought. Don't waste your time. This one drags on, and has very little insofar as memorable moments or sequences."
2,Disappointing,"Does not touch the original ones! Special effects are OK but the story get somewhat disconnected form what it wants to be, which is I guess to entertain people. Too complicated to follow and if you want to connect it to the earlier ones with Matt Damon. Worth to watch it though."
3,Not as good as the original movies,"Lot of action but not much of a story line. personally I expected more after watching the trailers, the only saving grace was the action."
2,The Bourne Legacy a disappointment.,Long on action short on story line. I expected it to be as intense as the previous Bourne movies. Lacked any real story line and was a real disappointment. This could have been a great story but the writers dropped the ball.
2,Did not live up to my expectations,"The movie is ok, but not half as good as the previous Bourne movies. Plus you really need to watch more than once to be clear on what is happening."
3,Avergare Action Flick,"The movie was ok. It had good action sequences, and they did a decentg job of transitioning from Jason Bourne to Aaron Cross. definitely worth renting for the plane ride home or a lazy Winter's day."
5,Needs More than 5 Stars,"The Vanished Man is the best of the Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs mysteries. The book opens as a murder is comitted and the perpetrator ""vanishes"" from a locked room with no exit. Lincoln quickly finds himself pitted against a serial killer who is also a master illusionist. Each murder leads to another as the killer continues to misdirect Lincoln and the police with tricks of magic and illusion.In the Vanished Man, Lincoln is out of his element and sends Amelia out to look for an expert in the field of magic. He takes on an assistant who is an apprentice magician with problems and difficult relationships of her own. This additional character allows Deaver to reveal a more sentimental side of Lincoln Rhyme than we have previously seen in other novels in this series. It's a great read with suspense that never lets up from the opening to a surprise at the end."
5,A great read g,This book is great Lincoln rhyme is a great advesaryAlso the story holds your attention from start to finish cannot wait for the next
3,A Twist Too Far?,"In the Vanished Man, a killer is using every trick in the magicians manual, to murder innocent victims, and to lead the police in one direction then another. Has Lincoln Rhyme meet his match?At first, I found this book an enjoyable read. However, I felt, there were too many twists and turns, even by this author's standards. Some of the events and 'misdirections' (of which there is many!!) used by the killer seemed highly improbable to me, and had me thinking they were too far fetched, to be credible.I felt this undermined the storyline, and as the book progressed, I found myself becoming less and less interested in what the final outcome would be. Not a terrible book, but, certainly not the best, from this author."
3,Not Bad-But Not the Best Either,"In the Vanished Man, Lincoln Rhyme is once again trying to capture a killer that keeps getting away every time they are close to capturing him. The killer was labeled ""The Conjurer,"" and flees every homicide scene where he commits murder upon murder. Each killing becomes more diabolical, and as the minutes tick down, Rhyme and Sachs must move beyond the smoke and mirrors to prevent a terrifying act of vengeance.You had to keep reading this book to find out what happens next, but it wasn't as good as the other Rhyme books I've read."
5,His best book ever,"This was Deaver's best book ever---lots of twists. Great characterizations--even Lincoln Rhyme had more personality in this book. The illusions were great, especially the last one which I won't describe because it would spoil the fun. Never did I have a chance of predicting the ending. Good job."
2,Gloves Are Too Big,"Although we received the gloves in a timely manner, they are way too big for my son to wear. Both my husband and I were able to put the gloves on ourselves. Very disapointing."
3,The finisihing touch to the Darth Vader Costume,"These ""guntlets"" were great as the finishing touch to my son's Darth Vader Halloween costume, but they were really large! The description says Ages 3+, but they hardly stayed on my 8 year old, and in fact, because they were too big, they didn't stay on for long."
2,Way too big!!,"Got these for my 7 year old to go with his Darth Vader costume... Out of the box I noticed they were way TOO BIG! Even though it clearly says CHILD on the packaging... These gloves fit tightly on my hands, I could use them... I wear a adult size Medium..."
