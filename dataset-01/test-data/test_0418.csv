1,Bad Taste,"This protien works well to curb my appitite for hours on end, but it has a horrible taste and texture. The closest thing I can relate it to is chocolate-burned egg tasting boogers. I would not purchase this product again. I would, however, purchase from the vender again because it is not their fault that this protien tastes so bad."
2,Irritating Heroine,"I loved Skye's Draycott Abbey series, but it was shear will trying to finish this book. This heroine, Taylor was unbelievably selfish, argumentive, with no sense. She places people in danger because she thinks ""she's right"" and ""what could possibly be wrong?"". People were trying to ""protect her"" and all she could think of was herself. I liked Jack, no only was he a hunky SEAL- but had patience of a saint to put up with her.The plot was good, but had inconsistencies as described in other reviews. I would have rated this book 5 stars if it had a sharper heroine, more insight in ""Jack's mind"" and a smoother and snappy writing."
2,Such a disappointment.,"This book starts out promising, but then goes nowhere. Too many threads of the story line are introduced, but never followed up, such as Jack's culinary skills, which could have been used to humanize him, or the fact that Taylor finds out she is adopted. My biggest complaint is that there is very little about Taylor that is likeable. Her selfish, irresponsible behavior gets others killed and she doesn't seem to ever learn anything from it. I guess this is suppose to show how head-strong and loyal her character is, but I almost couldn't finish the book because of it. We never get inside Jack's head at all, so there isn't much appealing about him either, except that he is physically a hunk.I enjoyed Skye's Draycott Abbey series, so it is too bad this series has been such a disappointment (2000 Kisses was terrible also)."
3,Ammo Box,The slots are too small for the ammo. It is probably not the fault of the box. I should have researched it a little better.
4,Bottom down,"These boxes appear to be well constructed. Two notes.1. Box hing doesn't always stay open without help.2. Not a complaint, but 9x19 ammo needs to go in bottom down to keep them steady and make it easy to pull out of the case."
3,Items in the kit were different from what advertised.,"One of the three items was carrying case but the merchant sent holster clip case instead. It wasn't exactly what I wanted. However, I settled for the substitute because I didn't want to go through the trouble of sending it back to get it replaced."
1,Disappointment,"My grandchildren (ages 4 and 6) were very excited about this toy. But they were both too short to get the tension on the cord that was necessary to enjoy it. They kept trying, and then the platform split. I am sure the split was only a fluke, but it would be nice if there was a way to make the cord shorter. Otherwise this should be listed as appropriate for ages 8 and up."
4,the older the game the worse it looks,But its a given with the ps2 when playing on a HDtv. But there are exceptions the top game you expect to have good visuals do look good in hd somewhat. Not sure if its worth it but its up to you if you want to play your ps2 games with slight boost in color clarity. But most if not some of the graphical flaws will stick out especially older games.
2,Try Something Else,"The product works, but the plugs are fat. I managed to squeeze them into the jacks of my TV, but this is not something you should get. If you do get it, yes it will work, but I would not recommend it.Use it at your own risk."
1,Picture Was not clear,I know that my TV isn't the issue because I have my Wii Hooked up the same way. I am a bit more advanced with electronics so I did some testing. So I believe my issue is the cord. That is what I get for going cheap.
4,Very good quality,The cables worked flawlessly and the price at which it is difficult to find elsewhere. There are better but these are good.
3,"Good Picture, Poor Quality","This cable blows the composite cable out of the water-- the picture is sharper, colors are brighter, etc. Unfortunately, that awesome picture has started cutting out randomly during gameplay for about a second at a time. I've had it for less than a month and haven't even used it much. It is definitely the cable and not my PS2 or television (composite cable still works fine, as do other devices connected through the same component hookups on the TV). I'm not too disappointed, given that it only cost me a buck. Maybe I just got a dud."
1,Head Fell Apart,"I purchased this cable for my son's Playstation 2. It sat in the box until Christmas Day when it was given to him. We went to hook it up and the plastic around the port came apart, fell off, and the cables completely dismantled from the metal head. This all in just hooking it up for the first time and taking it right out of the package. I only paid $3.44 for it so it's not worth me returning it as I will end up paying that to ship it in the first place. What a piece of junk. I guess I got what I paid for!"
5,"Easily worth the price, to play old games on new TV's....","I just finally got around to buying these HD cables for my PS2. I used to either1. Play the PS2 on a older TV so it'd look better than AV cables on a LCD.Or2. Just deal with a smudgy,blurry,choppy looking game session playing it on a newer TV.I can easily say that this is a great investment! I bought it for 1 penny + like $5.99 shipping. The cables came fast & looks way,way better! And it now has motivated me to get my Dreamcast to look awesome on my 1080 LCD TV's. If you wanna play your PS2 on your new LCD,Plasma, or LED TV's....I highly recommend this!!! It will come in at 480P. But trust me, it looks a 100x better. I unfortunately didn't get the PS3 that would play my PS2 games. And my 360 doesn't play my original Xbox games for the most part. If you can find cables like this for any old system you won't be let down!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!,This product ceased to work after using it after one week of receiving it. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. Purchase higher priced component cables.... you get what you pay for. In essence...this product does not deserve one star on Amazon's rating system.
1,A cable built for a PS2 that barely fits in the PS2,"It's a cable, a rather cheap cable. The connector barely fits into the system..I had to jam it, and thought I snapped a connector on the PS2. Once the cable is in, it starts to slide out because of the ill-fit. I do not recommend this product, it is junk. I would have rated it 0, but cannot. I can see why this was 4 dollars."
4,Decent,"This product is decent, was late getting shipped out but arrived still within the ETA. Only issues I've been having with this product is there are some graphical issues when the power fluctuates and I can't connect it to my stereo because the cable itself has a choke point where it splits into the individual plugs from a single cable."
3,Can be made compatible with XP PC's and up.,"If you are looking to buy this doll to use and play with and you have XP through Windows 7 all you need to do is set the compatibility to run in Windows 98 or 95.Before you install right click on the setup icon and got to properties, then from that pop up change the ""run in compatibility"" drop down menu to 95 or 98. Also, don't forget to change the properties on the application/run icon. I hope this will help with those that wish to play with her. I hope to purchase this doll in the fuuture please let me know if this has helped any one."
2,"Good for history, bad for basic concepts","If you want to know all about how Buddhism spread from its origin; this is the book for you. On the other hand, if your looking for a book that explains basic buddhist belief and practice... Look else where. Breif descriptions of karma and selflessness, Extensive detail of where the dharma spred to. So for beginners like myself, I would pass on this one."
4,Great product,"I love the style of these only draw back is they are straight and not offset, i looked far and wide for offset ones at a reasonable price and settlec for these. Very good for general use"
5,Great Information,"So far I have only read a few chapters, but I have received a lot of useful information.Hopefully, I can finish the book before next school year and use it to plan my curriculum."
5,must read,"Great two examples summarized: Whatever written in your business card, you must learn data design. How important to present your data to help your team, your company or your audiences to take the right decision."
5,castor oil,The product is great. I used it for hot castor oil packs on my bladder and it worked. I had benign but transitional tumours inside my bladder and after applying the castor oil packs the tumours shrunk! This particular kind works the best.
4,"Entertaining, but easy to put down","I thought this book was definitely entertaining, yet not so engrossing that I just couldn't put it down. If you're looking for a continuation of the characters that are part of the Ballisters and/or Beaumont social sphere, then you'll surely enjoy this book. If you haven't read the story of Sebastian Ballister, you'll want to read that first prior to reading this book - there is a significant amount of back story that will be difficult to appreciate otherwise.Overall, I would recommend this book to Loretta Chase fans, but not to any first-time readers."
5,Rhapsody delight,This is one of the most amazing concerts i have seen. The conductor Seiji Ozawa inspired the musicians and audience in a way i have never seen before. The integration of the jazz trio was equally amazing. The music was just superb and clearly all of the musicians took great delight in producing it.
1,Horrible Book,"I don't even know why I bought this book. Its repetitive, poorly written and does not state anything interesting. Don't waste your time or money."
2,YAWN,"not well done.. all over the place and badly organized.. I just couldnt get through it.. to much jumping around and more about the laywers behavior and clothing styles then the case it seemed.Read Sharon Rochas book, For Laci.. that is a book you will never forget.. by pass this one."
2,Slow going,"I wouldn't say this book is poorly written, but it's pretty boring and drawn out considering the twists and turns of this case."
3,An interesting look at jurors and the deliberation process,"This book is not really about the murder of Laci Peterson. It covers the trial of her husband and how the jurors came to their conclusion, so if you're looking for more facts and evidence about the crime, look elsewhere. This book centers on ordinary people finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances, living a double life and unable to discuss it with anyone, the pressure of knowing the nation is watching ... Seeing how these people lived and meshed during deliberations was riveting. The book is a bit long, though. I wish an editor had taken a firmer hand."
5,Very Interesting book,"I have read every book about the Trial. This was good reading, actually hearing what the jury thought about the whole trial and how Scott's actions throughout the whole investigation got him convicted."
1,A waste of a few hours,Boring book. Although a perfect platform for jurors who eased their way into the trial looking to make a quick buck after the verdict.
2,just ok,This was a good book for those who know nothing about the case. If you've read the countless other Scott Peterson books you really won't learn anything new here. The only good chapters were about the deliberations and the dismissed jurors. Strawberry Shortcake's letter writing to Scott is quite creepy and inappropriate. She needs to focus more on getting her life together than on her obsession with Mr. Peterson.
2,The A-List Malibu Sun,"I purchased this whole series for my daughter and she found that this book was a collection of the first three novels by Zoey; The A-List, Girls on Film and Blonde Ambition. She read about 5 minutes and started thumbing through the rest of the book and found it to be a repeat of what she'd already read."
1,what is this?,is this like a spin off to the A-list?? or a different serise? I've never seen it before. Ant they have no things to tell you what its about! so please somebody tell me because im very curious of this book!
3,Great $1 Rental. 2.5 Stars,"It is entertaining, but having a weak storyline makes it not worth owning. Good action and production, but an uneven plot and story that sometimes stalls or makes little sense."
1,I'm Waiting.....,"I am waiting for a movie about a Black superhero in which the main character is not Rastus, nor a fool, nor a criminal, nor a clown. Hancock ain't it. To make matters worse, this super-powerful super-being takes his orders from a little white guy: ""OK boss, I's dos whats you sez, hyuck, hyuck.."". Insulting.Will Smith is strange, or rather his career choices are strange. He'll star in a good film like I Am Legend, then do this mess. Just when I start liking him as an actor, this ode to odium comes out. And the jokes in the film are so stupid, Austin Powers quality jokes (hyuck,hyuck).The DVD itself has plenty of special features, but no apology (I was hoping that one was on the DVD). I know most people will still want to see this - just rent it and don't pay too much for the rental."
2,What a stupid movie,This movie is so utterly stupid that I didn't even finish it. I can't believe that Will Smith and Charlize Theron agreed to acting in it.
3,"If you are analytical, you know what I'm talking about","The first half of the movie was great, but the second half leaves a lot of things open. The writer of the movie should have reviewed the story more. I won't ruin the movie for everyone else that haven't seen the movie. If they make a Hancock 2 with closing the loops, I'll like it more. Just watch carefully with the second half to know what I'm talking about."
4,Entertaining! Will Does His Thing!,"Quick and easy: Will Smith does a great job. He has grown as an actor. This movie is entertaining. There is drama, action, romance, comedy, violence, and some unexpected language and situations that are not exactly little kid friendly. HANCOCK takes real life situations and shows the struggle and growth to overcome them. It's about taking responsibility, taking charge, and making a change when change is needed. I liked it, and because I am always looking for a positive message in a movie, this movie gave me what I wanted by using a serious situation in a dramatic yet amusing way. Others found quirky faults with this, but hey, it's a SUPERHERO MOVIE for goodness sake."
2,"Sorry, No ""Superhero"" Here!","The point of Hancocks origin has been missed by it seems all who have reviewed here. His female ""co-angel"" says that they were called ""gods"" or ""angels"" in times past. There is nothing ""superhero"" here at all, but an adapted story of the fallen angels in Genesis chapter six who have sexual relations with women, then they lose their ability (or so it appears) to return to a ""spirit form"", which allows God to kill them thru the flood (Genesis 7).Realize that all mythology has at its beginning some element of truth. This truth is found in the Holy Bible."
1,"""Dumb"" and ""stupid"" would be words to describe this film.","I have to agree with the one-star reviews. Leonard Maltin's quote is accurate -- he says""It's bad enough that the material stinks, but director Berg shoots it in nausea-inducing handheld style,with pointless macro-closeups of the actors."" A waste of talent in a dumb movie. One star for some of theOK special effects. I'm glad I saw it, recorded from TV. I skimmed towards the end just to see how it ended.Happily, it did finally end. If you must see this film, rent it, or just wait until it gets on TV. I seldom use the word ""crap"" to describe a movie, but in this case, I think it applies."
1,Yuck!,"This movie was lacking in writing, acting, and directing. The story line must have been created and written by middle school creative writing students. This film is serious o's and 1's pollution, and should come with a warning label ... watch only during extreme insomnia attack!"
2,Hancock,"Good special effects, but the sex scene didn't fit the story line which was tired and predictable. The actors seemed like they were calling it in, and the direction appeared to be by committee."
2,HORRIBLE DIRECTING!!,"First half of the movie was a comedy like My Super Ex-Girlfriend, Second half turned serious like Unbreakable. Seemed like a good script that needed a good coemdy director, instead it got Peter Berg. I liked all of Peter Berg's other movies, but now it seems that he thinks he needs to film with a handheld camera and shake it constantly in order to make a good movie. There are several scenes in which people are just sitting at a table talking while the camera shakes back and forth. This movie showed me what a hack Peter Berg is at directing."
2,was not a blu ray essentials,It was not what i was expecting it was hancock from 2008 i was expecting the blu ray essentials but you get what you pay for i think it was only $6
3,Lacks a storyline,"This movie lacked a full storyline but it did have some good action. Without a good storyline the movie made little sense. It turns out that Hancock (played by Will Smith) is some type of superman-like being but it doesn't explain where he came from, who made him, his purpose, etc. He's basically just some random superhero in a city. Then a woman pops into the story and she's also a superman-like being. It again, lack of details and background story on her."
2,rent don't buy,"This movie was a disappointment. The original premise of a super hero who has human emotional faults had hope but that is where the good news ends. I'm trying to be positive but if it wasn't for the whale scene and maybe at the most, 3 other moments of humor the overriding weakness of plot sinks this movie."
2,Even the great cast can't save this movie,"Other than the occasional comic relief, there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater and bought it used."
5,"Fantastic, good looking knives","I remember as a kid my dad had a carving knife by LamsonSharp. He'd take it out for thanksgiving and easter and then hand wash and dry it and put it away in it's case. He was a meat cutter so he knew knives.These knives are cast, not stamped, so they feel solid without a lot of flex. They are heavier than low quality knives but not too heavy. The rosewood handle is thick enough that the handles feel more square than cheaper knives (which tend to be flatter). This makes them very easy to hold. They cut through things like a warm knife would cut through butter. Even my wife is impressed by their ease of use.These are expensive but over the past 25 years we have bought and thrown away dozens of knives. In the long run these should be practical and we'll pass them onto our kids. The factory offers to replace any that become worn or damaged, and to resharpen them for free so there will be no reason to ever throw them away."
5,A strategy blowout,"Advance wars is probably the best title out for the GBA system. Although the cartoonish ghaphics are deciving, the gameplay and stategy is awesome. I have never played something more interesting on a handlheld yet. There are tons of units that you get to control. Bombers, Tanks, Rockets, and artillery are all included in this awesome title. Advance Wars is the game to get!!!"
5,Tremendous,"Advance Wars for gameboy advance is really fun. It's challenging, but that's what you want right? You don't want a game so easy that you beat it the day you get it. So, if you like challenging games, get it. Also, it's rated e, so your parents will probobly let you get it."
3,"advaced wars good, bad or soso?","advanced wars is definetly about multiplayer. One reason is there are two practialy impossible levels which eventualy stops you from playing 1player (you try beating the last level without giving up!) I know this might stun a few gamers but I don't think this game is worth 40 or 50 dollars maby not even 20 or 30! the rest of this game is good (graphics, gameplay, etc.)Sorry but this just isn't one of my favorite games."
2,"Sadly, a dud.","This project looks so promising. Get together some fine instrumentalists, invite some famous singers, work over some classic tunes. Well, the instrumental tracks are fine (Anger plays well throughout). Everything else -- with the exception of Willie Nelson's affecting reading of 'Hard Times Come Again No More' -- is rotten. Jane Sibbery makes an utter mess of 'Shenandoah' -- hard to do, as anyone who can hold a tune can make this song work. The reprise, which features Sibbery teaching the tune to an infant, is embarrassingly awful. And Tim O'Brien should buy Sheila Jordan's 'Lost and Found' -- he might get some ideas on how to sing 'The Water is Wide'. Those unfamiliar with these beautiful tunes will get the wrong impression; those who love them should steer well clear."
3,&#151;Beautiful Watch&#151;,"This is a very beautiful watch and has a classic look.I would give this watch 5 stars if it had a mechanical movement. For me, a wind up ticking watch seems to be alive, it has a 'Soul' so to speak. By making this watch with a quartz movement Timex has made a beautiful watch but is lacking the 'Ticking' that Timex is fameous for.Still, a great value for only $30."
1,Truly Boring,This is the first book that I set aside without finishing. I'm at a loss as to how it won a National Book Award. I have no problem with the structure - it is a pointless book with no plot and uninteresting characters.
2,Boring much?,"Being a senior in High School, I guess ""Charming Billy"" wasn't the best book for me to read. My attention span could not last while reading the endless pages of boring babble. The plot to this book was on the right track and it had potential to be a classic novel. Yet, there was no action to attract me, and my mind started to wonder. Not only was it very boring, I found that the introduction of so many characters that had insignificant roles to the plot was overall confusing. Maybe my dislike for this book was due in part to my age. I don't belive this is a good read for a teenager, but might reccomend it to adults."
2,I'm glad I just borrowed this book from the library.,"I looked forward to knowing Maeve from the first page. Neither she, nor I, were fulfilled."
1,Could not finish it,"One star is pretty stingy, I know, but I just couldn't get through this book. Books without plots and action can be interesting if the characters are fun, eccentric or weird enough, but there was no one in this novel like that. Billy was not charming. Maybe it would have gotten better but I just couldn't stick it out. I'm starting to get very suspicious of books that have won awards. I've found that a lot of the Oprah Club picks are depressing. Maybe this is the new requisite for literary awards: Boring and depressing. If it's too much fun I guess it can't be that good."
2,"Charming, but...","This is a sweet, thoughtful, intelligently written book...but what was all the hoopla about? While Billy's story is alternately amusing and sad, it never achieves the tragic dimensions that would make it great literature. Ordinary man, ordinary book."
2,much ado about nothing. A disappointing read.,"The author's reputation and the ""hype"" surounding Charming Billy prompted me to purchase and read the book. I wish I had read the reviewers' comments beforehand. I had to re-read the first half of the book to determine who the narrator was. This was very distracting. Halfway through, I really couldn't care about any of the characters. The lyrical prose saved the story, but I found the book boring, repetitious and forgettable. Prize-winning, I think not."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz......,"I have 3 things to say about this book: 1. DITTO the comments of John Sollami (Stamford, CT); No Charm in Billy. 2. Shouldn't the National Book Award mean something? 3. Can't we have the option of a NO STAR rating? I think this book would qualify."
4,"Likeable, but national book award?","First of all, I am far far removed from the irish roman catholic new york milleau that McDermott paints, and I do think she describes it well enough for someone not indoctrinated in its culture. I can imagine that those part of that group REALLY appreciate it.The author protrays her hero, the dead alcoholic, as a human being as well as an alcoholic, which is touching to me. There are some other poignant characters as well.The primary flaw of this book is the pacing. Boy.....does....it...move...slowly. That alone is annoying enough to knock it down a star.As my title suggests, I will have to do some research on why this one got a national book award. It's good, but not THAT good."
2,Vastly overrated,"In the past, I have used award winners as a guide to read some outstanding modern fiction such as ""All The Pretty Horses"", ""Cold Mountain"" and ""Snow Falling on Cedars"". Maybe my expectations were too high, but ""Charming Billy"" was not nearly as enjoyable as those listed. It was a chore to finally finish it. It was better by far than anything Danielle Steele ever wrote, but I don't understand why it won any awards."
2,How did this book win such a major award?,"Imagine someone writes 243 pages and then drops the manuscript on the floor. The order gets all jumbled but instead of putting them back in order the publisher produces the book as is. Well, that's what you get with Charming Billy. I know some people are so vain as to consider great literare something that is difficult to follow (like Faulkner). But McDermott is no Faulkner and this is certainly not the quality of book that should win the National Book Award. The story wasn't bad but it was poorly presented. Our reading group read this book and every member just labored through this book, griping all the way. If this truly was the best that American authors had to offer in 1998, then perhaps the publishing houses should simply shut down for a year or so until authors get the filth and bile out of their systems."
1,"Hard to read, depressing, boring book.","The writer tells you the outcome first then drags you through hundreds of pages of run on, awkwardly written sentences. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. It did when I finished the book and went on to read Janet Evanovich's Two for the Dough. Don't waste your time on Billy."
2,This book has to be better than this to get an award!!!!,"""Charming Billy"" was not worth the wait I endured to get it. Oprah must be losing her marbles to recommend some of her recent books. This book took me forever to read, and I'm a very fast reader. I could hardly wait to finish it and take it back!!!"
1,Dull-dull-dull,"I am an avid reader and rarely do not finish what I begin reading. I began this book with a very open mind, but mid-way could not go any further. One of the few 'wish I had never purchased' books I have obtained. May appeal to some, but I had a very hard time becoming interested. Characters hard to follow; a lot of skipping around without explanation."
2,Who's on first?,"I don't think I was unusually distracted while reading Charming Billy, but I could not keep the narration straight. I kept flipping back to see who was being described. Especially annoying were the unclear pronoun references. It took me most of the book to separate Billy's mother from Denis's. Also regarding Billy's infatuation with Eva: Another reviewer hit the nail on the head with a Freudian typo. He/she meant to type ""Billy barely knew her,"" but it reads barley. John Barleycorn is indeed the culprit here and I question if an Irishman ""in his cups"" hasn't been been dealt with a bit too often and in a more satisfactory way by other writers."
2,disappointingly over-rated,"Well, I finished it. The reviewers say that this novel cannot be relegated to plot. That's for sure, I found it hard to follow and boring. The reviewers say the emotional content is restrained, subtle. I say that with a couple of notable exceptions, the emotional content is numbing.Imo, the only redeeming features of this book are the finely drawn characters and the realistic portrayal of the tedium of daily life. (No wonder it was boring.)I think that this novel would have made a terrific short story. I'm sorry I didn't get to read it in ""The New Yorker."""
2,"Just like Harry Chapin's ""Taxi""!","No characterization. Who is Eva? and what makes him carry the torch for her all his life? We know that Billy is a pleasant drunk, and that's all we know about any character in this book. Billy drank himself to death. Near the end we find out a secret. Before that is 200 pages of obvious--why am I reading this?--filler. I'm NY Irish myself, but was frustrated by the paucity of culturalisms I could relate to. Notice not many reviews for this book? Speaks for itself; most people without anything nice to say don't say anything at all. I see why they call this an ""upset winner"" of the book award. It is on the slight, trite side"
4,"a stirring, lyrical novel","Many of the criticisms of this book take issue with the fact that this story is not told in a straightforward way. I think that is what makes it such a fine novel -- from the opening scene when family members gather to remember Billy, the plot dances around a few major plot events to give the perspective of different family members. Along the way, the reader is given an inside view of several generations of this extended Irish family with moving portraits of loss and longing weaving their way through the narrative. The novel is very evocative and recreates an old fashioned New York/Long Island neighborhood of Irish friends and neighbors and their inextricable ties to each other. There are some heartbreaking scenes, particularly when Billy travels to Ireland to visit his old love's grave. The plot is not what makes this an enticing novel; rather it is the meandering plot line and side bars that give it depth and emotion."
3,My book group is mad at me.,"On the strength of the National Book Award, I recommended this book to my reading group. The feedback from my peers? Depressing, tough to read, can't get into it, etc. Due to the many nuances, I would suggest reading it in one setting if possible--then you're not lost when you pick it up now and then. My opinion? It will be a better read the second time around."
1,"Hard to follow, not very interesting","Like many who have reviewed this book, I found this story hard to follow and even more difficult to get into. An alcoholic fool would have been a more accurate description of Billy than was ""charming"". I managed to finish the book in the vain hope that the story would get better but it did not. The story was just plain sad and not very redeeming. In fact, throw in some colorful language and a prostitute and you would have ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with Irish people."
2,Gullible Billy,"There's artistry and perceptiveness in this tale of betrayal and deception, woven through the accounts of major and minor players. Unfortunately, so little of the story comes to us from the romantic hero himself, that there is virtually no emotional connection with tragic Billy. The story is mostly told by his cousin Dennis's daughter, who had little or no contact with Billy. Even at the climax of the story, when Billy unexpectedly meets his lost love Eva again after 30 years of believing she is dead, the scene fails to convey the shock, betrayal, amazement, or whatever it is he is feeling. There is a moving portrayal of the dismal lives endured by other characters, such as Billy's unfortunate wife Maeve. However, there is too much irrelevant detail about minor characters and places, seemingly there just to expand a very slim story line. Billy does not convince as a charmer, nor as a tragic hero, he is little more than a shadowy excuse for a wasted life."
2,Beautifully written BUT no place to go,"I give plaudits to Alice McDermott's writing style -- she works hard to describe the feelings, flashbacks, and memories of Dennis' daughter as she reflects on the life and death of the tragicomedic character Billy Lynch. But her prose got bogged down into a journey into somewhere and nowhere. After a while, I got a headache simply trying to figure out just who McDermott was talking about. At the end, the message of the book was unclear -- was it about the need for redemption for a 30-year-old lie? was it about family values? was it about....what? Sorry to say, but this is certainly not one of her best works."
4,"a thoughtful, well-written tale",I knew in the middle of reading this story that I would not soon forget it. McDermott's book is full of questions that matter- what do we owe those we love? how do we create each other's histories and what effect do the stories told about us have? are truth and myth equally powerful in our daily lives? McDermott tells the story beautifully and lets readers come to their own conclusions and ponder their own histories.
2,A best seller should be good...NOT,"I bought Charming Billy because it was on the best seller list. What a disapointment. It started off fairly well but never got better. I had to stop half way through because it was just so uninteresting. The main (dead) character was pathetic in all his stupidity and alcoholism. I'll read the readers reviews from now on, not just the ""official reviewers"" and maybe I'll get a more accurate picture of what to expect."
5,Very good for first exposure to financial markets,"This book is not an advanced book on financial markets, but it is a good introductory book. I use this book for my undergraduate teaching. Both I and students are happy about the coverage of the book. It is well organized and well written. Improvements will be valuable in the derivatives markets and risk management areas."
5,Loved It!,My daughter who is 7 is very creative and she just loved this lamp because she was able to design it to match her room.
5,SNAPDRAGON,"THIS IS A LOVELY PLANT. I AM GOING TO PUT THEM IN LARGE BASKETS ALONG OUR RETAINING WALL. THEY WILL COME UP JUST HIGH ENOUGH OVER THE BASKET SO EVERYONE GOING BY CAN ENJOY. THEY MAKE LOVELY BORDER FLOWERS TOO. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND FREE. SO I SAVED A BUNCH OF MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY. AND IF YOU ORDER FROM THEM YOU WILL TOO. THEY WILL DEFINEITY BE ON MY LIST FOR FLOWERS NEXT YEAR. I GOT 40,000 SEEDS. CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MANY SEEDS THAT IS AND HOW MANY PLANTS. WOW,"
5,BRILLIANT!,"This record has always been one of my favourite Nilsson recordings. I have both the LP versions: mono and stereo, the first given to me from my parents in 1965 when I was only 15 years old. What a voice, technique and - brilliant top notes! The aria from Nabucco: I would give it 10 stars if possible. At this price a ""must"" in any operatic CD collection."
2,Verdi Needs A Real Musician,"Birgit Nilsson, as wonderful as she is...was not suited to Verdi, especially to Abigaille and Lady Macbeth.-her Italian is bad (the vowels) and she seems to have no idea what she is saying-she is devoid of a good coloratura technique-she sings off pitch in a couple of the Macbeth arias-she should've just cut the cabaletta to 'Anch'io dischiuso un giorno'...she slides up and down the scale like an overweight person wearing spandex on a wet slideShe is fabulous in Puccini and Wagner...where all she has to do is sing...and not think about being a musician.AND what horrible conducting and loud brass! Verdi on steroids."
4,very nice stick horse,the detailing on this stick horse is very nice!!! got it for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday & she loves it!
5,Stick Pony,"When my sister suggested this as a gift idea for my horse loving niece, I was skeptical. This is not a fancy, electronic toy. This is a slightly updated version of the stick horses we played with when we were little. However, she was 3 when she got this and she LOVED it. She is 4 now and doesn't play with it quite as much. However, her two two year old brother and 2 year old nephew both play with it quite often. It has held up well over the past year, even though it has been enjoyed by 3 toddlers."
1,Cute buy broke quickly,"My toddler is destructive like any 2 year old boy. He broke this within 20min. I tried to hot glue gun it back together but it didn't hold up. Very pretty, but just to look at not to play with."
4,Very cute!,It is so cute but was disappointed when we could not get the sound to work. Took my husband some time to wiggle things around and then it finally worked and has ever since. My grandson loves it.
4,Music from the Lost Provinces Old Time String Bands from Ashe County,This is one of my favorite Old Time CDs and I do not listen to anything but Old Time.Great CD!!!
4,another excellent release from old hat.,"i like or love everything that i've heard from the folks at old hat. it is simply a marvelous label that specializes in old-time music releases. ""music from the lost provinces"" is another outstanding cd from them. twenty-two fine tracks from 1927-1931 presented with very good sound quality. a cornucopia of fiddlers and guitar-pickers and banjo players and hillbilly singers. this is a must for all fans of old-time rural music. magic from a bygone era."
5,it did what i wanted,My neighbor moved a trampoline just opposite my bathroom window. Like most people i like privacy when in my bathroom. Shutters are expensive and would take too long. So i came to Amazon and as usual i found just what i needed. It was easy to put up and did what i wanted. My bathroom is private again.
1,Didn't work,I bought this for my original playstation 2 because I lost my original during a move. It didn't fit right and when I forced it in it still didn't work. Waste of money
2,PS2 Power cord,"This cord is not a true PS2 power cord the PS/2 end is supposed to have a rounded side and a squared side to match the input side of the PS/2. This cord has two rounded sides. It can be forced to work, but it not correct."
5,a very sexy Christopher Walken,"Strange movie, creepy almost. But I loved it so much that I had to go to Venice. I had to see it for myself. The story is about a couple who lost the magic in their marriage and go to the romantic Venice to find it again. Instead they find this other couple, kind of strange but seductive and their intentions are not the best. A sensual movie about romance and death. The end is at least a huge surprise, you'll never see that coming. I confess, I like Christopher Walken and therefore the movie. It's creepy, shoking!, decadent, seducitve...everything, nice setting and great music. Watch it. You might love it or hate it, but you won't get bored and won't forget it."
2,Below Average,"While watching this movie I got the idea it was completely faithful to the book; and according to other reviewers this is indeed the case. perhaps that was the problem. Perhaps the movie should have been embellished more. that being said, the movie is slow in pace and despite the fantastic scenery, is not a movie I'd rcommend. I'm glad I bought it for only $7.99 at B&N; in 2004. I'd have been angry otherwise.Leonard Maltin's Movie Review gave this flick One And Half Stars. I'd give it the same review, but can't on Amazon so I will instead give Two Stars for the remarkable setting and great wardrobe. Otherwise this movie has no ""soul.""A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
1,"Eh...,","I won't go into too much detail here. Suffice it to say, it very accurately follows the Ian McEwan novel, however, the characters are unlikeable, and the cinematography is very dated. Read the book, instead...it'll save you the horror of 80s hairstyles and clothing."
5,Clear and complete,"The author does a good job of explaining HDTV and surround sound clearly. Not a book you'd read cover to cover at the beach, but if you just dip into it when you need to know something, it does its job quite well."
2,Too Basic,"I wish I hadn't purchased this book, I didn't learn anything I didn't already know.If you have ever walked into a Best Buy, you probably know as much as this book will provide.This is only for someone who has not bought any AV equipment in the last 20 years."
3,Not durable with small children,"I purchased this for my 4 & 2 1/2 year old so they could play inside. The spiderball is great as the legs keep it from rolling all over the place, an issue I have with every game that comes with anything round since I have hardwood floors. The problem I had is with the webbing in the paddles. The pictures show that you can pull back the webbing to catapult objects. Unfortunately for us, the webbing on both paddles only lasted about 30 minutes before each one ripped. We've managed to tie the ripped webbing with elastics but it's pretty sad looking. Bummer, it looks like such fun. I was hoping to play outside this Spring."
5,So far a good book,"This book explains things very well and it has many examples which help to clear up everything. I feel that many books leave out examples, but this book has a lot of examples and I suggest this book mainly for that reason. I have not finished the book, but I definitely suggest it to anyone interested in learning about finite automaton and related topics."
1,there was no demon,"In the case of Anneliese Michel there was no demon.The two priests and her parents killed her with starvation,and were sent to jail after her death.There were no SUPERNATURAL phenomena: no levitaiton,no objects movment, no demons. At least this was the conclusionof the commission of the German Bishop-ConferenceSee your self:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneliese_Micheland also:Emily Rose: The Real Story of Anneliese Michel's Exorcismhttp://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_1253.html"
1,No,"My review for this product is bad. What I searched for was the DVD of this movie, it did not show me it was for the PSP. So this is a rip off."
1,I rather help Osama Bin Laden destroy America then watch this film,"This is a religious propaganda masquerading as horror film. The courtroom scenes were interesting but ridiculous, mostly because the filmmakers try to convince us by any means that this possession really happened. The exorcism sequence is scary (sort of) and thrilling yet too long in my opinion. Jennifer Carpenter does an okay job screaming and making idot funny faces, while Laura Linney's talent is once again waste in a movie that doesn't do her justice."
3,MY REVIEW: 3/5,"Starting off, for anyone who thinks this is a horror movie there absolutely wrong. This movie is based on the death of Emily Rose. It's half thriller/courtroom drama. Yes there was a story and good actors but Emily Rose made me laugh while she was possesed. Overall, I guess this movie is worth watching once."
4,Very Scary!,"It is d*mn near impossible to scare me, but this movie temporarily crossed the threshold! A deep inside look into the spiritual realm! Laura Linney was great. A very funny part when the camera shot an eyesview of the priest running down the steps to get outside of his house! i'm smiling as i type this."
3,It's more like a psychological drama. It's definitely not a horror movie.,"It's more like a psychological drama. It's definitely not a horror movie. It deals with religous faith, science and something that science can't explain. The acting is Ok. One of another good thing is it's based on a true story.It's worth viewing."
3,Missed opportunity,"Good story idea but something seems to be missing here. I've seen Laura Linney perform better, and the rest of the cast didn't really make up for the difference. Okay for a rental but this movie is mostly over-rated."
3,Pretty good actually!,"I didn't go see this in the theatres when it was released back in 2005. All the TV spot previews showed all the supernatural shenanigans and I judged it based sorely on those thinking it was another silly Exorcist rip-off.This isn't The Exorcist or some other cheap knock off. It isn't even about horror or gore or some supernatural spectacle. This is more of a court room drama with some fringe creeps that makes it unique. The performances are pretty good all around and the film does have a few good creepy moments. It surprised me how effective the unseen creepy parts crept up on me. You'll know when you get to that moment, just be sure to grow some nads and watch it late at night. Enjoy!"
3,Déjà Vu,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodAs far as satanic possession films go, this one is pretty good. Based on a true story (Isn't half of them anymore?), ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" does have it's devilish pleasures, & it's creepy skin crawlers, but one has to think, have we not seen this all before, & better done? Yet, this is well worth the watch for those so inclined to be possessed by possession films!""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" 2005"
4,Awesome Book,The book The Attributes of God is an awesome well written book.Providing insight and causing you to really think about who God is.... and his true Power and what he represents. I would reccommend this boook to anyone who is looking to get a greater understanding of our God.
2,A Classic Work Poorly Reproduced,"I was teaching on the attributes of God in Sunday school and decided on this book for the class. I have an earlier copy of the book, but ordered several from Amazon which are now published by Wilder. In each chapter there were some glaring mistakes such as ""bath"" instead of ""hath"" and references to a webpage. The book seems to have been scanned or copied from a website. Sadly, poor reproduction distracts from what is otherwise an excellent work."
2,"Same title, different book","Unfortunately, this book is headed for the library, possibly to be turned to at another time. Apparently, it has the same title as one favorite from decades ago, but doesn't measure up to what I recall that book covering. It's likely that the author's name just wasn't remembered."
1,Amazon Makes Money From Unedited Editions! A W Pink is Great...,"Watch out for ""print-on-demand"" ""new"" paperbacks of old Christian books or Kindle editions that are not actually edited! Amazon publishes these Kindle editions at no cost to them, and then rakes in money from people who don't realize it's not even a clean edition of the book. ""New"" paperbacks of rare books are being digitally reproduced but not edited, enabling the publisher to gain the market without any work.All of A W Pink's works are available for free in both ePub and Kindle formats:[...]"
4,just works and well.,They work. Sound quality is fine. Yes my over the ear cup headphones are better but seriously these are so light and comfortable to wear. Battery life is about 4 hours. I have had them for over a year and I really enjoy not having a cable attached to my head. and the Bluetooth is awesome. I can be working listening to my ipod. If my phone rings they drop the ipod and pick up the phone call and then when done go back to the ipod just the way you expect things to work. Honestly my best purchase ever.
1,"Dull, dull, dull","Without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever tried to read. An unpleasant man named Buzz gets shot and run over in the first chapter, probably the best thing ever to happen to him, considering his screwed-up family and gaggle of so-called friends. Hard to follow plot, made worse by multiple uninteresting characters to keep track of. I usually enjoy true-crime books, but this one made me yearn (well, almost)for a good old-fashioned Danielle Steele bodice-ripper; at least they have some semblance of a cohesive plot."
1,This magazine is entirely in German!,"Because there is no picture for this magazine and no description, I foolishly thought this was an American magazine called Plexus, which is about medical transcription. Whatever the magazine is about, it is ENTIRELY in German. It needs to carry a description so that people don't waste the money on the magazine unless they are German!"
2,Get what you pay for,"The ear piece and charger have worked fine thus far, but the phone cover tore the minute it came out of the package and I tried to put it on my phone. The plastic is just cheap. For $10, who can complain?"
5,The Circuit Is Really Heatin' Up!,"I have had Mario Kart Super Circuit for quite some time now, but just recently I wrote this review. This is a truly outstanding game that I'm sure everybody will enjoy. There are plenty of different game modes and characters to keep you satisfied for quite a while. You can select from one of five different cups to race in, plus one unlockable SNES version of the cup. You can also choose the difficulty level. From highest to lowest they are: 150cc, 100cc, and 50cc. Try to beat every track in every cup on every skill level.Now, for those of you who don't usually select the Racing Genre, I think this should be an exception. I'm more of an Action/Adventure type of guy, but I tested this game at Target and fell in love with it. It's a great game for people of all ages as well as for people that don't normally enjoy the racing genre...If you buy this, it's a game I'm sure you'll never forget."
5,Best game I have ever played,It has great controls and really fun challenges. I played it all day! You will definetly like it.
5,Great Choice!,"I have played many racing games and I must say that this is a GREAT choice. The GBA graphics are very impressive. However, I highly recommend you purchase a light for your GBA, it's a sound investment. I feel this games really comes into its own when you play it in a multiplayer mode. I also liked the fact that, you not only get a placement ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd), but also you get scored on your driving ability (Star(s), A, B, C, etc...). This gives the game a new dimension not previously available with the other Mario Kart Racing games. In addition, the learning curve is minimal and with a few games under your belt you will be back up to form. I am looking forward to the Game Cube version... Happy Racing..."
4,Pretty darn good,This is a pretty good game. I was really impressed with how many tracks there are. After you think you beet it you find more tracks that you can play and race on. All of the graphics for these tracks are excellent with lush and beautiful backgrounds. It is also very fun to make ghost data and try to be it again and again to get better. After I played and played for awhile it did get a little boring. Overall I liked this game quite a bit.
4,An Excellent Game Over All!!,"4 months ago when I got Mario Kart Super Circuit I could not help to notice the excellent graphics. The karts, tracks and backgrounds are detailed very very well. The sounds and songs are excellent too. The menu layout and overall operation of the game is easy to undersatnd. Mario Kart Super Circuit includes many tracks to race on and 8 characters to do it with. They are Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Bowser. If you can not chose a random option is avaible. The only bad thing about it is that after beating the game it can get a little boring. That is the only reason for the 4 rating. Hope you buy it!"
4,"""Mario Kart"" for the Game Boy Advance","The game is very simple. You choose which mode you want to play, with your options being one-player, multi-player, and something called a ""Ghost Exchange"" that I've never tried but would guess is similar to the ""Pok'emon Crystal Version"" thing where you can press yours and your friend's Game Boys together and each get a gift from each other. In one-player mode, you can choose from the mode where you race the computer, a mode where you race yourself to see how fast you can get your time, and a mode that I believe is the older set-up of ""Mario Kart"" (without the coins and points). Then you choose the level of diffuculty, and pick your character (Mario, Luigi, Peach, and you know the rest.) Afterwards, you battle it out on interesting, colorful tracks, trying to rank high and (except in the timed mode) win a trophy. Like I said, it's simple, but it's also very addicting, and the graphics are fantastic!"
3,"Great Graphics, Poor Play.","The Graphics in this game are amazing, the sound is of excelent quality, but the game itself gets dull pretty quickly.There are no hidden characters, only hidden tracks, and tracks are tracks... run around a few times, different color and shaped obstacles that all have one of the same three effects. They either slow you down, make you spin out, or make you fall.Don't get me wrong, I like the game, but there could have been a lot more to it."
5,Mario Kart Super Circuit,"The people at Nintendo really out-did themselves this time by bringing another one of the games with ""Mario"" in the title to GameBoy Advance. The ones with Mario in the title are generally the best games and Nintendo still hasn't proven me wrong. With more incredible graphics, multi-player capaballities, and the original character Mario, you really can't go wrong if you're Nintendo."
5,Fender Tripod Speaker Stands,"These are the best bang for the buck in a tripod speaker stand. I use them with a Fender Passport 150....they are durable, light weight and very stable."
2,skip it,"My opinion on this book- skip it. You would probably have an easier time learning to play on your own. Amazon has a couple of books that are way better than this one. The pictures aren't that descriptive or helpful. The overall explanation of how to play is not specific or descript. I looked at this book in order to learn to play for the first time, and I was just about as well off as I was before I got the book. In fact, I got frustrated and threw the book away. Maybe the title of the book was a mistake. The content seemed too have been written for a moderate or expert bass player."
2,"Flimsy, cheap...","Although there are not many to choose from for the MXL condenser microphones (which is why i purchased this garbage), this one is really less than sufficient. The first time in use, the microphone stand was bumped and the shockmount hit the carpet. It was no longer usable so i had to purchase a hair tie to rewrap the clips. Crap."
2,These are hit and miss,"I have used 4 of these. One is great and operates smoothly. 2 are ok, a little stiff now and then, and one you have to really push on. THen once it goes you sometimes hurt yourself on the metal. I am in the process of switching from Monfrotto tripods to Gitzo with Stroboframe QRs. The Stroboframe system is excellent and low profile. This RC4 system is part of most monfrotto upper-end heads and I actually have gone to Stroboframe QRs on the built in Monfrotto QRs. Redundant and silly but worth it."
2,misleading description,"I was disappointed in this sugar since I wanted larger pieces and the description left out the word, ""fine"". It was printed on the label, so it could have been included in the write-up. I had no idea that sanding sugar came in sized granules, so I couldn't use it for the dutch cookies I wanted to bake. Needless to say, I now have a product that I don't need or want, and I am hesitant to try to order more on line."
5,Excellent,"This book is very objective, taking consideration of other peoples views, and disects near death experiences. It also focuses on various studies conducted on the subject of death. I'd highly recommend it."
5,The Light Beyond,"This is a very good book which I found completely believable, having experienced a experience myself. Recommend to anyone concerned about the thought of dying."
5,great read,an update on Dr Moody's first book Life after Life. It is very articulate and also includes further research. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
3,It only works with PS2 games,I was disappointed to find out that it will not work on the PS2 with the old playstation games.
1,NO WARRANTY AND PRONE TO FAILURE!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the second ASA 5505 I have had die on me. The first one powered on once and then promptly died. I returned it and I purchased the second one from Amazon new and it lasted about 7 months in an air conditioned room with UPS then suddenly will not power on. It is not a simple power supply failure, I tried replacing that. The external power supply quietly beeps when you plug it into the unit. Cisco only provides a 90 day warranty so you either buy support or you WILL be burned. Buyer be warned!!!!!"
4,Gets the job done,We got this to hang on the side of the house for our backyard garden hose. It was simple to hang up and holds a 50 foot hose well. I like the little cubby hole so that I can store garden gloves and other house nozzels.
5,Don't Think About It Just Buy It!,I was looking for something on the front of my house that I would be able to mount to the wall for my hose. There were many choices but finally decided on this product and what a great deal! Relatively easy to install and it looks nice plus you get an extra storage compartment. Would recommend this product! Just a side note it did not come with any type of screws but this did not affect me as I had some laying around.
5,cheap and easy,"bought two -put them a yrd apart on the side of my pumphouse. took two minutes and they work like a charm. holding 100 ft. of hose between the two and room for nozzles and gloves inside. they look great and are an elegant , simple, and inexpensive solution for hose storage off the ground. another winner from amazon!!!"
2,This item doesn't come with screws..,"I was expecting to receive this item, but when I got it, I was disappointed, because it doesn't come with any screws, so I haven't set it up because I couldn't find a right screws to hang it up."
5,Billy the Kid,"One of the movie greats. Quite intriguing and somewhat confusing how the good and bad guys were pretty much indistinguishable. Quick, hassle-free transaction."
5,Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Two-Disc Special Edition),"I have always felt that Sam Peckinpah was one of the most under rated directors of the great American Western, and of other genres as well. (i.e. Straw Dogs). Superbly shot and well acted (except for, maybe, Bob Dylan - Of course he can't sing either, but is always worth watching and listening to, if you can decipher the mumbling)."
1,Not what I ordered,"I purchased this book with the 2009 and 2010 MLA format but when I received it, it was an older version. Do not purchase your books from these people. I know people who've had the same problem. These people are dishonest. Please save your time and money and buy your books from someone else."
5,Chocolate heaven,I have tried one brownie recipe and one cake recipe and I am very happy with the results.She takes the recipe and not only makes it better she makes it healthier!!
5,Chocolate Cake Doctor,"This is a wonderful cookbook. Very easy recipes, with items that are easy to find. Cupcakes taste great. Perfect for get togethers and to take to work for ""treat day"""
2,stupid,"don't buy this one, it's stupid. Play 6 and pretend this one isn't even out. Trust me it's not the best like others say. PLEASE DON'T BUY!!!!!"
1,Nintendo should produce more super smash bros.' and mario karts!,"All Mario Parties are stupid, not just this one! What I don't like about this game is that 90% of it is pure luck. This is okay on regular board games, but not on gamecube ones. I've also never encountered a game that makes me sooo mad (so mad that I considered breaking the disc more than once)! I think this is because there is no way to disperse your anger. For example, if another player hurts you bad, you can't walk up to them and smack them in the face. You have to wait for the too simple minigames. The orbs are cheap; some take you directly to the star. The computer puts the star in front of one player the whole time. The list of cons is endless. I would never reccomend this game. For multiplayer fun on the gamecube, try Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mario kart double dash, or soulcalibur."
4,3 1/2 stars,"good game, fun with friends, short, if your friends dont know the mini games you will always win, the mic games blow (unless you own a gamecube compatible mic), est value about $15."
2,Not what they represent in the picture.,"Just put the rack together and the craftsmanship is good. Shipped quickly. My only issue is that the picture they placed on Amazon shows all the attachments which ARE NOT INCLUDED. My bad for not reading the details, But it is still on them for false representation. Would have given it 5 stars other wise. Over priced with out the attachments."
2,Whay were they thinking?,"The Daredevil movie was good, but this game has little to do with it (other than the picture on the box). Forget the storyline, or the repetitive gameplay, or the boss battles, and even the radar sense...where's the save function on here? There is none! That's right! Instead of being able to save your game, you have to write down the ""passcode"" they give you to get you back to your place in the game. Not since the wonderful days of the SNES have we resulted to such an idiotic method of saving games! And don't tell me the capability isn't there, because they have it in virtually every other GBA game out there. The sound effects are fine, the graphics are pretty good, and the response is ok. If you're just a huge fan of DD, grab a pen and paper to remember your save code and go for it. Not recommended."
2,Should have just stayed with making the movie.,"About the only thing the DD GBA game has going for it is the fact that it doesn't star Ben Afleck (and in a game this bad it's a good thing). The Man Without Fear deserves better than this brain-dead side-scroller that takes players on a listless jaunt throught Hell's Kitchen to beat up people using feeble martial arts and acrobatics. Yawn-inducingly generic level design and lousy graphics might have been forgivable had they implemented this neat little invetion called COLLISION DETECTION that games use today, although using DD's radar sense to detect hidden items and boss weaknesses is kind of cool. Still, see the movie before you play this [game] so you'll get some thrill out of it."
3,Solid but Familiar,"Lori Wick again delivers a solid story with characters we care about. This book was an easy, enjoyable light read, but Lori Wick fans will find it very familiar. The story Sophie's Heart, little Penny is Celia from Bamboo and Lace, only a couple years older - all the characters seem to be someone we've met before - there is nothing original about this book. If you haven't read many of Lori Wick's books you'll probably find it more enjoyable, and if you're a true Wick fan, you'll read it anyway!!"
1,Couldn't finish it.,"This is Lori Wick's worst book to date. The characters seem to be made of cardboard. There's a total lack of plot going on. They just prance around living their happy little lives. They have no flaws, they don't struggle with anything. They all love each other and get along perfectly all the time, even the children. They never get irritated, lose their tempers, struggle with tempation, or do anything that remotely resembles human weakness. The beginning was ok, but once the main hero became a Christian, I just couldn't stomach the perfect perfectness of it all. In addition to this, I think Lori Wick must have a desire to be a preacher. Every single Sunday she wrote out the entire church sermon. The characters would then go on for pages having perfectly sound theological discussions about it. If I wanted to read theology, I would get a theology book. If I wanted to read a nice light Christian romance, I would get something else."
3,A Wisconsin Wick fan,"Lori Wick again delivers a solid story with characters we care about. This book was an enjoyable light read, but if you are a true Wick fan the book seems very familiar. The story is Sophie's Heart, little Penny is Bamboo and Lace's Celia a couple years older - there is nothing new in this book. If you haven't read many of Lori Wick's books I think you'll find it more enjoyable. If you are an avid Wick fan you'll read it any way!!"
1,NOT her best!,I enjoy Lori Wick books but not this one. There was no part of the story that was interesting. And kids cannot be that good!I expected more from a Lori Wick book.
5,A book to love forever,"Harry sold these books at his concerts and actually talked about it in some of his albums. It a treasure! If you have this book NEVER, NEVER give it up. Pass it to your children and teach them Harrys words and ideas."
2,Bilderberg: The True Story Pastor Mike Hoggard,"Montreal, 7 February 2012.I made a mistake when I ordered this DVD.In this DVD Pastor Mike Hoggard makes extensive comments and describes links of activities of theBilderberg group with themes found in the Bible.I was disappointed because I thought the DVD would be a documentary on present and past activities of the secretive Bilderberg group.This DVD was of no interest to me.J.C.Chirgwin"
1,Too short!!!,This is a half way decent bag but an 055X with a head on it will not fit. Why would anyone make such an oversight? Why advertise a bag for a tripod that won't hold the tripod ready to use? I feel that this is poor research and bad planning on the part of the sales dept. I do not like to return items but this time I have no choice and someone besides myself should have to pay the price. I'm sure that probably will not happen but it was worth a shot!
3,"snug fit, must remove head","it is a snug fit bag for the 055x tripod, with no room to leave the head attached. so add screwing on the head to set-up/tear-down time. compact, and not cumbersome. not padded, very light. thin material. do not abuse."
2,Nice bag but way to small...,I bought the bag to fit my tripod and the head but it bearly fit the tripod alone ( Manfrotto 055XPROB tripod )
3,Not their best work,"The Young Dubliners are a darn good little band, but this album is nowhere near as good as ""Rocky Road to Dublin"""
5,Great Summer Thong,"This is a stylish leather thong from Clarks England. I bought it at full price, and thought it was a great value, and now Amazon has it on sale, so it is an even better deal. I selected the ""birch"" color, which is a wonderful neutral color, but the other colors would be wonderful as well. Another plus - no breaking in time - this sandal is super-comfortable!"
2,Doesn't appear to have been edited,"This collection has some fabulous photographs, but the errant, often ungrammatical, and sometimes incomprehensible descriptions accompanying the photos is offputting, to say the least. Also, the introductory page to each chapter has the font aligned in the center, rather than on the lefthand margin. While this may not seem important, in a visual book such as this, it is not only annoying, but plain hard to read! Finally, the font-size occasionally changes in mid-sentence. Unbelievable! This thing looks rushed into print."
2,Ignore the text,"The photos are... well, they are what they are. Photographic technology sucked in the 1860's and we're lucky to have what we do. It seems to me that this volume doesn't contain nearly all of Brady's shots, but maybe I'm just mistaking others' work for his. As for the text and captions, the other reviewers are right about the egregious errors and nonexistent editing. There are statements made which are downright factually wrong. How did this get published in such a state?"
3,Civil war in pictures,"This book is full of pictures. I am a little disapointed with the photographer Brady as to having always or mostly ""planted"" his subjects rather than taken them as he found them. It presents, I think, a false vision of the war. This can not be blamed on the collector of photographs otherwise said as ""editor"". While I found that the brief descriptions of the photograhs sometimes went against other written data and with less, if anything, to back up the information that this was not intended as such a book. If war could ever be seen as for ""pleaure viewing"", this book would be it. Nice front cover and many nice pictures within of groups of people not commonly found together."
2,Disappointed with scratches on watch face,"I read the reviews & saw one complaint regarding scratches on the watch surface, but went ahead & ordered it since others reviews did not say anything about that. However, after a few weeks of wear, this watch did have 2 visible scratches on the surface, similar to the other review. I am quite disappointed about this since I absolutely love everything else about the watch, including the size, band style, black facial surface which is very easy on the eye, its Eco-drive feature, etc. I also own 4 other Citizen Eco-drive watches & love them all, without having any scratch or any other problem ever.Amazon accepted my return, so I appreciate their great customer services. I am going to order a different Citizen Eco-drive watch (also with a black dial but different model) and hope this won't happen again."
5,Great Watch,I love this watch. It keeps perfect time and I do not have to worry about a battery running down.
3,Potential Time Killer,"In my opinion, many of the mental exercises suggested in Brain Builders fit into the absurd category. Yet there is much of interest. I don't know if any of these exercises will actually improve the brain, or reduce the risk of becoming demented, but many people think so. If you have plenty time to spare, this book may be helpful. But as for this 71 year old man, I'm going to exercise my brain by earning money."
5,"Very Helpful, Well Organized, Easy Read","I have a son who has colic. I had spent many hours trying to find some simple answers to my questions about colic until I found Dr. Krautter's book. Wow, what a well organized book which provided answers to all of my questions. I GIVE THIS 5 STARS AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
5,Love this album!,"I first heard an interview with Kate Earl on Sirius Satellite Radio and as soon as I heard her voice I had to have the album! Each song is different from the one before it, but you fall in love with each of them immediately! Her voice is amazing! It's so refreshing to hear something different from the cookie cutter radio song out there! Buy this album, you will NOT be disappointed!"
3,Interesting book,"I did enjoy the book but I found it jumping around quite a bit. I know people say some of the facts you have heard before, but being a history nut some of the content I never heard of. You will find the book entertaining but as I said it does jump around a little to much. Overall based on content I found this book interesting."
1,ugh,"Maybe I am just growing to old for her work, but I severely disagree with the reader from LA. Gail Carson Levine's books appear to me to be growing worse each time she puts them out, with the exception of Dave at Night. I thought Ella Enchanted was the most wonderful book, so I was highly dissapointed by Levine's Princess Tales. The characters may as well be cardboard stick figures, so little we know of them, but their motivation. They're completely one-dimensional! I agree that all good stories' characters must have a motivation, but honestly, could we be just a little subtle here? And the plot--gee, well, I wonder what's going to happen next? There were absolutely no surprises. Honest to god, it was a nightmare. I'm hoping for more as excellent as Ella Enchanted in the future."
5,Piccirilli Brings It!,"This is a delicious taste of Piccirilli-moonshine.He, like so few can, has the ability to take the average Joe and make one hell of a story out of it. Simply one of the best novels out there.He fills the pages with literature that no mere mortal can create--he is a major talent, a storytelling god.--Joseph McGee, author of In the Wake of the Night, Phil's Place and Darkness Won't Rest: Phils Place II"
5,Amazing book!,"This is a life changing book for those that will embrace Christine's ""moving cycle"" method. I highly recommend to all interested in the fields of movement, dance, psychology, counseling, and meditation."
5,Love this stuff - smells like the beach!,"Other reviewers said this smells citrusy, but I think it smells like the beach - in a good way. Very fresh and clean. It will interfere with other scents, so make sure you're wearing something complementary. I use it to eliminate frizz in my hair (use sparingly or it will flatten hair) and as a moisturizer. I especially like it for the skin. It creates a non-sticky sheen that lasts for hours. It is expensive, but using a little gives a great effect, so per-use cost is not as high as you would think. I recommend it!"
3,"Nice mixer, but...","Good mixer, the lowest speed is pretty fast so I find most of the mixing I do is on speeds 1 and 2. Ergonomically pleasing to the hand. A bit hard to rest on the counter top, the small stand area of the mixer takes a few tries to find when putting the mixer down."
1,skyjacker track bar,"This is normally a top notch product, but the kit I received was missing some very critical pieces. Since the directions in the box told me to contact to manufacturer directly if this happens, well when I did it was like pulling teeth to get the parts I needed sent out. Very disappointed with the whole process...especially for the premium price I paid."
5,not a huge reach - but a very helpful bracket,"My 2 uses for the arm thus far have been to bracket a videocam on a railing upstairs above the entertainment below. Very secure mount and far enough away from the railing to be effective; worked perfectly. I also attach it to a table and mount an slr on it. Below it I move pieces of paper in a basic animation operation. Again, perfect for the job. Adequate reach for my purposes. Be aware that it does not amount to a long reach. Check the specs. Folds compactly and rides easily in my gear bag. Semms very well made and is seriously sturdy."
4,Good workout but...,"I used the tape about 4 days a week and I really saw a difference in my body, especially my arms. I only did the toning portion. I felt silly doing the dance portion and I really don't care for the music. Other than that, I recommend this video for toning. I have also tried ""Optimizer"" and ""Strength and Grace"" which are also very good and there is no dancing."
3,Cheese,"The cardio work out on this DVD was very, very cheesy. I finished the cardio portion the first time I watched the DVD but probably won't use the cardio workout again. The routine was just too goofy. For those of you who don't mind doing corny moves, the steps were simple and I still worked up a sweat.The toning workout was great. The combo of moves was awesome. My heart rate was high enough that I won't need to do cardio the day I use the toning portion."
4,Good workout,"Another reviewer said this workout is low impact and too easy.I have to say this is not low impact, there is quite a bit of jumping where both feet are off the floor and that is considered high impact. If you are a beginner to intermediate exerciser, you will definately break a sweat. Minna is low key, friendly and approachable. The weight segment is very effective. The only problem I have with the video is that Minna's cueing is off sometimes and you really have to learn to memorize the moves because she doesn't always cue when there is a change. For that reason, it would be quite challenging for a very beginner but with time you will pick up the moves. As far as workouts go it is fun and challenging. I like doing both the workouts on the same day."
3,Minna uses dancing,"I bought this dvd as an alternative to my yoga one. Minna always incorporates dance into the workout, which if you like to dance you'll like this, but I don't. Since I don't like dancing I feel really dumb doing her routine because every step is a dance with names like the cha cha cha and the mambo shake. I guess the dancing is good for cardio-exercise. I lost all my energy laughing at my sister and myself."
4,Good plate but won't fit my Bogan 503 head.,This is a real good adapter and plate. It's perfect for someone who doesn't have a built in quick release system on their tripod. I wanted to see if it would fit my Bogan 503 head but it's just a little different.RATS!
3,hat size to small,"hat was to small for the 3yr old but not for the one. great present for a train enthusists but should have better range on hat size. if it fit the one intended fore, would have been 5 stars. Small heads only tom"
4,Deck Box,"Smaller than I expected. Very sturdy, weatherproof and attractive. You'll never dissassemble this box again. Took me 20 minutes to put together. Most of that time was spent reading directions and trying to find the right panel. Nothing tricky to put the box together.I'd probably have given this a 5 star if the price had been a bit lower. It's just plastic!"
1,Shipping charge,"Although the Amazon page states that there is a $15.00 shipping charge for the item, the actual shipping and handling charge is around $39. I have contacted Amazon about this, and they take no responsibility for their shipping charge statement."
5,Very weather resistant,We've had one of these deck boxes for a few years now and they are fantastic. I've got cushions and bbq supplies in it and they stay there year-round. From year to year with the snow and rain we get and not a drop of moisture.
4,DECK BOX,"This is my third purchase of a Suncast deck box. Although they are good storage areas outside, improvement is needed by Suncast to better secure the lid on each box. During a rainstorm, the wind (to my pier deck box) easily ripped the lid off the box and sent it into the water. I solved the problem easily by securing the lid with a spare window latch attached with screws."
5,Simple to put together and sturdy enough,"Snapping together without the need for any tools, it took me less than 5 minutes to assemble this. Could probably be done in less than 30 seconds by someone who decided to make a hobby of assembling Suncast deck boxes."
4,Nice box,I use it indoors to store blankets and some pillows . . . keeps the cat hair off the clean stuff!
5,Great item!!!,I own a townhouse and there isn't much room for storage. I have a fireplace and a back deck. One year I stored the firewood on the back deck and for one reason or another it walked away. Last year I bought a truck load of it and stored it at my parents house right around the corner. I would fill the trunk of my car up and store it in the house by the back door. What a mess! I just remodeled my house and I am very picky with what stays inside and wood didn't make it. So instead I bought this item. It has the ability to be locked and to make sure the box doesn't walk off I also secured it to the deck. I am amazed at how much firewood it holds. I am thinking about getting another one for the outdoor toys to free up more room in the closet. This truly is a great buy! I also us it as a chair or table when cooking on the grill. It is constructed great and well worth the money!
5,Great Buy,"This is a terrific storage box. It assembles very easily in about 10 minutes. I have it outside filled with beach towels for my grandchildren when they come in from swimming. Even in torrential Louisiana rain, it is watertight. Just ordered another one."
4,Suncast 99 Gallon Deck Box,Bought this box to store outdoor cushions and other assorted items. It snaps together with ease and has PLENTY of room. Stored cushions for six chairs as well as a chaise lounge and still have room to spare.
1,Quality and Service to be desired,"Received this product and the locking mechanism appeared to be smashed/melted. Considering I just purchased new cushions for patio furniture was looking for good storage box. Where I really don't care about the locking mechanism per se,I do expect a new product to at least look new. Customer service did not give a hard time when I reported the issue, but said it would be 2 weeks before I could get a replacement part. After hauling cushions back and forth from the shed for weeks, decided to call back. They found the issue I reported but could not tell me whether it had been shipped or when it would get here.Still waiting.... Not happy."
2,Is this the same box?,Is this the same storage box?At least 2 reviewers reported a price of $24.The current price is $59.99List price is listed as $75Is this the same storage box?
1,suncast products,"I received this and it was missing the fron panel, si now it sits on my pier waiting for the wind to take it away"
5,good product.,Recieved this item faster than expected. Very easy to put together with no tools and excellent quality. Good buy
5,great storage,"The box is big and sturdy enough to sit on. It was easy to assemble, 5 minutes, no tools. Great price, too!"
3,Not Bad,"Would definitely buy it again if I didn't have to pay the HIGH cost of shipping. When I purchased this item, I thought I had received the Super Saver Shipping rate, but I in fact had to pay almost the entire price of the product again for shipping. It isn't worth what I paid for it including the price of shipping. One of the sides wasn't manufactured completely but it fit (somewhat) and I didn't want to have to pay to ship it back. Good price for the product AS LONG AS you get a good shipping rate (or free shipping is even better)."
3,This is a Curious Book,"While it contains a lot of good information about the development of mathematics and provides worthwhile exercises, the book offers a glimpse at the Marxist orientation of 1930's intellectuals and the hopeful promise of the great socialist system then underway in Russia that would create the ""workers' paradise"". It spends a lot of time on the deveopment of logarithms and mathematical series as tools for working with large numbers and roots. From our current perspective with respect to the final outcome of the Russian experiment and the ease of performing mathematical operations with a simple calculator, the reader can gain a deep appreciation for how quickly things change. With respect to the author's clear acceptance of Marxism as a true believer, it shows how wrong smart people can be."
3,Really mediocre,"This dictionary is intended for people who don't need a dictionary. It is just so poor, half of the words I look up I just don't find them."
1,"Without Stars, she's only one star...","This is the most overrated, monotonous, and down right boring CD I've bought in the past couple years. Miss Millan's zealous attempt to sound like a hillbillie, is overwhelming. The other songs are Mazzy Star b-sides and hardly original. If there was any question as to Miss Millan's contribution to Stars, it's certainly not for the positive. In fact, I would venture to guess the most amazing Stars album is yet to come - the one recorded while Miss Millan is busy in Alabama, seeking more inspiration for her next solo effort. Maybe she should have asked Emily Haines to help out, before releasing such a polished turd."
1,Bad instructions!,The manual is very unclear and confusing. There are numbers in the manual but not on the parts. It took me a long time to figure it out how to put it together. I ended up returning it to the store. Very frustrating experience!
3,Garden Hose reel,"This garden hose holder was sent as expected, there were no assembly instructions included with the hose reel holder so assembly was a little slow. After this was put together it was really good. Everything was as pictured and discription showed."
1,Suncast Hose Reel Cart HRC200,This hose reel is a waste of money. The cart itself is ok but for some ungodly reason they use a cheap plastic elbow connection. Why not add a few dollars to the cost and use a brass connector. The instructions clearly state the need for caution when attaching a hose to this part. I was extremely careful and still could not get the hose attached without stripping the plastic threads. I was shocked to find this was an American made product and not some piece of crap from China. Needless to say I packed it up and returned it to the store where I purchased it. This is an open letter to Suncast. America can do better than this.
4,One of My Favorites from Years Ago,I enjoyed finding this on Kindle and revisiting this story. I enjoyed Robin Carr's early works because they are full of character development as well as the obvious romance. She reminds me of Mary Balogh in that regard and I look forward to finding other old favorites on Kindle as they are added to the e-book library. Other favorites were Chelynne and The Troubadours Romance (that was probably the best of them.)
5,Love it!,Love this bowl -- just what i was looking for -- excellent for mixing those large batches in the kitchen during the holidays or family gatherings
3,Not up to her usual standards.,"Nina Dowling was happy on her island home, despite the missing two years of her life. Then a stranger arrives, bringing flashes of memory and pain. Ryan Flint has pushed his way into Nina's life, forcing her to remember what she can't bear to think about, from their life together to why she ran away.An old plot that was too predictable. Flat characters with only flashes of Napier's usual brilliance. Terribly disappointing contribution from a writer who has always been one of my favorites in the torrid, overbearing male subgenre of romance."
5,Review,I love Criminal Minds. I watch it at work while I'm setting up my pt room. Plan on ordering the whole series.
4,No subtitles - where are the closed captions?,"The show is very good. We still haven't watched the entire season but so far it seems to just pick up where the first season left off. The only disappointment is that despite the product details referring to closed captions, these don't seem to be available."
3,Splat splat,Not impressed with the guard. I still use it but still have to clean a good bit of splatters off of the stove when done. Not worth the amount charged.
2,difficult with gas cook tops,This spatter guard may work well with an electric cooktop. But with gas and the raised double grate it doesn't fully block the grease splash.
5,Works great!,I used the splatter shield to keep the wind off of my dutch oven while cooking outdoors on our camping trip and it worked great using 2 shields around the oven. I also have one at home that I use as a splatter shield and it works great too.
1,Don't waste your money,Handle with kids gloves as it is so flimsy! It rusts so you can only wipe it and it gets disgusting looking from steam only after about 3 uses.
3,Norpro Splatter Screen,This product is not tall or wide enough to prevent splatter if you have a large frying pan. Would have liked to have known the dimensions before purchasing product.
1,Was disappointed,I am 56. I remember my mother's splatter. I did not recieve what I thought would come. I am not happy with my find. It did not fit around any of my pans. (Maybe a small 1 egg frying pan.) It was not sharp like I saw some comments when I bought it. It was not a quality item.
2,Flimsy construction,"This splatter guard is of flimsy construction. It will get dinged and bent out of shape through simple use. Personally, I would recommend the frying pan-cover type of splatter guard."
1,Razor sharp edges,"You might cut yourself if not handle it carefully. I wrapped the panel with foil to prevent any accident. I should have return it, but I was too lazy for a few bucks."
1,DIAPPOINTED,NEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A MINI BRUSH SET BUT I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT MINI.ITS NOT WORTH THE PRICE.
4,Most accurate book on Santeria as practiced in the US,"As a Priest of Santeria and Palo Mayombe, most santeria books I have read are filled with half truths, and even things made up. The Gonzalez Whippler books, which are widely read, are not good at all, and Books on Palo Mayombe are filled with baloney. Canizares, as the only writer/priest I know, has written an entertaining and accurate book about the basics of Santeria, I would definitely recommend and have bought it for several friends who wanted to learn more."
4,Just what I wanted (again),"I had one of these for at least 8 years before it finally wore out from the abuse I gave it. I have 200' of 3/4 inch rubber hose on it that I use to water the yard, garden and flower beds several times a week in the growing season. I thought I was going to have to spend close to $100 for a similar type hose reel that was made of steel because I couldn't find this one anywhere. I was so glad to find it here I bought 2!! These seem to be better made than my original one, especially the side reels, which are much sturdier."
3,Good but,"Replacement for the exact same model that finally disintergrated after about six years of Florida sun, works well but my only complaint is that it barely holds 100'-0"" of hose and is very hard to roll and unroll with that much, would be perfect for 50'-0"""
3,Hmmm...,"I tried really hard to like this book. The cover was cute, Meg Cabot's blog makes her seem so cool and friendly and fun, and I really liked the other two ""New York Journal"" epistolary books. However...Every Boy's Got One is just plain silly. The main character, Jane, is so shallow and selfish that she comes across as, well, shallow and selfish instead of flawed but lovable, which is probably what the author was going for. The hero, Cal, is also selfish and sort of caddish, but not in the charmingly roguish way a good hero should be. He's just...cranky, with none of the redeeming qualities of, say, Radcliffe Emerson from the Amelia Peabody books.Overall this is a fluffy, sort of fun read, and it's over quickly (thank goodness). It's probably good if you like Meg Cabot's other books, or if you just want something to read on a trip to the beach (assuming you're lucky enough to live near a beach). Otherwise, you'll probably want to pick something else."
2,"Shame on you, Meg!","This is a quick, fun read - a good beach book with some very funny moments. But - and it's a big but for me - every time Meg Cabot ventures into Italian, the book is littered with mistakes (at least in the UK edition. I'm assuming the US one is no better). The name of the airport in Rome is consistently referred to as ""Fiumacino"" (it should be Fiumicino) even on a boarding pass which is reproduced in the book. The menus are full of mistakes, she seems to be under the impression that the Italian for ""No"" is ""Non"" ... and so on. Doesn't it show a total lack of respect to her readers that she (and her publishers) couldn't even be bothered to get an Italian speaker to check this? Shame on you, Meg. The idea of reproducing menus and shop signs is fun - but there's a mistake in just about every one. You could have done a lot better."
1,I had such high hopes.....sigh...,"I LOVE Meg Cabot's other books, especially the ones written in the email/journal style format. I was so excited to get this book to read on a long plane ride.UGH! It was all I could do to get through to the end. Although I found the male love interest funny, I really, really, detested the ""heroine"" of the book. The repeated references to her social ignorance and cat love seriously grated on my nerves. The romantic part of the plot was just beyond belief to me. I had promised a friend that I'd loan her the book when I was done, but now I've told her not to bother reading it.I did, however, enjoy the Afterword where Meg gave insights into how she came up with the story based on the paralells to her life and the story of her own elopment. That was truly the best part of the book."
1,Don't Bother,I LOVE LOVE LOVED The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl and was totally pumped for a new Meggin Cabot novel. Every Boy's Got One was flat out awful. I couldn't even bear to finish it. I still love Meggin Cabot but this book was a giant disappointment!
1,Misleading discription.,"DVD's described as Vols. I & II are actually just the first 2 episodes of the T.V. series (at least what I recieved) and hardly worth the over $50.00 they cost. Deliberate deception is in all probability more accurate than ""misleading""."
2,Misleading,"When I purchased Volumes I & II, I thought I would be getting both seasons. I was wrong. Volumes I & II is only four episodes. What a joke! There was no description anywhere that this purchase only included four episodes. Save your $50+ and watch these four episodes on YouTube. I am one very dissapointed customer!"
5,Great product,This product enables a bend of any reasonable angle between microphone extensions or between a mic holder and an extension. Just make sure that the weight of any extension tightens rather than loosens the threaded connections to prevent your valuable mic from swinging down to an unexpected death.
5,X-File YA #11 Howlers,"This is a very good book, based on the episode Howlers, it is a fun readand quick."
5,BUY THIS,"This is Tufte's best book in my opinion, maybe because this was his first book I bought. I use this book weekly. I learned many good lessons from Tufte."
5,Classic,"Tufte points out common general flaws in presentation of data. He then goes on to examine specific conventional ways of displaying information (boxplots, scatter plots, etc.) and proposes improvements to them.This is an approachable and informative book which will, as the title says, get you thinking about effective and clear ways to display data."
4,Very nice book,"Tufte's book is a very fine book on data graphics.Although this book gives a lot of simple advice on how to effectively communicate quantitative information, it is not just a recipe-like book, as it also makes you think about a data graphic as something that is telling a story with numbers.Beware that not all advice given is easily applied using common office suites. This is by no means a problem with the book, it is just that the text is not at all software-oriented. In fact, you may start to see the limitations in the office suites themselves. So, for those who just want some fast rules to use in their favorite software, this book may not be enough, or even the most recommended one. For all other readers, I highly recommend it."
1,Most irritating writing style I've ever encountered...,"There is some good information within the pages, but I found the writing style terribly annoying - I expected better use of language from a doctor. A book that was far more impressive to me was Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon. Her weighty tome discusses the things that I wanted to see in this book. Things like WHY organic foods are better and more nourishing. I'll keep the book because my doctor recommended it, but I wish I'd found Nourishing Traditions first."
5,Round Fruit Labels,I absolutely love these round fruit labels. They make an already pretty canned fruit product look better. I will order these as needed again.
4,Very positive but....,The watch (a Tag Heuer Aquaracer) is exactly what I wanted but I did NOT think I was buying a gray market watch without the normal warranty. I could have bought the watch for even less (and the Amazon price was very good) but I wanted and thought I was getting a non-gray market watch. Either I missed this (very significant fact) in the sales website or it wasn't listed....
3,My Red bowl,Le Creuset 7-1/2 quart bowl was just what I wanted. The size and the color perfect. Sadly it was so poorly packed it arrived in a million pieces. Why aren't packers more careful?
2,Not strong enough,"My hose reel is just about to part company with the frame. Through fairly light use over the past two years, or so, the spokes of the hub section have broken in two. I have a 75 foot hose attached and try not to be too agressive rolling up the hose, but it appears the frame is just too flimsy. This reel was a replacemnt for the previous model I bought in 1993--it lasted about 14 years before the frame broke. The previous model also had rollers that reduced friction while rolling onto the reel. For my installation, the design of this reel is the best (I need a side feed).The good news is that there has been little leakage and I don't store the reel indoors during the winter (just drain the hose at both ends).I'm looking for a more sturdy reel. I just wish this company would go back to their old design and quality."
1,Doesn't hold up for long...,"This item lasted maybe 3 weeks before it started to crack on the base, just above the hub for the hose reel. They say it's good for 100' of hose, but I don't think they are taking into account the wt. of the water in that hose. I really like the design concept, but they need to reinforce it in a few places so it stands up better."
3,practical user,"This is a fairly nice unit for the price. I will see how plastic holds up after one seasons use, There is a design flaw. The hose comes off parallel to the side but the roller below intended to guide the hose back onto the center axle is at right angle to its intended use. This would be a simple redesign to accomplish & make it easy to guide the hose back on to the reelStanley R.Rosenberg. Architect"
1,Piece of junk,"We just bought and installed this today - it leaks like a sieve! We are taking it back to the store - I do not recommend this product at all. I had to give it one star to post the review, but I wouldn't give it 1/2 star."
1,Another plastic wonder,"I wonder how people buy this and think it won't eventually leak.Maybe using a cheap, lightweight 25' hose might be ok, but for any real heavy duty 75 or 100' garden hose, forget it.Besides it's only supported on one end, the other mistake."
3,Good Product...LOUSY Shipping!,"I've used this product before and love it. The only reason I'm giving a 3 is because Amazon ships in original manufacturers box, which is flimsy. My item arrived crushed and the reel was warped (must have been a heavy item). I am returning it and have asked Amazon to please package it better. Let's see how the next one arrives. Again, other than the packaging, this item works fine.The second unit came in manufacturers package again, but this time the shipper must have paid attention as to not lay anything on top of it. It's been several months now and it is performing better than the other reel I have that costs me twice as much. A must have."
1,Wrong,"Well I ordered the Large, or so I thought, but it doesnt really matter, My dog has completly destryed it in just under 5min. For a Kong product, I am disapointed."
2,Squirrel maybe not ?,"When I bought this item it was listed as a Squirrel. My dog had one just like it and loved it. What was shipped to me was not as shown, and my dog will not touch it. It is actually very different than what is shown."
5,Moen faucet puller,This puller is the best around. I have used others but this puller works every time. It can pull out the insert and the plastic cartridge no problem.
1,INACCURATE,"For those of you know are not aware of this, THERE IS NO CURE FOR DIABETES ONCE YOU HAVE IT (short of a pancreas transplant) I can't believe this author would make such a claim. As far as slowing or stopping it, save your money. Information about how to lower your risk is widely available FREE from many sources including the internet. For example, just follow a sensible meal plan like the American Diabetes Association advises and you can lower your risk of getting this disease. But as far as ""curing"" it? Nope. Not true. Talk about false advertising. What a snake oil salesman. Again, I repeat, THERE IS NO CURE."
5,Nice Versatile Little TV,"I purchased this TV new and have been very happy with it. Great picture. I like that I can connect both my cable and my computer to it. It works great as a computer monitor. Speakers are fine, no need for additional computer speakers. I like having all-in-one. I believe I paid $159 5 or 6 years ago; nice TV for the money."
1,DO NOT BUY! HARMFUL FOR YOUR CHILD,"I bought this product for my four year old son in February 2012. It made him manic. He has always been hyperactive and impulsive, but this made him crazy. Some of our worst moments were during the week that I gave him this. I did the lowest dosage recommended. I have since learned that potassium benzoate is an additive/preservative. If you research it you will learn that it should not be used in products for children. I don't know what he reacted to in this product, but it was downright scary. Do yourself a favor and look into the Feingold or Failsafe diet. This is not the answer."
3,above average,Sheets were okay...not as thick as I had received in the past. Seem more grey than white.
1,The most scratchy sheets ever,"Although it's true that these sheets don't wrinkle (they do a little, but not much), they feel AWFUL against bare skin! They are very scratchy and uncomfortable. I would not reccomend buying them."
1,A large hole after only three months,"After only three months we have a large hole that was worn in the threading. It is as if the ""vertical"" row of thread was shreaded. Amazon offered us only 20% of our money back. The sheets are also very large, even bigger than our extra thick mattress. Save your money."
4,almost as good as The Bull Has Risen CD: Their very best,"To really appreciate this band, listen to the two other albums: ""The bull has Risen"" (Absolutely addicting to listen to) and ""African Littany"" (also mesmerizing with its well crafted beats and tunes and vocals) the Juluka new music is world class!!!!!! I just returned from Capetown and a guide recommended these.....of twelve cd's I play only these....over and over and over and over and over and over and over....."
1,Save Your Money,"The object of this game is to get from point A to point B without getting knocked over by another player. That's it. There's nothing creative or educational about this game. And unless kids like getting knocked over and set back, it's not enjoyable either."
4,Good video,"Good quality Video, with some interesting techniques. The Narrator is clear and concise, and the gentleman doing the turning is obviously very good at his craft. the in depth explanations of certain techniques enhance the video alot."
3,"This isn't a bad collection, especially as an introduction","I bought this after recieving the follow-up (Celtic Women of the World II) as a gift. While I did enjoy it, and a few of the songs were fabulous, the second collection far outstrips this one. It is, however, a solid introduction to celtic music and I do recommend it. The only real problem with anthologies is that it can occasionally be difficult to track down some of the more obscure artists who were represented on the CD--I'll simply have to content myself with the selections on this CD."
1,Sharp Model xu15cr,When I copy or receive a fax it comes out with lines through the work and has many smears on the copy.This only happened since I installed this new roll of film. I was not pleased with the film I received from this company. I have used many rolls of film from other companies and this never happened before. Would not buy from this company again.
2,Not as pictured,"I very much like the tightening design and mechanism (the additional star). However, the short extension coming out the bottom of the adjustment joint does not exist. There is a very short threaded receiver only and no extension. For my purposes that 3-4"" tube was very important. I am disappointed. The price to return it isn't worth doing so. I am still in need of a short riser extension."
5,Family,"First I must say that I loved all of Mallette's books, but I read this one in two days! Katrina's jealousy of her sister Celeste not only hurt Celeste in the end it her one of her own children! This is a must read and lets hope there is a sequel!"
5,Sisters ha!!!!!,Could not put this book down. Katrina puts a new meaning to the word hate. I did not think sisters could hate each other so. You would want to keep reading just to find out if Katrina could get any worse. Celeste is a better woman than myself I could not help Katrina after the way she treated her from the begining. Thumbs up for Robert for finally taking a stand against Katrina I thought they would forever me blinded.Run don't walk just get this book
5,By GEORGE!!! Gloria has done it again!!!!!,"After waiting a year to hear your voice. It is a blast of pure enjoyment! You continue to bless us with with your writing and never ending tales of ups and downs and lifes everlasting spins. Continue to give voice to your dreams! You have again made the characters JUMP right off the pages of this book! The old familiar stomping grounds in Brooklyn. I was there! I finished this book in 1 day and did not want it to end. Chile, if i could get my hands on Katrina -- like you said ... I would pluck her eyes out; snap her neck; knock all her teeth out of her mouth in 2 seconds and still have 58 seconds to whip her [back]! LOL!!! Loved it all! Sibling rivalry-- I am the only girl with 4 brothers! I learned to fight fast! Gloria you showed out in this one! May God continue to bless you and your writing!! (...)"
3,WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?,"after waiting 20 years for this album to come out on CD, why do they put a CD out that has little in common with the original album? They leave off ""Burn"" in favor of its marginal b-side ""Barbara Can't Dance""; They omit the one awesome b-side from this era, the song ""Laughing At The Pieces""; They completely omit ""Miracle of the Age""; and what they do include is in a completely different order.I have waited so long, and loved the album so much I bought this CD anyway (it is a great guilty pleasure as mid-80's faux-psychadelic stuff goes.) However, whoever is responsible for butchering this album for this CD has reached a new low in poor re-issue judgement."
4,About Time,"It's about time someone had the good sense to re-issue this near classic album on Cd. Madman (the Doctors own label)deserves extra points for including ""Waterloo"" & ""Burning Love"" (which, along w/ ""More"" were the only good reasons for buying their dissapointing 2nd album on CD.I gave only 4 stars because this release omits ""Miracle of the Age"" & ""Burn"".Both are on the original U.S. l.p. and are, in my opinion, much better songs than the mediocre ""Barbara Can't Dance"" and the just plain awful ""Fried Egg Bad Monday"" which they seem to be left off in favor of. However, I won't complain too much because it's just great to see this wonderful record on CD again and I eagerly await the rumored singles collection for these guys(and gals)."
3,I'm waiting,"I nearly yelped in my seat at work when I saw that this had been released on CD!Maybe it's being too hopeful of me after waiting for over a decade for the CD release of this album, but I'm holding out in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, there might be the very slightest chance that a version with ""Miracle of the Age,"" ""Burn,"" and even ""Laughing at the Pieces"" will be released. I listened to the U.S. version of this album countless times when it came out, from beginning to end. I'll have to stick with my record (water-damaged as it may be) for the time being, though.If this was the U.S version along with the extra track(s), it would definitely be 5 stars from me. As it stands, I have to give it 3, only due to the omitted tracks.sighThen again, maybe I'll just break down and buy it for the sake of having something at all from this fantastic debut."
2,If you leave autside Usa dont buyed here. No access to technical service and warranty in Venez,"Excellent performance of the product, is fast, quiet, comfortable, spacious, included a number bottles and the pump all at once. It has easy maintenance.The only problem that I have was that by buying by Amazon, I had no access to technical service and warranty in Venezuela because here only covers the devices purchased in the country.In my case, only 2 months after use the sterilizer,the system not run properly and I had to buy a new ...The sterilizer Avent is so good that i do not hesitate to buy a new one, I attribute the failure to trip was the product of USA to Venezuela."
5,It's a great product!,"I bought a Avent microwave sterilizer two months ago. It works fine, but we need to take it down to kitchen whenever we sterilize bottles and nipples. After reading customer reviews in this site, we decided to try this iQ24. It's really a great product. My wife loves it. However, there is no significant difference between iQ24 and microwave if you don't care about convenience and organic."
5,Bottle sterilizer,We bought this for our son's family use. His wife said it was posh since it was so totally automatic and easy to use.

1,Beware,This pasta bowl is not a set of 2 as all the other colors are - this makes it very expensive and not worth paying twice as much just to get the yellow color. You can get 2 bowls of all the other colors for the same price as this single bowl. Very misleading as the title says Pasta Bowls - plural. I recommend picking another color.
1,This book - 96% bad!,"You will like this book if you like reading about :How the West is so stupid and rigid in its definitions.How Bart Kosko is enlightened with earth-shattering epiphanies while meditating in lotus position.The same things repeated over and over and over again with no apparent direction.The new panacea that will enable us to live in the world of George Jetson.You will not like reading this book if you like reading about :Which problems are best solved by the use of fuzzy engineering, why, and how to develop solutions, elucidated in a concise manner."
1,No in depth mathematical or practical info on fuzzy logic.,"The book constantly gives examples that the universe is fuzzy without giving details on how fuzzy logic is applied to practical applications. Very philosophical without mathematics, very fuzzy book."
3,Hard to get past Kosko's arrogance,"When FT sticks to rigorous exposition -- of the science, history, and philosophical underpinnings of Fuzzy Logic -- it's a fine book. For all of BK's obvious intelligence (he's a major contributor to the fuzzy science field and a deep thinker on a range of subjects), he is also exceedingly, distractingly, and tiresomely arrogant -- the arrogance of youth, perhaps. I'll be interested to read BK's scientific writings, but am less inclined to read his other popular works. FT has a lot of wheat, but loads and loads of chaff as well."
4,Enlightened me regarding the nature of probability,"As a kid thinking about Probability I was very uneasy, intrigued and befuddled by its nature and was never satisfied by any explanations I could find in any book. In Fuzzy Thinking, Kosko does a magnificent job of explaining away the mystery."
5,Excellent Purchase,"So I've had my phone holster for many months. It had held up very well, is of solid construction with excellent stitching. I wear my phone daily to work, sits had a lot of use. I'd recommend to friends and family the purchase of this product, should they have this need. Two thumbs up!"
2,Confusing,"For the truly serious student of Hindi with a good deal of linguistics knowledge, this book may be useful. For most people, it is bogged down in Sanskrit etymologies and contrived explanations of obscure sentence structures. It is very much a formal grammar, and does not seem to be designed with the casual learner in mind at all. In addition, the printing, especially the Devanagari, is difficult to read. In cases where there are two possibilities for how to write a Devanagari character, they are often both used indiscriminately, furthering the confusion for the learner."
2,"Very Disappointing, far below rated capacity.","I ran about 12 cycles on these, and a refresh & analyze on my maha mh-c9000 charger/analyzer. 1000ma/500ma charge/discharge, and got these results, which are the best i've been able to get:1 - 17812 - 13553 - 15124 - 1575They all are also exhibiting high self-discharge out of the pack, which was dated 06/2007 manufacture date. #2 cell is already exhibiting extremely high self-discharge. After sitting for 3 days, I charged them all back up to top off. 3 took 800-900mah, which is about a 40% discharge based on their capacity above. The 4th, cell #2, took 2120mah. This means the cell was mostly drained, IN 3 DAYS!"
2,I'd keep looking,I bought this book because I'm new to Vietnamese cooking and I thought it would be a good starter cookbook. It was disappointing to say the least. A lack of instructions does not make it easy for me. I don't like guessing at what I'm supposed to do. There are various things that leave you scratching your head - like one recipe that lists coconut milk and then neglects to tell you what you're supposed to do with it.There are plenty of pictures but even some of them are incorrect.Some recipes will list an ingredient and then show a picture of something different. My Vietnamese friend says that some of the recipes are not even Vietnamese!I did make a few of the recipes that turned out good but I'm looking for something better.
5,"Muy Suave, Fantastico","Si es el Cd de Vuela mas alto, me gusto mucho. Las canciones 1,2,4,9,11 son las que mas me tocaron. Las de mas tabien me encantaron. Muchachos siguan juntos y que Dios los bendiga. Como vivo en la crusada a Juarez, Chih. lo que se esqucha por aqui son ustedes. BJ"
4,Very Good CD,"I ordered it for an autistic child I work with and he loved the movie, so naturally he loved the CD."
2,90 pages of information in a 250 page package,"Another editorial decision to make a book longer than the subject needs so the book can cost more. Extra 160 pages is uninformed and unqualified speculation about telecommunications and copyright laws, and feeble attempts at humor. Why do people who aren't funny in real life think they are funny in print?Every second or third sentence refers to ""your ipod"", as in ""your ipod"" this, and ""your ipod"" that, and ""your ipod"" the other thing. Annoying and weird. Could of used some editing and recasting of sentences."
4,I picked up info and tips from this book,"Although this book was written in 2003 and is more targeted to the beginner, it does offer some things of value:- a review of third-party products available- tips on ensuring good music quality- other tips and tricks you're unlikely to find in Apple's documentationAfter spending several hundred dollars on your iPod, I think it's reasonable to spend 3% or 4% of the purchase price to ensure that you're using it optimally.I don't regret buying this book."
5,right up there with 'the damned',"Bertolucci's 1970 film, finally released on dvd, is such a revelation.. I wish the bush administration would be forced to see this as it depicts a similar mindset to many conservatives of our day..As bertolucci says in the special features, it is about a man who knows he is different so he tries to conform himself to the norms of the day.. Isn't that a poignant topic for a film..the film evokes Visconti's 'the damned' while delving into areas as diverse and interesting as Fassbinder.. This is without a doubt one of my new personal favorites."
2,conformist-new print,"The cinematographer John Bailey (American Gigolo, The Big Chill and as good as it gets) was speaking at the LA film school in 2003 and showed clips from the Conformist.I immediately asked him about it. He said that there's a new print at Paramount made by Vitterio Storaro. I have written Paramount and Criterion. Please harass Paramount about it.It's a shame that such a classic and influential has been ignored for so long."
4,"4 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the transfer","The subtitles are huge, yellow, and intrusive. My Panasonic DVD player can lower the subtitles to the bottom of the screen and fade them, but they're still intrusive. So, if your DVD player can't do that, you're going to be really annoyed. The film is justly famous, beautiful in style (especially if your stomach allows you to view the murder in the forest as a beautiful scene), but very negative. Trintignant kills his favorite professor and the woman he loves because of something that happened to him long ago. At the end of the movie he learns that the bad thing didn't happen after all and he killed the professor and the woman for no reason. I have trouble with Trintignant's moronic wife, but you might not. Definitely worth seeing."
3,Brand name/generic quality,"Bits are NOT hardened steel, they'll be stripped before you know it, (mine were)Second complaint, they give you this useless square bit instead of 2 Philips/slotted."
2,Crop of the Cream,"There might have been one stand-out track on this two disc set. I'm a big fan of the genre and some of these artists. However, the music on this disc is totally subpar. Acoustic Cafe, American Folk, and Americana are all much more successful attempts at this genre by Putumayo."
2,Haunted Houses?,I was disappointed. I thought this movie was something different than what this was. If you want to know the history or documentary of these events than this is for you. I like more of the scary things on the line as Hauntings. None of that stuff in here.
3,haunted houses,This was ok. I thought it would be more documentary style instead of acting out each segment. I give it 3.
5,My picky eater,"My daughter loves the meals I prepare using the book, we where getting in a rut on what to feed her especially for lunch's. She love the verity"
2,NOT WHAT I HOPED FOR,"I bought this book hoping to find new and exciting meals and snacks for children.Unfortunately i was very disappointed as most of the recipes are what i call ""common sense"" and things that i already do make for the my children. I did however enjoy reading what the kids in the book had to say about the recipes."
2,Not what I expected,"Breakfast recipes were mostly muffins. Lunch and Dinner recipes were OK, I wanted more ideas and recipes. Book just didn't meet my expectations."
5,Its a WAHL... enough said.,"Its the best in its class. Compared to other trimmers you can tell the difference when you hold a WAHL and turn it on. Yes it is heavier but a lot more sturdier, reliable and you can feel the motor producing more rpm's.Produces a great cut. If you are looking for a hair trimmer, you must get this one. Its worth every penny."
4,GOOD,"HAVENT TRIED IT YET EXCEPT ON ARM HAIR. CUTS CLOSE AND PERFECT. NEGATIVE = BULKY, STIFF CORD AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. IN THE HANDS OF AN EXPERIENCED BARBER IT IS PROBABLY FINE. I'M GOING TO USE IT TO REPLACE MY WAHL BATTERY POWERED TRIMMER WHO'S CUTTING EDGES HAVE GONE DULL TO TRIM MY MUSTASH AND EYEBROWS. A PRETTY GOOD PRODUCT ALL IN ALL."
1,I hate these clippers!!! Buy at your own risk!!!,"Well, I wish I could add an audio file so you can hear how horribly loud these things are. They vibrate so much you could probably get a decent massage out of them if you could stand the noise. It comes with an adjustment screw, but no matter what you do, they are unbearably, abnoxiously loud! The seem to cut OK, except my wife has to squeeze the sap out of them when cutting to try and dampen the vibrations. The one nice thing is the extra small plastic spacer it comes with which helps fade military hair cuts better. Maybe I got one of the bad ones, but I will never buy Wahl again (or at least I will definately keep my receipt so I can return them as soon as I re-prove to myself that they suck.) I recommend you shop for something cordless, that claims it is ""extra"" quiet, and most importantly NOT Wahl. These are horrible clippers."
2,NOISY!,"These are THE loudest clippers I've ever heard. They're so loud, that whoever you're trimming has to wear ear plugs to keep from damaging ear drums! My dog is deathly afraid of these as well. Wish the item discription mentioned the level of noise."
2,Poor quality,"I had an Oster set for about 15 years before they called it quits, and I replaced them with this set. Waste of money. We are trashing them after 6 months. They do not cut well, and I have to go over my poor husband's head about 10 times to get it all cut evenly. Takes forever. I would not recommend this set."
1,Clippers,"I suppose the clippers would of worked well if they mentioned that it is a 110VAC clipper and not a 220VDC clipper. I also assumed that they would of known that in South Africa, as per Europe, uses 220VDC and that a special adapter had to be purchased for half of the price of which I paid for the unit. My clippers also made a loud noise when operating and would not go away even after trying to calibrate the tension spring. The shipping cost to get the unit shipped back was double to what I paid for the unit, and I wasn't prepared to take a chance on getting my money back. I reduced the vibration and noise by placing a washer between the tension spring and magnet...but in the end, I was not happy with my purchase!"
1,Wahl 79300-1001,This cutter is unusable as it is so noisy that I would have to wear earplugs to use it. On enquiring about how much it would be to return the item at an Australian post office I was advised it would be approx $40. Would this be refunded if I returned the faulty item ?Bernie
3,Good Christmas Movie,"Good Family movie at Christmas time. Would not watch it any other time. Kind of stupid, but kids think it is super funny."
3,so so,"Arrived promptly. Actual quality was fair rather than good as advertised. Packaging was inadequate--simply a plastic wrapper around a hardcover book, so corners were dented and book cover was torn."
4,Great guide with one flaw,"I had this book recommended to me by a friend years ago when we were all trying to get into the comic book industry. I bought it and loved it. You can learn anything you want to know about how the musculature and skeleton are put together and how they work. Each different part of the anatomy is given almost too much attention. Each angle is given a photo of the body part, and drawings of the arm with muscles or just the skeleton.The biggest problem is there isn't too much tying the parts together. You may get a very good idea how the arm works, where the muscles put to and from, how the skeleton moves when you move your arm, but you won't get much information on how the arm connects and moves with the rest of the body. Your aren't a collection of individual parts (2 arms, 2 legs, etc) but one unified body and all your parts move together. You need a good concept of that before this book will be used to its utmost."
5,Delicious,I have a Spiruteen Shake almost every morning. This Holiday Edition of eggnog is the best!
5,Cheese saves the day,"Cheese has been something of a passion of mine for the last few decades and this incredible guide was recommended by my friend Antony, who is a professional cheese-cutter.I has all the favourites here Stilton, Chedder, Parmigiano, etc. and quite a few that i have never heard before, like the goat's cheese Fern Britten, and yak's milk variety Jamieolivertwat derived from Mongolia. It makes one hungry just seeing the descriptions and yearn for a scratch and sniff version! enjoy!!"
4,Love Holic Review,The story line was very good but the male lead actor was stiff. The femalelead actress and the supporting actors held the show together. Knag Ta wasn't bad but he was not up to the quality of the other actors.
1,Terrible,"My stock 2003 Honda Civic speakers sounded better than these! I spent a lot of time installing these only to find that the tweeters were very loud and ""tinny"" sounding. I tried to adjust it out with the eq (I have a nice Alpine head unit), but these speakers are just terrible. Its worth the extra money to pass on these and go with a decent pair of speakers. If it seems like the price is cheap, its because you will get what you pay for in this case."
2,low quality,I know I shouldn't expect a lot since it is Pyle but mine blew in a month on 150 watts max. They don't sound bad but don't try to push them or you'll be replacing them. This time I'm spending the extra money and going with a quality brand.
2,You get what you pay for...very true.,"The speakers are loud, produce a decent sound but the build quality is very poor. I owned a $100 pair of Infinity 6x5 and currently own a set of polk audio 6x5 which were also $100 and the build qaulity is sooo much better. Just by picking them up in each hand can you tell the difference. For a quick very basic set up and small budget im sure these will do fine, what the long term of these speakers are remain to be seen. I personally did not like them and returned just on the buid quality alone. Essentially for the price your in the ball park - spend a little more get a little more, I guess its basic principle."
2,"Value priced, poor quality.","I purchased these as a cheap upgrade for my stock speakers. I installed them and they installed pretty easy, however one of the crossovers was bad right out of the box. I emailed the company and after 2 weeks have had no response. If I call the 800 number in the book, it is busy. I ended up having to bypass the crossover to make the speakers work at all. The sound quality of these is marginally better than the stock speakers of my Saturn. Knowing this I would not have purchased these again, even for the $35/set I paid."
2,Wow.,I bought these speakers thinking they were decent but the tweeters blew in the first day. The mid basses both blew as well. They are trash.
5,Great Sounding set!,These are really awesome sounding speakers.I built folded horn cabinets for mine.Can not complain about the sound orthe fantastic price.
4,speaker,"i like them they fit great in my car i just wish i would of got all the stuff that come with it , i didnt get cuz the manufactor messed it up"
4,Sweet as he!!,You gotta be out of your mind to spend hundreds on brand name speakers...these sound great & are a fraction of the cost. I put them in my car & haven't put a sub on them yet but they are wonderful. Quit shopping around & just get these. You will love them.
2,Not to good,"Hooked them up to a 360 Punch Amp. Day one Tweeters went out in about 1 hour....Day two the 5.6"" speakers were doing good all day not to bad.Day three the One of the CrossOver melted and smoked out my car. But the Speakers are still working.I am now looking for some better speakers. Like every one says (You Get What You Pay For)"
2,regret this buy,"I did not like this product whatsoever, I am surprised my old infinity 12 yrs old speakers sounded much much better than this set. The bass sucks. I expected much better but u get what u pay for. This set doesn't work for metalcore . For dubstep they might be ok but they aren't loud at all ."
5,Perfect!,I have no complaints at all about this product. Installation was easy if you know how to put a speaker in. The sound is great very loud.
5,"Great, fun African pop music!","I picked this Cd up based on sampling the songs on Amazon.com, and I was not disappointed!! This is one of Putumayo's first collections and its a lot of fun. Its music from 2 different bands in South Africa that have inspirational lyrics( just look at the titles of the songs!) If you are tired of the same old, same old- try a little world music!! This album is pure joy and will make you want to dance. If you are a Caribbean music fan, I believe you will love this!!"
4,Good Pop,"Though it's intended for younger listeners I caught some of the ""Cheetah Girls 2"" movie and I liked what I heard. Sure it's heavily synthasized and slickly marketed (because most music today isn't) but the beats are pretty good and infectious. I would rank ""Strut"" as my #1 favorite track and the main reason I bought this album along with ""Party's Just Begun"" in a close second. I won't be doing the karaoke versions anytime soon but it's nice to crank up this CD in my car. And a relief for parents who want to get cool tunes for their youngings without having to worry about vulgar language or sexually explicit subjects. Well done safe pop. Thanks, Cheetah Girls!"
2,History of Open Water Marathon Swimming,"As a book covering the facts of Marathon Swimming history, it is quite okay. But tye layout is terrible. The book is printed on the worst recycled paper you can think of and the photos are extremely bad. I am disappointed tho have paid to much for such a lousy quality."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THOUGHT I WOULD SAVE SOME MONEY AND BUY THIS FOR MY SON AND NEPHEW. NOONE COULD GET THIS TO WORK PROPERLY. COULD NOT DOWNLOAD THE MUSIC WITHOUT A BIG HASSLE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A NEW DELL WINDOWSXP COMPUTER. NOTHING WAS EASY ABOUT THIS ONE.WELL, MY SON FURIOUS THAT I CHEAPED OUT ON HIS XMAS GIFT, SAVED FOR AN IPOD. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. HE TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUGGED IT IN AND BEGAN LOADING MUSIC. YOU JUST CANNOT COMPARE THE INTERNAL SOFTWARE. SPEND THE XTRA AND GET AN IPOD!"
5,Powerful Tools for Self-Healing,"This book is quickly becoming my daily reference. The information is clear and concise; the therapies are simple, powerful, and safe. After 10 years of having worked with Gemisphere gemstone necklaces and therapy tools, I am amazed by the strength and effectiveness of these new ways that I'm learning to use them through this book. Lay people with a clear intention for self-healing and a bit of guidance from a gemstone healer or a Gemisphere consultant can perform these therapies at home and expect to experience profound results."
4,Well worth getting this book,"Jim Shild's book has a lot of details and photographs which illustrate the details to look for in restoring or to investigate a Challenger/Barracuda for the purposes of buying.Great details in year-by-year options, colors and equipment in the respective models and trim combinations. If you can find this book - get it, definitely a good reference to have."
5,WAHL STYIQUE TRIMMER,"Have used it twice and find effective, quiet, very maneuverable. Price is excellent @ $11.49. Definintely recommend it."
4,"If you want an exotic pet, read this","This book was written in a time when spaying and neutering animals wasn`t popular, and when wildlife laws were nothing but peices of scrap paper. The author raises her wolf pups from Arctic Wild but sadly, only one puppy manages to live without somehow being shot to death, ill or attacked. The author tries to make the dogs and the wolf happy, but she only creates more havoc by rearing dangerous wolf dogs and feral animals that can never be tamed. The end is sad, but none the less not surprising,the wolf`s home fails her as well as her desire to be free from captivity. The message is very clear, people kill wild animals when they think of them as pets. I reccemend this book to those intrested, because it hould change your perception on keeping exotic animals."
2,Not that hot!,"This book promises much more than it delivers. It talks a good game, but ultimately is somewhat shallow, superficial, and empty in terms of specific, applicable exercises or techniques. I'm rather new to the NLP area, but I have to believe that other books on this topic would be much better. The book does, however, seem to cover/survey a lot of the general information and content surrounding NLP, so, in that respect, it has some redeeming value."
3,"Interesting kit, but not very practical","Since I like to collect art supplies, I picked up this set shortly after it was released. If waterbrushes were not becoming so readily available, this set would be a convenient portable sketching kit. In reality, it is rather bulky for sketching on-the-go. It does have a generous amount of mixing palettes space and its 4-half-pan holding brackets are practical for quickly customizing the color choices in the set. The water bottle and holding caps are not so useful, but add some small convenience for those that like to carry this kit in an art bag around as a source of water for refilling waterbrushes and holding small watercolor washes. I have removed the original Cotman pans and replaced them with artist grade watercolors for increased performance. I would avoid this set at MSRP, but it's worth a look once it gets discounted if you like to have several options of watercolor boxes available."
4,Amazing cd!,This cd is fantastic. To hear some of the classic Styx songs with orchestration is wonderful. Big plus you get A Criminal Mind by Mr. Gowan which is an incredible song within itself. Just Be one of the new songs is really moving. Whether Styx fan or just finding Styx this is a good cd to start!
4,"Another good live, effort. Just need new studio release",Another solid live release. Where's the studio release though? I found myself replaying the same new songs over and over again and skipped over the classic songs. Everything All The Time is great. Just Be was good and their live cover of Don't Make Sense were the three songs that really made this for me. Get back to the studio though because I'm done buying the live versions of the same old songs.
2,Tool didnt work,The tool didnt work as indicted. The 4 pins did not line up with the 4 holes in the bearing nut. I did remove 1 of the pinsand forced it with a hammer into the holes and was able to remove the nut. But I damaged the tool and was unable to usethe tool to install the nut. I had a friend who is a machinist make me a tool. I have a 2005 Tacoma Prerunner (6 cylinder)
3,Toy was in original wrapper...,The toy came as it was originally. I was a little disappointed that it was not a bigger version. It was a little expensive for what it is. But that is no fault of the seller. It was shipped promptly.
1,LEGO Knight Bus,"My wife purchased this thinking it was the mini bus, there were no specifications as to it's size so one would think that it is a normal sized 'puzzle'. It is very small and very expensive for what you get. When we purchased this we were not thinking 'collectable' and were very shocked when it came in the mail. i would guess that if you are buying it as a collectible (and i know nothing of its value) then it may be a good purchase."
3,Wahl set,"This is not a professional clipper but for its price is good. The accessories are very cheap, forget about them."
2,Good product....at first....,"I was very happy with the pricepoint of this product, as well I was even more impressed with its performace while hair cutting. Then, by the fouth usage it decided to go all wacko. It would just stop cutting, I tried adjusting it, and it would make lots of noise. Anyway, I had to suffer through the tremendous amount of noise coming from this device, so that I would not have to leave the house with half-cut hair!"
1,DON'T BUY! Doesn't work very well.,"I have been cutting my husband's hair for the last 5 years with an ANCIENT Wahl clipper that was able to get a hair cut done in 5 minutes. They died and I got this clipper as a replacement. Not only does it not cut well, but it takes 4-5 passes to cut the hair, which means that a simple haircut takes me 20 mins now, but it also took alot of fiddling to get the clipper to actually be able to make a pass. Pass on this haircutter. I am ordering an Andis- because that is what I use and trust on my dogs and horse."
3,hair clipper,Compared with a couple other Wahl home hair clippers I've owned this one is heavier. The price is good and I only use it once a month so weight is not a big issue. It did not function without a little adjustment.
1,Terribly weak,"I once thought all hair cutters were the same. Boy was I wrong. This thing pulls on your hair and takes many passes while my other electric hair cutter (Hair Salon brand, though I have misplaced it since moving) required 1-2 passes, maximum. Waste of electricity, time, money, and space."
4,Better than a standard filter!,This filter is better than a standard cheap filter. It's by no means a K&N filter but it is better. And for the price you just can't go wrong. Highly recommended (unless you can afford a K&N)... :)
3,poor design,"Specs say ""accepts a padlock."" The handles have holes for a padlock, however very few padlocks actually fit, I had to find an extra wide lock that still stresses the handle.Other than that this product is great. Setup is a breeze. I use it for a toolshed, the shelves easily handle the weight and have an appropriate amount of space."
3,Fun,"I've read a lot of Danielle Steele's book and they seem pretty much all the same, it's all about rich and glamorous people. by reading the summary you already know the whole story. it gets boring if you read her books on and on. but this was fun."
2,My least favorite of her books so far,"I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't. This book is mediocre at best. I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did. I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim. I doubt I will ever meet a ""Wim"" in real life!). My favorite Danielle Steel novels are ""The Gift"" and ""Safe Harbour"". I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories. If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try!"
4,"You Go, Girl!","I have always enjoyed Danielle Steel's books, but I have to say, this is definitely one of her recent best. I cried buckets during the first part of the book, when her husband left. After that, I was glad to see the heroine pick herself up and make a new life. Obviously, this book strikes a chord with Steel's own life experiences and I think that is what makes it so genuine. I took off one point because I thought the ending was a bit contrived with the adoption of a baby. Still, it is well worth your time and everyone loves a happy ending."
5,one of the best k'nex park rides,"i bought this becuase i heard so many good things about it. and everything i heard was true. i don't know what to say except it is the perfect christmas or birthday gift, and is definitly worht the money i payed. i love k'nex and built a lot so i didn't have a problem putting it together, but would recommend adult help ages 9 and under. it can be pretty complicated for novice k'nex builders. it is really fun to play with after you've built it. i was able to show my family after and they were very impressed by it. it is definitly a mouth dropper!!"
1,Have not received order after a month of waiting..... won't do this again!,Still waiting after ordering a month ago..... won't make this mistake again. My son has been waiting for his birthday present..... very disappointing with the website!!!!!
3,K'nex Roller Coaster - good and bad,"Parents -what they don't tell you about this particular roller coaster set is that when you are in the middle of building the model, you find out that the motor pack, separate from the battery packs, are sold separately. K'nex designs a very attractive educational model which sells on the market... and then wants the consumer to spend extra money for a key component that should have been included in the kit. There is no marking on the box that an additional motor pack needs to be purchased. This is only mentioned in the instructions inside the packaging.Other than that the k'nex kits are very enjoyable and educational. Just be wary of what is involved."
3,Heavy on the construction,"The one thing you realize from the outset is the importance of the structure. With over a thousand parts to assemble, the wait to run the coaster is about 2-3 hours. The best fun is the accuracy of the way the coaster is attached to the track just like on the real rides. But since the ride is short continued fun with the toy relies on imagination and a little bit of sound effects. Showing it to friends is also fun. If you have money to buy more than one set you can build longer custom designs. This can be risky since the laws of physics especially momentum and friction are nasty to small scale toys. A real high, out of proportion, lift is required to employ that tactic.The better you construct it the better it stays together, obviously."
3,"Things that look good, aren't everything.",The screaming serpent is not as good as you think. My biggist and only complaint is that the motor didin't support the rollercoaster car.
5,"Reviewer: JB from Galena, IL","I was positively enthralled as I began reading the book and found that I just couldn't put it down. These were incredibly difficult times and I marveled at the devotion the contributors had to family and country whether they were on the homefront or fighting the war. I quickly shared this book with my Mom who was loosing her battle with cancer. She told me so many things I would never have known had it not been for reading this book and prompting my interest. I was a young child at the time and never realized how much World War II contributed to the values my parents instilled in me to prepare me for adulthood. We have passed those same values of family, commitment and sacrifice to our children. I enjoy a sense of pride in the future and appreciation of the past as I experience some of those values I now see in my young grandchildren."
5,Best style I ve owned -,"This bikini bottom is the best cut I have ever had for my body (size 10/12). It is very flattering, with the seam at the center to give a becoming dimension not just a flat behind. It does seem to run small so look at the sizing chart. Oh, and the peach color does have a little metallic blue highlights (something I did not notice in the picture), but nothing too gaudy."
5,"Just as good as any, price is right.","I'm 3/4 of the way through the bottle now. It mixes fine for me as I take it with protein and creatine after every workout. Results wise I can't say for sure as it's a little soon.Between the creatine and the glutamine (both are this brand), I'm definitely notice larger than normal weekly strength gains and recovery time between sets, as well as full recovery between my workouts.Whereas I did a cycle of 600g of creatine and then no creatine for 2 weeks, and now 4 weeks of creatine and glutamine I can definitely say the results went from on to off to back on again, just can't say for sure if the glutamine has done much more than the creatine alone."
2,Not the Big Star disk you're probably looking for.,"After Alex Chilton's death, I wanted to hear more of Big Star's work. I'd only heard a few songs, and thought this album would be a great overall look. I'm sad to say I was disappointed. To me this sounds like a roundup of throwaways, b-sides, and live tracks that really don't do Big Star justice. I would recommend looking at Amazon's download list, preview the songs you really like, and either buy the downloads or find the albums that have your favorites on them."
5,why aren't volune 1 &2 released as a double album?,why aren't volune 1 &2 released as a double cd album?they are both great!! JB
5,Miss Spider's Wedding,"This book is pure poetry; a tender love story with rhyming language that flows to the ear like warm honey. It presents softly the mystery of attraction, devotion and pairing between individuals who from outward appearances are totally unsuited for one another. Dramatically illustrated, the romance between aphid and arachnid teaches tolerance for and acceptance of those who are different from ourselves. Its lyrical vocabulary is satisfying to the adult reader as well as little people. In fact, it brings tears to my daughter-in-law's eyes when she reads it to Jack and Mimi."
5,Elegant,"I haven't worn a watch for over 4 years because I short the batteries within 2-4 weeks. I bought this watch 2 months ago at my boyfriend's suggestion and I love it. I wear it everyday with everything. I've received many compliments on this watch and I'm extremely satisfied. The band is delicate looking which is great for me since I have a very small wrist and watches and jewelry can easily look ""chunky"". It's also very sturdy. I recently went skiing and wore the watch everyday."
5,great big band latin music,this album is a superb example of the finest musicians and proof that Larry Elgart still has the touch Waited for another great one since hooked on swing and here it is
2,Very quiet,"I would not buy these again...poor sound level output. Bass should be better (the cones move in and out a huge amount), but it's not. They did arrive very promptly."
3,Package arrived on time.,The game was missing pieces and in a lesser condition than the rating would have indicated. Made me wish I had spent more for a better game.
4,"Great value, looks good","I was mostly attracted to this watch because of the price. The same watch in olive green is selling at J. Crew kids for more than double. As other reviewers said, this watch runs on the smaller men's side, which was fine for me since I'm a woman with small wrists. This fits me comfortably at the second to smallest setting. You can hear the watch ticking when it is within a foot of your ear, but it's not ridiculous and it doesn't keep me up at night when it's laying on the nightstand. Overall, a good buy. I needed a watch to wear to class and this one was stylish enough at a price I couldn't beat. Would be nicer without the 24 hour times and with a date, but you get what you pay for."
1,Not happy,"I picked this watch up after looking for a nice basic daily wear watch.I opened the box and was instantly dissapointed. The watch felt far more cheap than I could have ever expected. Now I realize at this price that we shouldn't expect a whole lot, but this still felt way cheaper than i expected.If I had seen this in a store I wouldn't have even bothered to pick it up. In person it just looks cheap.Can't comment on the sound of the ticking as I already had it packed back up to be returned in about 30seconds."
2,Keep it dry!,"I really liked this watch because it's so simple and unassuming. All I wanted was a watch that can be worn with anything and this one seemed to fit the bill. Whether dressed up or dressed down, the watch went well with any attire.My complaint about this watch is its water resistance, or lack thereof. I washed my hands vigorously (as we all should) and then the face got all foggy. I never wore the watch in the shower, never swam with it on and yet water got into it, that's weak! Sure, the watch still told the time but I had a hard time seeing the hands through the fog inside my watch. Timex has the audacity to label the watch as water resistant and it's even engraved as such on the third line on the back of the watch but that's bogus. I could've loved this watch because it's a functional accessory rather than a pretentious status symbol, but alas...p.s. I noticed another reviewer comment on how loud the watch ticks and s/he is right, it is too loud."
1,not an indeglow,opening the box was a mistake as it tore voiding the return\exchange then to find the watch didn't have the feature i searched for indglo which i needed to use then to find the same watch at sportsmans guide for $10 for two your price was $34.95 marked down to $23.21 for one plain jane watch
1,cheap,"I was very disappointed with the timex camper classic, cheap nylon band very hard to put on, face of watch is small. Would not recommend....."
2,Looks cheaper than it is,I bought this watch a week ago. As soon as I opened the box I was dissapointed.It does keep the time... but the bracelet is the cheapest thing I have personally seen in a watch. It won't last at all. This watch should be no more than $10. Do not pay the asked price for it!
3,It'll do,"This might only apply to the watch I got, but there was a pointed region on the strap that kept poking me so I had to use sandpaper to smooth it out. Also, the description identifies it to be luminous, but it does not seem to work. It is also not the most comfortable watch I have worn so I set it one hole looser than I would otherwise have liked to. Otherwise, this watch is easy to read and it gets the job done. I'll be wearing it for the next while until I decide to invest in another one."
3,fun read,"Having read a few of Haywood Smith's books, I expected it to have some of the same characters. I may have missed a book in the series, but I kept looking for this character and couldn't find her which distracted me from the book. If I hadn't read other books in the series I wouldn't have been so distracted. Again strong and inventive characters who don't let life keep them down."
5,Inspiring Wizard of Words,"In the ancient Earth's Last Days, even the collected remnants of mankind's Forgotten Lore will make a man into a Magician King. My all time favorite fictional work. The chapter entitled Mazirian the Magician was actually my introduction to Master Vance, found in an ancient fantasy anthology. When I finally (desparately) got my hands on The Dying Earth it changed my life and my work forever. A truly awesome read."
3,It would be better if the bit selection was more sensical,"This set comes with bits that I really didn't need or want. Why did I order it? Because from the picture and description you can't tell what it comes with. What I wanted was: A large flat screwdriver bit, a small screwdriver bit, a #2 phillips bit and a #1 phillips bit. There is no small flat screwdriver bit and there's a large phillips/posidrive bit. Torq and Robertson bits are nice, I can maybe use them once every five years! Poorly thought out set. Not magnetic either."
1,Item Returned,The item did not work as described for making an international call. It was easily returned and reimbursement was issued quickly.
3,"works OK, has few bugs","works OK but often you have to manually tell it to switch to USB rather than land line, when you don't have a land line. but other than that it is a useful product to convert your phone to messenger mic+speaker"
1,Doesn't work,"When we first bought this device, everything worked fine for a few weeks. Then the phone stopped ringing and you could no longer dial out with the phone, only from the computer. You could make calls from the computer, but since the phone didn't ring, you couldn't receive calls. Now, about a year later, we can't even dial out. There's no dial tone at all. I haven't been able to fix it, so I will have to throw it out and start over."
1,a waste of time,"This was a waste of time for me because it never worked properly with my phone. I am above average with computers, but could never make this work properly with my Windows XP computer. Technical support was dismal. I am returning it today."
4,Working as Intended,Adapter works as it should I had no problems using it. I Have it hooked up through a laptop and to my phones. Overall I am happy with the product.
1,crashing with Vista,"crashing with Vista and have no solution to fix it so far, it makes all other qualities as a good sound and low cost... wasted money..."
4,smooth easy listening,"When i wrote this, 'Bucket' had 2.5 stars.It is not a 2.5 star album...it is at least a 4.The trio work well, it is a really nice easy listening soul jazz album.NO it is not as good as jimmy smiths 'Prayer Meeting' that he recorded a week later that had mister Turrentine on sax.NO it not as good as back at the Chicken Shack, Home cookin, Blue bash and many other epic Jimmy Smith albums,BUT it is not a 2.5 star album.respect.If you want to hear jimmy smith ripping the bags out of it, don't buy this album.If you want to hear his smooth tones with minimal soloing, stripped right back in a trio setting with guitar and drums, then this is a good one to get.r.i.p"
1,"Stay away, cheaply made","This is a typical (parts made in China), piece of crap. I've had 2 of them and they both leaked like sieves."
1,Dougie has no energy,"I have seen Dougie Maclean several times both at home in the states and in Scotland. The concerts were at their best with the addition of Davie Duncan and Chris Smith on Percussion. The band at that point had more energy than and rythmn than I have seen of late. Dougie seems unable to sing anything other than a ballad, and has an annoying habit of talling his words off at the end . His plastic sensitivity does not hide his obvious narcissistic personality."
1,Not for all vehicles,"It took about two weeks to get the product. I tried to ""slip"" the cover onto the steering wheel of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. It did not fit, at all! My steering wheel match the dimensions as required. I attempted to stretch the material. But that did not work. Be careful. Don't waste the money if you're not sure."
5,Read It Slowly to Get All the Info,"I love this book. I fully concur with the other positive reviews here that praise the beauty, layout, and writing quality. Futher, what I love is that the book informs and intrigues on several levels -- you can read it very slowly and carefully to get a lot of insight from all the maps and legends. Or, you can browse through it very fast, like flipping through a magazine. Whatever your level of intensity, you'll learn something and enjoy the book. As such, it makes an excellent gift for those with a lot of knowledge of Celts or even an elementary school child whose curiosity you'd like to stimulate."
5,A new view of the first ammendment.,"You ever wonder if you are reading every news story or if some of the stories never make it to the paper? Do you ever wonder what you might be missing? Grab a copy of 20 Years of censored news and you'll be in for a surprise.Carl Jensen takes you down the last twenty years with major headlines that were never seen. I was surprised and a little scared to think of what is held back from the public. I was amazed to see what was never told.Proving the old adage ""It's the media that control the people's thinking."" This book certainly should wake you up to the fact that what you see isn't really what you get, because you get very little from the press.I took just over two hours to complete the reading and I am very excited to read Censored 1999, to find out what I missed for the year. Overall this book will make a great gift for just about everyone - well done!"
5,one of the best live albums ever,This is one of my favourite live albums. It really captures the energy and passion of Santana's concert.
3,You get what you pay for,"The speakers are ok. Would work fine if you are using it for ambient sound and don't need high volumes, it is not that powerful.Other then that, the installation is easy and they look great!"
1,Overhead slides critique,"There are now countless aritcles and conversations criticizing PPT. One question, has their ever been any critique or criticism of the old overhead slide presentation?"
2,What's the goal?,"If your goal is to learn about improving your presentation style, with or without powerpoint, then this book is not for you.IF, however, you are interested in reasons and times not to use powerpoint, this might be OK.If you are looking for a rant on why powerpoint is not an effective presentation tool for complex presentations, this most certainly is for you."
5,Great Season Set,"This is one of the best shows ever made. The season two cliff-hanger leaves even those who have seen it before dying to watch the next episode! High quality dvd's, well worth the cost."
5,My favorite Season of Lois and Clark,I love this season. This is when Lois and Clark's relationship starts to blossom. Always fun to watch when I want to relax and feel good.
5,side splitting funny....,"I was recommended this book from a friend of mine. From the moment I opened it, I was hooked!! It's the funniest read I have had in years. Yvonne's life makes me wish I had been more adventurous when I was younger. What I would give to be able to have had half the experiences she's had. What and interesting and fascinating woman. Highly recommended!!!"
5,A Class Act,"I am of the opinion that Joe Lovano and Michael Brecker ( not on this CD ) are the best sax men in jazz today. Two years ago I would have placed Kenny Garrett at the top but in light of the direction he has gone lately I have changed my view. Joe has done an album in a somewhat traditional vein with a big band flavor but stays cutting edge enough to satisfy people who like their jazz progressive. Fans of bop will really get into this. Actually , any jazz fan will like this recording. A killer CD."
3,Museum Piece,"I couldn't disagree more with the official Amazon review. Not only is this a museum piece, it's a museum piece par excellence. Right down to the ""live to analog two-track"" recording. All heads are turned to look back and re-create some fine jazz from the past. And they succeed. It is good jazz. And it's a good museum piece. If you like your jazz in a museum.Compare it to almost anything you can think of in the same traditional jazz vein. (Clark Terry's similar efforts for example -- try ""Having Fun"" which also has Lewis Nash on drums) or a more forward looking example (Steve Swallow's ""Always Pack Your Uniform On Top""). Something vital is missing here, a spark, an edge, some sense of challenge, of looking ahead. Even a sense of enjoying the music. This one will sell millions and we'll all hear it in department stores and on elevators for a long time."
1,50/50 on good blend. Now it's dead.,"I was excited to get a ""one click"" blender.After less than 6 months, it stopped working. I press the on/off button and it does nothing.Also, when it was working, it would sometimes blend in a single cycle and sometimes it would take five minutes of pressing, and shaking the contents to get it to blend evenly and smoothly!I think the ""swirl factor"" is wrong because it's not sucking down the ingredients like my old $20 blender did.Update: When I contacted Oster about it, they sent me a new one right away and it's still working. Also, I think the swirl is a tad better."
1,Don't buy,"My husband gave me this blender for Christmas. The glass part never fit well into the base and I had to hold it down while blending. The other day I made a smoothie and took a sip and realized it was full of small black plastic bits! The ring had broken and was demolished into my drink. So 80 bucks for 4 months use, what a piece of junk."
4,Excellent Blender,I have only had Oster blenders . I am a chef so i use them religiously . This new blender is EXCELLENT . Blends beautifully . Makes great margaritta's . You have the option to use the self timer which makes a great iced drink .
1,Not your old reliable Oster,"I've had two or three reliable Oster blenders in 30+ years, and this one was a piece of junk. I blended a smoothie, and it would not shut off, so I had to pull the plug. When I plugged it back in, it wouldn't turn on.This didn't seem to have the power of a 1,000 watt blender, as noted on the box. I wasn't surprised to see 600 watts marked on the bottom of the blender. Don't they call that false advertising?"
1,Save your box,"After only a month of having this product, the all metal drive snapped in half. In truth the all metal drive is a metal cap with a rubber gasket underneath. We purchased this blender to replace our oster beehive which had the exact thing break after 2 years. This only lasted for 29 days."
5,"Great overall book, review by certified yoga instructor","This is an excellent book that contains a good primer on yoga philosophy, correcting breathing and how to link different asanas together. It is not a comprehensive book on positions, but rather an introduction to important principles. It also explains how to link different positions into a balanced practice. This is very useful for most beginners. It also includes as a bonus the text of Patanjali's Yoga Sutra. At this price, it's a real bargain and quite different from most yoga books you will read."
5,Incredibly Relaxing fun disc,"I can't imagine anything more relaxing than sitting in the sun with a rum drink listening ti this disc with my eyes closed, imagining I was on some Caribbean island beach or veranda overlooking the water. A great collection to listen to in Winter as well to remind you of how much you miss summer!"
4,nice relatively simple digital camera -- poor battery life,"I wanted a simple digital camera that, if it broke, I wouldn't care so much. This is better than I expected. It has only a digital zoom, but I knew that when I bought it. What I couldn;t have known is that the battery life isn't that great -- maybe one hour of time with fresh batteries. Bring more batteries with you wherever you go.One big plus is that Windows XP sees the camera without any additional software needed. You can install the Kodak software if you want, but you dont need to. You can just move pictures back and forth between computer and camera like they are files. This is perfect. If you still use windows98 I doubt the camera will work this easily."
3,"Whatever Happens ""Bahala Na?""","I purchased this camera because it was cheap and good price for a 3.2 MP LCD digital. I still have and use it. I regret not learning how to save photos, all my pixs with ASIN- filipino singer and honeymoon at Boracay got deletd somehow... however it's definetly worth the price and perfect 1st time camera. It also does have a video capture.... although red eye reduction doesn't quite reduce the red just turns it green..."
2,Not the best...,"I got this camera when it was rather new. I am not extremely pleased with it. It is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it.-first of all...it has no lens cover so you HAVE to keep it in a camera bag. Incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined.-It takes for ever to take a picture. You have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken.-It eats up batteries like crazy-It takes forever to turn on-If you have the flash setting on autoflash, the camera will still flash in bright sunlight-The pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home-It has no optical zoom (but the zoom is really the customer's choice."
4,Simple level,"This is a standard 2axis level. It does the job, though the level in your tripod is also do the same thing."
3,A Fun Read,This book is a collection of 9 short stories. Some of them are intresting and a little amusing...but nothing to rave to your friends about. I don't regret reading it but it's diffently not a favorite of mine. I recomend this book to people who like to read but don't have alot of time to do so.
4,Excellent reading,"Though some parts were a little bit sappy, over all, this book was great. I love how Block relates the stories to other things she has written, connecting them, making them exist in the same realm. Of all the short stories, I think ""Girl Goddess #9"" was the most inspiring. The two girls really came to life and you really get an opportunity to sympathise with their ideas and ambitions."
3,cute,"I really enjoyed the first story in this book. About Sweet Pea and Peachy Pie. Cute. The other stories are okay but the first and 'Rave' are worth a read. Sometimes I read the stories and wished for more, but most of the time I wished that FLB wrote with better grammer skills. She loves to start a sentence with And. It gets annoying. If you want to read a better book from FLB try Violet and Claire or Echo."
4,THIS IS A BIG UNLIMETED GAME LIKE GTA BUT IN OLD DAYS,this is a very good do anything u want game. be baad and treat ur evil side or be a good perosn and get a halo or horns. the choice is urs...
5,One of the best adventure/RPGs on the Xbox,"What can I say, this game is fantastic. I know, some people say that the story is too short but if you spend time exploring all the little secrets (demon doors, silver keys/chests, optional quests, hidden puzzles and items, marriage) hidden away in the world of Fable you can easily squeeze 25-30 hours from the game. The price right now is a bargain too. Buy it, you won't regret it!"
3,So far not so good...,"I think this game's a tad overrated. The music is brilliant, a little overdramatic yet appropriate for an epic medieval adventure. The graphics are good although I think they could be enhanced with smoother rendering. The animation is quite poor, the characters' movements are often jolted and unsteady. Above all; the controls are ridiculous! There is way too much toggling between social interaction and combat. There are too many commands which rely on the same controls and you will often find yourself doing something purely by accident which, depending on the situation, could get you into trouble. The menu screens are needlessly complicated and there is often too much to think about during a relatively simple mission. Otherwise, I think this game could've been much better if they had've toned it down a notch."
3,"Short, simple, not well planned","Fable is an amusing game for a little while, but I would have like to see a little more depth. I never really ended up caring about the story.The targeting system is more than annoying. You will be fighting alongside allies, and it will suddenly target your allies when fighting. It always wants to target the unit that is the farthest away and hardest to get to. Very strange.I was also looking for an environment that you can manipulate. Fable does not let you do this. You cannot break most props.This game is way too short.Why all the hype?Fun to play for a little while.Rent it."
1,Lame,"""Over-Hyped"" is not the word I'm thinking of. ""Rip-off"" is more accurate. This game had so much potential, but falls flat in every way. While the new revolution in third-person point-of-view camera work makes you never want to go back to Baldur's Gate, the blatant false advertising that proceeded the release makes a case for Class Action lawsuit. The trailer that is shown on Cinematech has NOTHING to do with the game. There definitely wasn't any consequence for my actions as the makers would have you believe. Good or evil made no difference except you get a halo or horns. Big Whoop. And don't even get me started about the confining story line and the whole two minutes in took to beat the final boss and take the game back to EB.Lame, lame, lame. The makers should be ashamed.Rent it if you must. But resist the urge to snap the disc in half at the end."
3,Too Short and too easy,This game was great but way too short and way to easy.Wish the game was twice as long.Also this is a Light rpg more for casual gamers.
3,"Had potential, but way too short",This game had a bunch of neat options and stuff you could do in the game.Only real problem is that when you were just starting to figure them out. The game was over. The first time I bet the game I had to ask myself where the rest of the game was. I was certainly expecting something that lasted longer than 10 hours considering the hype that was built up around this game.
3,Good game. Not my cup of tea.,"This game is an okay 3-rd person adventure game. I really didn't find it that fun for me, mainly because this is not my type of game. However, my brother loved it who loves RPG adventure type games.All in all, if you like world of warcraft, runscape then you will love this game."
3,Waiting for Elder Scrolls IV...,"In all honesty I was dissapointed in this game. This is a game I've been waiting for a while but it turned out to be mostly hype after all. I mean 4 years for 8 - 15 hours gameplay for an RPG... Plus it is not fully free-form game as I have expected (based on stuff I read about it) - for example movement is very limited - you are pretty much blocked by almost anything that is not flat ground. Compare that to Morrowind for example in which u have full freedom to move around (swim, fly , dive, jump over things, etc...).I have to say that the game is fun to play though. However, I seriosly suggest renting it, not buying (I played it for the first time and finished in a bit over 10 hours while completing a number of side quests, opening bunch of demon doors and acquiring a couple of legendary weapons)."
3,What is on this filter?!,"When I recieved it, there was a lot of dust on it. I took my lens brush to it, and it was like there was some sort of oil on the filter because all I did was create a large smudge that took a lot of work to remove. In fact I had to scrub on the filter so hard to remove the smudge that I slightly scratched the filter. I should not have to work so hard to clean a brand new product. Really annoying. I got it as clean as I could, but am still not happy with how clean it is. Still a few specs and slight clouding on it. The more I type about it, the more frustrated I am getting, so I will stop."
2,Not bad but...,"...far from perfect, at least the copy I got. While it looks transparent to the naked eye, I have experienced ghosting when shooting strong light sources, like the built-in flash in the mirror for example. I never screw my filters very tight, so I can unscrew them easily later and it won't damage my lens' auto focus mechanism - this filter got stuck once on one of my lenses, I had to apply lots of force to unscrew it, something that could have cost me the lens and didn't happen with cheaper filters, so it is not the lens thread. It's been paper weight since this incident. This is my first and last Sigma product I buy."
1,52mm Sigma DG Filter,"This item was in the list of ""People who bought the 55-300mm Nikon lens also bought...There was nowhere on the description of the lens telling me that the 52mm lens was not the proper size for the lens I purchased.The filter size needed was 58mm not 52mm. I hope it will not be difficult to return the 52mm filter and get the 58mm filter needed.Probably my ""bad"" but I ""assumed"" that if folks purchased the filter with the lens that it would fit. Beware!My low rating is no reflection on the quality of the lens just the disappointment that it didn't fit."
5,great!,"New to the world of DSLRs, this was my first experience with a filter. I am impressed with the multi-coating/low reflections. The filter is not flimsy or cheap ""feeling."" It easily screwed onto my Pentax K-x kit lens."
5,Very nice UV filter...,"To protect my newly purchasedNikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom Nikkor Lens, I needed to find an adequate UV filter. This was a great purchase. You can tell that it is solidly built. I thought about buying a cheaper filter, but decided not to skimp and pay $15 more. And it was sure a good choice!When buying a UV filter for your lens, this is the one to get."
3,"Ok, some glare in sunset shots","Arrived on time, product was as described. Protects my new 50mm lens like a champ and the combo is great for indoor shooting. Outdoors, this filter fails to reduce glare and sunspots, which is a disadvantage for landscape, sky, and sunset shots."
2,Sensitive/Inaccurate step count,"I bought three of these for Christmas, and we are all having a difficult time getting them to work correctly. There is a button on the back of the item that allows you to control the sensitivity if the machine is counting too little or too many steps. If you push it too far to the left, it doesn't count enough, and if you push it too far to the right, then it counts a ton of steps. Unfortunately, becuase it is so sensitive and often quite inaccurate, we aren't using them like I hoped we would. Also, the button to ""clear"" the amount of steps is too easy to accidentally knock and clear the data for the day/workout. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,A WONDERFUL STORY!,"This story brought me a clearer understanding of the early lives of my mother and her parents who were migrant workers in Michigan. The small town characteristics of Pearsall reminded me very much of another small Texas town where my parents grew up and where my grandparents live to this day.Mrs. Hart's family experiences were more often than not, very reminiscent of my own. I am glad that she saw fit to share her story with us.When my sister in law recommended this book I knew it would be good. Now that I've read it I have to say that it is great! It made me laugh out loud, get annoyed with her family, smile in agreement, and cry with real empathy and understanding.I'm recommending it to all of my friends and family as a must read!"
5,Barefoot Heart is awesome book!,"This book is a great example of the emerging authors in our country. This type of book is also a great example of how people can learn alot about their families and a bit of history that not many people know about.My mother's book has made our family proud and has helped her and her family to face that difficult time; to see the honor in the endless hours of labor as migrant farm workers. For me, the book is a little bit of my Mother's heart and soul that I can keep next to me every day of my life. My Mom may physically be 1500 miles a way but the way I see it she is actually closer than you imagine; she is just an arms reach away. Read and experience this moving story of a truly wonderful woman and her family."
4,Interesting,I thought that the part i read about Barefoot Heart was GREAT! I didn't read the whole book but i would really enjoy reading it. I would recommend this book to everyone because i thought that the small part sounded very interesting.
4,"Spitfire, Classic Aircraft No.1","For it's age and cheap price, I found this book to be very informative for the subject covered. I enjoyed the vintage pictures for the early Spitfires. The modeling section is dated but shows what can be done with the Airfix 1/24 scale Spitfire. I liked the hard cover. Recommended..."
3,Lasagne baker,Nice but not deep enough. Well made however and could have found another use for it but it was for my son and his wife and was just not big enough for a family of four.
3,super utility,"used two of these to rest my muddy boots on, they where very small for this, and had to be cleaned often. if these where larger they would have been great, being so small they where only ok."
1,Don't bother,"book does not discuss enterprise architecture -- doesn't cover some of the methods, frameworks, and the purpose for EA. Doesn't even give a definition of what EA is. Contains several disjointed chapters with topics that are remotely related to EA but does not even begin to tie together or address the queston ""what is EA?"" You can do better with free online resources."
4,Good introduction,"This is a good introduction to the field of enterprise architecture. It generally doesn't go into technical detail, so anyone should be able to get something out of it. Also, it is to the point and so mercifully short. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the book has six authors and it shows. There is no red thread running through the chapters, even if the chapters themselves are good."
5,Works without being harsh,"I've been using this product for about a year. It works well without the harsh side effect of the prescription brand.All the herbs are beneficial, and it has potassium in it. I don't use it every day. But when I need something, this is what I use.Great product. Shipping is fast. Will order again."
3,Great buy but clips a lot,"I used the mics to djay a prom. It made the difference. I was able to get on the floor and interact with the crowd, something i couldn't do with my wired mic. Worked great and price was just right! edit* The mics worked for a little while but then started noticing more and more feedback and clipping. Very unprofessional."
1,Hummingbird cleaning mop,I used this item one time and it fell apart. So I wasted my money and my time.
2,Not very impressed.,I wasn't very impressed with this. I think I could have found a bottle brush or something else in the store more suitable and sturdier.
5,Really Cleans the Bottle Neck,"Although the pieces of the brush are a foam and thus not as strong as most bottle cleaners, this is the only one I've found that can get around the neck of my hummingbird feeder."
3,Too much of a stretch,"I was a huge Shirley Temple fan when I was little and she was the main reason I bought this movie. I actually think her acting is excellent and she grew up to have a very nice and shapely figure. However, I myself, have never been a fan of the movies in which the plot consists of basically one mistaken belief heaped upon another mistaken belief and so forth. I've seen better movies and I've seen worse movies, that's about all I can say."
2,Wednesday,"Yeah you end up looking like a pilgrim. Everyone said to me Halloween night ""nice pilgrim costume"" No one thought of Wednesday...oh well better luck next year with a better costume...."
4,Great Inspiring Book,"This is a great book for older teenagers who may want inspiration or advice but feel they can't get it from their parents. Very funny but teaches a lesson. Great for a ""Congraluations"" or ""Happy Birthday"" gift. Remember nobody is to young to learn a lesson from the Peanuts! ;-)"
4,Given as Gift,"This shipped quickly, was a competitive price and worked well, not much more to say so I won't say it.."
4,interesting,a good book if you are interested in the history of television and desi arnaz as a businessman. It doesn't get personal so by pass this one if that's what you're main interest is.
4,Patsy Turned Hero,John Payne was perhaps the quintessential patsy turned hero character in this era of film noir. All the other supporting actors merely play off of his character role developing from one of stupefaction to that of determined resolve. I do think that the amnesia angle was a bit overplayed in this era.
3,"Tje John Payne ""Way""!","Nice noir effort with former musical comedy star, John Payne. He always comes thru nicely in his various noir classics. Tight and nicely mounted with much atmosphere and typical noir lighting and shadows. Sunny Tuffs is a nice surprise as a meanie."
4,Understandable Chinese recipes,"This book is helpful both in the recipes given and the illustrations shown. It also has several glossaries and pages of ""how to"" instructions which I found useful."
1,This is extremely unreliable,"It's unit is far from pro quality even when it works. The mica have no squelch or gain control on them, and they work sometimes but other times don't work at all. I basically stuck mine in the corner and won't use it anymore. Sorry I made he purchase"
1,Not Worth It,"This looks like a real bargain, but if the product doesn't do what it's supposed to, it's not worth it. I returned this product after I used it once. I'm a youth pastor, and I bought it for our youth service. The headsets are huge and uncomfortable, fitting strangely (if at all) on your head. And they hardly work - the sound is terrible. The handheld mics sound better, but they cut out every minute or two for about 2-3 seconds at a time (even though I was only 5-10 feet from the receiver). Don't waste your money on this - spend a little more and get something you can use."
3,fair to ?,"I have used pa and sound systems for many years and recently installed this unit in my church...I performs OK, but for the money, I expected more... this is my second unit, I use one for DJ'ng and it could be better, it sometimes cuts in and out and one of the mic's has already failed... it does have a 1 year warrenty on the product but Pyle will need to see all the components to fix it or replace it. The Unit is OK but I would not buy another..."
4,Worth the price,It is what it saids it is. It does perform quite well and thanks for the input on making sure the power suppy is set to 110 not 220.
1,Too good to be true..?,"Yes. On face value a three disk set with 9 movies, including the rarely seen ""Warning from Space"", sounds great and at just a few bucks, a bargain, so on that score this set is worth getting.But, if you're used to the more careful, respectful treatments from Classic Media and Tokyo Shock, then this will come as a disappointed - all the films here are blurry, dubbed, scan and pan, often with lots of scratches, muddy colours and poor sound.The packaging is also a touch misleading, featuring images from ""Gamera The Brave"" and ""Gamera 3"", neither of which are on this disc.The intentions are there but the execution is lacking, but for a few bucks its worth a punt, and younger viewers might find them fun."
1,Wait a Minute!,"Don't buy this for $8.98 when you can buy it AND volume 1 for only a little more:Moon Race: The History of ApolloMoon Race - The History of the Apollo, Volume 2: Houston, We Have a Problem* Apollo 12: Pinpoint for Science (second lunar landing finds a previously launched unmanned probe)* Houston, We Have a Problem (Apollo 13's mission of exploration becomes a struggle for survival)* Apollo 14: Mission to Fra Mauro (lunar landing searches for the oldest rocks ever found)* Apollo 15: In the Mountains of the Moon (lunar exploration extends its reach using the lunar rover)* Apollo 16: Nothing So Hidden (an exploration of the lunar highlands)* On the Shoulders of Giants (Apollo 17, the last and longest lunar landing, brings the first scientist to the moon)* The Mission of Apollo - Soyuz"
3,Better Than I Expected,"Everything the other reviewers have said is true, so there's not too much to add. I will say, however, that I was impressed with the sets and costumes, which were far more sumptuous (albeit tacky) than I had expected. And Loren and Maxwell (what bizarre casting!) are fabulous lip-synchers and throw themselves into their roles with passion and tremendous energy. Unlike the supremely wooden Luciano Della Marra, the ladies look as if they could actually be singing. No, Verdi doesn't quite survive, despite Tebaldi and Company, but one has to believe that the filmmakers had their hearts in the right place, as their respect and affection for the material is palpable in every frame. Given the noble idea of bringing opera to a wider audience, the fact that this ""Aida"" isn't very good is almost beside the point."
2,No Triumphal March for this cast.,"A great addition to anyone's collection of cinema oddities. Sophia Loren in blackface, cheesey sets and unusual choreography for the ballet sequences put this film right up there with such classics as ""Queen of Outer Space"", with Zsa Zsa Gabor. The plot synopsis spoken in English during various parts of the film is somewhat distracting, as are the cuts in the opera score. If your looking for amusement, this may be the Aida for you, but if want a serious production of this opera, you may wish to look elsewhere. There weren't even any elephants in the Triumphal March (that part of the score was hacked too)."

5,Great speakers,I bought them for his birthday. He placed them in his jeep. And they work great. Good sound and very loud. We are very happy with this product.
1,Broke on opening,I needed this tool for work ordered it and when I opened the package the tool broke into 3 parts and could not put them back. I emailed the company and did not get any feedback from them. Not happy as I had to buy local for 3 times the price.
1,don buy it from eastbay,"i order this shoe june 23, its july 26 and they havent sent my order because they dont have it ,they send me wrong shoes at first to see if i like it but it wasnt even a soccer shoe.after i send it back they told me that they send the right shoes long time ago,after 2 weeks i called them again because they emaild me with the shiping confirmaion but the shoe is now here.now they say they dont have it and they keep my money so i can order another shoes!!then i talk to the manager he told me that they have refunded my money, but they didnt even refund my money. my bank says that they havent recieved any money from eastbay, but eastbay say they refunded my money less shiping and handling??!! 2 weeks ago!!!now i have to find my money."
5,Cute show for pre-schoolers!,"Cute show about a group of guppies (kids) learning about the world. Their guide is ""Grouper"" and they seem to have a lot of fun learning and singing songs. I like how they talk about ""What's for lunch"" and ""Let's go outside"" in catchy little tunes. About 22 minutes per episode, great for short rides in the car."
1,Glad I did not buy it!,"With 2 children, 20 months and 7 months this show gives me a nice break to get a hot cup of coffee in. My 7 month old smiles when she hears the music. I wanted to pre order, but totally forgot to. So when I was in Target the other day, I saw it and was so happy, UNTIL I read the box. Two episodes and the movie? Are you kidding me Nickelodeon? Not worth, so I took to my DVR and taped as many as I could find. Very misleading, and I'm glad I didn't waste my money. Hopefully with all the complaints being lodged Nickelodeon will give us the first complete first season. Take the hint Nickelodeon."
5,Bubble Guppies,"Grandchildren love this. 6 year old girl and 3 year old boy watch it all the time. The 7 year old and 10 year old are not interested, they are just to old for it."
5,"great for kids, esp. those who love music!","my son is always asking for Bubble Guppies. And it's entertaining to him and it's educational, that's what matters! and it's cute."
2,"Very Cute Shoes, Very Poor Quality","I love these shoes! They are cute, comfortable, and I get compliments every time I wear them. Unfortunately, the quality is terrible. After the second wearing, the ""patent leather"" began flaking off. The trend has continued and a good bit of the ""patent leather"" has flaked off the sides. I am sad, but I still wear them, they're too cute not to!"
2,Felt like I was sent an 'off' pair,"I had these same shoes a year or two ago, bought as macy's. Only difference was the first pair had a suede toe. Those were so awesome I wanted a second pair now that I had a baby and my feet grew 1/2 size. I thought it was safe to buy these online and was dissappointed to find that the toes of these were not normal - they edge up towards the sky. I thought maybe it would just take breaking them in, but now months later feel I was sent an off pair. They fit fine, just a bit strange with the elf-toe thing. Wouldn't recommend buying these online again. And if they changed the manufacturing with the line, I wouldn't recommend buying them at all."
3,Slim volume,"The photos are nice but this is a slim volume. Those expecting a larger collection should look elsewhere. However, I should mention the person I gave it to really liked it."
4,"does the job, lousy stand, no bag","Shaves and trims well,convenient,although oiling it each time is annoying.There is no bag to put the whole stuff in, and the stand doesn't have matching holes for accessories. It's a ""get your own box"" product, stupid."
2,randy511,"Not nearly as sturdy as I expected. Cannot be used for what I was going to use it for. I was going to use it as a pre-shave before using the bump free electric shave. I still found another use for it, as a nose and ear shaver. Works well as that."
4,Got to love the boys from Stalag 13,"If you love Hogan's Heroes, you will love the whole series. All of them are great, just what you remember from the late 60's and early 70's. Can't get enough."
3,The saga of Kile Katarn continues...,"Dietz surely knows the Star Wars universe and in this novel he does a good job novelising the video game Dark Forces. Unfotunately the ilustrations are not so good as Soldier for the Empire or Jedi KnightThe apearence of Boba Fet, Luke Sky Walker, and Princes Leia in some pages makes the novel more fun."
3,"Good, but could be better","O.K. I only have a couple of qualms with this product, which are that sometimes it takes a long time for it to start up after pressing the on-button, and that there is a sticker on the inside of the lid, which can be seen in the picture, which, when I tried to remove it, even with BOILING WATER, did not relinquish all of the glue and I now have a sticky discolored residue on my lid, rendering it useless as a weighing table for things such as herbs. Other than that it seems to be work functionally, is quite sensitive and precise and has a good heft to it so it does not slide around. DAMN the absolutely retarded stickers which are stuck to the surfaces of so many products. A pox on them all!"
3,looks better than function,I bought this watch for my 12 yr old and the wristband is too big. The links do not come off to adjust it like most quality watches do. It would fit him if I took out 5 links. I am disappointed because he can not wear this watch until he is an adult. don't buy this if your wrist is slender.
1,Timex Train Wreck,Timex should be ashamed of themselves. Here they sell you a watch that literally falls from your wrist because the metal band comes apart.The watch is GREAT...the band sucks.
1,WATCH BAND KEPT BREAKING,Timex used to make great watches and probably still do but I am not so sure as to why they are putting cheap wristbands on the watches. I wore the watch three times for a total time of about 15 minutes. The watch band kept coming apart. The pins that hold the band together kept coming out. I did notice the second time that it was not even the same pin but a pin in a different location. After the third time it broke I decided to send the watch back. I like my watchbands on the looser side so it was not tight on my wrist. The watch itself was good and I really liked the displays and lighting for nighttime. With this experience I will never buy another Timex.
4,Good watch,"In a previous review, I recommended buying another brand and then bought another one of these. My previous watch quit registering the date after about 9 months. Their customer service is terrible. You have to pay postage to get warrantee repair and then they decide if they will fix it or not and then you have to pay postage back. That's almost as much as a new watch. After looking at other brands, I really liked the design of this one far better and bought another one. If this one fails, then I will try another brand."
2,Poor substitute for a great watch,"For years I owned a Timex Alarm Chronograph watch. It was a great timepiece, all stainless steel; it took a lot of hard use and still looked good. When it finally broke down Timex couldn't fix it but only offered to replace it with a watch with fewer features.The only watch Timex offered like it iwith the same features, alarm chronograph, timer etc. was the Atlantis 100. (I wouldn't be surprised if it has the same electronics inside.) However it is not nearly as good a watch. The body is made of plastic with a silver coating which wears off and looks shoddy. The LCD part is set deep into the watch, it is like looking into the bottom of a well, making the numbers hard to read. The clasp on the band has a way of becoming unhooked, just at the wrong times. I don't know why they stopped making the better product; I would buy it at event twice the original price."
3,"Discoloring, scratches, wristband opens too easily","I have had my watch for about 1 year now. I found after one year of use the face is severally scratched, most of the color has come off of the side of the face. The edges connecting the metal wristband to the face are plastic. I broke two other Casio watches because this facing was partially plastic. The wristband very easily opens up with the slightest hit, making it annoying.I bought it for the price and seeming durability with a metal band. I was looking for an all around watch for everyday and sports. It has endured and the wristband has not yet broken off because the wristband opens up with the slightest hit. However, I would have to say I would not recommend this as a sports-watch. If you use outside of sports, I suppose it would last, but the wristband is still annoying."
3,Not so happy,Does not compare to my other timex watch..this product does not have the same quality..it's not as solid feeling and the clasp keeps opening.
1,DOES NOT MAGNIFY,"This is a telescoping mirror, but it DOES NOT MAGNIFY the image. Therefore, its utility is limited.It is not what it claims. Interestingly, the vacuum pack comes with the mirror surface facing in to the cardboard, doubtless to fool the consumer in a store.Perhaps the price is OK for what it is. It seemed too good to be true for what it claimed to be - and it was."
1,This book should be called: The Black Tantric Path of Fools,The religion of sensuality is the religion of enslavement.As long as your essence is trapped in the desire and attachments of the flesh you will never be free.
1,"red hot tantra? not hardly, more like cold oatmeal erotica","I don't know what happened between the author's intentions and the end result but this book has little or nothing to do with tantra, red hot or otherwise. It consists mainly of lame, pedestrian, badly written erotica followed by short chapters explaining why the erotica is/was erotic and how one might incorporate some elements of the fiction into one's real sex life. Fine: if you're the kind of person who has never before thought of reading erotica, but not so fine if you're a reasonably liberal, sexually educated adult who is trying to incorporate real tantric practices in your married sex life. I guess if you've been living in a hyper religious ultra conservative community and your parents never had the ""talk"" with you then just the fact that you're reading about people having SEX might be red hot; but for the rest of us, not so much. I wish I had read this book thoroughly before the 30 day return period had expired."
4,A perfect way to learn about women!,I did really enjoy the book. I have learned so much about women's internal process with this book and such an enjoyable way that I have to recomend the reading of it. Really nice erotic tales! Just grab a good cup of coffee and relax and enjoy the short stories in this book. To bad that they are really short!
4,Amazon Insects,"For a small, easily carried identification book it is a quick resource. Since it is small it has limited information but will serve as a guide to further searches for particular insects especially because it has the biological information in both English and Spanish."
4,Great call to action!,"A great book to follow his Now Discover Your Strengths. Not a lot of substance to it, per se, but that's OK because the message is really about taking action. First taking the action toward self-awareness then finding ways to optimize performance (and enjoyment)through this self-awareness. Very useful tools to assist the reader in this endeavor. Taking action on this kind of stuff is tough and Marcus has made it as easy as it can be: but be warned - even after reading this book it will still be more difficult than you wish!"
1,more of a teen show,Could of been great but the acting was mediocre by the main female lead. The 2nd half of the drama drag like crazy.
5,Timeless! Fun for the whole family!,"I first saw this on hulu and fell in love with it and had to buy it on DVD. I'm in my mid twenties and this movie made me laugh, cry, and jump for joy. I am so inspired by Jandi's character. What a beautiful heart she has! I told my mother about it and she was reluctant to view a teenage show. She was hooked with the first episode and after the end of each episode she'd say, ""Next!"". Hahaha. We watched all of the episodes of volume 1 in two days! This is a classic--one of those films and shows everyone should see in their lifetime. I hope my future kids will watch it and love it as much as I did! Kudos!"
2,Bummer!,"I am very disappointed with this 3 disc set. Out of the nine movies, only 2 were worth watching, Night Of The Living Dead & The Last Man On Earth starring the late great Vincent Price. I rate the other movies DDD. I haven't viewed the Making Of The Night Of The Living Dead yet. It was all I could do to get through the others."
1,Doesn't work,I purchased this with high hopes that it would work. Followed the direction perfectly and it did not work at all. I did not catch a single mosquito in a mosquito infested backyard. I thought just through dumb luck I might catch at least one. Contacted company and they did not want to hear it. They offered to return with a restocking fee and paying for shipping I would be only getting back around 25% of my original payment. Very dissappointed.
1,MEGA FLOP Alpha Indoor and Outdoor Mosquito Control Trap,"I bought the Mega Catch Alpha Indoor and Outdoor Mosquito Control Trap in the hope of making our evenings around the pool and barbecue bearable. So I bought it for $100 and spend $80 on shipping it to Australia. I set it up as per instructions and have been running it non stop for 2 months, 2MONTHS and it has not caught one single lousy mosquito!, it did caught a few harmless moths, but not a single mosquito, I can sit next to it and within seconds I will get bitten. So, do not buy this, it is a ruse, a sham and does absolutely not work. I Only gave it one star because you have to give it a star on order to publish the review."
4,5 piece dinette,"Great price, fast shipping tho there was some damage the company was very quick & friendly to resolve my issue..."
3,Teen age romp,"This movie is light and funny, particularly if you like juvenile themes. The only reason I bought this film was because Steve Railsback is in it. Steve gives his usual solid performance and his role is the only meaningful one, as far as I am concerned. His portrayal of a father who is out of touch with a son who feels alienated from his father is touching and sad. The final confrontation between father and son and their reconciliation before the boy leaves for Viet Nam is the best part of the picture."
2,shorts,"These shorts are pretty tight. I'm an average size girl, and I had to send back the medium and get the large, which was still pretty small. I wouldn't get these if you're over 130 pounds. otherwise, they're neat."
3,It does the job,"Don't misunderstand me on the rating, this is a good quality torque wrench. The problem I experienced is that 0-600 is a huge range and the scale is small. This makes it difficult to make precision torques. I had to estimate when I hit my torque. If you only need a ballpark measurement(+/-10)this will work fine. This is a quality torque wrench that will last a lifetime if taken care of."
4,good to go,toilet is awesome larger than regular Bowl higher as well only issue I see with it is both back screws are in very hard place to get to you must have an angle drill and use number 14 bolt buy new. bolt that come with it are weak but yes I would definitely buy another 1
5,This is the most anointed praise and worship ever.,"Morning Glory is very anointed and it is something that truly helps you to enter into the prescence of the Lord. I ususally listen to this CD in the morning just before I spend time with God. No matter how many times i listen to this CD, the Holy Spirit always uses it to reveal something to me."
3,Plastic Guide - Metal Hole Saws,"This product did a decent job of assisting with the installation of a small number of locks on solid wood doors in my home. The guide is made of plastic and does not really provide a true wiggle-free alignment. Particularly on a 1 3/8 thick door there is probably enough free play to get into trouble if you are not careful aligning the drill.On the plus side, the hole saws provided are of quite good quality.Note that this guide will only work properly on doors that are 1 3/8 or 1 3/4"" thick. Use in odd size doors will result in a mis-centered latch/side bore. The guide does adjust to appropriately locate the cross bore for backsets of either 2 3/8 or 2 3/4 inches. Conclusion: probably of sufficient durability for a homeowner doing a small number of installations; not going to cut it for a contractor."
3,Got the job done,"The jig worked well enough. I don't feel like the 1"" hole was properly centered and I may have been better off to free-hand it. However, the 2-1/8"" hole was well aligned. The price was right, as a 2-1/8"" hole saw alone would have been around 3/5 of the total cost of the kit.As other reviewers have said, the mandrel is near impossible to remove from the 2-1/8"" hole saw. When it was time to drill the 1"" hole in the door jamb I had to purchase a 1"" spade bit. However, I feel this is the correct tool for that job rather than the 1"" hole saw. Anyone looking to use this should plan on buying a 1"" spade up-front."
4,Excellent for the crafter and herb lover!,"I really enjoyed reading this book and am reading it again right now. I loved the recipes and the photos are great. Good reference book for those getting into the field of herbs, whether it be for growing or for crafting."
2,difficult to use...,"The Yoga Mat Bag is nice, but it's very difficult to get a sticky yoga mat down into this bag."
4,A great bag!! Love the colors!,"I really like this bag! The color combo is so pretty, and the embroidery looks great! I am keeping a 1/4"" Hugger Mugger mat in it and an eye bag in the pocket. The fit is a bit tight, but everything's in there. A 1/8"" mat would be a perfect fit!"
4,"Useful, but should have been proofread","Definitely a good review of T-SQL, a good intro to Oracle but not too complete.Definitely worth getting if you already know SQL, especially if you are in a Microsoft shop (although I think they should have included Jet SQL, I bet there are a lot more Access users than Postgre SQL users in this book's target audience).And there are a few typos and factual errors, which would be confusing for a neophyte.That being said it really is a very useful book, but it is not an introduction or a teaching manual, it really is what it says, a desktop quick reference."
3,"Found something missing, what is missing that I don't know about?","I'm studying SQL intensively for work and needed an up-to-date reference, so bought this book, relying on the O'Reilly reputation for good books.As soon as I got it I looked up something I had just used at work for the first time: The WITH clause. (Or statement, I don't know.)It wasn't in the alphabetical list of ""commands"", and didn't show up in the index. The word ""WITH"" does show up in the lists of reserved words in the Appendix.Is it just my bad luck that the very first thing I looked up - no kidding! the first thing! - was missing from this book? This book is large enough to be encyclopedic, and is organized like an encyclopedia, yet - if this thing that I know about is missing, what is missing that I don't know about but would have wanted to learn from this book?"
5,Heart Broken,"Just turned the annoying age of sixty years old. Totally thought that I had seen and felt everything that life could do to me. Didn't believe I could experience another newemotion until tonight.The last two espisodes of ""BallyKiss Angel' - Session 4 -just tore my heart apart with joy and sadness!-absolutely lost and alone-wanting sessions five and six to be released on dvdas soon as possibleThis series is absolutely incredible-life as life is - !"
2,review of Lotus and CHRYSANTHEMUM,"A VERY OUTDATED ABTHOLOGY OF cHINESE AND jAPANESE POETRY, INCLUDING eZRA pOUND'S bad translation of Li Bai's Chang Gan Xing ;n which he actually uses a Japanese transliteration in the last line."
3,I have to disagree,"The problem with this book is that pretty much the same info is available online for free these days. I definitely find it much less obtuse than a Nikon user manual, but was definitely put off by the B&W; pictures in a manual for a camera that has no B&W; photo capability.All that being written; if you can pick it up for a couple of dollars these days its a good book to have and if nothing else you will be able to explain all the neat features of this excellent discontinued camera, that you can probably purchase for less that $500."
3,Good sound system but no RESUME feature.,"We installed it in the corner of our kitchen and noticed the sound is very loud even when we set it low, which is good. I have friends come over and made a comment that their under-counter TV doesn't have such good sound.The only, but BIG, problem we have with it is with DVD playback, when you stop it and power off, the next time you play again, it does not RESUME where you left off."
4,Great set up for the money!,"I've had this seat for 1 week now. Playing Forza 2 is much more fun now than it was with the x360 controller. I agree with the previous poster regarding the rigidity of the steel used. The seat does squeak a bit when I get in and out of it. But, mine isn't that bad. I don't think I'd recommend this seat to anyone weighing more than around 250lbs though. It was easy to assemble with the included tools. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I just saw the VRX racing cockpit. Now that thing is impressive!"
3,flimsy make,"its ok, but not good enough for the money I paid for. It start breaking apart from the welded joints, buy this one of they giving a welding machine free with this. not recommended at all!!! unless you ready to lose your money within couple of months.... get something reliable!"
3,size runs small,"Cute boots, but they run small. Or, rather, the length is fine, but the rubber toe is very flat, so that your toenails get smooshed. Bah!"
4,more challenging than looks,I found the software more challenging than I expected. I have also been studying with another kind of software which has a totally different approach to the study of the electric guitar. At this point I haven't made enough progress to be more thorough in my remarks.
1,Junk - returned,"I bought this tester, having never heard of this brand before, but trusting that it would be okay. I only bought it because the comparable OTC unit was on factory backorder. This Argus unit looked like good quality when I pulled it out of the box, but that is where it ended. When it is connected to a battery, only part of the LCD display works. Only parts of the numbers show up. If I press my finger on the LCD display to make the display work. I have used lots of battery testers before. Stick with Midtronics or OTC. I am going to spend a little more and get one that actually works."
4,Liturgical Retreat,"If the title of this book is a turn-off,don't be fooled. The book is a spiritual treasure and has liitle to do with the liturgical changes - real or falsely promulgated - which supposedly came out of Vatican II. It's quick read with much for meditation."
1,Sniffing a tube of Tester's glue would be more productive.,"This book is not a How-to. The reader gets 5% instruction on how to paint figures, 65% historical background on the figure being featured, and 30% of product plugs. I knew I got the wrong book when I read "" The camouflage pattern depicted is very difficult."" That was it, no how-to, no method, no nothing. Stick to Shepherd Paine and Verlinden."
2,Compiler's comments,"Compiled in 1986, hard cover, about 100 pages with photos. Printed by McNaughton & Gunn of Ann Arbor, MI. Some copies still available from author. Don't know how it got posted on Amazon. (843) 884-5076."
1,cheap glass,"scratched on the second use, feels very cheap. Overall feels very light, I would expect a harder and heavier assembly and glass."
2,"Slow, yet readable!","It's twisted and sick but readable! It's a story about a couple that go out raping and molesting young women. Although it is long and drawn out I thoght it was ok. Nothing Major, just ok!"
1,"Poorly written, severely lacking in information","The author obviously had zero access to any information on this case. There is no explanation of what happened to the girl, just that she was killed and four boys were accused of killing her for Satan.That's it. No background information is given on anyone in the book and the quotes from the dead girl's two best friends are contrived and cliché. We learn nothing about the murdered girl or those accused.Worse is the extremely poor writing of the author who at one point uses the word ""precluded"" instead of ""preceded.""There are literally chunks and chunks of text that are repeated verbatim throughout the book. It's as if it was written before any information about the crime became available. I was left wondering what was the point?"
1,Pretty but not functional.,"The feeder is very hard to fill and the color of the flowers and bottle have faded out after only one summer. If you want to feed hummers, buy something else!!!"
1,bird feeder,I was very unhappy with this bird feeder when i received it. The copper top was different colors and the wood was jagged and splintered.
2,"DVD, Opera, Mozart 'The Magic Flute""",This DVD will only play on my computer CD/DVD/BluRay player and not my DVD player. The disk is zone coded for europe. The seller has offered to make it good with a refund but I am looking into methods to alter my DVD player region code. Seller is also looking for alternate disc that would be usable on an American player. I am keeping the disk but was really disappointed in not being able to watch it on my large screen TV. Seller should have been aware of this problem as this was a German recording and this should not have been a surprise.
3,Romance in a neat little package,"A little too neat. I loved the characters and found this to be a quick, entertaining read. The storyline was interesting but a little too rushed in its execution. I would have liked to see the romance unfold a bit more and would have believed the ending more had it not reached a resolution so quickly. A bit unrealistic, yes. But still an enjoyable book."
1,Too much mush.,"I was very disappointed after reading the great reviews. Several reviews talked about the great development of the characters. I read none of this and breezed through most of the book just to see what Coles big secrets was, although I guessed it right away. If you like page after page of kissing and hugging this is the book for you."
2,Just OK,"This was all right. Im surprised at the high reviews, I thought the book to be a bit simple and unrealistic. The romance between the two main characters never really develops, and I thought Josie to be way to naive. (And what attractive woman who has dated more than one man does not know what the term ""necking"" means? Especially someone who loves to read???) A little boring for me...."
1,megafarce is more like it,"even when i was a kid i though this was the worst movie i ever saw and it still is the worst! not one bit of sense in this mess of a 4 year olds idea of a script.my 5 year old pick this movie out to buy and out of love i got it for him and after he watched it he said and i quote "" that silly movie,can i get something else"" unquote. the actors must cringe every time this one comes on. the transfer of this vhs tape is very poor also, the night scenes are so dark you can't see what is going on ,of corse this may be a blessing in hind sight. a bigger turkey you will never find . don't say you weren't warned!!! i gave it one star because it won't let you give no stars"
4,Excelente precio aunque un poco lenta para un celular,"Funciona perfectamente como almacenamiento fijo dentro de un teléfono móvil NOKIA CDMA 6275, con enorme capacidad para convertirlo en reproductor mp3, almacenamiento portátil de fotos y videos e incluso como flash drive de emergencia, gracias a la capacidades de transferencia infrarrojo, bluetooth y celular del teléfono. Configurando el teléfono para que almacene directamente fotos y videos en la tarjeta, la carga resulta un poco lenta pero evita que el sistema se ""tranque"" por falta de espacio en memoria (aunque ignoro si esta lentitud es en realidad culpa de la tarjeta)."
1,Dispicable account of events in history,"I find that this book only gives the simple facts to a very complicated situation. I feel that the writer should have been more insightful, than breif. If only they had more interesting things to add to the disasters collumb such as curruption and intriging world events it might have cought more attention. If you could right the book again more detailed and on topic you would see that you attian the readers attention."
3,Test review,"The book is mostly all tests, but it did help me study and helped me understand what to expect."
3,Women in Islam,"Although the premise of this book is quite interesting, the semantics of the book are complex. There is more discussion of theology than of the practical implications of Islam on Muslim women living in the West, thus detracting from the overall thesis of the book. That said, there are interesting tidbits that can be gleaned from the overall content, but most readers will find it to be rather monotonous."
1,don't bother,"Don't bother wasting your time or money, even if your prof. recommends them. I NEVER opened them up as the prof. always told us what we needed to know--also these cards are based on characteristics of drug classes, not individual drugs themselves."
2,Not as good as other Euphone,"I got this for pretty cheap. Even so, fans of Euphone probably won't find it very interesting. While I listen to their other albums regularly, I forgot that this one even existed after I listened to it a few times."
4,Relive the early TV days,"Perry Mason is still enthralling. The stories are involving and intriguing. It is good to watch the old classics like Perry Mason in black and white. No gore, no cussing, no gratuitous sexuality, just good story telling, acting and directing. Highly recommended."
5,Perry Mason still rocks.,My wife loves mysteries. I bought her the volume 1 for Christmas and she loved it so much that I bought here volume 2.We will look forward to others being released
2,Very uninteresting; rehash of the basics,"I didn't find anything new here. Just the same old, same old from a 100 different Entrepreneurship 101 books. The Bootstrapper's Guide to Start-up Entrepreneurship is much better. Don't confuse the two."
2,Good scanner but too fragile for use,We purchased a Scan Station 100 for light duty in our office. Maybe 500 scans in 28 months. But the coolant fan bearing's gone bad. Out-of-warranty. Cost to send back to Kodak for repair is $599. I expected more for a $2500 purchase. I can't recommend the scanner. A scanner with fewer bells and whistles but able to withstand normal use would be a better option.
5,"5 stars for most relaxing, mellow music!",I have quite a few albums for relaxing and this is one of my favorites. I often listen to it to fall asleep.
4,Cage for the new listener,"A good collection for those unfamiliar with the wonderful, witty work of John Cage. These early piano pieces from the 1940s could almost be 1990s New Age music; but I don't mean that perjoratively; In fact, Cage wanted the music to create a state of meditation in the listener. As he said, his objective was to ""quiet the mind and make it more receptive to divine influence."" A divine collection..."
3,Jack Fleming continues his search for the one who made him.,"BLOODCIRCLE continues Jack Fleming's search for Maureen, the vampiress who made him, and his long-lost love.PN Elrod has created a thoroughly likable character, who, in spite of his other-worldly powers, comes across as quite human, with all of our strengths and weaknesses. He is not at all like Count Dracula, which is what makes him unique, likeable, and vulnerable. Although a thoroughly good read, I felt Jack was losing his ability to feel human emotions,in very strong contrast to Jonathan Barrett, the other vampire in the story. For this reason alone, I felt it was not as good as the previous two stories in the Vampire Chronicles series."
2,sneaker unusable within three months,My daughter was very happy with the shoes when she first got them. She wore them often but not unusually so. She showed me a couple of weeks ago that the bottom flap of the shoes have worn away and are gapping open. This request for review reminded me that we purchased them in August and it is now early November. I think with normal wear and tear shoes should last a bit longer. I would not purchase these sneakers again.
2,Disappointment,"It certainly was not your typical Horror movie and it certainly wasn't good either. It kept me interested enough to watch the whole thing to try to understand what was going on but it just got worse and worse. Once you get ""it"" at the end, I was left greatly disappointed."
2,I'm so sorry I purchased this,"I purchased this for my husband who usually likes this type of movie, at least from what it was said to be like. This is short and says it all with saying that we just did not like this movie at all. It's shallow, the storyline is thin and in no way did we feel that it lived up to its description of a great surprise ending with a twist. After watching it, basically we said that's it? I don't like to put spoilers in so others who have not seen the movie can decide for themselves."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"This movie sucked so bad it was boring, not scary at all and just plain cheezy and corny I want my $1 back."
5,To all Da Hatterz,"This movie is a mixture of horror and conspiracy theory comedy. All the 139 people who gave it 1 star are too stupid to understand why this movie is interesting and they clearly represent the stupid, lower portion of the amazon population. You're all pathetic. There's a reason why this is a lot of people's favorite movie. Just because you're too stupid to understand it doesn't mean it isn't good. Not to mention this movie happens to be more than good. It's perfect."
2,Amazon instant is terrible,"So far 4 stars for the flic, but 0 stars for Amazon Instant. The movie stalls constantly, such that I have to reload the page and click the resume watching button,... and if I dare to pause the movie, the audio stop sworking, causing me to have to follow the above steps at least twice to be able to watch it again."
3,Silly fun that kept me guessing!,"I'm usually not into scarey movies that may involve gore, but someone told me this one was actually a bid different. They were right! Yes, there's gore....but there's also alot of things that you don't usually find in horror movies. I won't give it away...but halfway into the film, we were still looking at each other, saying, ""What's going on? We can't figure this one out."" Anyway....it was fun and I did like it. The ending was weak....but still....fun. I loved the surprise actress who shows up at the end of the movie. Nice touch. ;-)"
3,Difterent twists,"This was another I thought predictable movie, surprise , it was not. Pretty good action and some pretty good twists. Not the usual"
4,unexpected,I was expecting another hack and slash horror flick but was suprized at the turn of events and suspension of disbelief. Great movie for horror flick watchers.
1,Another cheese Hollywood flick,"I heard this movie was ""suppose"" to be good, I should of trusted my instincts. Just like most Hollywood cheese ball flicks this was one of the worst besides the movie Scream. If your into no-brain non- psychological, predictable bull---t, than this is definaltely for u!"
1,Disappointing,"I've been a big Joss Wheddon fan, admire everything he's done-from Buffy and Firefly to the Avengers. However, this movie is a complete disappointment. Besides a ridiculous premise, gore is piled on for absolutely no reason. Worse, the dialog is throwaway and the plot line, such as it is, is undecided what it wants to be-is this a horror movie, a send-up of horror movies or a homage to them? You won't be able to tell by the time this bloody mess is over and worse, you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time on it. If you want the proper send-up of horror movies try most of the Scream series. If you want decent horror in this vein, try Friday the 13th series or the Halloween series. But this movie is a complete waste of time. I suspect even Joss wishes this had been a better movie than it is."
2,not very good,Just order something else not reccomended at all. Thats really all i have to say. Not scary or creepy at all. nextttttt!
2,Awful,"Campy and over the top. I was hoping for a ""smart"" horror flick with character development. This one was half-way decent until the ridiculous finale."
2,Too many previews,"In all the movie trailers for this movie they showed too much. I like to be surprised by movies, also the plot was way too over the top. Not impressed."
2,not the movie you think its gonna be,"Very cheaply made and over rated movie. Pitiful plot, nothing to what you would think the movie would be about by watching the trailer."
4,GREAT MOVIE,Not what you expect at ALL the ending half hour was the best of the whole movie. Some of the best monsters I have seen in a movie in a long time.
3,Pretty good,I like this movie. It was an interesting twist on an old story. A cross between the matrix and a jason horror film. Thought it would have been a little better from the preview but all and all it was good.
3,"I knew there was a twist, but really??","I knew there was a twist, but really?? I would only rent this movie to fill time. This movie has a great start and then just tapers off. Your left with more questions."
4,If you do not like you jave not got the point,"Yes it cloches if you to not have a open mind. It about today's. America or societies take on horror are we puppeteers are we controlled by mass media. The good or the bad. All horror movies cliches are in this movie. As well as religion cultures and our thinking of ancient and philosophic gods and demon with some pretty good humor thrown in. I will purchase for my collection because we make our. Own destiny depending on if we follow logical thoughts""if you saw the movie you know what I mean. The ending was the stupid part. Really........its a different horror. Movie and It is so many ways to look at that.."
4,Unexpected twists,"A very new way to make a horror movie, twisted! Highly recommended. Deducted one star for being a little cheezy in the very last scene otherwise something you will think about."
1,horror comedy??,"This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen. It was funny than scary, dialog was pretty weak and the story line was just terrible !! This is actually a movie I wanted to see in the theater based on the previews, and I'm sooo glad I didn't my money (or at least less)"
1,It's the Truman Show plus zombies- and is terrible!,What a pointless waste of time. I can't believe I paid to see this POS. Horror movie Truman Show that makes no sense and is pointless.
2,Don't be misguided by other reviews,"Certainly the idea of another layer of horror being added to the archetypal slasher, dumb college students trip to the woods idea should or could be interesting. Instead we have a laughable (intentional or not) waste of your money and time. Poor parody, no real laughs except at myself for renting this tripe. Do not be fooled into thinking you are going to see a clever, multilayer allegory; you ain't going to find it here. Just tired dialogue, stupid behavior all around, and at the end the need to do penance for having wasted valuable minutes of your life. I only wish the red-neck, violence worshiping family would have popped through my door and killed me for having rented this mess (hopefully only minutes into the film thus saving me the embarrassment of believing something actually was going to happen). This thing is an abortion."
1,Worst Movie Ever,Do not waste your time or money on this. It was horrible. I want those two hours of my life back. Very glad I did not pay full price in the theater for this. How did this get an average rating above one star??? I'd give it negative stars if I could.
1,Sucks,"Crappy story line.Not even scary enough for the 13 year old males it targets.A waste of energy, talent, and time."
1,This movie sucks!,"This movie sucks! Horrible FX and at times really annoying characters. This film was praised for it's originality and new take on the horror genre. All I found was a bunch of references to other horror movies and a Merman?! Really? ""But it was so clever in how it explains every other horror movie ever!"" SHOOOOOOSH! This movie wasn't clever or creative in any way with the exception of a really cool bong. The film only succeeds in squashing any hope that a truly original horror movie will ever be released again!"
2,A little too far over the edge,We didn't really care for this movie. It was too much fantasy and too much going on all at once. We didn't find it scary just wierd. There wasn't really any flow to the movie. We were pretty let down with it.
3,Not what I expected,"All in all it was an ok movie. I was expecting a horror type movie so that right there disappointed me. It is a good concept for a movie, a little bit more detail or back story would have made it a little better. I would recommend it but it would not be the first on my list to do so."
4,Overseas Buyers beware,"While this is an amazingly good film, I had to wait until I had purchased a second copy on DVD to be able to view it. This Blu-Ray will NOT PLAY on Pioneer multi-region Blu-ray players. If you own one, don't even bother buying it in this format. Get the DVD format instead."
1,not that good!,"I love horror movies, but this movie just didn't make sense to me. Not a movie I would watch again or recommended to my friends."
2,Bleh,"Big fan of most everything Joss Whedon has done, but this movie was predictable and boring. Where was all the witty dialogue that Joss does so well?"
3,Not the typical horror film...perhaps too non-typical.,"I think the movie went way overboard trying to be ""different."" Certainly, the plot was clever, fresh, but the script tried to drive the plot home in a ""hammer over the head"" kind of way. It was uneccesarily intense and kind of silly. I wasn't scared at all. I was repulsed either. It was just okay."
5,Awesome,"I absolutely loved this movie!!! Joss Whedon is a genius. This film captures that classic horror movie feel, cliches and all, yet manages to be fresh and interesting. It is campy and a little spoofy but really cool and original. Buffy/Angel fans will recognize some familiar concepts while pop culture and horror fans will enjoy all of the little nods to everything from Evil Dead to Hellraiser to Scooby-Doo. This is a surprising gem to find on a late night Redbox run to be sure."
3,A CHAOTIC CABIN,"On the surface, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS appears to be another teens going off on a weekend getting slaughtered one by one. However, there's more to this giddily entertaining film. That difference doesn't always work for me but amidst all the chaos lies an admittedly original horror movie.My biggest complaint is there are many key scenes that are shot in the dark thereby diminishing their effectiveness. The acting overall is above average, especially Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as the enigmatic lab techs. Also the appearance of a noted sci-fi icon adds an unexpected boost.I think the movie has been over-hyped and its climactic conclusion over the top, but CABIN is different enough to elevate it above those movies it is obviously parodying."
5,Worth a watch,"This movie started out feeling just like a cheesy horror flick, but the plot twists made it so much more interesting. Worth watching if you enjoy horror movies."
4,Nice twist,"Funny, thrilling, and suspenseful. Nice twist to the story also. This movie will make you laugh at parts, but keep you on the edge of your seat as well.I would recommend"
4,"If you liked ""Buffy"", you'll appreciate this too.","I'm not going to write much more than to say I enjoyed it, overall. Think of a 90 minute Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, only Buffy isn't around to save the day."
3,Better than Average,"This is a ""mad slasher"" flick to be sure, but with an interesting twist toward the end. It's not my type of film, but it's worth a look if you like the horror genre."
4,Whedon did it again!,Watched it just because I was curious. Not my usual genre. Loved it! New spin on a usually trite story line!
4,Not what I thought.,"I wasn't exactly sure about this movie. Thought it would be just a bunch of psychos stalking a bunch of young people on vacation (which would have just been basic, nothing special), but.......I was wrong! lol"
4,Not A Normal Horror Flick - Recommended,"""The Cabin In The Woods"" is not your average horror movie and you definitely should not read any spoiler reviews before seeing it since there are a lot of twists. I am a horror movie fan and also enjoy most of Joss Whedon's projects (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, etc), so likely was predisposed to enjoy this quirky and fun movie.No spoilers from me: The movie centers on five stereotypical college kids (three guys and two girls) that head off for a weekend of fun at remote ""Cabin In the Woods"". The movie starts as expected, with every possible bad horror film cliche being poked at, but quickly becomes something different. The acting is on par with most modern horror movies and the special effects are actually better than expected, but the real reason to see this movie is enjoy the various clever plot twists and turns.This isn't a great a movie, but it is an enjoyable twist on horror flicks.Recommended!CFH"
3,Good but nor great,I gave this movie three stars out of five because of the ending.Through most of the show it had the veiwer guessing what was really going on and kept you at the edge of your seat.Sadly it had a predictable ending which put a damper on the rest of the movie but it still worth watching at least once.
1,Thumbs Down,horrible movie.. Do not waste any money or time on this one. The story line and the concept was not believable
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time,Hated this movie. Thought it was horrible. I gave it to the Salvation Army because I couldn't stand it in my house any longer
2,"Not that funny, not that scary","After about 30 mins in I was rooting for every single character to die to get this film over with. A few laughs don't make up for the rest of the mess. Nobody to root for, nothing to care about, lame concept, effects/creatures aren't cool enough to hold interest. Only for those who worship at the Joss Whedon alter... sorry, not everything he does it gold, especially this turd.If you want a funny horror movie, I recommend Tucker and Dale vs Evil."
4,Perfect Horror/Sci Fi Film,"I personally loved supernatural horror films such as Nightmare or Hellraiser, and hated slasher horror (aka Friday the 13th, Cabin Fever, Hostel, etc)This was probably the best horror film I have seen in a long time! When it started out as a slasher film I was pissed and ready to turn it off (I can't see why anyone enjoys those.) The only thing that kept me interested was the cuts to the ""control room"" and my hope that Joss and company would deliver since I have enjoyed them since Buffy/Angel days, and.......He did not disappoint! This is a must for people who like to think in films. It was smart, cleaver, had a purpose for killing people, and added the supernatural elements that I love.For all mindless drones bashing it on here who just want to see people get murdered for no other reason than some sick fetish fantasy of yours please go troll somewhere else!"
2,Suspense replaced with gore and profanity,"If you liked this movie, I respect that. It was very original, well made, and had a humorous self-mocking awareness to it. It had some great actors in it. But they took the cheap way out - instead of creating suspense, they just substituted gore. They were obviously going for over-the-top how much blood and disturbing imagery can we throw in? Also be warned that if planning to watch this with young, tasteful, or sensitive folks, the f-word is the most commonly used word in the movie - no less than 100 times. So, while I applaud its originality, it is definitely a movie born of the horror video game era, and not of the masters of suspense that came before. It does not make a good date movie, family movie, or suspense move - it's just a creative, but disturbing, slasher pic. I expected more from Joss."
2,The cabin in the woods,"Sorry I purchased this, thought it would be much better for the price. I actually think it stunk and would not recommend"
5,love this movie!,"I'm a horror movie fanatic, so this movie was a must in my collection. It arrived quickly and safely. I pre-ordered it, which was much more convenient than driving out to a store that may or may not have it.Well-shipped and priced."
2,Not what I expected,"The plot was all over the place, and it is hard to make sense of the movie. When you are finished watching this movie you will feel like you wasted your time."
3,What to expect when you are expecting an horror movie,"It simple, not what they said it was. Even when they make this kind of ehhhh... plot, they could manage better the movie and make it at least terror with a twist keeping the stupid bet and lab for maybe almost the end, but men, WTF... Rent it or wait for it on TV."
1,The Cabin in the Woods is the worst film ever made,"I am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing a rating of 7.9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming qualities. Believe me it doesn't. It is ridiculous and abysmal. The scary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same individual that states scream is original. Some may find this deeply disturbing but I would be quite happy to live in a world without films such as scream, there i said it. There was only one scene that I found funny and it was when Mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force field of some sort. I began thinking something worth while was going to happen but this moment never came."
2,Movie was too Dark,"The movie was viewed via Amazon Prime streaming through my PS3. It was too dark to view, although we did watch the entire movie because my wife had yet to see it. This experience leaves me skeptical of the Amazon Prime video service. I will give it another chance before totally writing it off, but as off now AP is my fourth choice for viewing streaming content."
3,mehhh,"Good production value, etc.and an interesting story concept. But for a movie where the outcome is so unlikely in the heroism demonstrated, I would expect a better cast of characters (the actors were fine, but the writing was not very good or funny).."
3,"Wasn't fun, just long.","I rented this movie because I saw that Joss Whedon had been involved. Love his work. I expected better dialog and people I could root for. There were a couple of good lines and that's about all. The ""kids"" were annoying and I figured out early on what was happening. I'd only give it 2 stars but the plot had potential and some of the fiends were cool."
3,Dumb but fun...,"If Vincent Price were alive today this is the kind of horror flick he'd make as he was a control freak in many of his movies. A not so typical high tech control room induces a typical group of post HS kids into a horrific night of deadly terror where the outcome can doom all mankind. This is a funfest for zombie lovers and fans of hellacious creatures alike. Even though blood and gore rule, there are plenty of laughs intentional or unintentional. Chris Hemsworth(Thor) and Sigourney Weaver(Alien)lend their star power. They sure won't win anything for their roles other than a hefty payday. ""Cabin in the Woods"" is a good natured horror movie tribute to the genre past with a few added twists. This is fun for the whole family and other than a few curse words the violence is akin to most video games that even 10yr. olds or younger play."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"This movies was definitely not what I was expecting, which was a good thing. I think a lot of people will feel the same way. It's campy, cliched, and the fear factor at times isn't there. But it's a fun movie overall."
1,"Movie was awful, AIV was great","Terrible terrible movie, plot and dialog were inane, characters were flat, jokes were unfunny. All the people saying this is anything revolutionary or clever should try reading a book or two.That said the video quality was great, the movie loaded quickly and played smooth and in HD."
1,Horrible Movie,Horrible movie. Do not watch. A waste of time. Bad plot. Stupid ending. Save your money and watch a different movie. Enough said.
5,MUST HAVE THIS INFORMATION!!!,"This book should be given to each person at birth. If the world were aware of all this information, it would be a much more peaceful place for everyone!"
4,Gets into your roots,Anyone would be helped by this book. Helps you find those hidden feelings that may be holding you back or down.
4,Excellent Resource,"This book has 288 pages of content, of which the first half gives excellent sources and research explaining how & when feelings develop, how these feelings impact our lives and techniques to start the healing process using affirmations. Approximately 100 of these pages (beginning in chapter 17) are dedicated to an alphabetical listing of negative feelings and their positive counterparts to replace them with, followed by affirmations to help facilitate those changes. This section (chapter 18) of the reading also includes an extensive alphabetical list of physical ailments and the `probable feelings' causing them.All in all, I believe this book is an excellent read to have a better understanding of yourself. Yet also believe that are techniques that are more effective, instant and permanent to healing those feelings that have been buried alive. (seeThe Emotion Codeby Dr. Bradley Nelson)"
5,Excellent Filter,"This Sigma filter is excellent quality and great value. I have a couple of other UV filters namely B+W UV 10 and Zeikos filters. The Zeikos is junk, a complete waste of money, no point putting one of these on a good lens as it will just ruin the shot with glare and reflections. The B+W was much more expensive than the Sigma and I found it was a dust magnet, incredibly difficult to clean and dust just seemed to stick to it.The Sigma filter however cleans well, hasn't scratched and provides great protection for my lens. It does exhibit some reflection in difficult conditions but much less than other filters."
5,Quality Filter at Reasonabl Price,I got this filter for my Nikon 18-105 VR len. The filter fits perfectly to the lens for extra protection. The quality of the pictures indoors and outdoors is unaffected. Overall it is a very good multi-coated filter at reasonable price.
4,use this filter as lens protector,"This product performs as expected, used for lens protection withminimum photographic distortion or impact. Does the job."
5,Nice cover,The lens cover works as it is supposed to and pictures turn out very nice. I would buy this lens cover again.
2,Ufff.Nothing new.,"There is NO new strips in this book.And I had read them all before!I payed to get a few strips I had before in color!At least I am not daltonic. If you want to spend your cash on dilbert books,get the black&white fat ones. I should have payed more atention to the book before buying it."
3,"Funny, but of dubious value.","The strips in this book are all funny, of course. But there are only 14 of them, covering 28 pages. If you think it's worth spending the money for so little material, go right ahead; you won't be disappointed by the quality, only (potentially) by the quantity."
3,Reader from Spain should learn English,This is in regard to a coment from reader from Spain. There is NO such word as DALTONIC in english.
1,Bad fit,"I ended up putting this bra in the rag box. I am a 38F and nursing. The first size I ordered was too big, the next size down fit, but the cups provide so little support and the straps are too short so that the back of the bra pulled up practically to the back of my neck. I really wanted this bra to work, because it seems like it could be very comfy, but it just wasn't cut right to fit my body."
1,Not lasting,After less than two years this watch starting emitting a high pitched squealing sound. It went in the trash.
5,great watch,"Got this watch for my 8 year old son. I really wanted a watch with hands to reinforce how to tell time, but was swayed to this one due to excellent reviews. It has an alarm -- which he uses for his daily reading requirements. It fits his arm great and has room to grow. He never takes it off and loves to show his friends at school that it's water resistant. Looks great on him too! It doesn't look too big or too small on his arm."
4,very neat watch,"I bought this watch for my young son's b-day. The elastic band is perfect for him. he loves the watch and loves the alarm feature. really hasn't explored the other features yet, but I'm sure he will in time. He treats it very carefully so I can't comment on durability"
1,It lasted a whole week!,Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be a real Timex product. Maybe it is to be considered a disposable item? Ours broke when my son brushed his teeth and got his hands wet. Hopefully they aren't all that sensitive.
5,Great watch for an active boy,My son loves his watch and has learned how to use it. Seems to never remove it from his wrist and it even went into the shower a few times.
2,POWERHOUSE POUNDING,"PATRICK COWLEY ALONG WITH GEORGIO MORODER ARE THE VISIONARIES BEHIND ELECTRONIC MUSIC. FROM THE BEGINNING, PATRICK COWLEY WAS HANDCRAFTING HIS TRACKS AND IS THE MASTER. ALL THE TRACKS ARE SCINTILATINGLY ELECTRONIC. THE POUNDING THUMP OF THE BASSLINE AND A SEXUAL COMPUTERIZED RIFF COULD CARRY THESE TUNES EVEN ON TODAY'S DANCEFLOORS. THIS IS HI-NRG AT ITS MOST PURE AND DECADANT...ESPECIALLY NOTABLE IS ""X-FACTOR"" AND ""I WANNA TAKE YOU HOME"". IF COWLEY WAS CREATING THIS TYPE OF MUSIC IN THE EARLY 80'S IMAGINE WHAT HE WOULD BE DOING TODAY IF STILL ALIVE. HE IS TRULY A GENIUS. THANKS PATRICK FOR THE MEMORIES AND YOUR MUSIC."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"[[ASIN:B000GPM30E 4 Pocket Remote Control Holder and Organizer (Black) (3""H x 10""D x 8""diameter)The photo I saw had the image it was spiral in design. The product I received had all the remotes straight up and down. The opening of the slots need to be enlarged as it is difficult to place a Wii remote. When shipment arrived the wooden ball at the top of the organizer was split in half. It does save some space but is cumbersome to use."
1,never produced steam,"My roommate bought this at a local store. We plugged it in, followed the directions: it did warm up but even after an hour it was never hot enough to produced steam."
1,Proceed with Caution,"These are nice speakers, but you only get 1 pair of dual cube speakers, not 2 pair as shown in the picture, claiming it is a set. Be careful - you DO NOT get quantity 4 dual cube speakers as shown.- JP"
3,Not as good as the Ladybugs,"My 1 year old loves the ladybug book, so I thought I would buy her similar items so that she could have some variety. It didn't work as I planned. She still loves her ladybugs and I don't like this story as much. It's very pretty, but I feel like it has too much going on. She may be more interested when she is older. Never a bad thing to have too many books."
5,"sweet, colorful and educational","This story is one of my daughter's favorites; she learned her colors listening to this book. The raised butterflies are a great tactile addition to this already interesting book. Bright, colorful illustrations are appealing to little eyes as well as big."
5,"and goodnight to you too, kiddo","I had to read this book to my son every night-- sometimes twice a night. After about 3 months, he had it memorized and he would recite it with me. It's great for learning colors as well as animals and flowers. Read in the right tone of voice and it becomes so relaxing, YOU'LL struggle against yawns yourself! We love this book. :)"
5,I am yet to find a better book,This book has the most spectacular illustrations I have ever seen in a book. It is a favorite for both my daughters and the butterfly's make it even more fun. I am yet to find a book greater or as good as this one. Heck it is my favorite too :)The story has such a sweet soothing tone to it as well. I would recommend this book to anyone with children. It is so great I even took time to write a review on it. that is rare!
1,"Oh PUH-LEEZE. If this is real, I'm Marilyn Monroe.","Yeah, right -- these are REAL student comments. Uh huh. Oh, I just bet.Just a little TOO cutesy, a little TOO pat, and waay too adorable.AND...worst of all, not very funny.Thumbs down."
5,DO NOT OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY WHILE READING!!,I first picked up a copy of this at the local bookstore and had the shotgun rider read to me on our way home. BAD MISTAKE!! I laughed so hard that I was truly a danger on the road. Absolutely the funniest book I ever read! Now for the scary part..it is true! Actual test and homework answers! Just unbelievable! Don't miss this book! I bought a copy for the holidays for all my family! I wish Henriksson would write another!
5,wonderful experience,This book demands interaction but it's well worth the time and dedication to the excercises. Loved it and it helped so much.
2,Never Finished It,"This was recommended by my therapist at the time. Doing the left-handed stuff was kinda fun (and difficult), but it didn't keep my interest as don't most self-help books these days.I think the reason I lost interest in this book is because I AM my inner child! lol I wasn't needing a book to bring that out of me."
2,Author ran out of relevant material.,"The title of the book held great potential. The first half of the publication was okay, however, from there on the author appears to have run out of interesting things so say. It just became run of the mill text. Some authors do that, you know. Stuff a book with more text than is needed. This is the case here. I did not give it a very good rating and I recommend you do not buy it."
2,Just a Sketch,"Only diehard fans of these artists would pursue this theatrical oddity. Cale's mortuary tones blend surprisingly well with Neuwirth's more amiable voice. An astute director may well be capable of giving the thing legs. However, as a suite of music, it falls well short of any achievements either artist has achieved in their respective, lengthy careers. Check Cale's,'Paris 1919', or the more recent,'Locusts' for a more approachable introduction."
2,The bad apple of the barrel,Worlds without end has got to be the worst story of the shadowrun universe. The indepth technoligal/magical outlook found in the other books is noticably lacking. Furthermore the storyline feels like a slow moving slug trying to outrun a path of salt (ie it has no punch or climax). The mysical spirt/demon that threatens the entire world is so easily defeated one wonders why he was such a threat to begin with. The characters are of generic whitewashed stock and can hardly be remembered form page to page. My advice to anyone reading the series is to skip this one so as not to be tainted by an author writting in the wrong genere. For those who have already read the book...FASA owes you an apology
4,"A little was great, am eager for more","Pam Houston has a wise, kind voice and a great understanding of what makes people fall in love with the wild places that she explores and tests herself in. She's the kind of person you read about and wish for as a friend -- especially if you like big mountains, bold adventures and brave dogs. This is a great book for those knarla river guides out there, or just about any woman with a love of the outdoors who wants a little inspiration and insight into their own journeys."
2,"A very honest book, but Pam can do better","I read this book, and felt the same as some of the other reviewers- this book feels very self conscious. Then as I got towards the end, my opinon changed- this book is incredibly honest. I can relate to her feelings during some of her adventures, and her expressed concerns would be similar to mine. My problem with this book is the 'believability' factor. Who has the time and money to do all the things she's done. I find it hard to believe that this is one person adventuring out on her own. I got the distinct impression that she was sponsored by her publisher who arranged all these trips for her so that she would have something to write about. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it takes something away from the feel of the book Also, what happen to her marriage? She alludes that it broke up, but gives no more details. Based on the last story, I can see why she is no longer with her husband."
2,not polarizing evenly,"I have a 58mm Hoya Pro1 Digital CP filter for comparison.If I put the Hoya in front of my laptop screen and rotate it then the picture darkens and eventually turns totally black.With the Sigma, strange intersecting circles of darkness appear. As I rotate it, the dark circles move, but they never cover the whole surface, and they are never totally black. It's quite artistic, like flowers blossoming. But it doesn't make me happy when I want to use the filter on my camera...It's not totally useless on the camera. If you have a refelection on the window it can be as good as the Hoya.But for the blue sky, sometimes only half of the image is darkened. Sometimes you get a dark blue line across the sky, 10% width of the image. The line rotates as you rotate the filter. Again, it's artistic if you have the mood for it, but annoying if you want to do serious work."
2,Sigma CPL,"There is nothing wrong with Sigma CPL. I liked it so far.But the packing was bad. The CPL was outside its case when I opened the box, it has a scratch on the filter."
2,Bewildered,"This book received such high reviews that I purchased both of the holiday books without hesitation. Now I am wondering what happened? The recipes in both books are virtually the same--why buy both? There are no calorie counts, which would have been so helpful to those of us who watch both carbs and calories. Then, in typical Atkins fashion, many of the recipes are so high in fat also, even when it didn't seem necessary. I know it's the holidays and all, but perhaps we might want to at least maintain our weight at this time of year, not gain it! The book chapters were also different--not your typical meats, desserts, salads, etc., but highly specialized. I didn't need a whole chapter on Mexican foods or sauces.Obviously, I was very disappointed. There are many other fine low carb cookbooks out there but, in my opinion, this is not one of them."
3,Much more theoretical than practical,"This book reads like a doctoral thesis. The neural network theory presented is quite complete, if difficult to wade through. Having ""practical"" in its title, I expected far better examples on the accompanying disk. However, the source code came with no make files and no sample data. Many syntax errors quickly became apparent when I tried to incorporate the code into a project (unmatched parentheses, use of undeclared variables, etc.). Once I fixed those, bugs in the code began to surface, such as closing the output file after calling ""return"" and other serious bugs. It is clear that the code has never been actually tested. To summarize, if you already know something about neural networks and want to get deeper into the theory and formulas, this may be the book for you. But it certainly will NOT get you started writing an NN application without considerable effort and additional research."
1,"Cheap, poor quality puzzle","I purchased this puzzle because of the cute holiday picture. Unfortunately, the puzzle was very poorly made, the pieces were cracked and split on the top, and pieces were still locked together in the box because they hadn't been cut all the way through. Because I like to frame puzzles the damaged pieces are unacceptable. This puzzle was useless and a waste of money. 1 star."
4,Good Local History,The book is very interesting and shines a lot of light on the history of Washington Bottom and Blennerhassett Island. Worth the money.
4,Well written,This book was much better written than I had expected. The story was interesting and the characters were compelling. You want to find out more about both the protagonists and villians. Both sides had real reasons for their actions. I highly recommend Dhampir for a good read.
3,A good beginning,I think I'm the only reader that felt more for the vampires. I disliked the ratty faced one that survived but the other two I enjoyed them much more than the heroine. I was really annoyed at the end.
3,A 'musty' read,"I won't go into what the book is about as most other reviewers have already done that.The book is entertaining. I want to read the whole series but I will have to overlook the over descriptive writing (I swear, if I have to read about Magiere's blood red streaks in her black as night hair again I will scream). The plot is good, intriguing, but I found the characters lacking and the writing over-wrought.I titled my review a 'musty read' because at one point Magiere enjoy's Leesil's 'musty' scent. Musty? really? Not MUSKY? well, if you like how enclosed, moldy, spaces smell, go for it Magiere!"
2,Stake it it's dead!,"The critic's review on the cover compared this book to a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Lord of the Rings... Pleeeease! This book fell down flat on it's face. The action ...doesn't keep you interested. The main characters are severely lacking in, well, character. The best thing about this book is the artwork on the cover. If you want better vampire reading, pick up Linda K. Hamilton (Guilty Pleasures, etc) or Chelsea Quinn Yarbro (A Candle for D'Artagnan, A Flame in Byzantium, etc.). This book just dissapointed me."
2,looks good but limps,"The toaster oven looked good, but the ability to make toast was only half functioning; half the elements don't light up. The Avanti service is equivalent; wait for forty minutes to talk to someone and then get sidelined in the phone robot. I'll never buy another product from Avanti. Sorry folks"
5,"superb ,i hope to soon buy all the other books in the series","this is truly a masterpiece. the firstalternatehistory book i've read. now i knowwhat i have been miising. turtldove createsan imaginative saga with likely outcomesi loved every minute of it. he truly knowshow to portray the historical figuresfor an example when hitler makes an outragedspeech after an alien atom bomb lands ingermany i could almost see hitler screaming atme ,turtledove captured him that good. well iincluded one spoiler i wont let yousee anymore,bye ,it was so good i was ableto read it as a stand alone novel iborrowed it from a friend,must read!"
4,Nice Bag,"This bag holds the 1/4"" mat with some extra space. The pockets are useful but not large enough to hold a yoga block, although one will hold bottled water. It doesn't have an adjustable strap but I don't need it. Overall a nice looking bag."
2,Not so good,Cheap quality and stitching. Used it only 4 times so far and the strap seems to be falling apart. It doesn't even carry the mat very comfortably.
4,great gift purchase,"I bought this bag for a Christmas gift. My friend has been getting compliments on it. Everyone wants to know where she got it. She thought it might be hard to get her mat inside, but she said it is perfect. She loves the color."
4,Nice Yoga Bag,"Since I recently started practicing Yoga, I don't have a lot of experience with yoga products, but I really like this bag. I put my personal items in the bag so I only have 1 bag to carry on my Yoga trips. There's plenty of pocket room to put my cellphone, wallet, tissues, etc. I was just a bit disappointed that the shoulder strap wasn't adjustable, but I work around that. One day, maybe I'll buy the matching mat."
3,A wonder to behold,"Argerich's rhythm is impeccable. Although I am not crazy about Freire, he seems to be among the few who can keep up with her! As another reviewer stated, I expected to see the performer's hands a lot more often. AND...I thought the camera spent too much time on Friere and his hands and not on Argerich. After all, it is called MARTHA ARGERICH and Friends. But thankfully, the sound and quality of this DVD made me forget about it for a while. I sorely miss Economou! He and Argerich were made for each other. Their recording of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is a gem. This Mozart 1-piano 4-hands sonata is a favorite of mine and it was a real treat to see. Maisky's performance of Schumann was something else. I had forgotten how beautiful this work was.All in all, this DVD is a must for all Argerich fans."
4,Loved the content but books fell apart,The content of the book was great. I was very disappointed in the making of the book. I personally bought 13 of the books at 3 different locations and everyone of them fell apart. I was hoping the girls that I purchased the books for would be able to keep these for many years or share with their friends...but I don't believe that will be happening. Who wants to look at a book that you are spending more time picking up the pages then being able to read them?
5,Great information for teen girls and young women.,"This book has great information on how men's minds are wired. As Christian women we should want to dress modestly and respect the men in our lives. Since women's minds are not wired like men's, it is hard for us to understand that simply showing a little too much skin or wearing our clothes a little too tight can have such an effect on them. Great information. This book is an easy read and well worth the time."
1,"Good idea, gone bad","This book has a great message, that is terribly shown. She claims eye shadow is more sexual than lip stick (and I went and asked some guys to find out if this was true, it isn't), she picks on tomboys and needs to take a class on gender roles which has nothing to do with being a slut, she doesn't give advice for people who live in hot climates, just says to cover up, she takes Bible versus and crosses out certain words to make her point, I could go on forever! It's badly written! There are many other books with the same point that have better support arguments."
5,A Moment-Lifter Book,"Seasons of A Woman's Heart is a timely treasure in my reading. I love the warm variety of stories and devotional thoughts. Sometimes I read a page while I am waiting to ""get on line"". Lynn Morrissey has put together an uplifting and meaningful collection. It is indeed a blessing. It would make a lovely gift for a friend. My only suggestion is that some of the quotes at the top of each page be a little more complete in thought."
4,Engaging,"As an African-American male, I must say that this book isn't just for the ladies fellas. It is a good read.I was a little disappointed at the end, but taken as a whole, it's worth purchasing. So far I have had about 4 women ""book jack me"" at work within the past 2 weeks. I don't know when I will ever see it again!"
5,Loved the twist and turns of the character,"I really loved this book. I liked the way Ms. Miller was able to show how Regina was able to grow and learn from life's lessons. I also like the way she illustrated the many dimensions of friendship. I am a true die hard fan of E. Jerome Dickey and she rates right up there with him in my book. I look forward to reading ""I'm Telling""."
3,it was okay,"I purchased this book after reading reviews on this page. I read the book in a couple of days, but was very confused with some of the main characters actions. all together it is a good story and moves at a steady pace. I just know i would have written things a tad bit different."
3,Stay Focus,"Don't get me wrong this book was alright yet I thought it should of had a stronger plot and story line. Yet all in all this book had me turning the pages like crazy, it just didn't drive me crazy like her other book ""Im Telling"" which byu the way had from the first page so I strongly recommend that one. Anyway I like it yet it should of had a litlle more edge to it. I like the ending hoe she stood her ground and didn't take him back, although I would of just for one more night of his beautiful ""loving""."
5,Excellent Book,"SATIN DOLL WAS MY BOOK CLUB'S MARCH SELECTION, AND WE ALL WOUND UP GIVING IT A THUMBS UP. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. VERY GOOD STORY AND HAD VERY GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. I CAME AWAY FEELING LIKE I KNEW THE CHARACTERS PERSONALLY. OF COURSE I LIKED REGINA AKA SATIN DOLL, BUT I ALSO REALLY LIKED TAMIKA AND DAVID AND I HOPE KAREN E. QUIONES MILLER WRITES ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT THOSE TWO CHARACTERS."
4,Best for the money,Its a 1080i TV. I have owned it for 2 years now and I am most satisfied by the quaality of image and functionality of the product. No problems so far....touch wood!I wish there were more HDMI inputs but then I have a sound receiver with multiple inputs so I don't have any problems.
5,Grace and dignity don't describe this CD,"Now if you know any of Phillip Glass' works, you have heard that repetative 1-1-1-1-2-2-2-2-3-3-3-2-2-1-1-1 (hopefully you understand) anyhow it is blended beautifuly in this CD especialy on the track ""Mad Rush"" Which when I first heard it made me cry softly on the inside remembering my love for someone else it blended with my mood perfect creating a harmony of my thoughts and music. The track is what my emotions were like and they complimented my mood. So if you like Glass and are romantic and melancholy than give this a try."
5,Valuable study,"I borrowed this book. It is thoughtful, makes the material interesting. Seems meant for undergraduate or even graduate level study. First half of study could be skipped if you are not into the theoretical. Go straight to the second half if you want to focus on the parable commentary.I am buying my own copy because this is a valuable study resource."
4,Needs to go deeper,"This is excellent, and the reader will only benefit. It goes into some detail over the question of allegory (is it or isn't it?!), probably too much so for this to be considered a devotional work. Thankfully Blomburg kicks back against the plethora of snobbish scholasticism against allegory. The thesis is very soundly rooted in kingdom theology, as it should be. However I believe this thesis runs out of steam a little too early. The kingdom only makes sense when seen as the work and reign of the king. So to what extent are the parables actually self-revelatory on Jesus' part? I hope to write a book on that myself some time soon."
2,Obsolete,"I read the first two chapters, poked through the third and fourth, and read the commentaries on a few parables. I found this book very frustrating and nearly useless. Blomberg spends the first couple chapters tediously presenting sides to an argument that is largely irrelevant to any one other than long dead german theologians. If you are concerned with whether parables are parables or actually allegories or metaphors and whether they must contain one point or more, than you might be interested in this book. Reading this book after familiarizing oneself with the studies of Ken Bailey and Tom Wright is sort of like reading an alchemy book after digesting the discoveries of Newton and Einstein."
5,Trapping in northern saskatchewan in the 1930's,Will be enjoyed by anyone who likes to read about life in the wilderness as it was about 60 years ago. A very matter of fact book that I found very interesting .
2,Perky-Pet is too light,"This is a very light pole and it does not hold in the ground well. I live in Kansas and we have lots of wind, I would not purchase this pole again. There are lots of poles out there that will better serve the purpose."
2,Engaging story marred by pedestrian writing,"The intertwined stories of Scott and Amundsen are dramatic reading for fans of exploration and the polar regions, but Huntford's plodding, judgemental style diminishes his book. I would have expected tighter writing and more judicious use of sources from a professional journalist, but I guess he needs a firmer editorial hand. I was particularly irritated by Huntford's unsupported psychological judgements, and his strong tendency to cast every act of Amundsen's in the most favorable possible light, and every act of Scott's in the worst. Nonetheless, it is useful to have the stories told in parallel, and this is certainly this account is a useful corrective to the myth of the heroic Scott."
2,Written with extreme bias,"This account of the race between Scott and Amundsen has an amazing amount of factual material and could be riveting if it hadn't been so full of prejudice and blatant dislike for Scott.There is no queston Scott was not as prepared as he should have been and is to be held in some degree acountable for the deaths of his men, but the author's undisguised reviling of the man and near heroic worship of Amundsen (who was no doubt better prepared than Scott) makes the reading annoying to the point of exasperation at times."
1,Misinformation,"Sad to see so many glowing reviews of this book. Depressing to realize how readily misinformation is accepted as fact with the reviewers thoughtlessly indulging in the spread of misinformation themselves. If you must read this book make sure you also read Ranulph Fiennes' ""Captain Scott""."
5,"Perry Mason - Season One, Vols. 1& 2",I watched many of the shows when they were on television. It is totally cool to be able to watch them again at my convenience.
5,Can't Go Wrong,"Shipping was fast and packaging was awesome. Now unless you are like me you did not look to buy this for home use, you are looking at this for college. However if you are looking at this personal use you can't go wrong trying to learn from this book. It puts everything where it needs to be and it explains everything just as need be. I love it."
1,"Purchased directly from Forzieri, Florence","Not knowing Amazon sold Fontanelly bags, I purchased mine directly from Forzieri, Florence, Italy.What a disappointment. The leather looks like black plastic. The lining is some kind of leather imitation. The pull on the zipper was missing.The bag was supposed to be brand new.I don't know if Amazon reviews or sees the products they advertise. I do not recommend this bag to anybody unless they like a cheap looking plastic bag.Never again.NKPS: Again I want to make clear I did not purchase this bag through Amazon, but directly from Italy."
1,Unusable DVD's,"The first and so far the only pack of 25 Maxwell DVD-RW's I have opened contained DVD's that were unusable. The DVD blanks would not record, over fifteen of them had to be thrown away. I have not contacted the vendor since I no longer have that info handy, but I will research it and contact him (or her). So far the few DVD's that did record, when played back, the DVD froze ever few minutes, making it unwatchable and so unusable. I have not opened the other three packs of 25 Maxwell DVD's I purchased, but anticipate the identical thing happening with them. Something is very wrong here. Aren't DVD's tested before being sent from the factory?Dr. J.W. Durrah"
1,Unusable DVD:s,Bought a sealed 50 pack cheap on Ebay. Tried to burn 15 of them using different burners on 3 different PC:s but none worked. Have now tried 4 more on Mac with same result. Burners can't find discs. Have not contacted vendor but will never buy this product again.
1,very poorly packaged,"***i ordered these dvd-rws on 6-15-11 and they arrived on 6-22-11. in a cardboard box with no padding whatsoever. as a result, the plastic container in which the rws are packaged was cracked at the bottom and a piece came off.i have used one of these dvds for recording in a hdd-dvdr player-recorder and the off-air copy is fine. the 'finalized' recorded video plays in a mac under the mac dvd player, in a pc under windows media player and in a toshiba cd-dvd player. it will not play in my pc under vlc 0.8.6d.i can not comment on performance of the unused dvds nor whether or not the maxell brand product will allow proper erasure and recording in a mac or pc-platform computer.i certainly do not recommend that you purchase anything fragile from amazon (this item is shown as coming from a different vendor but fulfilled (packaged) by amazon.)poor packaging by amazon has been, for me, a constant and long-standing issue, with proper packaging the exception rather than a given.***"
2,Some worked,"Some discs worked a couple of times some continue to rerecord, and some failed the first time. I would not recommend to others."
2,Good condition bad selling,I was happy when my order came I was taking out everything in the package and theirs know game I check online to see my order and it said it brings the game
3,"Good unit, but missing key features","The product is effective at displaying video on the TV as well as playing audio files over the TV. However, I find two missing features very annoying. The first is that only the video displays on the TV, not the iPod menu. You can only navigate the menus directly on the iPod. I have my audio/video equipment in my closest so it is annoying to have to get up and down to navigate the iPod. The second missing feature is also quite annoying. On the remote, you cannot fast forward or rewind a video. When you push the buttons designated for forward and reverse, it goes to the next video or the previous video. It does not allow you to use the remote to navigate the video you are displaying. These issues may be with the design of the iPod navigation design vs. the AirDock itself. Regards it's extremely annoying."
2,easy hookup but poor sound quality,"this product is very easy to hook up to your cpu, stereo, etc. i connected the docking station to my stereo receiver and the sound quality is less than desirable. many folks may not notice the sound quality but it was obvious to me. also, the connection uses the ipods headphone jack vs rca connections. i bought the radio shack docking station and the sound is much improved."
4,"Works very well, PITA to clean","I very much like this grill. I don't use it for steaks anymore but for chicken it does WONDERS. You have to use a meat thermometer to ensure you don't overcook. But with that slight bit of effort this makes the moistest chicken breast I've ever had. People scoff saying.. ugh. you make chicken breast on there? but quite frankly there isn't any better. I tend to make whatever pasta or curry or whatever on the stove but will make the chicken in here. Turns out wayyyy better.Biggest downside, and I mean HUGE downside is the cleaning. the top especially is very difficult to clean. You end up with charred crumbs falling inbetween hinges, and onto the counter. Inevitably ending up on the shelf where you store it. yuck. Easily 10+min to clean it after each use. The white plastic feet also fall out of the bottom repeatedly.. and after awhile you just lose them??"
2,"Great in principle, Poor in fact","I agree completely with the other reviewer who notes that this is a very delicate head. Be warned. It is great for fine positioning of the camera. Great for studio work. BUT I travel with my gear, have to hike to remote locations, work in poor conditions (sand, dirt, wind) and the head has two problems -- very delicate, as mentioned; and prone to drift. I do a lot of timelapse work, and over time, the head can tend to move (along the tilt or pitch axis). Very slightly and quite smoothly, but still noticeably.The main issue is that this head cannot standup to abuse. Mine failed within three months -- I suspect after manhandling by airport personnel.Finally, the gearing mechanism is not -- as far as I can tell -- thoroughly sealed against the elements. If sand or salt (as in salt water) gets in, you're doomed."
5,From A Teen's Perspective,"I have one word to say-WOW! I am thirteen years old and last November my family took a trip to London over Thanksgiving break. While in Westminster Abbey's gift shop, I noticed this book about Henry's the Eighth's wives. The book looked HUGE and I jokingly told my brother I was going to read it. I started looking at it and it looked so interesting I really did end up buying it. Once I got started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I had heard about a King named Henry with six wives before, but this book completely changed my view of him AND his wives. Weir shows us their thoughts and feelings and brings every character to life. After reading the book, I reccomended it to my best friend's mother, who read it and loved it also. After reading it, I began to look for more books on the Tudor period in Great Britain and have become an absolute fanatic on the subject. I learned more from this one book than from all my other history classes combined!"
5,A wonderful insight to 16th century England,I found this book truly fascinating. Alison Wier brings life to the historical facts of this period. I read this book cover to cover in one night! I was simply to interesting to put down.
2,Transit HD,The movie itself was good. The quality of the picture was sub-standard compared to the HD I am used to getting from Amazon. I am looking for a refund on this one the picture was so bad.
3,"""Devil Hunter"" (1980)","Cult exploitation favorite Jes Franco directs this sordid tale about Laura, a sexy model who's kidnapped and whisked away into the jungle, and Peter, the bold Vietnam vet who sets out to find her.Soon, Laura discovers it's not just her captors she has to fear; not only do the locals crave human flesh, but their bloodthirsty earthbound god wants Laura for himself."
2,"Pain to clean, loose construction.","It looks fine and doesn't hurt image quality much but it is a pain to clean. I use a lens pen which cleans my lens and my polarizer perfectly, but this filter gets light smudge marks all over it when I try to clean it. I don't really like how the glass is fit loosely in the metal ring either, so construction does not help. I would pass."
2,Not happy with this book,"The patterns in this book are beautiful, but I found it very hard to follow diagrams as opposed to written instructions. Originally, I was going to order more by this author, but now seeing how the diagrams are, I will not."
5,A wonderful book,"I love this book. All the pieces are very beautiful and gorgeous. By the way, the directions are also described very clear.Just follow the recipe, it's very easy to complete a piece, even you are a beginner."
2,Didn't work well for 40+ lb speakers...,"I intended to use these for my LCR home theater speakers that weigh in at around 45lbs. I just could not find a tightness that kept the speakers from ""creeping"" down over time. Also, they don't work in an ""inverted"" position.I was impressed with the build quality, they just didn't work for me. There are better options."
2,NO REDEEMING QUALITIES,"Just a poorly done movie. Not at all believeable (how was the woman and her Indian friend able to track down the killers, who supposedly scattered in 5 different directions?). The scene at the end, when Keenan Wynn's character is castrated, is painful. There was no apparent reason for the heroine to go stark-raving mad at the end, and it made no sense that she showed absolutely no emotion when the Indian (Henry Silva) was shot at the movie's end, and tried to reach out to her as he was dying. I'm assuming the implication was that the posse was about to be wiped out by the surronding band of Indians, but unfortunately we'll never know, as the movie abrubtly ended."
1,Disappointing video quality,"Ten terrific early John Wayne black-and-white westerns, but most suffer from inferior source materials. Being bargain priced is no excuse for such poor quality in the DVD medium,"
2,What's the point?,"This is overrated! It's so viscous that it's hard to use. It did nothing to improve scars, skin discolorations, wounds.... NOTHING. It's just a messy disgusting corn syrup like goo that was useless. I don't recommend this. I can't believe that the people who say this worked miracles are for real, but I guess I'm just pessimistic because it was useless for me."
1,Defective Filter,"I ordered this filter to primarily protect the lens on my new Nikon D300s. It was extremely difficult to start the filter on the Nikon 18 -200 mm VR zoom lens. It wanted to cross thread and after finally getting to start threading it would bind at and then loosen with each turn. I thought it could be the threads on the lens but after trying another filter I was apparent the Sigma was the problem. For the price I would expect much better quality control in manufacturer. Essentially junk in my opinion. Be extremely careful installing on your lens, if you purchase this Sigma, as you can easily cross thread ruining the lens in the process. Returned to Amazon."
4,Must have,"Me and family have been using sage and white sage for years as an aid for spiritual protection. Every time a reading is done, sage is burning. We also use it to cleanse homes of negative energies. The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because the seller wasn't prompton delivery and the person I bought it for never received it when it was needed."
2,"hard to follow, camera focuses on students doing it wrong","I'm surprised more beginners don't injure their knees doing one or two of the moves. Carradine's voice is stiff, the camera focuses too often on the students behind him who look look like they're doing it for the first time and confused, instead of on the person demonstrating the move. I got this years ago when this was the only Tai Chi tape around. Now that there are many good Tai Chi tapes and DVDs you should get one of those."
3,The Master was excellent...,"...Too bad almost everyone else in the video was NOT, and that the producer and cameramen didn't know what they were doing. If you do the warm ups slowly and carefully (in spite of the complaints about this video's lack of warm ups, the whole first section of the video is nothing but) and then follow the master's moves ONLY, as shown later on in the video, you will build your Chi. I gave this 3 stars because this was the first video workout I ever attempted that actually helped me feel the Chi (regular practitioners will know what I'm talking about); the master was that good. DO NOT FOLLOW THE MOVES OF THE OTHER STUDENTS- MOST WERE CLUELESS AND MAY INJURE THE PURITY OF YOUR OWN PRACTICE."
2,"The Inquisition a Critical and Historical Study, of the Coercive Power, of the Church","I hadn't noticed that this was a classic reprint (my bad), so I was blown away when I saw when it had been written. Interesting how differently we now speak or write. Good information."
3,"Very good overall, but know what you're getting","I really like a lot of the music on this 2-CD set, but I'm a little disappointed in one respect: When I buy piano jazz, I want to hear piano. I do not want to hear trumpet and I most emphatically do NOT want to hear saxophone. This comment only applies to a few of the tracks (I didn't count how many exactly), & I probably will keep the CDs. Despite the tracks I don't want, there is enough good listening here to make them worth the cost. I recognize that many jazz lovers do not share my peculiar tastes & may even consider me a heretic. If you're in that group, you are likely to be more completely satisfied with this compilation than I am."
2,Not Sure It Works,When using this product I have maintained my weight but have not dropped any...I do find myslef eating better and working out so I am not sure if it is the product or the change of lifestyle.
3,Not one of his best films,"I love Fred MacMurray, but this one is not one of his best. Also, the quality of the dvd is poor, very fuzzy and out of focus. What a shame."
5,Excellent Sounds,This truly compliments meditative yoga. It does not distract or compete with my own private yoga or meditation sessions. I highly recommend it.
4,"Cool machine, but one flaw","When I bought my Tivo, I have to say I do love the features that come with the recorder. The onscreen guide and easy to program settings are pretty helpful. There are however, a couple of things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.First, if you're a Mac user, forget trying to use the Multimedia features (Photos, Music, etc.) Apparently, their software doesn't yet support the Mac OS system. Bummer, I look forward to using some of those features.My other gripe is in regards to their ""Lifetime Subscription"" service. Buyer beware on this one. When they say lifetime, they mean lifetime of the recorder that you purchase. So if yours goes up, you have to buy a brand new lifetime subscription (another $300 bucks) along with that new recorder. The average lifespan of these machines from what I've seen is 2 years. My recommendation is to do it year to year ($155 each year for service)"
5,Time Saving TV watching,We bought TIVO for our family earlier this year. Our 16 year old son who is the computer geek of the house had it set up and ready to go about 10 minutes after we got it home.This unit has allowed us to keep TV shows we prefer to watch - available for when we want to watch them. A time saver and stress reliever.
1,Bad hard drive - waiting 2+ months for replacement unit,"Tivo said their warehouse distributor filed chapter 11. I've been waiting for two months for a replacement under warranty. I had to produce a fed-x tracking number for Tivo since they had no record of the delivery even though I put the RMA number clearly on the box and on the fed-x invoice. Tivo is still unable to give a delivery date for my replacement unit.They claim this ""warehouse problem"" has no impact on shipping of new units. But I wonder whether buyers considering Tivo for holiday gifts should beware.The technical problem that caused my unit to fail is instructive. It seems that if a drive has a bad sector that does not contain data when the machine is shipped, the unit will be unable to fix that sector in the future. When it eventually attempts to write to the bad sector the machine will fail. Depending on use, that may not happen for a long time, possibly longer than the warranty."
4,Happy TiVo user,I have been using the unit for about three weeks. My wife loves it because it's simple to use and she can review all the programs she records at a glance. No more tapes sitting on top of the VCR and rewinding them trying to determine where or what programs were taped.
2,TiVo Company Sucks,"My daughter bought me a TiVo for $$$$$. I'll make the story short. It broke after very few hours of play, but after the warranty, of course. I was promised a NEW one by several CSR's. I was sent a REFURBISHED TiVo which was nothing but junk; all scratched up- trash. I had to pay $80.00 for that!!!I sent that back only to be promised a NEW one again, then to receive another REFURBISHED piece of crap. TiVo ended up costing me approximately $900.00 and alot of aggrivation for 18 months of use. The TiVo machine they sent to me sits in a box now, and I rent a DVR from my cable company... TiVo Company sucks. Go Sony or Philips or anyone else better yet- rent."
3,Tivo Series 2 80 hour,"Nice product for the price. Piece of cake to use and set up. 2 things I had to get with it...a Tivo wireless USB adapter, $30, (no phone line) and the IR cables,$11, to change the channels on the satellite box. If you have a standalone DVR, you need the cables."
4,It's Pretty Spunky For Shower Gel,"Could this be the Red Bull of shower gels? Hardly, but Axe's Recovery Shower Gel has a nice tart lime aroma to it that pops those lazy eyes of yours open. The electrolytes in this gel are supposed to invigorate you if you're running slow in the morning. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. All I have to say is that the smell alone will notify your senses that it's time to wake up. I like to alternate the lime scent of this gel with Axe Snake Peel's satsuma-like fragrance. They offer a wonderful one-two punch for gentlemen who work in the dirt and grime all day and then stay up a little too late for their own good."
3,Not bad for an Icon's first effort,"Perhaps this reader has become somewhat jaded relative to this particular genre. And, maybe timing is everything in how a reader rates a book. But this is not Leonard's best work, though it is his first. This novel is a bit predictable, and not a real deep read, but it is not badly done."
2,Altered print of a crummy film (could be a blessing in disguise.),FOLLIES GIRL is a lousy independent production shot in the Bronx and released through P.R.C. exchanges. I have gone into some detail about this film and why it nonetheless has special significance to me. These remarks can be found under this entry on the IMDb web sight.I was very disappointed to discover that the print Alpha Video used for the transfer is 12 minutes short. This is particularly disheartening given that the entire film does indeed exist. I'm not suggesting that Alpha Video deliberately intended to deceive the purchaser but there is I believe a not unreasonable presumption that the buyer of a given film will receive a complete copy or as complete a copy as exists of the film in question.I'll think long and hard before my next purchase from Alpha Video.
5,Remakably good,"These cookies are fabulous. I had gastric bypass surgery 7 months ago, and am always looking for healthy foods that taste good too. These are the best cookies I have found. They satisfy my craving for a sweet treat, without blowing my new healthy eating style.Another good choice is Snikiddy Cherry Oaties, if you prefer oatmeal cookies. These are also great for kids."
3,a few informative pictures...,"I have to admit I was somewhat dissapointed by this book. I bought it mostly for the pictures but was also interested in seeing the country through a rasta's perspective. The text was somewhat informative but there was really not too unique about the information in there. There are definitely quite a few pictures, however I didnt think any of them were all that spectacular. Despite all this I would still give a lukewarm recommendation due to the fact that it is a book about Ethiopia, which isnt to easy to find. Keep in mind this is just my opinion, others may really enjoy it, I guess it just wasnt geared towards what I was looking for."
1,Do NOT Buy,The information in this book is several years old - and very outdated. I glanced through it and threw it away. I was very disappointed.
5,This is the most..,"harrowing and horrible and wonderful tale of a woman who went mad after being raped if I remember at Ravensbruck camp for breeding superior Aryan babies. It is a tale of how she believes a child's her own in modern day times, when it's not her child. Her remaining daughter's haunted by the fact that her mother murder's someone over her deluSional state and it's a harrowing and haunting tale of the daughter's ostracism after the mother murder's. It's so raw, it's delightful, iT makes me feel like I'm there. It's really one of the best books. I've read many Torey Hayden book's cover (many!)to cover.This is by far her best, and her only novel I believe that's based on a true story. MY mother's adopted and German, and there are many tales there, and I wonder how similar my mother's tale is to some of those here. Wonderful. Keep it up.."
3,Somewhat.,"I won't say it totally doesn't work, there are bugs that fly into this thing and make quick work of themself. I wish flies and mosquitoes came into it though, you only get like moths and that kinda thing flying into it. It zaps though, like REALLY zaps."
4,Bug zapper works,"Used this small field outdoor electric bug killer inside our cabin which has faulty screens. Doubling as a night-light, it worked very well to kill mosquitoes and moths. Only problem was with shipping: one of the two sets arrived with a smashed bottom, which turned out not to affect its usage. The plastic material is not very sturdy. Both sets came with the tube bulbs out of the socket, which required screwdriver assisted dismantling to fix. Not a huge problem, but a surprise. Our old zapper did not open for bulb replacement, so this is an improvement on that score. However, the old one was sturdier and metal."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"I read the entire book in one night! Being 25 I could really identify with what Kayla was going through. I liked the fact that the people in the book were so realistic. I found myself so caught up in the book that I was rooting for Kayla like she was my best friend.It was good reading about someone around my own age who wasn't strung out on dope, running dope, or selling booty. Kayla's just a regular young woman out here looking for love. And the situations she gets herself into while she's looking are just too funny. And the drama she goes through is just too real. And listen, what she finally does to Wil at the end, let me tell you, I would do it too.I'm telling, you I'm really feeling this book! I hope the author's next book is about the same subject, because she really knows how to tell it."
3,"Liked it, but ....","I really wanted to get this book, and once I did, I didn't like it. You have this girl who goes around with these guys and eventually gets the short end of the stick, and what is the point? Why are we getting these stories about another sister getting dogged by some brother?? If we continue to put out these things, guess what, the reality won't be no better. But if we put out stories that can give us some semblance of hope at the end of the story, perhaps we can be a more enlightened people. Not to put down Ms.Poole, though I feel she has promise, I am getting tired of the same old same old."
2,IT WAS MORE LIKE HO HO LOVE,i DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BE GING WITH THIS REVIEW BUT. Yo Yo Love could have been better i'm tired of reading books where sitah's drop the panties the first night and don't even know the brother come on people think use your mnind not your behind.
5,The title matched the storyline!!!,"It was an interesting read and very realistic for so many of the women out there. She was a yo yo for real. It should be an eye opener for the Kayla's out there. Quality vs quantity, and she did have quality with Samir . At the time it wasn't her flavor and therefore ended finding love in all the wrong places. Some may realize they already have the prize or have passed it up. Or what to look for in the search. I look forward to reading more from this young sister called Daaimah."
3,Take it with a grain of salt...,"Interesting read, although I wouldn't take much as 'fact'. Throughout the book it's obvious the author doesn't think much of Priscilla. Love her or hate her, believe it as much as 'Elvis & Me'."
4,"Child Bride, untold story of Priscilla Presley","Quick, easy read. Was interested in reading about her, remembered when Photoplay article named her as Elvis' future wife and she was only 14 yrs.!"
3,Child Bride: The Untold Story of Priscilla Beaulieu Presley,This was a well written book but it made me wonder how much was actually true. I have read several books lately and each one of them tells the same story in different ways and views.
2,Italy and Germany Review,"The 30 min. Italy tape covers San Marino, Jesolo, Rimini, Cattolica and Venice. Does not cover the wonderful glassmakers in Venice. The video quility is poor and spends to much time on people and not scenery. Looks to much like a home video and not an informational tape.The narration is good, but does not go into enough detail. If you have been to these places, it might be more interesting. The tape on Germany covers the Alps and Franfurt,Bavaria, Bademia, Wurttemberg and Black Forest. Also includes sites from the cities of Munich, Nurnberg, Wurzburg and Heidelberg.This one has some good scenic video, but the sound quailty is poor and the narration is dull. Once again,if you have been to these places your imagination can fill in the many blanks."
1,Discontinued ************,"Well, I enjoy using the nite time formula, and received a few samples of the AM formula. However, when I ordered this product, I received the night time formula!! My explanatation was that the day time dormula is ""discontinued"". If so, why does the comapny keep incliding samples of the Day formula with the night formula. At least this place should stop offering the day formula if in fact it does not exist. If you order this item, you will not get what you wanted. Just a heads up."
2,Customer Service,"Customer Service is well trained in the art of it's not a problem with the product but with the vehicle. I've tried to fix the problem but all I ever get is the run around. Why not just send a new (passenger side window deflector) so I can finish this project. Every time I open the window and then close it the glass hit the rear corner of the deflector. All other windows work fine (passenger side and both rear doors). First lets try double sided tape, that didn't work. Next take off and re-install, that didn't work. Maybe the weather stripping is to thick. Come on do they really think that they use two differnt size weather stripping when the build a vehicle. I guess mu only option is to return the hold thing when I only wanted one new deflector. Beware."
1,Lost!,"I have not idea what is happening with my order, I placed this about 5 weeks ago and havent got it, the seller has not contacted me yet nor email or anything saying why it is taking so long or if he posted it, I bought another book the same day from another seller and I got that one within a week, I have not idea why this one is taking so long I paid the same money for the delivery, so I'm still wondering if it is lost or if they havent delievered yet or what!!!"
5,Note: This book uses British English,"This is a well-planned book with a clear and manageable format, but if you are using it as an aid to teaching American English, be prepared to explain such differences as the numerous Britishisms in vocabulary, and why there are terms similar to ""in Broad Street"" as opposed to ""on Broad Street,"" as well as other British English grammar variations.Students in the U.S. who learning from the book without an instructor may not realize this at all and find the usage confusing.The explanantions are concise and clear. In a few cases the format can force some complex issues to be squeezed into the same allotment of two pages that is given to more readily learned topics, and I have to rely on additional books for more exercises.Overall I find this an excellent book, but I long for an purely American English edition, so I can use it with fewer caveats to my students."
5,I LOVE Nora Roberts Books,"Having said that, let me say that this trilogy of Born In is one of my favorites. In fact, this set was my introduction to Nora Roberts and I have been a big fan ever after.If you enjoy Nora Roberts books, you will enjoy this one.If you have not read any Nora Roberts books, you are in for a treat. The way Nora Roberts weaves romance with healing, familial ties, and Ireland is wonderful.Although this makes a great bathtub book, it is much more than that."
3,Good read,"I loved this book. This trilogy reminds me a lot of her other Irish trilogy, jewel s of the Sun and the other two. They are all starting to blend together. But I am in love with Ireland and love how detailed her books are."
4,Moving story of love between two strong people,"This is the second of the Born In series that I have read, unfortunately I started from the third book, Born in Shame, so I already knew that Grayson and Brianna would work everything out. It was nice reading about a strong woman being in control of her life and a man looking for a home that he didn't think he needed. Looking forward to completing the series with the first book, Born in Fire."
2,From an Irish point of view...,"I generally love all of Nora Roberts' books, but this series is painful. Admittedly, Born in Ice is better than Born in Fire, but it's still bad. My main problem is that it's set in Ireland and unfortunately, the author is completely unable to write Irish dialogue authentically. It's full of stereotypical Irish sayings which no-one in Ireland says (except to tourists) and for some reason the heroine starts to speak in Gaelic when she's all passionate.. I can't really see that happening.. BUT I still gave it 2 stars as opposed to none because I recognise that it may not be as irritating for other people.. but it definitely irritated me."
5,Excellent little anthology,"This seems to be the only remaining little anthology of Greek drama. It contains two plays apiece by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, and one very, very funny Aristophanes, ""The Frogs,"" which is an especially welcome choice (over the more usual ""Lysistrata"") since ""The Frogs"" is the play which satirizes both Aeschylus and Euripides by showing them having a drama contest in Hades to see which one is best. So it's ideal for the casual reader who wants a good selection of Greek drama, and it's even more ideal for the teacher, like me, who can use it to give students a good idea of the range and styles of the three great tragedians, then end it with a delightfully funny spoof of the same guys. Some of the translations are pretty old-fashioned (too much ""thee"" and ""thou""--the original copyright is 1938), but again for a quick sample of the full range of Greek drama in an inexpensive volume, this is ideal."
4,Definitely Cute,"Yes, it probably was overpriced for 5 pieces of cardboard and some string, but it is very cute. Our daughter seems to like it, and you are paying for the fact that it was a MOMA mobile. Knock $10-$15 off the price, and this would easily get 5 stars."
4,Complete and informative without being overly pedantic,"A detailed yet readable history of a time often ignored. From the 'fall' of Rome to the Crusades, crucial systems of religion, government and agriculture were formed amid the chaos of barbarian invasions and insurgent Islam.This book explains the times from many perspectives, and uses the latest anthropological evidence as well as discerning scholarship to arrive at solid conclusions. The text is not overly difficult to digest, and I believe will be useful to the scholar as well as the general reader."
5,I love it!,"This is the best compilation of the O'Jays that there is, single, double, or how ever many discs, this has all the good songs, hits the high points and doesn't have any ""filler"" songs, all of the songs are very good and the sound is great, too. THIS is the O'Jays compilation to have!"
2,Biased view from an agnostic homosexual host,"McCullough is a homosexual agnostic and does a very Anti-Catholic attack during the 6 programs. Only in the last one do you find out that he's agnostic and homosexual and he even gets an ""Anglican priest"" (in quotes because he's not any kind of real Anglo-Catholic but some liberal) to give his ""the bible doesn't say anything about loving monogamous homosexual relationships"" comments. He seems to think highly of the Orthodox and even the Oriental Orthodox but goes after the Papacy and such repeatedly. I noticed he never mentions the Orthodox killing a bunch of Latins (Catholics) before the 4th crusade when the Catholics had their bit of revenge with the sacking of Constantinople.There was a lot left out...and when you get to the 6th disc you find out why he hates Rome so much since they are one of the few that have kept the ""homosexuality is a sin"" view. Wouldn't have purchased this if I had known he was a homosexual agnostic."
2,"Awaken, My Love","I was dissappointed in this story. I had expected romance with erotic scenes, maybe even something fun. There were too many scene evoking gritty reality that took away from the sensual romance I expected. The old hag was irritating, and the ending was shocking in a way I did not want to see in a romance. I would not recommend this to reader's seeking a sexy love story. Though, the writing did compell me to read the entire story, I was not satisfied at the end."
1,"Disgusting, not romantic at all","I read two of Ms. Schone's stories in the Erotic Anthologies Fascinated and Captivated and thought that they were written with deep felt feelings for the main characters and rather intense, enjoyable love scenes. So I bought this book, and it truly revolted me in places. The heroine is sent back in time to occupy another's body. She is surrounded by an incredibly cruel nurse, abusive family and was sexually molested for several years by an uncle. Once the story line delved into these sober and disturbing themes, I quickly lost interest. How can one think of steamy sex involving the leading lady, when a sexually abusive uncle keeps turning up??? Ick"
3,Pales against Paul Caffyn's Book,"Caffyn's ""Dreamtime Voyage"" is the best on kayaking around Australia. It is more of a 5 star book. And his NZ book ""Obscured by Waves"" is back in print!"
2,cheap,low grade and not all that fantastic.. keyboard cover is model specific. should have went with Mavis. Will buy and review another typing tudor.
2,Shorter life span than expected,"We bought this item new for our office a little over 1 1/2 years ago for $550 (the cheapest price we could find it for at the time) and it served us well, up until it quit working. The copies are a little slow, but it does have many helpful functions etc. I am giving it only two stars because even though it was so versatile and met all our needs it lasted less than two years and cost us $550. (That's over $275/year!!!)"
2,Not a big fan of the curved ends or the size,"I purchased these sunglasses because I wanted a pair of yellow lenses. I was shocked to see the size of these glasses! These glasses almost cover my entire head. I was hoping they would be smaller. I also do not like the curved ends. The nubs at the ends bother my ears and I constantly have to adjust them to stop the irritation. I still use the sunglasses from time to time, but I am currently trying to find a better pair of yellow lenses."
3,ok,"Very vogue the only problem is that its extremely huge. You have to have a super sized face to wear them. I wish it was smaller, a lot smaller."
1,Garbage,"The stems are short. It only fits by looping the ends around and the metal balls poke your ears and are very uncomfortable. And worst of all: IT DOESN'T BLOCK THE SUN! The lenses do nothing to darken the area around you or alleviate squinting, they just make everything an ugly piss yellow color.DO NOT BUY!"
3,better shipping,"the product is o k, but the shipping was not very good. at least 10 brick were broken between the two boxes"
5,"Well written, informative, and enjoyable!","Final Curtain: Saigon is a compelling novel that was difficult to put down. The author reminds us of the politico-economic basis for hostilities between nations as well as providing an understanding of the Military perspective that arises from having their hands tied by that basis. These ideas are the backdrop to a story that reveals the humanity of those that served in the Military during the Viet Nam era which ended with the evacuation of Saigon. The characters are well developed and the descriptions are reminiscent of John Grisham. A wonderful first offering from Colonel Lee (Air Force, retired)."
4,this was thrash metal in 1985!!,"slayer and exodus in studio 54 NYC playing only a hand full of thrash classics exodus with paul bayloff going crazy with bonded matterial but they sadly will not make the cut they should have and be in the pack with the big four and slayer showing no mercy to hell awaits not skipping haunting the chapel either only 4-5 song but you get the feeling that they will crush the rest in a few years come reign in blood and verom shows their grand spectical of live worshiping of venom on stage impresive but short lived glory of venoms history of black metal.If you don't like the video just remember it was 1985 not 2005 the video was not that great and the video special de-fects we low budget and simple,the point disco's dead and thrash metal might have killed them."
1,PDA Case review,This case should be pulled from the market immediately. It is a very poor design that turns over and drops the PDA/GPS out onto the ground. Mine fell out on a concrete stairway and damaged my 3 day old GPS.Do not buy this case under ANY circumstances.
5,Marathon watch,This watch had a fabric band and we thought we had ordered the plastic band. We ordered the digital marathon and were going to send this back but my daughter wanted and is very happy with the watch and band. It was still a good deal compared to other retailers.
5,Excellent Core Bit -No need for diamond bits!,"I used this product to drill (10) through holes in 14""-thick concrete stem wall (we used the milwaukee extension bar and center piece). It works perfect! no water needed. In few holes, we encountered 1/2"" rebars and the core bit (carbide) cut them. You do stop every ~3-in at a time to clear the concrete. We used the small milwaukee 1"" hammer drill to drive the core bit (remember you are only cutting a thin curf so you can core 2-1/2"" dia using a 1"" rated hammer drill). Hope this was helpful."
2,6 Pack Ads,"Product Description""Bug Fighter"" Magnetic/Ultrasonic Pest Repeller. 6 PackIt's nice that they give you 6 of these! You only need one per house so why not give the other 5 for Christmas gifts?"
2,Not heavy enough for a boat anchor,"I bought an X1185 in a weak moment on a Sun. afternoon when I had to print something important. It gobbles the expensive ink and misfeeds every 3rd page or so. On the other hand, it does scan very well. I'm going to buy a printer-only machine and use the X1185 as my scanner. [If anyone knows of a COLOR printer that is economical on ink, PLEASE let me know!]"
4,Great Printer,"I don't understand why others are having such a problem with their Lexmark X1185's . I've had mine for about 2 years now, and it still works as great as the day it came out of the box. Print quality is good for the price, I've printed an array of things with this printer, from simple class notes to Birthday cards with digital pictures on them (which in ""Best"" quality mode, comes out very nice). It's very economical on ink (especially on Quick mode) . Scanning is OK and realitvley good quality (remember, it's only 60$) and it produces good quality copies in both B/W and color. Overall, good printer for the price."
2,Cheap but bad,"I got one of these and it broke within a month. The cartridge holders are made of a very flimsy plastic that snapped when I pulled it up (not w/much force either.) Then I got a replacement which lasted another 6 months. At that point I just gave up because it wasn't one bad batch, it's just a cheaply made, unreliable product so why bother. I've been happy w/my Epson ever since. Avoid this model if you can."
3,page numbers?,"Love the book, but it really needs to have the actual page numbers if you are using it to study for a course. Please add them soon!!"
1,Teacher Review,"In teaching a unit on the racing greyhound industry to my second graders, I was interested in this book to use as a resource. However, after previewing it, I was very disappointed to find that the information listed as fact is inaccurate. Greyhounds are born to run. The ""dialogue"" between racers leads the reader to believe that they hate their lives and are treated unfairly, being kept in locked ""cages"", not fed enough and forced to choke on exhaust when transported. The vocabulary in this book is also inaccurate. For example, the lead-outs which lead the dogs at the tracks are called ""walkers"" by this author. While I believe that the author cares for dogs, I also believe that she doesn't understand the industry and the greyhound breed. This book should not be used as a resource, nor should it be used in a classroom as some of the scenes misrepresent the life of a greyhound."
2,Disc flawed,"Disc one, side one (so far) is flawed: skips, stops, breaks up, etc. Amazon has refused to replace the bad DVD disc. Beware of any DVD sold by Universal as many of their discs are bad."
5,A wild ride!,"And all inside one apartment building! So much fun to read -- one of those books I couldn't put down. (And there are not many of those anymore.) The description suggests that Olivia spends the book looking for a friend, which honestly she doesn't, so if that made you gag a little when you read it, don't worry. If you are wondering whether this is a fantasy novel or not -- well, it is, but it is not really the Harry Potter kind of magical fantasy, much more the Alice in Wonderland type. One of the professional reviews suggested cutting, but the book was far too short for my taste. I can't wait tor read the next one."
4,Definitely worth reading,A quote from my daugher who's 11 and really enjoyed reading it: Even though it had sad moments it was an intriguing tale that was hard to put down.
4,Good book,"Lots of very useful information, easy to read and understand. Use of this book and the QA Primer helped me to pass the CQT examination. Use both books to study for the CQT test."
1,Bogus Title,"The people who are giving this video multiple stars are undoubtedly Alanis ...-and that is fine-she is very talented. But the title of the disc is ""Jagged Little Pill-LIVE!"" and that is absolutely NOT what the video is. It is, as other reviewers have noted, a collection of clips of variable quality, of Alanis and the band in all sorts of situations. It IS NOT A CONCERT VIDEO as the name implies.The only DVD, that I am aware of, with quality Alanis performances is ""The Paris Concert for Amnesty International."" She gives great performances of ""Baba"", ""Hand In My Pocket"" and ""Thank U."""
1,Disappointing,"I saw the review on the Warner Brothers ""demo"" disc, and I thought that this was the video to have, much to my disappointment it was a waste of time and money. I did not like the sound and picture quality. This is definately not for listening pleasure."
1,Jagged big disappointment,"This DVD is lost some where between home video and bootleg. It is too choppy to enjoy, constant changing from one concert location to another, several times during each song. There is entirely too much going on at any singular moment. In addition most of the sound track is of amateur quality. I actual got a headache trying to watch it. Jagged Little Pill is an insult to Alanis fans. You would think a star of her caliber would not allow such garbage to carry her name. As a fan I am deeply disappointed and feel I have been played a fool."
1,Jagged Little Pill Live hurts to swallow,Content of each track is intermixed cuts from several performances. No continuity in either the video or audio. Painful to watch or listen to. Stick with the CD releases.
3,It's OK,"This CD sounds all right... But people seem to think a bit too much of it merely because it was made by someone from Iceland, ""where Bjork and Sigur Ros come from."" It's an admixture of folk-pop and avant-garde or experimental material. The ""earnest"" vocals in the folk-pop songs bring to mind Iron and Wine or some acoustic version of Coldplay -- perhaps too much for my comfort. The experimental material doesn't really resemble or live up to Beck's adept creative twists, as some reviewers have suggested, and it didn't grab me. I just didn't find it that challenging or compelling. In all, the mixture of material didn't hang together that well for me."
1,IT DID NOT WORK,FOR THE MONEY I PAID FOR THIS PRODUCT I THOUGHT I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS BUT IT DID NOT WORK AND IT COST ME $55.00 TO RETURN IT AND YOU ONLY REIMBURSED ME $18.00 REDICULOUS I WILL NEVER USE AMAZON AGAIN WHEN IT COST ME MONEY TO BUY AND RETURN AN ITEM VERY DISAPPOINTED
4,A good place to begin,"This is an excellent resource to begin an understanding of Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. This an excerpt from Piper's larger work. The intent is you would read this, get acquainted with the concepts, and gain a desire to continue to dig deeper. My hope is that you would so that you might find freedom and rest in God's design for manhood and womanhood."
4,Annoying Commentary,"When you first play Rumble Racing, you will notice that only half the game is available to you. To unlock the meatier cars and tracks, you will have to finish the championships. Doing this can be very frustrating, as the oppenents a.i is excelllent. This means that you will be doing the same race for ages, not good.There is also one other tiny flaw within the game, and that is the most incredibly annoying commentator in history. When you land a particularly good stunt, or blow one of the other cars into the air, the commentator will say ""woah, you rawk!"", or in the worst possible case ""I bet you feel as happy as a squirrel on a nutfarm"". This is one thing I hope that ea will rectify for the sequel (and the next, and the next, as is always the case with ea games). Overall: if you are a racing nut, consider this ESSENTIAL-this truly is ssx with cars."
3,great music - looks like a bootleg,"Although the music is great, the copy I bought cuts out in the middle of the biggest hit on the album, Movin' 'n' Groovin'. It sounds like a mastering error. Also, the packaging is atrocious. The cover is a blurry color xerox. The back has really cheesy graphics. Look for the vinyl original."
4,The Best of Sade (on Gold)...,"This is a fair sample of the music of Sade. My only gripe is that as with most ""Best Of"" collections, the songs are edits. That's why I rate this: Four stars!"
3,500 cups,"the book is worth the money, even if your library is well stocked.somebody elses work always gives your own creativity a boost. However, there are too many look-alikes, repeats of too similar. therefor I gave the book only 3 stars."
3,"Beautiful, too bad it rust's.","I received this set as a gift after placing it on my wish list. I love the look and the weight is good, this set is great for casual or more formal dining and it is a classic design. Unfortunately, many of the pieces have rusted. I had read this on previous reviews but still chose to take my chances. So far I can wipe them and remove the rust, but I don't know how long I can do this (had set for 1 month)regardless, there shouldn't be any rust at all. I love the design so much that I reluctant to return, but I may have no choice. Probably would advise to get a different set."
1,Good monitor until it gets some age on it,My monitor worked great until it got about 18 months old. It then started flicker and distort just like some other people have stated in other reviews. I'm going to buy a different brand to replace it.
2,Dying monitor,"I purchased this monitor 3/2003 and it worked perfectly until last month. It has developed the same problem many other users have reported, it flickers for a couple of moments then the image condenses into a very bright horizontal line (approximatley 1mm) across the center of the screen with all else going black. I was under the impression that the monitor was made in Japan but they are made in China.I will never buy another NEC/Mitsubishi produst."
5,Wonderful,"I always enjoyed classical music, but when I listen to Alexander Feht, I don't know what happens. His music makes me feel fresh inside and makes me feel very relaxed. Now, I listen to it everyday since April and the more I listen to it the more I love it. I really think that you should try it, this is not just some classical music, this is something way more than that, believe me."
1,Not Much,"Chessmaster 3000 had a lot more options and variety than this game. There is not much to say about it. You can play several levels of chess. Unless you are a Grand Master, the chess microchip should be able to give you a hard time. As far as variety of options, views, chess sets, etc., this game has very few. I paid [$] for it and I felt it was about comparable to a late 1980s PC Chess game. This seems to have been a game that was put together quickly to make some money, and Kasparov did not care about the product."
3,If you like cinnamon you will love this,"I purchased these to try something new. I like them but expected them to be softer. These are hard. I'm sure they are meant to be seeing as how they are supposed to be ""potatoes"". I'm glad I bought them but in the future I will only purchase as a novelty candy. I think these would be good with coffee..."
5,an excellent book,"I am a student in Classics at the University of Bucharest (Romania), this being my last year of studies. This book has fulfilled my expectations. Being a small book, I can take it with me everywhere, and repeat the Greek grammar. Whenever I translate something from Greek and I have problems with a grammatical form, I look into this easy to search book and I usually find a solution to my problem. Of course, this happens when I don't have time to look into bigger and more profound grammars like the ones written by Smith, Goodwin etc. But, as the author says, this Oxford grammar is based on Smith. I recommend this book especially to those who want to repeat the essentials of the accidence and syntax of Ancient Greek."
5,Hitchcock Sewell is back!,"In The Hearse Case Scenario, Hitchcock's childhood friend, Lucy, is accused of murdering her boyfriend, nightclub owner and sleaze extraordinaire, Shrimp Martin. Hitchcock points out to the police that just because she admits to shooting him doesn't mean that she snuck into the hospital later and stabbed him. The police are not so sure. When they find a witness who saw her near the hospital at the time of the murder, Lucy is arrested. Of course, Hitchcock can't let her go to jail and proceeds to investigate. Hitchcock's snappy one liners and dashing good looks endear him to readers and his unusual profession gives him lots of opportunities to investigate murders. Fans of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series should get a kick out of Hitchcock Sewell. The first title in the series is The Hearse You Came In On and the second is Hearse Of A Different Color."
4,pretty good,I liked the idea of the book- the underdog/ shy donkey finding that he too had something to give the baby Jesus .I was hoping for a book that highlighted some aspects of the nativity- something that would reinforce what I am teaching my children about the birth of Christ. I nice book but not an historical teaching tool.
4,A great idea,"I received this as a shower gift and love it. It is soft and easy to throw over the shoulder. I am excited and looking forward to using it often. I am concerned about modesty and not being noticed while I am nursing. Mommies who feel the same as I do will enjoy using this cover. The cover is a great idea as it can be thrown right in the wash for easy cleaning. It would be a great idea to have two actually, in case the baby spits up on one. The price is quite reasonable as well."
1,Technically Correct,"Technically correct, and DULL. The notes are all in the right place, the hair is slicked down so that not a single one is out of place, and it is fast. Well, hurray for him. I don't know anyone who doesn't have a recording of either piece that she wouldn't favor over this one. This recording is best the first time you hear it. Then it sinks into oblivion. The Beethoven is played just like the Brahms -- fast, and technically correct. Whoopee!"
1,Emphasis on ART,"No science here, just some examples of short sales that worked--eventually. Not a particularly valuable book, unless you learn by example (I don't) If you went to business school and studied cases, you could probably figure something out in this book. For anyone else, I wouldn't bother."
3,Many pictures,Also likes this book. Bought it together with another book about wrapping.It has lots of pictures and for a beginner that is good. I still would have liked a little more exciting things. I didn't use this one as much as the other book. Will still be looking for more special wrappings books for beginners :-)
3,Vintage Janet,"The overall story was weak but who really cares; we just want to see Janet dance, right? I may have gotten a defective copy but ""black cat"" was not included on my tape."
2,North indicator is wrong on the maps,The first two maps I have looked at have the North arrow pointing in the wrong direction. Yikes! Wolf Mountain and Lost Pines.
2,Pretty disappointing,"This book was overall disappointing. Some really interesting story ideas and plots were rendered almost unreadable by a wordy telling that came off as immature. The overuse of foul language and sex didn't fit the storyline and seemed to have been written by a fifteen-year-old. Descriptive sections were far overdone in a way that almost made this a skim read for me. My overall rating is 'disappointing' as I would have liked a more concise, mature treatment of the storylines of the virtual rock stars and the underground conspiracy. It even could have included a bit more exposition as to how the national situation occurred. Bottom line, not recommended."
3,Excellent as a quick intro to idea mapping methodology,"This is a very simple book (actually a self-published booklet) to read, with some simple exercises to do...no frills!...and gives an excellent introduction to the idea generation and mapping methodology. However, the printing of the book - the typeface - is not so good for the eyes, especially when readers are used to reading other high-quality printed books."
1,does not work,This product is cheaply made and made absolutely no sense at all when you wear it. After few month of wearing no changes was observed. Waste of money
3,"Not "" very good"" condition","I bought the book from this seller, because it was listed as ""very good"" condition. However, the dust cover looked pathetic and there were stains on the pages and the best I can rate the book is ""acceptable"". If I knew the condition was going to order from another seller."
1,Not Impressed,"I thought this book was going to be full of great recipes for parents who have kids with food allergies. Some of the recipes tell you ""common sense"" things; substitute egg with Energ egg replacer, which if you have a child with egg allergies you know that. It has a recipe for Easy Mac that has noodles, butter and a cheese packet. That is the recipe on the macaroni box. Sorry! I feel like I wasted my money."
2,Rice flour bias?,"This cookbook was disapointing because it seemed that the only flour used in most recipies is rice flour. My 22 month old is alergic to wheat, dairy, and eggs, so I have the freedom to use multiple other flours that contain more protein - and I prefer to. It's hard enough to get veggies in him and meat protein is next to impossible. I'm having a hard time finding useful recipies in this book."
4,Nice But Too Large For My Needs,"I won't make this long. It is the same quality as the 488RC2 which I reviewed as well and would recommend over this model. My main issue is that I wanted something ""compact"" and the 6 sided plate just is too large for my tastes. Nice, sturdy quality product but it just isn't for me.Canon 50d, 30d, 10-22, 17-85, 17-40L, 70-200L/F4 IS with ring, Sigma 50 1.4"
3,interesting beginning / got bogged down at the end,I felt the book made good reading until the last several chapters. Perhaps it loses something in translation?
2,Poor quality.,Poor quality. Thin. Not heavy enough. T-shirts will wear out quickly. Will not order again. I could have found better quality cheaper elsewhere.
3,Order larger than you think,"Unfortunately, I did not read reviews before I purchased these t-shirts. DEFINITELY order at least one size larger than you normally would."
1,Super wide neck!,"These were decent shirts, but had a super wide neck. I was planning on using them as undershirts for my uniform, but after placing them under my shirt they looked sloppy. I sent them back."
5,A practical book on healing,"""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" by David Burchett is the best book I've found to date on helping folks who've been hurt in the Church heal. He talks to both pastors & parishoners about how we hurt each other and how we can change that & his counsel is actually practical! Mr. Burchett had to go down the hard road of learning how to forgive & heal because of the wounds he received in the Church."
2,"More of a book for church leaders, not parishioners.","Our church split after a very ugly feud, and I'm still walking through the healing. I thought this book would be helpful, maybe provide some fresh light on these issues, however the ""healing plan"" (as described in the title) is more for church leaders. It offers church leaders tips on ""finding"" the lost and assisting the spiritually wounded when they return. As for parishioners, the author basically reminds us that we are all the Body of Christ, we are all needed, and we are all important. This is all true, but it doesn't offer any guidance for healing or learning to trust again."
5,another good buy!,I love this case! It just works for me! The only con to it is that it smells like they just killed the poor animal to get this leather..LOL! But it's great- I expect it to last for a loooooong time.
4,book,cute little book. looked thru it. have not read yet. we will read when we get a chance. done with this
4,Hard eyed view of bargaining,"The focus of the book is put straightforwardly: ""To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated. And it has to be avoidable by accommodation. The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy--vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy."" This book was first published in 1966 and it is a realpolitik examination of the use of coercive power in diplomacy. Important issues addressed include the centrality of making clear one's commitments, manipulating risk, the use of military action in bargaining. . . .A classic from the 1960s that can make for uncomfortable reading but which illustrates the hardball conceptualization of what we might term coercive diplomacy."
1,Don't waste your Money!,"This anime is truly awful. I found myself making fun of it then enjoying the story. I never finish the whole series, because I could not sit through the first couple of episodes. At first the story was cute and fun , but then the plot got confusing and I lost interest quickly. This series could of been so much better. I recommened rented this before you buy it. That way you can form your own take on the anime. Overall, I thought the anime was too random and confusing. ""Sailor Moon"" and "" Ah! My Goddess,"" are animes you want to continue to watch over and over. "" Magical Meow Meow,"" Is a anime you want to return."
5,Baby Loves This Pillow,"I received the pillow as a shower gift. I was not able to breastfeed so I did not use it in that manner. At about 2 weeks I laid my daughter in this pillow and she loved laying it, so much so that most times she will fall asleep in it. She seems very relaxed and comfortable. We use this pillow each day, we just keep it out at all times. And we take it with us when we take her to Gramma & PawPaw's."
5,New to Sushi,"I purchased this knife based on the reviews I read and I must say I was pleased with the quality of workmanship and the knife is sharp! This is the first Japanese blade I have owned and it is impressive. I struggled a bit with getting clean cuts but I think this is due to my inexperience at Sushi making. I would certainly recommend this knife to anyone as first time purchase. A good combination of quality, sharpness and price!"
3,B Horror,"I got this in a set of four horror DVDs for one low price which I couldn't find listed here. At least this one's claim of a nudity flag actually did contsin some skin scenes. Not bad and worth seeing at least once, and as alternative horror it does work. However, I would not recommend it for anyone than horror buffs/ enthusiasts. Also cotains martial arts vampires."
4,Love the Opera,"Before I went to see this opera, had ordered this rendition that my mother had when I was a teenager. She loved Leontyne Price singing the lead and I liked the fact that this package had the story of Puccini the composer of it, also the translation with the story of the opera. Great deal in stereo and wonderful memories of my mom's favorite opera. Sad story but beautiful music and singing. Fantastic music of Puccini plus got it shipped free even. Thanks Amazon."
3,"Sorry, but...","Sorry for what's coming. I write this as a big ADGTH franchise fan. I really like the second movie; thought it superior to the lush but meandering original. I liked the series - thought ir underrated, but this... well, it's certainly not bad, but it's ordinary. The animation is sub-par for even a 90's DTV movie, and there is little of the relationship-tension which made The Series enjoyable. I must admit I'm not a Christmas Special fan (about the only ones I can stand are the Rocko's Modern Life one, and the first Robby the Reindeer) but even so, I think this is the tail-end of the ADGTH franchise. It's not good. It's not awful either. Ironically, I'm now going to be dissed by - ah, nevermind. For completists. I'd rather MGM released all The Series episodes on DVD."
5,Overall the All Dogs series is a very good series,"Overall the DVD was good and very much appropriate for young children. However, after a couple of weeks it had fallen to the back of his preference list. We've not watched it in over a year now. I guess this isn't so different from any other DVD we have.I would recommend this for young children. It does have quite a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent."

5,Five stars are not enough for this magnificent set!,"Finally, after all these years, we get a dream come true! I won't go into the details of this spectacular double-DVD set except that if you are a hardcore Simple Minds fan (like I am), you should definitely buy this. You can't go wrong with 26 promo music videos and a full live concert!"
5,Comprehensive Collection,"Bought this set for a true Simple Minds fan. They were blown away with all the extras, mind you, you could buy just the concert in Verona for a quarter of the price, but my friend said the extras and videos were amazing. This was a Christmas gift which really made someone happy. I was able to buy through Amazon at a reasonable price given the fact that is a discontinued collectors item."
2,Seen the Lights - Visual History,"I love the Simple Minds, but not this set. I felt it was poorly made patches of their work, which did not do them justice. The audio quality was all over the place. I sent this back. So sad."
2,What Now,Macgyver is the best show ever in TV I don't know any one would buy this set all you are getting is the whole show all 7 seasons at once but if you are a fan like I am then you already have all the shows -the 2 moviesI whish they wouls release them by them selves Or what would have been better is if the had put them in season 7 set I have know idea what CBS is thinking unless it is to fatten up their bank account.
2,"Love MacGyver, but the disks have lots of scratches","I purchased Macgyver - The Complete Series. I supposedly purchased a new set sold by Amazon and not a third party. It came shrink wrapped, but many of the disks are scratched and have lots of skips. I can access most of the scenes by laboriously rewinding and fast forwarding to ""trick"" the scratches, but it is not the enjoyable ""Let's watch all the episodes!"" that I was paying for.MissyMacgyver - The Complete Series"
4,macgyver,hi its a great series love it. I would tell other people about it I have bine watiching just about a show averydayjohn
1,Very Displeased,"I'm not quite sure what Paramount's rationale was for only including the two made-for-tv MacGyver movies in this set and not releasing them individually for purchase. Like some of the previous reviewers, I bought each and every season as they were released, being a huge fan of the series, but this is borderline insulting the way Paramount is handling it's marketing. I will not buy this set to simply obtain the two missing movies because of how much money was already invested in purchasing each season seperately. This is a very disappointing and obvious marketing ploy by Paramount to get more money out of die hard viewers."
4,What a great price! But read on...,"You get the entire series for a great low price! The trouble is that the packaging is not very sturdy. All the discs come jammed into a rectangular box, there are no individual sleeves for each dvd. Also when I opened the box the first day, the cardboard case came apart! It is a great value, but cheaply put together. I would recommend the item if you are not too choosy on the storage of the dvds."
2,"Great show, poor packaging...","As a longtime fan who (like many) waited patiently through a long period for the show to arrive on DVD, and purchased the individual season sets faithfully on their release dates, the content itself of those sets does not disappoint, although special features would have been nice. Given that this collected set was released later, some extras would perhaps have been expected, and to see even the packaging on this collection become more miniscule is puzzling.I was intrigued by the two additional TV movies included, since I had not even been aware of their existence at all... but it appears that the pair will be released as a separate product for $15 on June 15, 2010 - so anyone wanting only these may want to wait:MacGyver: The TV MoviesIt's going to be a good summer for some looong overdue '80s adventure series, which I never expected to appear on DVD.... :)Tales of the Gold Monkey: Complete SeriesStreet Hawk: The Complete Series"
1,unusable DVDs,"Do not buy this set. Other reviewers have noted that their DVDs were scratched, and this is absolutely accurate. Not only that but in 25% or more of the episodes, the DVD just freezes, and starts playing the entire episode over again from the beginning. There is no way to fast forward or skip the broken parts, and why should you have to? You paid for the whole season, but you'll be lucky to view 3/4 of it. A rip off. These are worse than bootleg copies from China. The distributor should be ashamed of itself. All buyers should get a full refund."
2,Nice set but too late,I'm sure this is a nice set and having the TV movies is nice but I'm sure most serious fans have already bought the single sets and aren't getting the TV movies for their trouble. To trade in the old sets and buy this one would be a rip off. So I gave this two stars because it is Macgyver and if you haven't bought the other sets this is a deal but for those of us who have bought the other sets are getting the shaft. Thanks
2,Israel In Song,"DVD came when expected in brand new condition. Plays great. It is just not what I expected. I had hoped there would be more traditional dancing, but it is mostly singing."
4,Better and faster than the rest,"I used three of these GT drives (2 and 4GB) regularly. The drives are faster than any other flash USB drive I have used. They work well on OS X and windows, transferring files from one platform from the other without incident.I only spotted two flaws. As with many of these drives, the cap is very easily lost. The memorex drive has a nice cover but are relatively slow. The Memorex is a good design but not so fast.The other flaw is it simply unmounts itself from OS X under *extreme* use. I tried putting my mail files on the drive so I could pick up mail on any of my Macs. The database was corrupted several times when the drive suddenly dismounted itself. The manufacturer indicated that it just draws too much power under those circumstances it will fail. This problem never occurred under ordinary use."
5,Best Loved Poems of the American People,This is one of the greatest poetry booksIt has a wide range of subjectsand I was so happy to find it .there just isn't anything like it in today's marketI think everyone should read this book It will make you laugh and cryit is that good .
1,Doesn't work after PS3 Firmware 3.50 update,"I never got a chance to try it out. I had to return it right after I bought it. One month prior to me buying this product, there was a firmware update on the PS3. When the package arrived, I was dying to try it out, but to my amazement, the PS3 does not recognize the joystick. I did some research and found out that this joystick is no longer supported by the PS3. It may work with future updates, but as of now, it doesn't work."
4,Not bad,"I bought this for purposes other than playing fighting games (but do use it for fighting games)Briefly1. the stick itself is not tall enough; from the base to the ball its like an inch and a half. For people who like to use the palm of their hand instead, this may be hard, especially with bigger hands2. the top part rotates; not sure if this is a positive or negative quality, but when i move the joystick sometimes i just rotate the top while not moving the stick, theres no friction from the ball on the metal post3. The base should be bigger so you can rest at least some of your hands in front of the buttons and next to the joystickOther than that, for 45bucks...this is pretty hard to beat, the quality is very good, inputs are accurate, the buttons are not flimsy...cant beat this stick at its price...its just a less expensive alternative to the 100+ ones -- drawback is its size...great stick on a budgetNOT WIRELESS"
3,fight stick,"great product over all arrived earlier then the estimated date. my only complaint is I didn't know that it had a square gate on the joy stick as opposed to a circle, and it kinda makes some games a bit awkward. other then that im glad i purchased it. good price too."
2,not good,Only buy if you're new to arcade sticks and looking for a cheap one to start out on. Once you start to play games that require very quick and frequent button presses its time to graduate because soon your stick buttons will fail on you. They will short circuit and become useless at a accelerated pace. Games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and 3 require a higher quality stick and this isn't it.
5,Good Product,"Of all of the armbands to buy, this one is the best. It has a 2 stage system to protect your ipod from drops, and from sweat."
3,home-spun stories of life's lessons...,"This book is a collection of anecdotal stories that show that even in life's rather whacky moments there are lessons to be learned. Baumbich shares her home-spun stories about things that have occured throughout her life, and taught her many things. These lessons are not always pretty and they are not always easy, but the lessons seem to flourish! Charlene Ann Baumbich points out that not all these lessons need be painful or embarassing, sometimes they are a pure unexpected delight.This is an easy book to read in small bites and is the kind of book that can be passed among friends."
1,Not one hummingbird,"I bought this feeder to replace my old feeder that kept getting taken by raccoons. With my old feeder, I always had a hummingbird at the feeder. With this one, I have never seen one hummingbird. Looks like I will be buying the Hummzingzinger Ultra again."
3,No Instructions? No Manual,"I don't see how the parts assemble. There is a no manual, even after searching online. The company that makes it doesn't have a website? WFT?!?! It looks great. Hope it works..."
4,It works if you add red food coloring!,"This is a great feeder because it holds 8 ounces rather than the huge feeders I've found other places. The birds can easily perch while they're drinking but it makes for less spectacular photos when they're sitting that's for sure. Use 1 part sugar to 4 parts water and make sure to add some red food coloring! The birds won't come unless I add the coloring. In the photo, the entire feeder looks red, but actually the container is clear glass filled with red liquid. When you invert the feeder after filling it up, do it really quickly or else the liquid will spill out one of the flowers. It's fairly easy to clean and it's a nice cheerful looking feeder. Most importantly, it gets the job done!"
4,Not a bad option,We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works.
2,"Looks good, Terrible sound.","I bought this much hyped earphone. But after hearing its sound, I immediately returned it. It sounds like I'm hearing music through a blanket cover a speaker. It's even worse than the stock earphone from Apple, except maybe the low end. I ended up buying a Denon,which is excellent for a good price."
3,Lack the punch.,"After reading through hordes of reviews I finally took the plunge and bought these bad boys. Sadly, after a week of ownership, I can say that they fell short on promise.They sounded harsh and tinny the first time I put them on. So, I let them ""burn in"" for two days. There was definitely some improvement but it was still missing the punch.There is nothing wrong with these phones, they sound very clear, crisp, and accurate. My problem is with bass. It's there but simply not enough of it, and I am no bass head either. My suggestion is that if you are into rock then these buds are not for you."
2,Awesome sound; VERY FRAGILE,"I was amazed at the sound quality of V MODA. But I don't see the point in shelling out $100 for quality that doesn't last. That sounds conflicting in itself, but that's exactly what I experienced. The plug-in is very delicate. I read somewhere that you shouldn't curl the earphones on ur ipod, like we all do, because it creates tension in the plug-in area. My v moda died just because of this. I was so dissapointed!! because I was careful about my earphones for that very reason. I mean, the cloth protection and all gives it a sturdy look, but it all makes no sense when the earphone breaks down from the inside when everything else looks picture perfect on the outside...now how is that sturdy?? GREAT SOUND QUALITY, HEAVY ON THE PRICE AND MORE ON THE FRAGILE SIDE. WHAT A SHAME!"
1,Could this book BE any worse!?!,"I dislike reading. My mom bought me this book. I opened to page one and closed it immediately. It was bad. Those other refviewers lied. I especially hated the story about Brian and Marissa. I would never recomend this book. I think It could only be worse if Chinua Achebe wrote it.I hope you disliked it too...Peace out tree flowers, until next spring.."
2,Not what it appears,I ordered this head with a manfrotto table top tripod. The micro ball head bore (screw top) is too large for any camera I own. It appears this ball head may be for another type of camera (video) although I cannot find anything in the listing that indicates what it is used for. I've had to order another head to work with the Manfrotto tripod. It is too bad because this is a solid head otherwise.
1,piece of crap. dont buy,it says os provides drivers--WRONG. it crashed my computer and i spent 3 hours looking for the drivers. 25$ down the crapper. very poorly designed. shop elsewhere. i cannot say more what a waste of time and money this was. pci card didnt really fit in the standard pci slot. for god's sake stay away!!!!!!!!!!!
4,is a good game,tony hawk is good game in 3d with fun levels with many things to do but the problem in the game is you get bored after a short time becouse in all levels you do the same tings and also few levels to play
2,Beware!!! This game is VERY DARK (almost imposible to see),"Literally, this game is too dark to play without eye strain. Although the Nintendo version of this game is also dark, it's played on a much larger screen. However, on the GameBoy Advance screen, unless you're playing outside in daylight, forget it (even with a worm light). I pre-ordered this game along with the new GameBoy Advance and misc. accessories for my son's 8th birthday and had to return the game (Tony Hawk's Pro-Skater) this morning. I've since ordered Rayman via Amazon - hopefully it will be ""brighter."" If Rayman is as hard to see as Tony Hawk's I will return the machine. We have the original GameBoy, a Nintendo system and both Playstations (I and II) and I have NEVER RETURNED A GAME UNTIL NOW."
4,Awesome Game!,"THPS2 was my first GBA game and by far one of the best. The graphics and the reality blow most other games out of the water! The boarders have ther own riding styles, air time, and tricks that they have in real life. The tricks can be hard to do, though. Performing tricks can be a random affair; press as many buttons as you can before landing, and hope that the landing is smooth. My point is that the tricks are hard to remember and do more than once. Still, once you get used to it, it gets to be an AWESOME GAME!"
5,Hawk has finally launched on the GBA,"When I bought Tony Hawk 2 for GBC I was very dissapointed beacuse the graphics and the gameplay were horrible. When i got it for GBA, I compared them both and the one for GBA was 10x better. The detail on the skaters is amazing for a handheld. The levels are exactly the same as the console versions. I liked the Warehouse level a lot. The only things I don'tlike about this game is that there are no cars, no park editor, and limited levels. Otherwise this game is awesome and it is really cool. They should come out with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1, it would be awesome."
2,"You're not an idiot, but the editor of this book might be.","The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth, unfortunately, is a poorly-written and edited book. Although the information contained within is crucial, the author's writing skills need work. The text is often confusing and occasionally misleading. Occasionally, statements in the main pragraphs are contradictory to the factoid windows peppered on the same page. Likewise, important information found in the factoids are often missing from the main text. Sentences are often repeated in the same paragraph. Grammar is poor - for example, 'You're' and 'Your' are often mis-used. Frustratingly, a large number of grammar errors seem to have been addressed too hastily by the editor, which just makes matters worse.While the book contains a wealth of useful information, it is a chore to read. Pregnancy is an important and busy time - no point wasting any trying to decipher poorly-written paragraphs."
2,Not For Everyone,"I realize that women are either more liberal or more strict during their pregnancies these days, however after only spending about 15 minutes with this book, I realized that it wasn't for me. Some of the advice given in this book is just bad if not blantly dangerous. As if giving women permission to do things like smoking and drinking indirectly. And obviously women will choose to do what they wish with their bodies, but if you're like me and try to take really good care of yourself by not practicing the above listed risky activities it's hard to take this book seriously at all."
3,Why music ids are missing?,"Since 1974 this is the first time I'm not buying the WRTH. Quality has gone worsening in the last ten years, and -- as stated by other readers -- the strange splitting-editing is not handy. More: there is something I don't understand, and people at WRTH never answered to my two letters: the suppression of music identification scores. OK, not everybody can read music, but often the music id is the only way to identify a rare station in some exotic languages. Add the fact that often the station/program presented in the WRTH schedules is totally absent on the frequency. If editors at WRTH are not interested in doing a good job, I'm not interested in wasting my money."
3,Pros and Cons,"I found the following might be some good infos for buyers...Pros: Comic collections. Movie Viewer. Movie Scenes for Spiderman fan. Guest appearence(Punisher, Dare Devil, Captn' America, Black Cat, and Fireman). Different outfit for the Spiderman(Captn' Universe, Symboite, 2099 and etc), each has its special abilities. Game Play: Webbing, Swinging, and Fighting.Cons: Game Play Control: The analog feature for this game on dreamcast is annoying. Slow Loading. Special Customs throws the difficulty level off. Training room. Game is too short. Dissappointed ---> You don't get to fight the Dr. Oct in Symbiote mode."
3,Still Waiting,"I'm sure this concert will be very good, if I ever receive it. Amazon.com says the average ship time is 3-5 weeks. I've been waiting 7. If you can find an NTSC (North American coded) copy anywhere else, I would order from them instead. I'm still optimistic that I'll receive this by the time summer rolls around, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
3,its okay,most of the episodes are boring and lacking in drama. the lead actors are not remotely appealing. a few episodes had decently good stories.
1,Different formulas than the required reference book.,This book was very hard to follow. What really stinks is that the formulas aren't the same as the ones in the required reference book that you are allowed to use in the exam.
1,Fun and Challenging missions??? Nope.,"I got this game because i read a lot of reviews and most of them said it was a good game. when i first played the Novice missions, it took about 10-15 minutes to complete all 15. and the missions were just basic training. When i got into the level 2 missions they were basically the same. the boards are just 1 room which is no fun. i bought this game thinking it would be some what similar to Goldeneye 007 for N64. I was wrong. the controls are very difficult to use. the D-pad makes you move. the Analog stick moves your aim. the L and R trigger turn you and the L and R on the D-pad make you side step. Very confusing in controlls. I would highly recommend renting this game, if you even want to take that chance. The 2-4 player games are just the same you can play on teams but since the board you are on is so small, 2-4 players is no fun. Not a good game to add to your collection."
4,awsome game with one flaw,"i would have given this game a five star rating but it had onedown fall, the controls. ...... in the option screen u can change the pre set controls toother made up controls but then the other control options areeven worse. but besides the controls the game itself is off thehook. the graphics are great, the music is great, the game playis great, and the weapons in this game are just too much.perfect dark wished it had weapons like these. i mean there aretons of weapons to unlock. the game is just completely awsome,but like i said before it's major down fall is the controloptions. i hope i haven't stop anybody from buying this game.it's probably the best team shooting game on the market today,until u get use to the controls."
1,Don't fall in,"This game absolutely stinks.the repetitive gameplay is annoying.every mission is basically the same dang thing.you can only use 3 wepons really and The missions are exactly the same as training mode.Go spend your dinero somewhere else, like Quake III or unreal tournament.You shouldn't have to pay for this piece of munkey dodo!"
1,"Terrible, obsolete computer","We use these computers in school. Last year, we had iMacs. These are even worse than those. They lag all the time and crash frequently, even on word processing. You could pay the same amount for a brand new shiny PC, or even probably another, better mac. Just don't buy this computer."
2,More of the same,"I eagerly opened this game, started up - and was almost immediately disappointed by what became a theme of the game: it wasn't designed for the Wii. Don't get me wrong - it works on the Wii - but why are we back to using the analog stick on the Nunchuck for character selection instead of using the pointing abilities of the Wii remote??As others have said here, it's a very slight improvement on Melee - if you own that and love it, just break it back out and keep playing. Save yourself $50. It reminds me a lot of the Madden franchise - slight changes every year, a little something new, but really not worth upgrading every single year.I'm thinking of trying to sell or trade my copy, too - total waste of money."
4,Group Fun,"Its a good game. Even for someone like me who doesn't play a lot, I think its great for group fun! Get together with a friend or two, add in the computer characters to fill the remaining spaces and let the fun begin!Also, its not just fighting, there are challenge boards and an adventure series, plus you can play online!"
4,Overrated!,"I was chirrping at the bit to get my hands on the Wii version of Super Smash Bros. Sadly, I am a tad dissapointed, because it just isn't as fun as the hype made it out to be. Yes, the single player game addages are fantastic; they are much more indepth, with more to play with and unlock, also a long story mode! But, the big draw back and the reason this game was over hyped is the online play. Unless you have a ton of friend codes registered finding an online match is incredibly difficult. You ""can"" play with random people but it takes forever to find a match, and usually by the time it does the Wi-Fi connection gets dropped.Anyways, this is a really good game, but just not nearly as good as all the 'forum normies' would like you to think. Buy it if you have friends to come over and play it with you, but don't buy it for the online support!"
3,alright,I have not played a Smash Bros. title since the N64 version. This is so similar to that one I jumped on it and was playing right through it and doing quite well online. I don't know what developments I was expecting in almost a decade but I was expecting more. I think The Subspace Emissary was fun and really the only really original thing although it was pretty short. Break the targets was even there and that wasn't really fun the first time.
4,Another good game in the series,"If you like the Smash bros series, you should get this game. There's lots of fun to be had with friends, but aside from the new characters, there's little here that you haven't done before"
5,Greatest brawling game ever!,"I got this for my birthday and I've loved it every minute. It has several modes for single or multiplayer. There's story mode, tournament mode, and an all-out free-for-all. I would recommend this game to everyone. If you don't have it, IT'S A MUST!ScoreGameplay 8.9Graphics 9.7Overall 9.3"
3,Kinda dull for what I expected...,"Super Smash Bros Brawl is the follow up to SSBM, a game we all loved, but if you're looking for that melee follow up, this game might not be just it. The character selection is okay. There are many unbalanced characters, by the way. (ex. Snake) The melee maps are awesome, but the rest are kinda bland, except for the both zelda ones. The adventure mode is very long and repetitive, and gets boring. Playing with friends is cool and whatnot but this game just doesn't live it up to it's predecessors."
1,Not For Me......,"Super Smash Bros Melee was alot of fun. Now when Brawl came out , i had high hopes. Mostly for the online. Thats where it fails, in a big way. No stats kept, you cant make friends, no records, no rooms to join or special rules to set. Lag is terrible. You have to know someone else with a nintendo to obtain their code and meet them online. Xbox 360 really does it right for online gaming. Im disappointed with this game and would gladly pay a monthly fee for the services Xbox provides. I also find alot of the new maps to be nothing more than frustrating. New characters are good though, but if your new to this series , id stay away. Tried to tell some others about this game. They bought it anyway and are now trying to sell it. Im selling mine too.Oh well."
4,"lives up to the hype, but not for one player","My son had mostly positive things to say about this game. His only negative comment was that once all the levels are unlocked, solo game play is boring. Otherwise, he thought that the game lived up to his expectations for it. (He waited a long time for this game to be released, so long that we almost declared it ""vaporware"".) I can't speak for myself about this game, since the only Wii game I play is Guitar Hero."
5,Super Duper Smash Bros. Brawl for them all.,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!! This game beats Melee with a Smart Bomb! My 7 yr old and 5 yr old did beat the game. They unlocked all the characters and finished the entire Adventure Mode. Don't think it is easy though, I didn't purchase the strategy book because we like to try it out first. We personally didnt need the book, might be helpful to some. Right now I am at 73 percent in the Subspace mode. Great story, great characters (except Olimar) Love Love Love this game. Fantastic! A MUST FOR ANYONE WITH A WII. You have to be crazy not to like this game!"
5,The Best Fighting Game Ever,"Ever since I got this game in 2008 with my Wii it's been SO fun.The adventure mode is fun and challenging and just brawling is really great.Plus, the GameCube Controller compatibility just makes it better.This is one of the best games for Wii and one of Nintendo's finest works.6 out of 5"
3,Fun for all ages,"You're really limited on fun games for the wii, but this one is great. My son who's a teen and a gamer, really likes to play this one with his friends."
5,Mario Bros,My kid loved this game just from scratch. He teached me how to play! He plays with friends for hours!
1,ANOTHER LET DOWN...,"well good things first:1) i loved the controllers which were the most feared aspect of the whole game cause i for my opinion hate the control for the wii.2) improved graphics not much thoughnow the bad things1) online is terrible, i knew this was not going to end good cause its nintendo, they dont know how to make good online games.2) online is going to start to be charged...this came from the president of nintendo. this is probably not going to be as much as xbox but still feels terrible3) single mode was badly planned out4) same as melee5) just a plain dissapointmentif anyone has different opinions, that might be cause the wii has no games. and i OWN ONE. it was the worse 250 dollars i ever spend. all i wanted was paper mario(disapointment as well), and this.i now use my ps3 all the time cause that has great and fun lasting games.sorry nintendo"
3,Nothing new...,"This is a nice book but reveals little in the way of new ideas. If you're looking for nice 'artsy' looking pages & commentaries on various prayer treatments, then you'll enjoy this little book. But if you're really into the meatier aspects of prayer, opt for some other selection..."
5,Fantastic!,A must read for anyone interested in how belief directs our lives. A refreshing change from the money-oriented books about positive thinking.
3,Starting to lose its originality,"Although I loved the first three seasons of QAF, I felt like they were reaching for storylines as the third season closed. Ted becomes such a pathetic loser it's hard to care about him. And shouldn't Michael know Brian well wnough at this point to realize what will piss him off? The sterotypical quality of the characters I can handle (that is to some extent part of their charm), but none of them seem to be maturing much (except maybe Brian). Nonetheless, I will watch every episode (if only to see what t-shirt Debbie is gonna wear next)."
3,Not as good as 1 - 3,"I am grateful to Showtime for making this series. After repeated viewings, this program and its characters are something like a family to me. But there's no disguising the fact that about halfway through Season 4 the action grinds to a halt (I won't reveal why--see it for yourself) and never really picks up again. Let's hope for better next year, the final season."
3,Rather boring,"I love Pat Metheny, but this DVD is very disappointing. While the audio and video are good, the performance, song selection and passive audience make for a dull viewing experience. I saw the Toronto show of this tour and it was way better then what you'll see here."
2,Older Adults Walk & Firm,The quality and colour is poor. It is very hard to see. I was very disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
2,Disappointed,The concept to the necklace was really nice. The poem in it is cute. But the necklace looks cheap. I could have gotten that same necklace from a street vendor for half the price. The cord is way too short and it's way overpriced. I was disappointed totally!
4,okay but not great,"I bought this for my son more as a learning toy than anything else. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem very interested in it. From time to time he carries it around and plays like its his baby (we have a new baby and he likes to imitate us taking care of him) but that's about it. Guess it defers from child to child and the age level."
4,Good learning tool,"Great toy for learning how to button, zip, snap ... and all of the things that can be difficult when using specific fine motor skiils. We bought one for our son and now are giving another to a nephew for his birthday."
4,Good,I bought this to use for Diatomaceous Earth and it does the job pretty good. I thought that it could release more powder that's why I don't give 5 stars. Wolf Creek Ranch is an excellent company. Fast shipping
1,Worthless!,The dvd's won't play at all. I keep an error message. This seems to be an ongoing problem with this product.
1,"LOVE the television show, HATE the dvd!","I wish I could give this product a good rating because I'm actually a fan of the show but I have had nothing but problems when it comes to the dvd. I ordered it and used next day shipping. It arrived on time but much to my disappointment, the dvd would'nt work in my dvd player or in my laptop. I kept getting a disc error message. I returned this item and was sent a replacement which also did'nt work. I sent back the replacement for a second replacement and that one did'nt work as well! Even though Amazon was very accomadating it is very frustrating, to say the least. I realize that this item is manufactured by Amazon but there is no excuse for the product not to work! I returned that second replacement back and was given a refund. It's too bad actually beacause all I really wanted was the dvd. Hopefully this problem will be fixed and I will be able to order this dvd at a later date. Will see."
1,Does this work now?,Would really like to get this DVD for a little Xmas present... does anyone know if the previous problems with the DVD's (described in this thread) are fixed now?
5,Growling Old Men is simply a phenomenal piece of art.,"From the brilliant (and exceedingly clever)album design, to the last strains of ""Goodnight Grampa"", Growling Old Men sparkles with outstanding original material, an irrepressibly western-tinged groove, energetic picking and fine singing. Growling Old Men is one of the most engaging releases I've heard this decade - and you can rest assured I'll be wearing it out here in Nashville"
1,Not a poster!,"This is not a poster. Rather it is a grubby little eight-by-ten that is blown up way beyond what the negative will support. I thought that it would look neat and moody, but rather... it just looks sloppy."
4,Top Gun/Star Wars hybrid,"Not a bad read. Despite some heavy-handed description and dumpy dialog, the flying is aeronautically accurate and exciting. No helmets, tubes or ejections seats, the aircraft are like carpeted control rooms that still act lean and mean. The story has flaws, but the best thing about this book is the way it makes you feel like you're flying through intense stuff -- whether you're ready or not, because it's written in first-person. Parts where the flying is viewed from the ground are extremely well-described. If you like the loud jets at airshows, this book is for you. The book is a mix of G forces and laser weapons, with a philosophical bend later on. Told from the co-pilot's viewpoint, there's lots of imagery as he and his pilot buddy are intensely trained by their mentor."
4,Good value for money,Faced between the choice of a plasma TV and a projector.I purchased the SB-21 from the HP SITEX 2003 Pavilion. Pretty impressive projector.Great size and projection and lamp life. I see a few lines at the bottom of my projected image - will get HP to investigate.Comes with everything needed in the box. Pretty much plug and play. The remote is functional but drains batteries. But I don't use the remote much.
4,Great product,I purchased these to separate items in my freezer and they do exactly what I wanted. Would recommend for freezer organization.
2,Good Ambient No Punch,"I have Recently began reading SR novels after playing shadowrun for the past 4 years. It never accured to me that the novels could introduce something new to my experience, well i was wrong it does add a new side - the not down to earth view. This novel was a bit detached from the day to day struggle of a shadowruner , It gave a different prespective to the SR Janeiro but that's as far as it got.I did enjoyed the high level politics ( Vatican, Secret cults etc' ) and the feeling of the big brother watching you .I kept looking for that down to earth reasoning and all i got was a lot of talk ,speculation and one way blind alley storyline. The matrix descriptions where a bit dry and the hacking itself was boring. I could not relate to the ""heroes"" and the plot got thicker and thicker until the unresolved , unclear and abrupt end of the book that left me unsatisfied .All in all a disappointment."
3,"Good, but it needs better pictures","Most of the pictures in the book werent colored and the colored one were the worst pics of Lucy Lawless I've ever seen. The picture on the cover isn't clear and isn't a picture worth putting on the cover. He should use better pictures. The writing style was a little boring, but it contained good info, except it doesnt explore the friendship between Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor even though in the back it said it does."
4,Informative practical approach,good information on stretching the neck to release tension and getting range of motion. I dont have any neck problems so I can't say the system works. Atleast it's good to know the protocols just in case for future problems or for clients I work with.
5,"neck health, diskectomy and fusion victim . . . .",read this book and use the methods BEFORE surgery. What the doctors DO NOT tell you about diskectomy and fusion surgery is that you will be disabled for life and will never be able to do many activities ever again.The book is excellent for neck mobility and health. Try it as an option before going under the knives. . . .
4,I'm a Fan...,...I enjoy live performances and especially this one. Very good quality picture and sound. If you're a fan you won't be disappointed.
2,RCA burns a hole in your wallet,"The performances on this CD are enlightening and probably deserve a place in every piano-lover's discography. However, save yourself a few bucks and buy the same performances on the budget Naxos label. They're at least as good as the ones found here on RCA, if not better."
2,Almost a waste of time.,"Although Willis' book has many good exercises within its pages, I have a hard time getting past the flagrent misinterpretations within its covers. Willis tries hard to fuse the Grecko/Roman philosophies, and the Astrology that is based on those philosophies, with the mythos and ideals of the Norse, but it just cannot be done successfully. The two philosophies are just too different. He tries to equate Jupiter with Thor. Beside the point that Jupiter was a king of gods and Thor wasn't, Jupiter was feared by his people and Thor was loved and was treated as if he were blood kin.If you are looking for a good book to learn the esoteric meanings of the runes, avoid this book at all costs. ""Northern Mysteries"" by Freyja Aswynn, ""Futhark"" by Edred Thorson, and ""Runecasters"" by Edred Thorson, are far better."
4,"""Dead Like Me"" is Great Entertainment","I love this show! The second season begins to develop Rube's history and continues to follow Georgia's family as they deal with their daily lives. The character development is superb, and the acting is great! The language could be a little cleaner, but this is not a major issue."
3,Good enough,"sutable for its purpose, but not made well. Still I am using it and it was worth its price"
1,Not That Helpful,This is a book of 'technical' presentations of Feng Shui. It lacks the 'how to' of using Feng Shui in our lives. It skips past the meaningful ways to apply all that technical information into practical applications. A waste of money and time... there are much better choices than this book.
4,Ball Heads,"As a novice photographer I found this ball head to be very sturdy and strong. The panning lock was simple, the QC plate is awesome and has an extra safety release on it, the turn dial keeps this ball from moving! I gave it 4 stars cause I would have liked an optical bubble/spirit level ect on the actual ball head base. Now I need a shoe mount level for those tricky landscape shots and horizons @ the beach. All in all an awesome ball head that is not to big nor to small."
4,"Easy to use, attach and snap away.","Had no problem attaching this to the camera or the tripod. The swivel is not quite as smooth as I thought and the weight is a bit too heavy for my wife to carry easily, for those reasons I'm deducting 1 star.Otherwise, this unit works great, the attachment can be left on the camera if you're switching back and forth between holding your shots and using a pod. I don't have an comparative experience but this head seems like a great place to start if you're getting into photography like we are."
4,488RC2 Ball Head - is well made.,"The camera I've been using on the Bogen-Manfrotto 488R C2 Midi Ball Head is the KM Maxxum 7D, along with the KM Battery Pack/Vertical Grip. The Vertical Grip holds two batteries. My largest glass is a Sigma 70mm to 200mm 2.8, and the 488RC2 holds the camer steady.The 488RC2 Ball Head works very good and holds my heavy camera up very well. This product is well made, and I'm happy that I've purchased the 488RC2. I recommend the Bogen-Manfrotto 488RC2 Midi Ball Head.I also purchase the Bogen-Manfrotto 322RC2 Horizontal Grip Action Ball Head, and I find that I personally like this one the best of the two. With the 322RC2 you don't have to tighten down knobs to hold in place. You just squeeze the hand grip and move to the position you want and let go of the grip and then take your photograph."
1,Is this Pepsi pissed out of a God?,"The price is ridiculous. I love Pepsi, but come on. I'm not going to pay $11 for a 12 pack of Pepsi."
2,love the look....but,"I loved this toaster at first. But the cheap plastic lever to make the toast lighter or darker broke and cannot be fixed. Now the bread will not stay down long enough to toast. You have to push it down repeatedly. Granted it is 2 years old, but it seems you shouldn't have to buy a toaster every two years."
1,weak toaster,"This toaster looks nice and is wonderfully inexpensive but is flawed, perhaps fatally. To begin with it toasts slowly, although this might be in initialization matter as ours seemed to speed up a bit over the first couple of weeks. However, ours had a pretty serious mechanical shortcoming, the mechanism that raises and holds the toast was too lightly built to reliably do the job. Ours got stuck terminating the toaster functionality. We have returned the appliance to Amazon and will get another, and it may work longer, but at present this design seems to be nonrobust."
1,Pure Junk,"Pure Junk is the best descriptor. Shoddy workmanship, with trouble from day one. Depressing the down handle would only stay down about half the time.....need to keep depressing. After two months of light use...once a day...the center heating element no longer works. If you want toast on only one side of your bread this is your toaster. Not my mother's Sunbeam for sure. The workmanship we have come to expect from the People's Republic of China is highlighted in this toaster."
1,Theroux the philosopher?,"I will buy (even pre-order) a book by Paul Theroux knowing I will have a page-turner in my hands when I receive it. I found ""Fresh Air Fiend"" incredibly difficult to enjoy. The few straight travel pieces were entertaining. The more superior than thou attitude I read in his writing on Thoreau and others made me ask...who does he think he is? This is one of Theroux's books I would not recommend."
5,'Real' Travel,"Paul Theroux's travel books differ from most travel books;he does not plop the reader down before a grand & famous site to behold it in silent and contemplative wonder. Theroux takes the reader with him on the train ride to the location which can be unbearably uncomfortable, tedious -- and delayed; and often interrupted by unpleasant if interesting men and women. This is travel as it really is not as we would wish it to be. This first-rate writer of fiction and non fiction, compulsively readable, is like the portrait painter whose portraits of the famous include 'warts and all.' Highly recommended."
1,nothing remotely appealing about this book,"To start with, the premise is preposterous that these two women who have no background in police or detective work, no intelligence background or anything that would suit them for this line of work would be recruited to find a missing person. Besides being woefully underqualified to do this work, the way they went about it made little sense and was very unrealistic. I found the constant home repair interludes to be horribly annoying. The characters, both the protagonists and antagonists were poorly drawn out. The twist at the end, including the antagonist's motivation was silly and not remotely believable. All in all a terrible novel.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
5,club hits galore...,"Mark Anthony mixes a pumping mix of peak hour diva anthems and tribal tracks, with disc 2 focusing more on the instrumentals. Time listings are:Disc 11. elements (8:07)2. Your love is taking me over (6:02)3. words that you say (6:47)4. Gotta have hope (7:48)5. Moment of my life (8:17)6. Don't give up (5:50)7. Freaks come out (4:39)8.

3,Iffy book,This book was pretty good when I read it. Sort of a departure from the series when I first read it. If you're familiar with the show then I'd definitely get. Relies a lot on first season characters.
2,Who put this mess together,"Whoever released this album should be fired and shot afterwards for disrespecting da Queen with this b/s! A""greatest hits album"" without anything from the Black Reign album. All i have to say is WTF!"
4,Very good intro in power analysis.,I liked the author's review of power analysis and I have shared it with other people. I was very grateful to Bausell replying back to me with a copy of his software.
3,Not as bad as many would have you believe,"This is Fear Factory's worst album. However, it's not without merit. Call it Nu-metal all you want but What Will become, Invisible Wounds, and especially Linchpin are great tracks. I may have been willing to give this more stars if it weren't for that god awful rap song with Cypress Hill!!! What is up with that!? Hearing Burton C. Bell rap makes my skin crawl! Rap has no place in Metal, and this proves it! It definately can't measure up to Demanufacture or Obsolete, but aside from the horrific rap song it's bout on par with their lates album (Archetype) in my opinion."
1,DIGI - know this album stinks - MORTAL,"What the heck were they thinking? Where are all the killer riffs? I guess in the span of the last few albums, they seem to be showing a softer side, and now they're teaming up with rap artists? WTF? After Demanufacture, it's been downhill the whole trip. Thank goodness they broke up cos it would have been much worse if they had stuck it out. I think if they had released another CD it would have probably had a ballad on it or a duet with Celine Dion or something. I'm glad I listened to it before I wasted my hard earned cash on this worthless piece of junk."
3,Im not sure if I like this or not ....,"Well lets start of with the terrbile absence of musicianship in this band, I dont the guitarist uses more than one string on the whole record. The singer/wannabe growler CANT SING nor can he growl. I do enjoy the technical drum work tho. Its most cirtainly a catchy album, with good use of electronics. Good for a nu-metal album I guess.."
3,Close to very worthy,"3 1/2Zorn's Masada output may be overdone, as there are other entries that would serve better to introduce one to the avant-garde saxophonist's heavy duty jewish renditions on traditional themes, but aside for a few squelching throwaways, volume three stands as a solid entry in the 10+ set."
4,Wings over Nantucket...,"This show takes me back to my adolescent days when i was cynical about everything, but through it all one thing remained, my love for wings.I never missed a week. To me it was far better than Friends which i never really cared for. Through the seasons a love story developed between Joe and Helen and she nearly married another but Joe came to the rescue and made a last minute stand to reclaim the woman he so dearly loved, it was great. Cant wait for the remaining seasons to come out, this and ""Caroline in the city"", another one of my favs."
5,Wings complete Third Season,Wings was a favorite of mine in the past and it was nice to find this season on Amazon.com at a reasonable price.
1,Self-indulgent ramblings,"Nicely packaged and attractive speaks well for the publisher, but this book could have used a good editor. Author has written a very self-indulgent, rambling book filled with trivia, but often losing sight of the Mexican Revolution and Pancho Villa. More disappointing, most of the photos in the book have been published numerous times, which is surprising since the author claims to have examined photo archives all over the US! In fact, 70% of the photos in this book come from El Paso/Las Cruces sources--and some of them have nothing to do with the revolution--they were just interesting for the author, so he included them! I'm surprised the book was published in this form and written this way, but it will not sell well outside its target audience in El Paso."
4,A Pictoral and Micro-history,"If you like micro-history, you'll enjoy this book. Rather than dealing with the big events of the day, Romo tells his stories with the details of the day.... details that, put together, make a much larger story. The book is a series of readable essays that are fascinating to those who have an interest in immigration, Pancho Villa, the border and the Mexican Revolution. The pictures alone are worth the price of the book! I recommend it to all students of American and Mexican history."
4,"Ring Dang Do and a Woo, Woo, Woo!","Let's start with the major fact that this is a weird book, only Bill Rackoszy has published such jumbles.Villa Raids Columbus, New Mexico March 9, 1916This not to say either is not worth reading, they are. Just turn on your BS sensor.This is a pastiche of photos, extracts from the newspapers, interviews, whatever.The other reviewers have gotten into details of content. No need to reiterate all that. I just think some missed the point and others were overwhelmedIf you compare this with a dinner, it is not a homoginous, glutinous meatloaf, but a many course Chinese meal,with the ingredients, all served simultaneously, chopped up, and stirred around, all the ingredients still recognizable. Some ingredients are substantial, some are minimal but they are always recognizable.From the trivial to the significant, the various parts make up an interesting read.And the book certainly deserves a place in my collection of personal narratives and reportage.Well done. :{)>"
5,Here's the handbook on writing we've been looking for ...,"A big thumbs up on this one! I finally found a book on screenwriting that is funny, easy to follow and not bogged down in academic jargon. I just read this in one sitting. D.B. Gilles's simple approach to writing takes the fear out of facing a project, and believe me, I've read plenty of these books. If I sell a screenplay NOW, I'll know who to thank. Hit 1-click and buy this book!"
4,Great gift,I bought this for the a friend of mine for her b-day and it came quickly and in great shape and it was appreciated.
1,insular academic chatter,"I was assigned this as a text for a college class, which I subsequently dropped after reading the book. What I had wanted was a basic introduction to the concepts of the science of ecology. What I got instead was unnecessary academic references and page after page of statistical methodology. These might be important in a graduate class or a professional journal, but they are woefully out of place in an introductory textbook. This book is a perfect example of what is wrong with the modern technocratic university: overspecialized PhDs, preoccupied with methodology, writing for each other, and unable to communicate with anyone outside their disciplines. It is a lousy tool for teaching and learning. If I were you I'd run screaming."
5,A memory relived (and I was born in 1980!),"OK, so I wasn't alive to see ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" air originally, but growing up (I think it was around 1994 or so) I saw some replays on Nick At Night. The show really clicked with me. It was a really enjoyable show. It hasn't aired for a long time now, even in syndication (that I came across), so when I heard about the DVDs, I couldn't wait! Watching now, it's like the show is an earlier version of Saved by the Bell...don't take that as a negative. The video on the DVDs for WBK is clear as can be. I can't wait to get more of this series."
5,Welcome Back Kotter - The First Season,What a wonderful show this was - made big stars of John Travolta and Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (who went on to star in Mod Squad). It was funny then and it still is funny today. The cast is marvelous. I loved it back then and even more now. Good CLEAN comedy. This is a very good quality dvd and I highly recommend it to everyone. I can hardly wait for the other seasons to come out on dvd.
2,It's just not funny,"Up your nose, with a rubber hose? Ugh. I Netflixed disc one and found the experience jarring; in a bad way. I still like Gabe, still like that old theme song, actually liked the retrospective, but the rest is so... unfunny. The sweathogs themselves are so over the top, unnatural, and abrasive I thank God I didn't buy the set on day one which I almost had. Almost.My shelves are chock full of 70's shows, Starsky and Hutch, CHiPs, Bradys, and Columbo, but this show I feel is a product of its time that has no place here with us now."
5,amazon is amazing,"Again, Amazon.com is amazing. They have just what you want, always at a fair price and shipped quickly and very well packaged. If there were six stars, I would award them to Amazon."
1,cookware,You get what you pay for . This set is not expensive. I real cook would be upgrading very soon .These will not hold up very long for a pearson that would use them everyday. They are not heavy and won't give best results.
5,MatthewB,"This is indeed an exceptional film - despite the filming camera obviously being hand-held for some shots - it doesn't distract from the content at all.My wife and I found the film an enthralling yet simple story about a monk, once sworn to silence, receiving permission to speak, and briefly rejoin society to save their monestary in Switzerland because the lease is about to expire.A classic case of content defeating special effects, violence and crude behavior. If you're serious about assembling a good video library, this film would be a component. I can't believe it's not in the Criterion collection and on DVD."
5,Ann Margret is still somethingto watch!,"I waited so long to see this film, finally it opened here in New York City and I rushed to see it! Had a hard time at first following the plot, but slowly it all came together, especially after veteran actress Ann- Margret comes on screen as Carol Hargrave. I have never seen Ann Margret in this type of role and she really does a great job! REally love the film, the DVD has some great extras for aspiring film makers too!"
4,"Another approach to discover the true nature of ""work""","Often we read passages from how-to books which do not consider the true depth of enlightenment in the workplace. Marsha Sinetar in her book, does not try to prescribe a sollution yet rather lets the reader think outloud about the potential that is awaiting us in a place of Positive relection at the workplace.I found her approach refreshing and on the mark, her open ended questions are helpful and realistic. Less puffery than other ""spiritual books"""
1,not original songs,"Very simple- if you like a song and want to hear it, why download some garbage re-recording? Listen before you buy."
5,Laughing together was great!!,"I purchased Tim Hawkin's DVD, Rock Show Comedy Tour, for one of our grown sons this Christmas. There were 14 of us gathered at another son's home. After all the presents were opened, we played Tim's DVD. It was great! The house began to fill with laughter, from grandma and grandpa down to the younger grandchildren. Laughter was one of the gifts from God that we enjoyed together this year. Thanks Tim, for making us laugh!!"
2,Romer is Out to Lunch,"It is obvious that Romer sets out to discredit the Bible! When atheists and non-Christians try to do this to persuade others, they often don't oppose everything but oppose key events or try to diminish their importance. This is the tactic that Romer is using! Because he can't prove something happened, it doesn't mean it didn't happen... it simply means his investigation is lacking! I would not recommend this series to any serious Christian!!! Very disappointed. I seriously wonder if Romer is a Christian... I'm betting he isn't!!! What is interesting is if you Google ""Is John Romer an atheist?"" you will find many references by atheists who like Romer's Testament. This is all the info I need to know. To me when someone tries to discredit the Word of God, they are trying to put themselves above God. Didn't Lucifer try this???"
4,A feast for your ears&#65533;,"The songwriting, performance, engineering, production, and mastering on this CD are spectacular. Other than that, it's okay. ""Liar's Nightmare"" has quickly become one of my favorite ""story"" songs, although the story is almost impossible to follow. Suffice to say that it pulls you along with both lyric, dynamics, production, and intensity. Highly recommended for any fans of actual music rather than the drek that sells like hotcakes today."
5,permanent twilight,"I normally resist reading any form of fiction but this topic, homeless youth, was of particular interest to me. I work as a principal in a school for delinquent children. This novel captured the essence of at-risk kids. After the first 50 pages it totally engaged me and I read it intently through its end.I purchased multiple copies for family, friends and collegues. They in turn found it absorbing. In this era of [too often] faceless, unimagninative and cookie cutter publishing, we found Chuck Freadhoff's work insightful, inspiring and unique. Treat yourself as well to his spendid work. You will not be disappointed."
5,My hubby likes them,I ordered these for my husband and he likes them! I was hesitant to order them on-line- but took the chance and they fit great and look great! Thanks!
4,Great product - does what it says at a great price,"Set up of this product was a breaze - connected to components under a 37"" LCD and an outside window about 5 feet away. I placed the receiver eye underneath the center channel speaker out of view of the TV and pointing away from the window, made the connections and viola! Everything is in the cabinet with doors closed and the remote works from across the room.The cable of transmitters is bulky and hard to organize in the cabinet. It looks a little messy in the cabinet, but hey, the doors stay closed. I'm not crazy about the little sticky pads on my components, but I will deal with that later.I am very pleased - this product was much cheaper than similar products offered. I highly recommend."
4,Very Happy,"I bought this to replace and existing unit I was unhappy with, especially the sensor. The old unit is one that is very popular on Amazon.This was a much more sleek package than I previously used, and as such, you give up some flexibility--such as using IR jacks in the back of components. But the sensor and the blue led signal light are both so great that it is a big improvement. The reason I gave construction 4 stars is that the emitters always end up losing their stickiness. But that is true with all of these.Great buy, very happy."
5,Hot Link Pro is exactly what I needed,"I was installing a new LED TV in our bedroom, and wanted to mount it on the wall while putting all my equipment (Cable box, Blue Ray player, etc.) in the closet. I needed some way to make the remote control function with all my stuff behind the closed doors of the closet.Hot Link Pro Remote Control Booster Systemis just the ticket! It was very easy to set up! It took less than 10 minutes from taking it out of the box to fully functional! It comes with enough connections for 6 different pieces of equipment, and it has a blue LED light that flashes to let you know it's working. I couldn't have asked for anything better!! I would recommend this to anyone who needs to put their A/V equipment in another part of the house away from the TV. It works GREAT!!!"
5,Solved all of my problems,"I have my equipment in another room aproximately 25 feet behind my main viewing area. I have tried everything I could think of to reliably control the equipment remotely. X10 Powermids. Harmony and Universal RF remotes. Next Gen RF ""saucer"". All worked to varying degrees but never 100% reliably. There was always the looming doubt that a button press actually worked (and a lot of times it didn't) or the frustrating multiple registered button press. All this is now a thing of the past. The Hot Link Pro works the first time, every time. Now I can just sit back and enjoy the movie!"
5,An excellent product that does exactly what it supposed to do,The product is by far the best and least expensive item I have found of its type. It is easy to install and has worked flawlessly. I called the customer service line to confirm a feature and was answered immediately by a pleasant person who took care of my inquiry in seconds. I recommend it without reservation.
1,Did not work with Sony 52' XBR Bravia,"I purchased this product based upon the reviews. After installation with my equipment in a closet behind a 52"" Sony Bravia XBR everything worked well...until I turn on the TV. The IR receiver becomes completely jammed with spurious IR from the television. Adjusting the location of the eye does not help. It might work in one location during the evening but during the day it does not. It's basically a complete waste of money if you have a late model large LCD screen.I'm an electrical engineer, and why it does not come with an IR noise filter is beyond me. It seems that the design is too sensitive to be useful with large LCD or plasma screens which are known to radiate IR."
4,Hot Link Pro Remote Control Booster System,"I rate the system as excellent. I might rate it as outstanding if I were familiar with all other systems that perform the same purpose. I have an extensive Audio/visual system and have found that universal remotes cannot fill all my needs or that adjustment/tuning is always in doubt. On the other hand, you have to get up and open your cabinet to have direct visual contact with whatever system(s) you want to use. The Hot Lint Pro system takes all those issues away and with all the necessary remotes at hand I am able to use any part or combinations of my system with ease and reliability. It is remarkably easy to install and is not obvious to the eye. This is a system that simplifies and is unobtrusive."
5,Best Conditioner,"I have tried so many conditioners and been let down but this one is the best. If you have ever colored your hair at home with one of those cheep at home color kits I'm sure you will remember the very small sample conditioner they had in the box...How can you forget it, it was the best conditioner, the ""your hair has never felt so soft before"" type. And then you wish that someone would bottle it to use every day. Well...This is that bottle! My hair has NEVER felt so touchably soft like this EVER before. I just love it!"
1,Tamagotchis don't take over the world!,"Sorry but I don't like this toy at all. I don't think it's worth more than one star.And these toys don't take over the world. Most of my friends have not got a tamagotchi.And I had a tamagotchi-three tamagotchis and I found out that becoming obsessed with a little virtual pet is no fun.And,not every kid is taking a tamagotchi in their home. That's just silly. I can't stand toys which you can't switch off. And I totally disagree with anyone who says,""Tamagotchis will take over the world."""
1,Boy that sucked,"No back story, interesting premise but very poorly handled. Didn't make a lot of sense even if you do manage to stay awake for the ending. I rarely give a review but thought everyone needed warned off...."
2,THAT'S MY BLANKET!,"This was a well made low budget film that I didn't like. Civilization has suddenly collapsed for some unexplained reason as people distrust and kill each other (""Yellow Brick Road""). A family of four decide to leave the city for Dover's Bend, their old home town. That is pretty much it.Along the way they encounter other people and a hear weird noises and feel spooked out. The mystery, which you may not realize there is one, is solved at the end.The acting was decent for a low budget. The writing and direction were also better than normal, it just that there wasn't anything there to enjoy. They didn't build character well. The ""twist"" was not unexpected. For seasoned film watchers this is a let down. People who don't watch a lot of horror films might find some enjoyment in it.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
2,Stupid,"Waste of money on this movie. The title doesn't fit the movie at all! This movie will put you to sleep, and that is why I shut it down."
2,typical teenage angst,"not the worst movie in terms of acting, atmosphere but it just has typical quirky characters with pretty awful dialogue at times- seems like it was written by a 16 year old with all the standard angsty self discovery thoughts and ideas about what the world should be. The main character was pretty annoying. Reminded me of an Almost Famous type movie with out any of the good dialogue, endearing characters, genuine plot line, authentic emotions, etc"
1,Poor workmanship,"I was advised to get this backpack by my physical therapist, to help me with some back problems I'd been having. I initially winced at the price but decided my health was worth it.However, I honestly can't say I noticed a very large difference using this backpack as opposed to any of the others I have had, in terms of back discomfort. What I *did* notice was that the backpack was poorly made. After less than a year of light-to-medium use, many of the zippers began to fail. Some I was able to ""fix"" using pliers to crimp them back onto the teeth, but once the stitching on the main pocket zipper pulled away from the backpack fabric itself, I gave up.Maybe that's a typical lifespan for an ergonomic backpack, but my LL Bean bags were so durable I often wound up getting rid of them after 5 years when I got sick of them, rather than because they broke."
2,Not Van Cliburn's best,"While the Van Cliburn recording of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2 (coupled with either Beethoven No. 5 or Tchaikovsky No. 1) is a classic performance of that piece, this disc falls short. The live recording is muddled and poorly mixed, and the piano is lost among the rest of the orchestra in parts. In addition, Cliburn is not at his best, missing notes and seemingly off in his pacing. The Prokofiev is a decent enough recording, but there are better versions of the Rachmaninoff No. 3 available (e.g. Ashkenazy, complete set of 1-4 on the Decca double) to make this disc no better than a supplemental recording for an otherwise complete collection."
3,A carseat or a throne?,I bought this seat after two certified carseat technicians told me how great it was to have the 5 pt harness up to 80 lbs. I have a brand new 2008 GMC vehicle and this seat was way too big for it! My child looked like she was sitting on a throne. I had difficulty getting it out of the box it was so enormous. It is huge. I returned it and bought a Britax Marathon that has the 5 pt harness up to 65 lbs instead. I'd recommend trying out the Regent in person in your car and on your child before buying this one for sure.
2,VERY BIG Seat,"This seat is HUGE and we had to return it (costing is about $100 w/ a restocking fee, the shipping cost and the vendor changed us for the cost of outbound shipping too). We have a BMW X5 (SUV) and this seat was way to big. We have a Marathon and love it. We choose to wait a bit for the frontier to come out and love that one! It seat is nice but very large and very heavy!"
3,I WORK W/ CAR SEATS EVERYDAY,"I'm not here to bash Britax car seats they are agreat seat, however you don't get 100 to 150 dollars more seat with a Britex than lets say Cosco's Safety 1st, Alpha Omega & Eddie Bauer all which have a warranty of 7 yrs compared to Britax's 1 yr, Graco 65's also are as good for less money and have a 1 yr warranty. All Evenflo's have a 90 day warranty , but make some good seat to. I'm certified to install saftey seats and I'm always amazed at people who think Britax is THE best option, you should also consider cost and warranties and most important are they a good seat . The ones I mentioned are as frunctional safety wise as Britax."
4,A Monstrosity!,"This car seat fills a need- for a child bigger than 40 pounds who won't sit in a booster. However, this is the biggest car seat I have ever seen! We call it my son's ""throne.""I drive an SUV, and this seat barely fits. It must be positioned behind the driver, because otherwise it obstructs vision and creates a HUGE blind spot. If you are used to Britax seats (all are fairly tall) then this is not too much higher, but it is very broad at the top.My son thinks it is very comfortable and he has a lot of growing room."
1,Deceiving Title for a poor film,"Imagine my surprise when I learned that ""The Stranger Beside Me"" is NOT a film version of the gripping biography of Ann Rule's shocking discovery that her friend Ted Bundy was the serial murderer they had been investigating! Rather, it is a typically lame, uninspired and hackneyed ""Lifestyle television event,"" that is to say, television for women who like to fantasize that men are all closet voyeurs, stalkers, rapists and murderers. Though I agree the acting was acceptable, the film falls into so many ""Lifestyle Network"" stereotypes that you can see the complete film after watching about 20 minutes of it. This film is strictly for the women who fall into the category I've already mentioned."
2,"90s drama, but it looks like 70s or 80s","It is a usual drama, but the way or how the movie looks like is very old! I don't know what kind of cameras and cinema tools were used or my DVD is awful?The movie is based on a true story crime drama. Directly you will be able to identify the criminal. There are some adults scene ""sexual"".Out of ten I will give it four only."
5,Awesome,"I bought this for my friend teenager and she loves it, Now she can understand on a level of her own, it's also great for adults especially if you have a difficult time understanding the King James Version. As with everything Pray to the Lord for understanding."
2,Extraneous info...myriad typos,"This book has a lot of information in it, but the extraneous matter shifts your focus away from the important stuff that's actually covered on the test. The practice tests in the book in no way reflect the real ones. Worst of all, there are countless mistakes, typos, and missing answers. Don't buy this book."
5,Great Guinea Pig food,"I got this guinea pig food when I first got my guinea pig. My guinea pig eats it all and enjoys it. It contains healthy foods such as dried corn and oats. I enjoy buying it for my guinea pig as it is healthy, cheap and my guinea pig loves it. Additionally it comes in a reseal able bag, which is very convenient. I was very satisfied with this food as well as my Guinea pig was."
3,An interesting Read..,"It's like a manga (comic book) in the way that the story is told through pictures and very little words. It's interesting, but kinda leaves you thinking WTF?"
3,Ok!,"In terms of quality, I would rate it as 'good', its thickness is appropriate, average. The only negative aspect about this is that after almost 2 weeks it started being uneven: there is a like a bump that slightly curves and that makes part of the pad not lay straight on the desk. It's not very noticable, only to the one using it. But since this is not a leather pad, and for its price, it's good."
4,Nice size and quality,Nice size and quality for the price - wish it came in burgundy but the black is also nice.
1,The Same Old Same Old,"In a word: boring. Nothing new in the field of Mariology. Just a rehash of old prayers in a new binding. You can find the same thing on the Internet is you type in ""Prayers to Mary."""
1,You might be disappointed with this book....,"I enjoy Oswald Chambers and typically review his books very highly (My Utmost for His Highest, Studies on the Sermon on the Mount) but was disappointed with this particular book.I eagerly purchased ""Prayer"" expecting to sit at the feet of this great man and listen to his wisdom on the topic. Instead, I found a compilation of what is contained in his other books - cut-and-pasted together in such a way as to frustrate the reader.Sad to say,this book is simply a crude attempt to ""remarket"" Chamber's other works. The student of Chambers will be enormously more pleased to purchase a volume of his other books like: Utmost, Baffled to Fight Better, Christian Discipline, Sermon on the Mount, or many others, all based on his singular teachings and collected by his widow.If you buy and read his great books, you will have no need to buy this compilation."
3,I must be getting old,"I must be getting old. Why would I choose to read this book? But I did. Not only that! I recognize all the people it refers to and the comments about the works of GO strike me as just the sort of reaction I would have myself! It makes me want to know how old Harold Bloom is. Perhaps I am becoming too familiar with Harold Bloom and I am beginning to think as he teaches me! If so, who are the THOUGHT POLICE? Harold?This is Orwell reconsidered and it rings true. It even has me thinking about reading some of GO's things again."
2,Slow and disappointing,"Unlike Keith Ablow's other books, this one really stank. Normally his books are page turning thrillers but this one was completely the opposite. This book is 447 pages long and it could have easily been 250 pages instead. There's no suspense or guess work in this book. If you like the Frank Clevenger series, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. Overall, I thought it to be a slow and disappointing read, but it won't deter me from reading other books by Keith Ablow. This one is not recommended"
4,"good , but ....","although the killer is known early on , it's the interplay between clevenger and his adopted son,billyas well as his on and off relationship with his woman friendthe book ends with 2 or three unanswered questionsa bit short , but kept me in suspensehope there is a 7th clevenger novel in the works , it's been at least 5 years or more since this book was publishedmr ablow can teach mr kellerman and white how to keep their books within a set number of pages"
4,Engaging,"I read this book over the course of two days and found it engaging and interesting. Clevenger is as big a mess as some of the guys he chases. Moreover, his son Billy is so heinous and irredeemable a character that the reader doesn't care what happens to him.West Crosse is both fascinating and a bit too stereotypical of a serial killer just doing what he does out of religious fervor."
5,One of the best Disney movies,This is one of the best Disney movies I have watched. I had the movie on video and when I saw it was available on DVD - it was a must. My grandchildren also enjoy the movie.
3,Meh,"As a Zelda fan, I had to get this on principle. It's basically a walkthrough of the game in somewhat of a novelization form. Not great, but I had to have it. ;)"
5,I am satisfied to meet again,"This book is very famous, although just hearing the name Bathe as a writer.Once more I buy this book as a new version."
2,Too expensive.,"I bought series 1,3, and 4 before Christmas 2009 for $41.99 each from Amazon. Now I see it's going for $65 a piece. What's going on??? I love this show, maybe it's worth $62, but come on guys, give us a break. Don't take advantage of the situation by increasing the price, you might loose some fans out there who are not willing to fork out that much dough!"
1,Repeat of all other Dr. Who's,"Dr. Who themes, stories, and even the type of actors are all almost carbon copies of Of prior episodes. If you've seen a few, in any season, you've seen them all. Boring, no surprises. Terrible stories, horrible acting, bland comedy. And I'm dumb for thinking this one might b different."
4,YEAHH,"While not as good as the first two series, the third series of Doctor Who still provides an awesome fix for all Who addicts. I can't say I enjoyed it as much simply because I am a devoted Doctor/Rose shipper and the Martha line just didn't work for me like Rose did. David Tennant is a knockout in his second series as the Doctor - he alone makes the series worth watching.The beginning of the series, starts weakly, almost cliched; however, the series quickly gains ground and ends on a strong note leaving viewers panting for the next series - in which Rose returns YEAH! It is a shame that we won't be able to view it in the States until the DVDs come out November next.Over all, the third series is definitely worth purchasing and is a worthy addition to the life of any Whovian. Long live the 10th Doctor!"
5,For Blink Alone,One episode makes this entire series worth the buy. Blink. Episode 10. Beware the weeping angels. I've watched Doctor Who since 1979. This episode surpasses the City of Death. Who would ever thought the best episode of this forty-plus year-old sci fi series would come this late? Get it.
2,Absolute dismal - what a disappointment after Rose,"I just watched the first three seasons back to back. Seasons 1 and 2 were absolutely superb. What a wonderful duo the Doctor and Rose were. Then came season three. What happened? Terrible writing, plotless episodes, waaaaay too much political correctness and, what's the black girl's name (seriously, she's so bland, I can't even remember).Hopefully Season 4 will be better. Because if not, Doctor Who lost me as a lifelong fan."
4,Dont Blink,"This season as the episode ""BLINK"" that alone is enough to buy it.Even if you arent a WHO fan..this episode should be watched. it is a ""Doctor light"" episode..but the pacing is phenomenal! Favorite episode thus far!"
5,Doctor Who Series 3,"If you are a Doctor Who fan, then this is a must have for your collection. I'm glad I got this DVD set. It's packed full of fun stuff like the Doctor Who confidentional concert, deleted scenes (including the very funny ""I hate pears"" One, David Tennent's video diarys, and other inside looks into how the show is made. The third season is a very fun season to watch as it had quite a few great storys, such as the two parter where the Doctor becomes human and also the three parter with the Master. The third season is also where we first meet the creepy villians, the weeping angles and the doctor's campanion, Martha Jones. I most defenatly recomend buying this season."
1,unfortunately,"Cannot write a review of this as it was a gift for someone who likes Mystery movies - for me, I would not watch it. The recipient of the movie pack, a real Mystery movie enthusiast, unfortunately was run over by a car before I was able to give it to him as a gift. I could not get a refund on what I paid. Unfortunately."
4,People movie,"A nice movie about a old man and his family, and fairly decent script. Ed Asner makes the thing believable."
4,Enjoyable!,This was a new author for me and I very much enjoyed the book. It was light and funny and what I call a pretty fast read. I would certainly read more of the authors books
4,I would have added an extra star but...,"I liked this book, I loved the mystical Moon Goddess/Dream Man relationship. I did take exception to one aspect that was jarringly wrong. An administrative school official seemed awfully unconcerned about the sale and distribution of drugs to her school kids. She was aware of drug sales and specifically who was doing the selling, and did not report it to anyone, she just let it go. This seemed to make drugs in the schools an insignificant occurrence. It would not have brought the cuteness of the storyline down to have taken this seriously and taken some action although it may have affected part of the action later in the story (although with all those inter-related country-folk, maybe not).Other than that, this was a charming, light-hearted story with a whisper of the paranormal and mysticism that I found delightful."
4,Suspends Reality,"I like Dana Taylor's ability to create that alternate world we sometimes want to live in when our own requires a short escape. And it takes a suspension of reality to believe the premise upon which the story is based.SPOILER ALERT: Don't read this paragraph if you want to be surprised. SPOILER ALERTI can believe that a guy goes out in the middle of the night to let off steam. I can also believe that a woman, comfortable and secure on her isolated property, feels uninhibited enough to sleep outdoors--especially under the influence of wine. It's what takes place after that, that I can't believe.That said, I enjoyed the characters, dialogue, and the setting. I would read more of Dana Taylor's books but, I'll know that sometimes, romance doesn't always give us reality. H-m-m, maybe reality isn't all it's cracked up to be..."
4,LOVED half of it!,"I LOVE the Golden Age DVD series but I was very disappointed with the first 2 programs on this DVD. Let It Rain was really boring and the acting was mediocre and dull. Feather Top was so silly that I only watched about 5 minutes of it. Then came the wonderful programs that made this DVD well worth buying. The Golden Key was a wonderful bitter sweet story about a man who is down on his luck. Joe E. Brown played this part to perfection and you will weep for him and cheer for his successes. The Honest Man is a treasure with Jack Benny at his best starring with Charles Bronson and Zsa Zsa Gabor. He has to be the funniest ""honest"" man you've ever seen. The only thing missing here is Rochester! You won't regret buying this DVD after you've seen the last 2 programs!"
5,Italian organ music recorded live on historic organs.,"David Litwin identified six organs in Italy built from 1471 to 1825 and recently restored. He arranged for local organists to play music that might have been played on each organ when it was new, and recorded from one recording station situated where a listener might sit. The result is a recording that makes you feel as if you're in the church where the organ is located. The music selections are interesting and upbeat, not the funereal tones we too often associate with the organ. And since it's all local music, it's not so familiar as the Bach organ music we all know and love. A good listen."
2,Suzie Martin,"Decided to buy this at a bargain bin price. Obviously low budget with very cheesy makeup for the ""zombies"". The best part of the movie, I must say, is young, very sexy Suzie Martin...too bad she did not act in future movies; she could have been a screem queen."
2,Broke cable first time out,"First time using spreader the cable that operates the orafice opening broke. It broke where it connects to the handle.Back to using my cheap weed-eater spreader for my salt, at least its still going after three years."
2,"Woodward could make anything dull, and does","We can see where Woodward's interests lie, since Clinton takes up more pages by himself than the rest put together. This should be an interesting, readable book, but nothing will be make Woodward's style tolerable. He is duller than ever, and the book is a chore. He needs a ghost, but quick. A good case is made for the special prosecutor's office as running amok, but no one comes off well, which is the case with too much scrutiny. The legacy of Watergate? We know entirely too much about politicians."
3,Insightful and Challenging,"I guess I wanted to read more reasons to not like Republican presidents and I expected Bob Woodward to provide that for me. What I really encountered was a balanced, insightful book that made me see events through clearer, more objective prose than I may have expected.Contrary to other reviews, I was more enthralled with the perspectives of the Nixon-Bush era and really, I guess, just too darned tired of the Clinton stuff to do anything more than just read away.Certainly readable and balanced. An exceptionally talented author."
3,Facts or fiction ?,"If I want to read great fiction I'll order a copy of ""The Triumph and the Glory""! How many of Woodward's depicted conversations actually took place ? How do we know these quotes he relies so heavily upon to spice up his books aren't manufactured out of whole cloth ? We don't."
3,HERE WE GO AGAIN . . .,"Woodward is a good writer and he tells the truth, but when you have heard it all before, it's not interesting. Really, for those of us who followed the Lewinsky/Clinton fiasco, there is nothing new in this book. Woodward's treatment of the other presidents here is more interesting."
1,leaks,"Second one I bought, and they both leak out of the flower pedals. Annoying, because it draws ants when they leak. Poor product. Just wish I would have kept the box so I could have returned it. Live, and learn."
1,Leaking feeder,The feeder is the perfect size. It immediately attracted hummingbirds and I thought they were drinking like crazy since I had to fill it almost every day. Turns out it was leaking through the flowers drip by drip. I'm now looking for another feeder.
1,The birds love it - but it leaks,"Both new Feeders leaked!!! I needed to update this review. Obviously there is a manufacturing problem with the feeders and they are not sealed on the bottom. The first one leaked right away. The second one started leaking after about a week. We are trying to glue the bottoms ourselves as the birds do like this feeder a lot, but if it doesn't work they will both have to be returned.We had one of this model feeder, and another one from the same company that holds more liquid. The birds would eat out of this one twice as fast. I think it's the way the feeding portion is so close to the bottom. I think they can get more food out of it faster."
2,Disappointed,"The item came with no instructions on how to assemble it. A plastic coated wire was inside the container, which I guessed was to hang the feeder, but it was inadequate. The perch fit the bottom but did not attach....was loose and didn't stay put. I put the feeder together with the aid of super glue and some duct tape, and used picture hanging wire to hang the feeder. I would not recommend anyone buying this item. You can get one assembled already at Walmart."
1,Disapointed,"I purchased this product for the treatment of arthritis in my hands and wrists. This particular paraffin bath has a very unpredictale temperature control. It gets too hot to use, and when turned down to the minimum heat setting, the wax films over and a dark color or particulate forms in the bottom of the tub. I am quite displeased with this one and am lokking for a better quality wax bath. Don't waste your $$ on this cheap one.Cheryl-IA"
4,Not indispensable,"This CD contains a live performance of ""Poppy Nogood and his Phantom Band"" also appearing on ""Rainbow in a curved air"".Excellent and long as the performance is (young Riley is already at the peak of his powers), it isn't sufficiently different to warrant the purchase of the CD unless, like me, you are a confirmed Riley junkie."
3,ALRIGHT,I am sorry I just did not too much care for this book at all. The characters and the twist at the end is crazy enough but it was just some aspects of the book that was just too unbelievable to even imagine it. It was a decent read but I would not recommend a person to get it.
2,Zenda 2,"I never received this book, I was given a refund, reordered it and never received the second order!"
2,A different sound of Amahl,"Although this album was brilliant, I am used to an Amalh album that I have had in my possession for many years. This album that was conducted by Herbert Grossman was amazing. It was done in Dec. 1963 by the NBC Opera Company. Please let me know if anyone else has heard this particular album. I have been trying desperatly to find another, and havent had any luck. The mother was Martha King and Amahl was Yaghjian. j_silvestri70@yahoo.com"
5,Mark Harmon,"Saw it in TV and knew I had to have it. Have most of his movies. Great actor not important what he's doing, comes out great."
3,An okay movie,Mark Harmon before NCIS. It was not the most facinating movie. It may have been made for Lifetime Movies. But it was intertaining enough for afternoon intertainment.
4,pretty good,I found this book good for someone just starting out. I have been working with my 6 year old daughter with this book and she likes it and is doing remarkably well. Great for adults and with a little help kids as well.
3,howto,"I'm in the process of teaching myself to draw/paint and striving for more creativity and find this book helpful in that it has instructions for drawing what you see. Even though it is helping me with drawing basics, its presentation is flat and sort of uninspiring, perhaps because there is no color in it and the pictures tend to be somewhat traditional and staid. I find myself wanting to say to the author, ""Thanks; I'll try that; it should help me draw...but could you break out, dance around a bit or something?"""
4,My son loves it and have been watching again and again,"Not only my son loves to watch the 4 movies comes with this DVD, My wife and I enjoyed watching too. Jackes has always been the kind of animated series not only enjoyable to kids but also to adults.The reason I gave it 4 stars is that every story seems just a little too short for me."
3,Pretty good book...maybe four stars!!!!,"First off, I am in the process of reading over sixty Dragonlance novels in chronological order, so click on my name for great and humourous reviews...true also! Now to this book...I almost gave this book four stars, it's that good. Ten stories in all and half of them are great! The other half are boring, but if they are boring they at least have a decent story. The action is the boring part and in some stories questions are left unanswered, by an author's mistake. The love stories in a few of these are some of the best! Raistlin's Daughter is a enjoyable story, but as you will find out in later books the story is completely (BLANK)! Not gonna spoil it! May be one of the best Tales books because it has the most good stories. Read this!"
2,Too Flimsy!,These look deceivingly sturdy. They are not. They are made of flimsy plastic and they don't stay together when assembled. Not at all what I was looking for. The colors are nice.
3,if color matters . . .,"If you are attracted by the colors of the boxes, please note that the box that appears rose colored in the photo is really purple, and the one that appears pale periwinkle is really sky blue. The other colors are pretty accurate."
3,"Good writing, but I am disappointed","I must say first that she is an excellent writer. That's what attracted me to ""tender at the bone"" in the first place. However, I am very disappointed by her account of immaturity, selfishness, infidelities and betrayal to her first husband. I feel sorry for him. Furthermore her affair with e.g. Colman is not really based on love or passion. I got the impression it was because of Colman's flashy manner and power and fame. She was candid though for writing all this stuff in the book. ""Tender at the bone"" however is much innocent, pure and leaves you with a good taste. Stop at the ""tender at the bone"" if you want to have a good memory of the author."
3,Love the bit about the food,"I must say that I throughly enjoyed reading about what she was eating and the places that she went to, but just way too much information. I haven't read her other autobiography, but it sounds much more enjoyable than this one. I really didn't want to hear about her troubled married life and all her infidelities. But overall, she has great descriptions of food!!"
2,"All in all, a disappointment.","I found the parts of the book that stuck to the descriptions of locales and their cuisines to be enjoyable, but it seemed the reader was too frequently dragged back into listening to Ms. Reichl's tales about the fortunes - or misfortunes - of her love life. Of the 300 pages it seemed like more than half were devoted to her personal travails. Hopefully the next time she will favor us with more insights into the world of restaurants and the creation of American cuisine."
4,Writes with an open heart,"Although Ruth has encounted her share of life's obstacles and heartache, she continues to embrace life with a sense of humor, and an open heart, which I think is the key to her success. Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsandSweet Apple Temptations"
4,Very nice if you are a journal keeper.,"I usually buy the textbook-like journal. I have six written journals so far. When I went into Borders and saw this journal, I was upset that I didn't start my collection with this journal. This book gives you the ability to write more on each page because of the open-backed spine. You'll love this book, only if you are serious about your writings. The price is better over the net. Trust me...."
2,"REALLY, REALLY BAD!","I am not a ""professional"" reviewer, but I could not agree more with the generalizations about this book. It was simply horrendous. I have read all of Diane Mott Davidson's amusing and charming mysteries. This one must have been penned by someone else. There is not one redeeming quality. To attempt to summarize the plot would be futile because there is very little plot, no character development, no likeable characters and few, if any, surprises. Don't waste your time nor your money on this. Even the recipes are not as appealing as past offerings. Definitely read at your own risk!"
