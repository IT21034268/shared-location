2,"Pales in comparison to ""Born Free""","This is the quite dreadful sequel to ""Born Free."" It is intended for viewing by children, but even young ones will be bored with the extremely slow pace of this feature-length film. Were it shortened by two-thirds to about 30 minutes, it would be reasonably entertaining for younger kids. The acting is cheesy and very dated, and the plot plods along very slowly. There's nothing inherently wrong with the story, and the videography of the lions is quite charming, but it is presented so badly in this film that I would not waste a penny on it. Fortunately, I obtained my copy from the local library."
2,Disappointing!,"This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship, when the opposite is well-known) and credibility (how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did?). It's also boring."
2,Born Free Sequel,This movie is a sequal to Born Free however this movie is not as good as the original. Elsa the lion and her cubs are beautiful creatures who should be left alone so they can stay free.
4,Hamlet - Chopstick Style!,I thought this film was a good loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet. The fighting scenes were good and the story line wasn't bad to my expectations. The Boxset is sick! It contains a bunch of Promotinal Materials with the cast singatures and a little mini sword that could be use for a letter opener. This by far a GREAT collector's item to add in your DVD library. I own a set and so should you!
5,This is a Barney CD,"I purchased a barney CD before, and I was not happy, this CD however made it right. My one year old listeing to it in the car, and it is great. Riff is cool. This is a great CD to buy if your little one like Barney and friends."
3,Not a bad CD,"OK, I must admit that I do like some of the songs on here but not all of them. Some of my favorites are ""Quit Playing Games with my Heart"", ""River"", ""Yoda"", ""Go Speed Racer, Go!"", ""Macarena"", ""Let's Get Together"", and ""I'll Be There For You"". The others on here are just OK. So if your kids like to listen to Radio Disney, then it's a good start to buy this album."
5,Born Free Movie,Love it- geat true story to teach children the importance of living free verses a caged animal
3,Great Message,"""Turning Point"" is a great family film that will touch the hearts of anyone who watches it. I know it did for me. This movie has a really good message for all viewers, as do other films from Little Beth Entertainment. I thought there was a nice music score for this film and photography. Overall, ""Turning Point"" is a nice family film that will touch your heart."
4,Think in Japanese,"I recently bought this to prepare for a trip to Tokyo, and I love the results I'm getting. Although some of the vocabulary is just conversation filler, the explanations, exercises, pictures and dialogues have been very helpful. I feel like I will be pretty fluent when I finish with it, and as a language major in college, I whole-heartedly approve of the use of hiragana, katakana and kanji fron the outset. It causes less interference later. All round a great find."
4,Entertaining and bittersweet; actors are pros!,This is a great story based on Carrie Fisher and her mother and their relationship. Of course Shirley MacLaine is exceptional as always but Meryl Streep surprised me with her talent for singing (this was long before Prairie Home Companion!) Really entertaining.
4,Balancing act between comedy & drama mostly succeeds,"An actress's (Meryl Streep) recovery from drug addiction is complicated by her difficult, competitive relationship with her mother (Shirley MacClaine), a maintenance alcoholic and former star who misses the limelight. Based on Carrie Fisher's autobiographical novel, this film attempts a careful balance between comedy and drama and mostly succeeds. Although it gives short shrift to the seriousness of drug dependence, the comedy is genuinely funny in the capable hands of Streep and (especially) MacClaine. The ending is too tidy for its own good, but this film remains a funny comedy with glimpses of what could have been a searing drama."
4,Theo Review,"Theo, a ten-year-old boy, is an orphan who lives with his brother. He, his brother, and his brothers friend try to survive through the Nazi occupation in WWII. When the three join the resistance, Theo's brother doesn't have much time for Theo anymore. So Theo finds a puppet that his dad made before he dided, called Karageosis. Theo uses Karageosis to share his feelings with--almost as if he's real.The book is exciting because of the resistance acts the brothers perform. It can aslo be a little sad at times, though, you can really get into it.This book would be good for a reader that can be patient and wait for the excitment. They must also have some knowledge on the whole Occupation to understand where Theo's feelings are coming from."
4,Great sophomore album.,"This second album is not disappointing at all. Faith Assembly continues their traditions in making a rich new romantic album. Plenty of great songs here; however, you need to listen to this album a few times before you finally captured it's whole essence. ""Shades of Blue"" is still my favorite FA's album. If you wanna start exploring FA; I suggest you pick up their first album (Shades of Blue) first. Peace !!"
1,"Nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere , , ,","Cause and Effect isn't that great of a band, but they seem to be a strong influence on Faith Assembly. Think droning male lead vocals, with synth lines straight from the bedroom studio. This would not be so bad in itself, but some of the lyrics either swim through so much cliche and/or are such cheesy groaners that I personally can't keep myself from poking for the track advance button on my player.If you are stuck in a circa 1990's synth pop rut and do not have terribly discerning tastes, this album is for you. For the rest of you, may I suggest something along the lines of C&E;'s The Sunrise E.P. instead for contemporary synth pop of a similiarly mellow style.Cheers!"
2,A Rocky Tale,"Armand is a hobo and hates children. One day, he arrives back under the bridge (his home) only to find kids and their mother. He becomes attached to them and gives them life experiences but can he give them there Christmas wish?I thought this book had a great meaning but it wasn't that good. The book wasn't an addicting story, and the story wasn't well written. Also it seemed to change course throughout the story. It was a rocky book and the author didn't do a good job of keeping the story in one style. I wouldn't recommend this book even if it sounds intresting."
2,Water damage not mentioned,"This is the way the book condition was described: ""This is a very clean copy with tight pages, no spine crease and some minor shelf/edge wear."" When I received my order, I noticed that the last 75 pages or so appear to have water damage. The lower outside quarter of each page is rippled. If I had ordered the book as a gift, I would have returned it immediately. I would not order from this seller again.I ordered (and received) the book months ago, and I made notes about its condition when I got it - it just took me a long time to get around to this review."
5,Loved them all !,"Having read all of the books in this series, I must say that the entire epic was a wonderful one. I wonder if Karon could surprise us all and come somehow continue this story. Maybe use some of the same characters, and add some new ones. hmmm.... just a thought.Either way, I will look forward to reading whatever Jan writes next. She does such a wonderful job of placing you in the scene. If you haven't read her others, I would start at the beginning and read them all. If you enjoy some good clean fiction, the series is a must read. Also, I have read the book that I see selling together with Jan's book (Passengers Side). This is an absolutely wonderful book. I have never read anything quite like it, and would also call it a must read.Well, I guess I'll say thank you Jan Karon for many wonderful ""reads."""
5,One of the Best,"This final book in the ""Mitford"" series is one of Jan Karon's best! It is a book of prose. The wonderful descriptions of the places Fr. Tim sees and the devotion of the characters to their church and their ""shepard"" are so fulfilling. Even those stubborn characters have such intering personalities I couldn't wait to visit them again. I realize this is the end of the series but I feel as if we'll meet again...... I think it also shows that senior citizens have a valuable space to fill and that there's always a new adventure around the corner if one is open to it! I hope everyone who has read the other books in the series will read this one and those who haven't read the series will start now!"
2,So disappointing,I had so looked forward to this book and didn't wait for the paperback or take it out of the library. I should have. Why introduce new characters to the end of a series? I found the book confusing and it didn't hold my interest at all. It was just so very disappointing after the first books in the series were so very good. I hope that the Father Tim stories coming in 2007 are much better.
5,Another winner,Jan Karon never let's us down with the characters and feel of the Mitford series. What a wonderful ending! I have already read Home to Holly Springs and look forward to more from Father Tim.
2,Could have been so much better....,"I was so disappointed. Too many characters, big print, no resolution, just...disappointing. Good thing she is on to another series, but this one deserved better."
2,Like Eating an Entire Box of Chocolates,"...too much of a good thing. As much as I loved each of the Mitford books, and as much as I wanted to love this one, I just couldn't. I think maybe Jan Karon overreached. Instead of sticking to Mitford as one might expect in the series closer, Father Tim and Cynthia go off to a new/old church that happens to be just close enough to Mitford for the old characters we've grown so familiar with to pop up regularly. She introduced a score of new characters to go with the new church, and it all became too much to keep straight and, quite frankly, too much to swallow. Too many country-isms, too many perfect endings, too many...you name it. It was just overstuffed. And for all that, there were too many things left unfinished! What happened to Miss Rose, for instance? Did Father Tim and Cynthia make it to Ireland? Did Dooley and Lace marry?I would much rather have ended in Mitford."
1,this was a real stinker,"Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with the last book...Way too many characters, poorly developed plot lines, what happens to Ms. Rose? What happens to Esther Bolick? Kenny just shows up on the doorstep miraculously??? What a cop out of a novel, I'm sorry! Fthr. Tim and Cynthia could not be any more nauseating, I loved them so much more when they had a fight or two! One thing I need to say, is that Karon did write a very fabulous series with very lovable characters. I wonder if she was on a deadline and was forced to send it in to the publishers? I just can't understand what happened."
4,Love it here...,"Light from heaven continues my journey into Mitford and the lives of the citizens of this peaceful town in the mountains. Thank you, Jan Karon, for your wonderful books. Keep writing!"
3,"Light from Heaven (The Mitford Years, Book 9) (Paperback)","If this was going to be the final Mitford series story there should not have been so many new characters introduced. I enjoyed meeting new characters and envisioning Holy Trinity, but not for a final book. Perhaps this should have been a new series. The Mitford characters were practically forgotten. Without going in to detail I will just say a lot of characters I had grown to care about were simply never heard from again, or were simply offered a cameo in this novel. Agreeing with others, . . . . ""What about Miss Rose?!""Plot lines were introduced then suddenly resolved and I couldn't even remember reading how it all came about. There was no in between. Spent a lot of time thumbing back through pages I'd already read trying to figure things out. Sorry, but except for a few moments, this one never grabbed at my emotions as most of the other books did. Everything seemed too rushed. Disappointed."
1,Bad taste and smell,"This lipgloss tasted and smelled terrible...like melted plastic. As much as I enjoy Nars products, I don't recommend this gloss to anyone. Try MAC or Lancome or Revlon. This lipgloss was revolting."
3,good quality but VERY bright fuschia,"This is my first Nars lipgloss. I'd say the quality is good, but the color is different than I expected. I thought the color would be fairly flattering on most people, but when I apply it it is an incredibly bold fuschia color that I think will only look good on a certain number of people. I may be wrong, but it just wasn't a great buy for me in particular. But like I said, the Nars quality seems good."
3,Pretty Color but Tastes AWFUL,"I like the ""naked"" color of this lipgloss...I have very red lips and I try to buy colors that will hide the redness and this does a good job. However, it tastes absolutely disgusting!!! I don't know if I just got a bad one or if they all taste this way, but the taste & smell are horrible!"
4,Touching story,"We have a granddaughter who has cerebral palsy. Her mind is sharp as a tack but she lacks motor skills to do many things other children can do. Her dream is to run and play like other kids. We always tell her God has a special plan for her life. This book is very touching as it addresses the little lamb who was different, but had a very special place in God's plan."
1,A Person with a Disability Speaks Out,"This book is AWFUL! First, the title is offensive. I'm in a wheelchair and I hate the term ""crippled"". It's demeaning and insensitive. I thought Max Lucado was supposed to be a compassionate Christian? By naming the book this title, it not only teaches a new generation another ""hateful"" term it promotes treating people different because of their abilities or lack thereof.Furthermore, I found this to have the message of ""pity the disabled"" not treat them as normal and productive parts of society, which many of us are. If you truly want to educate your children about differences DON'T buy this book. It's ""well meaning"" but inaccurate books like this one that further alienate those of us with disabilities and perpetuate ignorance and misunderstanding."
2,Bunion relief,Did not work well. Could not keep it on at night. Not too comfortable. Can't walk with it if need to get up in the night.
4,I don't see much of a difference...,but I don't use this as often as I should. I will start Monday using this for 30 days straight and report back.
2,Disappointed,At the beginning all was well. You can feel it helping and i would put it on every night. I didnt get it for pain or anything of the sort...just to help minimize my bunion. Unfortunately after 2 weeks of daily use I noticed that the velcro part that tightens or loosens the regulator is beginning to come apart at the seams....Now there are a lot of tiny strings everywhere. I wish it would have lasted longer.
4,...they forgot something...didn't they??,"Streisand at one of her funniest, to say the least about graphic, this is a very enjoyable movie, if you can get past the harshness of Doris. Remembering that this is her character, though, the movie has me laugh everytime I see it. Oh, with the language that goes on in today's movies, and the violence...why, oh WHY, did they have to edit out Doris' confrontation with ""the boys""? I guess after having seen that scene before, I miss it. Maybe those who have never seen the movie might not notice...but I liked the movie so much I pre-ordered it the minute I knew it was to be released. ""Oh, and I suppose all the guys YOU pick up are air conditioned...."" ""What are you studying to be?? A GYNOCOLOGIST??"" Great lines...great movie."
4,Warlike continuation,"Gorgoroth's third output is more of a return to the grand classic ""Pentagram"". This could very well be described as a more compact high-speed version of ""Antichrist"", as fast often-changing riffs fill this disc, riffs that still maintain the ingenious neo-classical atmosphere of earlier albums. The rather infamous production of this offering gives it a bouncy, warlike twist, as the drums are almost ridiculously distinct, but do serve a purpose. Gorgoroth's emotional compositions suit even this aesthetic to perfection, and this work is great both song by song and as a destructively optimistic unity. Excellent."
4,Dreaming of You,"The main reason to get this CD is because it contains that ""other"" Diana Ross / Lionel Richie duet -- ""Dreaming of You."" It's a fun Motown song and only for that reason I give the whole soundtrack 4 stars. Okay, it's fun to hear KISS sing Disco (around this time Gene Simons & Diana Ross were an item), but the soundtrack could have been a bit more exciting. Ross makes it worthwhile though (if you like the song Endless Love, check out Ross's solo version of the song on Why Do Fools Fall In Love)."
5,Fast Service,"The DVD came by the date promised. The audio was in English, just the DVD jacket was in Korean. The DVD worked in my Blu-Ray player and my regular player. The video had good quality."
5,a classic,"if you don't get this, you don't get pure passionate love.if you do, you know what is possible.what we can all aspire to in our intimate relationships."
5,Brings back memories!,This was one of my all time favourite classic films as a kid - its ideal for daughters everywhere! The story line is suitable even for young children and gives a funny yet beautiful cinematic edge to the Cinderella story.
5,THE BEST Cinderella Movie Ever!,"I remember watching a poor quality, overly watched videotape of this movie when I was 6 years old and falling in love. The music is haunting, beautiful and memorable (after years, I still can sing every song from heart). The visuals and surrounding environment are lucious and magnificent. Richard makes a vulnerable and intelligent, very lovable prince charming. And as for Gemma Craven, she's the perfect Cinderella, no woman will ever be able to compare. She beautiful and demure. Her voice is like delicate crystal. She commands the screen with her quiet grace, and her smile is so genuine can can't help but adore her. And adore her I did."
2,A novelty and nothing else,"Okay, it's cute. Listening to this with all the trademark MS sounds and rhythm patterns makes one wish that Chip Davis would go back to composing his own material. Was this necessary for any reason other than to make some big bucks? Disney music has been done to death and one more take on it seems a creative waste of time. Come on, Chip, tap the well of inspiration that gave us Fresh Aire V, VI, and VII. We don't need any more warmed over Christmas or toy store Disney music."
1,Um excuse me...,"Uh I think this is probably just me do please don't be offended, but I just listened to the samples and I think that unless I knew the titles, I wouldn't know what the it was from...Under the Sea sounded like just a bunch of bubbles and all you heard in Hakuna Matata was this guy saying Hakuna Matata. Supercalifragicious was the only song that I gould tell what it was..."
3,Dreary,"I'm glad I checked this out from the library and then read the reviews here before investing my money in it. I'm a fan of M.S. and of the Mouse. So I thought this couldn't miss. But it does, by a wide mark. If you want some jazzy mouse music, check out Dave Brubeck's ""Dave Digs Disney""."
5,Just What I Ordered,Just what I ordered and my wife loved it for christmas and it arrived before christmas. I didn't expect it arrive sooner then the 7 to 10 days they usually tell you... Great
5,Great CD!!!,"I bought this CD for my daughter who was born on 8/20. The cd is very calming and actually helps put her to sleep. Her Dad and I also enjoy listening to the CD with her! A great buy, I would highly recommend this CD for yourself or for a gift!"
2,Not up to par.,"Maybe if this book was wriiten by another author it would have been acceptable, but it certainly isn't up to Jakc Higgin's usual standards. The story seems to drag on with character's plucked straight out of his last book. It almost seems as though this book was written simply to fill the hands of his readers until he could come up with something good."
4,Well paced book for fast read,"You can get an understanding of the plot from the other reviews. Basically, it's a good fast read and hard to put down. It's not Higgins best work, but enjoyable nonetheless. It would be a good first Higgins book because if you like this book you'll love his classics such as: The eagle has flown, The eye of the storm and flight of eagles. Enjoy."
3,"I liked, but didn't love DRINK WITH THE DEVIL","DRINK WITH THE DEVIL is the first Harry Patterson book(writing as Jack Higgins) I have read. Other than the protagonist's character being a little campy, I liked the story and the character development. Not a huge problem, Tom Clancy did the same thing with Jack Ryan. The guy is just too special. The ""plot holes"" another reviewer was bothered by didn't cause me any problems. The proof of the pudding is that I'm planning on reading more of Patterson's books. DRINK WITH THE DEVIL is worth a read!"
4,A toxic story in deed!,This story is another page turner. I really enjoyed it a lot!! Read this one and enjoy it. I sure did.
4,they enjoy what they're doing and it shows,These guys are having a ball doing what they believe in. What more could you ask for. It's basic kick butt rock without slick production and synth tracks. They still got it. Hope another album comes out some tmie soon.
1,Breaking the cycle,"well 1st $1.99 for a movie that is only 1 hr. long is a rip in it self,but then you have the extremely BAD acting .and the 1st sex scene if ya want to call it that was one of the guys at a male theatre hooking up w/sunshine from Queer as Folk. And they have sex right by the doors to the auditorium w/o anyone wanting to join in or fondling themselves, I mean come on.Then the computers they were using were from the early 90's .DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ,LET ALONE YOUR TIME."
2,Low quality stainless is this pan's problem,"I bought this saucepan just over a year ago here on Amazon and the bottom coating seems to be peeling off....I notice another reviewer has commented on this and I have to agree that this is a problem. The question is, ""is it a health problem"" and I don't know the answer to that, but I can't in good faith recommend this Farberware saucepan."
5,Farberware Classic Saucepans are the Greatest,Farberware Classic Saucepans are the Greatest. Just ordered a 1 Qt. and a 1 1/2 Qt. Saucepan after having used these types for a few years. They are the BEST!!!
4,Necessary but not sufficient,"This is one of those books that is still around becauseit fills a niche that no modern book has been ableto fill. It introduces N=1 susy quickly and concisely.The reader must work through every equation in orderto get something out of this book. The reason why peoplecontinue to use this book of equations is because theequations are right. If you try other books, they arefilled with typos and sometimes even more serious errors.Get through the first 8 chapters of this bookmay be chapter 22 and 24 then get into Argyres' notesthat delve into the modern aspects of supersymmetricquantum field theory."
3,Furry forever!,"Although this is not Furry's best work, it's not the worst introduction to the fine singing, guitar-playing, and songwrting of this underappreciated blues master. The sound quality is excellent, which allows for a closer appreciation of the fine details of Furry's picking than some of the older recordings; however, listeners are advised to turn to Furry's recordings from the 1920s to gain a true appreciation of the man's incredible talent."
1,Sweet Shrub: retelling of a race riot,"I read the first book in the trilogy and picked up A Place Called Sweet Shrub just because the author had killed off so many characters in the first and left much unanswered that I naively thought resolution would come in the sequel. I was wrong. Lucinda had so much going for her in the West Texas hardened by encounters with Christobel and Mrs. Sully that I thought her character would continue to grow. Instead, the book was a grandiose setup for the time displaced rehash of a race riot. The ribald humor was misplaced and characters are killed off haphazardly. I knew not to expect plot resolution, but some motivation would have been appreciated."
5,Excellent reading!,This book is written in such a way to document the historical value and so interestingly you don't even realize you are learing all along the way. I found the book accurate as to the stories as I remember the old people telling them.
5,Amel does it again!,"What a beautiful offering from soul/folk singer Amel Larrieux. Although I wasn't a big fan of Groove Theory's and didn't purchase Amel's solo debut, Amel made a lifelong fan out of me with Bravebird and this follow up does not disappoint. Although I don't love every song on the album, the songs I do like are so powerful that I listen to the cd daily and never tire of it. Trouble is fun with a light feel to it. Unanswered Question speaks to anyone who has ever wondered how the person they loved felt about them in return. No One Else is a beautiful, self-explanatory ballad and Morning has a soothing tone. Weary is the most commercial song on the album and it is wonderful as well but my absolute favorites are the understated Gills and Tails, and the hauntingly beautiful Mountain of When. If you are a fan of Amel's, the only thing that will disappoint you about this CD is that there just isn't enough of it!"
5,Anything you record............,"Since the ""Groove Theory"" days, I have always had a thing for Amel's sultry,soft sound, and til' this day, I STILL say Amel"" TELL ME IF YOU WANT ME TOO""? Because I will never stop wanting more. Kepp up the excellent music coming. Your devoted minion......."
4,Very good anthology though less than complete,"It's a little puzzling as to why there are two substanially different versions for the UK and US release of Unfinished Business. While this is the more generous collection (with 13 additional tracks) it is missing key tracks from the US version as well.Still, it wouldn't be a Kinks related album if there wasn't business problems and inconsistency. This album actually merits 4 1/2 stars only because it's missing some key tracks from the US version (the US version only gets 41/2 for the same reason).With Velvel (the US distributor) in financial trouble, it might be wise to pick up the US version in addition to this simply because it may not be available for too much longer."
3,"typical wit, but ending lacks steam","About the first 75% of this book was full of typical Adams' unpredictable wit, peculiar characters and the most unusual situations ever drempt of. This is why I read Adams' - refreshing to read something which isn't so cold and lacking subplots, which are typically hilarious.However, the last 25% seemed to be lacking everything one expects from an Adams' novel. The first Holisitc Detective Agency book was much better in regards to cover to cover wit. Long Dark Tea-time just lost all of its steam once it came to the three-quarters point. It was too descriptive and at the same time lacking any humor in the description. It would have been easy to hack out a few of the ending chapters.Disappointed."
1,What No Ending???,The book itself is typically entertaining except for a horrendous glitch with the recording meaning that the last CD repeats the first few tracks ad nauseum and the book never ends. ARRRRGH. Basically it should be withdrawn from sale and rectified. Don't buy it!!!
2,Nowhere near as good as Hitchhiker's,"There were funny parts in this story, but they were few and far between, and the plot was intersting on those few occasions when it actually made any sense. The plot is very confusing and takes more than one read-through to understand, but I found the book too boring to re-read, so while reading the book my thoughts were, ""When am I going to get to another funny part?"" and upon finishing it, ""Oh. Okay."" To summarize, the plot is too convoluted and boring to be a good mystery, and not funny enough to be good humor."
5,a favorable review,"This book is simply hilarious. This novel brings about the return of Svald, infamously known as Dirk, Gently, who must contend with a coca-cola machine, a client's head found revolving on a record, and an angry thunder god. Don't miss it!"
2,Has anyone actually heard THE CD?,"Sixty-four out of the 66 reviews currently up talk about THE BOOK. The product listed is THE AUDIO CD of the book. I ordered the CD set for Christmas, and it was good - up until the final, 6th CD. There, one section repeats over and over, over all 18 tracks. It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. (I apologize for appearing to shout here.) Has anyone reviewing this product actually listened to the CD from beginning to end? Are they all this way, or have I gotten two clinkers in a row?Thank you."
1,TERRIBLE,"I spent most of the time laughing at the sheer ridiculousness and predictability of this movie (who on Earth would say that this movie had unexpected plot twists?). Yeah, the dubbing was awful, but it only added on to what was already a bad, bad movie. Even my roommate, who normally hates watching scary movies because she thinks they're too scary, laughed all the way through this one. And, uh, what kind of police officer would discuss a rape with people OTHER than the immediate family? <-- Just one of the many truly stupid scenes in the movie. C'mon, skip this one--unless you're looking for something for ""bad movie night"" (as in my case; I thought it looked stupid from the packaging--""grizzly"" instead of ""grisly""? please...), and then this one takes the cake."
3,"wrong place ,,wrong time","to begin with,,many blues lovers do not know mr.shorty including myself, but if you will listen to this album chances are you will probably keep the album and treasure it.the album has no fillers, all tracks are good,i happen to own this album because blues revue gave it to me as my gift and was so surprised to hear that shorty is a good guitarist. had guitar shorty been a white american and has the looks of mick taylor he would be an instant superstar. i ranked him with buddy guy as his equals in all department.my recommendation is you can buy this album and just listen to it without scanning the cover of the cd. best wishes to mr. shorty,"
4,A Really Good Start To An Excellent Series,"This is a very engaging book. It was lots of fun to be introduced to Long Piddleton and to its assortment of eccentric characters. The plot itself is fairly complex, although not completely difficult to figure out, and it ends with what appears to be an action sequence in the life of the Richard Jury books--in a church, no less!It is interesting to be introduced to Vivian, the femme fatale of Richard Jury, Melrose Plant, etc., in this book. I am not sure that I ocmpletely see the attraction, but that seems to be one of the interesting truths about relationships that comes out in Martha Grimes' books--relationships and attractions have a strength and life of their own."
3,Good not great,"It's the first in a series so if you like murder mystery series books it's best to start at the beginning. The characters are a bit sparse though and only two are a tad more fleshed out than the others, Melrose Plant and Richard Jury himself. You'll learn a bit of English pub naming conventions which is an interesting bit of information. The plot is not very plausible but it is mysterious. All the little threads mostly come together at the end but it is a tortuous route."
2,Farberware 13 piece set - a big disappointment!,"I bought the Farberware 13 piece set after reading previews from other customers, with great hopes that I will get good performance. Unfortunately, on the first use itself, the 2 qt sauce pans were permanently tainted so that the inside and outside walls have a warped look as though the steel is burnt and the metal has lost its shape. Very difficult to describe unless I post a picture of the pan along with this review. Overall, I feel very disapponted with the quality of this cookware. Looks like I will have to shell out hundreds of dollars to buy the more expensive brands such as Calphalon or All-Clad."
3,"Avoid ""Non-Stick"" cookware.","Unless you find a bargain like this; then buy them and invest some of the savings into a breath-mask and a wire-wheel brush for your drill to remove it.Otherwise, the coating will scratch, or burn. That means that at some point during the liftime of the product, you will be eating or breathing a flurocarbon compound that is more than just mildly toxic.However, at this price, you could simply give away the skillets and keep the rest. You could easily pay $68 dollars for the stock pot alone.Replace them with cast iron (search Kictchen and Housewares for cast iron skillets) and you will find many bargains on cast-iron cookware. (Check my other reviews for personal picks.)"
1,Farberware is not for a serious cook!,"This stuff is so stinking light-weight that I did not even bother testing it in my kitchen!!! Once again, maybe O.K. for the dorm, but let's be serious....nobody in their right mind would use this on a daily basis!!!"
4,"Very nice, but wary of handles","I use this pot exclusively for making iced tea, since my family drinks it by the barrel! This pot keeps it shine well, and cleans up easily- the only issue I had was the handles are plastic and welded onto the pot, not bolted to it. Not sure how long the handles will last because of this (imagine lifting a potful of water at least 2-3 times a week), but all in all, a great little pot to have!"
3,Gift,"I have loved Max Lucado's books. HE writes with such passion and sincerity for children and for adults. I was, however, disappointed with this book. The story was simplistic and terribly predictable. I am usually able to turn to the illustrations to support the story, but this led me to another disappointment. Hunt's drawings simply were very busy. Good illustrations are able to tell the story by themselves, with no text. Even with the text, one would have trouble deciphering exactly what these drawings were depicted. The overall redeeming quality of this book is how it does present a Christian story and reminds all of us of the lowly life our Lord was born into.Why 3 stars?:While Max Lucado's books for children are normally wonderful, this one falls well short of the bar. The illustrations actually hurt the story, not support it. This is, however, a book about the glory that is Jesus Christ, and does therefore deserve to be read and shared with children."
4,"This book was very well, and I like book on Jacob","Jacob is a helper, wants to make build. He is Christian, but say he is Jewish, because writer. Max Lucado. Very good, I am learning English because of him I learn the giving a gift to children, I give gift to God. This is a strong message, so I gave a presented to homeless, but he gets mad and said bad things. This book would be good for homeless man, a gift, to be generus and not try to hit me, give me feeding trough like Jacob I want to ask. He lives my street. This is a good book for Christians like me."
3,movie,"I purchased this video for our preschoolers to 5th grade AWANA clubbers to watch for Christmas. Was a little disappointed it wasn't animated as described. It is a good movie however is only 22 min long, a bit deceiving because the package states it is an hour long."
1,I din't like this book at all!!!!,"At first this book seemed like it was going to be soemthing special. It had everything I like people making stuff out of wood, people from strange religions, and a good message about trying hard. But then Jacob had a hallusination and then the book got really preachy and boring. I din't like the end either."
5,American Theocracy,This is the second book of Kevin Phillips that I have read. Gives you a complete different look at what happens around you everyday.
5,Incisive,Kevin Phillips never fails to cut through the historical fog in documenting the sociopolitical forces at work in the shaping of our current society. Definitely worth your time.
2,Not worth the purchase,"If you are ""down"" on the conservative Christian, then you may be able to identify with this author. Otherwise - don't waste your time or money."
3,more of the same,"Kevin Phillips helped start the era of Republican dominance in Presidential politics back with the Emerging Republican Majority back in the Nixon era, and has spent thirty years since then preaching against those he helped. This book is more of the same of his post Republican discontented phase. The sections on economic dominance based on resources are interesting, but the book suffers from excessive repetition as well as his obvious hatred of the Bush clan, which causes him to become a bit splenetic at times"
2,Average campy movie,"As we all know -- this movie did not win an Oscar. However, if you are a person who loves Drew and/or need to kill time I'll say give it world. Yes it is quite low-budgeted, for example, there is a scene where Holly and Patrick have sex in the kitchen -- in the window there is a tree lim tapping against the door. I found that funny because you can tell it was poorly manipulated, LOL. Basically the reviews are spot on with how negative they are about the picture, I'm being nice giving it two stars since it's mainly a B-movie or TV movie quality. Thankfully this movie did not kill Drew's career as she was finally getting her career back on track after years of drug abuse."
1,What? It's not a spoof???,"I wanted to see what Drew was doing 15 years ago. I thought this was a bad attempt at a horror spoof with no laughs. Now I know it was just a bad film with unintentional goofs everywhere. Oh well, show biz people have to learn their trade somehow. Glad I didn't pay."
1,poor quality,"I purchased this from renovaters supply in March 2005. The rod itself is made of solid brass tubing which is why I purchased this. However, the wall of the tubing is made from incredibly thin brass and will bend if you hang a wet towel on it. The chrome plating is also of poor quality. For $100, you would think this would be top quality. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,Solid Album,"Geelong rockers Magic Dirt have been on the local music scene since the early 90's. This is my first Magic Dirt album, and I was anxious just to see the quality of their music.Snow White kicks off with the track ""Like a Demon"". It becomes apparent just from the opener what Magic Dirt are all about. They give off a raw rock sound, and the songwriting and lyrics are decent enough, but Adalita's vocal limitations are exposed throughout the album.Standout tracks are ""Mother's Latest Fear"", first single ""Locket"" and the melodic ""I Love the Rain"".To be fair, Snow White is a solid all-round album, but doesn't break any new boundries or command much attention. It's light, listenable pop-rock that is worth a few spins, but is by no means comparable to other female-fronted rock bands Garbage and Killing Heidi."
2,I didn't like it.,"The backpack broke after less than a month of use. The material was pretty flimsy for the price. Overall, very disappointing."
3,Good but could be better!,If only they could remake this album completely with new recordings. The album has so much potential but the sound is horrible. (not as bad as Ulver's Nattens Madrigal though)
1,The Anti-Catholic Bible,"This book has been referred to by many as the Anti-Catholic Bible. After reading it, I see why. The author makes many convincing arguments regarding the non-Scriptural basis for Catholic ideology. However, the author is looking at Roman Catholicism from a Protestant perspective. Roman Catholicism, like Judaism, is based as much on oral tradition as it is on Scripture. Take this one with a grain of salt."
1,Author obviously has NO idea,This book totally misconstrues the Catholic Faith. It takes the Bible itself out of context as well as all Catholic references. It is a sad display of untruth. For a true view of the Catholic faith read a good book like Catholism and Fundementalism By Karl Keating
1,Straw man theology at it's best,Boettner raises a giant straw man of his own construction then demolishes it as evil before the eyes of the reader. Had he actually presented Catholic doctrine for discussion he could have made the claim to be intelectually honest. As it stands Boettner's book is for people who want to reinforce their own misconceptions of the Church to make themselves feel better.
1,"Very well written, but misleading","""There are not 100 people in the United States who hate the Catholic Church. There are millions, however, who hate what they wrongfully believe the Catholic Church to be.""-Archbishop Fulton SheenIn this ""bible"" of anti-catholocism, Mr. Boettner presents a (seemingly) very convincing argument on all the ""evils"" of the Catholic Church. He claims to expose all the pagan origins and the sinful practices of the vatican. Unfortunatly, as Catholic theologians like Dr. Scott Hahn have pointed out, most of his quotes and refrences are misleading and taken out of context. I do not have the space to list all the errors on here, but do a Google.com search on the topic and see for yourself.For the record, I am not Roman Catholic. I just feel that it is wrong to misrepresent one of the world's most complex and beautiful religious traditions."
2,A curate's egg....,"For those who don't know the story of the curate's egg, basically the conclusion is that ""it's good in parts"".I read this book as a young Christian, and although I appreciated the mixture of scripture and anecdote, eventually the book became stilted - especially when it started to say that the RC's were ""unconstitutional"" (I'm not from the US).The all time best line comes in either chapter one or two. It is so funny and out of date that I can remember it by rote.""If the United States were to become Roman Catholic, the result, undoutedly, would be the conquest of this nation and the rest of the world by Russian Communism"".Don't get me wrong, I think the RC church is fatally flawed and unbiblical - but linking Commies and Catholics is not only unwarranted, but hysterical. Boettner does not help either Catholics or protestants with his deeply flawed polemic."
1,A very questionable fabrication. . .,"The late Rev'.d Boettner was known both in Protestant and Catholic circles as being a rabid anti-Catholic. Catholic apologists have accurately termed this book ""The Anti-Catholic Bible"". However, one 1) needs to understand what one attacks, 2) needs to document one's charges, and 3) needs to be minimally informed about history, theology, etc. BEFORE one starts throwing around accusations.This book is an embarassment to Protestants. If one wishes to criticize or contradict or disagree with a doctrine held by the Catholic Church, surely such things can be done with integrity and without hate-speech.""Beloved, let us love one another"" says the Apostle. If Boettner feels that Catholics are in need of salvation, and that their religious system is flawed (at best), this can be said with love, not hate."
1,Outrageous pack of lies,"As a former protestant turned Catholic, I have done substantial research myself into the doctrinal basis of Catholic Church teaching. And my conclusion: this book is at best an example of poor scholarship.......but is probably more likely a deliberate attempt to spread anti-Catholic propaganda to unknowing protestants. If you want the TRUTH about Catholic Church doctrine, better to read Karl Keating's ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"" or Alan Schreck's ""Catholic and Christian"". If you are gonna disagree with Catholic Church doctrine, at least know what the actual doctrine IS!!!"
1,Wrong title,The title misrepresents this book. One thinks they are getting a better knowledge of Catholicism. This book is untrue. The author is an uniformed person who for some reason wants to lash out at the Catholic Church.
1,insults your intelligence,"I bought this book in hard cover at a Protestant book store and was surprised at the low price. Apparently, they print them cheap in order to get them in the hands of as many people as possible? I started reading it and had to stop--it was so full of lies and inaccuracies--it insulted my intelligence."
3,Who Are These People?,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie except a few rehashed lessons about the dot-com fallout. For the people who think the business was flawed to begin with, look at EZGov; they're still in business (sadly, the principal competitor featured in the film died tragically). The main characters in the film aren't exactly likeable. Kaleil comes off as arrogant, a backslapping rah-rah kind of manager. Tom comes off as a new age sensitive, let's sing Cumbaya in the woods guy. Every scene with the two of them is a love-fest, even the ones where they're at each other's throats. None of them seem too concerned about having the best product. The only guy I can respect is the ""third founder"" - the one who sold out at the very beginning."
3,You'll Watch it Once and then Never Again,"This is a great documentary on the beginning and end of an internet company. As soon as you watch this movie once, you won't ever need to watch it again.It's insane how much of the rise and fall of their company they were able to capture. If you love/collect documentaries, then this would be a must have, but if you're looking for a great movie on a dot com failure, then go out and rent it."
2,Arrogance Gets Its Due,"First off, this is a horrid ""documentary"". A little narration would have gone a LONG way.I gave it two stars because I thought it made a good dark comedy. These guys are living characatures.Let's be honest about this: $60M ... 18 months. That's $3.33M per MONTH. To go through that kind of money without producing anything of any value takes serious (bad) talent.The co-founder who bailed early was the only smart one in this travesty. The rest of it is just ego-stroking and ""poor me"" when things fall apart.Now they are saying that they don't receive any money from this movie. That they're using it as a promo piece for their new business. After seeing THIS ... what idiot would trust these two?"
4,If you like the 'Net you will like this.,When I first started watching this movie I thought it wasn't going to be that good. As I got into it totally changed my mind. I am thinking about starting a dot com. This movie really gave me insight on what goes on behind the scenes. This is a must have movie!
4,Good value for the price,"This was a replacement for an 8 qt. Farberware stockpot that we accidentally burnt through. It is almost an exact replacement, but not quite. The lid is a little smaller. The old lid fits a frying pan, so that was a bonus. We use it a lot to cook soups, beans, and stews and it heats quickly and evenly. The handles are great because they don't require oven mitts to move the pot. They don't have exposed rivets inside, either, that would trap food, so we don't worry about cleanup or sanitary issues."
2,beer bands,"Although a cute addition to the party, they didn't last long. After stretching over a can or bottle for 2 days of our 4 day weekend party, some of them fell apart. I like the idea and needed something like this for a large group."
2,Not Stable,"The 2.0"" Receiver Stabilization Assy' is cheap and does not keep the rack and or the bikes stable."
5,This stuff wears like iron!,"I received this 3-quart Farberware saucepan for my bridal shower and it still looks like new. And that was in 1973! I've used it continuously over the years with excellent results every time. It's very dishwasher-safe, which is a big plus. I highly recommend this piece, especially at this price!"
3,balance is not good,"The Farberware Classic 3-Qt Saucepan is lovely to look at, cooks nicely (Alum. cap on bottom distributes heat evenly), cleans up beautifully ... and now for the negatives for me ...It is heavier than my previous 3 qt. Farberware saucepan and if it only has a little food in it (as in sauteing onions or cooking bacon before adding the meat or vegetables to go into the soup or stew) I have to be careful to line up the handle with one of the 5 gas stove's burner prong supports so that the pan does not tip."
2,Starting to rust,The product arrived on time and looked great but rust spots started to show on the inside bottom after just a few times of boiling water.
4,Not the same size as the Original,"I have used Farberware sauce pans for over 30 years. They have been dependable, easy to use, and easy to clean. Recently I accidently boiled the 3-qt saucepan dry. Very dry. The aluminum clad bottom separated from the pan. I have the double boiler and steamer inserts for this size pan. I just needed the replacement 3-qt pan. I ordered the Classic. It certainly looked like the same pan and held the same amount, 3 quarts. However, although it is labeled ""Classic,"" and the style is similar, it is smaller in diameter and the inserts won't work with it. I wrote to Farberware. Their reply acknowledged the different sizes and would I like to buy more new cookeware? The new but not-quite ""Classic"" pan works fine. If you aren't trying to replace a classic saucepan, try Farberware. You will probably like it as I have."
5,Saucepan,Another gift for my mother. Perfect size for making soups for four people or less. As with all the other faberware pots it looks good and cleans up nicely.
3,Third in the Autumn series,"The survivors from AUTUMN and AUTUMN: THE CITY have finally come together and are holed up in a military bunker. Unfortunately, the soldiers in said bunker have been cut off from the virus and are not immune, making things complicated for the groups. As the dead swarm above, the survivors come to the conclusion that they must soon move on. Their opportunity comes when the soldiers begin a mass attack on the horde outside.Third in the series of five presents new challenges to the growing group. The interaction with the military was brief. Not sure if this element will return (though they're kind of doomed anyway). The end of PURIFICATION was great, though, and I look forward to what comes next for these poor survivors!"
5,Zombie Fiction with Brains and Heart,"David Moody continues to go against the trend by writing zombie fiction (without the word 'zombie') and swapping gore for intelligent storytelling and deep character development. This is smart fiction, written with style and insight. Not for the gore-hounds who can't think past a pile of entrails, but the rest of the readers in the world (including the legion of zombie fans with working brains), this is a perfect next chapter in the wonderful AUTUMN series. Landmark."
3,Please see my other review for Autumn,"I've read all the books from the Autumn series. Really good stories, but at times it was hard for me to force myself to pick the books up. For more on this check my other review for the first book of the series, Autumn."
2,All over the road on acid,"I had a problem with this film. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase."
4,Captures the flavor and freedom of early-70's cinema,"This film isn't perfect but it is wonderfully-original and refreshing. The acting is excellent, the story is fractured but interesting, and there's not a cliche to be found. Watching the film, I found it interesting that while the film takes place in the early 70's, it also reflects the freedom given to directors back then in that post-""Easy Rider""/pre-blockbuster era. I'm a little amazed that a movie this off-the-wall and different could be made these days but I'm glad it was."
3,the sweaty bits were a little weird,"okay, i loved most of this book. sedaris is, in my opinion, the best essay writer of our era. what i loved about ""DENIM"" was how, as children, the author and his sisters knew the theraputic value of a good cry. hilarious. and the brother paul is just an all-too-familar slice of suburban life. but all the mention of sweat... ick... c'mon, just creepy. nonetheless, i will happily be passing this book on to a certain suburban mother of a ten year-old boy with vase full of cat tails (pg 165) in his room (and possibly scotchguarded drapes). maybe she'll finally get it."
2,"Mildly entertaining, at best","Not funny. Mildly entertaining, at best. I found myself just wanting to be done with the book already. Sedaris was a genius with ""Naked."" Nothing else he has done compares--and ""Corduroy and Denim"" just takes him further away."
4,Totally Funny,"This book made me laugh and laugh. It is short stories primarily about David's life/family. It is a million times better than his other book ""Holidays on Ice"". I highly recommend Dress Your Family but stay away from Holidays on Ice. It is aweful."
5,Dress Your Family in Cords or enim,"This book is hysterical! Probably one of his best works if not the best.If you like Sedaris at all then you must read this (even though it's not his latest). It's even funny a second time around, the semi biographical short stories don't get dated."
1,"Gay Man vs. Crazy World-This Book is Bizarre, Disturbing & Not At All Funny!","The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a lot of strange and scary things to ponder. The author rambles for several chapters, then takes the reader along for his silly interpretation of 'family' life. If only the world were like him, he imagines that everything would be okay. Sedaris is flagrantly self-absorbed and immature. A truly disappointing read."
2,"Wanted to like this, but Sedaris might not be likeable.","I have heard David Sedaris on National Public Radio and always really liked his stuff. He's funny and clever, and I was really looking forward reading one of his books.But Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is terrible. Most of the time it feels like he is confessing things he knows are reprehensible, but with a contemptuous adolescent, remorseless tone. It is perverse, really. As the narrator of the book, he says cruel, racist, petty things about just about everyone else he mentions in the book with no trace of humor or irony. I hate to say it, but he seems like just an ugly person.The book made me uncomfortable to read, and at the second reference to how surprised he was at seeing ""white servants"", I took it back to the store. There are too many inspiring, challenging books in the world to waste time reading something like this. I can't speak for his other books, and I still like him on NPR, but pass on this one, friends."
1,Has Sedaris Lost His Touch?,"I see that there are some mixed reviews of this new book - 'Corduroy and Denim' and I come down on the critical side. I must qualify this by saying that David Sedaris' other books are the funniest that I have ever read. 'Me Talk Pretty' had me in stitches, belly-laughing the whole time. The new book is more depressing than funny. Also, it seems to me that David has gone from integrating his homosexuality (and sexuality in general) into the stories as a contextual element to using it as graphic focus that is not particularly funny. With that said, I wonder if gay readers find more humor in the more explicit style - maybe I am just not the target audience for this book...Anyhow, I love Sedaris and hope that his next book goes back to the laugh-out-loud style."
3,Class Sedaris!,"I'm only giving this book three stars based on the fact that it in no way comes close to ""Naked"" or ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"". I love David's books and I will read anything this guy publishes. But based on my past experiences with Sedaris literature, this one lags far behind it's predecessors. Unfortunately for David Sedaris, he set the bar so high with ""Naked"" that it's so hard to top it. And that's a good thing.You won't be disappointed by this book at all. You just might not love it as much as his other work."
4,Hysterical and very very very unique,"I had never read something like this before.In my opinion, David Sedaris is a very talented man, he has such a creativity and imagination to narrate things and events in such a brutal, honest and unique way that just make it hilarious.It suprised me how peculiar his family is, and how different they all are from one another. But again, the way he tells the stories are just funny.I do recommend it if you want to get a few laughs out of it. ^_^"
2,You read it in the New Yorker or in a different book.,"One of the things I just don't get about David Sedaris is his uncanny ability to recycle. Must be a greek thing.You will have definately read at least half of these stories somewhere else if you are at all familiar with Sedaris.It's resissued, repackaged Sedaris.Me Talk Pretty One Day, is a much better read."
3,"No laughs, but an ok read","When I read Sedaris' ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" I laughed harder than I have before or since. I also found Sedaris' ""Santaland Diaries"" to be hysterical. What happened here? I don't think I even smiled while reading ""Dress Your Family."" It is a sad and painful book to read. If that's what you like, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for another Me Talk Pretty, keep looking."
4,Definitely worth it!,"I was very impressed with this book. Overall, I didn't find it as funny as ""Me Talk..."", however, I found that it was more solid. The stories overall seemed tighter. Sedaris has a talent for being blatantly honest and portraying himself with a harsh honesty that would make some people wince. He often portrays himself in a negative way which makes the reader feel an underdog sense of loyalty. My favorite essay in ""Me Talk..."" was ""You Can't Kill The Rooster"". His ""Rooster"" essays in this book did not disappoint! This book really gave you a strong sense of his family. His writing is so relatable that you feel his family could be your own with all the idiosyncrises, drama and humor. You will most definitely enjoy this book!"
3,"In the same vein as ""Naked.""","This book is true David Sedaris, funny, a little somber at times, but always thought-provoking. While none of his other works will compare to the outstanding ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" this book is a good, entertaining summer read. Rarely do I see the world the way I do than after a David Sedaris book, and it's a happy experience when I can look at my surroundings in the seemingly normal, yet insanely comical way that he does. ""Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Demin"" made me want to go back and re-read the full Sedaris collection, and I will, with great pleasure."
4,"10"" Covered frypan Farberware","I like this frypan. It has an aluminum core with stainless steel on the outside. It has a two inch lip around the perimeter so I can fill it up. I live alone but I do cook for guests. I recently cooked wild salmon in the oven at 350 degrees for 12 minutes after the fish was seared on both sides in olive oil. It didn't stick and was delicious. It does not have a non-stick surface which I perfer, I just put a little olive oil in the pan and rubbed it around with a paper towel. If something does stick I use Dawn POT SCRUBBER and it's clean in a jiffy.But be careful, the handle gets hot and so does the knob on the lid. The price fit my budget too and delivery was fast. Bill"
1,Lid Size Not Accurately Described!!,"The lid on the Farberware Classic 10 inch Frypan does NOT interchange with the lid on the Farberware Vintage 10 inch Frypan. I was planning on being able to interchange the lids on the new Classic Series and the old Vintage Series Frypan because they are both listed as 10 inch, but, it does not interchange--since when is ""10 inch"" not really ""10 Inch"". The new classic series lid is a smaller diameter than the old vintage series lid. Extremely unhappy about this. Will probably not buy any Farberware products from Amazon again!!"
1,HARD TO SEE!!!!,Bought this for my 6yr old for Christmas but never actually gave it to her cause its really hard to see the answer numbers when you push down on one of the buttons. It would be nice if it lit up or something to make it easier to see. I returned this item and I will be buying the Leap Frog twist and shout multiplication instead.
3,Hard to see numbers,"To view answers you must press really HARD to see numbers. It's almost like to plastic buttons are too thick or need to be more translucent in order to view the numbers more clearly. Overall, the quality seems to be good."
4,Good tool to learn your multiplication,"Good product that been around for years, I learned off this tool when I was a kid and know my multiplication by heart thanks to this and I am 31 years old 9x9= and I know with out thinking its 81 for example no need to count in my head, this is about rememorization of numbers. Just now days kids want everything electronic so it may be tuff for some kids to learn off, like my 10 year old daughter."
2,can't see the answers,"This thing is inexpensive and I am designing a do-this-in-the-car game by multiplying numbers that we see on the street. Anything to give the confidence to excel. (multiplying--it's not just for third graders anymore) However, it is difficult to see the answers."
4,Multiplying learning help,I bought this to help my grandchildren learn to multiply better. I hope it works. It will if they actually use it. It shows a problem and when you press the key it will give you the answer. The idea is to guess the answer before you push the button. I'm crossing my fingers that it will help and that they will have fun using it.
3,Hard to read answer,As in other reviews it is difficult to see the answer. The answer should have been placed higher in the square. Be sure you have good lighting to use for it to be somewhat effective. It is durable for the car and good for trips as long as there is adequate daylight.
4,holes large,"The ""holes"" in the register are quite large - larger than our old louvered register. The cat has knocked several items down into it, and so we may have to find some kind of chicken wire or someting to put underneath to catch these items before they fall down into the air vents. The registers are very nice looking, however."
5,Superb!,"I read this a few months ago. I was recovering from a back injury and thankfully I had this book with me. There aren't many books that pull this level of detail and numerous character introductions without overwhelming the reader. It engages you from the beginning and gets better and better as you read. I let out a long breath when I was done,and I actually felt as if I had accomplished the deed of freeing Scotland myself. Spectacular!"
2,Pot discolored on inside after one use.,"I have a 40 year old set of Farberware aluminum clad over stainless and accidentally burnt one 2 qt pot. Tried to replace it with this all stainless pot but after one use of heating soup and cleaning and drying by hand, the inside bottom of the pot is all discolored and looks like mottled rust and blue and orange stains. Contacted Farberware and they said I had to use special cleaners everytime I use this pot to scrub the inside discoloring away. Too much work. Will order aluminum clad next time."
2,Not worth the money,I enjoyed the sandals at first but I've had them for a few months and the soles are worn down quite a bit and the sponginess was gone after a month or so. I don't think these are any better than what you might get at AE or Aero but they cost almost double. My last pair of sandals were a heavy rubber sole that made that pair last almost ten years (though they were heavier). These as well as almost everything out there are just foam and won't last.
1,It's so hard to tell how something will fit by a picture.,"But One Size Fits All just isn't the case with this hat. While it does fit on my head, with the strap adjusting to the correct length, the hat does not pull down nearly as far as any of the other hats I own.I wanted a blank hat, that would go with anything, but this hat does not fit down to the top of your ears, where I think you'd want it to (it comes up about 1 inch short or more). So your head will definitely be cold in the winter, and you will definitely feel like you're wearing a yamaka, and not a baseball cap.I don't just think it's that I have a big head, I think this hat is just made differently than you'd expect."
4,baaaaahaaaaaaa!,"oh man i love the negative reviewers here...harvest moon was a comeback? uh,yeah, after this note's for you, freedom, and ragged glory....and the other dude, saying how horns are wrong on a neil record. uh, guess you don't like freedom, or after the goldrush for that matter (the oboe solo in the title song)oh, and as for the new record, prairie wind. well done, not all the songs work (for me) but the good ones are realllllly good. standouts, in order of my preference: falling of the face of the earth, no wonder, prairie wind, the painter. i guess i would rate the rest as this old guitar, here for you, when god made me, far from home, he was the king, and it's a dream. if you're a musician by all means get the special edition with the bonus dvd, it shows the recording of the whole album. ben keith wins mvp for his slide work (although all the musicians are stellar)"
2,"Great music, terrible recording/sound quality","The recording is so bass heavy that it is not pleasurable to listen to. The music on this CD is also on the live ""Heart of Gold"" DVD movie...the sound quality is quite good on the live recording. Mr. Young's performance of the songs is also better on the live recording."
3,CD good but PBS special from Ryman Auditorium better,"I bought the Prairie Wind CD after watching a PBS special on Neil Young performing live at the Ryman in Nashville. Nothing beats the sound of that auditorium, not even the current Opryland Auditorium. I'm happy with the CD."
2,Prairie Wind Blows,"Boy, was I excited for the new Neil Young album, Prairie Wind. I'm a long time Neil fan, and even through rough patches (by which I mean insanity like Trans and Neil and the Shocking Pinks) he's always bounced back with something good.Well, not this time. Coming off his latest rough patch (the Broadway show wanna-be Greendale) he moves right to another.I had high hopes for this album. I love Harvest and Harvest Moon! I bought Prairie Moon as soon as it was released. Damn, what a disappointment. You can hear some good songs in there, struggling to get out - but they're buried under unnecessary strings, horns, and choruses.Produced by Ben Keith, (who also produced Harvest Moon, Comes a Time, American Stars & Bars, and Old Ways). In my opinion he ruined an album that had tons of potential."
2,average filler Album,"Neil Young is a Talented Songwriter&Musician,but he has a tendency to release alot of so-so Projects from time to time&this is no exception. the lyrical Content&the overall Musical Feel here is very much on the safe territory that Eric Clapton long ago settled for.it can work for some artists,but it makes some others seem in need of trying to just release whatever as soon as Possible.very run of the mill Album here."
2,Startling,"I am being generous with my two stars, in deference to the man who wrote Harvest.Simply put, Neil needs a lyricist, and perhaps a muse. Listening to this, it seemed Neil looked around at what was clearly in view from his chair-his daughter, his guitar, his memory of the guy who sold him his ranch-came up with a tune and a hook, and then stuck with his first draft. In acting, they call this mailing it in, and Neil mailed these lyrics in-or at least that's the better view to the one that suggests he has become lyric-deaf after all his years.This could've been a four. It just needed some words."
4,Neil keeps on going,"Just finished listening to the CD my standouts are..It's a Dream, Far From Home. Check out the chord structure on This Old Guitar borrowed from Harvest Moon. As a previous reviewer stated it's just slightly better than Greendale, but not much."
4,"Good, but wish there were more upbeat tracks","This is the 1st Young album I've bought in many years. Probably the last thing I purchased by him was Re*Ac*Tor a long long time ago. ""Prairie Wind"" is a very nicely recorded and performed work, but some of it could have been better. Too many slow tunes. Tracks 8, 9 and 10 drag down the album, ""When God Made Me"" not a good way to end the CD, a faster more guitar-oriented track would have been a better closer. And that song about Elvis? Filler, very inane lyrics. Some electric guitar would have been nice too, although I suppose Neil's aim with this particular project was a full acoustic recording. I always loved all the great guitar on classic tracks such as ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Down By The River"" and many many others. I hope in the future, Young will someday go back to a straight rock & roll album. The same could be said for Sir Paul McCartney. Good new album but not enough rockers."
1,5.1?,"The amazon tech specs on regards the DVD is stupid and wrong. The disc isnt 5.1 at all, this should be changed. The music is top though"
4,Yes...I still listen to the tape!,"This was one of M.C. Hammer's many groups that he signed to his Bust It label. ""Spark of Love"" was the lead single. Great album! Where are these guys now? Very talented."
3,the alternative versions are great,BLOCKBUSTER ALTERNATE TAKES! will have you thinking that SWEET is back! Makes you remember the old albums with newer versions.
3,A little disappointed,"I picked up this book soley on recommendation of a friend and when I saw that it'd been given excellent reviews here on amazon, was expecting a grand novel. Instead, I found myself extremely irritated by Katherine and her weak demeanour and low self esteem. She's everything that as a woman, I strive not to be, so I had absolutely no respect for her or the story."
1,Kingdom of the Cults (Video),"This video is one of the worst excuses for a narrative on Cults that I have ever seen, period. Buy the book, it's ten times better!"
1,LIES!!,"All lies!! First off Wicca is a recognized religion by our government, it's not some scary Satanic organization as lead to believe by Christians. Wiccans or Witches if you prefer are not Christian, nor claim to be, yet Christian dieties are attached to them by Christians. Satan is a Christian diety.Second, Mike Warnke has been proven to be a liar, too bad people are still believing him. Have you read his book? It's a joke. Crazy thing is, Christians are that gullible. They've handed millions of dollars over if not to him, his publishers and his record company, because they bought into the lie.Think for youselves people. Do some research."
5,"Johnny Rawls, Soul Man, The Real Deal","For all you lovers of authentic rhythm and blues, who have had trouble finding the real thing among all the clutter of modern R&B, you need look no further than Johnny Rawls latest ""My Turn To Win"" on JSP records. This is pure soul music. The man can really deliver a song. Great lyrics, soulful and rhythmic. The make you want to dance kind of R&B, not this whiny stuff that is being overplayed today. Johnny Rawls is the real thing. With lyrics like this how can you lose, ""Yeah I like to look baby, But I don't touch,I'll stay by your side, cause I love you so much, when the sun goes down,and the day turns to night, just count on me baby, you know I'll make things right, and that's why nobody's gonna take your place"". Yeah that's right order a copy of this CD and you can get in the groove with Johnny Rawls too. He is my new favorite singer."
3,Okelah,"Film Triangle ini ceritanya sangat bagus namun tehnik sangat kurang (mungkin biaya2 sangat minim) sepertinya mengeluarkan biaya yang kecil menghasilkan uang yang besar, boleh dikatakan ini tidak bakal sukses dipasaran.Namun secara overall cukup okelah, dengan rating bintang 3 aza."
1,a waste of time,"I stuck it out for the entire movie hoping something in how it ended would make it worth watching the same scene play over and over again too many times. This was one of the most boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen. The last part is slightly more informative than the earlier repeats, so if you decide to watch this movie, save yourself and fast forward when the same events start happening a 2nd time, and go to about 10 or 15 minutes from the end and watch from there. You will miss nothing important and maybe you can make sense of it -- I couldn't."
1,Complete waste of time,"If you are the type of person that wants to feel good about yourself by making up some kind of meaning to this useless movie so that you feel smart, then you might like it. If you are the type of person who enjoys a movie because the writers actually wrote something worthwhile, look elsewhere."
5,excellent,This movie is great. It takes the old time line and twists it one more time. Its like Deception but with time. Pay attention so you don't miss the count.
1,Sucked,"This movie was so bad. Despite any lack of credibility on my part, take it or leave it, I can't in any form of the word consider this movie the slightest bit original, and at no point riveting. My compatriot and life partner both highly agree that any money spent in purchasing/renting this movie as well as time is very much wasted as if someone stared at a box of quaker oatmeal all day. Frankly i don't even think this movie deserves a review but I considered it my duty as an American citizen to let consumers know in this ever recessing economy to use their day and income a bit more wisely than I did today. Well... Enjoy!"
4,fantastic blind buy,went into this movie not knowing a thing about it. and was crazily surprised. it was soooo damn good. i enjoyed it a ton. altho i think the cover the movie is retarded since it will ruin a tad tad bit of the surprise. but push that aside and still it was damn good
4,A very well done movie!,It reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock/Twilight Zone/ Outer Limits fim. It really causes you to think and you find yourself rewinding the tape to see what clues you could have seen to alert you to the twist in the film.
2,hell is a bad movie on a loop,"this is an awful movie. around the 50 minute mark it started to give me a headache. the same actions are repeated over and over again with no explanations (or a lick of sense). finally (and inexplicably) the movie seems to end then start all over again. which i guess is the movie's point, HELL (or maybe life) is a bad movie on a loop. melissa george's good looks and ragged shirt are the movie's only redeeming features."
2,Ewwwww...,What the hell? Weird and beyond disturbing. I had trouble figuring this one out. Didn't care for this one at all.
2,"Good production values, but bad plot","I don't want to ruin the movie by revealing the plot, so all I can say is that if you get annoyed when a movie has large holes in logic, you might prefer to watch a different movie. Still, if you don't think too deeply about the basic premise of the plot it is an ok movie."
4,Good movie,"I like the actress and the movie, it slowly revealed what was happening. If you like quick action movie, this is not your type. Overall, a nice movie, watchable."
4,MIND GAMES,This psychological thriller is a mind-bending exercise in cinematic treachery. It's original and well done with an outstanding performance from Melissa George. Nothing is as it seems and you'll find yourself enthralled with its complexity. Go to the IMDB and the message board for this movie and you'll find some intriguing theories on the plotting. Certainly an above average thriller and well worth your time.
3,Not bad but also not logical,"As many go rounds as our heroine had to get things right, it seems to me that sooner or later she would have started using her brain. She was a blond though, so I guess that's the answer to that. Can't say much more without being a spoiler. I'd say it's worth watching if you want to kill some time."
1,You'll want to read this...,"Told the wrong way, this movie is like a joke. No wait. This movie is like a joke, told the wrong way. That pretty much sums up the reason this movie gets one star. It aspires to achieve an amazing effect, but if falls flat. The problem is with the mechanics of the script. And to all the viewers out there that left shinning reviews, you should change your name to Jack and lock yourself in a hotel."
1,Awful,"If you actually like intelligence with your horror movie, this is not one for you. Watch Silence of the Lambs, or the first Saw."
5,Perfect Gem of a Book!,"Fully half this book is made up of near photo quality full color full page plates showing synagogue details. Next best thing to a trip to Toledo in excellent resolution and color! The other half of the book is a clear written, informative text, translated to english by J. MacNab. If you are going to visit Toledo, and see these in person, this book won't get in the way; in fact if you have it along you will have more facts at your fingertips than most local guides could supply."
1,"Poorly researched, this book is a must-NOT Read.","No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary."
3,Convoluted caper.,"Kept Women Can't Quit contains plenty of typical Cool and Lam fare. Narrated by the diminutive PI, Donald Lam, this is a fast paced crime novel that revolves around two different but ultimately related crimes....an armoured car heist in Los Angeles and a fatal stabbing in San Francisco. Playing important roles are two seductive dames Hazel Downer and Evelyn Ellis, both of them rivals for the affection and fat bankroll of the same crooked guy.The plot is highly convoluted. Some passages make for interesting reading but a number of others are quite tedious because of the amount of detail author Erle Stanley Gardner insists on cramming in.Fast paced, interesting in places, but ultimately a rather mediocre read."
4,It kept me up all night!,"Loved it! I really enjoyed Philippa Gregory's ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". I got lost in the rivalry between Anne and Mary Tudor. I think Gregory painted a wonderful picture of the struggles they faced and the people they encountered. The conflicts of love, sex, and power kept me reading for hours at a time. The best part of this book was that it was a page-turner throughout; from the first chapter to the last page I was deeply entertained. If you are looking for a great historical fiction novel or just a fun read this is your book!"
5,Amazing book!,This is one of my favorites! What made it really intersting for me is that it is the first Historical Fiction book I have read. I was pulled in from the first page and felt like I was in the story. Philippa Gregory is a wonderful writer and I plan on reading many more of her wonderful books! I stayed up many late nights reading this book and I highly recommend it!
5,An amazing piece of history,"Having only recently delved into the historical fiction genre, but having been fascinated by England's monarchy for years, I couldn't put this book down! The historical accuracy of P. Gregory is astounding and, coupled with her fictionalized character traits, this book has become my favorite of the genre. Other authors have much to live up to after reading this Philippa Gregory novel. I can't wait to read more of her work!"
5,Without a doubt the best book i've ever read,"I have always been interested in the going on's in king henry's court. never had i come across the person, Mary Boleyn. The first thing that caught my attention was that it was a novel based on a real unheard of person. After beginning to read it, I was surprised to discover how her life was controlled. after being married to someone that her parents arranged for her she also becomes the king's mistress. Her second marriage is for love, leading to the disownment from her family. And all along you are getting views of the rising ambition of her older sister, Anne Boleyn. IN no other book can you get the feeling, fears, and dreams of the two boleyn sisters, and that hard fall that awaited them. you won't be able to put this down!"
5,Unbelievably engrossing...,"I have never, ever stayed up hours on end reading a book because I could not put it down...now, I have. This book is one of the most entertaining (while educating) works of historical fiction I have ever read. I just cannot say enough except to buy it and see for yourself."
1,Dumbest Book Ever,"This book is so bad it's virtually unreadable. Historical inaccuracies aside, this is simply a poorly written book. Please don't waste your money; hire any neighborhood 12 year old and they'll write a better book for you than this."
3,"Interesting, but not my favorite","This book was extremelllly long, and many times I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over. However, the storyline is pretty interesting. But I felt like I wanted to see more of ""the other boleyn girl"" 's life in the end. Everything seemed so drawned out during the novel and then its gets to the the end and you seem to only have the vague notion of how her life turned out. But, perhaps that is what the author wanted."
1,No Thanks,"For over a year this book has appeared on my screen as a recommendation and no amount of correspondence can get rid of it. I finally decided to buy it and donate it to Goodwill. Then, I thought maybe an honest review would get the thing off my screen. I found a used copy and hated it at less cost. It is not an historical novel, it is a romance in an historical setting - like a Disney cartoon treatment of Pocahontas."
5,A good read for historical fiction afficionadoes,"What can I write about this novel that hasn't been written before? I loved this novel, it was fascinating to read about the sister of such an infamous historical character, who so often gets passed over in the history books because of her famous sister. And the cover, the cover art is absolutely gorgeous."
3,It's okay,"Let me just say that I found this book to be a good ""fluffy"" read. I didn't love it, nor did I hate it--and I think that's because I kept wanting to slap the main charactor for being so weak willed. By the time I reached the end, I threw down the book and exclaimed, ""Well, it's about time!"" This book is a cross between Tudor England and Cosmo magazine: juicy with gossip but lacking any real depth. But, if you've got nothing better to do, and you happen to be a junkie for the Tudors...have at it!"
3,Just OK,"I liked the book at first, but it just seemed to drag endlessly in the middle. **SPOILER ALERT** I just got sick of hearing- summer- spent with the kids, god I love them. Fall- Anne's trying to get the king, but it falls through, summer- spent with the kids, god I love them, Fall- Anne's trying to get the king, etc etc. Also, I know she did not want to make Mary look perfect, but there seemed to be an emphasis on she's stupid, she's a whore, but everyone loves her because she is adorable. Anne was evil, manipulative, etc, to the point of being unbelievable or that I just didn't care anymore. The end might have been better than I think, but I found myself skimming it just to get it over with. Anyway, I can see where people would like the book, it just didn't do it for me."
3,gift book,i bouht this book s a gift for my daughter. she had seen the movie and wanted to read the book. according to her it as a good read.
4,Satisfying Page-Turner,"I usually avoid any novel that isn't properly considered literature, however every once in awhile I crave an escape that lingers without requiring much additional thought or 'unpacking' and The Other Boleyn Girl certainly hit the spot. The writing is simple and straight forward - nothing special - but the story is great (you can't make [most of] that stuff up!) and Gregory makes the characters truly compelling. I love how she shows the change in Henry VIII as he gets older and after his crippling leg injury. The Tudor period has always been fascinating to me, but her book actually renewed my interest and I have ordered books off of the bibliography Gregory included. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a satisfying page-turner."
4,Satisfying read,"I bought the book on a Friday afternoon and finished it in bed on Sunday night - as another reviewer said, don't let the size of the book put you off! This book was satisfying from a historical and fictional perspective without bogging down in the details that can stall a plot. I was very pleased with this book and plan to seek out other titles by this author. This book is the ultimate ""smart"" beach book."
3,Tedious,"I don't mind that there are historical inaccuracies in this book. The story is an interesting one that I enjoyed reading about. However, the book went on and on for so long about the story that it became dreadfully boring and tedious. This story could only capture my interest for 250 or so pages.The girls are fixated on their ambitious goals, they are shallow and vain, and they are treated terribly by men. Every now and then Mary's unique and good side comes out. Well so what. They are still boring and unlikeable.Why do people like reading this? Is it the sex? Is it the court? It is the same thing, page after page after page. The same thing happens during every meeting with the King, during every hunt with the King, during every glance at the Queen, during every secret family meeting. The only part I found interesting was the witchcraft and incest, which wasn't a large part of the book."
1,Disgustingly Inaccurate,"Gregory does admittedly have a wonderful writing style, which is what first attracted me to the book. The topic: Queen Elizabeth's mother. As I'm an avid reader of anything relating to Queen Elizabeht, I thought this book was a perfect find. Alas, the enchanting writing style of the first few pages falls flat when the historical inaccuracies can no longer be ignored. If you don't care what really happened FINE, but remember that this book and all the events are NOT what happened. If you enjoy historical novel at all, this book is not for you!"
1,boring...,"i found this book disappointing... after reading a comment about it being historically inaccurate, i realize that i agree-but not for the reason you might think....when i wasnt even halfway done with the book i read a cool fact ruining the story... the fact stated that Anne was Henrys wife. it also stated that Anne had an extra finger on her left hand, something not mentioned in the book..."
3,"Entertaining, manipulative rendering of characters and history.","The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling story and it is easy to see why it is so successful. I felt caught up in the court life during Henry VIII's reign. My biggest problem is the heavy-handed treatment of the characters - Anne Boleyn is too ruthless and ambitious; Mary is just too good; Henry is one-dimensional. The history license taken is considerable but not surprising given the premium placed on writing a juicy tale.In spite of books shortcomings, I enjoyed this as a guilty pleasure. I will probably check out other works by Gregory from my local library. I would rather spend my money on books by writers like Roberta Gellis or Sharon Kay Penman because they write higher quality historical romances."
5,Every page is an adventure,"I absolutely LOVED this book! Extremely long books like this one (661 pages) usually turn me off, but each and every page of THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is an adventure within itself. Filled with mystery, tragedy, injustice, scandal, romance, heartbreak, and even the occasional touch of humor, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL provides an intimate and colorfully detailed portrait of life in Henry VIII's court over a period of 15 years. I was absolutely riveted and couldn't bear to put this book down until I reached the end. Now I want Philippa Gregory to write Elizabeth's story!"
3,"A fun read, but not much more than that","The Other Boleyn Girl is a fun read. Don't have your expectations too high; this is more like a romance novel than historical fiction. I couldn't let the book go while I was reading it, but I didn't have any urge to pick it up again once I finished it.Mary Boleyn, the narrator of the book is portrayed as everything her scheming sister is not. Her personality is inconsistent - the author tried to make her torn between playing the role of ""Boleyn girl"" and just a girl who wants to live a happy, simple life; but I don't think that inner struggle was presented well enough - and as you can expect, while Anne gets her head chopped off by the brat king, Mary gets a good-looking, handsome, and caring man."
2,Historical Fiction Overdone!,"With an emphasis on the ""fiction"" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short. I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well, historical!"
4,Tale of Two Sisters,"I finally got round to the book that began a whole sub-genre: and put headless robed women on the covers of a thousand novels. This is a tale of two sisters, b%#chy Anne and her unfortunate sister who gets to deal with her famous sibling. Of course we all know the ending, but England comes alive in ways it didn't in 10th grade history. Also gave a copy as a gift, and my friend enjoyed it as well."
2,Finally finished it,"I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative. And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness. This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on. Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author."
1,A novel for the intellectually challenged,"Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will, after reading--or trying to read--THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a ""dime novel""-that pejorative characterizing hack writing, which in our time is seen most often in historical romances-novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is such a novel. In our time of computers, the internet and blogs, the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques. It's a world where lies flourish, and publications such as ""Publishers Weekly"" with their fatuous critiques, become co-conspirators in this deception."
3,Like the little details of court life,"Gregory brings the Tudor Court alive in The Other Boleyn Girl. Very well researched, she sprinkles the text with little details about fashion, buildings and even flowers that take you back to the 16th century."
3,A lot of fun,I love Henry vIII and had a blast reading this book. It's historical fiction done for the post-millenium crowd and definitely good beach reading!
5,Excellent book.,"I couldn't put it down. Entertaining, historical (though potentially not entirely accurate)...honestly, I loved this book."
4,An enjoyable read,"Last week I finished reading The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory. I really enjoyed it. Historical fiction is not a genre I often read, and I picked up this novel for my Kindle on a whim. I'm very glad I did - the characters are well-rounded and realistic (especially Mary, who we watch progress from a naive child to mature woman of the court), the volatile tempers of Henry and Anne are beautifully described, and I found myself drawn in to the entire court setting and all of its various players.As for length, I'd have to say it could have lost maybe 100 or so pages without hurting the story. I thought the middle chapters paled in comparison to the first and last third. Still, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys courtly intrigues and politics."
4,History? No. Fun? Yes.,"I think there's been enough debate within these reviews that Philippa Gregory's novel is not the most historically accurate and presents a biased view against Anne Boleyn that probably isn't true. I'm in agreement there. But I still give this book 4 stars because at its heart it's a fictional romance novel. Dare I say a ""trashy romance novel""? It's a good read. And relatively quick given it's 660 pages. I refer to it as ""trashy"" (in a good way) because there are some parts that are better read on a weekend beach blanket than on your bus ride to work.If you're in to Tudor history, this is not the book for you. But a good summertime read? When I finished it, I passed it to my friend on the beach blanket to the left."
2,not as advertised,"I ordered the DVD from Amazon based on the description given. The DVD I received did not contain the original version of the film, as was advertised, only the black & white version. This quote is from the Amazon.com description; ""This DVD does not provide a working replica of the Illusion-O viewer (earlier copies did), but it offers both a straight, black-and-white version of the feature (no viewer necessary) and a version with the film's original tinted scenes requiring the viewer for extra fun. Also included is Castle's own introduction, in which he explains the Illusion-O technique. --Tom Keogh"". I don't care about the viewer, I'm interested in the original tinted scenes."
3,Keep the remake.,"It was all smoke & mirrors anyway (pun definitely intended), and ultimately boring. The original, in all its cheesy glory, actually offers some OK acting here and there and a few genuinely creepy moments."
4,a classic ghostly horror flic,"i remember as a child of 9 the first time my friends and i went to see this movie it left a lasting impression. i went home that night and certainly did not want to take my 3d viewer with me. ive always been a lover of horror movies but for some reason that one stuck. then when the new one came out so many years later, i couldnt wait to go see it, and ended up quite disappointed ! if they would of kept the same storyline and left out the r rated features, and left in the fright, it would of been 100 per cent better. i would certainly enjoy another remake sticking to more of the old classic film."
2,Cheesy,They aren't what I expected. Looks they are made kinda cheesy.Expected a little better quality. Would not recommend to buy.
1,"So far, so bad","I used this to refill an HP brand cartridge. It worked fine for awhile, but after a few days, my printer stopped working--showed as being offline. After unplugging it for several hours and rebooting my system, it printed exactly one page and stopped working again. I bought another new HP cartridge and everything was fine again once I installed it. The clerk at Staples told me horror stories about how bad these refill kits are, but I took those with a grain of salt. When this cartridge is empty, I will try again."
5,"4 buck for a ""new"" cartridge","Easy to use. Learning curve is no problem, take your time the first time, no problem. The next refills will be brain-dead. Re-fills for under 4 bucks. Also, I ""heard online"" that you can buy bulk ink (ebay carries) and refill your refill system, so you can even get your next refills less expensively. At some point you do have to buy an OEM cartridge as they are not infinitely refillable."
5,Flawless,"Worked perfectly from the start. Simple. Clean. No hassle. Pay close attention to instructions regarding using pump to stimulate ink flow, and avoid refilling a cartridge which has been empty for some time (it has dried up and may not refill properly). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the calibration marks on the ink tank serve as an excellent guide to monitor how much ink has gone into the cartridge.Construction quality is very precise... much better than I would have expected for a product of this nature. This product will save HUGE dollars over feeding HP their profit gouging prices for OEM. Hooray!"
5,Great product,I love this product. It is so much easier to use and less messy than other ink refills I have tried.
5,How to reduce work on the problem sets,"After reading the other reviews on this excellent book, I would comment that the exercises can be reduced to short work by use of Mathematica to run the integrations, etc."
2,Brevity a serious problem.,"There a several things I have come to dislike about this book. The first is in the overall treatment of the subject matter. The explanations are incomplete and sometimes you can be left wondering how one equation follows from another. Griffiths also introduces symbols or notations without giving a formal definition of what it is. As a result of this, reading the actual text is usually of no help when it comes to solving the more difficult problems. It is infuriating to look at a problem for over three hours and still have absolutely no clue as to how to go about solving it. I have no problem with very difficult problems that take hours, but I would like to spend the time actually working on the problem, instead of staring at it, wondering where to start or what that notation means that the author never defined. Not recommended."
2,"Recommended for some, strongly discouraged for others","I first saw this book as a graduate student. Some fellow students had used this book as an undergraduate text. With all due respect to said fellow students, they have barely the ability to articulate the most simple statements of Quantum Mechanics. If you're goal is to have a basic understanding of the machinary and principles of Quantum Mechanics, then buy either Liboff or Landau.That being said, I could see how this book could have its uses. If youA) do not understand linear algebra.B) do not understand differential equations.C) have fond memories of 3rd grade math.D) would like to impress your friends with the uncertainty principle.then buy this book."
5,A well written elementary QM text.,"David Griffiths concentrates on the classic and important QM proplems, such as the Schrodinger equation, the finite square well, the delta function potential, the hydrogen atom, spin, etc. He does not touch on QM ""side line"" issues. Thus the students efforts are most efficient. Griffiths develops each subject in a balanced and easy to understand way. His book could be home studied without assistance from an instructor, which is certainly not true of many QM texts. The exercises are well selected and appropriate, and many of them have implicit or explicit answers provided. Along with QM by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, I would rate this one of the best choices for the beginning student. While Cohen-Tannoudji is comprehensive and elegant, Griffiths is basic and focused."
3,Didn't like it,"I didn't like it for nursing. I could never get it to sit right or feel comfortable using it. However, my daughter used it a lot as a back rest when she was learning to sit up and likes to use it now (at 22 months old) for watching t.v. or playing with her dolls. I'd suggest trying it out in the store to see if you like it before spending the $$."
1,buy a cheaper one,"This is a good pillow if you do NOT plan to breastfeed. The pillow doesnt stay around your waste if you want to sit comfortably. I find that in order to breastfeed my son i have to lean foreward so far that it hurts. It is just too bulky and firm for brestfeeding. The star is for helping my son sit up. However it does tend to slide back away from him. This pillow is also too bulky for tummy time. My advice is to buy a cheaper one if you feel you need one. Or buy one with toys attached, even better is the gym model, which I plan to get after I return this useless pillow. Think about this: $34 for about $3 worth of material and stuffing."
1,Worst Nursing Pillow Ever,"I read all the great reviews and tried this as a nursing pillow. It was horrible! It was large and cumbersome and too low for me. Because my baby was constantly tugging my nipples down I was cracked and bleeding for two months. I finally put it in the closet thinking I could at least use it when he started sitting up. I think he sat in it about 5 times before he could sit up on his own so I was disappointed I had wasted the closet space storing it. After talking to my girlfriends I found out that everyone GETS a boppy but most people don't actually use them. They just don't bother to post reviews! If you need a nursing pillow there are lots of other ones out there, just not at BRU!"
3,"Good product, but not as I originally thought","I read many reviews before registering for the Boppy, and was looking forward to using it with my newborn. Well, she is 7 weeks old now, and I have hardly used it as a nursing pillow. I've found that it doesn't fit around me (I'm not a big person) and the edges of the pillow sit to the sides of my legs and dip down. This makes it very hard to position her while nursing. The pillow also does not fit around me when I'm sitting in my glider.But I do like the pillow for using it to prop up my little one. At our house, we call it the baby recliner. She seems to love it. The pillow keeps her proped up a bit so she can look around, and it hugs her to make her feel comfy. I also think I will use the pillow when she begins to sit by herself."
3,Nice but not comfortable...,This pillow was nice & did help a bit with breastfeeding but always slipped during the feeding. Fabris was soft & durable for our son when he was learning to sit & start to move during first couple months. More useful for child support than breastfeeding...
2,Not great for Breast Feeding,I had a boppy with my 1st child and found it hard to use. It kept popping out of place when breast feeding. A friend then loaned me her breast friend which I loved!!! I will definitely be getting one of those this time around. I would like to get the boppy for tummy time and when baby is learning to situp by himself.
5,Boppy from Heaven,"We purchased the Boppy Luxe just before the arrival of our little one. My husband was skeptical, and thought the price was a little high. But, after spending three days in the hospital holding, feeding, and rocking our baby, we both had some sore shoulder and arm muscles. When we got home, I placed the boppy in his lap -- his first words were ""Ahhhh. This was the best investment we have ever made."" We use the boppy at every feeding, as it makes holding baby much easier. Plus, the boppy is comfortable for baby. We highly recommend the boppy luxe."
3,two pillows will do,My son is 7 months and I am still breast feeding him. I have only used the boppy pillow a couple of times. I find it a lot easier to use two pillows to prop him up high enough to breast feed.
1,Don't really get it...not useful for us at all!,"I breastfed my daughter until she was a year old and found the Boppy to be pretty much useless. It wasn't the right height for nursing for me and I preferred to use a smaller pillow which conformed to my daughter's body better.We used it once or twice for sitting up, but most of the time, she was supported by my legs or multiple pillows. I think this is one of those products that's either love/hate--for us, it has to be the latter!"
1,A HUGE disappointment,I registered for a Boppy pillow with the hopes that this pillow would enhance my breastfeeding experience. The bottom line is that it simply does not help. It is awkwardly shaped and does not facilitate an easy latch for new Moms who have never breastfed before. It's also super bad for little babies like mine.I would NOT recommend this pillow.
4,Love it!,"We received this as a shower gift for our son. I started out breastfeeding, but later, due to medical reasons, had to bottle feed. It works wonderfully for both! The baby is very comfortable, and, if you place baby just right, it leaves mom with an empty hand! Awesome if you are trying to eat at the same time, or just want to read a magazine...just be sure that baby is stable. : ) We also use this for tummy time. I can't wait until he is trying to sit up...it will be used for that, too! I love products that more than one purpose!!!"
3,harmless and sweet,Can't see what all the complaining is about..it's a nice little film. Not great in anyway but sort of sweet. How many films about flower gardening are there in the world.Clive Owen lends his studliness to what would otherwise be bland.
2,The Princess of Dhagabad,Could not really get interested in this book. Really don't care for trilogies. Couldn't get into the theme. Sorry. Maybe next time.
3,fine,"What my teacher does is she'll have us read a book and then if there's a movie version she allows us to view it. i actually hated until the last page. it was touching though when the soldier came at the end. although people made fine it a boring ang intolerable read, i thought the movie was fabulous, and since i was with two of my friends at the time, i had fun."
2,Boring!,This story happens very slowly and painfully. It is the most boring story I have ever read in my entire life. Some of the characters who are meant to be important are never really developed such as Simon and Roger. The only thing that makes this book possibly worth reading is the fact that it is very short and that the symbolic meaning is important and interesting. The message of this story is that we could not survive with no rule. We would become savages. I would not reccomend reading this classic.
5,A Classic Novel Not To Be Missed.,"Lord of the Flies is as critically important today as when it was first published. A brilliant novel that deserves to be read as soon as a young adult can comprehend its prose (hopefully, by age 12), the novel commands the attention of readers of all ages. It should be on every student's reading list, and every adult's, as well."
2,This book is evil!,"We read this book in my seventh grade advanced English class last year, and I hated it. The story is this: a group of English schoolboys get shipwrecked on an island, and eventually go crazy and kill each other. It was just evil. The one boy, Ralph, who is the ""main character"" of the book, has very few faithful followers. His rival, Jack, has a much larger group of followers - and they think there is a ""beast"" on the island. To lure it (to try to capture it), they kill a pig and put its head on a stick. This becomes the ""Lord"" of the flies, because so many flies crawl in and out of its disgusting, dead eyes (or holes where the eyes WERE), nose, and mouth. I couldn't believe this book when I read it, and no one on earth could persuade me to read it again. Ewww."
4,Interesting Symbolism...,"As I began to read this book, I was completely bored. I had to stick with it because it is required to read. Good thing I did; I started to see the symbolism in the story, instead of just a book about kids stuck on an island.""Lord of the Flies"" basically means ""The Lord of all Evil"", and that is conveyed extremely well in this book."
3,The lord of the flies,"The book, the Lord of the Flies was a decent book to me, but not one of my favorites. I loved the story line but the book was slow often times and I had to make myself keep reading until something interesting happened again. The author was very descriptive so I would not reccomend this book for those that don't have a high attention span. Overall it was a good book but, as I said,it is not among my favorites."
3,This book was OK,"This book has a great plot, a group of shipwrecked boys gone wild, killing multiple people. I liked the book except for one major part, the book was Extremely descriptive. Whole pages would be devoted to describing the island scenery before anything actually happened."
2,An Okay Book!,I just read this book under Bloom's Notes. It began very boring so I didn't want to continue reading it. It was an okay book I would say if you like that type of literature. The most interesting part of the book was the barbarous man hunt
5,Most Interesting Novel,"Lord of the Flies is a very interesting novel. It is thrilling and full of suspense. The novel is about some boys stranded in an island and becoming savages. When I finished the novel I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept on thinking of how some of the boys survived. They had what they needed to survive, a signal, hunters for food, and shelters. They had no adults around to take care of them. Some of them were trying really hard to get allong and follow the rules that they had made for themselfs. But in a story there is always someone who doesn't like to go with the rules. Later on the boys become savages and fight against each other. This novel made me understand how important it is to have an adult around and what their knowledge can bring. I really enjoyed this novel and I know that anyone can enjoy it too."
4,Crazed Kids Chasing Pigs!,"This book was quite interesting. It made for great debates, numerous conversations, and a laugh for everyone in my small english class. For a mandatory book it was worth my time, obviously, but I did find small inklings of spirituality and realism held within the pages of this book pages. To keep this short and sweet: If its mandatory, read it and then complain. If you're lookin' for a good book: keep lookin', but I will say this, ""Lord of the Flies"" allows a very interesting point of view on life and the world. The step from a small world of kids warring against each other, into a larger world of adults doing the same: warring. The loss of innocense could have been portrayed in 5 pages or less, but the author drags it out in a dramatic way making it all the more prone to being criticized."
1,Please!,"We had to read this book in English. The book is not at all suitable for us kids. For one, it is boring, and for two, the book has profanity, and it keeps on saying the same stuff over and over and over again."
1,Lord of the Flies,"I hated this book!! It was boring and violent. I didn't want to read it at all, but I had to for school. I had two weeks to read it and I thought, 'oh no problem'. I could hardly sit and read this book for five minutes!! I will never read this book again."
2,OK...,"I didn't paticularly enjoy Lord of the Flies, but I must admit, it was fairly interesting... Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society, and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong, order and chaos, and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society, or in other words, that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought, one that I do in a way stand behind, but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me, so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding."
1,An unbelievable waste of time.,"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."
2,Not very realistic,"I must say, the book was very well written, but the plot was totally unrealistic. After being on the island for only about a year (assuming that is how long, with the change of seasons) these proper British boys turn into bloodthirsty savages. I understand them doing stuff they would not normally be allowed to do, but to murder someone the way Roger did? I strongly believe something like that would never happen in real life."
3,The Lord of the Flies,"The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked, sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however, the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort, while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control."
2,totally unbelievable,"this book, while trying to simulate a society of youths thrown together in unusual circumstances, is simply too far-fetched to work. the psychological component would not be present without a string of huge coincidences that cannot be taken seriously (im talking about the parachuter on the top of the mountain, among others). i continually found myself comparing lotf to animal farm by george orwell, another ""simulated society"" novel. the latter is by far more convincing, even if its main characters are nothing but common barnyard animals."
1,"Yow! Lots of people wrote stuff, huh?","This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies."
2,BORING!!,"This book can be summed up in one word: BORING. Don't buy it unless you have to for school, even then I wouldn't open it. Read the cliff notes- it's less painful."
1,Disgusted,"I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children."
4,Wasted on schoolkids,"William Golding's first novel has been read, most probably by most people, when they were at school as Lord of the Flies has long been a staple text of GCSE English classes. As a result many people read it at an age where they are filleting its pages for 'symbols' to be reprocessed in exam answers, and sniggering at innuendos such as blowing the conch.All of which is a shame, as Lord of the Flies articulates a theme of the innate savage just under the surface of civilized man. A trope that has spawned a thousand imitators in films and books since, but Golding's novel was probably the first. Beginning as a deceptively simple fable about some well educated British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash, the allegorical story traces their descent into frenzied barbarisim.Golding himself was a schoolmaster for a number of years, and he knows exactly what boys are like. If they are not strictly regulated and controlled, chaos is the inevitable result."
1,Brilliantly memorable,"Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think, as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been, that it's an overblown, overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works, such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to, harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because, psychologically, the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand, Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read."
3,"This book started a little boring, later it gets exciting.","Lord of the flies helps you understand almost everything about humans and human nature. It seems to be a great book, although it is rather boring at the beginning of the book. But as you continue to read the boring book that you just picked up suddenly turns into an excitingly brutal story.Other than that I can't say much about the book because I have yet to finish it.You'll also see how brilliantly descriptive William Golding is."
2,I have mixed feelings about this book.,"In the book, I have mixed feelings. The first thing that I feel towards this book is that I don't like it. I thought it was more of a boy's type book that was really hard for me to understand. I thought it was very confusing and complicated. As I continued to read the book, it began to make more sense. As you read it, you learn what the main concept is of the book. The main concept is that if you live for awhile without someone watching over you, you begin to become a savage. This is especially bad for young boys. Then I began to like the book a little bit. I liked it because it taught a valuable lesson to the readers and to the boys that were on the island. It taught them that to survive you have to work together as a team. It also teaches the readers how cruel the world can be. This is an okay book once you look at the whole picture."
5,A teachers point of view,"This past year I taught in a rural school, so I had the opportunity to choose what literature I wanted my students to read. I had 3 eighth grade boys, and chose to have them read this novel. The boys loved it, but on the other hand, we read most of it together in a group, because some of the wording was a little 'over their heads'. All in all, I find this to be one of the greatest classics ever written, and would suggest handing it to any young adult that's looking for a little enlightenment and a great read."
2,my opinion of Lord of the Flies,My opinion of the book is that i didnt like it as much and that it didnt pull me in to want to keep reading it.If you like action and like story lines where theres a fight for survival than you would probably enjoy Lord of the Flies.In the story you will see a group of kids that are stranded on a island and theres problems and many adventures that take place and if u want to find out more you'll have to read it for yourself.I wouldn't recommend this book because it wasn't exciting as much and i wanted to stop reading it becasue it was a waste of time for me.This is my opinion for my point of veiw of the book but its up tp you and hope you mgiht enjoy it or not.
4,Modern classic and thought-provoking,"This book is where ""Survivor"" got the idea, however turn that towards pre-adolescents without the control of any rules or authority. Chaos, fear, blood-bath. Written after WWII, and loaded with symbolism and comments about civilization and violence, the only criticism that really bugged me on the book is that there are no girls or females on the island; how can you realistically have a society, or critique mankind and exclude the other half?"
5,An Excellent Book,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. The writing is beautiful, the story is captivating.Too bad the ending is so sad."
2,a conventional view of mankind,"this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result."
2,Lord of the Flies gathers flies,This book is way overrated. The writing and the way the author tells the tale is average at best. I had heard that this book is a must read. I do not understand that point of view as I had to force myself to finish the book. I was very bored with it.
1,Not wild about American literature.,"I'm not a fan on American lit! To be truthful, when I had to read it in college, I did the Cliff Notes, and even THAT was B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!. I have tried reading it twice and don't make it past the first two pages. The movie? NOT!!! Don't go by me, though. Some things have got to be read. My American Lit. professor loved it. To each his own."
2,its a school reading project,"At a time when the baby boomer's were yet to exist, WW2 was happening. A school of boys are stranded on an island due to a plane crash with no adult anywhere. The leader Ralph created 2 teams to survive each having a certain task. Jack becomes the hunter team, while Ralph was more of the society creation team. Ralph's second had man, Piggy, helps out in more than a few ways untill tradgity strikes. The teams divide as the socity clapes and roles are broken. WIlliam Golding has created another timeless piece, full of changes and plot twists in ""lord of the Flies""."
1,We did not find it that interesting. It was not the best bo,"This book was a boring book. We found it hard to stay awake while reading it. The descriptions were extremely vague and this resulted in unclear pictures of the surroundings. Even though this book is considered a ""classic"" we thought that it should not have generated the responses it did from the public."
1,"Should be ""Lord of Boredom!""","The book went to slow for me. The way the boys on the island carried on about a ""beast"" that wasn't there, wasn't action enough fo me. I need more information on the characters themselves, to get really envolved in the book. The book doesn't describe the boys very well. I also don't agree with the author's view of humanity. The was the boys acted was more the ways of young boys, rather than humanity as a whole."
5,More than just a book,"William Golding wrote this book as a response to ""Coral Island,"" in which a group of boys shipwrecked on an island make Christians out of cannibals, hunt pigs but do not spill blood, and are cheerfully rescued. Obviously, Lord of the Flies is much more than an adventure story about good little boys. It is an exploration into the darker side of man and the true source of the ""beast,"" or Devil.Meet Ralph, who represents sanity, common sense, and the conscience of man; Jack, who loves nothing more than hunting, blood, and power, and who Freudians might say embodies the Id; Piggy, who personifies intelligence, logic, and reason; and Simon, who discovers the true nature of the beast and represents a ray of hope for mankind.I love this book because contained in less than 200 pages is an insight into human nature and the failings of society. When you read this, be prepared not only to examine the book and all its symbolism but yourself and your civilization."
2,Excellent story - not sure about the narrator...,"If I were scoring the story, it would have 5 stars. Unfortunately this reading by the author isn't all that great. For one, it's dated and the audio quality suffers from that. There is no consistency in the sound so one minute he sounds okay and the next as though he's stepped away from the microphone. Another annoying factor is the breathing and sighing while he's reading making the whole thing sound like a chore. It's a pity because this is an excellent story but the narration could use improvement."
5,I loved this book.,"I'm sure this review won't get any ""helpful"" votes, but here are my thoughts. Somehow, this book wasn't required reading in any of my high school or college classes, so I had no idea what it was about when I picked it up (on a flight on my honeymoon, no less). I thought it was a great read. I'm not one to get into allegorical type books or story lines, but this one was good. The author did a great job of presenting a microcosm of the best and worst sides of human behavior, or so I thought. I thought the final page ended the book perfectly. The kids get rescued from completely destroying themselves by adults, who are in fact part of a much larger world/society/culture trying to, well, destroy each other. Perfect ending."
5,Lord of the Flies,This book was written excellentally by Golding expressing the overall problems of society. The destruction of innocence and rationality helps to improve his theme. The overall twists in the plot and storyline make it an enjoyable read.
4,The Children Version of Lost,"William Golding's novel of a couple of young boys trapped on an island after a terrible plane crash is an exciting suspenseful mystery filled with lots of action. It all starts when a young boy named Ralph sets out to search the island for any other people. He finds a boy named Piggy (a boy from the same plane crash) and a couple of other boys. Everything seems fine on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a beast. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the TV show Lost. It presents some of the same themes in the book that are in Lost, except the characters in the novel are between the ages of 6-12. I recommend this book to anyone who loves suspenseful books filled with a lot of action."
4,Lord of the Flies by Nate(DINGBAT),"This spectacular classic demonstrates the state of nature when a group of young boys crash on a desolate island in the middle of the ocean in the 1950's. The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great thriller that tells a story of how power can overcome a soul and how quickly horrible things can happen. After happiness and hope turn to violence, Ralph is left with no power and turned against by his friends and hunted down.I thought this book was incredible because of the characters and how they acted on the island. I began to wonder what it would be like to live on an island with forty other kids my age and no adults, I came to the conclusion that it would be terrible and it would be grand chaos. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults over the age of twelve because it has very intense action and hard language for a small child to understand."
3,Pretty Good,"I read this book in high school and didn't like it at first because it was a little tough for me and the attempts to get off the island seemed to drag on to the point where I no longer cared if they got off the island at all but then I read it again and seemed to like it. It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as ""beasts"" I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it."
2,Not everything gets better with age...,"And definitely not Lord of the Flies. While it might have some important messages and symbolism, it is all buried too deep between the lines. It projects the problems of society onto a group of boys plane wrecked on an abandoned island; in the beginning they all attempt to survive and use the resources that are available, but as they continue to be marooned on the island, their little society becomes corrupted as they become violent and manipulative. The multiple plots, many characters, and headache-inducing descriptions all made this book tedious and unpleasant to read, especially since I had to do so unwillingly for school. I found the fact that the author had to use symbolism for every point he wanted to make, such as the boys turning into monsters, and the pig's skull, got really tiring and boring to read. While this book is considered a classic and I suppose it has its relevancy after all these years, I would not reccomend wasting your time on it."
2,Hated it,"Hated it - really boring. The only reason I didn't give it a one, is because it portrays what I see as an accurate description of what could happen given this situation."
4,your idealism will rest uneasy perhaps....,"...after you read this classic tale of shipwrecked boys degenerating into polarizations of acted-out good and evil. ""The beast is us."""
4,"symbolism, and descriptions.","Golding is an exquisite writer. He uses symbolism to describe the fact that there is evil in everyone. He also uses symbolism to describe fear and anger. He provokes the mind to think that they are in the story by using descriptions. Although some aspects of this book were unbelievable, it could happen. I personally see only two flaws in the book. The first being that everything needs to be more innnocent in the beginning so that when drastic changes come they are extremely drastic. The second being that the book goes very slowly, almost too slowly. However, overall it was an excellent book. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies."
5,Totally Worth it!,"The book actually came in a day early, which was awesome. I bought it because I read this book in my Freshman year of high school and I'm now in my Freshman year of university so I felt like rereading it. Excellent quality and shipping! I would definitely order from here again."
2,shocking,I was shocked by this book and dont think that it deservs the accolades that has been given. Students reading this would need to be very well balanced and well councelled.
3,"Good, but not great.","Okay, so this book is recommended. Exciting, but boring at times. The beginning was very boring, and it stayed that way until pretty far into the book. The excitement level went up and down after the beginning. (The end was very exciting.) (Spoiler alert!) The book ended very suddenly. That was a flaw that really bothered me. (End of spoiler!) This book was very intense towards the end. The kids are a little bit dumb. Except for a few of them.(No offense.) But it had great impact on the excitement, so I can not call that a flaw. (Even though I was about to a second ago.) This book is pretty good. Check it out!"
4,"Lord of the Flies, A Society Eye Opener","This book in my opinion is a decent book for a adventure sotry or for a exotic novel. But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the ""beast"" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart. I hope you liek this book and I think you would enjoy reading it."
2,Novel review of the Lord of the Flies,"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names."
2,Utterly Disturbing,"Lord of the Flies is a menacing look at the true nature of man, or the author's idea of it. I found it an unbelievably shallow look at the human spirit. Just thinking of this book at night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep. I think Golding's work is overly unsensitive, although it makes you think about yourself and what you would do in that situation. If you would do the same hideous things that the boys wind up resulting to."
3,never received half the order but paid for shipment to be overnighted,I ordered Lord of the Flies for my daughter that needed the book and notes. I paid 27 dollars to ship it overnight. I received the book 7 days later and never received the notes. I was never refunded my money for the notes or shipping. My daughter had to borrow them from a classmate.
4,Takes a while,"I read this book for 10th grade summer reading, and I never encountered a book I hated before this. Golding seemed to have no idea what he was talking about either let us know by describing objects as ""stuff"" or by losing us in run-on descriptions. But after discussing this book and rereading it for my test tomorrow, I've realized the full potential of this book. I didn't know a short book could take so long to read, but read it, then go and analyze it. You'll end up loving it!"
5,Awsome,This book was very well writen and was worth my money.It was an good book about survival and it shows how people really act without rules or laws to live by.
3,Good Book,"Golding's Lord Of The Flies begins with a plane crash on an island somewhere in the ocean. A group of boys ranging in age survived and have no adult supervision. The children learn to survive, yet one boy always disagrees with their choosen leader Ralph. Jack, the boy that sees a need to disagree, starts his own hunting tribe. These boys become savages and do what they want to at any given time. The message to human kind is hidden behind a story about boys surviving, but it is revealed by the use of symbolism and that is why this book is fun to read."
2,this book is boring...,"if ur a kid going to highscool and you have to read this book for school be warned that its BOOORRRIIINNGG. its weird and nothing cool happens the first 110 pages. some parts are ok but its mostly a crazy story. i wish i didnt have to read this crap over the summer, not to mention the friggin homework that comes with it."
2,Savages,"This book taught: That you cannot socialize savagery out of a person, children are reflection of the adults in their community, laws cannot hold people together, and more."
5,CLASSIC FOREVER,"Lord of the Flies is a novel filled with imagery. Probably the most significant of these symbols was the conch. The conchs characterized several things, including independence and stability on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, harmony between the boys. One of the most motivating characteristics to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a deficiency of control or power on Piggy's part. As the tale progressed, this routine shrank more and more, until the isle was a dwelling of broad chaos and mayhem.I love its break down and build up in society. I love books like this and enjoy the psychological thinking that must be modified in order to do this. I find as I grow older the simple way a belief system can be created in a community...is fascinating. Lord of the Flies is THE most classic example of this procedure."
1,this book was really boring,"I hated this book, along with my other book i had to read this summer. I hope my english teacher spares the boredom on the 6th graders that are going to have to read this. It was page after page of boring descriptions. I really didn't want to read it...but i didn't want to get an F on my test. THIS BOOK IS NOOOOOOT RECOMMENDED"
1,it the most stupid book i've ever read,"It is not only stupid and senseless through out all the book, but it has a very stupid ending I don't know who could write such a bad book, you have to be mess up."
1,The most hopeless book I have ever read,"I really don't know what kind of criteria this book met to receive as much acclamation over the years as it has, it is the absolute worst book I've ever read. Pessimistic, cynical, jaded and completely blind to the truth of the human condition, Golding uses this book as an opportunity to highlight the worst part of the human condition. Golding's message that mankind is imprisoned by civilization, and once we are freed from it we will return to ""savage"" roots is baseless and nihilistic. Save yourself the agravation and do not read this book. If you are looking for a cautionary tale of some sort, read 1984 by George Orwell or anything other than this insulting piece of overrated literature."
5,A Masterpiece,"This novel is unquestionably my favorite book. I enjoyed every minute of the text, and enjoyed analyzing it even more. With highlighter and marking pen in hand i went page by page and discovered the true depth of William Golding's writing in the tale of a band of young and adolescent boys whose plane crashes onto an uncharted island, and in the absence of adults they create their own world complete with government, conflict, and even bloodshed. In this ultimately dark novel, one witnesses Golding's unparalleled talent in storytelling as a means of intelligent propaganda, the story itself being a microcosm of the world war that was going on at the time. It's a fascinating read, whether you choose to read it for its deepest meaning or its most simple.I highly reccommend reading this book. Though a mere high school senior, as a well-read student/bookworm I have not been met with any classic or modern novel that has captivated me with every word in the way this novel has."
3,The Lord of the Flies,"The book Lord of the Flies by William Golding is one of Golding's best books. It is about a group of British boys who get stranded on an island. At first the boys have good intentions, but as time passes those intentions change and they break up into 2 groups the fire-watchers which are led by Ralph and the hunters led by Jack. Ralph who becomes good friends with Piggy thinks more about being rescued and setting up sort of a community. Jack and the hunters on the other hand think more about getting meat and themselves. This book not only tells an exciting adventure story, though, it also describes on a deeper level, the thin line between civility and insanity, and how young children can become insane without some amount of authority and discipline."
2,Lord of the Flies,"I didn'tlike this book this book that much,and i dont think I'll read it again.I didn't like Lord of the Flies that much beacause some parts were kinda confusing and boring to me. Lord of the Flies is about a group of kids that get stranded on a island and start a tribe with a boy named Ralph as there leader and have to survie on this island. I would give this book 2 stars beacause i thought the book was confusing and boring in some parts. I would not recommend this book."
4,"Brilliant, except for the bit where Corelli fails to return","It was all exceptionally well written. But in all honesty a man who had fallen so much in love with Pelagia and who had gone through so much with her and with her family and friends etc, would not have returned just for a glimpse of her only to disappear for 30 years...that was unrealistic. If it had been me I would have run over to her and embraced her!!"
4,Cover,The GPS cover is exactly what you would expect. I would have prefered a little tighter fit but it seems to do nicely.
3,Not impressed with Garmin's QC.,"I ordered this power supply twice because the first on did not fit at all. It was packed in a genuine Garmin package and labeled for my GPS but it was not the right size. The second one I ordered was the same in appearance ,(which was different than the original that was what was pictured when I ordered it), but it fit although it was a VERY tight fit. Since it came packed in a Garmin package, I put the blame for this on Garmin, not the supplier. I read that they are trying to produce too many different products at the same time and their quality control is slipping."
1,Not as expected.,"This movie has the same characters as the show, but it just didn't seem the same. It's very long, which usually doesn't agree with the targeted audience's short attention span. I didn't find this nearly as enjoyable as the TV show, and my son didn't watch it much while it was playing."
5,Great as a intro for a new baby,"With the approaching birth of our second son a year ago, we found this movie to be helpful in teaching our delayed son about patience for spring and excitement for his new little brother coming. Couldn't have been played more appropriately if we'd asked for it. The baby is now a year old and our now four-and-a-half year old ""asks"" him to be his squire while they search for spring."
3,Good for laughs,"I purchased these movies and laughed all the way through as there is comedy and horror in each. If you like old time humor and laughable horror, this is for you."
2,Slow down and pace yourself,Portishead with a twist. The twist is that there are pianos and violins in place of the turntables. The singer is a woman and has a beautiful voice that reminds me of Portishead's singer and somewhat Bjork. This is very relaxing music. Is does not go anywhere fast. The musicians know where they are going and are in no hurry to get there. Which is nice because in this day and age everyone is running late and hurrys to the end.
1,"Not a purist, but disappointed all the same...","I am always eager to read completions of Jane Austen's work, unlike those who find it unthinkable that anyone should touch the gems she left behind. I find Ms. Barrett's work disappointing, however, because it appears to me that it lacks the subtlety and charm so characteristic of Jane Austen's: the minimal changes of place and scene, the delicate development of character through conversation and observation, the wry humor she employs and the focus of thought and action through the eyes of her primary characters. This Charlotte is too full of inconsistencies of characterization and plot (Lady Denham throwing lavish entertainments? Lurid tales of piracy and gambling?) for me, and I didn't enjoy reading it. I liked Sanditon by Another Lady much better - I think she did a lovely job of capturing JA's essence and finishing the novel in a manner more consistent with it's original author's style and pattern."
1,very dull and witless,This was a dull read that I had to force myself to finish. The plot wanders aimlessly and is hard to follow. Mnay of the other continuations are better than this so I would recommend saving your money.
2,Good in parts,"I found that the first half of the book enjoyable, but the second half not so. From the moment that she meets with the 'Red Indian' troupe the story descends into the unbelievable."
4,Great bargain!,"The Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable perfectly suits my needs. I wanted a turntable that was easy to use, can be plugged into my Mac, is small enough to tote around, and could be used for listening to records while alone at home or playing some tunes for a small get together. The sound quality is good, and at under $80 USD this little record player is a real deal.Obviously this is not the turntable for an audiophile, but if you need an inexpensive, portable, easy to use turntable that can be connected to a stereo or computer this is your best bet."
1,"Lack of customer support, flimsy stylus","The turntable feels cheap and flimsy, especially the stylus. It would not play large LPs properly because of uneven platter. Tried to have Numark/Ion stand by their warranty, but they would not respond to email in a timely manner or respond by phone. If you google Numark support, it seems many people have this problem. I will not purchase another Numark or Ion product, and I strongly encourage you not to do so either. Try the Vestax Handy Trax portable turntable instead."
4,"Very good for portable use, 78 player (get a 78 stylus)","If you're serious about your record collection, and have a large collection, you already know that you should buy a good quality turntable (Music Hall or NAD) for your stereo system, and forget all the other portable junk (Crosley, etc.) out there. This is great for portable use (vacation home, etc.) I use this for copying 78s on my computer system as well (for now - until I get a dedicated 78 player). If you play 78s, make sure you get a special 78 stylus."
1,Very Disappointed,"Mine came today and I was very excited because I have a fair number of 78s and this is one of the few reasonably priced turntables that will play them (or is so advertised...)Unfortunately, it is junk. The top is coming off just like noted in some of the other reviews, and either the belt is loose or the motor is shot because it not only does not play at a consistent speed, but even if it did it would not be at the right speeds...with the pitch compensation at a full 10% positive, it barely reaches the stated rpms. I tried both 33s and 78s, and the AC adapter.Now I am going to have to go to the hassle of returning it to Amazon and waiting for a (more expensive) replacement. I sure doubt it will be a Numark!"
2,"Nice idea, terribly manufactured","This item is filled with gratuitous functions that should be removed to improve the model overall. For example, battery operation? Is that really necessary? How many people are actually going to take this to the park and play records. To me it was designed only to transfer vinyl to digital format. That's it. With that said it really doesn't need a built-in speaker either. Finally, my biggest complaint is that the unit tends to fluctuate in pitch. This is terrible for djs that want to go digital as it is essential to maintain a constant pitch in order to mix another song. That problem REALLY needs to be addressed by Numark and until they do so I would advise against purchasing this model."
5,Good Service,"The first cable sent was incorrect. I called and received an immediate apology and, once we clarified which cable I needed John sent the correct cable out the next day with a return authorization and return envelope. No hassle; no problems. That's the kind of service other retailers could learn from."
4,"A great, varied album.","Techno, house, ambient, dance, electronica, whatever you want to call it, ""Everything is Wrong"" is just great music by a great artist. It has everything a fan of pop music could want."
2,Not That Good,"I bought this after listening to Moby's more recent offering ""Play."" I must say that Play is the far superior record (see my review there) and that this CD isn't even worth owning. The slow songs sound like piano instrumentals for a movie soundtrack like ""The Exorcist"" and the faster pieces are distorted garbage a.k.a Marylin Manson. Nothing like the brilliant ""Play"" CD which mixes trip hop, funk, gospel, soul and acoustic into 1 totally awesome CD. Don't be fooled by Play's brilliance, save your money and pass on ""Everything Is Wrong."""
5,"Moby Rocks, as always!","As always, Moby takes his music to another level, with creative piano pieces, a variety of techno and various voices. Where was Moby during the days I frequented raves? Luckily, Moby's music is available to those of us who appreciate genuine art."
5,Better than Play!,"Moby, the underground techno icon, put his strongest effort is to everything is Wrong. Hymn starts you with a hint of ambient, almost eclastic beauty. Feeling So Real grabs you after the second or third listen. Moby really streches musically here. Its an odd piece that really grows on you. What Love &First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of. He took chances that no other artist of his time would take. With Everything is Wrong, he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak. We end with Into the Blue- a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves. In 1995, Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it. Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights, which even now distance himself from. If you REALLY want to know Moby, this record is a must! Beautiful spin!"
5,A TRUE MASTERPIECE IN ELECTRONIC MUSIC....,"""HYMN"", AND ""GOD MOVING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS"" ALONE MAKE THIS ALBUM AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ANY ELECTRONIC / AMBIENT MUSIC FAN...BOTH ARE TIMELESS PIECES OF BRILLIANCE, LIFE-AFFIRMING MELANCHOLIC EMOTION THRUST UPON THE LISTENER LEAVING YOU IN A TRANCE OF DEEP THOUGHTS AND CONTEMPLATION... THE UPTEMPO TRACKS ARE DATED BY TODAYS STANDARDS OF SYNTH MANIPULATION AND SOUND COUNSTRUCTION, BUT THEN AGAIN, THE BEAUTY OF ITS AMBIENT AND DOWNTEMPO MOMENTS ARE WHAT YOU ARE REALLY BUYING THIS ALBUM FOR ANYWAY...A MUST-HAVE..."
1,A Profound Disappointment,"This is mindless music for kids on e, dressing like infants and dancing until they drop. Not to say that is necessarily a bad thing, it's just that it doesn't make for good home listening.A party album and not one of the better ones, Moby's Everything is Wrong, shifts between tolerably cheesey and intolerably stupid.Home listeners beware."
3,Some great bits but wildly uneven,"Well, I have to respect Moby for being brave enough to include a vast range of music, from thrash (""What Love"") to ambient (""God Moving Over The Face of The Waters""). However, I still feel he tried so hard to make a diverse album he forgot to make a coherent one. There are some wonderful moments on the disc, namely ""Hymn"", ""Feeling So Real"", and ""Anthem"", which almost are worth the price of admission alone. Then again, there are tracks like ""What Love"" and ""When It's Cold I'd Like To Die"" that would be better left off the album. The biggest flaw, though, is that the album has some incredibly jarring transitions. It reinforces the impression that this is a collection of songs (and an uneven one) rather than an album.Overall, ""Everything Is Wrong"" is not a bad album, but it's certainly not the best piece in Moby's catalog. I would recommend picking up ""Play"" and his 1991 self-titled album first, and then consider this one if you really liked those two."
1,Painful Music! John Payne is the Absolute Worst Singer Ever,What an absolute disgrace! To rerecord Wetton Era songs with the likes of John Payne is like rewritting the Bible with the Spice Girls!!! The production quality is just as bad as the vocals! John Payne is just an aweful singer. His lack of depth and range make this work even more difficultto listen to. Asia died when John Wetton left. Geoff Downes needs to put Asia to sleep for good!
4,A good collection of classics,"Some of the songs were re-made, not as good as the originals, but not bad in their own right. Still though, the overall feel of this album is pleasant. I can't say its the best Asia has ever released, but there is a new song ""A Different World"" which is one the best songs they have written in awhile. It was interesting to hear John Payne sing on some of the originals, not as effective as Wetton, but still entertaining. Nonetheless, this Asia release is relatively comprehensive, highlighten the better songs of the newer Asia and bringing back memories from the former Asia."
2,WARNING: NOT THE WHOLE STORY!!!,"A few years ago, I borrowed this book (the complete version) from the library and it quickly became a favorite of my 2 sons. Being their fav, I memorized the whole rhyme and even told it to one of their preschool classes on Halloween. They both asked for the story all the time so when my daughter was born, I knew that I would soon be telling it to her also. When I found it in a board edition I thought I had struck gold! I received my shipment today and was pleased as punch. The first thing I did was sit down with my daughter to pass down a much loved story, until I got near the end of the book and it ended before the actual story was over!!! I was so disappointed in this version and so were my sons! Good thing I know the complete story by heart. The original, full version would get a 5 star rating from me."
2,God's Outlaw,This Movie is an okay film. i found it a little bit boring but interresting. i never knew that a guy Named William Tyndale sacraficed is life so the bible can be Transfered into english. I think it is a very important history story.
4,works just fine,"this pouch is basic, but fulfills its function just fine, especially on a smaller size wheelchair, with limited space on arms and from arms to wheel. Other styles either did not fit or got snagged in the wheel. The only difficulty is it tends to creep backwards, would benefit from some sort of stop - not sure how to design that. I bought this for my 91 year old mother with alzheimers, and she manages to use it as well as can be expected. The price is great, much better than other, unnecessarily complicated bags."
3,"Small, not sure if my mother will use it","This is a great idea. There are two so pouches can be on either side of the wheelchair. On the positive side they are well made and the velcro does hold them very well. I am sure for many they would work fine. However they are not very big or very deep. My mother is in a nursing home and President of the resident council, so she has things to carry. I don't feel they are going to work out as I had hope. If you only wanted to carry a small book, perhaps a cell phone they would work fine, but she needs to carry a notebook and pen along with notes and they aren't going to work for that."
3,Nifty little knife,"This is what you'd expect from a cheap little knife. It's hard to open at first but after time, it gets looser, much like a woman."
1,Last half of book borders on offensive,"Beware...the author of this book is ""trained in economics"" and is NOT a specialist in the field. The first half of the book is interesting in that tid bits of actual research data is presented, but it takes a wrong turn towards the middle of the book. For example, This is an actual quote from the book "" Some professionals, and especially semi-professionals like social workers and school personnel, have airs of ""experise"" and an arsenol of jargon and dogmas..."" Sounds like the author is describing himself.The author also shys away from early intervention... I am totally clueless. Don't waste your money or time. Buy something written by an MD or SLP.f you actually want to do something to help your child, buy ""The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet"" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl."
5,Great product-great price-great service,"The book had been recommended to me - the grandmother of a ""late talker"". I was happy to find it on Amazon- a great price. The service was good- shipping fast. Just a perfect buy! Thank you Amazon!"
1,I'm Not Even Sure What This Is Supposed to Be,"I would have to echo the other 1 star reviewers who suggest that concerned parents of children with language delays order something more useful in working with their children (such as the Baby Babble DVDs or the Let's Talk Together Book:Home Activities by the same SLPs). This book seems more an homage to the author's late-talking son, who clearly was too busy formulating a solution to the Middle East crisis to speak to his parents. It is merely a collection of anecdotes of bright people who tended to speak later than other children.If you're looking for ""help,"" this isn't it. If you want to stick your head in the sand and do nothing, this is the book for you."
4,Late Talking Children,We have a late talking grandson and this book went a long way in helping us understand his behaviour. Recommended for parents and educators.
1,"Buy the book if you wish, but if you have reason for concern, test your kid","When you have a kid on the autism spectrum that isn't talking/developing appropriately, sometimes things work out OK on their own. That's pretty much a summary of this book's contents.However, all too often, they do not work out on their own, and any parent that buys this book because their child isn't talking/developing appropriately, and decides to do nothing or delay testing and treatment, is making a regrettable mistake.True, some kids talk late and turn out fine. But all too many don't, and even children that are ""on the borderline"" can fall far, far behind unless Parents make an effort to address the situation.Early intervention is key in helping kids on the Autism spectrum. If you're worried about your child, go ahead and purchase this book, but look at OTHER books on the matter, and think carefully about what you need to do to ensure your child's needs are fully met."
2,It's dated indeed...,"First, let's get the negative aspects of this DVD out of the way: yes, it's dated. It's cheesy, corny. The set list does not even contemplate the best songs of Triumph amazing catalogue. The show is from the tour of their final album, when they were clearly writing pop songs and getting mellower and mellower, like a lot of bands of that time did: changing their sound to go with the times.Editing is atrocious, effects utilized also are.The thing that makes this watchable today is, basically, that it serves as a testimonial to Rik Emmett's skill with the six strings. The guy is clearly a natural, both in playing and singing. Also, the remastered / remixed sound was good.This is a guilty pleasure, only that."
4,picture quality is not what i expected but sounds good,"for the price is a good addition to collection. prefer better visual quality, sound was decent. would like to see an hi def release of this."
3,A Staged stage show,As anyone with a brain can see this show is dubbed with a sound track. Gil Moore does'nt even break a sweat with all those hot lights and body heat? Gimmie a break-please.Looks like they made it to throw some extra bucks in the bank before they broke up.The star of the show as usual is Rik Emmit.Without him there would never have been a Triumph.If you REALLY want to see Triumph LIVE buy the US Festival DVD. Dont waste your money on this one.Its all staged for the camera.
3,Somewhat practical.,The book has lots of ideas for those on the hunt for scholarships. The ony problem is that students from small town America may not have those opportunities. Service was great.
5,The only scholarship book you need.,"I'm a college student who doesn't qaulify for a lot of financial aid from my school, so I've basically seen every type of scholarship book out there. I can tell you that ""How to Go to College Almost for Free"" is the ONLY scholarship book you need to get. The book has everything you need, including how to find scholarships, how to fill out winning applications, and how to avoid the common pitfalls. Before I got this book I thought I was going to have to take a term off from school to earn money. But after following its step by step instructions, I won 4 scholarships in a matter of months and not only paid for my tuition but had money left over to cover my books and fees."
2,too much fat,"This book has some good information but you have to wade through the fat to get at it. It may be written mainly for aspiring college students, but I feel it is not complete enough or deep enough for parents. There are many other better books out there on the subject (notably Fiancial Aid for Dummies and Discounts and Deals at the Nations best 360 colleges)."
3,ragged dick,"i think everyone should read at least one horatio alger book, since he so helped shape american morals at the turn of the last century. his very name is a constant catch-all for the american rags-to-riches machine. i inherited my grandfather's set, and, even though one can call these books formulaic, moralistic rot, they capture a spirit and a time in simplistic, bold language that is readable, entertaining, and a fresh peek at cultural history through a primary source. Add to this that i am a teacher who is having my 8th grade boys read it (yes, in part for a laugh), but they are digging it. More than i could have anticipated. Read one paired with Nathaneal West's ""A Cool Million,"" which parodies alger, for a real bully debate about americanism."
3,Didn't work for what I bought it for,I bought some pans from the county fair and the fry pan I use every morning started to build up this black stuff. They told me that if I used dip -it it would take it out. It didn't.
4,Great Start-Weak Finish,"I read everything Parker writes and was delighted with his new protagonist Sunny Randall. Unlike Grafton and Evanovich who have created likable but semi competent characters, Sunny is as tough as Spenser himself. Now the ending is better than some other good books like ""The Firm"", for example, but the Mafia sequence at the end was not convincing and why in the world did Parker want to save a totally miserable charachter like Betty Patton?"
2,Big disappointment for a Parker fan!,"I'm sorry, but this is the worst Robert B. Parker novel I have ever read! I am sorry that I spent the money on the paperback. I loved the Spenser novels, I even loved Night Passage with Jesse Stone, but this book was pedestrian, right from the start. The dialogue was so predictable, I could practically guess what Sunny was going to say. The characters were underdeveloped with no real depth. There was no thrill or excitement at the end of the book, like in the rest of Mr. Parker's novels. All I know is that I will be getting the next book he writes from the library!"
2,Ouch this was bad,"I have read all of Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone novels - I am a big fan. With reluctance I picked up Parker's first Sunny Randel novel. On the plus side I can see Helen Hunt playing Sunny in the movie, on the down side I fear the movie will stink as much as the book.After reading ""Family Honor"" I asked myself is Parker biting off more than he can chew? The book was poorly researched, and appears to be quickly written. The characters were one-dimensional and in many respects unlikeable.Nevertheless, if you are a Parker fan this will probably be a must read, hopefully this will be his last Sunny Randel novel."
2,"Been there, read that.","Let's face it, folks, Sunny Randall is just a female Spenser, and this book is just another Spenser book with the names changed.Same characters, same dialogue, same PLOT, for God's sake! If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was a cynical attempt on Robert B. Parker's part to cash in on the current popularity of female sleuth novels.Hey, and just so you know where I'm coming from, I've read and enjoyed every Spenser novel from The Godwulf Manuscript on. AND I think that Parker has shown that he CAN write something other than Spenser books by creating the Jesse Stone series, which is markedly different, although just as satisfying, as the Spenser series.Just my two cents."
3,Brave try,"A good effort by Parker but not as well executed as his other books featuring non-Spenser characters. Jesse Stone, by comparison, really seems like his own man. Maybe it's the Boston setting (complete with Spenser super pimp Tony Marcus) but I kept thinking I was reading a Spenser novel with occasional mind blows about skirt-wearing and diatribes on how hard it was to carry a gun if you weigh 115 pounds. - rob"
3,No No No !!!,"First, sorry for my so ""inadequate"" english.Buy absolutly the other first : it was the one that i knew, and was so happy finding the 2 record version... but waht a pity... i prefer 1000 times the 1 record 16 tracks version... But not available in France, so i bought the US Version... so much better... no comparaison... the tracks sequency, mixing, etc... my friends have the same oponion... only buy this 2 records version to complete the other, not the contrary. Then it will be fair."
3,Mind numbingly cool,"Hideous, yet mind numbingly cool, Moby finds the common ground between Flipper and George Winston. The thrash and atmospherics sustain repeated listening, without exactly providing pleasure, a state Moby may have anticipated, given his instruction in the linear notes, ""please listen to animal rights in its entirety at least once."""
3,unique but not great,"i got into moby long ago by picking up everthing is wrong. what a horrible album that was. i wanted to give moby a 2nd chance so i bought animal rights. i have to say, moby is unique. he likes punk, techno, rock as well as a host of other styles. this album is a good mix of many styles but the songs themselves just do not grab my attention. there is no stand out song here. nothing to grab my attention. if you ask me, this is good but not great."
4,The years have been kind...,"I bought this album when it first came out and loved it. It real showed a side of Moby that was hinted at in a lot of his techno albums. He really shows his chops by basically giving the middle finger to his critics by letting his talents shine. Even though the tone is different and he sings a lot more , this is still Moby. Beautifully crafted tracks that swell and pulse with the same energy as his electronic tracks. The pacing of the album makes for a wonderful journey. If you like Moby or concept albums this is a gem...."
2,Poor Quality,The seat covers started coming loose at the seams immediately upon putting them on the seats.
5,"Zombies, with a twist","This novel is available to read for free online at the author's website. That being the case will have most of you scrambling to his website to read it. The kicker is that there are three more novels in the story that you must purchase in order to read them. The first one is in my opinion so mezmerizing a story that I could not just read the first one and let that be the end of it. The story begins in a common enough way almost to the point of being cliche. Upon later character development, it becomes apparent that we are not dealing with your average run of the mill type undead. And while the cliche types of violence will kill these zombies, you will have to read on to find out if you would really want to use them or not. This is the first Series of Zombie literature that I have read that actually shows you what it is like being on the undead side looking out in a way that is serious and saddening. BUY THEM....BUY THEM ALL. You won't regret it."
5,foot pads,"This is a fantastic product!! It works - gives immediatecomfort to sore, callused feet * Hightest Rating over anyproduct out there for feet!"
4,"If only the ""bad-guys"" weren't straw-men....","Damn good series. Especially enjoyed the alternate-history angle--what-if? Mr. Turtledove is a master at that.I just wish he'd written some aliens with even a little bit of ability/intelligence/luck/you name it. The series starts out with them on top, and they go downhill from there. I've finished the series, and I don't recall a single time that things went their way. Sure they're the bad guys. Sure we want the humans to win. But, PLEASE, give us a bad guy that's a little tougher. Put me in just a _little_ suspense as to the outcome.That said, I still bought and read the whole series. :-}"
1,Very Close to Pornography..,"I was never more disappointed in any book I read. The story went directly from the eve of invasion by the aliens to ""Oh, my, they're here!"" with no explination no how they got here. The book was also more concerned with the characters sex life. They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'. Even earth people who weren't in captivity seemed to spend most of their time having sex. I will never read any by Mr. Turtledove again."
2,"Over rated, bad history","Though many other reviewers like Mr. Turtledove's work, I have soldiered my way through this entire series and I still don't get it. The historical characters are at best two dimesional. The fictional ones are even worse, more often than not b-movie rejects sent from central casting. Even the scifi, like the aliens, are tired rehashing of older versions of the ancient and slowly evolving civilization over whelmed by human ingenuity.Please, give me a break."
2,Bad OCR,"The book is not bad, but the Kindle version is full of typos, about one per screenful. I'm guessing the book was OCRd badly. The result is hard to read."
4,"interesting, if a little bizarre","Turtledove's usually good for thought-provoking alternate history. In this book, we get to see the human race through the eyes of aliens.While he's no C.J. Cherryh (in my view, the ranking master of alien creation in SF), the author comes up with a pretty interesting race. He gets around the globe a bit, providing us a less Americocentric look at how the various WWII combatants might have dealt with an alien invasion right around the time of Stalingrad. Logistical issues are covered sensibly for both sides. I tend to think he gets too many subplots going, but this isn't as much of a difficulty here as I found it to be in his WWI books. He maintains a good level of suspense and is rarely predictable.Not a must-read, but worth the time and money."
3,Entertaining but cliche,"I enjoyed the book, although a lot of parts were very thinly plotted. The historical background is really lacking in detail. If you are looking for a more in depth WWII alternate history, try Robert Harris ""Fatherland"". The book is written in a Tom Clancy style (10 groups of characters with the action rotating through each group until they start to come togehter) and is entertaining but doesn't cover a lot of new ground."
2,"Intriguing Idea, Tepid Execution","The friend who loaned me this book had this to say:""Harry tries to stuff 55 pounds of (...) in a 5 pound bag.""I'm inclined to agree with him. You'll need a scorecard just to keep track of the plethora of characters (some rather poorly-developed to the point of stereotyping). Quite a few scenes seem contrived (e.g., Mr. & Mrs. Larssen...I won't say more), and it feels like Turtledove has opted for quantity over quality, often filling scenes with comments on liquor quality, etc. Turtledove seems to fall back on constantly reiterating how slow the invaders are, philosophically, to the point where I was ready to say ""enough already...can we please get on with the story?""I stand by my title. This could have been good."
2,Very slow,"Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed."
4,Precise and engrossing...,"I have always liked alternate histories.I have read all the 3 novels in the Balance series and 2 from the colonization series.It shows the maturity of the author that he has so skilfully grown his characters and the plot to increasing maturity.For instance, The Race fears the deutsche because of their skills in Tank warfare.In this book we too come to appreciate the Reich's role in this conflict and tend to support the deutsche even when we know they are nazis.In the Colonization series, the plot matures to show that the nazis haven't really changed much and we support the Race's attack on them.I found myself cheering for the deutsche fighters like Jaeger and Skorzeny in this book.I also cheered The Race when they bombed the nazis to Kingdom Come in Colonization book 2.It clearly shows the maturity and ability of the author."
5,Great Story,This was a very well written book that keeps the reader interested and unable to put it down. The characters were great and the plot was excellent. A MUST READ !!
3,Entertaining fiction.,"Overall I enjoyed this book. Yes, much of the book was unbelievable, and how Jack Halder and Rachel Stern continued to elude capture throughout the book was a bit overdone. I overlooked these factors, however, and just tried to enjoy the storyline and the thrilling conclusion. The characters, both heroes and villians, were very interesting and the setting was exotic. If you are looking for history, forget it. However if you enjoy espionage thrillers, particularly those set in WWII, this may be for you. A bit of advice, don't overanalyze. Just relax, the story will take you along and give you an enjoyable and thrilling ride."
2,unrealistic,"the plot to make did not make any sense.send two people who hate hitler and his cause to kill Roosevel and Churchill.the germans in this book are portrayed as pure evil.like in the starwars series where the sith and darth vader are pure evil.it seems to may as yet another copy of The Day Of The Jackal where one man can change the course of history and bla bla bla.even though The Jackal is by far the best book I ever read.as i already mentioned, the germans are potrayed as pure evil and the allies as pure saints.the plot doesn't make much sense as i don't see the dificulty of assassinting two men.if your german, DON'T READ THE BOOK.if you hate germans, you'll love to see how ""coldblooded"" they are.instead, read The Day Of The Jackal if you like them conspiracies."
2,"Plot Structure, Dialect Were Annoying","I've not read this author's other works, so I can't compare, but two things made the book less enjoyable than it might have been: First, the plot mechanism of Harry Weaver narrating his story to the journalist was patently unbelievable, because (obviously) many things that occurred in the story could not have been known by Col. Weaver. The story would have been good without this convention, and more convincing. Second, it was distracting to have all the characters, whether British, American or German, speaking in British dialect (e.g. beginning sentences with ""Right,..."", ""organising"" a trip, ""in future"", ""in hospital"", etc.). It seemed like the author paid attention to most other details of characterization, but hearing, for example, General Schellenberger talk like a Brit detracted from the effectiveness of the story."
2,too simple,I was looking for something that would be simple to understand but actually teach the basics of gardening the hows and the whys of certain things along with some projects to try. I felt it was all projects without any supporting knowledge that a child could apply to projects they make up on their own. This is good for a younger child but not one that really wants to learn how to be a gardener.
3,Instructions,"It's a good program, however the instructions on how to enter screen names are not easy to find on the disk. They are not on-screen, and must be printed out separately."
2,got the shakes,"My Sony 520's have the shakes too. I've had four of them in my lab and they're terrible. Text and vertical lines appear to squirm, it is extremely unpleasant. I tried everything to cure the problem, I made sure there were no other electronics near the monitors, downloaded the latest drivers, ran on UPS, moved to another building, nothing worked.I managed to return two of them before and Sony is working on a pro-rated buyback for me, so that's good. I don't understand how these monitors can have this problem!!! They're all used on brand new computers with four different video cards (the better the card, the worse the problem!). Including GeForce4Ti4600, GeForce4Ti4200 and Radeon9500pro.I'm going to go to LCD's from now on, or another brand if I want the big screen for much lower price (20"" LCD's are still cost prohibative)."
1,color refills,"I was disappointed again, the quality of the color ink refills just doesn't not come up to pare.............."
4,Reminded Me Of Jane Austen's Works,"A delightful story, done in three parts, of an in-service housemaid. It spans three parts of her life and each one is better than the first. I recommend people who like ""Period Pieces"" to obtain this great piece."
1,dont have it,i ordered it three times and got the wrong one each times so i got tired of writing to them Ron
2,"Less special effects, more plot.","This remake of the original Blob did not do it justice. Maybe it was the actors or the special effects. The original was a superb story in a era of innocence, which made the story believable in its content. The original held your interest, however the remake was over blown with special effects. Too much of anything is not good. Remake should have stuck to a better plot and less of the special effects that we take for granted today. The remake of the Blob seemed to be centered around the psyche of the teens today in terms of getting them to the movies to see this film. Steve Mcqueen possibly would have save this movie as he did in the original if he were around today. None of the actors in the the remake did!"
4,WELL MADE AND FUNNY AND FRIGHTENING REMAKE,"This 1988 remake is far better than 1958's THE BLOB it features rebel Brian and cheerleader Meg fighting the acid like ooze wiping teens mostly into sex and dirty vagrants.this one has nice sense of comedy,outstanding special effects featuring a man getting plunged down a drain,the sewer part and theater.the gore is plentiful and this one features no nudity or drug use.Rated R for violence and gore and profanity."
4,"Very bloody movie, great effects","This was a good flick. Lots of blood, carnage, and violence. The movie had some really gross scenes. A guy gets pulled down a drain, a jock gets dissolved at the hospital{this scene disturbed me the most} and another guy gets pulled through a ladder and is broken in two backwards. OUCH! There was nothing that I really didn't like about the movie. Just that there sometimes was a little too much blood. Certainly not for the weak at heart or stomach."
4,COOL SPECIAL EFFECTS AND LOTS OF BLOOD.,"A good movie but not great as the plot is kind of jacked-up but, the special effects were good and it had lots of neat deaths. Definatly worth watching if you like blood."
5,AR 15 scope mount,"Very nice product, nice price. Installed on my colt AR 15 with a Bushnell 3x9 Trophy xlt. Started sighting in at 40 yards, 2"" off. Not bad!"
2,"Easy as can be, boring as can be.","Henrik Ibsen has made the perfect book for a book review. In play form and right around a hundred pages, AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE is boring and is almost impossible to get into. Unless you need something at the last minute, all you lazy teens, I do not recommend. (JGD)"
3,Lackluster season,"I think this series has ""outrageously"" outraged its own self as a full out no-holds-barred parody. Now Nancy Botwin and family move to a borderland seaside town near San Diego. She seeks out her father-in-law, who is of course a gambling ner-do-well, played sardonically by Albert Brooks. He quickly moves out of the story, Nancy has a hot affair w/ a Mexican dictator/gangster, one son gets an older lover who sells pot in her once unpopular cheese shop that refused to sell hoagies, the other son is the schoolyard stud. And Andy, I guess the writer's gave up on him. Exausted and bored, me too!I really used to like this show. I loved the twisting story lines. I even adored Zooey Decheunel as one of Andy's flames. Get w/ Nip/Tuck and make up for it in season Five!!"
1,Deceitful Seller,"Love Season Four but the purchase was a rip off. Was supposedly ""brand new"" and I was suspicious from the start. Box looked worn when it arrived (the actual Season Four case), not anything close to new. Dics were obviously put through a cd/dvd refinisher or refurbisher. Noticed that immediately upon opening and to my complete lack of surprise the very first disc did not work. Waste of time and money on a great tv show, disappointing. And shady."
5,"Hooked on ""Weeds""","I'd never seen Weeds on Showtime but my daughter has all 4 Seasons...I am SO hooked on the show! Great casting, dialog & storyline. Each episode ends with a cliff-hanger so you want to watch the next one to see what happens.I'M STILL WAITING TO GET SEASON 5 -- PRE ORDERED LAST CHRISTMAS! WHAT'S THE HOLD-UP?"
4,My wife's favorite TV series,"I also enjoyed season four and will be ordering season 5 very soon. Good clean fun with Marajuan as the subject. Well acted and very entertaining. I recomment this for adults, expecially those raised in the 60's."
3,Good DVD Too short,"The DVD is a nice collection of some of the greatest Superbowl games, however it was too short. All in all it was worth the price. I do recommend a buy for any football fan.Mark"
2,Not a keeper,"I was a little dissappointed with this book. After reading the other reviews I was expecting an exceptionally funny and fast paced story. The plot is great, no doubt about that. The execution left a little to be desired. I did like Julia, she is smart and gutsy. Alec, on the other hand, is not really likeable. He doesn't make you swoon or wish to be in Julia's shoes.Sorry, I didn't like this story too much. It is not a ""keeper."""
2,Too Contrived,"I found the situations created in this book were done by having the heroine do stupid things, like getting herself into bad situations with her husband's enemy. The fact that she was presented as intelligent in the beginning of the story made this all the more hard to read. I didn't care for the book."
5,The only screenwriting course you need,"HOW TO WRITE A MOVIE IN 21 DAYS take the complete novice to a level of competency I never thought possible from a single book. It is clear, concise and very readable. It is must reading for anyone who wants to learn how screenplays get done. Master the contents of this book before reading any other book on screenwriting. After reading this book and applying its contents, I did not read the Screenwriting for Dummies book I bought because I already had all the skills and information I needed on the subject."
4,Timeless insights and advice,"Love this when I read it 30+ years ago and still do. Often recommend it to young women now. Favorite quote when she says ""you make me so happy"" and he replies, ""no ,don't make responsible for your happiness"". Profound impact then and now."
4,NOT TOO HAPPY WITH COLOR CHOICES,I looked everywhere on and offline for a dash cover or mat or carpet for my Moms car. Dash mat is a product I have used and purchased in the past. I was happy with the Dash Mat I purchased this time as far as quality of the product . I was disappointed that everywhere I turned I could not get a color picture of the actual color of the Dash Mat I get that maybe there were only a couple of colors and I think a couple might look good either way . None the less because I wasn't shown a full bill of goods so to speak I have to deduct 1 star for not giving all the info. The product Dash Mat is an awesome product otherwise as it cools your dash off and keeps even dust fom being a big problem but the biggie is the lowering of solar radiation through the windshield . As a resident of Arizona I can appreciate even a few degrees lowered temp on a110 degree day.
3,is ok.,"I liked the adjustable heat settings. I thought the temperature controls would include a cooling setting, but it did not. The display readout could be better, but after it got down to 65 degrees, any adjustment downward, resulted in the same 65 degrees. It was kind of frustrating. besides that, the product worked pretty well."
3,Not what I ahd hoped,I had hoped these would help me keep my feet warm...but not so much. Sizing runs large...maybe they are men's socks? (I am not a man)
5,--DAZZLING PIANISM-UNRIVALED PLAYING RAVEL STUPENDOUS,"Being a pianist for over 70 years, I can tell you that Sergio Tiempo is almost in a class by himself---a super-virtuso..Dazzling technique, wonderful insight in the music he plays, and has the best Gaspard de le Nuit of Ravel I personally ever heard...It simple shimmers with shades of gold and one can feel the sea-spray and mystery of the sea... the Russian music of Moussorsky is beyond wonderful...Such musical excitement is hard to image, are rarely encountered in a pianist relatively young...treat yourself to some of the most exciting pianism you will hear...BUY THIS CD AND ENJOY THE WONDERFUL PLAYIN OF THIS YOUNG MAN11"
1,Disavowed by Cartier-Bresson,"Those of you who would buy this book because you are fans of the subject should know that Mr. Cartier-Bresson has done everything he could to prevent this book from being published. It is against his wishes, and Mr. Duncan's decision to go ahead and publish it has effectively ended their (formerly friendly) relationship.It's a silly idea to begin with. Out of an entire roll of film, even of a master like Cartier-Bresson, how many images are publishable and how many are forgettable?This is a sad exercise by Mr. Duncan to cash in on the famed reclusiveness of his subject."
3,[not worth the money...],"First of all, let me say that I like these cats. I have like 'em for a while. They've been undaground droppin' mad cuts. Especially problemz with that eerie old school voice. But for six songs and one that I already have on the ""laid in full"" compilation-MIA-it's not worth the price. I was disappointed with that. This is basically an EP anyway. Don't drop the hard to earn cash for only half an albums worth."
3,Legendary Sherlock Holmes Movies VHS Cassette Review,"Although the casting and acting are right on the money (as you'd expect, and usually get from classic Hollywood films), I'm sorry to say that the quality of the video itself is not up to snuff.The picture is fuzzy, and the soundtrack unclear. This Canadian made video looks as if it was boot-legged in someone's home using amateur equipment.Before I ordered this title, I kinda thought that three movies on one cassette for such a low price was too good to be true - I was right."
3,A master of imagery and the surreal,"To preface, I'm no great fan of poetry. I don't read the stuff often but I was interested in this collection after I read Christopher's novel Veronica. While the poetry is good, its the imagery that makes this collection. Christopher is undoubtedly one of the most creative and imaginative writers working today. I would highly recommend Veronica but this collection will give readers some insight into the mind of a visionary."
2,"Great expectations, almost-as-great disappointment","Scripting is a hot, extremely-important topic, and Barron is to be commended for the very idea of basing a whole book on presenting and surveying it. However, the execution of this good idea turns out to be far too flawed -- this book is NOT to be recommended. There is no coverage of the most important, up-and-coming scripting languages, particularly Python; this is a truly damning defect. The role of scripting in conjunction with XML, EJB/Corba, databases, and other crucial technologies is absent. Nothing about scripting's use for component prototyping, its connection with the Extreme Programming movement, integration of scripting in one's general or special purpose applications; nothing on the vital issue of interaction between scripting and security. A pity: this book could have been far, far more than what it turned out to be. As it is, it provides little or nothing that's not already and better available elsewhere."
4,Try It; You'll Like It!,"Even though this isn't usually my favorite type of movie, I was asked by a friend to watch it with him and was more than pleasantly surprised at how good The Doorway really is. The characters were three-dimensional and did not seem to be put into the action for the sole purpose of being killed. The frightening moments made me jump, but the black humor made the entire movie watching experience an enjoyable one. I just don't plan to go into the basement alone for quite some time! Condsidering the usually restrictrive nature of the genre, Mr. Druxman has created a surprisingly intelligent horror film that expects the audience to have a higher than room-temperature IQ."
5,The audio cd is powerful and the voice will keep you awake,"This man is a great person for making this into audio , my friend gave me this cd and as soon as I started to listen all my goals and thoughts became alive. I found my goals were not big enough and when I did make my goal as big as Mr.Chandler said My goals came into focus . My goal ? 5 Computer certs to make over $75,000 by the age of 27 im 26 and 90 % there with my recent raise.The simple circle planets will have you go why Could I not have started this at age 18"
3,Interesting,"Interesting book, brings lots of motivational issues that can really make you think, and indeed be motivated.I recommend it, easy to read, fast, concise"
3,Use in addition to ice.,This product is great to use with an ice pack. It does not get cold enough by itself. I put it in freezer with inside part facing out if folded. When I use it I place a cold(ice)pack on back of neck and use the wrap to keep in place. The wrap is not as large as ad picture shows.
3,Read it IF you want full coverage of the Palliser Novels,"There is a lot to like about this book. It has the usual host of colorful and varied characters that one finds in Trollope's novels. There are strong and complex women, sturdy and weak-willed men, and some wonderful set-pieces. It's a bit of a let-down after _Phineas Finn_, though, which to my mind is the greatest political novel in the English language. The previous two 'Palliser' novels having been clearly both for and about Liberals, I think that Trollope was struggling in this novel to write in a way that would both reflect and appeal to more Conservative sensibilities. So we get a lot of domestic gossip, a little mild anti-semitism, and endless lectures about the Proper way for a Gentleman to Behave to a Lady. Still, the protagonist, Lizzie Eustace, is a gem."
3,"Not my favorite, but I'm reading the series.","It wasn't hard to finish because it was a difficult read. It's just so damned long. And I'm not certain I can highly recommend it unless, like me, you are determined to read the Palliser novels from end to end. As are all of the Palliser novels I have read so far. The Eustace Diamonds has tantalizing glimpses of Planty Pall and Lady Glencora, and one worries that one won't have the delightful Duke of Omnium with us much longer, but the main characters are people we neither enjoy nor applaud. I think dear little Lucy Morris was given short shrift, and the novel could have used her to much greater advantage."
5,Delightful,"Great book. There's something to be said for Trollope's writing style. The ""Eustace Diamonds"" was written in 1873, and yet it is extremely easy and delightful reading. I was drawn to Trollope's works after watching the BBC mini series of his book ""He Knew He Was Right,"" and decided I had to look into his other works. So far I have NOT been disappointed. I recommend this (and his other works) highly!"
2,I was not pleased,"I was having trouble finding a copy of this classic movie anywhere. I was eccited to see a copy on DVD Unfortunatley the word ""COPY"" is correct. It was a copy. The quality is good and the Menu looks good but the disc was definetly a copy. The case was also a copy. I am glad to have this in my collection nonetheless but was upset it was not original."
4,I couldn't put it down...,"I'll admit it... this may not be the most intellectual book that I have ever had the chance to read, however, recently I had been uable to find a book that I actually enjoyed reading. I found myself up way past my normal bed time with this one! I will admit the plot is predictalbe, but it's the way that the story unfolds that kept me interested. Although you may have known what was around the corner, you never knew exactly how it was going to happen. I loved the book, the message, and the characters in this charming yet tear jerking story. I would reccomend this book highly if you are simply looking for a good read."
4,Greek Energy!,"Despina is a very successful pop diva. Her soft voice dashes through the mellower tunes (I believe it & C'est la vie), while it strikes like a lightning bolt on her dance numbers (Come along now & GIA), not withstanding her powerfull interpretation of traditional greek songs (Ola Odigoun Se Esena, Lathos Anthropos & my favorite, Deste Mou Ta Matia). Although she is no Anna Vissi, this album provides a nice mixture of different styles and it is very pleasant to the ear. It is great for a cocktail party as background music, but it is also very worth while taking the time to listen to it track by track."
2,***,"THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GREEK MUSIC BUT RESPONDED TO ""GIA"" IS AMAZING. THAT SONG CAUGHT ON IN THE CLUBS AND RADIO IN AMERICA LIKE I NEVER EXPECTED. AND AS A GREEK AMERICAN THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD. BECAUSE GOOD MUSIC IS GOOD MUSIC, NO MATTER WHERE IT'S FROM. THAT BEING SAID, I HAVE TO AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER...THIS COLLECTION OF SONGS WAS JUST THROWN TOGETHER FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING A QUICK BUCK. DESPINA VANDI IS ONE MY FAVORITE GREEK SINGERS. IS SHE THE BEST? NO. BUT SHE'S A GOOD ENTERTAINER WITH A HANDFUL OF GREAT SONGS. THE ENGLISH SONGS HERE ARE REHASHED AND RECYCLED. C'MON, HOW MANY TIMES DOES ""OPA OPA"" HAVE TO BE REMADE? NOTHING ON THIS RECORD WILL CAPTURE THE MAGIC THAT ""GIA"" DID, AS FAR AS THE USA MARKET IS CONCERNED. VANDI IS ALWAYS BEING ACCUSED OF RIPPING OFF ANNA VISSI.WELL, THIS IS ONE INSTANCE WHERE SHE SHOULD HAVE. ""CALL ME"" FROM ANNA VISSI IS THE #2 CLUB SONG IN AMERICA THIS WEEK. SORRY VANDI, TOO LITTLE TOO LATE...."
4,"This is the OBSOLETE 1st edition. Buy the 2nd edition ""ANT in Action"" (2007)","This is the OBSOLETE 1st edition. Buy the 2nd edition ""ANT in Action"" (2007).Dear amazon,You need a forward pointer to the current, 2nd edition of this book which was *renamed* to ""ANT in Action"".No one should buy this OBSOLETE 1st edition."
4,Children of Gebelawi,The Children of Gebelawi is a must read for anyone who dares to look at religion beyond traditional interpretations. Maohfauouz takes all of the major world religions and retells the stories of the prophets in a modern day context set in India. The retelling of the prophets allows one to examine the actual stories of the religions in a way that encourages critique and in some cases acceptance. It is a fabulous read - especially for those who enjoy challenging and clarifying their own beliefs.
1,Bad Edition,"I'm giving this product one star, not because it's that bad, but because there's absolutely no reason to buy this version. The X Press edition of Chesnutt's ""Marrow of Tradition"" (curiously shortened to Tradition) is an abridged version with no explanation for the reason for the editing or the choice of passages removed. In fact I had no idea that there were segments (just paragraphs and phrases) edited out until we happened to read a passage in class that just disappeared from my text.The editing doesn't make it unreadable, and the majority of the story is there, but with plenty of other editions in print and available for the same price, there's no reason to buy this one.Does not reflect on the quality of the novel itself; great piece of classic American literature."
3,"Merely a repackaging of ""The Marrow of Tradition""","This edition is nothing more than a repackaging of ""The Marrow of Tradition"" so as to make it appear a contemporary novel. That's not a bad thing necessarily, but it's something one should know before buying it. The novel itself rates much higher on a 1-10 scale. But this edition is not the one version to have; the paper and binding etc. are not the best."
3,Extremely unique..overall not bad.,"American Made's debut album is extremely unique to say the least. A cool blend of Hip-Hop and Punk creates a pretty tight sound. However,American Made's downside is that they went for quantity instead of quality as far as song making. There are some awesome songs on here like ""Against The Flow,"" ""Earth Girls,"" and ""How We Roll....."" but there isn't much on the CD besides that. On the up side however, American Made is definately one of those bands that is going to only get better. I guarantee that their next album will be awesome, and I will be looking for it. In conclusion....since they are on KMG records I think the CD can be had for only $13 anywhere, which I think is still pretty much worth it. Go buy it if you are a fan of fun, and origianal music."
5,Following the Denomination Called Baptist and the People from Whom it Evolved from Christ to 2003,"This book is a must have for all lovers of Baptist history. The author uses a tremendous number of resources to arrive at his conclusions. It is extremely well written, and in a way that can easily be understood by the average reader. It is a very large book with no padding of contents. The reader is made to feel that the author could easily have used twice the amount of proof texts had he felt the necessity. In a very real sense, the author does not trace just a people, but a people who hold to the revelation of Christ contained within scripture itself. To question the conclusions of this work is to refute the whole existing body of Baptist history, much of which he appears to be familiar with.I am extremely impressed with this work and look forward to reading more by this same author."
3,"Not as good as the ""book""",This movie is based very loosely on the the old poem but is still satisfactory.Some parts of the film show depictions of TECHNOLOGY that wasn't supposed to have been invented yet.The cast includes Christopher Lambert as the role of Beowulf but in my opinionnis not the best person for this role. Someday I hope there will be a movie version that follows the lines of the original story more accurately
2,Missed opportunity,"What a pity! For once, a kind of historical theme based in the Middle Ages was picked up by the film industry and what is the result: a mixture of Mad Max, Alien and the 13th Warrior plus Techno-Music and technical equipment that did not quite fit into the time. I wonder how the producers put those things together!Anyhow, if you are looking for action-type movie without hoping to see mythical themes covered then you may enjoy it. But: thank god it only lasts for 89 minutes. Christoph Lambert is not as bad as some reviewers write but lightyears away from his performance in Highlander.In conclusion: a lost opportunity to show something interesting. Never even consider buying this ..."
4,prog?,"This is an excellent album that I stumbled upon. It's very English, very English and sounds like a mixture of Soft Machine, Gong (it's actually closely linked to both units where personnel is conncerned) and a whiff of Syd Barrett.Strange, weird melodies, silly lyrics but sincere performances. Great discovery!"
2,Rather poor,"I am indeed a Saga fan, but this album is very poor. I could only find 2 songs I liked (""That's how we like it"" and ""We'll meet again""). The rest of the songs simply show extremely poor composition and a severe lack of inovation, which is what progressive rock is supposed to be all about.There simply is no substitute for ""Worlds Apart"" and ""Heads or Tails"" as far as Saga goes."
2,Not worth much,"Quotes aren't very inspirational or original and some don't even seem very related to Teddy Bears. Also, most are from people I've never heard of, which takes something away from them. The pictures aren't generally related to the quotes, and the book isn't as nice and ""miniature"" as I was hoping. Overall, not my best purchase... That said, it was cheap."
1,too goofy and cheesy....,"Since the book is one of the more expensive Luna line books, I just wanted to throw my two cents in to hopefully save you some of YOUR hard earned money since I already wasted mine on this book.What started out as quirky and light, quickly turned terribly cheesy, goofy,implausible and over the top cliche' with an almost nonexistent storyline about 80 pages in. It reads like teen fiction-and not in a good way. And yet again in the steadily disappointing Luna line-almost zero romance. Take my advice and skip this sad attempt."
1,Eggs stuck immediately,"I bought this pan because Consumer Reports gave it such high marks. The very first time I used it, my egg whites stuck to it. I used a plastic spatula as recommended as well. I'll be getting my money back as it has a 60 day trial period."
5,Part of a great set.,"I've had Anolon cookware for about 4 years and love it. My small fry pan gets the most use, so I purchased this new one."
4,Good but not the best,"I bought this Analon skillet at the same time as two Circulon skillets. All three are great skillets, but the Circulons have been the clear winners.Both the Analons and the Circulons are heavy and therefore heat up well and hold their heat. But the Circulons have two features that make them stand out. First, you can put them in the oven. I had no idea how great that would be when I purchased them, but now I find myself using it in ways I never expected. I've also noticed how often chefs on cooking shows do that very thing. Less mess, better results.Second, the Circulon pans are dishwasher safe while the Analons are not. Of course I had all those great thoughts like, ""it's no big deal to wash a skillet by hand sometimes"" ... after I bought them reality set in.In summary, this is a good skillet, but I'd suggest the Circulon as a better option."
5,Oh My!,"I love these skillets! How easy can it possibly be? I have my cast iron and would never stop using them. The non stick pans are so nice for the quick items tho'. They heat quickly and completely, no hot spots. They cook quickly too, clean up is rapid. Rinse and dry and put away. You never want to put these in a dishwasher. I did that once years ago and ruined a perfectly good non stick pan. Too easy to clean by hand. Excellent quality and workmanship. Are they cheap, cheap, cheap? No, no, no! Of course not, but, you are getting very good quality and the price is a fair and moderate one in comparison. If you take care of these they will be around for a long time."
5,great,This book kept me on the edge of my seat and i felt like i was in the book. Very sad but interesting.
3,read,thanks for the delivery. needed this item make full rv life more comfortable. what else can a person say. bye!
3,Ok,This book was ok. Had to just get keep reading to get thru it at times. Just not all that I expected it to be.
2,Wasn't my type of book,"I ordered this book hoping I would like it. I enjoy reading about the Amish, but found this book to be confusing to me. The Mennonites ""language and words"" are different. I could not get into reading it."
4,The Human Side Of The Sex Pistols?,"No, ""The Filth And The Fury"" is not a concert movie, unfortunetely. What I wanted to see (and hear) were some of their rare live performances, but what I got was the album versions of their songs slapped on top of live footage--at least the music was remastered (it was done at Johnny Rotten's command). What I wasn't ready for was the honesty. Rotten finally admits that he respects Glen Matlock, and he even cries over the loss of Sid Vicious. The best part is the Sid Vicious interview which sheds much of the bogus rock n' roll myths that surrounds him. It's good to see that he wasn't as stupid as we all think, but rather a human being possibly victimized by the industry. ""The Filth And The Fury,"" is good because you do see the human side of the band rather than the image their manager (and sometimes members of the band) had concocted."
4,Best Doc on the band,"If your a Pistols fan you will like it, if not you'll be annoyed and bored with it. My brother is a huge pistols fan and loved it. I like the Pistols but wasx kind of bored with it. Pretty much watching a movie abotu the trainwreck that was the first tour and Sid Vicious. Makes you wonder if the whole thing was a staged work to get kids into the Pistols. Its amost contrived the manner why which they presented their music. And the music if you listen to it is very sleak and well crafted. The songs, in reality are very pop and the image is not. Makes you wonder."
1,if you like the pistols you won't like this DVD,the director julien temple didn't understand what a great band the sex pistols were. he had all this great film-material of the pistols live-performances. what did he do? he wripped it all apart. every song is permanently interrupted by some footage that is supposed to illustrate some part of the pistols history. you have the pistols playing a song and after the first chorus it cuts to some actors in an old play or a tv-show with comedians. it is really annoying. this film is more about the director trying to be creative and illustrating his associations with absurd metaphors than about the band the sex pistols. it seems one more example of some filmmakers thinking the only thing interesting about a band is a whole lot of unknown music-journalists talking about them. how sad! the footage of the pistols on stage looks like it's great. why didn't they show the footage. why didn't they have them play their songs from the beginning to the end??
3,Reserved disappointment,"Hillerman removed the intensity of his better novels, such as going into the mind of a villian. He focused instead on the inter-relationship dynamics, doing a much better job with the older couple, Joe and Louisa. I felt it was badly proofed and edited poorly. His detective jargon was repetitive and sloppy, making the structure weak. The uplifting spirituality was best during the scenes with Hosteen Nakai, but it felt vaguely empty of feeling. The storytelling with the effervescent Bashe Lady was a great highlight. However, the landscape descriptions needed more intensity, although that remains to be the best part of this mystery. The ending was warm with camaraderie, but the last lines were cliched. I still recommend reading ""Hunting Badger"" for the continuation of a landmark mystery series. It is second draft of a great novel as this is a second draft of a great critique."
2,Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting,"This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results."
3,"My favorite mystery writer, but . . .","Hunting Badger is a pleasant, easy read, but it has to rank fairly low on the list of Hillerman's great Leaphorn-Chee novels. Although his previous effort, The First Eagle, got mixed reviews, I found it superior to this one in most respects. One question: Where did Chee find Eldon Timms's airplane? Mexican Water? Red Mesa? I'm not sure he found it at all, even though he's credited by several characters with having done so. Either Hillerman on his HarperCollins editor seems to have dropped a paragraph or two somewhere."
3,Comfortable (but average) story,"When the Amazon box containing a copy of ""Hunting Badger"" arrived the day after the publisher released it, I knew I was in for a good read. Tony Hillerman didn't disappoint me. But he also didn't thrill me. Having read all his previous mysteries, I'd conclude that ""Hunting Badger"" would place somewhere near the bottom of the pile if I were to rank them according to my enjoyment. This novel felt a bit ""flat"". No real tension, no true mystery, no exploration of the Navajo culture that has become his trademark. No offense, but even Jim Chee's cat didn't stick around for the entire tale."
2,Truth or fiction?,"Mr. Hillerman should at least get the facts straight in his author's note! Officer Dale Claxton was murdered on May 29, 1998 not May 4. Disjointed and poorly proofread, this novel is at least a short one. I find it unfortunate that Mr. Hillerman uses the tragic incident in Cortez as the basis for a diatribe against the FBI."
4,Nu Salt,This is the best salt tasting product that we tried with no sodium and it is priced less tnan other products.
3,It's just a sampler...,"Made in USA in 1999, Serial# DRC-12590, Playing Time 41:04Why only 3 stars? Well, I'm trying to convince you to NOT buy this disc... Is it bad? Not at all, but these types of re-issues drive me crazy.This album is in fact a re-issue of EM's 11th album, 1987's ""Shakin' With The Money Man"", but with 4 tracks REMOVED! The original release had 4 new tracks, plus 10 tracks recorded in concert at the Galaxy Theatre in July 1997. Only 1 of the new studio tracks has survived here, and 1 live track has been omitted (besides the fact that everything's been shuffled around).So unless you're at your nearest gas station and have the sudden impulse to grab this, go for the real thing: ""Shakin' With The Money Man"", a full hour of good music, with 4 new studio tracks. And teach companies like CALAMARI Records (!) a lesson: you want the full release, not some cheap clone that's got FEWER tracks..."
3,"Watchable, but not memorable","Southern California scenery but supposedly set in the Deep South. Story line is not particularly believable, but OK for passing the time."
1,Drums in the Deep South,"This DVD is of a very poor quality, looks like reel to reel copy, similar to a home copy. Guy Madison is listed as apparently the main actor, whereas in reality, he is fourth or fifth down the line. I complained of this to your company at the time of viewing, but heard nothing at all, not even a courtesy reply. Hense, after generally good service, as your company did not fulfil what I think is good business, I have not purchased anything since. Not much to your company, but still fair expenditure in the past from my end. A pity, but unless things chance, that is the situation."
5,"Left me ""Speechless""","This is the best CD I've ever bought. I listen to it every day! Cibo Matto provides a mix of tech. music and alternative with a modern edge. This CD deserves 5 stars because it is packed full of lyrics with meaning. You won't hear them on the radio, but Cibo Matto is far better than the so called music played today."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I GIVE 1 STAR FOR THE DVD NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT PARAMOUNT WILL BE RELEASING A 10TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTOR'S EDITION OF MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. SEE BELOW.We've got a few new DVD announcements to report this morning. First up, Paramount has revealed that they'll debut a Mission: Impossible 10th Anniversary Special Collector's Edition on 4/11. It'll be a single-disc set, but there's no word yet on the extras."
3,GOOD/BAD,"The first movie is good, the second is a wonder for the eye, but a bomb for the brain, with nothing new or intelligent. I'm a great fan of John Woo, but that was not his best work, and Anthony Hopkins was totally wasted appearing only for about 5mins. If you loved the two films, buy this, if not, just by the first one."
5,LG OEM VX4400 Extended Lithium Ion Cellular Phone Battery,I received exactly what I ordered very quickly.
3,Kings and Queens,"A good basic introduction to the first kings and queens of England. Uses too much ""repeat"" footage for my taste, but doesn't do a bad job with basics."
5,Starlight,"LUV IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:DDDDDDDD Its Awsome to me so I don't care about it opinion because I LUV it u haters!!!!May StarClan light your path,Blazeheart, the newest warrior in FireClan"
2,MAJOR GLITCH!! PLEASE READ!,Poor editing... I cant even read this book because it says [.arrowhoriez] after every sentence. i saw a review from 2009 that said the same thing and I see it still hasnt been fixed.. now that's poor costumer service. I called the amazon kindle help number and they said only the publisher cam fix it. The guy said it could take a while to fix it. I am just going to buy the real book. So sad I cant read the book. :'( but the part I read was good though... I got to like chapter 6ish and it's really intense and you gotta read it but if you decideto read it get the real book NOT the kindle version. P.S. the maps on the kindle are impossible to read also..
3,Too many Schaum's in this space,"The book is fine for what it covers, but there are a number of similar books from Schaum's in this space. This makes it difficult to identify that book that covers the material I am most interested in.This book seemed to be the most appropriate for my needs, but the majority of the book was not relevant to me while the book lack coverage of much of what I was hoping to be covered in the book."
2,Sometimes entertaining but spiritually barren,"There is perhaps no bigger waste of time than reading about spirituality from a journalist with little serious interest in his subject. I can't blame the author who admits in the title that he is just a ""tourist"" in the spiritual realm and I am not against some healthy skepticism in approaching this subject, but it seems to do this subject justice you must actually live, not just visit, the spiritual path with some sincerity for some time in order to recommend or criticize. Without a doubt some of the teachers and gurus he visits are easy marks for some cheap shots, but that's what they feel like -- cheap shots done for the sake of entertainment, not insightfulness. The amount of time spent on Theosophy and Mr.Creme is baffling given their relevant lack of importance today."
2,What is a Cluster?,"Oops. Having read through 120+ pages ... Clustering as explained in this book was still a mystery -- making learning MSCS difficult. The Microsoft Cluster Server Administrator's Guide (included on the Enterprise CD) does a much better job through and through. By page 3 in the Administrator's Guide -- you get it. On the bright side, the author does explain how to execute administrative tasks well and there is a section for Clustering SQL and Exchange."
4,An excellent book for knowing all about clusters on NT,"I found this book very good in terms of the topics coverd, in-depth coverage of clusters in general and specific to NT. It has greately enhanced my knowledge about clusters on NT and how to setup a NT based clusterd network. I would recommend this book to anyone who is new and also wants to learn more about clusters."
4,"Very good CD, almost as good as Soundbombing Two!",I've been listening to the CD for 2 days now and I really like most of the songs off of it. Some aren't my style but they're still good. This CD's almost as good as the Soundbombing 2 CD. Definately worth the money.
2,Nope,"I'm looking for purity and/or originallity. Can't find it here. There's too much saccharine and not enough real feeling. I don't buy the melancholy, it doesn't sound authentic. This is one example when the cover is making more than the music. This is out of my collection. Tindersticks and Red House Painters achieve what this album wants: Being real. It's boredom."
5,tru-j is right Fiend and KLC is a deadly combination,"Fiends latest album sounds nothing like his first. He got rid of the usual 20 guest appearances per album and did the almost the whole album by himself. With hits like Talk It How I Bring It, War 4 Reason, Mr. Whomp Whomp, Waiting On God this is easily the most slept on album in 99. Fiend is one of the realest MC's out right now. And I can't for that Tank Dogg's to drop. No Limit 2000"
3,Fiend's great but not this time,Fiend is definitaly a great rapper but this album is ok. I don't think their were a nough other artist's featured on the album. I am white but I am the biggest NO LIMIT fan in the world but they need to go back to thier old ways they were much better
3,The Band of Four Meet,"It reads like a Dungeons and Dragon adventure. This new land Mr. Greenwood created is called Asmarand. And this story takes place in the region of Aglirta where the King has been in a magical sleep for centuries, and Barons fight for power. This is the world our band of heroes is formed in. The band consists of The Four, gruff warrior Hawkril, sly thief Craer, grumpy healer Sarasper and beautiful sorceress Lady Embra Silvertree. They have reckless adventures that seem to never end. And the battles are magical. Worth the read, but not sure I will continue the series unless the book just falls into my hands."
1,Choppy without characterization,"I've read some of Ed Greenwood's other work, with mixed feelings. His Dragonlance book on Huma was pretty good, so I always try him again when I run out of other things to read.Unfortunately, this one has finished me....I'll stay away from Greenwood here on out. This book jumped around so much I couldn't keep things straight. The characters, while they had a chance to help the story, are not developed, and when they are there are inconsistencies. I like the story itself (the only reason I continued reading after 50 pages) but it's not enough for me to recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Five-star movie, one-star ""Special Edition"" DVD","Commercials on DVDs are nothing new. Annoying though they are, you can always skip them with a click of the remote, right? Not anymore. For Babe, a title targeted at kids no less, Universal saw fit to make the commercials non-skippable. They start as soon as you put the disc in, and the ""Forward"" button on your DVD player won't let you bypass them. The ""Menu"" button has no effect either. Even the ""Stop"" button won't work! Once the commercials start -- including one for the dreadful Cat In The Hat that's nails-on-chalkboard offensive -- there's no escape from them! Shame on Universal for ruining the long-awaited widescreen debut of this wonderful film. My solution: I will no longer buy Universal DVDs until they discontinue this practice."
4,A great one for the kids (and adults!),"A great film for children to think about where their food comes from (""Where's the mummy pig going?""? ""What's the man doing with that chicken?"") but it will also encourage an enduring empathy with the animal world. Oh and it's fun!"
3,"Beware, sensitive folks and youngsters","Bambi/Old Yeller/Dumbo tearjerkers repel me. We bought Babe after a decade of avoiding it, but the previews were so cute and there wasn't a hint of darkness, puppies and piggy laughing together! A crowing duck!Babe starts with a scene in which his mother is carted off to the slaughterhouse in a MEAT truck. Sheesh. On the farm we see bloody hatchets and meat hooks, and dogs ravaging and killing an old sheep named Maa that Babe has become attached to, and there is much discussion of animals headed for the dining room table.The second movie Babe, a Pig in the City, centers on a group of dogs and cats abandoned by their owners to starve in the streets, and their subsequent capture and imprisonment at a medical lab run by jack-booted thugs.Ham-fisted? Yes.If you buy this for the kids to watch after Christmas dinner, don't serve duck or ham, please."
4,A cute movie that you and your kids will enjoy! :-),"You have kids.You're kids like to read stories (and watch movies) 1,000 of times over and over and over............If ya gotta watch a story several time, this movie is a sure-winner. There's lots of things in here for both parents and kids.:-)"
2,5-Star Movie with a 2-Star Presentation...,"Here is one of the best movies ever made, but with 1/3 of the image missing. Don't buy this one, folks, wait and buy the wide-screen version."
5,Far better than I expected,"It seems like a silly idea, doesn't it? A pig who can talk. Oh, wait, isn't that sort of like ""Charolette's Web"". Aside from the talking animals this computer and live action film is quite different. I was pleased by the complexities of the characters and surprised at how well the human actors interacted with digitally enhanced animal actors. No really scary moments so little should be able to enjoy this too."
5,Fun story!,"I love this story about a pig who thinks he is a sheep. I love talking animals. But then I grew up on a farm. We enjoyed it even though we really bought it to have for our grandchildren to watch. My four-year-old grandson thought it was scary at first, so I'd recommend it for ages 5 and above."
2,So-So Kid's Fodder....,"I was disappointed with this show, especially the ending. There didn't seem to be a point to the story. Sure, Babe was cute, and it is kind of sweet to see the animals talk, but I don't think this movie would hold much interest to those over 10. If you want a really fantastic pig movie, watch Charlotte's Web."
3,"Pretty lame and pretentious, but still fun","In CDII Mike Dundee is still as likable and fun as in the last one butthis movie gives the term ""slow"" a bad name. Aborigines now how magicalpowers and they seem to have rubbed them off on Crocodile Dundee whonow can communicate with them via the wind with (as well as with theanimals). He even turns out to be a millionaire real state owner !Hispanic and Japanese characters talk in English between themselves.Dundee's girlfriend still can't act. The material isn't fresh anymore.Still, a lot of the jokes are funny (specially when thecharacters get back to Australia) and this movie had enough to make mewant to go see the dreaded CDIII many years later, good enough reasonfor me not being able to forgive it !"
4,Crocodile Dundee II,"A funny nonstop romp of a movie. One of the few sequels that is better than the original. Hogan and Kovoslosky have enormous chemistry and the rest of the case perform credibly. There are a few problems with story that bothered me such as why the aboriginals don't have more force and focus in the story, but it still doesn't take away from the joy in the movie. Worth seeing again and again."
5,Crocodile Dundee II dose it again,In Crocodile Dundee you learn about mick and his ties with the lands of Australa. Yet in Crocodile Dundee II he dose it again with matching wits with drug dealers. A good movie with intertist of doding the right thing in a differnt way.
3,funny & uplifting,Croc dundee 2 a real australian character down to accent and actions. The senery and movie plot was very good. The fisrt croc dundee was very good but this was even better.
5,Exciting and humorous both,"Can't beat the ""Dundee"" movies. This one is especially my favorite. I like how he takes her ""home"" so he can protect her from the drug people. And she fits him to a T."
4,Haunting memories combined with drama and romance,"Irene Stenson's parents died 17 years ago. It was always believed to be a murder-suicide. Irene gets called back to Dunsley by her one-time best friend Pamela Webb. Irene is anxious to hear what Pamela has to say and get out of town. Instead she discovers Pamela's body. Local residents say she had problems but Irene suspects more. Pamela's father Ryland Webb wants to put the tragedy behind him and continue his run for the White House. Irene pursues the case all the way back to her parents' old house, with the help of former marine Luke Danner. Luke and Irene both have their buried troubles however their attraction to one another is great. The dialogue weakens a tiny bit every time his brother says ""Boy, Howdy"" as his constant refrain. However, it is a good mystery with a convincing romance and an intriguing twist in the end."
4,Calcium,this is probably the only product by now foods that I have been happy with.This is a good buy for calcium and has helped me with my calcium deficiency.
3,comentarios del high live de helloween,"me pareció bastante interesante este dvd, sin embargo esperaba que fuera de mejor calidad tanto gráficamente como de audio. la selección de canciones no me parece la mejor y finalmente el corte entre cada canción no gusta. al ser un concierto creo que debería ser seguido."
1,Frequency modulator,"The unit seems built to decent standards, meaning everything is there. Abundantly absent are the connection instructions and nuances of troubleshooting the unit when it doesn't work as one would expect. Of course, absent decent instructions, how would one decifer if it's working as it's supposed to. Typical Chinese instructions."
1,Just not good,"I thought this album was horrible. I am not at all impressed by his wit in songwriting, and the production was extremely underdeveloped. I like a good garage band; don't get me wrong, but each song just has so much more potential. I feel like the real irony of the album is not in the lyrics, but in the album title: The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living didn't seem like it took too much effort.I am scared to buy another album by The Streets, but something tells me that there has to be a better album out there... right?"
3,Not a funny book. The jokes are not really dirty.,"I bought this for an old Russian at the job. He lost his copy YEARS ago. I've heard many of these jokes from his memory and they were VERY funny. I READ them and they stink on ice. Idunno, you figure it out. In any case - I stopped reading and started hoping to hear him tell me more."
1,ridiculous,"Of course there is no reviews. Who is going to buy a $54 album when they don't even give you the samples. Bah, humbug."
3,"if you don't have it, don't waste your time but...","a must for everybody. Three days of peace and music coming to an end and what better way to close than with the legendary Jimi Hendrix? The first performance of the band of gypsies. You will love it from the moment Jimi is presented till the last chord of Hey Joe climaxing with the star spangled banner known to millions as one of the greatest day in the history of pop music. After you've heard it, you might want to see it but what the hell! I found out a few months later that the songs gpsy woman and mastermind performed by larry lee were cut, why? They may be pretty boring songs but they were part of the show, there's still plenty of space availble to put them in, why do you fool people like that?"
4,Excellent practice to supplement my ASL classes,I have taken ASL I through a high school continuing education program. I found the Instant Immersion ASL Deluxe program provided me with the extra practice I needed to receive ASL and reinforce signs that were not initially clear to me in class. The CD provide helpful hints on converting signed English to ASL format. Etiquette and ASL history was also useful. I am glad I made the purchase.
1,not for mac,ok so i ordered this product because im trying to learn sign language and well it messed with my mac and it didn't work. so yeah. if you own a mac don't buy it because if the seal on the package is broken they won't take it back and you're out $30.
2,ASL Delux American Sign Languaged,I was hoping it would of been one CD instead of eight. I was hoping to obtain a CD dealing with whole words as well.
2,Mostly boring,I haven't spent much time with this product. It's very boring. The fingerspelling quiz is EXCELLENT!
4,"Brief, entertaining intro to psychodrama","Highly readable, this little book explains the basic psychodrama concepts in an entertaining way. It's not a textbook for professionals, but provides a good overview of the technique."
2,Almost lost it,"Well charms certainly have changed. No time to reorder something else, I gave this as a give, but it embarrassed me to do so. Sooooooooo tiny it almost went out with the wrapping. No room to engrave even a year on it. Purchased in White Gold the price was not cheap, but I'm sure the gift came across as a gum machine trinket. Too Bad . . ."
3,"Fine, not great","Dugan's book is fine...but just fine. She draws a lot from Cunningham. I bought this book though for help in the basics, the how-tos, which I thought she would cover. She didn't. She uses terms like mulching and deadheading without ever defining them or saying *how* to do them. Instead she spends a lot of time or correspondences and the practical witchery aspects of gardening. She also talks about crafts and craft projects, which was a real plus for me."
4,Clever and imaginative book,"I had to post this review after seeing the latest one from ""The Reader"" in Jersey. I totally disagree with you on this book. It was wonderful! I thought that Garden Witchery had plenty of solid and practical magical gardening information. It is light, funny and I learned quite a bit from this book.As a gardener for more than 20 years, I found the information that was presented to be useful for both ordinary, and magical gardeners. This is a thorough gardening book that even discusses cold hardiness zones, soil and shade requirements. The chapter on the faeries was great and I really enjoyed the tips, tricks and plant recomendations. The gardening journal is a nice bonus.If you are looking for a fun, clever and magical book to read this summer, this would be the one to try."
4,Nice pan.,"I like this for soups and reheating food. It's just the right size pan for smaller size vegetable, or heating water."
3,"Have Matchmakers, Will Marry!","Tibby Mack - sweet Tibby Mack. She's twenty-seven, which makes her the youngest resident of Yaqui Springs, a retirement community near California's Salton Sea. The folks there have become her family, her friends...her matchmakers. But since the youngest man in town is sixty-five, the changes of finding Tibby a husband are slim to non.Then...Cole O'Donnell is ""enticed"" to Yaqui Springs. He meets all the matchmakers qualifications. Age: 30. Looks: good (make that great!) And he's inherited his grandfather's property. He's the answer to their prayers (though not to Tibby's!)What the matchmarkers don't know is that Tibby and Cole have a history. Or that Cole's involved with another woman. Or that Tibby and Cole are at odds over a post office - and a game of gold!What the matchmakers do know is that these two are in love, and that once in a while, love needs a nudge...."
4,Graduate Students Guide,This book is an essential guide for every graduate student. It makes mathematical and technical concepts of management science understandable and useful.
4,What GOLD really is,"Disc one is the entire ""The Sound of The Jam"" compilation. Disc two is ""Extras"" without three titles which would have duplicated in name tracks on disc one but has five tracks added. In effect, two essential albums in one case."
1,Well marketed but lacks substance,This book really lacks the substance needed to pass the Test. Its poorly organized and not recommended. The best way to do well is to go to web-sites and read stuff and buy Sun's publications.
3,Seems to break more hairs than it plucks,"I was excited to get this after reading many positive reviews, and the first time I used it I was impressed by how little discomfort there was (as compared to waxing). However the more i use it the more I think it just breaks the hairs instead of actually plucking them. In the month or so that I have had this thing...I've yet to have perfectly smooth legs. I'm actually really bummed because I hate getting waxed and shaving is too irritating :("
4,its good nd easy,"its my second one of same philips company,nd i found it good,ya u may have problem of ingrowth hair,but its ok,u can handel it,overall this system is good for everytime use,better than vaxing,threading and creaming.............."
4,Hair Removal,"This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. There will be some pain at first when using this product, but its gets easier after the first time. The key to using a epilator is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. If not, you will have some serious ingrown hairs. Don't expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though. The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs."
3,I think it's OK,"The product is not bad and not good.I tried the emjoi before and I prefer the emjoi.Anyway, it depends on the preferrence though, some people might like it.To me, it's like can't take all of my hair."
3,Good Buy,This is a good epilator..I like the shaver head as well as the epilator..tho am not sure if it does such a great job of pulling hair...i see hair growth within 2 weeks...which tells me that it breaks hair when pulling and not really pulls them from their root.
1,Disappointingly dated,"What a disappointingly dated book. i am amazed that amazon is selling this. Had i realized it was this old, I would not have bought it."
3,Interesting.,"When I first read this book about 9 years ago, it was one of the first books I'd read concerning withcraft from a witch's perspective. At the time, I thought it was great. However, over time, I've come to realize that this isn't really the book for those who are searching for information on Wicca as a religion and way of life. Treat this more as an elementary introduction to plain old, every day magick."
5,A thoroughly informative book!,"This book is one of the best books I ever read on the subject of Witchcraft,in the fact that instead of giving the reader spell after spell, it gives the reader the why's and how's of magic. Laurie show the reader what Witches have always known - that the laws of science and the practicing of Witchcraft is one in the same."
5,"""real witches""","This is a great author. Just as you shouldn't fall into the trap of being influenced by people who look like the stereotype, you should also be wary of the mind-set that everyone who does not look plain and un-threatening is fake. Many Female practitioners of magic love exotic eye makeup, black velvet and beautiful jewelry. They are proud of the magical tradition and do not care what others think of their dress style or demeanor. I don't care if people think witches are scary. That's their problem, i'm not trying to win them over. The bright light bambi wiccan movement is saddening."
2,Victory at Sea?,Purchased this video to see WW2 combat aircraft -- the aircraft seen are almost incidental to the video which is mostly about the US Fleets. Bad title for the video!
3,Pretty good movie,This was a pretty good movie. De Niro was very good. Except for the airplane I thought the travel scenes dragged out too long.
3,not as good as expected,I had hoped this might be on a par with Meet the Parents but was disappointed. the story was okay just not executed well.
1,No one is fine!,"It's not fine! It's totally boring. I can't believe I paid full price for this lame film. Robert DeNiro, who would have thoughtNo one is fine! Everyone in this movie will put you to sleep. The story is long, drawn out, and a total bore. With a great cast who would have guessed. To be honest I couldn't tell you what the movie is about. All I can remember is I had to watch it twice because I kept falling asleep. The holidays aren't the same since Deniro's wife passed so he sets out on surprise visits to his children. He seemed to be an unexpected intruder to his own children. The movie could've been better if it were humorus instead of dramatic. This movie was not fine."
3,Basically correct about 1990 decade,"I read this book, translated to the portuguese about six years ago.This book really was about 80% correct about the 1990 decade.There was some failures about the future in 1990 decade?Yes, but they were not big.Congratulations to both authors.The great problem of this book is that we are in 2006,not in 1986.Then, this book is now outdated.About 80% of prophecies in this book became present and then, some of then are now past.If we were living in 1986, I would give 5 stars for this book.Well, we are living in 2006, then I'll give just 3 stars for it."
5,biiiiiiigggg showwww,came in perfect condition no dents or dings love the big show has a good number of matches if you like big show buy it!
2,A guide to one-night stands,"This book is confusing and difficult to follow because the author tries to cover one-night-stands and polygynous dating with the same advice. Basically, you will probably get laid using these tips, but the type of woman you will reel in may not be the type you'd want to see again... ever.For example, what do you think happens when you use money as an incentive to control womens' behavior? She is going to use sex in a similar fashion to control you. Unless she's an idiot. But hey, if you read this book with the goal of getting laid, you're probably into that."
1,This book is also a web site,"Don't waste your money. Although the information is good (great actually), this book is from a web site made up of a collection other people's public writings. If you Google words like ""fast seduction"", you'll find a freely accessible version of the same exact writings, plus more.There are plenty of other good books on this subject you can buy from Amazon, from people who didn't filch their words from others. But if you are interested in this book and what it offers, Google is your friend to find the version without a pricetag. Just Google ""seduction"" or ""player guide"" like another reviewer mentioned."
5,"""The Rules"" for men","I used to think I needed to be rich, famous or incredibly good-looking to be with beautiful women. The website this book is based on showed me that this was just plain wrong. I admit - I'm more or less what you'd call poor, stupid and ugly, but there's one area I'm the envy of ALL my friends - and that's my success with women. And I owe it all to LayGuide, which now, thankfully, is also available on paper, so I can actually give this book to my friends and improve their success as well. The thing I like most about it, is that is does not try to force one ""magic"" system down your throat but presents you with a wide selection of some of the most successful seduction systems currently out there, so just choose the one you feel most natural with and then go with the flow. Highly recommended!"
2,"Better off buying something from Afc Adam, Gambler, or love systems","Book shows some decent advice, but alot of weird stuff that men often SHOULD NOT DO!... many openers of creating small conversations but in the most weirdest circumstances... nothing simple just technical... book has its uses for beginners... my advice buy it read it but RETURN it! your better off with Afc Adams, Gambles, Kezia Nobles books... down to the point and direct!"
4,"""Madame O"" - O Yeah !","'MADAME O' (1967) is a classic and controversial Asian tale of revenge from late 1960s Japan. Raped and left for dead and w/ a wicked strain of syphyllis at the tender age of 16, our forever-scarred heroine goes on to become a Doctor attempting to find a cure by day, and a woman who picks up men to contaminate them w/ her disease by night. Director Seiichi Fukuda uses widescreen cinematography and an unusual mix of both black and white and color imagery to drive home his gore, nudity and shocking violence for the time. It succeeds beautifully all around. The plot gets deeper when the good doctor marries and suspects something fishy in her husband`s past. Say no more. This Asian cult classic is far better than others like 'The Bite-Japanese Slave Girls', or 'Slave Widow', both of which were a waste of time and cash."
2,Motorola battery and battery cover,"I needed a battery and thought I would try the bigger extended battery. A waste of time and money. The battery worked great but the replacement cover and the 2nd replacement cover did not come close to fitting. I like the phone, but ended up replacing it. I gave it 2 stars because the battery itself, seemd to be OK. Other wise I would be looking for a minus."
2,Depressing,"I found this to be one of the most depressing novels I've read in a long time. Not because of Angie's mental illness which was really the only interesting aspect but because of the other characters. Ugh. I could not find one positive thing to react to in either of her parents....both struck me as self-obsessed depressives. Luke and Angie seemed to have some spunk at least but even his girlfriend, Wendy, seemed flat to me. Reading about Jordana and the baby bunny rabbit at the end did me in. Was it supposed to be some clever metaphor for her (failed) relationships? To me the book ended with not much hope or resolve and by the end I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
5,great class conflict treatment,"This was an engaging story on the class conflict, on self hatred, on hating one's parents, on being a teen ager, on blaming one's background versus doing something for oneself, on taking responsibility versus excusing onself...All done with a light touch.I only wish Gervais and Merchant had more than a small role as characters.Gervais and Merchant are not at their acid, stinging best. Rather, their humor is muted."
5,"A small town with a cemetery, a train junction and a big story.",I just stumbled across this movie while on Amazon.Sure glad I found it.The only warning I have is that you must enjoy and understand British comedy and period films.
5,Great introductory resource,"This is a great introductory resource to the nonprofit sector, and specifically, the subsectors within the field. For the reviewer that gave 1 star, due to what he describes as out of date statistics, you probably didn't read the book. That is because most of the statistics are used to show consistent trends in the sectors--it's the type of publication that could probably be updated every 10 years, but the stats are accurate and easy to read and use. I think this text would ring true to nonprofit professionals, and give some insight to folks considering a career in the field. It provides good historical and contemporary info on the fields, it's a straightforward and easy read, and it's a must for professionals in the nonprofit field. I think it would also be helpful to board members--especially new board members."
1,Nonprofit Nation: A New Look at the Third America,"Don't waste your time! If you want to read a boring, poorly researched book of statistics at least four years old, then I suggest you buy it. But the statistics are even out of date. If you have lived on this planet for a few years, you already know about the examples he uses. Pathetic writing. If for some reason the examples are new to you don't trust them. He says Ralph Nader advocated for a safer Chevrolet Corvette. If the author doesn't know it was a Chevrolet Corvair, then he is clueless! Read Greater Good by Claire Gaudiani if you want to learn something."
1,Mach3 or crap3,"Very poor quality, blade feels blunt and scrapes rather than cuts..I used a whole pack of 8 in 1 week, each blade was only good for 1 shave. Dont waste your money"
1,Shady Company,I ordered a pair of shoes from shoe metro. I sent them an email before i ordered the shoes and still have yet to recieve a response. I dont know about anyone else but I do know that customer service is a vital part in operating a successful business. And shoe metro really does not have good customer service skills. This is part 1 of a two part review.
5,Like Walking On A Cloud,"When I purchased these I received them so quickly I could hardly believe it. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I have low back pain , knee and ankle pain. But since I started wearing these I feel so much better. They are great and I would recommend them to anyone."
1,Do Not Buy,"These are terrible! They are uncomfortable and cheap! Suck it up and buy the real thing, you will regret buying these."
5,TWO THUMBS UP,The best adventure read in ages. Don't be put off if you haven't heard the name C.J. Beck before. This one's a keeper.
1,Porn???,"From the cover, I expected a loving approach to better sex for couples but after viewing I felt this dvd was very close to being a straight out porn video with no plot or purpose just sex scenes. Will not purchase any additional series or volumes. This is my only my opinion."
4,A brief look at the peak of the swinging sixties,"This is not for people who try synchronizing ""Dark Side of the Moon"" with ""The Wizard of Oz"". Nor is it for those who think ""Comfortably Numb"" has a ""kick-[bottom] solo."" Nor is it for those expecting live concert footage of Syd Barrett with the band (although there is a little without sound). It's mainly just shots of Floyd in the studio jamming on ""Interstellar Overdrive"". The visuals are terrific. In one scene, it shows us rare footage of a Yoko Ono exhibit in which a model has her clothes cut off by scissors. A very interesting look at a very interesting era. However, at just under a half hour, the film leaves much to the imagination. This might be worth it just for footage of Syd, which is hard to come by."
4,kung fu movie's greatest hit,This movie has just about everything in it. from giant stone gods battling one another to mutant monsters running around. I rate this movie 4 stars for one reason. it has no ending to itand as far as I know there are no other movies that were made. I've looked but have not seen any. I guess this movie is a stand alone movie.
3,Bad Dialog=Funny Movie,If you are easily amused pop this Sci-Fi/Horror movie and let the laughs roll. They must of hired a monkey to write this script...but the end product is bad lines that make you laugh
5,Great book.,"All of the detractors of this book obviously haven't read it...or his website...or his blog. The essence of this book, which is MMT, is considered mainstream economics (post Keynesian as a matter of fact). So for all of you that say ""this is contradicted by the textbooks..."" or ""this isn't mainstream...,"" put a sock in it. This is the exact same stuff that's taught by L. Randall Wray, Bill Mitchell, and James Galbraith (and to some degree, Hyman Minsky), which are all well known, reputable economists. And for all of the ""Zimbabwe"" nonsense, everybody knows that that country and the United States have different economic conditions. You can't compare a corrupt third world country with a low economics education, and completely different economic conditions, to the United States. Pure ridiculousness.This book should be required reading in public schools (and the earlier, the better)."
2,Victim of the Loudness War,"Beware! This ""Original Recording Remastered"" is grossly untrue to the original recordings. I have ""Singles 45's and Under"" on LP and wanted these recordings on CD. Unfortunately, I did not see any warnings in any reviews, from either critics or consumers, advising of the destruction of the dynamic range of these recordings. I'll have to leave this double CD in the car stereo since I can't stand to listen to it on a half-way decent home stereo system. There are so many compilations of Squeeze material available, I will have to look elsewhere for a satisfactorily sounding one which includes post-1983 Squeeze music. I suggest you do the same."
2,"Ok, but not worth the price","Wrapping cloves in Tin Foil with some olive oil works much better, and you don't have to soak the foil first or worry about the temperature cracking the foil if it gets to hot. Makes a nice storage container for garlic though."
1,Not what I was hoping for,"I have been interested in the ethical issues surrounding animals in society for some time, but have only recently taken the step of becoming actively involved in the welfare of animals. I thought this book would provide a comprehensive introduction to activism. I found much of it to be highly abstract to the point of being incomprehensible. The ""ideal"" that seems to be sought is certainly well-detailed, but to me it seemed to be so far away from what is ""practical"" that I finally gave up. I guess I'm more interested in getting my hands dirty and really doing something to lessen the suffering of animals than just thinking about doing so and constructing convoluted philosophies that will never be implemented."
2,Re-hash of VC++ 6 version,"IT appears that the they just updated the prior version of this book, which was not great either. The same useless ""scribble"" program raises it's head again, something that very few of us will ever need to develop for our work. Then you get to the database section and they use ADO. It seems useless to use ADO in the C++ world, clearly if you are using C++ it is assumed you are going for performance and would use OLEDB directly, not adding the extra layer of ADO with all of its variant data types being passed around."
3,Did Shatner Finally go Too Far...?,"Arguably the most laughable - but not necessarily the stupidest TOS episode. Kirk & crew are physically manipulated by telekinetic jerks to perform the most embarrassing acts. Only one act surpasses Spock's depressing ode (singing) ""Bitter Dregs"" - and that is the sight/sounds of Kirk ""winnieing"" and rearing like a horse with a midget on his back. I laughed so hard - I cried. Wink of an eye was marginally good - especially the alien blonde hottie in the skimpy outfit. Aliens move so fast in time, it's like Kirk & crew are standing still. Typical 3rd season mediocrity. But again, a must have for TOS purists!"
4,What the BLEEP?!!!,"My first exposure to Nikki was on the album ""Tom's Diner"" which has variations on the originial, and I was excited to hear the unedited version of Nikki's version. BUTTTTTTTT, some A-hole has decided to ""bless"" this version with edits galore...including an annoying ""BLEEP"" at one point in the song! If you don't want to hear it...don't listen to it, or buy it for your ""lily-white"" children in the first place! Does anyone know if an unedited version exists and, if so, where can I get it? Great song though...I guess that I'll keep searching...maybe on vinyl!"
1,Disappointing,The books contains information on the oils that you can buy in metaphysical shops. I expected it to be a book of recipes to make your own oils. Very disappointing.
1,Does not list oil ingredients,"The book lists 550 oils and what they are for with no index in the back(kind of a big to leave out when you have a list of 550). THE BOOK DOES NOT LIST INGREDIENTS,IT JUST ASSUMES YOUR TOWN HAS A GOOD OCCULT SHOP IN IT THAT WILL HAVE THEM(oh and under the same name). ALSO I COULD NOT FIND ANY DETAILED SPELL OR RITUAL DESCRIPTIONS. As a pagan I found this to be of no use to me and I felt like I was ripped off."
5,Looking for good rock???,"So here I was, wanting to buy a good rock cd. Just looking for anything. Then I got to the letter ""G"", and then I noticed GREAT WHITE. Sure I had some of their stuff and it was pretty good. Never been a big big fan of GW but I respected them as a good straight foward rock n roll band. I picked up a copy of ""Can't get there from here"", just as a shot in the dark. I hit the damn target here. This album has truly opened my eyes. From ""Rollin' Stoned"" to ""Hey Mister"", this album rocks. Highlights, to me, are ""In the Tradition"" (beautiful song) and ""Wooden Jesus"" GREAT WHITE will always hold a spot in my cd player. Keep Rockin'!!!!"
5,Better Sex Video,"I found this video very informative even for a man of my mature years. I cannot say I learnt much, but still found it very informative and not the least obtrusive. The video was easy to view and is a video you would have no fear in showing someone close to you, as it explained the facts of the information it was reviewing. I would have no hesitation in informing others that it is a video well worth obtaining, especially for younger married couples."
3,Voice too small for the role,"This tape prove that Sills needs a microphone to be heard. I agree she has the most fabulous bel canto technique. But to hear her in person. Well, let's just say you can't hear her too well. In this video, they really miked it so everyone is equal. So you can see she can't sing spinto coloratura roles.I recommend that you purchase her Puritani instead. It's on cd, so you can hear her loud and clear. Her singing is awesome, and so is Gedda. They hit some pretty high stuff in that opera. But fair warning...if you don't like Bellini, you'll hate it. However if you really want to hear Puritani sung even better, get the Callas 1953, or the Sutherland 1962, They're the models."
3,a physical approach,"The author presents vision improvement in a way that likens relaxed use of the eyes to other forms of fitness that keep the body, or various aspects of it, working smoothly and efficiently. The material isn't strictly the Bates Method, but it's basically in line with it, with some things added that some Bates teachers may not agree with. The book goes over why glasses are not the solution, then it gets into specific exercises that are to help refractive errors."
5,Great Review Guide,I thought that this book was very helpful for review purposes. It really lets you access your strengths as well as weaknesses. A great help!!!
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this because I heard tea tree oil may be effective at stopping dandruff and scalp itch. It did not work for me. It actually made my itching worse and my scalp flake more. Perhaps it was the carrier oil in this solution or that there was not a high enough concentration of tea tree oil.I have found that Kera Care scalp conditioner with salicylic acid is working better for me to control flakes although unfortunately the itchiness is about the same.
2,Poor,Love MMA is the only reason I didn't give it one star. Poor acting. In the the top 5 of the worst movies I have had the misery of watching.
3,"Duke Nukem is fun, a good buy and bargin","Duke Nukem 64 hails from the PC hit DN 3D. Same levels same storyline,except, more levels, and new weapons. Cool huh? It's not done yet, there's even a co-op mode and vicious deathmatches. I own it, and it kicks major butt! A good buy and bargin."
3,PC version is better,They took out too many of the cool and funny details when they converted this PC game to N64. The multiplayer is ok and if you have the cheat codes since there are a billion extra levels to play (though i don't recommend the pitch dark castle)
4,Fantastic pans,"After quite some research and deliberation I decided upon these pans, mainly because hard anodised is the bext type of non-stick coating at the moment, and also because of the Anolon name. The pans are great. Good, solid construction, and heavy bases. They cook well.One thing to note is that as with all non-stick you must use plastic or wooden utensils in here.The one negative is that the pictures on the Amazon website shows the saute pan with this set. However, when I received it I noticed that it came with two frying pans. Looking back at the item description it does indeed say it comes with 8 inch and 10 inch french skillets (frying pans). So, the text (and contents) and photos do not match. Amazon should rectify this!"
4,999 Concrete excellent cd!,"999 Concrete cd a excellent cd,with bonus tracks.A favorite of mine from a great band. I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock n'roll. I did not know before I ordered this album it had so many bonus tracks,if I had,I would have got it sooner!Old school Paul"
5,Great!,These are my favorite style. It is so fun to explain this game to people. The cards suck them in. The game keeps them!
1,What a shame....,this would have been a really good movie if they hadn't hacked out half of it. I've only seen the real one once and it was great. in this they hacked out Toshiro Mifune and a bunch of other characters. The cutting is worse than when they [messed] with the battle of the bulge or when they lopped out the corral sea battle in midway. if they left in this footage it would make much more sense. I bet Ted Turner's crew was reponsible for these cuts.
4,"Good, but not Baby Einstein","Don't get me wrong; this video is good! The music is great, the artwork is lovely, and parents can enjoy it even though it's been played 100 times. However, the artwork/music presentation is like a piece of choreography that was overworked to hit everything in the music and ended up being less-than-pleasing. And then the makers slacked on editing the scenes/sounds of children talking and doing art. Also, each peice of artwork shown includes print of the title and artist on the lower corner ON the artwork (not off to the side), interrupting the enjoyment of the art. The print is very small and hard to read -- really distracting. Since the artists and titles should be shown somewhere, why not put that information at the end? This video tries but isn't quite the standard of Baby VanGogh."
4,It is just great!!,"I am a nanny and the youngest child is just two. The family has several Baby Einstein videos and we enjoy at least one of them every day but when I saw the Baby Laureate's for sale, I thought it would be fun to try something different. The two year old loves it and today when she and I were watching it, the 9 and 10 year olds came in and watched with us. We all got something different and wonderful out of it!"
1,Garmin 12 Volt Adapter,I thought it was for the Garmin 296. Probably my mistake. Will trade it off for a Garmin 296 cable.
5,Garmin 276C 12 volt adapter,"This adapter works as it should with the Garmin 276C GPS. Some reviews made me wonder if I should order this part directly from Garmin instead of from Amazon but I was pleased with the results. Although the item I received did not have the 90 degree bend in the end that attaches to the GPS unit as shown in the picture and like my original part, it works just as well. I use this GPS for 4 wheeling off road and was delighted to find this replacement part at a reasonable price. Thanks Amazon."
2,Some recipes are problematic,"I'm not sure if these recipes were actually made by the author. Some don't fit into the jar, and some don't make sense. The magic bars recipe tells you to put all the dry ingredients into the jar. . . o.k., the graham cracker crumbs go in first (on the bottom). The cooking directions tell you to mix the graham cracker crumbs with butter and make a crust on the bottom of the pan, then pour the rest of the jarred ingredients over it. . . how exactly do you do that.My daughter is making lots of jars from this book - but we have yet to cook one - I'm a little afraid of what's going to happen.Also, some of the recipes are just the same recipe with a different name and the ingredients in a different order. . ."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Merlin is trapped in a crazy version of Wonderland, which is actually, of course, just a Shadow. Some complex sorcerous shenanigans by various members of his family, ensue, as well as contact with Fiona, and stunts similar to Brand's, in the first series."
4,Clerks meets Pulp Fiction,"I am a big Pulp Fiction fan. A friend saw this movie at an Film Festival and said I would really like it. Its really good. Its like the characters from Clerks were thrown into Pulp Fiction. The acting is good the editing is great, good music and great dialogue."
4,Very thorough and informative,"Finally! A long-awaited book on this little known but fantastic breed of dog. This is very well done and the history section is wonderful. My only complaint is I would have liked to see more varied photos of the breed, since there are several different types and colors. The author is obviously very focused on her own dogs and features them prominently, but it would have been nice to see a greater representation of the breed. Neverthless, overall this is very well-written, and the author includes a lot of pertinent information, including a well-defined standard. Definitely worth getting if you love this breed as I do!"
3,Super Reader,"This line about sums this book up :He looked grateful at the fantastic four, Slayer, Slayer, vampire, vampire. ""Now you see why I'm glad you folks showed up.""Spike helps himself to a leap through the door, and when none of them come back, and no children are returned, Riley and Gunn go to break Faith out of jail to help, being all out of superpowers at their end.So, the gang is most definitely all here in this book."
1,Concerned about teflon,"They work well enough, but I realized some months after purchasing them that teflon (the nonstick coating) is a likely carcinogen, especially at high temps, which is exactly how you'd be using it. Since this is still not 100% proven (or that the truth is squelched), it's your judgement call about whether it is wise to use products with teflon."
5,Great bargain,"10 of the most used items in basic household cooking. THis is the ultimate starter set. I'm a bachelor, and with this set, I can do anything from 4 pancakes at a time in the 12"" saute (I'll probably get the cdouble burner griddle eventually), to a single omelette in the the 8"" skillet. The 2 and 3 qt sauciers are exactly what I need for pasta, potatoes, veggies. They have a nice heft to them, and the non-stick coating has worked flawlssly. Keep in mind, eggs always seem to stick, even on the best non-stick, so use a little oil or butter with them. Highly recommended. Get a steamer insert, and the 6 qt piece is perfect."
4,quite happy,"everything was exactly as I hoped it would be. Dvd's arrived in a timely fashion, good shape and I would use this experience to order from here again."
2,Discs damaged,"NCIS is a great show, but this is the second time discs have been damaged. I purchased them new. Not too happy about that."
4,happy,dvd's work. package is decent. it is what it claimed to be. I have no complaints about the product. :)
1,Missing disc 6,This season was missing disc 6 which included the season finale. Everything else worked okay except I did not get to see the last 3 episodes of season three.
1,Very disappointed,The NCIS movie i ordered came in in a timely manner. It was in the condition stated at the time of purchase. These are the things i am very pleased with. Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice. The moral deploriaty is why we do not have cable or an atenna in our house. These have gone to the trash as is fitting for such lack of marality.
2,Again... Why is not in Spanish? Al menos pongan subtitulos,"Creo que por lo menos deben colocar subtitulos. Always is tha same thing we, the spanish speakers, get to wait for spanish version. Esto está mal, anoche pre ordene la serie, pero hoy la voy a cancelar por que me di cuenta que no esta en español."
5,Great DVD's,I especially like the feature where you can choose to play all the episodes and play straight through the DVD. The previous seasons didn't have this option.
4,surprisingly useful,"This is a surprisingly useful little book that fills in some major gaps in the HP documentation. Its principle utility is that the author takes the time to, in general, explain the underlying *logic* of the various components of th HP 49/50g's architecture, something that the HP documentation largely omits. The HP documentation tends to focus on key-by-key instructions; this treatment glosses over that to focus on the underlying concepts.It is not, however, a replacement for those documents. Many features, particularly in the libraries, are skipped or treated superficially. There is also a presumption that the reader is somewhat computer/software savvy. He spends considerable space on details and idiosyncracies that, while important if you run into them, may charitably be considered obscure for must of us.-- gary"
4,Midway with Battle of Coral Sea omitted,"This production is very good. However, I have one big complaint: The Battle of the Coral Sea was omitted AGAIN.I'm still waiting for a production that contains the full story. I would not have bought this edition if I had known that the Battle of the Coral Sea was omitted."
4,A serious film about this pivotal WWII naval battle.,"The film takes advantage of actual WWII combat film footage as it presents the battle from both the perspective of the United States and Japan. Many international stars perform as the key figures in the respective naval forces. We see the battle emerge as estranged United States naval officers (father and son) portrayed by Charlton Heston and Edward Albert, meet in Hawaii and move to their respective duty assignments. The film makes a thoughtful attempt to give an historically accurate presentation of events. It is entertaining and shot with clear visual effects when not using actual combat film footage. Weaknesses in the DVD presentation are; a sound track with light background static; and during the Japanese attack on Wake Island, a few scenes appear to be lifted frame-for-frame from the 1970 film 'Tora! Tora! Tora!', and for people familiar with the earlier film, this is distracting."
3,A concise and detailed report of this decisive WWII battle,"The significance of this Battle of Midway as a turning point in the Pacific war is brought home to the viewer. The acting os good (for the era) and the integrated battle film clips are well presented. I give is just a 3-star rating simply in comparision to more modern film production and acting techniques. For a WWII history buff, though, it is an important film to watch."
5,It's a very good war movie.,One of the best war movies ever made of WWII. A good line up of stars and good story line.
5,WWII Movie,"Movie arrived promptly and in excellent shape. All time great movie.classic movie, world war ii"
1,Why?,"I expect a good buy but when it still isn't Blu Ray, they have cut much of the original out, I'll wait. Either do it right or don't do it at all. Not interested in being taken anymore by corporate America. And Blu Ray shouldn't cost any more than a regular."
4,A brilliant war time classic!,"There are very few movies which will have you supporting either side of the nations involved (it's only a film afterall) but Midway will have you in Matt Gogh's cockpit dropping those final torpedos on the Japanese carrier. Although the movie is a little long winded during the opening scenes, the majority is well worth waiting for. I would agree that not all details of the battle were accurate but what war movie boasts a perfect score in that category? none. If you like Naval and or Airforce war films then youll love 'Midway'"
3,"The ""Coral Sea"" Version was indeed better",I saw the version which included the Coral Sea campaign. Hollywood loves to short change us.
2,Midway shortened...why?,Agree with the previous reviews in that if this is collector's edition why would we be missing any scenes from the original in theater movie released in 1976? The missing scenes bring more background to the event and Captain Matt Garth's character. Until these are restored this cannot be considered a collector's edition. When they add them then I will purchase it.
2,LESS THAN MEDIOCRE,"I was in the US Navy, and I found this movie absurdly unrealistic. First of all, no one as old as Charlton Heston was ever involved in actual battles in WW2. His acting, as usual, was lousy, his age betrayed the film. I find elder actors degrading the heroes of WW2 repugnant. I gave this video away to the local Goodwill store."
1,Midway,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband (retired Marine). Although I have seen the movie several times, I did not watch this particular copy. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it!"
4,Another WW II gem,Six months after the attack at Pearl Harbor came the battle at Midway Island and was the turning point of the Pacific conflict in WW II. To Japan we looked defeated but the resolve of America beat the odds and turned the tide. Sound quality is poor plus they cut over 35 minutes from the original theatrical version for unknown reasons. Otherwise it would be 5 stars.
2,Avoid this by all means,"Two CDS- well, if you expected two hours of music, forget it- both clock in at 32 minutes. That may seem unfair, but given how lousy the music is, it is an ironic blessing. Noise, shredding, loud guitar work, thuimping drums and rageful vocals- nothing too original here, Ms. Lady from Rochester- your rave review is hard to justify."
5,compelling and beautifully crafted,"This is a story of two young black southern women determined to leave the south and make life work for them. It is written in a fresh, intelligent, witty and honest voice, compelling and beautifully crafted. The characters are colorful, adventuresome, strong-willed, bright and intriguing. Singleton is a wonderful storyteller. I'm waiting for more."
2,Too basic information contained,I'm dissapointed with the book as it does not give us enough information on holistic aspects of Tube Amp building as it contain too much of unnecessary basic information and pictures. I think it's good for an overview for valve amp building theory but not practical.
3,:),"Interesting story, so far. I have not yet finished reading this book, but I do look forward to doing so."
4,Good for the price,"These are great practice swords for single-person techniques or stage combat, but don't expect to duel with these things. They are relatively fragile (we shattered, yes shattered, one of these with two 5th graders in a drama class) The wraps can also loosen or fall off if they are picked at (another problem with youth using them) The look is great, the handling is great, but they are not childproof!"
1,WTF,"I am the purported author of this book to be, yet I have never heard of it. Is Wiley planning something here? Huh?"
3,"Not the greatest, but worth watching...","I saw this movie on video back in the 80s when I was about 8 years old (see...not all kids who watch r rated movies turn out to be criminals or have psychological issues), so thats why I only gave it 3 stars. I just can't remember the dialogue and overall production of the film. I do remember the plot though and its about a group of men who rape and torture this woman out in the woods and instead of crawling into a hole of depression and despair, the woman decides to strike back and get her revenge against these men. One by one she lures them into her trap by romancing them, torturing them and KILLS them! I remember being creeped out by the movie and since it made it to DVD, then obviously I must not be the only out there that thinks this B movie is a classic. Check it out..."
3,Sadistic Attack = Sadistic Revenge,"Controversial and hated by critics and feminists, it's easy to see what people found offensive here. A very prolonged and cruel rape scene that is hardly a pleasure to watch. A series of acts of revenge that are justified but methodical and lacking in emotion.ISOYG is not a badly made film- the problem is the realism of the sexual assault that provokes the less than realistic acts of revenge by Camille Keaton on her antagonists. Watching a 20+ minute scene of a pretty young woman being brutalized and tormented by four rural thugs is no picnic, and maybe credit should be given for portraying such a horrible act in a way that is unglamorous and very unsettling as it should be.After suffering with our victim, it's not hard to lust as she does for the blood of her attackers. You may find the revenge less than satisfying and cliched and you may find ISOYG a little overhyped and overlong.."
4,"Ok movie, good commentary","This was an Ok movie. It is not for everyone and not the type of movie you just watch because your bored. Its a violent, mean film. But vengeance is the name of the game, from a female viewpoint. Revenge flicks will always be made, in theaters now we have Death Sentence and The Brave One. So, if you like revenge films, check it out but please, do not have any children present."
2,It's seems unfair... but those are the Breaks.,"Well... where do I begin....I think it's a little well played, a lotta gore,.do you wanna know why I give this Movie a 2 out of 5 rating?Because of the blood scenes!!!!That is all!!"
3,I Know What I Am Talking About!,"Definatley not a movie for the kids. This movie yields a tale of a young writer on a holiday in search of her best novel yet, but the site she chooses for her little getaway turns into a nighmare you can't imagine!"
1,Mindless exploitation,"The people who made and starred in this film must have been slumming for a paycheck. How original- a nieve city girl decides to get away for a while in what looks like the inbred capital of the world, and is followed and eventually attacked by some real ugly rednecks. Don't be fooled into thinking this is something shocking or controversial like the cover would have you beleieve (banned everywhere, blah blah)it is just plain crap. If you want GOOD low-budget horror, go get Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dead Alive, etc. This is for people with no lives to fulfill their rape fantasies."
1,Femenist statment or dude where my fast forward button,"Under the title Day of the woman this was movie is said to be a femenists statment, Please calling this movie a femenist statment is an insult to women everwhere .I mean someone get me gloria alred on the phone I think this could be grounds for a class action lawsuite here. but I digress this late 70's piece of explotion left me feeling in need of a shower."
3,Hard one to watch,"I'll keep it simple. This is a hard movie to watch; however, it was a really well made movie. The rape scenes are so realistic, that at times I felt like I was going to be sick. Despite that, the film really draws you in and by the time the woman takes her revenge, your right there with her cheering her on. I only wish her revenge could have been more brutal. Yeah sure, in one scene she removes a guys you no what, however after those rape scenes I think more torture is deserved. WARNING, this movie is not for everyone."
5,Great!,"The package got here very fast - the kernels look great - now I have plenty to sprout! OK, gotta write more words - I really just wanted to give a rating..."
1,Moldy grass,"So, when I got this the bag had exploded all over the box and there was seed everywhere...for weeks. So, I tried to grow some of it anyways...MOLD lots and lots of mold... Ew. But I did get a refund... had to return the remainder, but that wasn't much with the amount that spilled everywhere. I also sent a picture of the mess it made... Won't buy this again."
3,Seeds are good - packaging was bad,I ordered these seeds to grow for my animals. The packaged arrived in terrible shape with seeds spilling out everywhere. I am not sure how much volume was lost on the trip (I did not weigh it).I did germinate the seeds as directed - which was very easy. The germination rate was good and the grass was very nice.My cats (and my dog) love it and I also gave some to the neighbor who also loved it.The product itself is good - they just need to have better packaging. A thin plastic bag in a mail envelope is not the way to go.
1,Buy through Amazon - there web site. Seeds not so good,"I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase.Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic, and the seeds don't so so well. They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender.I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good."
4,"Different, but Enjoyable","I chose this book after reading the Michelli Family series. I must say that this book is different than any other Christian mystery/suspense I have ever read (and I have read MANY). It wasn't one of those ""can't put it down"" type of books, but it did have an element of surprise which I found refreshing. The characters were complex which made the book more intense. I have found a new favorite author."
5,Feel good,"Started yesterday, finished today. Loved it! Couldn't put it down! I love Kristen`s writing. The first book I ended up reading by accident, now I almost read all of them."
2,Like a Cheesy Info-mercial...,"Eve Plumb seems to be the only former Brady that's made anything of herself that isn't totally focused on the Brady-glory-days. She's an established artist! The 2 stars are for her alone. Seeing her with her art work was worth watching the disk...but not worth owning it.Oh, Ann B. Davis is really cool too! She's a stage performer now.If you're a Die-Hard Brady Fan and can't get enough of 'em then this disk is for you. Sure, you'll see some of their home movies...they say ""Never before seen footage..."" But, none of it was a real big suprise to me. I've seen their home movie footage on several TV Tabloids, encluding E True Hollywood. Their playful banter with each other seems VERY scripted and phoney.Personally, I'd like my Brady Memories to remain with the show that made them all famous to begin with.Bring their Series episodes to DVD Format. I'd line up to buy those! I'm not kidding!!!!This was too cheesy."
5,Vaudeville - Brought Back to Life,"This massive two volume work is without a doubt the greatest tribute to vaudeville and its performers ever written. It brings back to life an important aspect of show business that has almost been forgotten.In this book you relive the lives and stories of a group of hard working entertainers, many of whom went on to give birth to the motion pictures, radio, and television industries. Most of the stars of the years between 1925 and 1960 got their start in vaudeville.You won't read this book in one night, but it could provide a thousand nights of some of the greatest entertainment you've ever experienced.If you love show business and all of it's aspects, then you will absolutely love this masterful work. It may just be what is needed to help resurrect the spirit of a long deceased tradition."
4,Needing a lift?,"This fits well inside of the shoe and doesn't move around. It has different heights for different needs. Unfortunately, I have to have a build up and the outside of my shoe and can't use those anymore. Also, I got a better price here than at the Drs. office."
3,"8"" in ceiling","Its sounds slightly above average, but u need an inclosure or box behind it because it really cant do that good in open air, it will start popping when bass hits. If speaker enclosed i think can perform well considering it sounds decent without an enclosure"
4,Not the only book you'll ever need,"This is quite a handy book, there were a lot of interesting practical things that I didn't know or wish I knew or been wanting to know. Many of which includes:* Useful Air Travel Tips* How to find water in the desert* How to treat a venomous Snake Bite* How to perform the Heimlich Maneuver* How to perform CPR* Basic First Aid (to treat basic ailments)* Poisonous Plant Guide (what/which part of plant is poisonous & poison symptoms)* Common Ailments and their Remedies* Foot and Hand Reflexology* Acupressure Chart* Yoga Positions* Serving Size Chart* Chicken Soup Recipe* Table Setting* Dance Steps (for Waltz, Tango, Rumba, Foxtrot)* Palmistry Chart* Sun Dial* Wonders of the World Checklist* Learn to Drive a Stick Shift* How to Change a TireAll in all, it's a real nice practical book, but not the only book I'll ever need. It's one of those books that you read once, look over it once more later on, then forget about it."
5,Great Christmas Gift ?,"Bought this book as a Christmas present for my nephews going off to College. They put them aside and gave polite thank-yous, but the books didn't quite compare to the X Boxes and such. Months and months later I recieved an Email from one of them thanking me again for the book, saying it came in handy a lot, and even some of his buds were using it. So,..I've got more nieces and nephews leaving for college in a couple years, and I fully intend to give more of these books to them, but maybe not for Christmas!!"
5,"Men of the West: Harden, Evan, Donavan","This is a reissue anthology of three classic Diana Palmer Long Tall Texans stories. Those who were there will welcome Harden, Evan, and Donavan back. For new readers, it's a treat waiting to be discovered."
2,disappointed,"i loved the original poster i lost due to a move, i decieded to replace it and ordered this poster but when i recieved it it was NOT black and white but black and blue."
5,Instant Classic,I love how these books are so entertaining and colorful! I bought one for grandma and grandpa from my son for christams!
2,Not a Great Book,I was a little surprised by the content of this book. It is really not a book I would recommend. It is about a Grandma who takes her grandkid to the beach and nothing goes right. Then it ends. I thought it could have been more meaningful.
1,Paradise?,"A young woman is out shopping when she's kidnapped, drugged, molested, and raped. Then she's eventually apparently SOLD to a guy who takes her shopping. When she discovers him with another woman, she is at first offended, but remembers the shopping so fondly that she returns. It all makes for a pretty dismal ""paradise."" The jerky camera effects get old pretty quick too."
3,Fast Read............,Details details.. I wish this book had more of them. I was a bit disappointed in getting this hardcover to see that I could read it in a couple of days. The pages go by fast as they cover Morgan's daring raids throughout Kentucky and the north. I was hoping to get more information than the quick coverage of the events that Morgan and his raiders went through. I would have liked to get some insight from his companions in the field and also from his enemy. This book seems to summarize Morgan and probably isn't the best when it comes to dates and details. It is important to suggest this book for anyone looking to read about a different Confederate cavalry commander instead of Mosby or Stuart that doesn't want to get into serious details. Perhaps this book exemplifies Morgan himself. It was short and fast. Morgan started his command quickly and finished quickly.
4,Natasha,"The product is okay for the price. However, having used used both Infinity and Instyler I must say I prefer the Instyler. I would pay the higher price.The Instyler holds more hair and as a "" Do-it-yourself"" product it is better, as I don't have to hold my hands up as long a time as with the Infinity. I think it would be better for short and less thick hair."
1,not worth it,"Very dissapointing! It did dry(while it was working) my very curly,frizzy hair, but left it just as frizzy and curly. I still needed to use a flat iron after it. But then it just stopped working. I plugged it in, turned it on and it made a strange humming sound, and that was it. It was functional for 6 months. I can't say that it worked for 6 months though because even though the unit did turn on and dry my hair, it did nothing in the way of straightening my hair. Don't waste your money on it."
1,Not even worth considering it as an opition,"I have already returned mine that I bought from here. Trust me, it's not worth the $50. It made my hair really frizzy and is more of blow dryer than a straightener. When I usually straightener I like to listen to music or watch TV, but with this I can't do either because it makes that noise that blow dryers make. It just really doesn't straighten hair that well either. Save yourself a lot of regret and don't buy it."
1,Wow...this does nothing,"I bought this hoping that I could get rid of my flat iron, but this is nothing more than a hair dryer with a comb attachment turned sideways. The tension settings either pulled my hair too much or didn't put it at all. My hair looked just the same as it would have if I had used my hair dryer and a comb attachment. Save yourself some money and buy a $5 comb attachment to put on your hair dryer. I have AA relaxed hair."
1,burned after just one use,"I got this stuff as a gift in europe but because of the voltage i gave it back and bought it here in USA. The USA version looks pretty much cheaper and poor made than the (same brand-model-etc.) european version. I used it once with hardly satisfactory results, the second time something burned inside and start smoking. I wouldnt recomend it to anybody..."
4,Conair infinity two jobs in one,I love this product. It straightens as it dries. I was looking for a wet dry straightener this one does the job. I do agree for medium length hair. My hair is longer and thick so it takes a while to finish. The results are worth it
2,BLOW DRYER WITH COMB,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR ALMOST 40 BUCKS, IT WORKED FINE FIRST. AFTER FOUR MONTHS IT DIED ON ME, DO I TRASHED IT. IT WAS GOOD FOR THE TIME BEING. I GAVE IT LESS STARS FOR THE LACK OF LIFE. I DID NOT USE IT EVERY DAY. I HAVE REALLY LONG THICK CURLY HAIR AND IT WAS EASY AND QUICK TO USE, INSTEAD OF USING MY IRON ON THE IRONING BOARD. EVEN THAT REALLY WORKS ON STEAM SETTING AND MY HAIR STRAIGHTENS MUCH FASTER THE ROOTS WOULD STAY CURLY WITHOUT A HAIR APPLIANCE.I WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR A SHORT TERM SOLUTION OR A TWENTY DOLLAR BLOW DRYER WITH A COMB WILL LAST YOU MUCH LONGER AND YOU CAN GET THE COMB AS A REPLACEMENT IN BEAUTY STORES...."
4,Works ok,"If you're buying this product with the intension to use it as a dryer... well don't do it. It's not that powerful.My hair is thick so I had some doubts about it, but it works great as a straightener and a styler (just don't expect the same results as going to a hair salon). If you are not into spending a lot of time to do your hair this is the product for you."
1,"worked great, but burned out",This worked great until it suddenly started blowing less air and a burning smell came from it and really irritated my lungs for a few minutes. I have never had lung problems. I bought a second one and the same thing happened.
3,Works great - when it works,"I love what this does with my hair. I'm in my 30s and don't want my hair completely flat ironed like a teen, but want it slick with the frizzies tamed. This does the job and my hair is thick and curly. However, after about four months it started overheating and stopped blowing much air. Now it's been six months and it finally died completely. So get it -- but get a warranty!"
1,Horrible,"This product was a completely disappointing i hate it . it does nothing it says it does .It does nothing for my hair , it does not straighten it , it leaves it looking dull and wavy ."
2,Disappointing,"Great book, awesome topic, engaging interviews and cool live footage -- so, why was the movie so disappointing? Maybe it's because it was so disjointed and never put the various scenes in context (especially chronological context). Maybe it's because nearly every interviewee said the same thing -- all fans of hardcore punk were losers/outcasts (not true!), the scene was a reaction against the oppressive climate in the early '80s, including Fleetwood Mac, disco, ""coke snorting Hollywood types"" (these parts made me cringe -- so did the interviews with guys like Keith Morris, who reveal themselves in their old age to be inarticulate burnouts). I agree with the other posts as well -- no DKs? no Misfits? no Husker Du?. It's like Hardcore for Dummies, but since the movie never scratches below the surface and never presents the material in a coherent manner, even dummies won't be any smarter about the topic after watching it! Hopefully, someone will do it right one day."
1,Not good for watercolor after dry,I purchased this ink thinking it would be perfect for sketching before watercolorwashes. It seems to lay on top of the paper and runs after drying it for a day. It's a bit glorpy in consistency. I'm not seeing all the great things people havesaid about this ink.
2,Too thin,"I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray."
5,Practically perfect in every way,"This game is awesome. It is so simple that my 5yo and 3yo can play it together alone. It is highly imaginative and inspires a lot of creativity - the stuff my kids have come up with trying to save that princess has been hilarious and also demonstrates some really great problem-solving. There is no one winner - we either all win or all lose, which is great for eliminating fighting. In short, the kids love it, I love it, and they don't need me to play it, which - if you are a mom - you know is priceless. #winning"
2,Make sure it fits....,I ordered one of these for my subaru- didn't even come CLOSE to fitting properly. It's the usual cheap automotive grade carpet as well. Avoid and get something you can see in person and make sure fits.
4,Me:Possibly the only one who liked it...,"Yes ladies and gentlemen,there is someone who liked it.ME!I didnt notice any similarities between the ending and 2001.Well okay,some similarities with the FTL sequense but thats it.And Freddy is a bit like HAL9000 but more human.The sub-plot on earth is pretty useless except for the ending.But i liked Jack Palances character.And theres good acting in this movie also,even Charlton Heston is better than they say."
2,Poor chapter indexing,"I bought this DVD because, many years ago, I worked on this film. Because I use it to teach a class, I have had the VHS version for many years. I thought that I would get into the 21st century and buy the DVD, in hopes that I could access the scenes I needed for the class quicker. Because the chapter index is very skimpy, I have to use a combination of the DVD an the VHS tape for the class. It sure beats winding and rewinding to get to the scenes I need but it sure would've been nice to have a bigger index. P.S. - yes, it's an awful movie but I didn't write it or act in it but it paid my rent."
5,Best kept secret,Best kept secret in the dvd world is this film here. One of the best film noir's of the century. A great mystery with lots of fun and subtle humor.
3,My 4 yo son likes it but.....,"The pieces didn't go together as easily, but they did come apart easily. My 4 yo son isn't as adept at building as my older son is (my 6 yo is already into big Lego sets). So he needed a little help from me, especially with putting the railings in place. Once it was done, he liked it alot. It isn't quite as nice as the pirate ship his big brother has, but he loves playing with it now. The material is quite durable for a boy his age, so this will suit him just fine until he is a little older and learns to take care of something more intricate."
5,The Psychic Healing Book,"This book contains simple, straight forward information about how to understand and utilize your psychic abilities. It is helpful for beginners and practioners alike, as it covers a great deal territory on just about any subject you can think of in the psychic arena. Most important of all, it teaches the ethics and responsibilities of being psychic, far too many books leave out this important information, which can lead to all kinds of complications for the unwary. So if you are a seeker, looking for information on being psychic and what it means to be psychic, as well as how to get started on this path, this is your book. I am a practicing psychic and this is one of the books I recommend to my clients."
5,TF is simply the best!,"For those who like Beast Wars/Machines (there must be some of you weirdo's out there), those who enjoyed the Transformers in the 80's, those who would like some good non-anime cartoon action, or for those who simply want something good to watch, these Transformer volumes are what you're looking for. Like the first nine installments, these episodes get you aquainted with the greats of TF lore, and provide enough familiarity to make watching TF: The Movie the joy it was supposed to be. It's also a lot better than those Beast spin-offs, in case I didn't make that clear. Transform, and ROLL OUT!"
1,frustrating and painful to read,"I have never been so negatively moved by a book that i felt it was my duty to inform others of its stink. the character in this book was a horrible human being, and as i read on (yes i did read the whole thing) i expected that there was some way she would redeem herself in the end. i was dumbfounded to discover there was no growth or emotional arc for this character. it was frustrating to read, and i am mad at myself for giving it the chance that i did. i bought this book special for a beach reading vacation, and feel slighted that it was in my suitcase at all...i waste of time, even while reading it poolside..."
1,Reasons why not to read this book:,"1. No plot2. No character3. No originality4. No wit5. No way!I'm surprised Helen Fielding hasn't sued yet. What Fielding did with Bridget Jones is far superior to this obvious knockoff. Emily, the main character here, does little more than spew insights about the previous men in her life. This is not riveting reading, folks. There is none of the sparkling introspection of Bridget Jones, and the fact that Emily has the requisite female friend duo and the gay male sidekick only serves to further diminish the originality of this pale imitation."
1,Absolute Dreck,"I love well-written chick lit books by the likes of Sophie Kinsella and Emily Giffin. I found Emily's Reasons in the bargain bin at Target and picked it up. The lack of even ONE positive review on the cover or inside the book should have been a tip off (the only endorsement is a lukewarm quote from Brittany Murphy), but I purchased it anyway. As another reviewer noted, the character is unlikable, and the book is so poorly written and edited that it is rendered unreadable. If the TV show was as bad as the book, it's no wonder it was cancelled after one ep. The bigger mystery is who was dumb enough to option this tome as a TV series . . ."
2,Seriously?!?!?,"This book wanted to make me scream. I like my books light and fluffy and do not mind detaching from reality to get into a book. But this was absolutely insane, I cannot believe I managed to finish the book. Emily is not really a very likable character and so spineless and wussy that I couldn't take her."
4,Transformers--The Movie,This is a Christmas gift for our grandson. We were pleased with the shipping time and assume it will be a good buy as all our other Amazon buys have been.
2,forgive me.............,"Ok, ok, I realize that I am going to be fried for this but here goes.......I loved this movie as a child. I worshiped the TV series and I still have quite the collection of Autobots, and Decepticons. However, when my friend got me this film for my birthday, I watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore. I think this film better served its purpose in the 80's, and is truly lost in today's modern era of animation. I would, however, like to see this film remade with better animation, and a FAR better soundtrack. I love the toys, but I did not like this movie."
2,not what i paid for,the movie that i recieved was stated to be very new or close to new when i recieved it there were more scrats on it then i have seen on most very used dvd's. i was very disappointed with it it if wouldnt for the fact my sons birthday was the day before i recieved it i would have returned it due to the marks on it!
4,"Love the widescreen remastering, looks great, like the triva,.","Always a huge fan of the transformer, the movie is just a classic. Yeah, now that I am older I can see some flaws and cheesyness to the whole plot and things, but I still love it. I feel just like a kid again. Overall, a great piece of work at the cutting edge for it's time. I do think they could have done more in depth documentary stuff for this set. I know one thing missing that I thought was funny on the first DVD release was the fact that they mentioned how the movie boogie nights asked them for rights to use ""the touch"", this was not on this version. Sony did a good job on the remaster, and I look foreward to the Cartoons remastering soon and hopefully being released some time early next year."
3,Not as good as the tv series,TV series is much better. This movie gets bogged down in new characters that aren't developed or even known of in a seemingly marketing ploy to sell more/newer TF toys.
4,The Transformers - The Movie (20th Anniversary Special Edition),If you are a transformers fan this is a must.
1,Alert alert! Not compatible with Mac!,"This DVD disc was not recognized on my Apple PowerBook G3 Firewire. The DVD drive tried to spin the disc up but gave up after a few seconds. There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and ""df -k"" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season 1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible. Major disappointment, since I own the Canadian VHS version of TFTM (containg that four-letter word) and was really looking forward to owning the uncensored edition on DVD."
1,how to TRANSFORM a good movie into a bad one,"I was really looking forward in seeing this movie. I have just started to get into the ""ANIME"" thing and have seen some good movies but this movie really stinks. Maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I dont think so. I have seen some [bad] movies in my time and this one ranks within the top 10. Dont waste your time on this, go outside and watch the grass grow instead...it will be more entertaining that watching this piece of trash."
5,Possibly the best cartoon movie of all time,With a great cast of voices and the theme of TransFormers you can't go wrong. This movie has everything that anybody could want. Not to mention the jammin' 80's rock that accompanies it.
5,Important Notice Cartoon Fans,"I grew up in the era of G.I.Joe, Thudercats, Voltron, and The Transformers. Now they've got Pokemon, and Barney. Sissy cartoons- with no real storyline. Do your kids a favor, buy this movie. Vote for it to be formatted to DVD. This movie has a great storyline, theme, and plot. The animation is crisp & flowing. I own the soundtrack as well and let me tell you, it rocks, and it's perfectly mixed into the movie. My friends- this is a breakthrough movie!"
1,Not a true Widescreen Format!!!,"Transformers The Movie is my favorite animated movie of all time. I was excited to learn this 20th anniversary edition was coming out. When I played it, I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, and is worthy of all 5 stars. My low rating is because of the ""widescreen format."" The 16:9 format is NOT the theatrical version. It is merely the full screen version with the top and bottom trimmed off. If you don't believe me, look at the full screen version side by side with the ""wide screen"" version. It does have some great extra features, and the color is cleaned up, but this is not what is advertised on the box. If you are purchasing this for the full screen version or the special features, you'll be fine, but if you want the true widescreen version, you will be disappointed like me. Buyers beware."
2,a movie? no. 80 minute commercial yes,"i remeber watching this movie at my cousins house. i was a huge fan of them, so when i came to amazon and found it on DVD i bought it. so i get it play it, and 80 minutes later i realise i just wasted a lot of money. this movie has a realy bad story, BAD music and bad plotholes. the animations good though"
5,This movie is GREAT!,This is definately the best cartoon movie of all time. This movie has influenced my childhood more than anything I can think of besides obviously my parents. DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS MOVIE
2,Awfully Bad,"Transformers: The Movie was disappointing. I was in high school when they came out in the early '80s. Hey, I love cartoons. But in '86, the Transformers started to change in the series, and it continued in the movie.Unless you love everything about the Transformers don't see this movie. If you love the cartoon before Optimus Prime dies, don't see this movie.I gave it two stars, because unlike the other reviewers, I saw it in the theatre when it came out in the summer of '86. The price was worth it to see the cartoon in a wide screen and with the dolby-enhanced sound."
3,Something fishy....,"The movie is great. Has a real good story and for once they show some of the good guys getting hurt and not only the bad guys. However, upon receiving the video, I discovered some faults. One is that the video box is not the original box they used when it was still on retail stores. It's more like a generic box with a color photo copy of the original cover stuck on it. Another is that the video doesn't seem authentic since it was FHP productions that was the first to release the movie on VHS and not this Kid Rhino company. So if you just want to see the movie and don't care much about it's authenticity, then buy it. It's a real good movie to watch and it touches the heart. However if you are a anime buff and just didn't get a copy and do want one, I wouldn't recommend getting this copy."
5,The best anime of all time,"by far, the best anime movie I've ever seen. If I could, I would give it more stars. you must see this movie!"
4,THIS MOVIE IS THE GREATEST,THIS MOVIE IS THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. HOWEVER GREAT CHARACTERS DIE IN THIS MOVIE OPTIMUS PRIME PROWL AND IRONHIDE AMONG OTHERS. ALL TRANSFORMERS FIGHT THE GREATEST EVIL EVER KNOWN IN UNICRON WHO MAKES MEGATRON AND GALVATRON WHO ARE THE SAME ROBOT LOOK LIKE GOOD HEARTED SOULS. WE SEE A NEW AUTOBOT LEADER COME IN THIS MOVE RODIMUS PRIME FROM HOT ROD. AND TONS OF NEW CHARACTERS TOO.GO OUT AND GET THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVE THE TRANSFORMERS IT IS WELL WORTH IT.
4,transformers the movie review,this movie is good but it cuss two times and it has lots of violence and it has a song called dare to be stupid in my opinion this is age appropriate for ages 10 and up
2,Just advanced applications,"Unfortunately , this version of the famous Hamilton's book contains only the second volume of the entire book (one can see inside the words ""Volume 2"" and ""Book 3"" in it's first pages), so all the basic definitions about quaternions are not present there. Only the more advanced applications of quaternions (the last part of Hamilton's original work) can be found on it. I bought this book and it hadn't a practical use for me, so I had to download the full version from internet, in pdf form, by free, in order to find what I was looking for. Result: I donated this book for our library, perhaps someone have the first part of the original work and can use this book...But I think this is waist of money for most of us..."
4,What happened to the voice of the public in politics and society?,"Dewey, in response to Lippmann (phantom public), gives a diagnosis of what is wrong with today's fading public participation and incentive to act in politics. I do not rate this book five stars only because he gives a vague description of exactly how these conditions to upturn public voice can be met. Overall it is an excellent book for those interested in modern public issues."
3,Like MKSAP 4,"I would refer you to my review of MKSAP 4 for more infomration. This book is a little more difficult than MKSAP 4, but has the same jive."
1,"The ""dumbing down"" continues.","We lament the ""dumbing down of America"", yet books like this one, with conclusions reached in advance of writing and research, deceptive ""citations"" of authority, syllogistic reasoning, and outright lies contained therein, continue to sell like hotcakes. All of this proves little more than that Darwin was probably right. Many men are DESCENDED from the higher apes."
1,Nightmarish and Surreal,"I have to disagree with [a] reviewer , as this film deserves every bit of scorn heaped upon it and then some. Pity the poor cast as they try to maintain the illusion that the ghoulish, octagenerian Ms. West is some kind of a sex symbol. Run for ear plugs as she and Mr. Dalton mutilate ""Love will keep us together"" (not the best song to begin with but it deserves better than this). Recoil in horror as the reanimated corpse of Mae West spouts sexual innuendos that were stale 60 years before this film was made!Of course, even without Ms. West dottering around the set this movie would be unwatchable. The screenplay is dreck and it was seemingly directed by Helen Keller.I watched this movie on a dare, and I'm convinced that God has knocked some time of my upcoming sentence in Purgatory because of it. Unless horrifically bad movies are your hobby this is to be avoided like the plague."
1,Terrific cast.........terrible movie,"Where to begin...I'm a big fan of Mae West and I was really looking forward to this movie. As far as I was concerned, it couldn't miss: A musical with Timothy Dalton singing, Mae West as a spy, Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper. What could go wrong? Everything went wrong. I was embarrassed for the actors. This movie goes beyond camp. Very disappointing.I purchased this movie while I was working in the Middle East and as far as I know, its still in some land fill over there. I gave it 1 star only because there isn't a lower rating. Mae West once said that she didn't want Myra Breckinridge to be her last film. Much better than this drivel."
2,BAD DVD,"Well, ya get what you pay for! And ten bucks ain't gonna get ya much! Not in this case anyway. Watchable print but faded color and really BAD sound with loud buzz. But if your a West fan you better grab it. It is doubtful that this film will ever be re-stored."
2,WHo Said Life ENDS After 80?,"When most people over 80 are locked in old age homes, orsitting on a chair 24/7, or layin in bed all day living their final years, In SEXTETTE, Mae West proved that ""Life Doesnt ENDafter 80!"" Although in most parts she looked and walked andtalked like is she was a zombified embalmed corpse, she lookedlike she was enjoying herself. The movie is stupid and silly, butit is amazing to watch Mae in her 80's, with all those heavycostumes strugglin thru her lines. Above all, the movie is just'silly fun'. You'll enjoy it."
2,disappointed with the book,"I found a number of mistakes, both in code, and in printing. The book is absolutely for novices. I breezed through the entire 41 chapters of the book in just one weekend. And yet it lacks many details, even those which I consider basic, and should have been covered. I really think, with all due respect to the author, that he bombed it this time. Nothing is treated in completeness. The material the book provides can easily be had for free from a number of tutorials on the internet, if you type c# tutorial in google. I just liked the first four paragraphs of the first chapter, because they show my sentiments of being a programmer."
4,"Another Solid Effort From Smith, Tho Not His Best","First off, don't read this before its predecessor, ""A Falcon Flies."" All characters here are introduced in that book, the first of a four-book series on the Ballantynes. The first book is about the African slave trade, thickly larded with much sex and violence. This one's a bit better-- it follows lead character Zouga Ballantyne to the diamond fields of Kimberly, where he swears to make his fortune. We meet his sons and follow their adventures as well-- the book is best when it looks at the African tribes that must deal with white encroachment in the latter part of the 19th century. Smith writes gritty adventures/soap operas that entertain and inform, and while this one is good, it's not quite up to the standards of the Courtney novels, beginning with ""Birds of Prey."" Read that one first; if it piques your interest, you'll want to read the next 11 books in that series, then come back to try the Ballantynes...."
2,Poor Quality,"Be careful when you order used books - this one had no glue on the spine, when you tried to read it the pages just fell out, and we discovered some of the pages were gone. It's not a bargain when you have to pay postage for something that doesn't work!"
4,Tuning In: Frequency Is A Winner!,"Freqency. 2 words for you out there. Very Unexpecting. Ever imagine of communicating into the future when you were a kid? If yes, go back into those dreams wiith this movie. Grab our wife or kids, and sit down to enjoy this thriller. It will amaze and entertain you. So many people will promise you."
3,Not too bad But not a classic,An interesting twist to time travel. I recommend it as a rent not a purchase.
4,!,"This was a great thriller. It features making amends with your past, suspense, humor, and values, and combines them well. The movie features a cop who, due to a natural phenomenon, finds himself able to communicate with his father-who died 30 years ago battling a fire in a warehouse. He manages to convince him that he is telling the truth, and, as a result, the father survives the fire. However, this complicates things when, as a result, a killer survives and manages to kill more people. They have to work together to solve the mystery and stop him in this first-rate thriller. I think this was a good movie. You will like it too. Watch for the ""yahoo"" line. The movie was well-cast and executed."
2,"Interesting concept, bad execution.",This film suffers from some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a modern film -- so fake looking that its distracting! This film also suffers from that long-standing cliche of the hero being saved at the last minute by the mystery gunshot out of nowhere. I hate that!
5,What a suprise!,I didn't expect much of this movie but I was pleasantly suprised. This movie actually touched me. This is something that rarely happens because I am usually into action movies like Predator and Die Hard. I wish I saw this one in the theater. I'm glad to have it on Dvd though. The extras are great.
1,"Simply, pathetic.",This is another example of Hollywood at its worst. The premise is just hard to swallow. The dialogues and story all conspire to make a joke of a movie. You have turn off your brain to see this one. It is rather pathetic.
4,Fun Science Fiction,"This movie is a feel good, science fiction movie with a murder mystery and plenty of action woven into it."
4,The Cinematic Vision of Sun Ra,"The early-1970s was a tumultuous time in American politics and the world landscape. Sun Ra weaves the political controversies with sci-fi and mythology for this 82 minute film that had a very limited run when initially released in 1974. There is a universal message in Sun Ra's production, with the music - released in a soundtrack - making for an outstanding package.Though available in often shoddy bootlegs, this DVD is a fitting tribute to the cinematic vision of an artistic genius."
5,Cat rocks!,"MEOW~! When I first read Catspaw I was about 12 or 13...and I really didn't get what was going on, but I LOVED Cat. He's so cute...He reminds me a lot of the charactors that I create now...ANYWAY, I re-read it again a couple days ago and finally understood the plot. DANG good book. It was the first of the series I read, and I'm re-reading Psion right now (it's sitting by my computer to read while the net loads!) Catspaw is most definatly the best in the series...(although Dreamfall made me cry!) Hey, I'd love to talk to Catspaw fans...write me?"
3,Without the a.k.a. printing on the the photo datas it's too bland.,"As I found out when I had first bought the DVD which had plain color back drop intros instead of the a.k.a. printing on the photos datas it's too bland with that very essence being stripped bare and doesn't make the follow-ups appear to be just as appealing.so until I find out it's released the very way it was 1st seen on CBS-TV on May 24,1995 I just won't want it.What's also edited out of this feature from when it was first on tv is the audio intro by the ""Mother"" of ""This is our first reunion since the girls 'got married.' "" of which of course goes without saying that it's sarcastic and serious at once.Also in the true Brady Tradition of of cynicism and sarcasm but a new touch of seriousness added to it."
4,good DVD,"It got here a little late, but was very inexpensive and worked just fine! Overall this was a good buy. My friend loved it."
2,Not ideal by a longshot,"Solitary Witch is a collection of information, some good, some bad, spliced together with Silver Ravenwolf's quick-fix low theology Wicca lite.I gave it two stars, instead of one, because it shows that perhaps Ravenwolf has been listening to her community. She still gets many things wrong-NOT ALL WITCHES ARE WICCAN, for example, but she seems to be trying.I would recommend anything by Cunningham, Buckland or Dunwich above this book, but if you are a teen who, for whatever reason, feels you need a dumbed down teen book, this is heads and tails over ""Teen Witch"" for quality.That being said, I feel the target age for this book is about 11-12, and I'm not sure it's appropriate for that age. As a mother of teens, if I gave it to my girls, they'd be offended.That, with all the other problems with Ravenwolf makes this a good book to pass over.Kids don't need Wicca dumbed down or misrepresented, they are just as capable of reading Cunningham as any of us old farts."
4,A Bit Misleading,"This book IS another great one in Silver's collection, and it fits the same from the heart style we're all used to. It has loads of information and a lot of research useful to anyone. However, this book recieved only 4 stars from me because this book seems geared towards teens again(spells for lockers,teachers,acne,crushes)and nothing in its desciption or preface elludes to that. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and she does have plenty of info for adults, but I was expecting an adult title and it seems like she is talking straight to young adults. But it is a great addition to any collection, and I do recommend it if you like Silver's other titles."
5,A Excellent Book by Silver,"This is definitely a nice comprehensive book for any pagan book collection. You'll find practical advice to deal with everyday problems, myths, spells, different ways to cast circles, how to set up your altar, how to cleanse your altar, it just goes on and on. It's definitely something that everyone should have access to as it's a resource everyone needs."
4,"Great info, but cluttered","This book has a LOT of great information on a wide variety of topics. It gives a good introduction and info on each subject, so this book is good for the experienced practitioner and beginner. ""Solitary Witch"" offers some really great exercises, rituals, spells, and meditations.The only thing I don't like is it's set up. The info is scattered all around the book, which can be very confusing at times.All in all, this book is worth the money!"
2,And One More Time With feeling....,"How many times can the same thing be said in a different way? Well, apparently at least one more time. I have to admit that this book is not as sappy as the author's usual work. And although Silver's writings appear to still be targeting the Teen Market, this book is not as ""dumbed down"" as we've seen from her in the past. Still, I have to cringe at some of the topics covered in this book (like spells for acne).All that aside, this book seems better thought out than Silver's past books. And there is a small trace of an attempt to bring balance to this work regarding historical perspectives. For a teen's book, this one is not as bad as others we've seen. But, ""not so bad"" isn't really what we should accept or encourage from writers in our community. But that's just my opinon, I could be wrong."
2,Disappointing quality,"While this game is fun to play, and my children enjoy the secret door aspect of the game, the quality of the product is really, really poor. The board itself arrived warped and buckled with the house glued on it crookedly. At least half the playing pieces tore as we took them apart. Definitely not built to last."
2,"I love Tolstoy, but...","I kept waiting for Tolstoy to get off the soapbox, but it never happened. The writing is classic, and the characterization very easy to follow. But the payoff was lacking -- it seemed to me that the book was more interested in making a point (which I think was Tolstoy's object anyway) than actually having a book that provides a true novel experience. I suppose my review expresses my disappointment, as Tolstoy is one of my all-time favorite writers."
5,"Dead to the world, Satan has come!",The video contains a 1996 documentary of the controversial Antichrist Superstar tour. The video features 10 songs from the Antichrist Superstar album and the albums before it. Manson delivers a chaotic performance through every one of the songs.Aside from the live performances there are also segments of behind the scenes footage of the band as well as the protesters who tried so very hard to stop the show from happening. Manson briefly states his philosophy in his commentaries.See U In The Future...
4,Good,"One of the best concert films of the year. I watched it with my mom and she even liked it. It shows alot of backstage scenes that (normal) people rarely ever see. The only disapointment was that the ""live"" songs were obviously dubbed, and during the interview sequences, Mr. Manson's voice was distorted. But other than those little pet peeves, it was a great video worth every penny. The shots of the live performance were so close that you'd have to be a band member to get that close. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Manson. END"
5,MANSON,"MANSON REALLY IS THE GREATEST!HE DEFINITELY KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM,AND HOW TO DO A CONCERT!ON THIS TAPE-HE HAS FIRE,HE WALKS ON HIS HIGH STILTS,AND HE SITS ON SOMETHING REALLY HIGH-JUST TO MENTION A FEW THINGS.GET THIS TAPE AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHAT MANSON CAN DO!YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
4,"Winchester 3""","Knife is sturdy and sharp. Full steal body with wood decoration. Might require some cleaning upon arrival.4 years later:Awesome knife with a very sturdy construction. I've been using this for the past 16 months in Dominica for just about everything, from cutting rope, making designs on paper, to cutting open young coconuts for coconut water. This knife has been through hell and back... and still works just as it did the day I bought it.I also take very good care of it though. I don't over-sharpen the knife, and I clean it after every use."
5,A True Gem,"This book gives an amazing view into the heart and mind of a girl, Ivy, born in the Appalachians of southern Virginia. You see the world through letters she writes during her entire life. The ""misspellings"" and local dialect contribute much to the tale. You are gradually taken into her world. It is a masterful piece of writing that draws you inevitably to the conclusion. A wonderful, sensitive book!"
4,Loved it!,This novel left me wanting to go sit and visit with Ivy Rowe - I know her that well after reading her letters. She is an old friend that I will miss dearly.
5,best security system on the market right now,"I've installed a half-dozen different security systems and after using the Elk M1G, I will never mess with another, inferior system. This technology is light years ahead of everybody else. Forget ADT, GE, DSC and all the others. Their systems are slow and buggy and inferior compared to Elk. It's expensive, but worth it.However, I still think there's room for improvement. Elk is the best system that I've found that's currently available. I still think the alarm industry is 10 years behind everybody else. Someone could come along and create something much better and become rich."
5,gypsy punk?,"Gypsy jazz chanson and more blend with punk energy in this disc...its hard to describe with French vocals over acoustic guitars, pianos, upright bass, brass, fiddle, accordian and more sound when combined...Fans of music in general will like this..."
1,Not a good purchase,I bought this for my dads birthday. He and my mom were going to try it out. They said it was 'interesting' and also terrible. :( :(
4,Sunrise Tai Chi,"I'm new to Tai Chi so didn't know just what to expect from a DVD of the subject but I'm pleased with Sunrise Tai Chi (YMAA). It will take some time to learn all the ""moves"" but feel confident that the instructional part of the DVD will teach me. I purchased Gentle Tai Chi at the same time. I have reviewed that separately."
4,Was ok nothing to wright home about,This book seemed to be longer than it needed to be but all and all was a good read Was easy to follow just long to read i like fast reads
1,Warning,Mel Torme wrote a very vicious and innaccurate book about Judy Garland on the set of the tv series. He takes a shot at her in this book as well. He has told nothing but lies about Judy so how much truth is he telling in his own life and about others?.It's about time someone else wrote a definative book on Torme.
1,OUTDATED RIPOFF,Modifications in this book are for old model scanners from the early 90's.The publiser should pull this book!
3,Not his best,"I really enjoy Lewis Black...I have all his CDs now and I listen to them while commuting along with a couple other choice comedians. I have listened to his other CDs many, many times and they are still funny to me and I watch him do the same material if I catch him on TV.But, this is not up to par with his other work, I was really pretty disappointed. I will still listen to it, but it's not the place to start if you are looking for your first Lewis Black for your collection, start with any of the others."
3,A Good Movie Has Been Ruined By Rhino,The sound is terrible! I think the affects channel is on the right and the dialog on the left. The video quality is worse than VHS! How could Rhino do this to such a classic movie?
5,Timeless and Inspiring,"Read this book and be changed. A friend gave me this book 16 year ago, and I have read it at least once every two years since. It is a magical and philosophical read that will cause you to rexamine your life and renew your sense of self purpose in a way that no other book will. Beyond that, the story is entertaining, engaging and beautifully written. I'm on the site now to send it to a friend who I suspect needs to read it. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't at least be intrigued by the book's premise, if not utterly changed by it."
5,Amazing. Still holds up.,"The Court Jester is a classic, solid comedy, wordplay, slapstick, it's brilliant. I can see why it became a national treasure."
4,Jest Wonderful,"Possibly the funniest musical comedy ever made. Even if you are not a Danny Kaye fan, you should try this movie. Don't be put off by the opening sequence, which looks rather dated now. The film contains some excruciatingly funny scenes, including the classic ""Flagon with the dragon"" routine. This is Kaye at his brilliant best.The story (set in a mediaeval England which cheerfully makes no attempt at historical accuracy) is remarkably solid and complex, which helps maintain the film's brisk pace.So when you are in the mood for some good old-fashioned fun, put your feet up and summon ""The Court Jester"".Update: I recently watched this movie again and I think my original 4-star rating was wrong. This is a 5-star classic."
5,Danny Kaye is an amazing actor!,I remember this from my younger days. It was great to discover it again on Amazon Prime. I loved it so much I bought it so I could enjoy it again and again.Danny Kaye's acting talent really shines through in this movie. There are some hilarious skits and twists of the tongue.I highly recommend this movie.
4,...a great CD,"...'Day for Night' really gets you going, and the subsequent 'Skin' and 'Distance to the Sun' are classics.This band is uneven in it's delivery at times, however knowing full well where the influences are ...I respect them for keeping the progressive rock theme and spirit going, tossing away the commercial ... Some great progessive rock that is all their own. At times this CD may drag, but they pull it together in the end (the 'shoes' suite). Some folk hate Neal Morse's voice, but as long as he doesn't stretch it too far beyone his real capabilities, he sounds great. It is hardly an offensive one ...- one that you can easily associate with smooth, prog rock. ...."
4,I'd tell every health teacher to show it.,"This is an amazing movie. However, it overlooks middle-class and upper middle-class kids with the same problems, but it shows reality at its best and worst. It's a movie I've seen many times, and will see many more. This is a movie I would recommend a health teacher to show in class. It shows what's really going on. It exaggerates , and faces reality. It deserves ""four stars."""
5,A Very Good Movie,"Larry Clark's KIDS is a film that many people will not like do to the exsplist scenes in the film and I am shere there are many other reason people will not like this film. But I like it its so true and honest there are times you will want to turn away from the film but you just can't thats what gives the film a surrel feel. But this is a film I think aduls should see it will surprise them.Warning: This film is unrated for extremly strong rape scenes including sex scenes,graphic drug use,extremly strong violence, and other thematic elements."
4,about the movie Kids......,"This movie/film is basically talking about the life style of 'that' group of tennager or kids in their everyday life. There are certain things that is mentioned in this movie/film which I will nver say is never out of the course but this will give people a more clearer picture of how the 'that' live their tennage/kids life when the country uses the 'open' method to run. What I could speak out is that most of the erotic portion of the movie were mostlly using their pictures which I think South-East Asian 'that' have yet to start with this. This is what I feel that western 'that' advanced first. This is still a good piece of film, whatever it is. This recommendation is for those whom are interested in this Genre of movie/film.N/B: The 'that' comes with the 'thief' thing above the 'killer' or 'papa' thing as there are amny movie/films in R format. This also applies to other countries beside western."
4,fiction or reality?,"After reading the reviews of many on kids,... I dont find anything in the movie to be a surprise. Raves, extacy, sex, drugs and drinking stretch further than the ""non-parent"" city youths shown in the movie. Its everywhere. Anyone who thinks this movie is ""shocking"" or not right in any way needs to get out of thier bubble and look around. Kids smoke weed, drink, do drugs, smoke blunts, eat extacy and have sex. Its just taboo in some areas. But, to most teenagers thats just reality."
5,best documentary,"The first itme I saw this movie, I was probably about 12. It taught me about the consequenses of unprotected sex. And it's fun to watch, I have never enjoyed a documentary so much. It it actaully realistic, compared to most cheesy, homemade docs. I will always like this movie."
1,GET REAL !,"A great movie ?? I mean, get real ?? Have you seen the movie in theaters ? The words came out of the mouth about five seconds late. I agree that the subject is interesting and that the movie itself, the screenplay, is good. But the actors cant play. We dont understand what they ""say"", or more exactly grumble. I'm not saying Leo Di Carpaccio would have done better, just saying they should have given the Kids a few acting lessons before..."
1,This Movie Is Bad!,When I saw this movie i thought that it will be good but its bad.I do get the plot of this film but the sound and picture is no good.
5,Awesome Real Life Tale,"I only have three things to say, AMAZING, POWERFUL, and REAL. As an eighteen year old, I know what my highs chool life was like. Parties are where teens hook-up no matter what the consequences. Teens showing absolutely no brains or ocnscience is exactly like this movie and real life. I recommend this movie to any high schooler or teacher or even parent."
5,Real-life look into the life of teens,"This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these ""KIDS"". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens."
1,Arg.,I feel dumber after watching this film. I think it is one of the worst ever. I didn't want to spend my time watching a bunch of kids with speech impediments have sex like rabbits.
3,Decent exploitation movie. Worth watching...once,"This film opens with such an obvious and laughable set-up (reminiscent of some sort of cautionary sex-ed pamphlet) that it's hard to take anything that follows seriously. However, it's well done in parts, and it *is* realistic, if a wee bit overdone. There are some nice touches of character here and there. I kept wondering what the point of it was, though. There's no plot or anything particularly interesting going on. It's apparently supposed to be a ""message"" film, but what is the message? That kids like this exist? Anyone who's ever been to high school can tell you that. Most people have been around this sort of thing to one degree or another. Sure, it's shocking, in a cheap, exploitive way, to see graphic scenes of young kids boozing and doing drugs and having sex, but after an hour and a half, it all gets pretty boring. And that's the most shocking part of all."
3,Don't Confuse This Fiction with Reality,"As a former public school teacher in the South Bronx and long-time resident of East Harlem, I would advise readers of the accompanying naive reviews of Kids to remember that Kids is not a portrayal of the lives of the majority of New York's kids. Instead, it is a fictional pseudo-documentary involving the lives of a handful of amoral adolescents. Kids is a modern Clockwork Orange, but without the narrativity or theme; it a relatively dumbed-down and arguably irresponsible analysis of modern amorality. Kids in New York certainly face challenges in developing a sound sense of morality; they are surrounded with opportunities for instant pleasure, and often live in broken homes that allow them to explore these opportunities. But this film does not explore the challenging lives of such real New York kids."
4,Raw and intense.,This movie really makes you think. not for the faint of heart. very raw and direct. leaves you thinking at the end..
3,Interesting,"I prefer the writing style of Chapin, who has written a similar book, but this one isn't bad. I found the content of this book very interesting-even without prior knowledge of the subject-just a bit dry in its expression."
3,Enhanced version adds almost nothing,"I like the music, but save money and buy the normal version of this CD. No additional songs are recorded on the enhanced CD. The only additional track (Hero/Heroine Acoustic) is simply saved on the data portion of the CD at a relatively low bitrate (128 Kbps). Similarly, all the videos are saved as low resolution FLV files (exactly the same kind of file you get if you save the videos off of YouTube). You can put together the same stuff at a much lower price if you buy the normal version, save the videos off of YouTube, and buy the extra track off of your favorite digital music store."
5,An informational story!!!,An incredibly well written story of caring for a parent. A reliable story written by daughter. Very well done.
3,Poison,This film was shot in 12 days usually only allowing 1 or 2 takes. It was thrown together at last minute.That being said I believe that Kari as well as the rest of the cast could have developed the story with time.I wouldn't say it was the best but worth the watch.
3,As expected...,"Quite a throwaway erotic thriller only redeemed by the presence of Kari Wuhrer (much better than the Shannon Tweed original). Kari certainly has a talent for making R-rated movies and she shows that, quite literally, in this picture."
1,Apologizing for Jesus,"A popular but misguided approach to the, ""can't we all just get along"" pluralism of our day. When the non-believing Jews told Jesus their father was Abraham, he told them they were terribly mistaken. He said, ""If your father was Abraham you would have recognized me."" Instead he told them their real father was the devil. Jesus certainly wasn't being an anti-Semite, he was a Semite, but he was telling them the truth. The notion that we worship the same God as non-Christian Jews is no different than the idea of embracing all religions as equal. Christians need to stop apologizing for Jesus and understand that what divides us is much greater than what unites us, because what divides us is God. Jay Bugg"
1,"Never got it, never heard from them",I never received this product and have not heard from the vendor except to ask for a review.
2,Doesn't look as described.,It also wasn't shipped very well. It had cardboard as a bill protector and tape on both sides to keep it from falling out. Thankfully nothing happene to it but could of been more accurate on the description
2,Very fast for beginner,"I bought this CD to brush up on my high school french before going to France. The lessons move very quickly. There isn't much time to echo the response in French. Beginners may have trouble keeping up.Another drawback is that the entire CD is 2 tracks! The introduction is one track and the 14 lessons are the other track. This format makes it difficult to jump to a particular lesson. You either have to listen to the beginning or fast forward through the track to the time you want. I would recommend one of the other CDs like the ""Learn in Your Car"" series."
2,Sonar 6 - Are they all this way?,"I'm a big user of Adobe Audition. I used the old Cakewalk for midi and was always very fond of the program. So, I thought I'd try the new Cakewalk (Sonar). I really dislike this program. It's hard to use, hard to configure and is limits what hardware you can use. I'd sell this one and go back to my old cakewalk, however, i've already registered it. Oh well."
3,Society in those days,"They stroll, sip tea, visit friends unexpectedly, ah, society in those days. Other than that, this book isn't much of a reader. Emma was deathly dull, even with her match making fun."
3,Great story but so many words,"I used to read books like this when I was young and had more time, and I loved the stories. I have found that as an adult, wow, people used a LOT of words to say something simple back then.The story is the classic tale that I have long loved, but reading it is a bit tedious."
5,A Complex Heroine,"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"
1,Tee'd off with Crumpets,If you like a tale that's as pretentious and stuffy as a yacht club meeting then this book is right for you.
2,Didn't care for it,This was one of those books I had a hard time getting into. It just didn't captivate my interest. I did read it to the end only because I was curious about Emma and how it would end. I remember very little of it and it is a long novel. It took me 5 months to finish it. I usually finish a book in a few days once I get started. Also it was written in an Old English style and some of it I did not understand.I would only recommend it to someone who likes the Old English writing style.
4,one of Austen's better books,"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites. It can appear to be a little stilted due to the time period it was written in, but the story is timeless and that's why movies keep getting made with it as a base story."
2,I Hate Emma,I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
2,ugh,"I didn't enjoy reading this in college and I decided that now I was older I would have a better appreciation for the work. I know I'm ""supposed"" to love the classic literature of Jane Austen. I just really don't. This is one that is better in film IMHO."
4,classic yet egotistical young woman,Jane Austen's works are an extreme favorite of mine but this is not my favorite. Emma is really snobby and a meddler. Hers is not a personality I would want others to emulate but she is well meaning. Mr. Knightley is the best character of all. There are several very fun characters in this novel.
2,Too bland...,"This novel takes forever to get to the point of the story. I couldn't even finish it! Try PRIDE AND PREJUDICE instead - at least it has a plot. Speaking of which, I couldn't understand the plot of EMMA, if there even was one. Try another Austen book."
4,Minor,This is an enjoyable read. Since I have read other Jane Austen books this is turning into a good read too.
4,I thought it was a wonderful novel.,"This book is about a wonderful young woman named Emma Woodhouse, who is now the mistress of her father's house. This book shows Emma to be a warm, caring, sometimes misguided friend and local matchmaker. This book will take you on a journey through the wonderful world of the delightful Emma. Even though this book was sometime hard to read, I strongly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun reading experience."
5,oh please,"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"
5,Holland- as we'd like to imagine it!,"Fitch Perkins apparently wrote a whole series of books about twins in various countries. I read this aged 8 and adored it: it gives the young reader an idea of what the Netherlands was once like through the twins' adventures, with wonderful b/w illustrations. Getting their skates, celebrating St Nicholas' Day- and who could forget Kit falling in the dyke and getting pulled out by his baggy Dutch trousers? Or catching hold of a windmill's sails and being carried up in the sky. A great kids' book"
3,BROKEN ALREADY?!,"After ordering, i was please to find them at my house sooner than the estimated arrival. I unwrapped them, and admired their weight and sturdiness. I went outside with my brother and we clashed swords. I hear a snap crack and the black one has a splinter from the tip to the center, that i know is only going to get worse. So if your gonna hit softly these are good for you. However if you plan on really hitting I might not advise getting these."
3,Not what was expected,"I received my set of Bokken a day earlier than expected, which was great. The swords however were not what I expected. They were much cheaper looking than in the picture and one has a crack down the side. The natural color one looks like it will hold up real well but the black one is a little iffy. All in all, they were reasonable for the price."
5,One of my favs as a kid,"I was 2 when this came out, and I watched it all the time!! I loved it!! Just bought it for my nephew and niece, can't wait to watch it with them!!!"
5,one of the greatest animated features ever,"how dare anyone give this movie a bad rating. it is definitely one of the greatest animated features ever, right up there with the land before time, all dogs go to heaven, the lion king,an american tail, and finding nemo! anyone who didnt like this movie does not know what to look for in a classic animated film. they probably liked the land before time sequals, and prance around in a pink tu-tu. i give this movie five stars because of its:1. good message to kids about loyalty, bravery, and frienship.2. breakthrough in animation3. AMAZING SCORE!4. fun and yet thoughtful plot lineand 5. its ability to crawl into your heart, and make you fall in love with it, over and over again."
4,a sequel that lives up to the original,I loved the original and was actually afraid to see this one b/c i usually thing that sequels are bad ideas. I was wrong. This was as good if not better then the original. Essential for anyone who liked the original.
5,Simply adorable!,"I have always enjoyed Disney's animated films, but there are some that stand out. The Little Mermaid (both of them), The Lion King 2 (that's right, I said the sequel!), The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Cinderella, and the two Rescuer movies are the ones that come to mind. Now, the first Rescuer film is a hands-down favorite, but I love the sequel even more. Why? Because it has something the first one didn't--Jake the daring kangaroo rat. He has a crush on Bianca, and this upsets Bernard, whose trying to gather the courage to ask Bianca to marry him! So, the two boys end up glaring at each other and competing for the girl's attention, and she apparently doesn't notice the animosity. But it's just so cute! Jake is one of my all-time favorite characters, even if he is a stereotype of a guy from the Australian Outback. I love Jake!"
5,A great first game for kids!,"This game is so great for many reasons. It teaches cooperation as everyone has to take turns and work together to plant the garden before the sun sets. It teaches directions; I sometimes go over clockwise and counter-clockwise with the kids before the game. It helps with imagination, you can make up your own poses. It helps with self esteem, everyone gets a chance to be the teacher by doing the pose first. There is counting as kids hold the pose, we all count. It teaches motor skills - moving around the board as well as throwing the die. It teaches simple, fun yoga poses so there is movement within the game. I think 6 players would be the maximum because little kids get bored if they have to wait too long for their turn. You can also stop in the middle of the game and practice other yoga poses then go back and finish the game. Namaste!"
3,Age of exploration-Great Ages of Man,"Came in great condition, working on completing the series. I'm looking forward to going through each book in the series, because of my overall interest in history."
3,I've read much better inspection books than this one.,There are a lot of books about home inspectors and the inspection process that I have read and are much better than this book. ASHI has books that tell a lot more details and cover all the topics left out by this book. I am an ASHI certified home inspector so I am experienced in this field and know when I'm reading a good book on the subject. This book does not tell the whole story needed for a professional inspector and appears to be written for a beginner who only wants a basic understanding on home inspections and inspectors.I've been an ASHI home inspector for many years and wouldn't recommend this book to any of inspectors in my state. Shop around and you'll find much better reading to be informed.
4,Good Info,"If you are buying a house for yourself, you need to get a professional inspection no matter what. This book will give you understanding of what an inspector looks for. This book is very useful if you are in rehab business and want to get an idea of the extent of work needed to be done prior to committing yourself to a professional inspection."
2,Cool Sporty,"I got this DVD at the bargain price of US$10 and I'm not about to complain about it.The story is OK, the cast does their best, Amy gets to kick the daylights out of the bad guy!Hey it's OK. There's also some motorcycles in it at least and I love motorbikes. Amy rides a cool Sporty she got from a guy she picked up after a job (I think she keeps the bike when she kicks him out). The Bad Guy rides a badder bike off-course. Amy is pretty and takes her clothes of once so that's another plus."
4,SO MUCH MORE FUN than other preschool board games,"My preschool age daughter loves board games, but I can only take so much of Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, or Hi Ho Cherry-O. Max is so much better than the ""regular"" board games you find at stores like Target. The objective of this game is to get the squirrel, mouse, and bird to safety before the cat Max gets to them. You roll the dice to determine if Max moves or the little creatures move. When Max gets too close, you can call him back to the starting point for a treat. Kids and adults can work together to try to get the little creatures to safety. My preschool age daughter has no trouble figuring out the rules and she enjoys calling Max back for a treat. Like I mentioned before, some preschool games get old real quick for adults, but Max is entertaining for all ages. The only complaint that I have is that the pieces are made of cardboard paper. I think it would be more appealing and durable if they have little plastic figures for the animals."
2,Animal Farm the cartoon,"The book animal farm was written over 60 years ago and has recently been placed in the top 100 books ever, has been turned into a cartoon for the children's film of the same name. The book was famous for mocking the Russian revolution. This is no longer visible in the film And in the eyes of a child they would have no idea what it is linked with. The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD to show to my English classes after reading the George Orwell novel Animal Farm. I was very disappointed; it is very corny, and the end deviates from the novel quite a bit. It is as if they didn't get the meaning or point of the novel at all. I am sorry that I made this purchase!"
3,Ok - prefer Picture Bible,"I did check some things in this children's Bible against the Bible after reading some reviews that were not impressed with the accuracy.I normally purchase The Picture Bible by Iva Hoth and was looking for another one for the children. I did some comparisons for accuracy, and I'd have to say The Picture Bible was more accurate. So I plan to stay with that one for gifts.The Picture Bible is written in a comic book style. Our pastor had learned the Bible stories from this type when he was a child (He's in his late 70's now), and that is why he gives The Picture Bible away to our young children.If you are after more accuracy, look at The Picture Bible in comparison with this one.The Picture BibleIf you are after pictures, this one has nice ones."
5,this book is great. A great book this is :),I like pie so much. That is why you should get this book. ;) Yes?
2,Skip this author!,"I purchased this relatively unknown book due, in part, to the positive reviews. I was misled. As an avid reader, this book was underdeveloped and poorly written. The numerous typos are distracting and the characters lack depth. I forced myself to read the book, hoping it would improve but it did not. Save your money do not buy this book or anything by this author."
5,Outstanding Animal Fantasy,"I have read many animal fantasy books, and this is one of the best. The author has kept most of the natural traits of feral cats with a just a few magical elements added (multiple lives, magical stones, etc.). I like this series much more than the Guardians of Ga'Hoole. That series about owls is less believable because the owls have many human characteristics, such as reading, writing, and cooking."
4,Erin Hunter,"The Warriors series is one of my favorites because they are fast paced, well written and interesting. This book, Into the Wild, was given to me on my last birthday; ever since, I have finished the rest of this series and am hoping to buy the final books to the New Prophecy series very soon."
5,Good book,"Very good book.Started me on the series.All I had to do was read the first book, and I was hooked."
5,Nice book,I really loved this book and i think im going to like the series. I hope book two is good!
5,cirque du freak,I have been looking for this series for a few years! Now I finally have them!!!! I recommend this series to everyone who loves to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Boring,"Half-vampire Darren Shan, Mr. Crepsley and three of Mr. Tiny's Little People leave the Cirque Du Freak. They journey to the Vampire Mountain. Gavner Paul, a friend Mr. Crepsley also travels with them. One of the little people reveals his real name as, Harkat Mulds, and he has a message to deliver from Mr. Tiny to the Vampire Princes.Many dangers confront them on their way. The purple-skinned Vampaneze are close by.The Vampire Mountain is a network of tunnels and caves where the vampires live. Darren makes friends with several of the other vampires.The Princes and Generals weren't impressed with Darren. They thought he was too young. Now Darren must prove himself to them.I found the fourth book in the series to be boring and not enough action."
4,Good gift for a gamer,"I purchased this gift for a family member. She playes lots of different types of video games. She has more than one of the Shin Megami Tensei games and enjoys them all. It is not as good as the Persona series, but still a worthwhile purchase."
5,A Double Take,"This book is highly engrossing, and while the themes are all very familiar, they force you to do a ""double take."" You realize after you reach its crumbling finale that every detail of the story is a fair and overlooked representation of the 80's. The sexual encounters are perhaps the most essential revelations of this frame of mind; whithout them, the story would be no more than British television drama. But it is the unabashed recount of sexual encounters which unmask the ethos of this decade, the ravenous search for power."
1,boring,"Did not care for this book. It was a struggle to get to the last 100 pages which read somewhat more interesting but was not worth it. Don't waste your time, you never care for the characters, nor did I want to get to know them."
1,Utter rubbish,Don't waste your money. Boring and needlessly graphic gay sex.Totally unsympathetic characters.
3,TMI,More than I ever wanted to know about the inner lives of shallow people and the details of casual homosexual sex. Didn't finish.
2,rather disappointing,"Read the book on a transatlantic flight and afterwards, but found it rather tedious. As a portrait of a chattering society, Proust did unmeasurably better and we don't need any more of that. As to the main character, Ripley (Highsmith) comes to my mind and he was a much more interesting character than Nick. And as a piece of political satire, it is also not very exciting or revealing. Whether it is a profound portrayal of gay life, I cannot judge. The book just did not engage me on any of these levels, and as a Booker winner it is quite disappointing."
4,Taboo filtered through Jane Austen,"I just took a bath in '80s homosexual glam swirled with new money, old titles and Margaret Thatcher. This is a great glittery novel that points itself at Henry James - but I found it a nice offspring of Austen. Frankly, not a lot happens here outside of dinners and parties (and dinner parties). Yet, I came to the final third with the feeling that I'd been part of the era. There are a couple of critical, yet thinly drawn, characters. And maybe there has been so much media surrounding this coked era that it now seems cliche. The first criticism is the author's problem, the second is not. And what a fine antidote this is to the sad collection of ""chick lit""-type gay novels (with their cartoon covers) that have stacked up in recent years."
2,Not Durable,"These folders were a good price, and I've ordered this same style of Avery folder previously from another seller for my place of work and liked them, but these were disappointing when I opened them up. The pictures on Amazon did not reveal their thinness and how flimsy they are; also, the inside pockets are not fully attached on all sides to the folder, which would allow papers to fall out when the folder is opened. The overall look of these black folders is fine, but handling it is another matter. My co-worker who uses these will have to be careful with them, since they're so thin they will crease easily. I will not buy these again for my office."
2,Disappointing,"Although there is useful information in this book, I was disappointed in it. For a book about boys, it reads entirely too much like a book about coping with a chomosome abnormality -- the abnormality being the Y chromosome. Her general thesis is that the Y chomosome causes boys to develop more slowly and to be more succeptible to many other problems. Her approach to the discussion is very biologically deterministic. I found the 1 chapter on little boys in RAISING CAIN much more useful to understanding what my 4-year-old son is going through than this whole book. She is a strong believer in holdling boys back a year from Kindergarten. If you are looking for arguments for keeping your son back, this book may be what you are looking for. The publisher claims that this is the only book of its type, focusing on the parenting of young boys. That appears to be the case, which is a shame."
3,A good comedian,"I discovered Craig Shoemaker by listening to XM Comedy. I loved his Lovemaster skits that I heard, along with his interaction with the audience when he gets others to do their ""machine gun"" sounds when they played war as a child. Alas, this CD is apparently one of the very first ones that he did (around 1994), so the amount of ""Lovemaster"" is limited, and there is none of the ""war"" skit. That not withstanding, Craig is still funny, but if you are going to purchase a Craig Shoemaker CD, buy the one he released in 2007. I would give his '07 CD 5 stars."
5,My Favorite Book,"It's easy to hate people who have a different political view, but this book helps you understand them instead."
4,"Good Mystery, Not Just Golf","I read this whole series essentially back to back. I've read some of the Gideon Oliver books and enjoyed them but wasn't wowed. Read FRINGE and the others for the mysteries and not so much for the golf. (Hey, I can hack my way around a course but . . .) Recommended for anyone who likes a good mystery and a strong female protagonist."
4,"Not a ""Climbing"" block","It doesn't matter how high your front wheel is, it will not simulate an actual hill climb because you are not working against gravity. It can only simulate your *position* on the bike when climbing a hill. If you want to simulate the important part of a climb, i.e. having to work harder to gain elevation, crank up the resistance on your trainer."
4,Great Products,"This is a pretty benign product, however it is a necessary complement to the cycle ops pro. Difficult to imagine how trainer would work without climbing block."
3,Block,"Can't fault the product...just don't need it. The CycleOps trainer I bought is very stable so there is no problem with having to hold the front tire. If I hadn't bought the (too expensive but well-made) CycleOps mat then it would be a good way to save my carpet from wear. I am using a comfort bike with the trainer so it has wide tires that don't set very deep into the block. The result is that the bike runs ""uphill"". Without the block, the bike runs a bit ""downhill"". Either way it's no big deal. The block is well made (how can you mess up molded plastic these days?) and could be useful to level your bike. I would set up the trainer first and buy the block if you're not happy with some other method of leveling...or no leveling at all."
4,CycleOps Training Block,"Great product. I little ""chunck-ier"" than I was imagining, but it works great. Much better than using a phonebook!"
2,Fine at first...,"After installing drive and software with ease, I sucessfully burned 2 audio cds and 3 data cds. Now for some reason it only works for data (pictures). Every time I try to burn a list of songs it errors out after a couple of songs resulting in many thrown out cds. I am definitely returning this one."
3,deserves a 3.5,"Mest manages to put out another good pop-punk cd, but they sound all too much like the other John Feldman produced band, showoff (they're great). There are some good songs like yesterday and its over, but they seem to copy alot of other bands in their songs, too. the opening track sounds like it could have come straight off the new blink album, and cadillac ... almost as much as whats the dillio (come on, turntables?!?!?!) and the secret track sounds exactly like showoff. if you want a good mest, then get wasting time, which is faster and closer to punk than to pop"
4,I love this CD,"I love Mest....I've seen them in concert, and they're awesome. Tony is great. This is the 3rd CD and I think it's pretty kickass. Sure, some of the songs aren't so lyrically great, but it's fun to listen to. The songs that stand out are ""Drawing Board"" (who doesn't like this song?) ""Cadillac"" (for you people with some ghetto in you) and ""Yesterday"" (vocals by Jeremiah, sounds awesome).Some of the weirder songs are ""Reason"" and the hidden track. They're both cool, just...too jamacian. Oh well, I still listen to them.If you want a nice variety in music and fun music to listen to whenever, get this CD.Whether they're punk, pop-punk, or pop-rock, they're good."
5,This album rox!,This album rocks because the music sound cool. you can really get into the songs cause it has some fast beats that you just was to get up and go wild. I recommend this albums to people who like good punk rock music with a bit of hip hop. They have a beat like no other band that i know and they sound awsome. If you get this album you wont regret it.
5,Destination? Punk!,"MEST's Destination Unknown is an album you can put in your cd player and let it go for 2 staight hours and love every song. You can tell that these guys are in the buisness to have fun and play how they want to play. It may seem like trendy punk to some but their just sayin it to sound like they are all about the underground. MEST is an awesome band, their lyrics mixed with cool guitar rythms makes this one of my favorite cd's in about 3 years. This album is awesome."
5,Destination Unknown Review,"Let me start off by saying...if you didn't like Mest after ""Wasting Time"", I KINDA see where you're coming from. Maybe you thought they could only put out one good album (though it is very good). But after Destination Unknown, I see no reason why you can't like them. This cd is even better than Wasting Time, with some amazing tracks such as Opinions, Cadillac, Living Dead......hell the whole album is amazing. The lyrics are very good, and Tony Lovato is an amazing vocalist, but this album features something alot of other albums just totally ignore: the backup vocals. They, like everything else, are done very well on the cd. If your a living, breathing person, then go buy ""Destination Unknown""."
2,Insinkerator H-990W-SS,Installed this unit a little over 3 yrs ago and now find it leaking as so many others have experienced. Upon dis-assembly of the tank (which is SS) one finds that they use plastic sleeve inserts for the water lines and the drain plug. On my unit the water is seeping out at the drain plug between the plastic sleeve and the tank. The sleeve is glued into the tank so no real way to repair without busting out the plastic. This design concept is a real weak link in the product. A well engineered design would have the fittings brazed or welded into the tank itself.Not impressed at all with the durability of this product so really would not recommend to anyone unless you just want to spend money and more money.
1,Buy One to Install--But a Second as Backup,"We installed the first InSinkErator H990C Hot Water Dispenser in 1999. We have replaced it twice. Both times the tank began leaking and flooded the space under the sink. We enjoy the convenience the product offers, but just wish the design of the tank was more reliable."
5,"read it, u don't feel regret...","I have read most of Ms.Christie's books in my native language and after learning English I want to read some of them in English.This one is my first choice and I could recommend everyone.. The mistery in this book is different from her other books, unpredictable as usual,more psychological factors and strong characters in it.2 main plot which I like most , one of them Poirot overhear some conversation from an open window and the other is their mother's unsuitable reply to young pyichologist on the hotel entrance..."
2,Movie Lover,"The movie was satisfactory as far as the plot. The DVD was terrible in the transfer. I've had this movie about six months and have attempted to watch it many times, but never got past the first 15 minutes due to the poor quality of sound and picture. I finally watched it completely and only give it 2 stars for the basic plot which was only satisfactory."
5,fun-fun-fun,"We got these for the kids but we all love to play with them. They are interesting and easy to play with. I play with them while watching TV, after the kids have gone to bed. I wish they were more available cuse more is better."
5,"Painful on the Surface, but Needed and Well Done","Taxes? Ouch! It's rather like going to the dentist. A necessary evil. Most of us small business owners love the profits, but cringe at the taxes. Uncle Sam can be intimidating and a book like this can help overcome the fears, while explaining the options. It answers most of the FAQ's we face and does so in a thorough and easy to understand manner. I will probably refer to it many times as various tax issues arise."
4,"Great book, but not for beginners",There are several questionable things in this overall good book that would make me weary of recommending it to newcomers.4 Stars!
3,Good introduction into Eastern Monastisim,"Some parts of the book are great, sometimes the questions and answers between the writer and his spiritual direcor make you want to pull your hair out. An informative and interesting read, but it wont be a ""keeper"""
3,toddlers love it,Purchased this video for my granddaughter at about 18 months because she watches SESAME STREET frequently and loves to sing along with the characters. She loves it and has learned all of the songs on the video. Would think that most toddlers would enjoy this.
4,Mom Hates It; Son Enjoys It,"We bought this DVD because our hard to please 2 year old absolutely loves the first one, Kid's Favorite Songs.Kid's Favorite Songs 2 consists of Elmo running around Sesame Street asking questions & recording kids talking about their favorite songs. Unlike the first, this DVD has a lot of cut scenes where children are talking about & singing parts of their favorite songs with no muppets in sight. The show then cuts into scenes where muppets sing the entire song the children were talking about. There is also a lot of cut scenes where strange cartoons are singing the songs instead of muppets.I enjoyed watching Kid's Favorite Songs with my son, but Kid's Favorite Songs 2? Not so much. If it were up to me entirely, I would rate this rather low, but my son seems to enjoy it for the most part & adores the parts where Elmo is present, & that's what's important."
3,Too few appearances of Sesame Street Characters,"I bought this DVD for my 11-month old daughter because it includes most of her favorite songs and she seems to enjoy colorful puppets. However, I wish I had read all the comments more carefully before buying it, especially the low-rated stars. The picture on the DVD cover is misleading as it suggests that the content of the DVD will be about puppets singing songs. In reality, the great majority of the songs come with a cartoon background (except for Mary had a little lamb, Ernie Rubber Ducky, and Elmo Itsy Bisty Spider songs). I was also disapointed by the kids interviews from the ""Alley"" (actually recorded in a pink and blue studio with no puppets) because they make too long of intervals between the songs for my daughter short attention span. As content, it is about 50% cartoons, 20% of Elmo or other puppets and 30% of kids singing bits of songs (as regular kids do). I would recommend the CD instead for the good selection and lively songs."
3,Its Elmo - but it's just OK.,"It has Elmo in it, which is what my 11-month-old loves. But there is way too much talking and too many clips of ""live"" people. My son is glued to lots of Sesame Street and Elmo videos even at his young age - but he tends to lose interest in this one quickly."
3,Its ok,"There's just a lot of kids singing little songs and not very many puppets, I was kinda surprised and disappointed. Its definitely not one of the cuter videos but my 20 month old still likes to watch the little kids. There are better Elmo videos out there though."
5,A Great Business Novel,"""The Rise of David Levinsky"" is a great business novel. Cahan describes how Mr. L becomes a successful maker of men's coats, and how L's ex-partner's wife become a very successful real estate entrepreneur. Actual description of how business success has been achieved is rarely shown in novels: it's available here."
5,A major early work of American - Jewish Literature,"There is an irony in the title. Cahan has a hero rise in wealth and position in the society only to be empty inside. There is a price to his Americanization in the loss in some deep sense of his past source of meaning in life.This is a pioneering tale of American- Jewish Literature. It gives a picture of a world no longer with us.It is clearly and well - written, and if it is not in the category of great Literature, still it is a valuable social document. It is well worth reading especially for those interested in ' immigrant literature'."
1,Unreadable,"See my review for ""The Age of Innocence"" - it completely describes how I feel about this book and how unreadable it is."
2,Needs interpretation from English to English,"I can't be sure that my rating reflects the author's work more than it does the publisher's and editor's.Notwithstanding, there's quite a bit of brilliance in the writing style and the techniques the author employs to tell the story. Only what story he is telling, I cannot say. For the entire book I couldn't grasp the flow or meaning of the story. Of course I could read for pages and understand the mood and the speaker. But I have no clue what the book is about.And one wonders how it achieved ""Classic"" status."
2,The Kindle Edition is Poor,"While free, the Kindle edition is very poor. Poor or non-existent headings combine with frequent appearances of ""?"" in place of various letters to make this a frustrating read. Fortunately, I read the Modern Library edition years ago and was able to muddle through. Definitely not recommended for first time readers."
1,"Ulysses, Overated Book","It only decries Joyce's Ulysses to know it is so overated as it is. The book is not so good, it is boring, it is a colection of words and a continuous experimentation of styles that, unhappily, do not mean anything to the meaning of the story; that is, the book's language is snobbish and useless. Those who say that ""love"" such a writing are to be thought about as non-readers or as victims of a literary abnormality."
1,"Warning "" look inside book"" option is out of date","Ulysses (Everyman's Library, 100)When I ordered this book,(oct 08) the ""look inside book"" option showed the copy with blue covers, title on cover. But I received one with red covers, title on spine,the dust jackets are identical. Other reviews praise the blue covered volume, now out of date. If this matters to you, now you know you will receive the red covered volume.With my return, amazon may update the ""look inside"" book to show current red covers so you get what you ordered."
4,Impressive,I feel myself quite inadequate to write even a small review on such a masterpiece. This is a book of astonishing beauty and remarkable insight. I do believe it well worth the time and effort. The last few lines are truly the most extraordinay I have ever read.
1,This book is unintelligable.,"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great. It reminds me of modern art, where a so called artist splashes paint on a canvas in ten minutes and then passes it off as a masterpiece. It probably took Joyce less time to write this novel than it took me to read it. If my grade hadn't depended on it, I would have put it down after ten minutes."
1,"Ulysses [Annotated], in fact, not annotated","I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."
1,Missing text,"Every time there's a verb of speaking and a colon, this kindle ebook simply omits what follows. Somebody must've been in a big hurry."
2,Where are the annotations?,"Hello All,I selected this partially based on the statement that this edition was annotated and had images. I am reading this on my Android based tablet and I can find no annotations or images of any kind. Am I missing something or was the description of the edition in error?"
1,Good book; bad edition,"This edition is missing full sentences and won't make sense. If you've never read the book before, you'll be very confused."
1,Not recommended on iPhone,Its a classic literature. Just try not to read this on an iPhone. You'll get bored pretty soon and this book won't get the attention that it truly deserves.
1,a gimmick and then some,"Thi' got to be the worst, I- I - I mean the worst ever written book ever. Know why? 'Cause he' such a showoff, know what I MEAN? He's ingenious I'll giv' 'em that, but ingenuity my friends tire and enervate. Get to the point and stick to it 's my motto. The best part of the book is without a question the scene with Bloom, Gerty McDowell and company, but once you've figured it out you've figured it out."
2,"Adequate for portability, but not as the main text","I have read Ulysses a number times and purchased this edition for portability. While the product description indicates the edition is based on the 1984 Gabler edition, the Kindle edition includes a number of errors not present in that text. The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors. Also, in many cases numbers are rendered as letters and visa versa, particularly in the final episode. As Joyce often did not use conventional punctuation, it will be difficult for you to identify them unless you have previously read the book.If you are reading Ulysses for the first time or for school or study, you should avoid this edition. Its low price makes this edition is useful for casual re-reading."
1,Very disappointing!,"Very disappointed with this Kindle edition! No announced annotations, no comments, no links or images ... For a book like Ulysses totally unacceptable ... Is it a cheat? Want my small money back! (For info: I am using an original Kindle e-book reader, so should not be a matter of formatting or whatsoever)"
5,A Breakthrough Achievement,"From start to finish, Mr. Joyce dazzles the reader with the use of symbolism, dark humor, semantic puzzles, riddles, irony, grace, and magic. A shaman of the modern age, Joyce imbues his massive tome with word-remedies for the chronically sick and desperate--the very people who inhabit his 'dear dirty Dublin'. With Ulysees, Joyce marked himself as one of the major writers of his age...of any age!"
1,inappropriate cover picture,"Who published this? There are no characters in the entire book who would look anything like the characters on this cover! Most of the action takes place in a newspaper office, in a bed room, in a Martello tower, and at a funeral. Most people are dressed in jackets and ties, not torn shirts, and certainly no one smiles as dumb as these jokers. The looks of this book are a disgrace to the author."
3,I don't know why they all say it's so great...,"This book is not that good. I started reading it because it is at the top of all the book lists. But I mean, I'm not anti-great literature, but man! This book is DENSE. I don't see what is so deep about it. Dunno, just my humble opinion."
4,A genius Artist - Joyce,"A marvellous form of art with the help of english Words, perhaps. Several times i get lost between the pages, still continued to get something and i got a genius in the end. Wonderful ways of expressions of thoughts. You may feel that you are reading Bloom's mind. Every nervous processes happening in Bloom's mind will be yours. Joyce's innocence, honesty and his complete denial to change himself for the sake of all of us, made an impression deep inside me.Either you accept him as he is or leave him. That's upto you.He is not forcing anyone to accept him either.All through the pages I was delighted in his astounding mastery of words. Somewhere on the way, it made me smile too. Especially at the end of the book where he abandoned all the conventions of English Literature. Wonderful. Even now i don't have the words to define this book titled ""Ulysses"".But be prepared to have a tough time ahead when you start the book. Honestly, speaking i could not understand many of the pages."
3,Literary pyrotechnics add up to...?,"For me, the unfortunate limitations of this work, and the character of its creator, are summed up by the ""cork story""...someone visited Joyce at his home where there was a lithograph (?) of the city of Cork on the wall...the visitor realized the frame of the picture was indeed made of cork and commented on this....Joyce's reaction was in the vein of, what other possible frame could I have chosen?When a jigsaw puzzle is completely assembled, it is no longer all that interesting...I understand all the references, the entire book, I know what agenbite of inwit means, I have listened to tapes which give all the literary resonances, I've put the whole thing together...yes, it's a monumental achievement, but is this a book which is less profound than its own best exegesis?All that said, The one great thing I take away from this book is a love of Leopold Bloom's great humanity; however, I cannot justify the massive effort involved in doing so..."
1,Worth giving up my English degree,"Ulysses is the sorriest excuse for a novel I have ever come across; don't waste your time. I'm all for challenging reads, but not for gibberish which academics persist in labeling erudition. I find absolutely nothing redeeming about this book, but those who enjoy taxing their brains to ridiculous measures; drawing (more than likely inaccurate) conclusions from an incomprehensible conglomeration of words; and imposing meaning where none exists because few things in the text will limit whatever perspective they want to take are welcome to it."
4,Groundbreaking,"1950's observation of race relations, dating, and city life in general. Cassavetes already showed a rare gift for letting characters be more real life than standard movie heroes or villains. Each makes mistakes and each is capable of learning from them."
4,For the money an excellent choice.,"The cards are crappy but so what, good cards are cheap. The colors of the chips are muted compared to the picture posted, but again so what. Found them to have the same heavy weight feel of the real deal. For the money you can't go wrong. Bought these and played with a total of 6 players and the set size was perfect."
2,Cheap cheap cheap,"The chips do their job, but they don't exactly look high-quality. Somehow, despite arriving in sealed packages, the chips seemed to be dusty/dirty. The lining in the case that holds the chips is some kind of cheap fuzzy plastic. When mine arrived, one of the plastic slots for the poker chips was all crumpled up and the chips were just sitting in the space between the plastic and the wooden interior of the case. As for the cards, they somehow managed to find the absolute worst decks of cards that I've ever seen. I didn't think that they even made cards that bad. If you do buy this poker set, do yourself a favor and buy some real cards along with it."
1,Absolute Garbage..,"I got these in hopes of using them with a generic dice style set that I purchased about 5 years ago. These are no where near the quality of my others. Nearly every single chip has a flaw. The colors are dull. The white chips look like they have dirt in them and are yellowed. The stamped dice imprints are not aligned. Many of the chips have sharp edges and do not stack evenly, some have flattened sides. Some chips have a rough texture and the color is all splotchy. It looks like monkeys made these. The factory making these has absolutely no quality control. If you take poker even slightly seriously, avoid. I would not take these for free, let alone play with them."
4,Decent for the Price,"It is what it is, a chip-set. The case is made to look expensive but it in fact very flimsy, I've had to superglue it already. The chips are nice but the decks it came with are crap (not that it matters that much, you have to switch out decks pretty often if you're playing weekly poker). You can what you paid for (for $40-some dollars my expectations weren't THAT high). I really enjoy the black under cards (to stop from showing the bottom of the deck), those were a great addition that I never even thought of.Beyond that, I'd say these are good for the value, it's a great set to have at home if you don't have to move the case around too much."
4,Great Set of poker chips for the Price!,The poker chips are good quality. There are better chips out there but not for this price. The weight is good and I prefer having ones without denominations on the chips. The plastic has somewhat of a cheap feel and the cards are junk but overall the set is worth what you pay and you probably will last a good amount of time.
2,There are better flash cartooning books out there!,"In my opinion the only chapters worth reading are chapters 12, 13, 14 and 15. My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave. I prefer ""Flash 5 Cartooning"" and ""Flash Cartoon Animation: Learn From The Pros"" over this book."
5,This Generation Speaks to whom?,"To whom will this generation speak ten years from now? You (if in WW2) were a part of it and it is a part of you. The writing is excellent and material well presented but for some of us it brings painful reminders. How can 20, 30 year olds undertand? From the Rabbi: I took a handful of ashes (from the crematorium) and rubbed them so I would not forget. Would that everyone take a handful of ashes!"
2,Great performer - So-so teacher,"Chord soloing is playing chords over a melody. Doing this on a guitar faces some challenges: mostly, you play four string chords and you need to outline the chord and the melody on top of it. Piano players have it so easy. :)Most jazz tunes have frequent chord changes and alterations, so it's certainly tricky. What an interesting topic to try to teach, isn't it?Mr Carlini is a great jazz guitar player, but he's not an interesting teacher. Most of the songs are mostly show offs. He hurries over the necessary explanations and just refers to the booklet.He misses these points:# how do you play these songs?# what are chord options and why can you substitute to other chords?# how can you work through chord options to get the optimum playingMy advice to Mr Carlini is to cut down the number of songs to three or four and thoroughly walk through them.Unfortunately, there aren't tons of other instructional DVDs in this area, but hope you find something else."
2,Ideas from Tolkien,"I found and purchased this book because I was interested in writing a fantasy novel and wanted to see how other fantasy novelists wove their storylines. Maybe I'm being picky, but I found far too many parallels with this book to that of the Lord Of The Ring series by JRR Tolkien. In Tolkien, Bilbo and Frodo were the Ring-bearers; in this novel, the pig was the Key-bearer. And in Tolkien, Gandalf rode a fast horse known as Shadowfax; in this novel there was an almost identical character with a very similar name also. There were several other times while reading it that I found parallels too close to Tolkien to be merely coincidental. But enough about that. As a whole, the novel was very shallow and predictable. I didn't find it challenging in the least (as I did when I read the Tolkien fantasy novels...or others like Neverwhere). I gave it two stars for the simple fact that it was easy to follow and I was able to read it quickly. But it left me feeling empty."
3,"Corny, some funny moments, but overall blah","I must say this movie was a letdown when compared to some of it's counterparts, ""not another teen movie"" and the ""Scary Movie"" series. This must be from the guys that did scary movie 3, which not quite as good as 1 and 2 (which featured the waynes brothers as actors and writers). Breakthrough moments of laughter, but no real stand out moments of humor. At times, slow to develop, or just overdone wiht the spoofs, even predictable. So, I would say this may be a renter of a movie, but a good movie for some laughs."
1,Just plain awful.,"Date Movie is a disgusting and witless parody of romantic comedies that tries to be funny because it makes fun of movies such as MEET THE FOCKERS, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and such. But it turns out flat.STORY: Julia Jones's Diary is that of an overweight redhead that meets Hitch and goes over to ""Pimp My Date"" to be pretty again. She goes on Extreme Batchlor: Elimination Edition to meet Grant Fockyerdoder, a hopeless british romantic who chooses her. He Meets The Parents, who dissaprove of Grant. Then, on a trip to the Fockyerdoder isle, Julia and Grant go visit The Wedding Planner...and that's all I watched up to.THOUGHTS: Let's not mention it.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"
1,I can't get that part of my life back,"Like the previous one star post stated, you can't spoof comedy. I watched the first 30 min of this movie, and for that I am sorry. I apologoze to myself for wasting 30 mins of my life that I cannot get back. It's gone.From what I did see, was 30 min of continual parody's, so much so, that I really had no idea that there was actually a plot. And to see Fred Willard in this made me sad.Bottem line, don't waste your time."
2,"Funny, but too much bathroom humor","I saw this DVD at a friend's house a few weeks ago.While Alyson Hannigan was a great actress, the movie relied TOO MUCH on bathroom humor. I enjoyed the comedic scenes and the allusions to other movies, but the gross factor in several skits seemed excessive. In addition, while there was great humor, the movie seemed too much like its predeccesor, the ""Scary Movie"" series. If you truly want vomit-producing humor, get this. Otherwise, there are better comedies available."
1,"I HATE IT SO MUCH, NOT EVEN FUNNY",I hate this film so much I can't even explain it. The only funny thing about this film is how bad it is.
2,Hannigan Deserves So Much Better,"I'm giving this DVD an extra star only because of the presence of Alyson Hannigan, who is so effortlessly charismatic, funny, and lovely that she almost makes it worth sitting through. Otherwise, this is a movie that suffers from ""Family Guy"" disease; the writers think that a random reference to another movie or TV show is the same thing as a joke. So they have an actress re-enact the Paris Hilton hamburger commerical; or stick Hannigan in Uma Thurman's yellow ""Kill Bill"" track suit and give her a sword to wave around. And then they don't try to be clever or put a funny spin on these; they just hope the 13-year-old boys in the audience will recognize the reference and think that's enough. One hopes that better filmmakers will see Hannigan's star power and put her in funnier movies, so we can all just forget about this one."
1,One of the worst out there.,"Date Movie is from two of the six writers of Scary Movie, apparently they chose the two worst because the movie fails to generate laughter. A few chuckles here and there but that's all.Date Movie is a spoof of romantic comedies. Simply that idea sounds good right? The writers had alot to work with, but they failed miserably. Alyson Hannigan plays the main character, Julia Jones. Personally, not a big fan of her comedy. Now, Eddie Griffin, Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard can be quite hilarious but none of that is portrayed in this flop.This might be enjoyed by some, but only a few. For me, a big comedy fan, it was pretty bad in general.I actually watched it at the theaters and, my friends, it was the biggest waste of ten dollars in my life! It is now out on dvd and someone will have to pay me to watch it again...Ok maybe not pay me but at least pay for the movie.One measly star *"
2,This was a pretty bad movie,"Ok, the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place was because Alyson Hannigan is in it(I'm a big Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan). And well,it was pretty much what I expected it to be- a pointless stupid crude movie. I've seen 3 of the Scary Movies, and they aren't any better than date movie. So if you're a fan of Scary Movie, then you might enjoy this movie. Just take to mind that it is pointless stupid entertainment, and have fun wasting an hour and a half of your life."
1,stupid a$$ movie,"i bought this on sale for $5.99 a few months ago, i should've known it was going to be a waste of money since it was so cheap. i didn't even finish watching it. putting it in my pile to goodwill."
2,DATE MOVIE I THINK COULD HAVE DONE WAY BETTER!!!!!!,Date Movie with Alyson Hannigan was a ok movie i think that they could have made it funnier then what they say it was.... Julia James is a fat girl trying to find love and one day while working at her dad's family restaurant she meets the man of her dreams or what she says her prince.... She then does herself a complete makeover and falls in love with her man..... This movie was a cry for help and i think that they could have made it better!!!!!!
1,Robbed of 85 minutes of my life & I want my money back!,"Take heed! Don't rent/buy or even watch this movie for free! Instead, get yourself some bubbly toilet bowl cleaner and watch it bubble for 85 minute - you'll have a MUCH better time. Yes, parodies can be funny, (Think Airplane! or Scary Movie) but when a studio stoops to pump out watered down trash like this it just ends up turning off people from an entire genre. The length of this move shows 85 minutes. 5 for credits & another 5 for repeated flashbacks, (which serve no purpose than to take up space) and you are down to 75 of pure trash. Why oh why?"
3,Could have been so much better!,"I'm going to have to agree with most of the previous reviewers and say that this indeed is not the best of movies.Date Movie, following in the footsteps of so many films before it, is a parody of several movies including My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Hitch, Meet the Fockers, Meet the Parents, and many (too many) more.It is humorous... at times. The casting is all right, though most of the dialogues could have been a lot better. What it comes down to is that there seems to be a problem with... the humor (or lack of it).The major pro is Sophie Monk who is simply breathtaking (WOW)!In a nutshell, it's an ok movie if you're under 13 and/or are heavily intoxicated, and that's about it; no masterpiece here... Wait till they show it on TV. 2.5 stars"
3,fishy burp,i was prescribed these fish oil pills after my lasik. but i'm getting fishy burps after taking just one of these pills a day and the recommended dosage is 3 per day. i think there might be other brands which don't cause fishy burps.
3,a bit expensive,i bought these due to dry eyes after Lasik surgery. i decided i can use plain fish oil at a fraction of the cost and it produces the same effect.
3,Fishy Smell & Gas,"Because of chronic dry eye, I have to take one 3x per day. Since I started on these, I have had excess amounts of gas & certain body parts have a fishy odor. Anyone else have these isues? Any other alternatives?"
2,Bizarre side effect,"Although my Lasik procedure was a success, the experience left visibly red veins across the whites of my eyes which have not faded even after a year's time. Based on the other reviews here I began taking this supplement at the recommended dose of 3/day hoping that it would reduce the redness in my eyes. Prior to this I had been taking a single fish oil pill/day.While the redness of my eyes did appear visibly reduced over time, I began to experience a baffling side effect where, with my mouth wide open in mid-yawn, my jaw would suddenly and unpredictably ""lock"" open. I had to push and prod the side of my jaw for minutes at a time before things would pop back into realignment and I could close my mouth. For a couple of weeks I had no idea what was happening and was about to go see a doctor before I put two and two together. I immediately ceased taking the supplement and it hasn't happened since.Probably not a typical reaction bit I'll stick to regular (low dosage) fish oil for now."
3,"One classic, two duds","I picked this up when I was first building my DVD collection. I wanted a copy of SUDDENLY but this was the only DVD issue of it I could find at the time. Being somewhat of a Rat Pack fan, I thought I was getting a great three-for-one bargain. While SUDDENLY is a classic film noir (and one of Frank Sinatra's best films), the Sammy Davis western comedy and the Dean & Jerry films are dogs. I'm gonna replace it with one of the bargain priced reissues of SUDDENLY that are now available."
5,"Interesting stories, well told","If these stories of women who made a difference despite all odds don't inspire you to achieve to your fullest potential, it's doubtfull that anything else can. The spectrum of women chosen is a testament to diversity. This would make a great holiday gift for anyone and everyone."
4,Reassuring - Especially for Courageous Yet Criticized Women,"Do you feel isolated and judged at work, simply for being who you are? Then you may well be a Mustang Sally, insists journalist Fawn Germer (""Hard Won Wisdom""). Mustang Sallys (from the song) don't go along to get along, says Germer, which means great rewards, but also great trouble - especially in business, where women have little leeway as outspoken leaders.Peppered with interviews from some 75 different women like Hillary Rodham Clinton, Erin Brockovich and Eve Ensler (""The Vagina Monologues""), Germer offers advice on being true to yourself, fighting for what matters, getting what you want and daring to make mistakes. While Germer suggests little in the way of self-examination, she will definitely reassure courageous yet criticized women who refuse to kiss up in order to move up."
4,A review of the actual DVD...,"There's not much to say about the actual film. It's dated, and represents a time in society that has passed; something like this could not be done today. For this reason, it remains a curiosity. It's also not nearly as raunchy or explicit as it's reputation makes it to be. It does have frequent nudity, male and female, but it's not done salaciously - tasteful, if you will. It's almost done in an innocent way.Now for the DVD - for the first time (in the US, anyway), it is presented in it's original aspect ratio, 1.85:1, and is 16x9 enhanced. The picture quality is quite stunning. I could not tell if this was a matted presentation, or if it opens up from the (assumed) panned-and-scanned VHS full-frame version, but the framing looks good here. The only extra is it's original theatrical trailer."
2,What do you say to aNaked Lady,This movie was very poor quality and was not at all like my husband remembers it. I was disappointed also.
5,Very best lounge music,"Hi,You can buy this album yours eyes closed, but your ears open. Very good album."
5,Chincoteague Wild Pony Story,"Sea Star is a charming, beautiful story. It's the first Marguerite Henry book I have read. I might read all of her books about the Chincoteague ponies.The main thing is not to read an Amazon review because there are so many spoiler reviews why would anyone bother reading books? It's really a turn off.If you love horses & want your children to read good horse books Marguerite Henry tells a wonderful horse story. She uses dialogue that is specific to the region which might not work for children struggling with reading unless you read along with them."
5,Oldster loves these books,"Hey, I am 70 years old and grew up reading Misty and Sea Star. They are just as enchanting now. Only thing is the hardbacks are too expensive, and they have the super fabulous Patrick Dennis illustrations. I have bought them for my horse-loving granddaughter."
5,From one horse-lover to any others out there.,"I liked reading Sea Star by Marguerite Henry. It had wild horses with wild manes and flaring nostrils. Mares and foals of all types, pintos, bays, snow whites, and pitch black stallions galloped across the marshy plains. The book kept me on the edge of my seat and I was right there with Paul and Maureen, the two main characters when they found Sea Star. I was transported in my mind to the island of Chincoteague where I was flying across the sandy beach on my mounted steed next to them looking for the starving, tiny foal. Sea Star was my favorite book in the series of three books that I have read by this author."
3,"Not great, but still better than most studio fare","The Tailor of Panama is not a Boorman film on the same level as Deliverance, Point Blank or the more recent The General, but it is far superior to most studio fare. The film has much to recommend it even if LeCarre's labyrinthian plotting is played here for comic effect. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography brings the exotic seediness of Panama to vivid life. Brosnan and Rush play off each other brilliantly (there is a strange homoerotic frisson to their relationship). The smaller parts filled in by John Fortune and Harold Pinter add to the charm of this meta-spy story. Boorman is one of the old breed of 60s/70s directors, whose ambitions have been stifled by the sheer awfulness of American studio decision making of the last decade. It is nice to see him working even if one senses his wilder impulses are being held in check. The transfer is excellent and Boorman is as articulate as always on the commentary track."
2,A surprisingly bad movie.,"The movie starts slowly as you wait for pierce brosnan to be more a part of the movie. Then Brosnan is truly a dispictable character (unless you love sociopath sex addicts) with the only good guys being the revolutionaries and the tailor. There are plenty of vulgar language and dialog, plus some T and A, so this one is for 18 year olds and up, or no one at all.In true left-wing Hollywood style, the bad guys win, and there are untrue references to President George Bush, ""#41""."
4,Amusing and occasionally intelligent,"I truly enjoyed the movie for what it is: part spoof, part mystery spy flick. Acting is quite good, Panama cannot be possibly mistaken for the real place (mistake made by many one-star reviewers who actually know the country). Relax, enjoy the ride, and try to keep up with the twists of the plot."
3,"Decent, Low-Key Spy Story","This is extremely low-key tale of a British spy sent to Panama to see who is going to control the Panama Canal. The public didn't care for this movie because it was so slow-moving. Pierce Brosnan, Geoffrey Rush, Jamie Lee Curtis, Brendan Gleeson and Catherine McCormick are all actors I find interesting so I enjoyed watching them and this film, in general.My only objection was the normal bias, here making George Bush Sr., the British and the Americans look pushy and obnoxious in their dealings to control the locks.The story is a bit confusing in spots but interesting enough to stay with for the entire 109 minutes. There are a few sexy scenes thrown in to help keep your attention. I was surprised at the number of f-words in this ottherwise-classy movie."
3,"Outside the Prisoner, mostly","What the others have said. The Prisoner content is minimal, but what there is slightly furthered my understanding of the series and its origins.If you're interested what it was like to be a peripheral character in the film industry in London in the Swinging Sixties, this is worth a look."
5,"I wish I could sing like this man here, who is sensational.","Tony B. (Babino,not Bennet) Is one of the best singers around today (Tony Bennet is not bad either) But mr.Babino is more than deserving of carrying the torch, that was once held ever so high by one ""Francis Albert Sinatra"" I myself being an entertainer (who also sings) can really appriciate mr.Babinos brilliance with a song. His vocal ability is remarkable. I predict he will be going far in this business (show business,that is) everyone who likes good music should get his CD ""Swinging Around"" It is the best thing to happen to popular music in years. Man, he good Actor/Entertainer:Vic Martino"
4,An enjoyable evening of viewing,"This is Cary Grant being Cary Grant - urbane, amusing, and a comfortable figure in our home. Sophia Loren is a young, but not too young, woman - beautiful, bright and charming while establishing her adult independence. The movie is a delightful escape, not a classic that will live for centuries. But, a very pleasant, even delightful, and enjoyable way to spend an evening."
5,Houseboat,This is a classic. A must have for all classic movie lovers out there. I bought this movie for my brother who one of his passion is to collect all oldies. He has seen them all and already have a lot in his collection.
4,Houseboat,"Houseboat is a highly entertaining Romantic Comedy featuring two superbly talented actors at the height of their careers: Cary Grant, and the incredible Sophia Loren.Sophia's performance is perfect-what a woman!"
2,Save your money!,"This is first time I have been compelled to write a bad review, but frankly, this movie was bad. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing I love more than a romantic comedy. However, this was not romantic and not funny. I didn't expect an Academy Award winning movie, just a cute, entertaining, romantic comedy. It didn't deliver. The two stars have been great in everything I have seen them in, but this movie just did not work for them. I felt no chemistry between them, Chris O'Donnell just irritated me the entire movie, and the lines these actors were expected to deliver were horrible. I was embarrased watching this movie. I've read the previous reviews and I must say I'm interested in seeing the original so I can see what they could have done with this movie. Skip this one and see ""Return to Me"" when it comes out on DVD/Video."
4,Stereotypical... but lots of fun!,"The Bachelor is a hilarious movie about a man that is afraid of committment, but has already found the woman of his dreams. It's how extreme circumstances, make him discover what he wanted a bit earlier than he was ready to. It's lots of fun, and the ending is extremely hilarious!! It is, however, a bit stereotypical in all the men in the film stress how marriage is the inevitable ball and chain... and all the women in the film, are ready for the committment, which is such a joke. However, the film is hilarious and all the crazy escapades that occur just had to the hilarity of it all. Highly recommended!"
3,"COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUT OVERALL FUN MOVIE","Forget the critics who slam this movie just because it doesn't measure up to ""Gone With The Wind"" or something like that. See ""The Bachelor"" for yourself with a relaxed attitude and an open mind and you'll have some fun, I guarantee it. I admit, things are exxagerated a bit, but that's exactly what makes this movie so funny. Imagine yourself proposing to all of your ex-partners to see if one will marry you within 24 hours in order to inherit 100 million bucks! Again, I'm not going to sit here and say that it was the greatest movie ever, but I definitely had some fun watching it. Worth a rental or two."
2,This one should have a warning label...yikes!,"So, I saw the ad for this one and thought, Chris O'Denell as a loveable Bachelor, looks like fun...but was I ever in for a let down. THis movie is just awful. And on a side note, the depiction of 30-something women as gold-digging, husband-hungry, cometitive maniacs is rather bizzare."
1,NOTHING ORIGINAL,"This is just an extended version of The Three Stooges short ""Brideless Groom"" in which Shemp stood to inherit $500,000.00 if he got married within 7 hours. A clear indication that Hollywood has long past run out of ideas."
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie to be silly and at times irritating. It did have a few (very few) touching moments, and 1 or 2 chuckles but this is NOT a keeper. The film is blatant in its use of stereotypes (desperate women/weak men). It was hard to be sympathetic with Chris O'Donnell's character, when he was willing to throw away the ""love of his life"" for 100Million $, oh, wait, he was making the sacrifice for his employees. And why was everyone (especially the lawyer) so surprised by the amount of money in the estate?"
1,Quality problems!,"I really liked the size and design of this TV; I sometimes used it in my study while on the computer (which means light use, not my main TV). The tuner failed after a few months and Toshiba helped pay for it to get fixed (yes, I liked it enough to fix it once even if it is an inexpensive TV). Well, the tuner failed again 15 months after the original purchase date. This time it's off to Mount Trashmore and Toshiba won't be on my list of replacements."
2,stereo types and poor quality,"To be blunt, I didn't go beyond the first 15 min. The quality was crap and the story too predictable. Basically, it was, Analyse this! but a good guy who was loosing his biscuits instead of a mobster. woot. no, not really. I am a huge fan of Liam Neeson... this was more of a disapointment than Star wars Ep one.. you know, where he died?"
2,Boring,"LOVE Liam Neeson, but this was not his best film by any stretch. Three of us watched it and all wondered what the heck was going on. Would not recommend."
2,Hard to follow,My husband and I watched this over the weekend. We were both very lost for about the first 25 minutes. Finally we watched the trailer to see if it was worth watching the rest of it. Watching the trailer helped - but not completely.This is by far - NOT our favorite movie of all time.
4,Under rated,"I absolutely love how this film is really about stereotypes, and how everyone in it is the opposite of their stereotypes. An undercover DEA agent that has lost his nerve and really doesn't want to be an agent any longer. A nurse that is anti-medical eatablishment, and just want's to play in the dirt. A mob thug that just wants to grow some tomatos (that may be a little stereotypical.) And some Colombian drug dealers that really just want to run away together."
3,"Funny movie, and not a bad little thriller, either.","Big belly laughs, subtle humor, and nicely written character moments comfortably co-exist in this crime comedy that isn't a half-bad little thriller, either. I liked the way no one is immediately as they seem, and that each major character is often viewed very differently by the other characters. Oliver Platt's gangster character, for example, is rightfully seen as a brutal thug by mostly everyone, but is not given the time of day by his overbearing wife, who makes him do all the housework. I also enjoyed that both the big and small laughs are all character driven, and felt that the film was only slighly marred by an over-the-top rescue scene near the end involving Liam Neeson's therapy group arriving like the cavalry. Overall, ""Gun Shy"" is funny, involving, and, as a bonus, beautifully photographed in warm tones that make one want to visit New York City right away!"
2,Ambiguous,"This book has the potential to make a strong case about the moral dilemma of American society, however, it is very poorly written. The argument is very unclear, and at times, it seems like the authors are merely presenting the facts instead of making a case. It has some good points and a good objective, but it this objective is poorly supported."
5,Great Stuff,Goes on smooth lasts and absorbs what more can you ask for? Gives a superior slide and pleasant glide. Thanks
4,GOOD BUT OILY,"THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR ITS PURPOSE BUT IT WILL STAIN AND IT WILL RUIN YOUR SHEETS. ALSO, IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. YOUR SKIN WILL BREAK OUT."
5,"So emotional, so real!","This movie is brilliant in being so close to the real play in all detail, that I truly admire the devotion of its creators, who worked toward filming Shakespeare, rather than using his name to present their personal impulses. A true European film, and the music is an unforgettable masterpiece."
5,My all-time favourite: unmatched for its beauty,"This movie speaks for itself. It is absolutely timeless for the breathtaking beauty and wide-eyed innocence of Olivia Hussey as Juliet, the lush cinematography, the moving and haunting musical score from Nina Rota, the costumes and fine casting - all combine to create an indelible movie experience. You feel that you are being transported back to the 16th century, and consumed by the inchoate passion and, ultimately, the tragedy of these two 'star-crossed' lovers. This film seens to invade all your senses, and is so all-encompassing that it transcends description."
2,Romeo & Juliet,The only reason I watched this movie is because it was a required see from a class in college I was enrolled in.
5,As it should be,"Good movie, cheap price, no problems. I got it very quickly through the holidays. I would recommend this mivie an company to anyone."
3,Great when it stays together,"My son was thrilled to get this for his 10th birthday. He is very athletic and loves both football, and baseball. It's a little inconvenient in that you have to take it down and flip it around and clip it back together to switch from the football side to the baseball side. The worst part is that we left it outside and when it was windy, all of the clips that held it together broke off and it only came with one extra. Needless to say, my son won't be able to use it until we rig something up to make it stay together."
4,A Spoof For The Ages,This film sets out to spoof Airplane disaster films and does a hilarious job. The original is still the best but this one has plenty to offer the spoof-fan. Many of the original cast members return in this one along with many new faces. What else can be said but to give it a try!?
2,But They're Not On an Airplane!,"I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS."
2,Missing so many scenes!!,"Okay, we all know this isn't the best sequel out there but it has its moments. However I find it SHAMEFUL that this version is missing many scenes that are shown on TV. (Simon in escape pod, Sonny Bono's reason for being on the flight, The Sarge explaining potential bomb damage, Striker reading 'Modern Electronics', the list goes on!) Why leave out scenes on a DVD is beyond me."
4,Airplane! - The Next Generation.,"Another in a long line of hilarious spoofs done by the ""Zucker Brothers"" and their partner Abrams - This ""ZAZ"" (Zucker-Abrams-Zucker) film joins the ranks of it's bretheren like Top Secret! Airplane! and the Naked Gun series as a heck of a good time. From the opening credits done in scrolling ""Star Wars"" style set to the original Battlestar Galactica theme all the way to the William Shatner over-the-top ending, Airplane II: The sequel is a great way to pass some idle time away!"
1,"""Say It Isn't So, Joe?""","Two words: not funny.While the task was daunting -- if not impossible, the studio tried to follow-up the incredible success of AIRPLANE! ... but, instead, they ran out of air after the opening credits. Largely unfunny, the same cast from AIRPLANE! is brought back together to face the monumental task of delivering the same jokes. Don't waste your time, your money, or any brain cells on this horrible stinker."
5,comprehensive,"i find it extremely useful. whenever i looked a term up, i always found it. its easy enough to understand having only a minimum of statistical background, but it is also informative enough to be useful. :) its a winning combination."
2,Nothing new or compelling to be found here...,"Conspiracy of One offers a view of the JFK assassination without givng much information. While Mr. Moore shares his hypothesis in relation to the result of each shot fired in Dealy Plaze his major emphasis seemed to be in discrediting other writers and researchers who have put forth alternative scenarios. This, I found, was far too self-serving and moralistic.If you are looking at this book as a research tool it falls short. Footnotes are sparse; lacking in detail, and there is no attempt to cite source material. As a scholarly piece of writing, Conspiracy of One does not make the grade.While I give Mr. Moore credit for the discipline to write such a piece, his theory surrounding the JFK assassination would be much better suited to another medium such as a radio talk show program."
1,I never received it. It's been ordered about a month ago.,"Please, let me know if I should continue to wait for the book, or just order it else where. Thank you."
2,Not real happy,"The book arrived on time and for that I have no problem, the shipping service worked great. My unhappyness results from the book not being complete. During a recent classroom session we were directed to turn to the appendix, imagine my dismay when the appendix was not in the book. A further review of the book revealed several of the photos were not present and in place of the photo ""FPO"" in place of the graphics."
5,Proof-Positive,"I gave this movie only 5 stars because there is no 6-star rating. It is proof-positive that a very good movie can be made without shocking one's sensibilities. The only problem I noted on this DVD was there was no audio on either of the otherwise apparently interesting extra features (the cast at the Truman White House, and newsreels of Taylor's first wedding). This appears to be a common problem, as others have experienced it with their copies. I bought another for a gift, and it is missing the audio on the specials also."
3,dated but good,this movie was recently pickicekd as one of the funniest movies of all tim i think its more cute than funny but its pretty good. i tthink its funny to see how chep thing s were back then if stanley was around today and saw the prices for a wedding he would freak.
1,This movie doesn't even deserve a star...,"OK, I knew it would be bad. But, I love yoga and have heard a lot about Madonna's ability as a yogini. I sat through this entire agonizing movie to see one 45 second second scene of her doing yoga. {SIGH} Don't bother."
5,One of the BEST Movies Ever made!,"I just want to say i really enjoyed THE NEXT BEST THING. Many of the other reviews focus on MADONNA's accents, her hair, the lighting anything but the movie. I think she is an AMAZING actress. When she is in music videos shes acting so when someone puts a Film crew in front of you whats the differece there both performances. I just think this is a Great movie that touches your heart. I am sorry so many people focus on MADONNA and think she is a bad actress as if they know who she is in real life. Anyway ignore all those reviews that focus on everything but the actual film and there prejudice toward MADONNA. Check THE NEXT BEST THING out its a GREAT flick and MADONNA does a good job, come on she is MADONNA she can do what she wants!"
1,Bad,The video kept timing out. The screen would go black or multi color. I had to wait for the movie to restart every 10 minutes
2,It's not as bad as I thought,"I saw this film after hearing enough of bad reputation of the film. Madonna does well in musicals because she can sing and dance, but acting is not something she is good at.The story itself was not too bad. It was just that good acting was missing in the movie. I don't know why a smart hard working person like Madonna did so poorly in the film. With the interesting story they could have done better. It's too bad that it turned out like that."
1,Madonna as a Yoga Instructor Sporting a British Accent = BAD,"Now you'd think that by putting director John Schlesinger and Rupert Everett together something interesting would transpire--that is until you realize that Madonna's been added to the mix and therefore completely sinks an already vapid storyline even further. Unfortunately, it's not so bad that it's good (like ""Showgirls"")--it's just bad. Avoid this boring homophobic mess at all costs."
5,sahm i am,"I loved this book because i like to read emails and this book is made strictly with emails. you feel like your reading other peoples emails and thats kinda fun.It was a fast read, i read it in 2 days.We need more of these books. Meg cabot also does the email books, they are great!!"
2,Kids Not Interested and VERY Annoying,"I had high hopes when I bought this because my twins were just getting into toys that made sounds and they were really actively playing with similar toys. Unfortunately, they could care less about this one and it just sits on the floor.The upside is that I would go crazy if they did like it because the sounds are very annoying. The best way to descrive the sounds would be to imagine a slot machine at a casino...fine when you are in Vegas but not the nursery. Also, this thing eats batteries fast.Every child is different and you may find this to be a great toy, but I do not recommend it based on my experience."
4,GOOD START FOR THIS TOPIC,"Excellent book, well written, to the heart of the problem, you can see that is written by somebody who has studied the Bible and other sacred text of the 3 most important world religions.I didn't like the way was edited though. In any case a good introduction of a good first book for somebody who dare to venture in such complicated topic."
3,why just Atari....Intellivision rocked,"This set would been much better and complete if they included Intellivision titles. Activision made a few version for Intellivision and were far superior and very enjoyable. They made Pitfall, River Raid and a few others. Plus Activision who owns Imagic...well Imagic's Intellivision games were asweome! Atlantis, Micro surgoen, Demon Attack, Beauty and the Beast, SafeCracker, ect ect. If you ever played the Imagic's games on Intellivion, you'd never play the crummy 2600 games. They certainly had the space to throw the extra games in, just a shame they didnt."
5,Great Movie!!!!,I love this movie!!!! Why can't they sell a truly great Christmas Movie?????? Fred Savage and Hume were great together. Please release this movie on DVD!!!! Thanks Jean a Christmas movie junkie
3,OKay,The book was okay. It had a lot of good pictures but it was predictable. It was cute but not a big surprise ending but I still liked it.
4,Silver Mistress,This book was in excellent condition. Although I adore Madeline Brent stories (by the same author under a pen name) I did not really enjoy his Modesty series. I finished the book and it was okay.
4,Gypsy and Nimblefoot stands the test of time,"I had read this book in the early 1980s and picked it up again recently realizing it was the 2nd book in a series. Within the first few pages of the first chapter I remembered the general premise of the first book and the plot of this book as well. Rereading Gypsy and Nimblefoot was a charming visit with an old friend.This is essentially a story about trust - the horse Nimblefoot and the protagonist Wendy must both learn to trust again after traumatic accidents.The story, characters, and themes stand the test of time."
3,Ok CD with some essential tracks,"I searched years for this release. The compilation makes me feel as though someone produced this CD to too fast and fell of track alone the way. The title ""Nina's Back"" was a great concept. The picture of the bare back of Nina was bold for the time. I loved the story telling that lead up to ""Porgy"" as well as this rendition. ""Touching and Caring"" was the reason I looked for this CD. This song alone told people that Nina was back."
1,Disappointed,"Had the artists of this CD been listed on the website, I would not have bought it. To be honest, out of the 20 songs on the CD, I only purchased it for ""Just an Illusion"" by Imagination and what I thought was ""Young Hearts Run Free"" by Candi Staten. I've been looking for the two everywhere...Oh it has the song but it's not by Candi! It's by someone I've never heard of....I'm very disappointed....then I decided to give it a try...IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!"
5,Classic Documentary on South Africa,"This is a well-known classic music documentary on South Africa. A point of reference as a report and as one of the first explorations of this rich scene. It is mentioned on the 'Graceland' album cover notes as the place where Paul Simon first saw Ladysmith! Beautifully produced, edited and shot. Pleasurable!"
3,Not really under success wraps,"Well comparing with the first movie, this was a disappointment. Production wise. I enjoyed the story, although it was pretty much predictable towards the end. Sorry to say, but aside from that I guess it was entertaining. The movie failed in production because of a downgrade in quality. Especially with that scorpion king supernatural mutant at the end...WHAT WAS THAT!!! I was so excited to see really state of the art CG productions and during the climax - the movie fails to follow. Big let down! But in fairness to the makers of this surprise flick. I love the series and I think it earns a spot on having a third installment, if that's still a possibility. But it would be best to maintain the quality it showed during the first movie. Hoping for a better one."
3,"Not even close to the first, but still fun.","This movie had possibilities. It started out pretty good, but somewhere along the way it got lost in itself. It's not the story, and by that I mean the plot. It's the direction and by that I mean the flow and ridiculousness of it all. The movie suffers big time at the end. It was trying to be more than it was. It was trying to be epic, after more than an hour of silliness (including jet-engined hot air balloons and pigmy living dead).Still if you can get past all that it does have some of the charm of the first movie and you do find yourself rooting for the heroes to win, and laughing a little along the way (mostly at things that were supposed to be funny).If you liked the first you may or may not like this one. I found myself nearly hating it in the theater, but enjoying it more the second go around at a friends house, enough so that I bought it to watch it a third time and even a forth."
5,...It was good.,Great film. Not as good as The Mummy but still good. Buy DVD after you buy Mummy. Then buy this then Scorpion King. The Rcok is great actor but better wrestler.
5,Kudos to the Army of Annubis,"All the effects and vistas look absolutely vivid and stunning. I was really impressed with how the film appeared in this format. I've owned this movie in regular DVD and the difference is like night and day. Every grain of sand as well as all the detail present in the Scorpion King, the wall of water, and of course the Army of Annubis were all realistic (looking)...and who could argue seeing Rachel Weisz in Hi-Def ? Although both ""Mummy"" films look the best they ever have, the second one wins the unofficial clarity contest. Oh yeah, the sound ROCKS !!"
4,Liked it Better than the First,We watched this as a family and felt it was better and more family oriented than the first movie that was darker and grosser in its mummy character. The character of the son makes this more of a family pick. He was cast well and was a good mini hero. We loved seeing the famous Egyptian sites and will use this as a good excuse to look them up to learn more. It was a little long for our Saturday evening movie but it was good enough that we didn't mind relaxing the bedtimes. We didn't particularly like that there was so much skin showing but I guess this makes the movie appealing to wider audiences. We plan to watch the Scorpion King movie soon.
2,The Crummy,"It's bad. It's really bad. The action's o.k., and the effects are nice, but it's bad. I thought the first mummy was really fun, had a nice story, and was all together a pretty good movie. While watching ""The Mummy 2: The Crummy"", I kept saying to myself ""What the (expletive)?"". The little pigmy monsters, the elaborate sand models the kid made, the balloon, the fake looking CG when mixed with real people, the...everything.The reason I give it two stars instead of zero, is that I liked the way it flushed out the story between the mummy and his woman, expanding on the footage shown at the beginning of the first film. If you really liked the first one, a lot, watch this movie once to get that back story, and then forget about it. Or don't watch it at all, so you can have a fond memory of the first one. Actually, you should go rent the old 1932 version of the mummy. It's great!"
2,Big win for WWF fanatics -- Cheesy AND Predictable,"I liked the first movie ""The Mummy"", but would not recommend ""The Mummy Returns"" to anyone, sober.Really weak plot and dialogue. Be prepared for *hammy* acting and poor character development. Painful at times.Special effects OK, but not as dramatic as 1st movie. Certain creature near the end was really fake looking. ...like producers ran-out of time and just said, ""good enough"".Nearly everything was predictable -- only one or two surprises.Very disappointed."
1,??????????????,"if everyone liked this,what movie did i stumble into????this was ''alright'' up until the ridiculous ending.nowadays,especially with sequals,prequals,1/2 way through it seems like the director is on autopilot.it had its moments,some good ideas/effects.but compared to the first movie,it COMPLETELY LACKED EVERYTHING.THE CHEMISRTY WAS NON EXISTANT.THE ADDED CHARACTORS WERE BUFFOONS.why do i always get suckered into dishing out $$$$$$ to sequals i know thats gonna rot?my only hope is the matrix.only the ghost of ED WOOD could muck that up."
1,Please no more sequels!!,"The Mummy was no modern marvel by any sense, but this poorly acted, cheesey special effects ridden disaster is not worth the effort. The characters are flat and lifeless and seem to spout off innane comments and one-liners throughout the films pitiful life. The story and plot are non-existent and .... Don't waste your time."
2,Great Movie!,This movie is great. It has greater action than the first movie. But what i really love about it is that it is worth the difference between a VHS and a DVD. The bonus matirel is packed with cool information. There is even a suprise before the movie that is really cool...
1,ONE WORD: THE WORST MOVIE...EVER!,"Since when Egyptian 5000 years ago spoke ARABIC?Since when Anubis (Mummufication GOD) had an ""evil"" army?Since when there is was a Scorpion King in ancient Egypt?STORY: D-ACTING: D-EFFECT: C- (The ""Magic Carpet"" effect is horrible)OVERALL: D-I think the director and rest of ""Mummy"" franchise should leave the town and make a ""better mouse trap"""
2,The Monkey Returns,"I was expecting a great dvd experience, especially since I had no time to see it in theatre. Thank goodness I didnt see it in the theatre, and thank good I rented this movie instead of buying it. For people who make fun of ""No Brain Action Movies"", stop, cause they are supposed to be fun. However, this is a no brain movie with baddddd action. Infact, not enough action. You will note the following:-For some reason, the ""evil"" Imhotep from the first movie plays a little girl with no good powers.-The CGI Scorpian King at the end was sad, really sad. I would've prefered the Rock(Scorpion King)in a ""human"" body.-The comedy in this movie is bad, just not horrible.-Brendan Frasier's over-acting-THIS MOVIE IS NOT NON-STOP ACTION! TOO MUCH TALKING.I would not even pay 5 dollars to BUY this movie. If you like ACTION-MONSTER THRILLERS with LITTLE ACTION, BAD MONSTERS, and NO THRILLS, then buy this movie right away!!!!!"
2,........zzzzzzzzzzz,"I fell asleep several times while watching mummy returns. No character development and thin plot. All the CGI looked cartoony and did not hold my attention. Buy it, watch it, and shelf it next to Mummy#1 and fuget-about-it."
1,i would have put -5 but they didnt have it,Well whats to say it is the worst movie i have ever see. The first one was very good but this one lacked. The special f/x almost made me walk out of the theater.
4,Jeff's review,"A good action packed movie , I enjoyed it more than the first one , also check out the Scorpion King."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!,"Wait for the re-release of the ultimate edition DTS set.I cannot believe Universal are trying to sell this one disc Dolby Digital edition,but what baffles me more is the fact people are buying it!Just take a look at Universal's track record in this department for a moment;first it was The Mummy,followed by Nutty Professor II uncensored director's cut DTS,American Pie,Notting Hill,Meet Joe Black and Patch Adams. The last 4 titles do not deserve Ultimate Edition DTS re-releases.What is going to be next from Universal-The Ultimate Edition really really really uncensored version of Nutty Professor II?Why don't Universal release titles that deserve a DTS Ultimate edition,like The Frighteners.This great film has a pitiful DVD,while it was released on laserdisc in a Signature Selection box set. Universal,release your 2 disc sets first and research something known as customer satisfaction!"
5,the rock turns in a venomous performance.,"this is the first performance in the mummy series movies with the rock of the WWE. in 2001, they had a preview of the movie on the WWE with goldust and booker t critiquing it. i thought the critique they did was pretty hilarious. this movie has non-stop action throughout. you want pretty ladies? feast your eyes on rachel weisz. there is plenty of special effects throughout this movie."
4,"It's the Mummy, duh!",Brendan Fraser and Oded Fehr again. More good storyline. The egyptian history behind the main storyline. I mean come on.
4,"Good, but not great","I have watched the original mummy over a hundred times. i love the movie, and i couldnt wait to see the sequel. While it isnt as good as the original, it is still a good movie full of action, and the humor that made the original so enjoyable. While a few of the special effects were a little cheesy, it is still a good movie, and well worth the time to sit down and watch it. I recommend buying this movie and watching it, just so you can keep the collection going."
2,Let down,"I love Brendan Frasier, but I did not enjoy this movie at all. The technology that made the first film couldn't save this one. If you have nothing better to spend you money on, go for it."
5,a thrill ride,Entertaining and better than the original. More action and more fun. It's good. Score: 97/100
1,This movie has nothing to do with mummys,"The Mummy Returns is about 40 times worse than The 1999 film, The Mummy, which was also horrible. Why movies like this make so much money I don't think I will ever understand. Not only is it bad but it looks like they didn't even try to make it good, the specisl effects are worse than that of Air Force One or The Langoliers. I spit on this movie and its filmmakers, especially you Stephen Sommers, you ruined 4 hours of my life from viewing both of these lumps of dung. This film is the second worst of the year in my opinion."
2,DIS-AP-POINT-ING,"Critics complained a lot about THE MUMMY. They said it was too corny, that the historical facts were inacturate (sp?), and that there were many plot holes. Well, I said ""tough beans"" to them because I enjoyed THE MUMMY a lot. Now THE MUMMY RETURNS, that's where I agree with the critics. I was so disappointed with this sequel because the plotline was so vague and so disposable (sp?) that it makes THE MUMMY'S plotline seem solid. It has something to do with some magical braclet that supposed to bring back some Scorpian King...ah, who cares?! I really hope they don't make a third sequel."
3,"Eagerly anticipated this, but found I was disappointed","What bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of plot. I know it hinges a bit on sci-fi, but not only was it hard to follow, it was not very believable.Character development was definitely left by the wayside in the director's quest to dazzle us with special effects and explosive scenes.Rachel Weisz' character was so far removed from her first appearance in The Mummy that I found a hard time believing it. Gone was the slightly ditzy Evie of before, and I found myself wishing to see a bit of it here and there in the second offering.But their son Alex was a delight. I loved his character.I think the director could have made this into a lot better movie by writing a better plot, fleshing out the characters better, and adding more believability to the entire thing.It's worth watching, but I have to agree, if you've seen the first one, this one will not meet your expectations. The first one was by far better."
3,Great... if you didn't see the first one,"Having enjoyed THE MUMMY for it's humour and S-FX, I eagerly awaited this followup, only to be somewhat disappointed. You will probably find that this movie will hold more for you if you didn't see the first one. It is still entertainment, it's not bad, but the replication of jokes and scenarios from the first movie wears a little thin - been there done that. However, on the plus side, the addition of 'The Rock' as The Scorpion King is a good one (if only minor), the development of Patricia Velasquez's character is interesting, and Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser are terrific (although a bit awkward as a married couple). It is definitely a Sunday afternoon veg-out movie."
2,Could it get any worse?,"Poor Brandon. He was so close to being the next indiana jones, but this movie crushed him. It was brutally bad, the story line was exactly the same as the first. And could there be anymore mush in it? I mean you get the idea that brandon and his wife love eachother, but every 5 minutes they are gushing with how much they love eachother. Bad, bad, bad movie. And anamakson (I know the spelling is off) could she be any more modern day? She is supposed to be reincarnated and it is a terrible job. I can't tell you enough, rent it but do not waste your money owning it."
1,"Too bulky, heavy and does not bring far away objects close enough.","It came on time, but it is a very heavy unit.Definitely you need a tripod stand capable of holding a binocular of some 5 pounds.I put it on a tripod stand, aimed at a marquee some quarter of a mile away, andI could NOT see many details.Since I cannot use it, for what I bought for,I called the seller and asked for a RETURN LABEL.He said that I have to pay for returning it.The POST OFFICE would charge me some US $20.00 to return it.From now on, any time I buy items from a store or on the NET,I will ask about their return policy, and if any, who pays for shipping it back.I decided to keep it for the looks of it."
2,"Unsturdy handle, feels like it will break fast","Okay - I've had this for a week and have used it maybe six times. I was totally disappointed by this tea kettle and am returning it today. I love Oxo, but this did not deliver. The handle pushes forward to open the spout, which is a strange way to do it. That movement seems to be what makes it feel very flimsy. The handle actually wiggles back and forth when you pick it up. It doesn't appear to be broken. I think that is just the design. Both my husband and I are waiting for that handle to just fall off one day while we are pouring boiling water. Clearly we aren't waiting for that! Too bad."
2,Tedious espionage actioner,"Contrary to the expectation of impressive gadgetry and topnotch thrills, ""Mission Impossible"" is a dreary and overcomplicated action thriller. The only incredible thing about it is that almost the entire cast is killed within the first half hour.There are a few powerful action sequences (such as the climax involving the helicopter and the train) but the plot entanglements (with plenty of twists but no surprises) mar what might have otherwise been a good cinematic version of the hit TV series, which, in itself, was never short on suspense or sophistication."
4,Good -- as long as you're not a fan of the TV show,"a good film when considered as a stand alone. some of the, errr,let's call them 'changes' (or 'liberties'?) taken with the GospelAccording To TV cause problems with fans of the original show(some of whom not unreasonably can't get over what was done withMartin Landau's character)i would say that the casting of Kittridge ( Henry Czerny ) whohad recently cropped up in Clear And Present Danger, was a smartmove"
5,Best action movie of the decade!,"This is BY FAR the best action movie of the 90's. A fantastic epic film, with the sites becoming more and more exotic until we reach the climax in the [UK-France] Chunnel. This last chase scene by itself is better than most action movies of this decade.I've seen this movie more than 10 times and I see something new each time.Highly Recommended."
4,"Thrilling, but somewhat confusing at first watch","This film is a mixture of suspence/action and mystery. It can get a bit complicated so I really recommend a 2nd viewing to catch everything. Though this came out a while ago, the movie doesn't feel dated. And the action scenes are just as great as they were when this film first came out. Especially the wire act. Really tense stuff. Tom Cruise really carries this film, he's very spot on and engaging in this. Its a great role for him. All in all, a real solid film."
1,The Movie self-destructed in five seconds,"It's a good movie, if you ignore the fact that there is no plot. Tom Cruise stumbles about the movie, going from place to place. Why? NOBODY KNOWS! The plot twisted and turned more that a snake stuck in a cement truck drum. Why does Ethan Hunt hang himself from a wire a few inches above a sensor-rigged floor? NOBODY KNOWS! Why is Mr. Phelps throwing fake blood around? NOBODY KNOWS! This movie should have been scrapped. It's Impossible that a movie could be this horrible. Best thing to come out of it was the theme song."
1,"If you loved both the TV series, you'll HATE this.","I thought this movie was garbage, for the main reason of what they did to one of the main characters of the mission impossible TV series. This character of the TV series would not be like the one in the movie. I don't think the writers of the movie ever saw the series. If i could give this movie less that one star i would."
4,Thrilling And Intelligent.,"""Mission: Impossible"" is a thrilling and intelligent thriller with enough twists and turns to always keep us interested. Also, this movie has lots of wonderful style and great action sequences. Brian DePalma is a great director who always presents interesting and intriguing works. ""Mission: Impossible"" is complex with a great plot and thrills. I was never bored and always interested. This is a dynamite thrill ride."
3,This review will self destruct in 5 seconds,"The movie isn't really that good because it doesn't have any action. Okay, it has SOME action, but not much. I also don't like the DVD that much. The only bonus thing it has is a teaser trailer. Well, the trailer was cool and the movie had good music--BUT STILL! No, I havent seen the TV show. If all you people don't like this review, you have no right to criticize me because I like all the sequels. <giggle giggle giggle>"
4,Important Work for the Development of an Understanding of Basic Economics,"Dr. Sowell picks up here where he left off with ""Basic Economics."" For the average person who would like to learn more about economics on a practical and not just theoretical level, start with ""Basic Economics"" and then move on to ""Applied Economics."" The author does a wonderful job in both books of explaining concepts and giving practical examples to illustrate the concepts. There is a good chance you will walk away from this book with a brand new perspective on certain accepted policies and ideas. Dr. Sowell is especially adept at making the point that politicians and much of the public live in the world of short term thinking, while economics forces you to think beyond stage one."
1,Basic Volleyball,"Bought this DVD for my grand-daughter who is just beginning to play. She was concerned about her schools upcoming tryouts wanting to know what the game was about and so not make any mistakes. Yes, it did show the basic hits, but lacked any detail on the layout of the court, the placement of the players, the rules of the game, the things a beginner needs to know just to walk onto the court, etc.. I went on-line and printed out a diagram of the court and the rules of the game. I showed her where the players were placed, the rotation of players and discussed the rules. All of which could have easily worked into and fit on this short DVD."
5,my favorite oldham album,"but not my favorite palace album. That would be There is No One. Anyway, I just spent too much time checking out the reviews for James Blunt, and was befuddled at how many people passionately love him, when he obviously isn't that good. I really think what's going on there is that people want him to be deep and a genius so they make him one-so they get to listen to ""deep"" music without having to be challenged in any way. I know music is personal, but Blunt is tripe. But here, with Mr. Oldham, I could understand how opinions could defer so widely. His music is difficult, and therefore when you like it, it is really a personal, intimate thing. I love this album, and maybe even if you don't you could understand how someone could, unlike Mr. Blunt's pablum."
5,Metaphor Pedagogy Book,"This book was awesome! It was a required read for my masters program, so I thought it would be boring like all of the other books that were required. It turned out to be a giant metaphor story with underlying relevant facts about teaching methods. I would read this book even if it was not required. The chapters were short, entertaining, and funny. A very easy read. If you are an educator or in the business of education you need to read this book. This was the only book that I did not sell back."
3,COOLEST CUTTING BOARD FOR 2008!!!!,"I USED IT FOR CUTTING UP MEATS AND MAKING SANDWICHES. IT HELPED, ONLY THING IS ITS A LIL SMALL."
1,didn't last long,"This dsl modem installed very easily. It was completely plug and play after the software installation. It worked perfectly for 2 or 3 days then stopped working. The lights on the panel indicated all was normal but I was unable to access the internet. I turned it off, turned it on, unplugged it, plugged it back in, held my breath until my face turned purple but nothing helped. I plugged my old, intermittent, unreliable dsl modem back in and regained internet access. The defective Zoom unit was returned to amazon for a refund."
2,same comment as the other book from victoria magazine,"arrived fast and like new condition but big bore, nothing in it. i threw it awayi was hopeing for some ideas to decorate my apartment but forget that"
2,"Good clock, terrible radio","The clock, display, and alarm features are all good. The radio, however, overrides these benefits with poor reception. All stations come in with static. So when you wake to radio at low volume levels, the static competes with your ability to enjoy music, news, or weather reports.I finally gave up and have replaced the unit with another manufacturer in the same price range. I will not have the smartset time, but I will be able to listen to the radio or news with clear reception."
4,Wings Wasn't All Silly Love Songs,"The final Wings album and probably most overlooked, too. This is a nice collection of songs, but it is disapointing that it didn't fare as well as it should have. It has lots of steady rockers, (""Spit It On,"" ""Old Siam, Sir""), your typical hit singles, (""Getting Closer,"" and the disco-flavored ""Arrow Through Me""), and a pair of songs by the Rockestra. The Rockestra was arranged by Paul, and had people like Pete Townshend and David Gilmour, with members of bands like Led Zeppelin. It has a nice jazzy sign-off called ""Baby's Request."" The bonus tracks are nice to have, although not essential. They include Paul's solo Christmas single ""Wonderful Christmas Time"" and it's b-side ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reggae."" This is a must for anyone who doubts Wings as a more than a pop band."
4,Fine back to basics album for McCartney,"Clearly influenced by new wave and the power pop movement, McCartney returned to his melodic rock roots producing a fine album. The strongest tracks include the single Getting Closer, Arrow Through Me, Spin it on and Baby's Request.Back to the Egg is a very loose concept album about radio and its power to reach an audience. This conceit allows McCartney to dabble in a variety of interesting styles. The second half of the album, while it has many highlights, is more fragmentary. It's clear that McCartney had a number of unfinished songs and he used the suite at the end of Abbey Road as inspiration to finish it.The three bonus tracks are fun particularly Daytime/Nightime Suffering which highlights McCartney's gifts as both arranger and songwriter."
5,Spin it on!!!,"Absolutely amazing Album - when i first heard ""Getting closer"",""Old siam sir"" or ""So glad to see yuo"" i was amazed with their power - tjey really kick your speakers out!!!a great album by such a great artist like paul!!!"
3,Not nearly as bad as the reviews made it out to be!,"This really is a pretty good record. When I first bought it in 1979, I thought that it was the best rocking McCartney album and my opinion hasn't changed. Sure, there are a few filler tracks, but what album doesn't have them, even from such ""genius"" types like Billy Joel, Elton John, and even the late John Lennon? With songs like ""Old Siam Sir,"" ""Rockestra Theme,"" and his best rocker ever, ""To You,"" this McCartney disc rates at least three stars, if not more.Give the guy a break! When you've written so many classic songs, it's easy to dismiss a ""good"" McCartney record."
3,Someone's Got To Roll Tonight,"BACK TO THE EGG suffers from the same problem as so many McCartney/Wings LPs: after a promising side 1, side 2 dies.There is some reprieve from that problem on BACK TO THE EGG; after the drudgery of ""Winter Rose/Love Awake"" and the sheer boredom of ""After The Ball/Million Miles,"" there's the oddly touching ""The Broadcast"" and a thrilling ""So Glad To See You Here,"" maybe the best rocker Macca did since BAND ON THE RUN."
3,"3 1/2 Stars, actually-- this is a good one!","I'm a huge Macca fan, but I don't rave about every single album like it was Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road. Some people are inclined to declare everything he's done a 'masterpiece.' Well, despite the hard knocks this album has taken, I think it is pretty darn solid material. The best thing about it is the strong, rock sound-- a welcome return to some raspy, belting vocals. Not a big seller, and not a fave of Macca himself, this is the true underrated gem in the Wings' catalogue. Treat yourself to some of Paul's more obscure tracks."
4,Nancy Drew book review...........,"Nancy's friends assist her in solving a mystery of The Message In The Hollow Oak. Nancy's enemy Kit Kadle tries to stop her from solving the mystery and finding the Treasure. Nancy stays at a historical dig while solving the mystery. Some of the college students Nancy met at the dig are: Bob, Art, and Julie Ann. The dig was in Illinois. Nancy's aunt's friend told Nancy about the Mystery. When Nancy's friend Bob gets kid-napped by Kit Kadle, he sends Nancy a telegraph saying that he would only set Bob free if she gave him $5,000 and the Treasure. When she got the telegraph, she had the boys at the dig make a dummy sack with ripped-up paper and some rocks. In the end, Kit Kadle and Nancy come face to face for the Treasure.I really liked reading this book; I give it four out of five stars.Gabby N....."
5,Excellent Saab Book,"If you're a fan of the Saab 99 or 900 this book should be in your personal library. Along with a succinct history of Saab up to the creation and production of the 99, on through the introduction of the turbo to Saab engine design and then working through the early 900 series up until the purchase of Saab by GM, this book is pretty comprehensive. You need to keep in mind it was written with Great Britain in mind, but it does make pretty thorough references to the USA spec cars for those of us Saabists here on the American continent. I wish there was a book this good covering the 900 after GM's purchase of Saab and continuing through the 9-3, but there's not (yet). If you like or are interested in Saab design and some history, this book is worth picking up."
3,Not impressed...,"Like H. G. Wells' Time Machine book, this book starts out well, exploring and describing the wonders of time travel, and then loses itself in a fictional ""future"" created by the author. It's difficult to suspend your disbelief in a future envisioned by a 1972 writer in a post-apocolyptic like world. Just like the Time Machine, the book changes to be less about time travel and more about the microcosm of his little fictional future. I guess I care more about the time travel itself than some of the ""author's vision of the future"" places it can take you."
4,Pretty funny and good read,"This is the third book in a series of books about three friends, and their lives with Shape shifters. Angelina disappeared in the last moments of the previous book (the two books leading up to this are Pack Challenge, and Go Fetch). It turns out she has been rescued from Hyenas (not so good shape shifters) by Siberian Tigers, and sent to live with one of them in Hill billy country.Nikolai, said Hill Billy Tiger is pretty darn sexy, but he is a loner. Meantime, Angelina's friends don't know what has happened to her and Angelina is wishing, well, for a short time, that maybe the Hyenas had got her after all.Laurensten does a great line in hilarious dialogue, but she is also pretty good on the other stuff. This is one crazy, sexy fun novel. Its brim full of good nature, and sexual tension. The Chemistry between Nikolai ( the tiger) and Angelina sizzles."
4,Tour: The Opportunities Presented,"John Ashenden is a tour guide. He has a group of Americans from the West Coast. Laura Stratton, one of the guests on this rather expensive tour, dies in an Oxford Hotel. Lewis and Morse are called. The tourists are told about the Wolvercote Buckle, a significant artifact displayed at the Ashmolean. It seems that the dead woman carried a costly jewel with her that belongs with the Wolvercote Tongue. The theft of that jewel is a severe disappointment to a scholar, Theodore Kemp. The remaining plot could have been devised by a Shortz. It is intricate. The format is simple, but exciting."
4,Great cake topper,"I ordered this and didn't receive the product for almost 2 weeks, 2 days past the delivery date indicated on my order. So I contacted the seller and they were very prompt with their response. They appologized and resent the product overnight. This was for my son's 7th birthday cake, and it turned out awesome with this product as cake toppers. Great product for what I wanted to use it for however I over paid online. I went to Disneyland a few weeks ago and they were selling this[...]"
4,A well-crafted high-tension thriller that drags in places,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite its exaggerations and melodramatic touches. Pacino and Crowe give fine performances, and the glimpse we get into the world of big tobacco companies and highly-paid journalists is fascinating. Unfortunately, there are numerous slow patches throughout this 2.5 hour movie. They could have cut about 20 minutes without losing anything important, and the result would have been more watchable. With that qualifier, I'd recommend ""The Insider"" to anyone who enjoys dramatic pseudo-documentary movies."
4,beast wars!,"Its not easy being a whistle blower, especially when you are blowing the whistle on the tobacco company who by the way looked so slimmy and evil in this movie ..well crow's character, wigand did just that...suffered and lost everything in the process..or did he? Thinking that this is news worthy info that America should know..he gets indirectly involved with unsavory corporate news broadcasters...talk about bad karma It is a great movie, makes one think if those smoking prevention commercials for teens are a direct result of wigand's disclosure about tobacco companies and what news networks omit by choice..go see this movie and figure it out!"
5,I wish I could rate this a 10...,"This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. (Or at least in the top 3).Russell Crowe is amazing. Really what else can be said that others haven't already articulated. He should have won the Academy Award for this, why he didn't is beyond me.Pacino and Crowe together have excellent chemistry and Michael Mann, as always, makes a movie that runs over two and half hours seem like no time at all and leaves you wanting more.The soundtrack is moody and beautiful and fits the pastel scene work incredibly.From the Missisippi District Attorney to the scumbag tobacco heads, this movie shows just how disgusting and seedy that people can be and it also shows that there are still people willing to take a courageous stand for their beliefs.EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT, buy this movie, you will not regret it. By the way, did I say that it was EXCELLENT."
4,About the DVD screen format !!,"It is 2.35 AnamorphicThe only thing I noticed unusual is that the horiz. black bars are uneven, 33% on top and 66% on bottom. Its not 50/50 or horiz. centered as with most other 2.35:1. It's NOT a BIG DEAL, just a little horiz. offset.Great Movie, still worth purchasing !!"
2,UNCONVINCING,Something between a documentary and a movie there are serious problems with the plot. Remove Pacino and it is worth very little. This is a pity because the topic is important.
5,Don't think corperations have too much say? Check this out!,"This a beautifully made & deeply spiritual film (Michael Mann's best, I think) about two men who discover the difficulty of achieving success in modern American life when the power structure is controlled by a few multi-billion dollar corperations w/ mutual interests. Russle Crowe & Al Pacino's characters both learn some hard lessons about what being succesfull in the 90's really requires."
5,Great reference tool!,"This book is an awesome reference tool! It does not have instructions on how to put the blocks together, but a quilt-savvy person may be able to figure it out. The book appears complicated but I found it was easier to use the second time around."
5,CD Purchase,"I've been looking for this CD for months on iTunes - not released in US. Purchased item from vendor listed - item was received in less than ten day - no scratches, played well and downloaded to my iTunes. Thanks for the quick, fast service!"
3,"Embarrasing, frankly, for Bono, Wenders, and their fans","Now, I love Bono. U2 is my favorite band. And I love Wim Wenders. Until the End of the World is my favorite movie of all time. Wings of Desire is on the favorites list, too.But I just hated Million Dollar Hotel. Just hated it. I couldn't believe that it come from two artists whose work I love so much. I understand some of the concepts Bono was trying to work with (especially when you imagine Winona Ryder, their original choice, in the Milla Jovovich's role), but overall this movie was boring, directionless, and nonsensical. I wish I could say otherwise, believe me. But it failed to captivate me at all. I was sort of embarrassed for everyone involved."
3,John Ruskin wrote children's stories?,"This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre, if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme, built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who, after being treated well or poorly, rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact, that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other, making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale, but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS: This reviews a different edition of the story, apparently not listed at Amazon. My 1962 edition was illustrated by Sardo Nardini. The pictures are competent and colorful but, like the story itself, forgettable."
3,"Not bad, but...","it softens water, but the connection between the showerhead and the hose is somewhat loose, so sometimes it leaks."
2,Good if you got extra parts,"Length:: 0:45 MinsMy name is Steve Monas and I am the co-author ofShoestring Venture: The Startup Bible. This product is good, as long as you have extra parts. As shown on the video, the parts are made cheaply and broke."
5,"""A True Account of a Marine Grunt in Vietnam""","As a member of a Marine rifle company in Vietnam in 1968-69, I found this book to be dead on, in its portrayal of the day to day life of a grunt. This book, for the most part stays clear of the political messages and other distractions that infect many of the other books about Vietnam. If one was to ask the author why this would be, I would guess that his response would be, that a Marine in the bush does not have time to reflect upon anything other than the mission at hand. I was also glad to see a book about combat in Vietnam,that was written by a black Marine. The year of 1967 was a deadly year for the Marines, especially for those Marines in and around the DMZ. The NVA were determined to kill as many Marines as possible, in order to sway public opinion in the United States. They (NVA)did this knowing that they would probably lose every battle and suffer untold casualities."
2,egineering failures,Not as detailed as I would like ;Some iteresting facts; More on the emotioal resons than factsOnly covered 6 or 7 events.
2,Tedious answer to a stupid question,"This book tries to answer the question of why the stuff built by engineers break, what a stupid quesion. Stuff breaks and stops working all the time, that's why we have quality control in factories. If someone thinks we can make something perfectly the first time and every time he must've been born yesterday or smoking. Think about the first plane built or the first car, the first train, the first computer, MP3 players that stops working in a week, umbrellas that flip in the wind... Maybe people don't die when these things break, maybe they do... but this has always been how technology develops---it improves over time.The title of the book suggests that things built by God do not fail, wrong! Humans get sick, ozone layer gets holes, species go extinct, the Old Man of the Mountain falls flat on his face, and how about birth defects, the list goes on.Not a well thought out book. And trust me when I say the writing style puts even a true nerd to sleep."
2,Excellent start but falls flat,"This book has an interesting goal: To explain engineering failures. But instead of an in-depth failure analysis of the Hyatt hotel, Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and buses, the reader gets the same simple ideas repeated again and again. The Hyatt hotel disaster is mentioned in detail three times before its chapter. That chapter just retells the story and adds little value or insight. This book needs better organization and more real detail and in-depth analysis."
2,Save yourself the time...,"The book itself was in good condition and promptly shipped.... however, the content of the book leaves a lot to be desired. What could have been accomplished in one chapter is drawn out repeatedly to cover 200 pages. Very boring. Overall message is one of merit, but too much repetition."
2,Not what I expected :$,"If you enjoy Gabriel's specials then this is not for you. The friends are not great (i think out of the 18 friends, i sort of liked 3) and the DVD is designed to where fluffy opens all 6 or 7 shows with 10mins of his stuff and then it's the friends. :( I bought it at full price and I'm just not impressed with it. Fluffy needs to make more DVDs with just him. Make more specials!!!!!"
5,Great Fun for All Ages!,"I would have loved to had this book when I was a child. The non-linearity of the chapters makes it a perfect ""browser's book"" -- a book which you can pick up and flip open to any page and read interesting, amusing and humorous accounts of day to day life in the Civil War army. This is one of the most fun books I've picked up in a long time."
5,"Civil War reenactors, buy this!","I am a Civil War reenactor, and this book has been an excellent source of ideas for first person scenarios and ideas for living history. It is an insightful, unique record of the soldier's life for living historians or students of history. I would highly recommend this engaging book."
3,"Great book, aweful translation!","I agree with one of the reviewers who found this book ""painful"" to read, yet Nabokov compared it to Joyce! How could he e wrong? Well, he read the book in Russian! So what I did is to dig deeper to find another version. I am happy to say that the Maguire&Malmstad;Petersburggives justice to the book. First, it lacks the fairly pathetic introduction that the Penguin classic version has. The intro is sneaked as urtext and all it does is to vomit on Stalin and the 1937 events, which happened after Bely's death. It also has the presumption of telling the reader what to think about the book, what to ""see"" and what to expect. In contrast the Maguire&Malmstad; version has a meaningful and helpful introduction, the translation is thoughtful and appropriate English is used to translate the improbable Symbolist verbiage used by Bely. I read both, and I feel I read a great book )M&M;) and an awful one (Penguin). I very strongly recommend reading this book in its good version!"
1,this is crap,"terrible cd, it dies today have completely changed their image and sound, dont waste your money. if you absolutely have to have it, download it and if you still feel like supporting them then buy forever scorned but otherwise, screw this band."
1,Corey Feldman Must be Stopped.,"Worst movie ever made. Corey Feldman, please, please please stop making movies. Nobody wants to see your work. How can you expect anyone to buy this thing. My 10 year old nephew could make a better movie with his flip cam."
1,DO NOT BUY - NO CD/DVD INCLUDED!!!!,"The book is meant to be used with a CD and DVD, and this one doesn't include it. Feel totally robbed!! Search again for the title and CD or DVD to get the set. The description of this item is dishonest not to mention the omission!"
4,"Excellent Book, But no CD?","I got this book to learn French and absolutely love the content of the book! It makes it very simple and easy for beginners. However, in the beginning of the book it tells you about the CDs that go along with it and how to use them but there are no CDs! You have to purchase them separately for $60! You can still use the book without the CDs just fine but it is better for beginners to be able to listen to the dialogue."
3,No CD,"I have no complaints with the book. I did think that it came with a CD, but it does not. Guess I was mislead by reading the reviews. But, its rough learning a language when you can`t hear the words pronounced properly! I do not believe that a person could learn the French language properly by using this book alone. All you would learn is how to ms-pronounce words. But with that said, add this book to Rosetta Stone or another source of language learning and this book will be great."
3,Ultimate French Beginner-Intermediate (Book) (LL(R) Ultimate Basic-Intermed),It needs phonic spelling if the student does not buy the CDs / tapes. It should have a workbook.
1,Is it over yet?,"After 4 months of trying to plow through this book, I finally gave up on page 121 and read the last page. I kept hoping things would get better; The pace would pick up and I might care about these people. To no avail. A thourough disappointment. start to abbreviated finish."
1,Uhhh?,"What happened to the reviews already left? This game blows, what a waste. Don't go too fast and hit a car or you will crash..."
3,Nice Graphics - but gets boring quickly,"The graphics in this game were stunning. And there is definately a ""fun factor"" to tearing up a city, taking massive jumps off of bridges and smashing up other cars.But the fun on this game wore off within about 1 hour. It just seemed like it was doing more of the same thing over and over again.I'm not a big fan of racing games. So I would imagine that someone who likes racing games might find this much better than I do. But, even so, I found some of the previous Burnout games and other racing games (Midtown Madness, Project Gotham) to be more engaging because they made it possible to play multi-player on the same console - when I can play it with my kids, it tends to have much more value for me.So, if you're only moderately interested in racing games, and especially if you like to play them multi-player (without having to go online), then you're probably not going to enjoy this one for very long."
4,Great Game Altogether,"This game is a blast. I actually haven't played the other Burnouts, so that's not influencing my review. I actually think the other people are relying too much on the game having aspects of the older versions.The only reason I can't give this game 5 stars is because it doesn't have any co-op mode, which really bothers me, and the menus are a bit convoluted and confusing.Other than that, the game is so fun, the takedown modes are great, and I really like the open city. I noticed one reviewer said they didn't like it because it didn't have a speedometer or tach. It doesn't have those because it doesn't matter. This is an arcade racer and those things don't matter like they do in PGR or Gran Turismo."
1,SUCKS,"This game sucks, you have to keep an eye on the map at all times which is unbelievably hard while driving 100+ miles per hour. There is no sense of direction whatsoever, you just stumble onto races."
4,Pretty happy :),The book came actually a lot quicker than i was expecting and it made me very happy. the book was in good condition and there are no problems at all :) very satisfied thank you :D
1,We Are The World meets Journey,When the cast of We Are The World and the band members of Journey had illegitimate children they named them Doug and the Mystics. Doug and the Mysics successfully create Prozaic induced songs about what seem to be important issues. Later these songs proove to have no real central concept or meaning.
4,Somebody needs to test it before they write a description.,"T.V. works great...only the description says, ""front firing stereo speakers"" --it is mono...the description says ""glow in the dark remote"" -- I've spent hours in the dark waiting for it to glow. The inputs (monoraul) for DVD or VCR are in the front. Coax in the back.One other problem -- the remote also changes channels on my 42"" tv. You'd think Toshiba would code their remotes for different products."
2,A Masterpiece? Really?,I wish I could give this two and a half stars because I feel like it wasn't a total waste of time. I enjoy low budget horror films but to call this a masterpiece is going a bit too far I think. It kept losing my attention on and off throughout whole thing. Comparing it to the films of Dario Argento and Mario Bava is hard to swallow too. It is what it is. A low budget American horror flick that's only good as mindless entertainment. I'd suggest that low-budget horror fans give it a rent and make up their own minds.
1,Ignorance,"As a romantic comedy it's standard fare. Ben Stiller does his usual array of funny facial expressions, and the female interest is very watchable. My main problem was Stiller's character's supreme ignorance of the arab-israeli dispute. It seemed as though he was trying to trivialise it. Coming from a supposed Rabbi - this was insensitive in the extreme. If this subject had to be brought into a harmless rom-com, then surely it could have been done with maybe a little more tact? Not all of us see suicide bombings and the humiliation of a people as light hearted rom com material."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Far too long, with many uneven patches, Keeping the Faith is a pleasing enough romantic comedy but not an especially good or memorable one."
4,Good God,"A charming light hearted look at love, religion, relationships and friendship. Definitely worth seeing if just for the ""nightmare date"" Stiller goes on."
5,why i love this movie.,"i have loved this movie for a long time,it is filled with friendship &love&respect for the differences between jewish people&gentiles.it is very well written."
